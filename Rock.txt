Anyone who knows you as I do
Anyone could fall in love with you
And I love you my darling
Anyone could lose his heart like me
Anyone who has eyes that can see
Anyone could fall in love like me
And I love you my darling
You're the star I reached for
You're a dream so rare
You're my greatest treasure
Nothing can compare
Anyone could want you for his own
Anyone not only mine alone
Anyone could fall in love with you
And I love you my darling
Anyone could fall in love with you
And I love you my darling<start>Feel blue, miles above you, the silver screen reach out
And touch you and the dark of the back row
This is a place where young lover go
When they want to be alone
Perfection has never crossed my lips
But is there any way to describe it
When two movie stars kiss
There is magic in the air, magic in the air
North of the city, on the quiet, quiet road
I find myself dreaming of days long ago
And their lonely, lonely theater where tragic movies play
He didn't find out that he loved her till she finally gone away
But they know that nothing lasts forever
We should be grateful for the time we have together
Is that enough to keep me from crying
Is that enough to keep me from lying<start>I could walk on and tell myself there's no room for you in my life
Pretend there's nothing left inside
Just throw us away
But I still believe, if you asked I'd walk into the fire for you
Uh huh, don't wanna leave you here like this
I keep holding on if there's something else
[Chorus]
I'm willing to lay my heartache down
Give me a reason to stay
It wouldn't take much to turn me around then stop me for leavin'
And give me a reason to stay
Just say the words I can surely stand on little compromise
Just reach out to me with your live I'll meet you half way
Give me some little sign, show me there's some hope for love inside your heart
Uh huh, what could it hurt to try a bit
Wanting her and more if we let it in
[Chorus]
You have me in your hands to keep here
Just stop me before we go too far
All you have to do is talk to me
If it's not too late, look into my heart
I'm willing
Don't need very much from you
I'm willing
What I'm tried to said to you
I'm willing to lay my heartache down
Give me a reason to stay
It wouldn't take much to turn me around then stop me for leavin'
And give me a reason<start>See-G-Em-G-D-G

Well, lucky number seven passed me by
Lucky number seven called my name and passed on by
Well he came back don't you know
With his brother six in tow
And that is how number thirteen wound up by my side.
And that is how I got these Lonesome Johnny Blues
How I got these Lonesome Johnny Blues
Got the Lonesome Johnny Blues
And there's nothing I can do
'Cept sing these sad old weary Lonesome Johnny Blues
Here we go
Grim Reaper he pulled up into my drive
Grim Reaper pulled his little old Chevrolet right up onto the goddamn drive
"Johnny, I haven't come for you
But I want someone who's dear to you
And the price you pay is to remain alive"
And I'll stay here with these Lonesome Johnny Blues
Stay here with these Lonesome Johnny Blues
With the Lonesome Johnny Blues
And there's nothing I can do
'Cept sing these sad old weary Lonesome Johnny Blues
Woah, no more trouble send him down the road, won't you please.
No more trouble won't you beat him up, won't you send him down the road
Trouble dumped out the trash
Ransacked the place for cash
And he wound up taking much more than I own
And he left me with these Lonesome Johnny Blues
Left me with these Lonesome Johnny Blues
With the Lonesome Johnny Blues
And there's nothing I can do
'Cept sing these sad old weary Lonesome Johnny Blues
Johnny Blues
The sad old weary Lonesome Johnny Blues

The sad old weary Lonesome Johnny Blues<start>(M. Barnes/J. Browne/D. Jarvis)
I've been down a highway
A lonesome, two-lane highway
Driving hard all night
I've been thinking about you
The truth is ringing so true
The picture's clearer in the light
I've been running from a good thing
It's been right here in my hands
You know you can't build a better love
Than what we had
You can climb a mountain
Way up on a mountain
Till you hang along thin air
You can cross the river
But the other side, it ain't no greener
Once you're standing there
See, I've been running from a good thing
It's been right here in my hands
You know you can't build a better love
Than what we had
Babe, I took so much for granted
And I've had so many doubts
But I'm gonna hold on to this good thing, baby
'Cause we've build the kind of love no one can tear down
You know you can't build a better love
You just can't build a better love
No, you can't build a better love
Than what we had
Than what we had
You just can't
You just can't
Ain't no better love<start>I'm better on a summer day when she's around,
I was on the tracks when the gate came down
Suddenly I recognized those bloodshot rear view mirror eyes as mine
I heard that whistle call my name
I almost drove away,
But Megan,
I had a feeling that you would be on that train
So I just waited there for you
Caught a ride to another town, where the air was clean and the sun never goes down
Everyone was standing in a line between the landing and the stairs
I heard somebody call my name
I almost climbed the stairs
But Megan,
I had a feeling that someday you'd meet me there
So I just waited there for you
I'm better on a summer day when I hear that name,
It's a dream that never came true
Sat down on the tracks and waited for a train
Take me back to you
Somebody came and took my hand
I finally had to go
But Megan,
I just want you to know, that I waited as long as I could
I'm better on a summer day when she's around<start>you got me so high, i got dibs on the stratosphere you got me feeling just like everyday's a leap year you always keep telling i got a problem with other guys when they're around there's always that look that i recognize you got me watching what i do and what i say you got me thinking 'bout things that don't matter anyway you keep me down for what i did and what i try you had me submissive, now baby i don't care that's why long live moto foxe today long live moto foxe a baby so fine i'm in the headlights like a mule deer blowing belts, going ninety in first gear the way you make me feel, to you i'd never lie i'm just looking for something that i can identify i'm up, i'm down about the way you make me feel all i can smell is burning rubber and spinning wheels ain't telling the rules for the games you wanna play for prior service, girl, i don't need back pay long live moto foxe today long live moto foxe long live moto foxe today long live moto foxe<start>I'm sitting by the window of your 32nd floor apartment
Waiting for your phone calls all to end
I'm sitting, watching wind blow, watching time go, watching cars go by
I'm waiting for these memories to begin
If I threw my guitar
Out the window so far down
Would I start to regret it?
Or would I smile and watch it slowly fall, fall, fall?
Garbage trucks and taxi cabs don't seem like they can reach me here
The clamor of jackhammers seems so faint
Well the way you treat me like the only slightly brings me down a lot
I don't think that I'll ever be the same
If I threw my guitar
Out the window so far down
Would I start to regret it?
Or would I smile and watch it slowly fall, fall, fall?<start>Your head on my shoulder
Two months youÃ¦?Â³e been a soldier
I feel so sick inside
Two months youÃ¦?? have been alive
So no one here knows your surname
No one knows from where you came
The Red Cross takes you to your grave
For which your government kindly pays
WHITE CROSS upon the hillside
There lies that unknown soldier
No one can remember your name
So here I stand by your graveside
The steel helmet lies upon your cross
They said you died for king and country
ThatÃ¦?Â¯ no comfort to the life youÃ¦?Â³e lost
FIRST LIGHT
The sniper saw you.
SECOND LIGHT
Took careful aim
THIRD LIGHT
He pulled the trigger on the gun
Dead dead dead.
WHITE CROSS upon the hillside There lies that unknown soldier
No one can remember your name
(So here beings the human harvest
Another war to end all wars
To give a life for rhyme nor reason
There are no words to justify the cause
So if our future lies in the scarlet fields
Who would be a patriot at the price of humanity?
WHO WOULD BE A PATRIOT AT THE PRICE OF HUMANITY?)
No, not me
NO NOT ME
WHITE CROSS upon the hillside
There lies that unknown soldier
No one can remember the
WHITE CROSS upon the hillside
There lies that unknown soldier
No one, no one, no one<start>Finally relax my weary limbs, just lay still
The ceiling undulates, the fault of some strange pill
I see your body in the doorway, so it seems
I must accept my eyes betray these half-dreams
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
The hours to the sunrise creep, but I don't care
There is no hope for any sleep if you're not here
In another scene, in another bed you're sleeping
So won't you come and visit me when I'm dreaming
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
I fear that I'll never sleep again
I fear that I'll never sleep again
I fear that I'll never sleep again
I fear that I'll never sleep again

She came on like the gales of winter
Blew my mind and broke my will
And left me there to die
Then she broke the spell she'd cast
The past was always there behind me
Rolling like the clouds at last
My dreams were in the sky
We went down to Galway town
To see the sights and see the races
All the things she did and said
I kept them in my mind
At the bus stop near the square
Her hair fell down around her face
I swore there was no more in store
I'd nothing left to find
We went down to Galway Town
Just to see what might be happening
We went down to Galway Town
We went down the mountain side
We went down to Galway Town
Just to see what might be happening
On the streets of Galway Town
Best place in the world to hide
We had burgers and some chips
And the rain it came a falling
Took a taxi to Salthill
With bad things in my head
She was wearing lovely clothes
The bouncer came and broke my nose
She said said oh just leave it go
I swore that he was dead
In the morning then
We went to walk along down by the sea shore
Talking about the night before
The music that they played
She said that she wanted home
And never more the world to roam
So that day I went away
And she moved down and stayed
I was in Croke Park
One rainy Sunday near the first of August
Watched the Leinster final
It was Dublin and Kildare
They led us a merry dance
We never even had a chance
At the side I'd say we tried
but swore I didn't care
Some day I'll go back out West
And see the streets we walked together
I don't know now where she is
I don't think that I care
If it gets too bad around here
I'll run like hell from all my problems
If you've got some blues
I'll tell you, you can lose them there<start>Lady in a turban, cocaine tree
Does a dance so rhythmically
She's cryin', and a singin' and having a time
Don't that cocaine tree look fine
You've got to put on your sailin shoes
Put on your sailing shoes
Everyone will start to cheer
When you put on your sailin' shoes
Well Jedidiah, he's got a dime
Says he catch a more fish, every time
Well I've got a line, and you've got a pole
And I'll meet you at the fishin' hole
You've got to put on your sailin shoes
Put on your sailing shoes
Everyone will start to cheer
When you put on your sailin' shoes
Doctor, doctor, I feel so bad
This is the worst day, I ever had
Have you this misery a very long time?
Well if you have, I'll lay it on the line
You've got to put on your sailin shoes
Put on your sailing shoes
Everyone will start to cheer
When you put on your sailin' shoes<start>I had joy and I was strong
and I was good at holding on
and I had heart and I had soul
and if I wanted to I could even make it snow
anytime
Did I look desperate to you
or did it look like I knew what I was doing
well all that is true
but as the days get longer
I can't remember
ifI'm getting worse or getting better
at playing this part
now where did it start
I had joy and I was strong
and I was good at holding on
and I had heart and I had soul
and if I wanted to I could even make it snow
anytime
Did I run circles around your heart
it was a private mission
it's an old tradition
that I cannot stop
'cause if I do they'll catch me and they'll never let me
keep my secret weapon hidden in the bedroom
at the top of the stairs
man, I hope it's still there
I had joy and I was strong
and I was good at holding on
and I had heart and I had soul
and if I wanted to I could even make it snow
anytime
All I wanna do is run
all I wanna do is fly
I've been saved so many times
just from staring at the sky
I'm still staring at the sky
and I'll never understand
why
I know my way through these woods
and though the paths have faded
and the trees have shaded
where my heart once stood still
I still feel it beating
all the years mean nothing
I am still believing
I can see the touching
of my soul and the sun
I close my eyes and I've won
I had joy and I was strong
and I was good at holding on
and I had heart and I had soul
and if I wanted to I could even make it snow
anytime
oh where did that little girl go
I need to find her
I need to find her so I can get through this show
do you know?<start>Don't look in her eyes
'Cause there's something that you can't disguise
Don't try to catch her eye
Don't kiss her when you say goodbye
Don't let her stand so close to you
She knows, she knows
She knows what to do
I know that you can't resist
The lips you could have kissed when
She was so close! Like the sea on your skin
You would like to get drowned, you would love to dive in
In a body-search pose, don't you love her?
She came out of the blue
Bright blue skies above her
Don't ever keep in touch
She doesn't really love you so much
Don't think about the words she said
She wants more than she could get
Don't read the books she gave you
Don't sing the songs she sang
She's not the one to save you
She's the sea your boat could have sunk in when
She was so close! Like the sea on your skin
You would like to get drowned, you would love to dive in
In a body-search pose, don't you love her?
She came out of the blue
Bright blue skies above her
Badadadada dadada dadada
Badadadada da da da da
Badadadada dadad dadada
Ba da da da da da da da
She was so close! Like the sea on your skin
You would like to get drowned, you would love to dive in
In a body-search pose, don't you love her?
She came out of the blue
Bright blue skies

Always down
Against the grave
You are
You say it's real life, down
Against the grave
We are
Maybe it's soft inside of hard
Fistful of mercy
Maybe it comes from where we are
Land of the thirsty, hungry
Lion heart
You say you feel life, down
Always down against the grave
We are
You say it's real life, down
Always down against the grave
You are
Maybe it's soft inside of hard
Fistful of mercy
Maybe it comes from where we are
Land of the thirsty, hungry<start>This is an imitation of a kiss.
An imitation's all it is and when I kiss you, it may look like a kiss.
Call it a kiss, this imitation of love.
It's an imitation of romance.
All hollow gestures and demands.
You get agressive.
So tired of routines, you go to extremes.
This imitation of romance.
There's a place I used to go, it's closed down long ago.
I'd lie down there in your darkness watching rivers flow.
Now it's an imitation of love.
No one's fooling no one.
And though you're here now, I'm so far away.
Let's call it a day.
This imitation of a kiss.
When it looks like all is lost here something reappears.
All my reasons leave the room now, leaving you still here.
This is an imitation of goodbye.
I say it's over all the time, yet I'm still with you.
Don't know why it is I can't resist this imitation of a kiss.<start>The sky was the color of morning
And the mountains surrounded
The ground as our bed.
The Spirit would rise without warning
Just to burn like the sun
That would soon warm our hands.
And the world was three days behind us,
And the world was three days ahead.
But for now no one could find us
In the wilderness.
Only bound by the burdens we brought,
But we were slowly releasing them
Along the way.
Pride was the battle we fought
Until we opened our eyes
To the Light of that day
The past towered before us,
But we could see the top of the trail.
So we climbed with strength we're not born with
And we were rising...
We stood on that mountain,
We turned to the sky.
With trembling inside,
We lifted our eyes
And pulling us higher...
Was something Divine
That gave us that time
On the Divide.
It was something Divine
That gave us that time
On the Divide.
So we turned from our view at the top
With a vision so clear
And the sun in our face.
And back to the valley we walked
Knowing everything good
Has its time and its place.
New life was burning inside us
Still it hurt turning to home.
But the same Spirit would guide us
That we had seen when...
We stood on that mountain,
We turned to the sky.
With trembling inside,
We lifted our eyes
And pulling us higher...
Was something Divine
That gave us that time
On the Divide.
It was something Divine
That gave us that time
On the Divide.<start>I've widowed every woman from the waitress to the queen

You got premonitions, talked to spirits, they approved
That just might mean you're lying or them spirits lied to you
Nothing more is perfect, yeah, but nothing less will do
I ain't in your crystal ball
You looked at what the light shined on not where it's shining from, didn't you?
You find what you need only when you need to find it Yeah, I did it too
I knew I was alive cause I used to want to die but not anymore
Now I'm trying to be but old hearts won't let me sleep I hear them in the floor
Standing at the altar with your leather jacket on
Fucked up on some new pills, got you feeling twenty-one
My friends are always pissed off, all your friends dance just for fun
I ain't in your crystal ball
I won't be here for that hangover but I'll come running to raise a glass
Where'd I get my nerve? Oh I thought you'd never ask
We clean the slate just to write mistakes, an old flame you can't blowout

Oh now you've got to put me down
Oh yeah you've got to put me down
Oh now you've got to put me down<start>Sono intorno a noi, in mezzo a noi, in molti casi siamo noi
A far promesse senza mantenerle mai se non per calcolo
Il fine Ã¨ solo l'utile, il mezzo ogni possibile
La posta in gioco Ã¨ massima, l'imperativo Ã¨ vincere
E non far partecipare nessun altro
Nella logica del gioco la sola regola Ã¨ esser scaltro
Niente scrupoli o rispetto verso I propri simili
PerchÃ© gli ultimi saranno gli ultimi se I primi sono irraggiungibili
Sono tanti, arroganti coi piÃ¹ deboli,
zerbini coi potenti, sono replicanti,
Sono tutti identici, guardali,
stanno dietro a maschere e non li puoi distinguere.
Come lucertole s'arrampicano,
e se poi perdon la coda la ricomprano.
Fanno quel che vogliono si sappia in giro fanno
spendono, spandono e sono quel che hanno
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio
e come le supposte abitano in blisters full-optional,
Con cani oltre I 120 decibel e nani manco fosse Disneyland,
Vivono col timore di poter sembrare poveri
Quel che hanno ostentano, tutto il resto invidiano, poi lo comprano,
In costante escalation col vicino costruiscono
Parton dal pratino e vanno fino in cielo,
han piÃ¹ parabole sul tetto che S.Marco nel Vangelo..
Sono quelli che di sabato lavano automobili
che alla sera sfrecciano tra l'asfalto e I pargoli,
Medi come I ceti cui appartengono,
terra-terra come I missili cui assomigliano.
Tiratissimi, s'infarinano, s'alcolizzano
e poi s'impastano su un albero
Nasi bianchi come Fruit of the Loom
che diventano piÃ¹ rossi d'un livello di Doom
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio
Ognun per se, Dio per se, mani che si stringono tra I banchi delle chiese alla domenica
mani ipocrite, mani che fan cose che non si raccontano
Altrimenti le altre mani chissÃ  cosa pensano, si scandalizzano
Mani che poi firman petizioni per lo sgombero,
Mani lisce come olio di ricino,
Mani che brandisco Manganelli, che Farciscono Gioielli,
che si alzano alle spalle dei Fratelli.
Quelli che la notte non si puÃ² girare piÃ¹,
quelli che vanno a mignotte mentre I figli guardan La TV,
Che fanno I boss, che compra Class,
che son sofisticati da chiamare I NAS, incubi di Plastica
Che vorrebbero dar fuoco ad ogni zingara
Ma l'unica che accendono Ã¨ quella che da loro l'elemosina ogni sera,
Quando mi nascondo sulla faccia oscura della loro luna nera
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio

You took me(Don't you do it, don't you do it), ohh, higher and higher, baby
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose<start>Whatever it is you need
Better take what you can to feed it
In a world of hunger and greed
Lives a heart that's truly bleedin'
Now the question of me and you is just remainin' a mystery
I guess it just goes to prove that you never really did love me
So you might just ask your mama
If that's the way it should be
Well, you might just ask your conscience
If I left you or you left me
Well, you say that you want somebody
Who's gonna treat you like a queen
When you don't even have the time of day
For the things that mean a lot to me
I hoped that we'd piece it together
And put an end to the misery
But these things take forever
And it never did occur to me
That you might go home to mama
And that's the way it'd be
Well, you might just ask your conscience
If I left you where you left me
You left me dancin' by myself, dancin' by myself
And I can't find no one else
Can't find no one else
You left me dancin' by myself, dancin' by myself
And I don't want no one else, yeah
Dancin', dancin'
So you might just ask your mama
If that's the way it should be
You might just ask your conscience
If I left you where you left me
You left me dancin' by myself, dancin' by myself
And I can't find no one else
Can't find no one else
You left me dancin' by myself, dancin' by myself
And I don't want no one else dancin'
And I can't find no one
Can't find no one else<start>A hungry feeling
Came o'er me stealing
And the mice were squealing
In my prison cell
And that auld triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
Oh! To start the morning
The warden bawling
"Get up out of bed, you! And Clean out your cell!"
And that auld triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
Oh! the screw was peeping
And the like was sleeping
As he lay weeping
For his girl Sal
And that auld triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
On a fine Spring evening
The like lay dreaming
And the sea-gulls were wheeling
High above the wall
And that auld triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
Oh! the wind was sighing
And the day was dying
As the like lay crying
In his prison cell
And that auld triangle went jingle-bloody-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
In the women's prison
There are seventy women
And I wish it was with them
That I did dwell
Then that auld triangle could go jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal<start>I'll let you in on a little secret
I think you should know when I let you go,
I knew my friends would turn to foes
they said, "Don't give up, she's good people
stood by your side, nothing' to hide,
and gave you a sense of pride..."
But they won't get through to me
and I see much better now that your gone...
Here's another little secret they won't want to hear
I'm done with living in fear - feelign guilty for being here
They said, "Realize you're only human, born with the sin of man
it's all part of the plan - so repent or be damned!"
I'll let you in on a little secret
I think you all should know
I feel the tension grow
and I think its gonna blow.<start>[Instrumental]<start>Well, there was this movie I seen one time
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck
Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
As the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath
Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain
You know I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart
The memory of you keeps callin' after me like a rollin' train
I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel
Well, we drove that car all night into San Anton'
And we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back
I would have gone on after you but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off
Well, we're drivin' this car and the sun is comin' up over the Rockies
Now I know she ain't you but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
To remember the times when I was your only man
And she don't want to remind me, she knows this car would go out of control
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world
Brownsville girl, you're my honey love
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live
He owned a wreckin' lot outside of town about a mile
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust
She said, Henry ain't here but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while
Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin' of
Bummin' a ride back to where she started
But she changed the subject every time money came up
She said, welcome to the land of the living dead
You could tell she was so broken-hearted
She said, even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt
How far are y'all going, Ruby asked us with a sigh
We're going all the way 'til the wheels fall off and burn
'Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies
Ruby just smiled and said, ah, you know some babies never learn
Something about that movie though, well I just can't get it out of my head
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play
All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved
And a lot of them seemed to be lookin' my way
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world
Brownsville girl, you're my honey love
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour
I was crossin' the street when shots rang out
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran
We got him cornered in the churchyard, I heard somebody shout
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune
Underneath it, it said, a man with no alibi
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you
Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears
It was the best acting I saw anybody do
Now I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line
Oh if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't sayin' much
I could feel a whole lot better
If you were just here by my side to show me how
Well, I'm standin' in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck
Yeah, but you know it's not the one that I had in mind
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about
But I'll see him in anything so I'll stand in line
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world
Brownsville girl, you're my honey love
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter
And you know there was somethin' about you baby
That I liked that was always too good for this world
Just like you always said there was something about me you liked
That I left behind in the French Quarter
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
Than people who are most content
I don't have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone
You always said people don't do what they believe in
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent
And I always said, hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on
There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world
Brownsville girl, you're my honey love
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world
Brownsville girl, you're my honey love
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above<start>Despite that he saw blatant similarity
He struggled to find a distinctive moiety
All he found was vulgar superficiality
But he focused it to sharpness
And shared it with the others
It signified his anger and misery
Them and us
Lobbying determined through a mire of disbelievers
Them and us
Dire perpetuation and incongruous insistence
That there really is a difference
Between them and us
Hate is a simple manifestation
Of the deep-seated self-directed frustration
All it does is promote fear and consternation
It's the inability
To justify the enemy
And it fills us all with trepidation
Them and us
Bending the significance to match a whimsied fable
Them and us
Tumult for the ignorant and purpose for the violence
A confused loose alliance forming
Them and us<start>There's an answer on everybody's lips
But will it provide questions?
Forget these not, the words that I speak to you
I've found the tools to end time
Will it find you?
Lost in time
Will it find you?
Forever changing face
Will it find you?
Will you ever change this place?
Friendly faces, concealing cell corruption
Never-ending chase after your own salvation
Destroying minds around you while you're keeping me sane
What's left but this blindness to this cross I bear
Will it find you?
Lost in time
Will it find you?
Forever changing face
Will it find you?
Will you ever change this place?<start>We were watchin' tv...watchin'tv
We were watchin' tv...watchin'tv
In tiananmen square
Lost my baby there
My yellow rose
And her bloodstained clothes
She was a short order pastry chef
In a dim sum dive on the yangtze tideway
She had shiny hair
She was the daughter of an engineer
Won't you shed a tear
For my yellow rose
My yellow rose
And her bloodstained clothes
She had perfect breasts
She had high hopes
She had almond eyes
She had yellow thighs
She was a student of philosophy
Won't you grieve with me
For my yellow rose
Shed a tear
For her bloodstained clothes
She had shiny hair
She had perfect breasts
She had high hopes
She had almond eyes
She had yellow thighs
She was the daughter of an engineer
So get out your pistols
Get out your stones
Get out your knives
Cut them to the bone
They are the lackeys of the grocer's machine
They built the dark satanic mills
That manufacture hell on earth
They bought the front row seats on calvary
They are irrelevant to me
And I grieve for my sister
People of china
Do not forget do not forget
The children who died for you
Long live the republic
Did we do anything after this
I've a feeling we did
We were watchin' tv...watchin' tv
We were watchin' tv...watchin' tv
She wore a white bandanna that said
Freedom now
She thought the great wall of china
Would come tumbling down
She was a student
Her father was an engineer
Won't you shed a tear
For my yellow rose
My yellow rose
And her bloodstained clothes
Her grandpa fought old chiang kai-shek
That no-good low-down dirty rat
Who used to order his troops
To fire on the women and children
Imagine that imagine that
And in the spring of '48
Mao tse-tung got quite irate
And he kicked that old dictator chiang
Out of the state of china
Chiang kai-shek came down in formosa
And they armed the island of quemoy
And the shells were flying across the china sea
And they turned formosa into a shoe factory
Called taiwan
And she is different from cro-magnon man
She's different from anne boleyn
She is different from the rosenbergs
And from the unknown jew
She is different from the unknown nicaraguan
Half superstar half victim
She's a victor star conceptually new
And she is different from the dodo
And from the kankanbono
She is different from the aztec
And from the cherokee
She's everybody's sister
She's symbolic of our failure
She's the one in fifty million
Who can help us to be free
Because she died on tv<start>(J. Comanor/S. Silverstein)
Sal from the valley loved Al from the alley and they lived in harmony
Sally played acoustic and Al, he played electric and they both took turns on lead
They sang it for their friends, again and again of the places they had been
But their favourite song of all was called up on the mountain
Up on the mountain, up where the light breaks, that's where you'll find me
Gonna leave this worrisome world and it's trouble behind me
Up on the mountain, where the light breaks, that's where I'll be
I've barely got time to finish this song so say farewell for me
Then into the valley came a girl from the galleys, with a strange and smilin' face
Al played acoustic and Sally played electric, and the gal played a hell of a bass
And when they sang their harmonies, the lady dipped right in
She soon moved in and lived with them up on the mountain
Up on the mountain, up where the light breaks, that's where you'll find me
Gonna leave this worrisome world and it's trouble behind me
Up on the mountain, where the light breaks, that's where I'll be
I've barely got time to finish this song so say farewell for me
Now Al from the alley is gone from the valley, a sadder but wiser man
And Sally from the valley and the gal from the galleys they live in mortal sin
Sal plays acoustic and the gal plays electric and sometimes they hold hands
Late at night you can hear them playing, up on the mountain
Up on the mountain, up where the light breaks, that's where you'll find me
Gonna leave this worrisome world and it's trouble behind me
Up on the mountain, where the light breaks, that's where I'll be
I've barely got time to finish this song so say farewell for me
Hot lickin' and finger pickin'
Say farewell for me

It must be four in a row
I gotta get my head down tonight
But you know I know
When the streets are aglow
I'll be heading for the city of light
You talkin' to me?
'cause I don't want to know-no-no-no
You can't even see
What's already on show-oh-oh-oh
I'm hitting my prime
And you're wasting my time
You're denominator commonest low
My head's burning up
And I'm down on my luck
See you in the 48th row
With a matchbox full
And a sulphurous skull
Trying to set my mind to rights
I'm gonna burn, burn, burn,
As the universe turns
Out of mind and out of sight
You talkin' to me?
'cause I don't want to know-no-no-no
You can't even see
What's already on show-oh-oh-oh

Lost his will to live

You can't even see

(Matt Coban)
And you don't know what tomorrow holds
Can't believe we sold our souls that blind
It just takes a little time
To take back what they said to you
And make up for all the things they knew but lied
How could this be right?
And everything was beautiful
Till you knocked down all the walls in my mind
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Just take it from my hands
And put it in someone else's
No one around here will realize what they found
And I still believe I'm thinking too much of myself
No one knows there way around here
I've been there, done that, dried the tears, still I hide
So why is it your fine?
You gave my life a change of pace
Though everything could use some change, I'm alive
But you've taken all that's mine
And everything was beautiful
Till you knocked down all the walls in my mind
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Just take it from my hands
And put it in someone else's
No one around here will realize what they found
And I still believe I'm thinking too much of myself
And I still believe, I'm thinking too much of myself<start>Windows of love
Rely on power of sunshine.
With these eyes you see
The world in broken hearts and lies unwind.
All the years I'm looking for
The truth of love that no one saw.
Windows, windows
Windows of love.
Panes of glass keep you from me
As I look inside for what I need.
Free your mind and turn the key
Unlock the future to let it be.
Windows, windows
Windows of love.<start>We were talking in a field
Feet on the ground
Though my memories often fade there
Oceans apart from where you are
Comedy all opions tied
Raise your arms and we'll lift up this sky holding stars
Carry away there to your surprise
The moment is eternal if you think you want it
Moments arise
Comedy all opinions tied
Raise your arms and we'll lift up this sky holding stars
Carry away there to your surprise
Comedy our opinions tied
Raise your arms and we'll lift up this sky holding scars<start>I've been thinking now for a long time
How to go my own separate way
It's a shame to think about yesterday a shame
We've been running round in our present state
Hoping help would come from above
But even angels there make the same mistakes in love
Now that we are lonely
Life seems to get hard
Alone what a word lonely
Alone it makes me cry
Thought-train set in motion
Wheels in and around
Express our emotion
Tracks up then it cracks down<start>(dick dale)
Instrumental<start>It's very clear our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies, and in time may go
But, oh my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay
But, oh my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay
Our love is here to stay<start>Your kiss was a perfect drug
It gave me the perfect high
How can cheaters fall in love
They all deserve to die
I need to feel you again
I need your lips on my skin
For one night I could be him
Well I could be better
In your eyes I thought I saw tomorrow
Now all I see is wasted time
Can we pretend it's always been OK
We never lost it all, lost it all
Can we pretend we never left this fate
We never lost it all, lost it all
This towns not much of a friend
After twenty-three days
My patience has reached it's end
But I'd take you back anyway
Hold your breath
You make the perfect sounds
This is what a love is made of
And baby you are missing out
In your eyes I thought I saw tomorrow
Now all I see is wasted time
Can we pretend it's always been OK
We never lost it all, lost it all
Can we pretend we never left this fate
We never lost it all, lost it all
Let's reintroduce our shadows
And watch them become one
This room is out of oxygen
And I'm not nearly done
The familiar shape of your body
Is how I know this is right
I'm not asking for tomorrow
I'm just asking for tonight
Can we pretend it's always been OK
We never lost it all, lost it all
Can we pretend we never left this fate
We never lost it all, lost it all
The familiar shape of your body
Is how I know this is right
Why worry about tomorrow<start>Eyes are, open words are spoken
Here's to the sunrise
Head is loaded cards are folded
Under the moonlight
Can you remember, you remember the last time
We woke up sober?
Can you remember, you remember the last night
You ran me over?
Are we halfway gone or halfway there?
Left alone
We're only halfway home
Sink like stones
Fall into the unknown
Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder
Mind is open, thoughts are woken
There goes the sunrise
Heart is broken, love unspoken
Here comes the moonlight
Can you remember, you remember the last time
I left hungover?
Can you remember, you remember the last night
That I stayed over?
Are we halfway gone or halfway there?
Left alone
We're only halfway home
Sink like stones
Fall into the unknown
Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder

It's not even the cold nor the pains or aches
I can cope with blisters and the weight of my pack
And I don't mind the rain if I've got my mac
But have I cursed Wainwright in my time
To be fair, he said it's all muck and slime
The creeping sludge, the never-ending peat
It were that that nearly finished me, it nearly had me beat
Peat bogs, peat bogs, more peat bogs
You'd never credit it--they burn the stuff instead of logs
Peat bogs, peat bogs, more peat bogs
Well it's such a funny stuff is peat, it's nature's own glue
It got to me, it did, and by the end of day, too
I thought, I'm only carrying on so that I can say
If I've done nothing else, I've walked the Penine way
But I did it seven years ago, so why do it again?
Well I don't really know, and I didn't know then
Unless it's this that's been nagging at my noggin
Peat bogs and me have got this love/hate thing
Peat bogs, peat bogs, more peat bogs
You'd never credit it--they burn the stuff instead of logs
Peat bogs, peat bogs, more peat bogs<start>We both agree we shouldn't be so much in love this way
Although it's wrong, we go along, just lovin' more each day
We act so proud out in the crowd, while another wears my name

We've opened up a patience we can't fight
And closed our eyes to everything that's right
She won't agree to set me free, still we get all the blame
We've opened up our hearts to love and closed our eyes to shame
We've opened up a patience we can't fight
And closed our eyes to everything that's right
We're victims of forbidden love, we play a losin' game

Allow me to be your sponge
'Cause I can absorb your sorrows
I'm the one
Fire may rain down on you but I'll be your water
Waves may crash on you but I'll be your land
'Cause I want to give you just a temporary bliss
Just a little bit, just a little bit
A little more information
To add to my confusion, to add to the frustration
I don't need it
So shed your pain, well, I'll sit in silence
As you bleed your deepest feelings here
Quakes may rattle you but I'll be your sky
Winds may twist around you but I'll be your clouds
Just a little bit, just a little bit
A little more information
To add to my confusion, to add to the frustration
I don't need it, no, I don't need it
He woke up next to her, his head against her head
His hand upon her breast, he knew today meant death
He kissed her on the cheek and then on her lips
Thought to himself, "It's the last time I'll do this"
Put on a suit, pressed and clean
Then brushed his hair, grabbed his keys
Then he headed out to the morning air
With an anticipation no man could bear
The air was heavy, he could feel it in his lungs
With every step he took
A prayer rolled off his tongue
They were prayers of forgiveness
And prayers of praise
And his actions a gift for a god without a name
Just a little bit, just a little bit
A little more information
To add to my confusion, to add to the frustration
I don't need it, no, I don't need it<start>Tonight I went to a punk rock show
The band was really good and the lights were all low

Gimme gimme gimme one sweet punk rock chick
Yeah one of these days I'll make one mine all mine
To the one on the left I said, "How do you do?"
She showed me her ring and said, "Toodaloo"
To the one on the right I said, "What do you know?"
But I had to leave because of her b.o.
Tonight I'm gonna get me one sweet punk rock girl

Slippin' into the car to stay warm

We've got a mind of our own
So go to hell if what you're thinking is not right
Love would never leave us alone
A-yin the darkness there must come out to light
Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, wo now, and be loved?
(The road of life is rocky and you may stumble too
So while you point your fingers someone else is judging you)
Love your brotherman
(Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be loved?)
Don't let them change ya, oh
Or even rearrange ya, oh, no
We've got a life to live
They say, only, only
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive
Stay alive, eh
Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, wo now, and be loved?
(You ain't gonna miss your water until your well runs dry
No matter how you treat him, the man will never be satisfied)
Say something! (could you be, could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be loved)
Say something say something (could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something (could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something say something (say something)

Say something reggae, reggae
Say something rockers, rockers

Someone talked and someone heard
The twisted end to all the words
That I'd hung on to
One more time inside the dream
Where nothing has to be this real
And I don't ever care to feel
What I don't want to
You once said I thought too much
But never thought enough to touch
Eyes so sad evergreen
The saddest eyes I've ever seen
Lost all reason and belonging
Can't do right for doing wrong and
I don't like the way I'm feeling
Need your faith healing
Healing healing healing
Faith and healing
Faith and healing
Faith and healing
Pick me up and hold me there
Leave me hanging in the air
Till I promise I will care
The way I used to
Diamonds in the pool tonight
Reminds me of what nights were like
Before I feel into a life
That I got used to
The shining sea the silver sky
A perfect world before my eyes
Don't be scared don't you cry
If all the world goes passing by
Lost all reason and belonging
Can't do right for doing wrong and
I don't like the way I'm feeling
Need your faith healing
Healing healing healing
Faith and healing

You once said I thought too much
But never thought enough to touch
Lost all reason and belonging

With the last light of the sun
The day is almost over
The day is almost done
Perhaps tonight I'll sit and watch
The stars come out
Their liquid hazy light
Holding time still
Bringing old memories to life
But I'm restless, restless, so restless
Time seemed to move slover then
My father worked so hard
I hardly knew his hand
My mother so much younger
Tried to make me understand
That was before the bad times
The house on the hill
That's when I wished
For just a little longer
Time could stand still
And I was restless, so restless
Too damn restless, restless
Life has tested my faith
I've wandered from the path
But things I'm ashamed of
No-one's perfect that's a fact
Sometimes I've found myself
Walking in the footsteps of the beast
I've done things that are not like me in the least
They have been even in bad times
Fragments of eden things were gold
Glimpsed never forgotten even though
I'm still restless, I'm still restless
So damn restless, so damn restless
So damn restless, so damn restless
Restless, restless, restless
Restless, I'm restless, too damn restless
I'm so restless<start>A red priest broke into our classroom
Caught us children by attention
Listen closely to the words I speak
Lord knows if we'll ever, ever again meet
Spoke such words never spoken before
On the way he declared the war
Miracles like you've never seen
From a man who was raised up in the sea
A man is coming in thirteen one
To charm the daughters and the sons
Scared for our lives I turn your hands
Hold this tight while we run if we still can
What disasters may come, whatever it may be
At the end of the age it will land you and me
What tragedy may bring, what ever may fall
At the end of the world you'll still belong
Before the red priest took his last breath
He told me child now don't forget
The sun will turn dark very soon
Your days are numbered when there's blood on the moon
The earth will shake and the sky will fall
The eyes will open of those enthralled
Don't take the sign, but you'll be killed
By the man from seven hills
A man is coming in thirteen one
To charm the daughters and the sons
Scared for our lives I turn your hands
Hold this tight while we run if we still can
What disasters may come, whatever it may be
At the end of the age it will land you and me
What tragedy may bring, what ever may fall
At the end of the world you'll still belong
Look children to the eastern sky
When you hear the voice say your last goodbye
Look there to the eastern skies
When the ghosts take hold of the men who've died
Look children to the eastern sky
When your fathers weep and your mothers cry
Look children to the eastern sky<start>I feel strangely cold and nervous again my friend
And its time, this conversation ends
I weigh, my will agaist the steel
In the palm of my hand
And it loods like (you'll see) my reality
And it looks like (you'll feel) the pain
Oh, save my soul
Save my soul
Did you take me for a foul my friend?
Think that you'd be laughin?
I don't ever forgive
I don't ever forgive
Chorus:
And it looks like (you'll see) my reality
And it looks like (you'll feel) the pain
Blood in, Blood in, Blood in, Blood in the river
Blood in, Blood in, Blood in, Blood in the river
Oh save my soul, save my soul
Oh save my soul, save my soul

I'm not here to be free
In this broken society
Currupt and empty
You made me
You made me

i'm an ex-spectator never let me, never let my, never let my vision get in the way of

can an observer be a participant?

We had a little kind of thing going on
A touch and a kiss, a wink and a smile
These stolen moments linger long, after you're gone
But lately I've been wondering, where do I stand
If I figure in your future
'Cos the spell you've put me under, means I'm going nowhere
Until I know your answer
That's why I'm layin' it on the line
Won't you tell me if you'll be mine
Said I'm layin' it on the line
Do you want me to stay, or do I walk away
If you say so, I'll be your hear and now
I swear we'd never part
But if you say no, don't let me down gently
I need to make a brand new start
I'm losing my handle on the situation
I'm constantly astounded by the life you lead
I image your world is a beautiful place
Can you imagine a place in it for me
I'll let you call the shots, take it or leave it
But I just need some relief
The waiting is killing me, don't leave me hanging on
Or lead me along with some false belief
Higher, higher higher baby
That's why I'm layin' it on the line
Won't you tell me if you'll be mine
Said I'm layin' it, layin' it on the line
Do you want me to stay, or do I walk away
Do I hold you tight, or do we say goodnight
Layin' it, Layin' it
Layin' it, Layin' it
Layin' it, Layin' it (I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta know)
Layin' it, Layin' it, , Layin' it on the line
Layin' it, Layin' it (this time I really got to know)
Layin' it, Layin' it

Not till I've gone away
When you gonna take the blame
Oh, when your love has strayed

When you gonna taste the same
Go and perform again
When you gonna call the game
This is the lost complaint
This is the lost complaint
I just want the focus on you
My photograph won't disappoint you

My troubles she said go way back far before your day
But things are all right
She said it's alright you could see it on her face
Her days of praise had gone astray and moved on to another place my father threw up his arms in a cold aggressive rage I've been fighting my conscience years now every single day we live alone now but no one is to blame his days away go unexplained things will never be the same what's there to pray about? letting go is not so simple what's there to pray about?

I don't remember when
When I fell for myself
I fell off the chair
That sat me next to you
Could I take all the love
That I have for myself
Could I give it all to you
Can I kill the big monster
That lives down inside
Can we throw all the history aside
It's not easy to pretend
That we're not
Enemies sometimes
But it pleases me defending
All the memories tonight
It may have been a bit hopeless
But something honest
Went down that night
I lifted my head for
Just long enough to see
What I'd never seen in my life
Could I take all the love
That I had for myself
Did anything make it through
And it kills not to know
What goes on in your mind
Can you throw all the history aside
It's not easy to pretend
That we're not
Enemies sometimes

Time to get up and have a drink
Pacific rim has a tank that thinks
That she is really something grand
Let me tell you about
When I was hanging out
Just in my dothi
Running in the dawn
Right across my lawn
I saw a coyote
Ole, ole, ole for Mulholland
See the water fall
And hooray, hooray the sky is falling
Down on Bradbury's mall
Ole, ole, ole for Mulholland
All waxed in pride
I've got a comfortable ride
And man, she could take us
Out across the salts
Right out of these faults
And on into vegas
So slept a monster in the dune
Woke him up and then he drank
Pacific rim has a think tank
But does she have IQ for the moon?
The concrete of the aquaduct
Will last as long as the Pyramids of Egypt
Or the Parthenon of Athens
Long after Joe Harriman is elected Mayor of Los Angeles
Ole, ole, ole for Mulholland
See the water fall
And hooray, hooray the ants are crawling
Down in Bradbury's mall
Ole, ole, ole for Mulholland
Yeah, it's quite a sprawl
And hooray, hooray the sky is falling
Down on Bradbury's mall
Ole, ole, ole for Mulholland
Ole!<start>Lay down my rights

Smile til it hurts

We've got a story
But I'm about to change the ending
You're perfect for me
You're more than just a friend so we can just stop pretending now
I gotta let you know somehow

That we would always stay together
But who's to say
We could never last forever

Could you see yourself with somebody else?
'Cause I'm on a mission

And I can't think of anything but you
And do you feel the same way too?

Like words of passion falling down, it's true
The one's I've never heard from you
Remember, love was such an easy game to play
Those days are flown a million miles away
Everything I want
Everything I do
Is trying to find myself again
'Cause life can be so cruel
For anything I've done
And things that I did wrong
I'm asking to forgive me 'cause it's obvious
I'm guilty of loving you
I'll take the chance, this is my life
I'm gonna make the best of what I am
I really need to understand
And should I fail or recognize
The mirror's not reflecting what I want to see
Someone else inside me
I'm stepping out the edge, I'm on the borderline
Ain't gonna make the same mistakes this time
'Cause everything I want
Everything I do
Is trying to find myself again
'Cause life can be so cruel
For anything I've done
And things that I did wrong
I'm asking to forgive me 'cause it's obvious
I'm guilty of loving you, guilty of loving you
Now everything I want
Everything I do
Is trying to find myself again

For anything I've done
And things that I did wrong
I'm asking to forgive me 'cause it's obvious
It's clear that I was guilty of loving you<start>The best things in life are free

Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free to take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.<start>Lady dressed in gold
She is young, she is old
She's the keeper of the soul
She's called death
Takes you in her arms
Like a child to a mother
She's your sister, she's your borther
She is death
She's knocking at your door
Don't have to run no more
This day I knew was coming
Wasted all my years with all of my fears
And everything didn't mean nothing
Lady dressed in gold
She is young, she is old
She's the keeper of the soul
She's called death
Takes you in her arms
Like a child to a mother
She's your sister, she's your borther
She is death
There's no use in fighting
Doesn't matter if you're hiding
Cause she is there when there's nothing left
Only longs for your last breath
She's in me and she's in you
She is waiting for that kiss that will let you go
Lady dressed in gold
She is young, she is old
She's the keeper of the soul
She's called death
Takes you in her arms
Like a child to a mother
She's your sister, she's your borther

Didn't you know?
Cause everybody knows it
When the time comes
The lady comes for you
To take you home
Cause everybody knows it
When the time comes
The lady comes for you
Oh, didn't you know?
She's keeping score

She's getting more

She's dressed in gold

About the things sent to make you move
You can't help it, there's no one in the world
Knows you just, just the way you do
So we keep darting through the holes
As the hunter and the fox
Run the gauntlet's savage road
Winter's heavy and partly cloudy
And the snowfall leaves the tracks that catch a few
Bit if you're wiley, you will leave them lying
Snared up in the traps that they set for you
And it's an evergreen affair
As temptation taunts the fox
Into the hunter's waiting lair
And for mile after mile you'll never see me tire
You'll never see me slow down, for a while
Cause I am the fox, like it or not
I'm always gonna be there running over the rock
Yes I am the fox, a fascinating cross
Of sharp as a whip and tough as an ox
Yes I am the fox
It may sound crazy but it's often lonely
And the restless heart should be captured once in a while
Then you can use them, and you often fool them
Into believing whatever you desire
So I'll keep moving through the night
The hunter and the hunted
On their designated flights<start>Sorry, did I startle you?
My face was to the mirror
Broken wings are lovely things
If they can lead you nearer
In ever cloud, there is some silver
Every shadow comes from light, yeah
Something takes my hands and makes
The wrong in me all right
Shinging one, you're the sun
And i am burning up inside you
Shadows fly on wings of pride
And if I follow, I will find you
Silent one, on my own
I whisper to you
"I remember"
My eclipse is on your lips
And finger tips
Until December ends...
Until December ends
Even though I know my name
I know myself inside you
People loathe December snow
But they don't need you, I do
Crimson women misbehave
And I reap the consequences
Fading to the jade in you
And surrender my defenses...
Shining one, you're the sun
And I am burning up inside you...
And I say...
And I say, yeah...
Shining one, you're the sun
And I am burning up inside you
Shadows fly on wings of pride
And if I follow, I will find you
Silent one, on my own
I whisper to you
"I remember"
My eclipse is on your lips
And finger tips
Until December ends...
Until December ends<start>Penniless and tired, let your hair grow long
I was looking at you there and your face looked wrong
Memory is an echo silent song
I didn't understand
Image and a light as the morning nears
you don't say a single word of your last two years
Well you will be, you'll reach the frontier
I didn't understand, oh
See your wringing hands and a silver knife
Twenty dollars in your hand that you hold so tight
All the evidence of your vegan lie
My brother you were born
And you will try to do what you did before
Pull the wool over your eyes
Put a week or more
Let your family take you back to your original mind<start>By Woody Guthrie

Wow wow wow<start>My thoughts are commodities
My lies are me
My price is a compromise
My pay is peace
And words just make it worse
They're misunderstood
See just like there
If you can't spell it out
If it's just understood
Then you think it isn't there I make my mind up
Convince my brain
I lie on accident
Trying to explain
But all the things that I was told
All the people that told me
How can I not believe in things that
Everyone else sees<start>Be, I want to be
Just like you, what you do I want too
Bleed, I'm gonna bleed
To belong I would give all you need
I would give my life to get some rest
But I'll do anything that Simon says
"Throw your hands in the air
Wave 'em around like you just don't care"
Reap, I want to reap
Everything that you sow I will keep
Creep, I'm gonna creep
And I'll do it again and again and again
I would give my life to get some rest
But I'll do anything that Simon says
"Throw your hands in the air
Wave 'em around like you just don't care"<start>As I walked down the street
Seems everyone I meet
Gives me a friendly Hello!
Guess I'm just a lucky so and so
Birds in every tree
Seem all so near to me
They sing wherever I go
Guess I'm just a lucky so and so
[Chorus]
If you should ask me the amount
In my bank account
I would have to confess
That I'm slipping
But, that don't worry me
Confidentially, I got a dream that I'm tip in
And when the days through
Each night, I hurry to
Home where love ways I know
Guess, I'm just a lucky so and so
[Chorus]
And when the days through
Each night, I hurry to
Home where love ways I know
Guess, I'm just a lucky so and so
Woo!
Just a lucky so and so.<start>Ride with the night, shoot for the stars
Stop for the red light who do you think you are?
We'll try to beast through the trigger, channel that fire
Burn baby burn as the heat blaze the tires
Now breathe the fumes of exhaust, you think I'm tired?
I can drive all night, I'll show you what's under the cover
Try to push it to the limit, climbing higher in the digits
There 'aint nobody that can stop us, we'll explore your favorite places
We'll drive all night long
Let's go baby
I can take you for a joy ride, watch the mileage meter rise
Are you ready?
I can show you every way I can cruise and it goes something like this
Let me take you on the open road, teach you some tricks that go something like this
Midnight ride, calm of the night
Shake it all up as we fly on by
We'll try to chase the rush, reach that high
Roll the windows now watch the sparks ignite
Addicted to the thrills, accelerate the breath
As we shift in gears from one to the next
Try to push it to the limit, climbing higher in the digits
There 'aint nobody that can stop us, we'll explore your favorite places
We'll drive all night long
Let's go baby
I can take you for a joy ride, watch the mileage meter rise
Are you ready?
I can show you every way I can cruise and it goes something like this
Let me take you on the open road, teach you some tricks that go something like this<start>I can see
You're slipping away from me
And you're so afraid
That I'll plead with you to stay
But I'm gonna be strong
And let you go your way
Love is gone
There's no sense in holding on
And your pity now
Would be more than I could bare
But I'm gonna be strong
And pretend I don't care
I'm gonna be strong
And stand as tall as I can
I'm gonna be strong
And let you go along
And take it like a man
When you say it's the end
I'll hand you a line
I'll smile and say
Don't you worry I'm fine
But you'll never know darling
After you kiss me goodbye
How I'll break down and cry<start>High above as in the clouds
They swing so slowly
To the wire showing no fear
They step so boldly
Gently faster
Building in momentum
Until success or disaster
Befalls the master
Of the tightrope walk
The dizzying heights
The sound of your hearts
Like thunder
Measure your step
Or all your plans
May fall asunder
Now gently faster
Building in momentum
Until success or disaster
Befalls the master
Of the tightrope walk
The safety net is your psyche
The wire though imaginary
Yes its very real
So tread with care
On the tightrope walk
The tightrope walk
The tightrope walk
The tightrope walk<start>That's the holiday
That's the hanukkah robot funk
(Ba-rum-pa-pum-pum uh.)
Right about now
Gonna drop some hanukkah science
Yeah, hmm, uh--this is it
I press a button make the gentleman cry
I rock a beat to make the hamburger fry
I funk this joint and check out holiday gear
The system booming strictly pioneer
Under the rear
Bringing a tear
I turn it out in a holiday mode
Safe like a seatbelt in a volvo
Keeping it real like a spray-snow tree
We'll shut it down harmoniously
Rockin' softly
808 Beats
I get this shit lit like a menorah
Funk so illegal I think I might need a lawyer
Not a firestarter but my beats get hotter
Even amount like an allowance
Footwear riot new balance
Hanukkah pimp on a check
Like a micro rock gettin' in a sweat
Neal's mackin' track
Ejaculatin' on buffet tables and record labels
Willin' and able
Bring my funk in place of each beat
Lifestyles of the slick and sleazy
Spin around and around like a dreidel
Kind of science that puts you back in the cradle
Shit, sometimes this track's so poignant
Somebody please pass me some kind of ointment
Put these rhymes together like a thief
Clear up your nose like a eucalyptus leaf
Dropping science, you don't even know what hits you
Next thing you know you're 13 and get a bar mitzvah
I get down, I get down, I get down all the way
Yeah yeah yeah yeah ooohhhhhh
I get down, I get down, I get down all the way, etc
Hanukkah pimp
Pimpin'<start>I can feel it, I can feel it,

You looked but turned away
Walkaway, walkaway
If you've said all you got to say
And now the words just slip away
Just walkaway, walkaway, walkaway
That's what they say, what they say,

You gotta walkaway
If you've played all the games they play
You played them yesterday
Walkaway, walkaway
If you've been, where they want to go
Seen all they got to show
Just walkaway, walkaway, walkaway
That's what they say, what they say,

You gotta walkaway
And now you must believe me
You never lose your dreams
And now you must believe me
We never lose our dreams
If you've proved all there is to prove
Got nothing left to use
Walkaway, walkaway
If you've done, all there is to do
There ain't nothing left for you
Just walkaway, walkaway, walkaway
That's what they say, what they say,

Today<start>[Anneke van Giersbergen]:
(No need...)
No need to feel the pain
No need to feel betrayed
No need to feel inane
No need to feel afraid
[Jorn Lande]:
Wake me up before I die, hold me close
As I gaze upon the sky, comatose
No reason to survive, I suppose
Wake us up before we die
[Anneke & Jorn]:
No need to feel desire
(but I need you with me)
No need to feel so small
(but I need to feel secure)
No need to feel the fire
(but I need to feel free)
No need to feel at all
(but I need to know for sure)
[Jorn]:
Wake me up before I die, hold me close
As I gaze upon the sky, comatose
No reason to survive, I suppose
Wake us up before we die (x2)<start>Original musician: ray charles
Hit the road, jack
And don't you come back
No more no more no more no more
Hit the road, jack
And don't you come back
No more<start>Chorus:
New York City girl
Born and raised in South Queens
She goes to work in taxi cabs
Comes back home in limousines
Well if you see her tell her I'm alright
I know the reason why she couldn't stay
My New York City girl
I wouldn't have it any other way
I guess I should've saw it comin'
She gave me every single warning
Instead I stumbled headlong into
Somewhere I'd never be returnin'
She wouldn't let me hold her
She let her hair fall on her shoulder
And I didn't tell her one damn thing
A million others haven't told her
Repeat Chorus
I told her that I'd miss her
She wouldn't even let me kiss her
She just gathered up her things
Fixed her hair and took the money from the dresser
Repeat Chorus<start>Yeah it's a snow white original mix and she's fixing me
And the heartless thing she does is everything I love
It's all I ever need
Yeah it's a skin tight sensational strip and she's tripping me
And the shameless way she turns...
Is all I ever dream
You ask me why I use it
It could be just a way to pass the time
I never really choose it
It's just another play to lose...
My mind...
Yeah it's a bright light promotional taste and she's wasting me
And the tearless time she breaks is everytime I ache
It's all I ever feel
You ask me why I need it
It's maybe just a way to pass the time
I never really mean it
It's just another play to lose...
My mind...
Yeah it's a big night emotional kill and she's thrilling me
And the careless way she hurts...
Is all I ever scream
You ask me why I take it
It could be just a way to pass the time
I never really make it
It's just another play to lose...
I'm coming up in the dark
And every part of me is bruised and raw and pained
I'm coming up in the dark
And every part of me is loose and sore and stained
And so I play it when I use it if I need it then I take it
And I play it all again...
And then I hold you... so cold you... like I know you...
Yeah like I always know and like I always lose...
My mind... my mind...
Yeah I play it when I use it if I need it then I take it
And I play it all again... and then I hold you... so cold you...
Like I know you...
Yeah like I always know and like I always lose
Yeah like I always lose
Like I always lose...

We died your way<start>Ain't it funny how a woman can change a man overnight?
From a natural born rebel to a born-again-kinda-guy.
All it took was one look in your eyes; now...
[Chorus]
I'm a new man walkin'; you can write it in stone.
You made me a believer once and for all.
Well, I used to be honky-tonk trouble;
I'm leavin' those days behind me on the double.
With an angel like you in my corner,
I'm tradin runnin' on whiskey for walkin' on water.
(Runnin' on whiskey; walkin' on water.)
I used to set 'em up, drink 'em down, make my rounds going strong.
Makin' noise with the boys, gettin' wild past the break of dawn;
Now those rip and roarin' days are gone.
[Chorus]
All those party friends of mine
Say I'm mighty hard to find these days.
Well, that might be true, but it's all because of you.
I've learned to live it up a better way, right beside you.
[Chorus]
Tradin runnin' on whiskey for walkin' on water.
(Runnin' on whiskey; walkin' on water.)
Walkin' on water.
(Runnin' on whiskey; walkin' on water.)<start>(Verse)
In the darkness of my nights
A little spark begun to shine
Woke up and I realized
Imperfection is divine
(Pre-Chorus)
So this creepy heart of mine
That is tip toeing on the line
I know we will be just fine
And I know why..
(Chorus)
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well that's nothing (new new...)
Well that's nothing (new new...)
(Verse)
In a world so black and white
I'm blazing up my mind
Woke up and I realized
Imperfection is divine
(Pre-Chorus)
In this creepy heart of mine
Let's keep going on the line
I know we will be just fine
And I believe I...
(Chorus)
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well that's not fair! (oh oh...)
Well that's not fair! (oh oh...)
(Chorus x2)
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well that's not fair! (oh oh...)
Well that's not fair! (oh oh...)<start>Not you again, I thought you died
I thought you were killed on your wedding night
Not you again, hypocrite
You've come to ask me to kill you again, is that it?
Not you again, I'm no fool twice
I've heard the wolf tracking in the ice
Peel off the latex, fair-weather friend
Is that supposed to be a nose? No, not you again
Oh, Mary
Don't weep down on me
"I don't need a host to live"
Oh, Mary
I'm just too much to carry
Mary
Not you again, my grandmother's Lord
Another friend like that, I can't afford
California makes me sick
Like trying with a rattlesnake your teeth to pick
Everyone I know gossips endlessly
Everyone I know suffers just like me
Have you come back for your saddle, to squat like a hen?
Why are you even here? No, not you again
Oh, Mary
Don't weep down on me
"I don't need a host to live"
Oh, Mary
I'm just too much to carry
Mary<start>It's been ten years of investment
It's been one foot in and one out
It's been four days of full of shit
And I feel snuffed out
It's been 33 years of restraining
Of trying to control this tumult
How did I invest in such fantasy?
But my nervous system has won out
I feel done
I feel raked over coals
And all that remains is the case
That it's a bitch to grow up
I've repeated this dance, ad nauseam
There's still something to learn that I've not
I totally see, this is divine perfection
But my bones don't feel this perfection
I feel done
I feel raked over coals
And all that remains is the case
That it's a bitch to grow up
I've spent my life hovering above bottom
Thinking I can't survive what's below
But I've known through the kicking and screaming
That there was no other direction to go
I feel done
I feel raked over coals
And all that remains is the case
That it's a bitch to grow up<start>Come, let's stroll
Stroll across the floor
Come, let's stro-oh-oh-oll
Stroll across the floor
Now turn around, baby
Let's stroll once more
Feel so good
Take me by my hand
I feel so goo-ooh-ooh-ood
Take me by my hand
And let's go strolling
In wonderland
Strollin', oh yeah, strollin' ah
Rock and ro-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh-llin'
Strollin'
Well rock my so-oul
How I love to stroll
There's my love
Strolling in the door
There's my lo-o-o-ove
Strolling in the door
Baby, let's go strolling
By the candy store<start>Well I see ya
Holdin' hands with your lover
And you're makin' plans with each other
It fits real good on you
Well don't worry
I didn't come to make things strange
'Cause there's a reason that things change
There's nothin' we can do!
And it's been five long years
Since I've seen your lovely eyes
You girls have grown
She sees right through my thin disguise
You know I still love you
You knew I'd never change
And it's been five long years and I love you
Just the same
When you see me
Do you remember the times when we traveled
South of the borderline when love was young
Time was on our side
We danced
In the Rio Grande
And we listened to all the Mexican bands
Singin' songs of love
When our hearts were young, yeah
And it's been five long years
Since I've seen your lovely eyes
The girls have grown
She sees right through my thin disguise
You know I still love you
You knew I'd never change
And it's been five long years and I love you
Just the same
Oh, yeah
Five long years
Five long years
Five long years
Since I've seen your lovely eyes
Things have changed
You see right through my thin disguise
She sees right through me, yeah!
You know I still love you
You knew I'd never change
And it's been five long years and I love you
Just the same
And it's been five long years and I love you
Just the same
And it's been five long years and I love you
Just the sa-a-a-a-a-me
Yes baby
Oh yeah
Five long years
Five long years<start>I think my heart was designed to fade and lose color
To turn inside out and wash in the rain
It loses all perfection in cold water
So the desired look is obtained
And it rises higher and higher
Like this filthy heat above the city sky
And I feel like I'm going mad dancing in the fire
As if I'm only here to prove there are mountains I could move
So love is spent dancing in the fire
Too high the cost and too quick the pain
And all that's left for the outsider
Is ashes from dancing in the fire
I think my eyes were made for deception
Interpreting lovers will call what we want the truth
With all I have seen burning behind these mirrors
The reflection they see is all that I pursue
And it rises higher and higher
Like this filthy heat above the city sky
And I feel like I'm going mad dancing in the fire
As if I'm only here to prove there are mountains I could move
So love is spent dancing in the fire
Too high the cost and too quick the pain
And all that's left for the outsider
Ashes from dancing in the fire
And voices get louder
And the air's too thick to breathe
Still I lie awake and I wait for the unknown power
Dying for want of sleep
I think my life line was stolen from a movie
The one where they are trying to solve the crime
But this prisoner is always one step before them
And everyone's running trying to stop me in time
And it keeps rising higher and higher
Like this filthy heat above the city sky
And I feel like I'm going mad dancing in the fire
As if I'm only here to prove
There are lovers I could move
Oh love is spent dancing in the fire
Too high the cost and too quick the pain
And all that's left for the outsider
Ashes from dancing in the fire<start>Wanna go for a ride?

di gente infame, che non sa cos' il pudore,
si credono potenti e gli va bene quello che fanno;
e tutto gli appartiene.
Tra i governanti, quanti perfetti e inutili buffoni!
Questo paese devastato dal dolore...
ma non vi danno un po' di dispiacere
quei corpi in terra senza pi calore?
Non cambier, non cambier
no cambier, forse cambier.
Ma come scusare le iene negli stadi e quelle dei giornali?
Nel fango affonda lo stivale dei maiali.
Me ne vergogno un poco, e mi fa male
vedere un uomo come un animale.
Non cambier, non cambier
si che cambier, vedrai che cambier.
Voglio sperare che il mondo torni a quote pi normali
che possa contemplare il cielo e i fiori,
che non si parli pi di dittature

And I've got friends that I know are really mine
I've got money just enough to see me through
But the only thing I really want is you
If I could have my way, I would love you
Like nobody's loved you, if I could have my way
I would love you like nobody's loved you
Like nobody's loved you
Well, I've got theories to think about
And I've got the answers if I need a way out
I got lovers if I'm ever in the mood
But the only thing I really want is you
If I could have my way, I would love you
Like nobody's loved you, if I could have my way
I would love you like nobody's loved you
Like nobody's loved you<start>Straight out of high school and into the jungle
Searching for Tarzan who might be dead
You kick like a mule, short of an Oscar
And screaming blue murder at newly weds

Who knows what goes on in her pretty little head
Who knows, who knows
Who knows what goes on in her pretty little head
Who knows what goes on in her pretty little head

Then blow the word bitch through your smoke ring
You cause only trouble, you bring only suffering
Just get in the spaceship and stop bleeding

Who knows, who knows
Who knows what goes on in her pretty little head
Who knows what goes on in her pretty little head
Why do you never sing in church on Sundays?
Why won't you ever go all the way?

Hanging from the rafters like a church bell
You're light years away from reality
Lonely, lost in a white Russian galaxy

And nothing you could do to stop me feeling the way I do
And if the chance should happen that I never see you again
Just remember that I'll always love you
I'd be a better person on the other side I'm sure
You'd find a way to help yourself
Then find another door
To shrug off minor incidents
Make us both feel proud
I'd just wish I be there to see you through
You always were the one to make us stand out in the crowd
Though every once upon a while your head was in a cloud
There's nothing you could never do to ever let me down
And remember that I'll always love you<start>I felt it when the sun came up this morning
I knew I could not wait another day
Darling, there is something I must tell you
A distant voice is calling me away
Until we find a bridge across forever
Until this grand illusion brings us home
You and I will always be together
From this day on you`ll never walk alone
You`re a part of me, I`m a part of you
Wherever we may travel
Whatever we go through
Whatever time may take away
It cannot change the way we feel today
So hold me close and say you feel it too
You`re a part of me, and I`m a part of you
I can hear it when I stand beside the river
I can see it when I look up in the sky
I can feel it when I hear that lonesome highway
So many miles to go before I die
We can never know about tomorrow
Still we have to choose which way to go
You and I are standing at the crossroads
Darling, there is one thing you should know....
You`re a part of me, I`m a part of you
Wherever we may travel
Whatever we go through
Whatever time may take away
It cannot change the way we feel today
So hold me close and say you feel it too
You`re part of me, and I`m a part of you
I look at you your whole life stands before you
I look at me and I`m running out of time
Time has brought us here to share these moments
To look for something we may never find
Until we find a bridge across forever
Until this grand illusion brings us home
You and I will always be together
From this day on you`ll never walk alone
You`re a part of me, I`m a part of you
Wherever we may travel
Whatever we go through
Whatever time may take away
It cannot change the way we feel today

Here we go if you're fighting for the Cause
We found ourselves as victims but we let it pass in the hopes of better days to come
But nothing comes for free in this wicked world
So you seek it out or don't get none
You can expect to be abandoned when it all comes down
Isn't that the way it goes?
Here we go with one for the Underdogs
Here we go if you're fighing for the cause
We grow up fast, you know that i did
I never grew to fit the mold
Against the grain is the way that i run
and it's the only way I've ever known
No one's fighting for you when it all comes down
Stick by the path you chose
Here we go with one for the Underdogs
Here we go if you're fighting for the cause
Here we go with one for the Underdogs<start>Im a man of few words baby,

Take one big as my own head.
Its gonna take a aspirin,
Take one big as my own head.
Whoa!!!
Help me!
What Im trying to tell you
Is how much I love you,
How much I love you in that dress.
And the way the light,
Bounces off your hair,
Warms me in ways I cant express.
No!
They put me in a line-up,
You said oh yes, Im sure its him.
They put me in a line-up, momma
You said oh yes, Im sure its him.
No!

Did your mom get back from her business trip
Is she there or is she trying to give me the slip
You know I'm not the little boy that I used to be
I'm all grown up now, baby can't you see
Stacey's mom has got it going on
She's all I want and I've waited for so long

Stacey do you remember when I mowed your lawn
Your mom came out with just a towel on
I could tell she liked me from the way she stared
And the way she said you missed a spot over there
And I know you think it's just a fantasy
But since your dad walked out
Your mom could use a guy like me

For the benefit of Tom and Mary
Before our guests arrive
If they haven't found out already
It's gonna blow their minds
Will they find the strength
To find the will to testify
That for the benefit of Tom and Mary
There's something we can't hide anymore?
Everybody here knows the story
Some with fabricated extra parts
See the sisters shout in whispers
Feeding hot air to the sparks
Put a damper on the party
It will lighten up this room
But for the benefit of Tom and Mary
We've got to see the truth today
Ms. Suthernson says "here they come"
And all the chatter and the smiles
They come undone
You could hear a pin drop on the carpet floor
Everyone's pretending not to hear them
Knocking at the door
For the benefit of Tom and Mary
Before our guests arrive
If they haven't found out already
It's gonna blow their minds
Haven't found out already
And yet the seams all seem to show
That for the benefit of Tom and Mary
For the benefit of Tom and Mary

We gotta let the truth me known, yeah<start>Woke up on Monday and wrote you a love song, wrote you a love song
Well the pen stopped and the paper flew out the window
And the notes rang down the road
I don't know where they'll go get caught in the trees I suppose
Ripped apart by the birds and the winter winds whisper good bye to your love
Went out walking into the storm, into the storm
Followed what I thought was your voice but it was just the riverside
I don't know where they'll go but I cast the letters you wrote
Taken out by the current or sink to the bottom to say a little goodbye to your love
Skies dark and the wind blew the trees down
I watched as the world slipped away
Carved into the bark a final love song
Then I carried the words to the fire
Staring into the glow where the branches are burning low
Sparks shooting out like stars and in the morning say a little goodbye to your love<start>Minding his own business
Riding subway trains
Got ripped off twice
Ain't gonna happen again
Withdrew a hundred dollars
Bought himself a piece
Can't depend on anyone
He's his own police
Fourteenth Street station
This could be the night
December, he's heavily sweating
Collar feels too tight
Tired of being preyed upon
By the scum of the earth
Tonite he'll be the predator
Someone's gonna get hurt
Walked into an empty car
Found himself a seat
Five low lives waiting there
Waiting for fresh meat
One by one surrounded him
Trapped him by the door
Finger on the trigger
Got more than they asked for
A split second without thinking
Hot gun in his hand
Four shots of blood
Bernie gets his man
Now he stands trial
A criminal he's told
But he got the satisfaction
Of shooting his load<start>400 miles down the mexican coast

only memories and you werent there so stop wasting your time
pray on the innocent, shes so young and unexperienced
she makes you feel like the whole wide world
revolves around your head
Attracted to the ignorance
shes so obsessed
but you wont kiss her virgin lips
you need it less
but youll take away her innocence
Subtract the only diffrence, think back on every hour lived
a few short years ago you never would have pictured this
So are you asking any questions, are you learning any lessons
Just pass down the torch that burned you when you learned you could forgive
Attracted to the ignorance
shes so obsessed
but you wont kiss her virgin lips
you need it less
but youll take away her innocence
Enjoy yourself at her expense, lie to her, pretend
when its convenient make it meaningful,
dont open up the door, dont give her any more
when its convenient make it meaningful
so are you taking any chances, are you taking her for granted
moving down the line to move towards the end with no regrets
Attracted to the ignorance
shes so obsessed
but you wont kiss her virgin lips
you need it less
but youll take away her innocence,innocence [x2]

With your leave Van Bushell said
He had further heard the cock crow
As he stumbled out the shed
Then blind Joseph came towards him
With a shotgun in his arms
He said you'll pay me twenty dollars
Before you leave my farm
Van Bushell saw the hook
Which replaced Joseph's hand
He said now calm you down my brother
Let's discuss this man to man
It's no good you getting angry
We must try to act our age
You're pursuing your convictions
Like some hermit in a cage
You're the son of your father
Try a little bit harder
Do for me as he would do for you
With blood and water bricks and mortar
He built for you a home
You're the son of your father
So treat me as your own
Well slowly Joseph well he lowered the rifle
And he emptied out the shells
Van Bushell he came towards him
He shook his arm and wished him well
He said now hey blind man that is fine
But I sure can't waste my time
So move aside and let me go my way
I've got a train to ride
Well Joseph turned around
His grin was now a frown
He said let me just refresh your mind
Your manners boy seem hard to find
You're the son of your father
Try a little bit harder
Do for me as he would do for you
With blood and water bricks and mortar
He built for you a home
You're the son of your father
So treat me as your own
Well there's two men lying dead as nails
On an East Virginia farm
For charity's an argument
That only leads to harm
So be careful when they're kind to you
Don't you end up in the dirt
Just remember what I'm saying to you
And you likely won't get hurt
You're the son of your father
Try a little bit harder
Do for me as he would do for you
With blood and water bricks and mortar
He built for you a home
You're the son of your father
So treat me as your own
You're the son of your father
So treat me as your own

Well I got a rocket '88 Prone 269
Spinnin' around and down leavin' everything behind

Across a thigh of satin and through a veil of mist

Come back around

Burning out for solo

And she's already
Workin' on my brain.

Up something I just can't explain.

I'm pickin' up good vibrations,
She's giving me excitations.
Good, good, good - good vibrations.
I, I bet I know what she's like.
And I can feel how right she'd be for me.
It's weird, how she comes in so strong.
And I wonder what she's pickin' up from me?
[Chorus]
I don't know where but she sends me there -
Ah my my, what a sensation!
Ah my my, what an elation!
Gotta keep those lovin' good
Vibrations a-happenin' with her.
Ah good, good, good, good vibrations.<start>T'lah lama ku nantikan, tak pernah ada kesempatan

I crumple the note and save it to put inside
My shoe box (shoe box)
My shoe box of lies
It's under my bed, it's never been read
It's in with my school stuff and my mom never cleans there
From my first little fib, when I still wore a bib
To my latest attempt at pretending I'm someone
Who's not seventeen, and doesn't know what you mean
When talk turns to single malts, or stilton, or
My shoe box (shoe box)
My shoe box of lies
My shoe box (shoe box)
Shoe box of lies
Did somebody tell you
This is how it's supposed to be?
Or did you just find it
And you don't want any more from me?
Was it something I said, or was it something you read
That's making me think that I should never have come here
I can offer you lies, I can tell you goodbye,
I can tell you I'm sorry, but I can't tell the truth, dear
And what if I could? Would it do any good?
You'll still never get to see the contents of
My shoe box (shoe box)

Comes out brown, it was on television they took her brain uptown
Fearing peace would poison her, some abstract modern saint

Royal Rose's ovens, have to warm what the furnace skips
Inner City Spillover, pop the scene

You find the ace of hearts and win, it's easy, man
At a higher school of knowledge, they put her brain in college
Replacement parts and slippery cards will come around again
The writings on the wall, statesmen say it all
With the art wars on and the colors crash
Long, long before the fall
One out of these three cards will definitely up the odds
Find the red heart, red to win, drop on in, time out and time in
All the suckers play it again by the Broadway Babies
And the island men and the hotshots gamblin
Inner City Spillover, pops and picks

Evil is forever
And you want to go, but one day you shall pay
So evil
Evil is forever
Evil is forever
Evil is forever
And it makes me wanna cry
Evil is forever
Soon I'm gonna die
Evil is forever
Can you hear me now?
Evil is forever
Gonna die

Tell me whatcha going to do
Show me whatcha you're going through
Its all right if you wanna take a motor ride
and tell me whats been going on
show me where it all went wrong
Its all right if you want to take a motor ride Ride
Chorus 1
So tell me whatcha going to do when it all comes around
when you find that I'm still here and I'm everything
now tell me whatcha going to do when it all comes down
when you're standing over there ya you're standing at the edge of tomorrow now
Verse 2
Tell me whatcha going to do
show me whatcha going through
Its all right if you wanna take a motor ride
And tell me where you need to go
show me what i need to know
Its all right if you wanna take a motor ride Ride
Chorus 2
So tell me whatcha going to do when it all comes around
when you find that I'm still here and I'm everything
now tell me whatcha going to do when it all comes down
when you're standing over there ya you're standing at the edge of tomorrow now
Bridge
And its hard to see what the world can be when its all in your hands
and i cant believe that you just dont seem to know
Chorus 3
Tell me whatcha going to do when it all comes around
when you find that I'm still here and I'm everything
now tell me whatcha going to do when it all comes down
when you're standing over there ya you're standing there at the edge of tomorrow now now now now now.<start>I believe
I believe sometimes I touch
I believe, love
I deserve
I deserve, much more than this
I deserve, love
This is hopeless now
As the minute stall
Sometimes I don`t mind at all
Particularly the times with you
O.K. that`s fine as long as you believe
The only things moving don`t mean a thing
Can you believe it, it`s getting blue
Straight through, line for line, trash
Don`t touch this<start>Now in Vienna there are ten pretty women
There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows
There's a tree where the doves go to die
There's a piece that was torn from the morning
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost
I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws
Oh, I want you, I want you, I want you
On a chair with a dead magazine
In the cave at the tip of the lilly
In some hallway where love's never been
On a bed where the moon has been sweating
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand
I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take its broken waist in your hand
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging its tail in the sea
There's a concert hall in Vienna
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking
They've been sentenced to death by the blues
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture
With a garland of freshly cut tears?
I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz, it's been dying for years
There's an attic where children are playing
Where I've got to lie down with you soon
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns
In the mist of some sweet afternoon
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow
All your sheep and your lillies of snow
I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
With its "I'll never forget you, you know!"
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging its tail in the sea
And I'll dance with you in Vienna
I'll be wearing a river's disguise
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder
My mouth on the dew of your thighs
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook
With the photographs there, and the moss
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty
My cheap violin and my cross
And you'll carry me down on your dancing
To the pools that you lift on your wrist
Oh my love, oh my love
Take this waltz, take this waltz
It's yours now, it's all that there is
(La-la-la, la-la-la)
(La-la-la, la-la-la)
(La-la-la, la-la-la)

Sign of God...
It's over all that you see
...But it cannot rescue me
Sink in the void
Of how it went down...
You'll know through all that you'll see
...And you'll know your enemy
Space is the word.
All the mankind
Tied in bounds
Over all that we know,
Is chaos moving slow...
Drinking the wine
...Howling it down
Corroding all that's still,
My fate and your free will
(Are you ready?)
...well I've made my bed...
(Say are you ready?)
...I've made some preparations...
(Are you ready?)
...but I'm older now ...
(But are you ready?)
Yeah...
Fine.
I'll close tight and go
Like theres nobody listening
I say oh my child,
They're listening.
...They listen.
I'm sewed tight and gone
...Like theres nobody listening
I say Oh My God...
I'm listening...
I LISTEN.

Oh you've got it, without fanatic hold to body
How your Semitic hold to God it seems so funny...
Now, we become...

There's no fun at all...
When theres nobody listening
I say Oh My God...
I've missed this.
I'VE MISSED ME.

Tossing your hand
If no one's there
Then why do you care?
Though I let you think there was no witness to
All of your crimes
I knew what you worn
The climate declines
I'm living a lie,
You're living it too
Cause I live it with you
I'm living a lie, a lie can't tell
So wait for the crack in the shell
Know that there's a, I've been avoiding yes
Just past his prime
Building his cage, a bar at a time
For every hope I'm as a cold shoulder
Waiting to turn
People to blame
We're just 2 birds
I'm living a lie,
You're living it too
Cause I live it with you
I'm living a lie, a lie can't tell
So wait for the crack in the shell
But girl around, do the time on your ground
Is the shakiest leaf on the tree
Creating for you a song or two
Or now and I'll admit all achieves
Now there's too many cooks
But you like how it looks
When they're bowing and calling it bothers
But the powers that were invested in her
And now any means taken, lost
I'm living a lie,
You're living it too
'Cause I live it with you
I'm living a lie, a lie can tell
So wait for the crack in the shell
Yeah wait for the crack in the shell<start>What happened to the sweet love you and me had
Where did all of that stuff start to go so bad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had
Where did all of that stuff start to go so bad
Out of control
Walking on the edge of my soul
Bad, out of control
The best laid plans never get laid
The best laid plans
Never get laid<start>She said,
Out with the boys don't cut it no more
And "I'm sorry" is just noise, she's heard it all before
Said that ring on her finger, well it feels like prison
She's talked 'til she's blue, and I don't listen
[Chorus]
I went too far this time,
Crossed over that line,
I'm past the point of no return
Livin' proof some fools never learn
Well I pushed my luck, now she's givin' up
Somethin' tells me I went too far this time
She said,
Save your breath boy, I've heard it all,
And keep your place there with your back to the wall,
Said I'm leavin' you lonely 'cause I've had my share
Save those worn out "I love you's" for someone that cares
[Chorus]<start>I see the future not the past
I won't let go, I'll make this last
I won't give up, I'll find a way
The same old faces haunting me
But I won't let them control me
I'm good enough and I'm strong enough
So don't let go, just hold on tightly
I won't give up until I find a way
I'm at the end of the road
There's no turning back now
I've come too far, I'm only miles away
I'm looking deep inside myself
Searching for the one way out
'Cause I won't let this slip away
So every night I hope and pray
Knowing that I'll find a way
I won't give up, no I won't give up
So don't let go, just hold on tightly
I won't give up until I find a way
I'm at the end of the road
There's no turning back now
I've come too far, I'm only miles away
So just look into my eyes
And try to read my mind
Explore all the treasures locked in me
So just look into my eyes
Then you'd realize
That you're the one who's haunting me
So don't let go, just hold on tightly
I won't give up until I find a way
I'm at the end of the road
There's no turning back now
I've come too far, I'm only miles away
I've come too far
I'm only miles away<start>Don't try to resist
You're coming with us
Provisions are made
Accommodations have met
Your words are encoded
In the bleak genetics of the mob
Praise apocrypha, omitted offense
To relieve us of guilt but not of our sin
We've sacrificed discourse at the feet
Of your clever turn of phrase
Now you owe it to us
We demand to be taken aback
To be shown the revival of hope
For which your words are responsible
Oh, it's the end of the line
I'm cornered by a precedent
The sneering public eye
My job here is done
My job here is done
You're fucking welcome
Retract the accolade the candid acclaim
Inspiration is cutting its loss
Regurgitate headlines or a theory on modern art
You've been fooled again, the red herrings a joke
I've tried so hard to tell you
That I've tapped the well dry
But there's no word
Stay wistful and young
The affected are banking on oblivion
In the drone of embittered hope
And we're sold by the way they wrote it
Oh, it's the end of the line
I'm cornered by a precedent
The sneering public eye
My job here is done
My job here is done
It is better to destroy
Than to create what is meaningless
So the picture will not be finished
Get out of here<start>Late, middle of the night
Hear it in the hallways
Caught in another fight
Forever and always
Everything you want from me is
Everything I want to be
One day
Everything you want from me is
Everything I want to be
I, I shoulda seen it coming
Here we go again
Is this the end
Should I say I'm sorry?
We've been down this road
More times than I know
Should we say it's over?
Hate shouted in each line
Never shoulda said it
Take just a little time
Before you regret it
Everytime I wanna stray
Something makes me wanna stay
Always
Everytime I wanna stray
Something makes me wanna stay
I, I never see it coming
Here we go again
Is this the end
Should I say I'm sorry?
No! Let's go lie down
The sun is out
And it's now tomorrow<start>Felony
In tight blue jeans
I did not know
She was so sweet
Felony
What ya did ta me
The judge said sorry
First degree
[Chorus]
You're here in my heart
Felony
You're here in my heart
Felony, felony, felony, yeah
Felony, felony, felony
Well I was shot down
By a heart so cruel
You were were laughin' yeah
You took me for a fool
I'm struck down
Left lyin' in the dirt
I never knew
How much love it hurts
[Chorus]
Harvard paid
Detective man
I'm in his sights
I'm on the run
Those tight blue jeans
That drove me wild
I did not know
She was just a child
Felony, yeah
[Chorus]
Felony, felony, felony<start>Feel like an old railroad man
Ridin' out on the Bluemont line
Hummin' along old dominion blues
Not much to see and not much left to lose
And I know I can walk along the tracks
It may take a little longer but I'll know how to find my way back
I feel like an old railroad man
Who's really tried the best that he can
To make his life add up to something good
But this engine no longer burns on wood
And I guess I may never understand
The times that I live in are not made for a railroad man
I feel like an old railroad man
Getting on board at the end of an age
The station's empty and the whistle blows
Things are faster now and this train is just too slow
And I know I can walk along the tracks
It may take a little longer but I'll know how to find my way back<start>We are the pretty people
We are the pretty people
I cannot help it that I'm so good looking
I cannot help it that I have the perfect body
Yes, everywhere I go I get all the attention
I get my looks by divine intervention
We are the pretty people
You want to look like us
We are the pretty people
Give it up, give it up, give it up
We are the pretty people
Best of humankind
We are the pretty people
Flawless by design
I look so good when I'm driving in my car
I'm in the fastlane, and I'm gonna be a star
Green light, green light, please don't turn yellow
Cause if you do you know I'll step down on that pedal
You know I never have to pay for my dinner
Aw yeah, you know I'm always the winner
You want me but you cannot have it
I'll slap your hand if you try to grab it
We are the pretty people
You want to look like us
We are the pretty people
Give it up, give it up, give it up
We are the pretty people
Best of humankind
We are the pretty people
Flawless by design
Well if you make a pass a little razzmatazz
A wink of the eye as I walk on by
Well if you make a pass
A little pinch on the ass
Yeah, a little razzmatazz but no kiss goodnight
We are the pretty people
You want to look like us
We are the pretty people
You want to look like us, yeah<start>My girlfriend was
Babysitting down the street
So I bought some soda pop
And sandwich meat
She laid it on the table
And I took a seat
But I never got the
Chance to drink or eat
[Chorus]
Cause one kiss led to another
And another and another
One kiss led to another
And another and another
The lights were low
When she turned on the radio
I could hear the music
Playing soft and low
I said, we better dance
Before I flip my lid
We both got up to dance
But we never did
[Chorus]
I thought the night was young
Until I saw the clock
The clock was striking midnight
It was quite a shock
I started for the door
But she grabbed my sleeve
She put her arms around me
Man, I couldn't leave
[Chorus]
One kiss led to another
And another and another
And another and another
And another and another
And another and another<start>Oh Lord, wish my bed wasn't silken sheets so tight
I got to keep my strength up got to do a show tonight
I'll have a cup of coffee while I'm taking in the news
No need to have a shave 'cause I'm gonna sing the blues
Well, I think I'll get a massage, maybe lose a little fat
So I'll have to go downtown in my brand new Cadillac
My valet comes and dresses me, I light a big cigar
Because I like to look like Nimrod when I'm riding in my car
Can blue men sing the whites
Or are they hypocrites for singing, woo, woo, wooh?
And now it's getting near the time, I gotta make the scene
I change out my dark gray mohair suit put on my dirty jeans
The band comes round to pick me up, I holler, "Hello, boys"
I gotta mess my hair up, I'm gonna make some noise brrr
Can blue men sing the whites
Or are they hypocrites for singing woo, woo, wooh?
Oh Lord, somebody help me<start>[Chorus: ]
The chances you gave me
A definite maybe
But luck she's a lady, stayed
She played for me
There's gold in the mountain
Good fortune for countin'
Three coins in the fountain
And my luck won't change
Take dust from the coalmine
Make dust from the goldmine
King Midas you're sidelined
And my luck won't change no my luck remains
[Chorus: ]
No point in shouting,
Whoever there was doubting,
I'm at the top of the mountain
And my luck won't change
The stock market read it
The rumors they spread it
And I meant it when I said it
That my luck won't change
No, my luck remains
That old lover lost me
She spent and she cost me
My new love has taught me
That my luck won't change
(my luck won't change, my luck remains)
[Chorus: ]
The offer she made me
Was more than just maybe
But luck who's a lady stayed
She played for me
[Repeat: 1st verse]
[Chorus: ]
My temperature's rising
No point in disguising
The phoenix is arising
And my luck won't change, no it just remains<start>(derry weaver)
Instrumental<start>When there something
That won let you sleep
Can you live with
The secrets you keep
All the pain all the pride
All the poison youe taken
That killing you inside
There a manifested bitterness
In all the joy youe known
There no point in redemption
Some things are better left alone
Ie waited
For freedom from bondage of self
Grow tired of everyone else
Grown cold
Grown sick of the doctrine
The lies that Ie been told<start>I remember the day you appeared on this earth
With eyes like the ocean, got blood on my shirt
From my camera angle it looked like it hurt
But your mama had a big old smile
We drove you home, saw your yellowing skin
Packed a few things and drove you back again
Stayed up all night worrying, wondering
What was gonna make it better
Broken bones heal when you set them right
Get your fine tooth comb from the barbicide
Our love's a protective poison
But you are your mother's child
But she'll keep you for a while
One someday you'll be grown and then you'll be on your own
Halloween costume, looking real cute
With your pillowcase full, in your astronaut suit
But your cousin the cowboy is eyeing your loot
Better watch your Snickers bar
Out on the diamond, now you're up to bat
Chewing your big league, adjusting your hat
Taking a swing and hearing it crack
Look at that apple fly
Tears will dry if you give them time
Life's a roller coaster, keep your arms inside
Fear that's a big emotion
But you are your mother's child
And she'll keep you for a while
But some day you'll be grown and then you'll be on your own
Posing for pictures, cap and a gown
Summer is coming, you're driving around town
Everyone's asking what you're gonna do now
I know you're gonna make a splash
And find you a sweetheart to treat you so kind
Take her to dinner and kiss her goodnight
What I couldn't teach you, you will realize
She's the only thing that matters
Although he's a bastard, make your papa proud
Your a fine young man and I got no doubt
That you're gonna do this better
'Cause you are your mother's child
She had you for a while
Now that you're grown, may you never be on your own
Now that you're grown, may you never feel this alone<start>F nenhuma

my astral body flies
I see the real sun falling apart
due to my fall from the skies
Misscreation, devestation
rules the land where I am God
As I am the wind and you are the sand
you'll do anything that I command
Midian- Soon we walk the earth without fear
Follow me out when the sun has died

No-one can stop us from inherit the earth
It is ours, it used to be and will belong to us again
You had no right to take it
We will rule the world with our new master-race

Fantme flou et tourment
Tout le portrait d'un ange dchu

Telle une ombre fugitive
Qu'une trop grande lumire tuerait
Une me trouble la drive
Dont les souvenirs s'effacaient
Douleur coupable dans la tte
La honte masquait son visage
Elle se tranait l'aveuglette
L'unique survivante d'un naufrage
D'une beaut ternelle
Dont j'ignorais tous les tourments
Comme victime d'une bote qui recelle
Tous les maux et les chtiments
Pandore demi-desse condamne
Les yeux voils par le nant
J'ai vu des larmes chaudes et sales
Couler sur tes joues lentement
Faut-il se gaver de poison
Pour connatre le got de la vie?
Et faut-il vivre d'interdictions
Pour avoir droit au paradis?
Toutes les larmes de Pandore... (4x)
Pour ceux qui savent chtier sans savoir pardonner
Pour ceux qui n'savent qu'accuser, juger, condamner
Y'a des mes damnes, des cauchemars veills
Des cicatrices brlantes et trop de larmes verses...<start>In the beginning, I believed every word that you said
Now that you're gone my world is in shreds
Oh you loved me and left me
You took all the things that I needed so bad
I'm standing here wondering where is the love that I had oh

Give me silver, blue and gold
The color of the sky I'm told
My rainbow is overdue
In the beginning, there was something of love that was mine
Now that it's gone, whoa I'm crying
Oh the time that it takes for a love to grow cold
is a wonder to me
I'm walking around with my head hanging down
tell me where is she
CHORUS
Don't forsake me cause I love you
Don't forsake me cause I love you
CHORUS
CHORUS
Now CHORUS
Oh Don't forsake me cause I love you
Don't forsake me cause I love you<start>The red lights mean you're leaving
The white one's mean returning
Tell me how this story ends
And I'll keep them fires burning
The headlights look like diamonds
The taillights burn like coals
Tell me how this story ends
Before the fires go cold
The countryside's deserted
There's no one on the farms
The suburbs all are sleeping
The earthquakes set off car alarms
All after all now we aware
All after all the time we share
There's so much fears of world,
Types of world,
Tears of world<start>I can see your eyes are burnin'
I can feel your wheels are turnin'
in my heart I've been mistreated
the mistakes I've made before
I've just repeated
Chorus:
I should have listened
now the writing's on the wall
and you don't know what
you've been missin'
now you're headed for the fall
you're the one they call the liar
in the night while you lay sleepin'
but your mind still lies awake
out there deceiving
I don't want to let go
but I have to get away
now I want to let you know
that I'm leaving here today
you're the one they call the liar
say goodbye, now stop your cryin'
I won't take those alibis
oh, you've been lyin'
I should have listened...
by AleisterCrowley<start>I stood stone-like at midnight, suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and come out with my soul untouched
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd, but when they said, "Sit down," I stood up
Ooh...growin' up
The flag of piracy flew from my mast, my sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate, she couldn't sail but she sure could sing
I pushed b-52 and bombed them with the blues with my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school, never once gave thought to landing
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd, but when they said, "Come down," I threw up
Ooh...growin' up
I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere, and you know it's really hard to hold your breath
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared, I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well, my feet they finally took root in the earth, but I got me a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car
I hid in the mother breast of the crowd, but when they said, "Pull down," I pulled up
Ooh...growin' up
Ooh...growin' up<start>In the painted faces congregate
In the mating season
The seconds homes
They go alone
In no rush leave 'em
And there's a fountain
And a scimitar
Shaped yellow light
And it picks you up
And cuts you down to size
The people there
And the furniture
Start to seem important
A moment more
And you catch the floor
With a vivid and absorbent sharpened arc
Like the scimitar
Shaped yellow light
That picks you up
And cuts you down to size
Oh I had questions for the tap dancer
Sat on my lap
And she had child proof caps on her answers
Stone blower blow me a stone
And show me that handsome enchancer
She had a rock on her throttle
And a brown glass bottle full of
Shavings from the sun
Although those shoes affect your step
Don't forget whose legs you're on
There's a fountain and a scimitar
Shaped yellow light
And it picks you up
And it cuts you down to size<start>Its so crazy living in this world
Separating the stone and pearl
Like we do in the every day
Turn our attention this way
To ride up on the thing you do
I just walk up straight to you
Tell you what you probably know
There's a light that always shows
Your Sweet Eyes
I can't turn back anymore
Opportunity at my front door
Showing me I should get this way
You don't get asked every day
Change your mind and you change
Your plans
Then your heart starts to understand
What you've got right next to you
Realize what's coming through
Your Sweet Eyes
All I got to do when I'm sad
I just think about the times we've had
And all my fears just drift into space
There's nothing that can erase
Your Sweet Eyes
There's a star in the northern sky
Captivating me as I walk by
Showing me what I can become
Leave behind what is lost or won
Something's different with me, can you see
The truth is starting to come out of me
As I think about the hope I feel
I leave behind the world for something real
Your Sweet Eyes...<start>Back to back, worlds apart
In this endless fight when nobody's won
So far, on different sides of this battlefield
We've crossed the line
Will we be casualties of our own friendly fire
We're two hearts at war
We can't remember what we'er fighting for
Separated by nothing more than a bedroom door
Feels like a million miles between us
And the words become
Just like bullets from a smoking gun
Take 'em back before the damage is done
And someone runs, and love dies in the dark
Two hearts at war
We can hide, down in the trenches
We can rise up now and lower out defenses
Love again, cuz there is nothing worse
than loneliness
In the end, no-one surrenders
It goes on and on and on and on and on
These two hearts no more,
I know lover's pride is so hard to hide
But there's peace, I know, yeah I know<start>A monster used to chase me
Used to jump from the top of my stairs
I used to sit in the rain on the wet leaves
On top of the shed roof
(If my mother knew)
The clock on the wall has a good time with my time
The rain storming brainstorm is on its way
The pale color of the door that's seen everything before
But just from only one side
No warning, history rears it's ugly head
(Stepped on it's tale)
Still running from what I chase
The lesson learned has come so frail
The clock has fallen and the cuckoo's calling
And the Blackbirds congregate and shuffle
Their wings, I'm on the wire and they call me a liar
But this time I'm going to sing
Big words escape, fake, rape, escape
Just how I feel my textureless history
I store in a textured bag
(It's painted, real fine)
Your serious laughing, infectious clapping
Still a beat behind
Let's get to the root of the matter I have no roots
No matter I'll grow my own
Quitting's easier time is greasier
Slipping from the metronome
Big words bad time, yeah, yeah, yeah<start>,

looking out
looking back across the sky,
Trying to find a meaning,
knowing that I just left it all behind
Still I smell a lingering softness
Where did she go,
how did she go,
I want to know
I want to know that she'll be coming
here to me
Come on,
without you
I'll never feel the love inside of me
Come On, you know that we belong
come on, come on, come on, come on
Thinking back before her,
I never knew the meaning of alone
Still the flag is feeling foreign,
I live the day to escape into a phone
Speaking of a world not real then
where did she go
how did she go,
I want to know
I want to know that she'll be coming
here to me
Come on,
without you
I'll never feel the love inside of me
Come On, you know that we belong
come on, come on
Cause each of the kisses and my heart...
She's coming,
She's coming here to me,
I'm needing,
desiring to kiss her now,
I'm living for her,
breathing for her,
singing for her fairytale.
Come on,
without you
I'll never feel the love inside of me
Come On, you know that we belong
come on, come on<start>I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord
Well if you told me you were drowning, I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend, but I don't know if you know who I am
Well I was there and I saw what you did, I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies
And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord
Well I remember, I remember, don't worry, how could I ever forget
It's the first time, the last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up, oh no you don't fool me
Well the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you and me
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord<start>Morning will tell you what I couldn't say
Didn't really want to leave or didn't really want to stay
Yes it seems so unkind but what else can I do
No matter how I try just don't feel like loving you
Walking beside me you're walking alone
Never moving quite together cause I'm moving on my own
Trying hard to believe but what else can I do
No matter how I try just don't feel like loving you
Maybe I'll be sorry from the first night I'm alone
And I pray that I'll awaken by your side
But I can't believe in staying if I never tried to go
Yes I won't believe in love until I try
One night in one town or another town or two
Got no time for conversation barely time for passin' through
With no woman at heart comes no sorrow tonight
Baby nothing where I go and but there's nothing left behind
Maybe I'll be sorry<start>This kind of love ain't right
Won't take us through the night
This kind of love's not true
Not good for me or you
Woke up to find myself
Standing in another day
Filled with anxiety
I'm praying for a different way
I give it all I have
Till I have no more to give
I used to think I'd die for love
Now I'd rather live
If everywhere you look, you find some misery
The view from there can make you feel
Just a little crazy
This kind of love ain't right
Won't take us through the night
Some think love equals pain, but...
This kind of love's not true
Not good for me or you
I think we got to get out of this rain
Stay walking through life
Waiting for the other shoe to fall
Dreams cut like a knife
When you think you shouldn't dream at all
I saw a dark cloud
Looks like it follows us around
It doesn't take that much, you know
To make it tumble down
How did we ever go from being so happy
To suffer alone and be strong
Just so we can keep on giving up
This kind of love ain't right
Won't take us through the night
Some think love equals pain, but...
This kind of love's not true
Not good for me or you
I think we got to get out of this rain
If everywhere you look, you find some misery
The view from there can make you feel
Just a little crazy
This kind of love ain't right
Won't take us through the night
Some think love equals pain, but...
This kind of love's not true
Not good for me or you
I think we got to get out of this rain<start>If you've got love in your sights
Watch out, love bites
When you make love, do you look in your mirror?
Who do you think of?
Does he look like me?
Do you tell lies?
And say that it's forever?
Do you think twice, or just touch and see?
Ooh, babe
Ooh, yeah
When you're alone, do you let go?
Are you wild and willing or is it just for show?
Ooh, come on
I don't want to touch you too much baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it, no
(Love bites, love bleeds)
It's bringing me to my knees (love lives, love dies)
It's no surprise (Love begs, love pleads)
It's what I need
When I'm with you are you somewhere else?
Am I getting through or do you please yourself?
When you wake up will you walk out?
It can't be love if you throw it about
Ooh babe, I don't want to touch you too much baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy, oh
(Love bites, love bleeds)
It's bringing me to my knees (love lives, love dies)
It's no surprise (Love begs, love pleads)
It's what I need
Oh yeah, I don't want to touch you too much baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it, no
(Love bites, love bleeds)
It's bringing me to my knees (love lives, love dies)
(Love bites, love bleeds)
It's bringing me to my knees (love lives, love dies)
It's no surprise (love begs, love pleads)
It's what I need
If you've got love in your sights
Watch out, love bites
Yes it does, it will be hell<start>Rejected with no where to go
Disconnected from everything I've known
Forgotten, left out in the cold
Bound by the darkness around me
Just when I was losing hope
Then Your love breaks through endless pursuit
In spite of what and where I've been nothing left to prove
This heart rings true when You find me
(When You find me)
You remind me of who I really am
A story that's rarely been told
Show me what destiny holds
Waiting the future now unfolds
(The future now unfolds)
Oh yeah, now as the darkness is hiding
Hearts are flooded by Your hope
Then Your love breaks through endless pursuit
In spite of what and where I've been nothing left to prove
This heart rings true when You find me
(When You find me)
You remind me of who I really am
And now as the darkness is hiding
Just when I was losing hope
(Just when I was losing hope)
And now as the darkness is hiding
And now as the darkness runs
Then Your love breaks through endless pursuit
In spite of what and where I've been, oh
When You find me
(When You find me)
You remind me of who I really am<start>[Instrumental]<start>Passammo l'estate su una spiaggia solitaria
E ci arrivava l'eco di un cinema all'aperto
E sulla sabbia un caldo tropicale dal mare
E nel pomeriggio quando il sole ci nutriva
Di tanto in tanto un grido copriva le distanze
E l'aria delle cose diventava irreale
Mare mare mare voglio annegare
Portami lontano a naufragare
Via via via da queste sponde
Portami lontano sulle onde
A wonderful summer on a solitary beach
Against the sea, Le Grand Hotel Sea-Gull Magique
Mentre lontano un minatore bruno tornava<start>And so
Annie waits, Annie waits, Annie waits
For a call
From a friend
The same
It's the same
Was it always the same?
Annie waits for the last time
The clock never stops, never stops, never waits
She's growing old
It's getting late
And so he forgot, he forgot
Maybe not
Maybe he's been seriously hurt
Would that be worse?
Headlights crest the hill
Shadows pass her by and out of sight
(ooh ooh)
Annie sees her dreams:
Friday bingo, pigeons in the park
Annie waits for the last time
Just the same as the last time
Annie says "You see this is why I'd rather be alone."
And so
Annie waits, Annie waits, Annie waits
For a call
From a friend
The same
It's the same
Was it always the same?
Annie waits as the last
Headlights crest the hill
Who will be the one for evermore?
(ooh ooh)
Annie, I could be
If we're both still lonely when we're old
Annie waits for the last time
Just the same as the last time
Annie waits for the last time
Just the same as the last time
Annie waits
But not for me<start>what's that you say
gonna sleep all day
you're so uptight
got no sleep last night
so tired, been wired
gone crazy, so lazy
you say, I've been awake so long
my feet are 'bout to fumble
and I like how I feel
I've been wake so long my knees begin to tremble
don't turn out the light
I've been wake so long barely holding on
don't turn out the light
spiders in your bed
what's that you said
can't rest here
smoke the little ones
desperate fear
a cheap thrill, sleeping pill
go get your gun
you say, I've been wake so long
my feet are bout to fumble
I've been wake so long barely holding on
I've been wake so long my knees begin to tremble
spiders in my bed
and I like how I feel
spiders in my bed
spiders in my bed
yes, that's what I said
don't turn out the light<start>I surely knew it was a trap ye
Yet my hands they would not listen
I shoulda known your word was flap
Comin' out all sweet an drippin'
O so where could I go yes but to the lord
I been to your house an' see what you adore
I left there stiff stiff as a board
Where could I go but to the lord
When will I hurt for heaven's sake
When will I suffer for the sake of heaven
All my love well it is madness
Freely given to you folks with gladness
I will not live and die no not by the sword
I am weak without the joy of the lord
Taste and see that the lord is good
Let's bend our knees like we know we should
We can't see clear our eyes are made of wood
Taste and see boy that the lord is good<start>We'll milk the chickens, pluck the cows
Milk the chickens, pluck the cows
Put the dirty clothes in the drawer
Put the dirty clothes in the drawer
Move backwards at the bell
Move backwards at the bell
Move closer to the floor
Move closer to the floor
Milk the chickens, pluck them cows
Milk the chickens, pluck them cows
Walk into the door
Walk into the door
Watch them all bow
Watch them all bow
Well, he cried out for more
He cried out for more<start>I told you not to make me mad please
When I get mad you wouldn't like me
I turn into some kind of a monster
Go out to the bar and I do bad things
Now I'm outta control
I know
There's gon' be casualties
And when I get goin'
Let them know
You're the only who can stop me (Help, help)
You're the only who can stop me (Help, help)
You're the only who can stop me (Help, help)
When I fall I need you around me (Help, help)
You're the only who can stop me (Help, help)
Stop me (Help, help)
Stop me (Help, help)
Stop me (Help, help)
Stop me (Help, help)
Step on the floor I end up falling
I try to resist
Confusion calls me
When I get like this you wouldn't know me
Nobody moves
Won't hurt nobody
Now I'm outta control
I know
There's gon' be casualties
And when I get goin'
Let them know
You're the only who can stop me, stop me (Help, help)
You're the only who can stop me (Help, help)
You're the only who can stop me, stop me (Help, help)
When I fall I need you around me (Help, help)

I can cross the street all by my self now
I tend to sever the space that surrounds mine
And I seem to do it all the time now
Could I have a smidgen of you faith?
A strand of hair within a jar to pledge allegiance to you
Keep your dreams hidden behind a shelf
Don't tell no-one or they'll become possessions of somebody else
Guess I'm riding free beneath this moonlight
But this romance with my self is causing me to doubt
Try hard not to step on any pavement cracks
If I was ever there I can't seem to find my way home back
And I'm chained between more than four walls
Walls of my mind and I can't find the code to crack the lock
Not sure if it's me really riding now I'm like a ghost
Ghost of some road that everyone bypasses
And I just get so scared for myself
You can't rely on me or anybody else
Outside are the dogs so who can you trust
When you're scared?
When you're running so scared
When company's like vultures and your room's like some sepulchre
You found out
It weakens your resistance if you keep questioning your existence
So what now?
Open up, open up
There's no need to shut it down
Thaw it, thaw it out
Thaw the ice that's trying to hound you down to the ground
Buses, trains and miles of sheets of rain
Another night and it's alright
A little misadventure
Caught a cab, ran out of change again
It's not that bad, I've just been had, had by myself again<start>[You want to take a dive?]
[Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah]
[Watch out]
[It's quite all right]
[Through the night]
I saw it all from my bubble on the 15th floor
I was so unaware as I sank into my leather chair
Upon my throne I was known as untouchable
The smoke was creeping in
My castle walls were wearing thin
It took a fire to inspire me to make my move
Cigarette in a garbage can
Changed the ways of this corporate man
It was time for a radical plan
[Chorus]
I took a dive
I took a love plunge into Your arms
I took a dive
I took a love plunge into Your arms
I took a dive
I jumped in with all my heart
I took a dive
Follow me through the door to the great unknown
Something was telling me that this would shape my destiny
Take my hand, understand You are not alone
Shame on me if I oppose the stirring of the Holy Ghost
Heard a voice calling out to me [out to me]
I come to set your spirit free [spirit free]
And in Me you are free indeed
[Chorus]
[Ah ah ah ah, ah, ah, ah]
Won't you come and take a dive with me
[Ah, ah, ah, ah, ahhh]
Won't you come and take a dive with me
[Ah, ah, ah, ah, ahhh] Jump in with all your heart and take a dive
I'm breathing under water [i'm breathin' under]
I'm sinking like a submarine [a submarine]
Your ocean's so much deeper [i'm goin' deeper]
Than anything I've ever dreamed
[Chorus]
[Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah]
[Jump, jump]
Won't You come and take a dive with me
[Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah]
[Jump, jump]
Won't you come and take a dive with me
[Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah]
[Jump, jump]
Won't you come and take a dive with me
[Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah]
[Jump, jump, jump, jump]
Won't you come and take a dive with me
[Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah]<start>[Rival:]

Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
I've seen that movie too
It's a habit I have, I don't get pushed around
Stop twinkling your star like you do
I'm not the blue print for all of your 'b' films
Because I've seen that movie too
The one where the players are acting surprised
Saying love's just a four letter word
Between forcing smiles, with the knives in their eyes
All their actions become so absurd
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
That I've seen that movie too
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose

I keep asking myself why you don't.
Why do you always turn your back on me?
What's wrong with me?
You've always thought there's something wrong with me, haven't you?
Always!
You're pushed
You're pulled
You're snatched
You fail to hear the crack
You're stitched
You're taped
You cobble all you could
You're screened
You're cracked
You just can't fix it now
It's sad
It's tough
The demons I home-made
Hell and the things I've done to try and gain your love!
The things I've done!
But you never gave me the smallest bit of it!
What's that look you are giving me?
Are you thinking about the things I've done?
What do you think I've done?
Do you think that I am decent?
You think I'm a immodest girl?
Is that why you won't let me touch you?
The love
The care
The home
And all you never had
You fight
You urge
You know you have to
I hear the voices
I am cold and I hear the voices<start>I don't care what shirt you wear
And I don't want you to know my show?
You make me feel so nice
Get off your horse and kiss me twice
You taught me how to ride at night,
And quite alright...
My big city smile, won't last that long?
You gonna need a while, to cut my tongue
But instead we try, we say goodby
You are so cute, crystal cowboy cute
You are so neat, so street so sweet
You are a gun and I better run
And I say goodby (say good by)...<start>Way down, buried in your black heart
I found the part of you I fell for
Smiling in the dark you're like a spark
You light my soul on fire
Holding out your hand, you understand
That I am sick with desire
Why do I fall for you?
Why do I fall for you?
Why do I fall for you?
Why do I fall for you?
I think, I'm getting iller now
Every time you come around
Wasted, all our time together
Chasing every brand of pleasure
Lying at your side, eyes open wide
My heart and mind, all vacant
No one has a clue just what you do
To me, it's truly magic, yeah
Why do I fall for you?
Why do I fall for you?
Why do I fall for you?
Why do I fall for you?
Yeah, I think, I'm getting iller now
Every time you come around
Why do I fall for you?

i don't want it
i don't need it
there's nothing i can do about it<start>Well he can't sleep at night
And he can't do what's right
It was all because she came into his life
It's a deep obsession, taking up his time
She's all that he wants, she's all that he needs
She's everything he just won't believe
Take away his doubt, turn him inside out
Then she can see what he's been dying to say
But things don't always turn out that way
And he must confess
All the impure thoughts of his beautiful temptress
Although he keeps it all bottled up inside
Although he keeps it all safe within his mind, oh yeah
She's all that he wants, she's all that he needs
She's everything he just won't believe
Take away his doubt, turn him inside out
Then she can see what he's been dying to say
But things don't always turn out that way
So wipe that smile off your face
Before it gets too late
There's only so much time
For you to make up your mind
She's all that he wants, she's all that he needs
She's everything he just won't believe
Take away his doubt, turn him inside out
Then she can see what he's been dying to say
But things don't always turn out that way<start>Got a wife and two kids, all gathered around
A twenty-pound turkey, snow on the ground
Who says there ain't no Santa Claus
Eric wants a glove, he tears into a box
His eyes are wide with wonder,
I sit back and watch
Who says there ain't no Santa Claus
I haven't heard a single reindeer running on my roof
I just look into my children's eyes and there I see my proof
And could it be that jolly old man riding in his sleigh
Is really just the kid in us on every Christmas Day
Who says there's no Santa Claus
Molly gets a doll, Momma's camera clicks
Guess we all get the puppy, he's getting in his licks
Who says there ain't no Santa Claus
I?m trying to read a card in crooked red and blue
Only part that really matters is "Daddy, we love you"
Who says there ain't no Santa Claus
I haven?t heard a single reindeer running on my roof
I just look into my children's eyes and there I see my proof
And could it be that jolly old man riding in his sleigh
Is really just the kid in us on every Christmas Day
Who says there's no Santa Claus
Hey, I've heard there ain't no Santa Claus
But I know there?s got to be a Santa Claus<start>Oh, say can you see,
by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed
at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars,
through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched,
were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare,
the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night
that our flag was still there.
O say, does that star-spangled
banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free
and the home of the brave?<start>To know you, is to love you,but to know me, is not that way you see
'Cause you make me, so happy,that my love for you grows intensely
When I'm down and feelin' sad,you always comfort me
When I'm down and feelin' sad,you always comfort me
Baby, to know you is to love you,you smile when I see your face
'Cause there is no one on this earth
Baby, could ever, ever take your place
When I'm down and feelin' sad,you always comfort me
When I'm down and feelin' sad,you always comfort me
Oh, to know you is to love you,is to see you, being free as the wind
'Cause the power, of your loving, is to be strong to hold yourself within
To know you is to love you
To see you going free ...
The collar, of your loving
I never found a woman like you, that could be my lover 'n' my best friend
I know you, and I think I love you
I know you, and I think you love me
I know you and can't you feel our love just growing,growing, growing, growing,
growing, growing, hey

to see what opportunities arise
i hope that you can find a place
and maybe i will follow one day
computer time and you have what it takes
to get your heads down and be those greats
henry helped us realise
its worth it when we come out the other side
we are butterflies
working out our lives
in and out of cause
we don't need no camouflage
we are butterflies
working out our lives
in and out of cause
we don't need no camouflage
we're moving out to the countryside
to make the most of all that you can find
first turning now you've grown so tall
a gallery we'll build us upon a wall
now we've got this whole place to ourselves
we can take our insides off the shelf
the vocal always sticks in mind
and pushes til we come out the other side
we are butterflies
working out our lives
in and out of cause
we don't need no camouflage

Back under the corner, was the cream of the crop,
Evything was clickin?and the business was good,
ill one day, lo and behold an officer stood.
Johnny jumped the counter but he stumbled and fell,
But Tulane made it over Johnny just as he yelled,
Chorus: o head on, Tulane, he can catch up with you.
Go Tulane, he ain man enough for you.
Go Tulane, use all the speed you got.
Go Tulane, you know you need a lot.
Go Tulane, he laggin?behind.
Go ead on, Tulane.?br>
Go by your father house and tell him the business is slow
And see if he will loan us something, soon as he hits the dough.
Put the cat out in the hall and rumple up the room
Go by Doctor Keller, tell him you swollowed some perfume
Tell him we need him quick, uz he may to testify
That you been sick all day and that a perfect alibi
Go, let Danny drive in case you run into the Man
Back by the shop and get the stuff and hide it in the van
Go back by your father, get the money for the bail
And bring it down and bail me out this rotten, funky jail
We gotta get a lawyer in the click of politics
Somebody who can win the thing or get the thing fix<start>Come on pretty baby, let's move it and groove it
Well a shake-a baby shake, oh! honey please don't lose it.
It's rhythm that "gets you" heart and soul
Let me tell you baby; it's called rock an'roll.
They say, it's gonna die: oh! honey bee let's face it;
They just don't know what's-a goin' to replace it.
Ballads' and calypsos', they've got nothing on real
Country music that drives along.
Come one honey, move it
Well, let's move
Well, move it
The new second verse:
Come on pretty baby let's move it an' a groove it
Dance honey dance baby please don't lose it
'cause' all over town there's a brand new beat
An' it's hangin' in the air like the mississippi heat
Fireflies in the night an' bullfrogs croakin'
Well here comes the train an' boy is she smokin'
Headed out from new orleans 'n' clear to l.a.
Ya' better get ready it's a brand new day
Honey move it<start>I went stumbling through the fog trying to find a reason for the things I told her
She woke up sunny side down and I was still thinking I was too proud to flip her over
Between the champagne hand jobs and the kissing ass by everyone involved
Cocaine rich comes quick and that's why the small dicks have it all
So I'll meet you at the bottom if there really is one
They always told me when you hit it you'll know it
But I've been falling so long it's like gravity's gone and I'm just floating
Those little demons ain't the reasons for the bruises on your soul you've been neglecting
You'll never lose you're mind as long as you're heart always reminds you where you left it
And don't ever let them make you feel like saying what you want is unbecoming
If you were supposed to watch you're mouth all the time I doubt you're eyes would be above it
So I'll meet you at the bottom if there really is one
They always told me when you hit it you'll know it
But I've been falling so long it's like gravity's gone and I'm just floating
Between the champagne hand jobs and the kissing ass by everyone involved
What used to be is gone and what ought to be ought not to be so hard
So I'll meet you at the bottom if there really is one
They always told me when you hit it you'll know it
But I've been falling so long it's like gravity's gone and I'm just floating
But I've been falling so long it's like gravity's gone and I'm just floating
But I've been falling so long it's like gravity's gone and I'm just floating<start>You said it was OK
I guess I should be glad for you
But this is just a coop, and I'm not even there
I know why you hurt me
It's all because of pity
But I'll pick up the pieces of my heart you cut in
parts
This gotta be the real last ditch
Just give me some time
This gotta be the real last hell, but it may take a while
My life is like a cave-in, and it's getting darker now
If I gotta live, I won't settle for that
I'm gonna find a way
Even if it takes some time
And maybe on the way, I might find something good
Tell me that this is the last ditch<start>You turned off your fucking TV
And you don't listen to the radio
Well, you're looking really great to me
Well, you're blasting like a megaphone.
You drink the right amounts of water
And eat the protein that you need, now
Sing in the name of your father
Scratching off all the fleas!
The smell in the air rolled over the city today
It's fire and it's thick and it ain't going away.
There's a billboard down the road, now
For a new kind of patriot
Well, it's got a lot of tits and ass
Well, it's poppin' like a cherry bomb.
We've unplugged our VCRs now
Girl, we only read magazines
We rarely talk to each other
It's just our conflict of the means and genes.
We got it, got it going on
It's going, yeah, it's going
The next minute, it's gone.
The smell in the air rolled over the city today
It's fire and it's thick and it ain't going away.
There's something in the air today
Paint your worries up, they melt away.<start>There was a sense of disappointment as we left the mall
All the young people looked the same
Wearing their masks of cool and indifference
Commerce dressed up as rebellion
'Cause we're so handsome and we're so bored
So entertain us, tell me a joke
Make it long, make it last
Make it cruel, just make me laugh
We can't be hurt, we can't be hurt
Drink to forget your blues on the weekend
Think about more things to buy
The TV taught me how to sulk and love nothing
And how to grow my hair long
'Cause we're so handsome and we're so bored
So entertain us, tell me a joke
Make it long, make it last
Make it cruel, just make me laugh
We can't be hurt, we can't be hurt
We can't be hurt
So why do you go picking fights that you'll lose?
(When you have entertained them. When you have things to pass the time)
So why do you go thinking thoughts that are above you?
(You can be happy just playing dumb. You can be happy just playing dumb)
Well I was brave (and unique), intelligent (a snowflake)
I could have been a hero
No-one can be trusted under the age of fourteen
Tattoo our arms (Converse shoes), cynical ?
We tell ourselves we're different
I've gotten so good at lying to myself
(Oh!)
All my pain and honour is used up
(Oh! Oh! Oh!)
All my guns are rusted
So when you gonna realise
Those are not your wrongs to right?
Have another line, have another drink
I am a martyr, I just need a motive
I am a martyr, I just need a cause
I'm a believer, I just need a moment
I'm a believer, I just need a cause
We're finding it hard to break the mold
We're finding it hard to be alone
We're finding it hard to ourselves
We have nothing at all to say
Uniform
There was a sense of disappointment as we left the mall
All the young people looked the same<start>Ibrahim avec ses frres

Won't you walk me awhile, put a smile upon my face
I don't want to take your love in vain
Gonna keep on coming back again
Beauty leads the full grown child, a rose among the thorns
Like a ray of sunshine, she comes, heaven in my arms
I don't want to take your love in vain
Gonna keep on coming back again
When i see you smilin'
It takes away my pain
Oh, there's no denyin'
Can't keep away from the flame
A thousand indian summers, die in desert sands
The moon and lover's shadows, they go slippin' through our hands

Gonna keep on coming back again

Gonna keep on coming back again<start>I search alone, dark the night, deep the
Blackest forest, down the devil's hopyard
On my way from Salem I lit a fire
Magical brimstone sparks ashes from the
Hazel wood
Dancing with the banshee, fire rose up
To the sky.
The dead of night parts the sky, the Salem
Witch
Hunting eyes Malefica spells
She soars the ocean shore of Kildare
Over tombs of the harpy fields
Ride the great beast abandoned girls
Lonely girls ride the great beast
Virginal goddess of Hunt Diana
Through the Brocken Spectre rose a lureing
Angel
Sister of Morgana, forever dressed in black
Journey through the witch trials learned
Of lore
And wives tales
We fathomed the deepest oceans o her
Darkest mind
Searching lands of giants and dragons
Sail the oceans of serpents and krakens
Under ages of dark the Salem witch
Burned beneath mindless torture of men
Through the castles of demons and wizards
Cast to their fate the Moerea the sisters
Two hundred fifty thousand the Salem witch
In the bog of the Witch Meadow run
Malifica revenge plague have begun
Burned alive for a crim never done
Children of the darkness dance on the coven
Of the lost
In blazing pyre suspended in air she
Demands holocaust
She can exorcise with the whites of her eyes
She'll devour your children, in a wink of
An eye, descend from the sky to the
Cauldren of the damned.
Her burning lips urned the infamous kiss
She took me by the hand
In a wink of your eye she ascends to the sky
She unveiled my talisman I'm the
Witch finder general.<start>Tell her you're mine
That you have been blind
Tell her it's over
And you belong to me
Tell me to come
And like hell I will run
Back into your arms
'Cause you belong to me
There's a river on my skin
There's a dragon in the dark
Nothing scares me more
Than the silence of your heart
If you wanna hold me
If you wanna know me again
If you wanna love me
Than take me home
I've been at the bottom
The deep end of the ocean
Barely surviving by the dark side of her street
Tell her you belong to me
She'll never win
I'm not giving in
No matter how long
I still be hanging on
This kind of love
I'm not giving up
So tell her, tell her
Tell her you were fooling<start>well i know your name

They say that such alarms are normal, and present no problem provided they can be identified as false alarms. I said in 1983 there were two false alarms of impending nuclear war, every three days, but in times of crisis with weapons systems already on the alert, there is less than eight minutes to decide whether an attack is underway or not. And there are over forty conventional wars going on in the world today. Times of crisis, you might say. They say that waiting longer than eight minutes would risk a surprise attack, and a loss of command and control. In the trade this is called the "use them or lose them" problem, which translated means, if he's gonna hit you, make sure you hit him first. Looking at it another way, a single American strategic submarine carries about 160 warheads, enough to eliminate every Soviet city of over 200,000 people. Of course a Soviet submarine could do the same to America. The nuclear weapons powers operate about a hundred such submaries and on average there are over forty at sea at any one time. A conspiracy of two men, a submarine commander and his radioman, could pretend to have received orders from above, and launch a nuclear missile without actually having received those orders. In 1983 there were two false alarms of impending nuclear war every three days. In 1983 Thatcher was re-elected by her sleeping people. In 1984 Reagan was re-elected by his sleeping people. In 1985...

Burnt their bodies and collected their teeth
There's another man at home with his wife and family tree
Who agreed this would make a good movie
And I'm sittin' here,

He sold the book rights, and he was set for life
A woman on a talk show wants to be his wife
Another man decides to purchase his knife
A court decides he's got the right

Wonderin' how he can ever sleep at night
I don't want to walk where he walked
I don't want to talk to who he stalked
I don't want to walk where he walked

They cut it all up and they put it on the TV
The starring role was played by Christopher Lee
He was fine, he was something to see
And I'm sitting here,

I don't want to walk where he walked
I don't want to talk to who he stalked
I don't want to walk where he walked

And I'll keep on running this never ending race
Maybe next time will be the right time
And maybe next time will be your time
So save your scissors someone else's skin
My surface is so tough, I don't think the blade will dig in
Save your strength, save your wasted time
There's no way that I want you to be left behind
Go on save your scissors, save your scissors
So why does it always seem
That every time I turn around somebody falls in love with me?
This has never been my soul intention
And I have never claimed to have pates on such inventions
Just save your scissors someone else's skin
My surface is so tough, I don't think the blade will dig in
Save your strength, save your wasted time
There's no way that I want you to be left behind
Go on save your scissors, save your scissors
There is something that I must confess
To you tonight, to you tonight
And that is I expect nothing less
From you tonight, from you tonight
Go on save your scissors
Save your scissors, save your scissors<start>Sweet and tender on my tongue
I taste your tears of passion and sadness in our love
Together we`ll get lost in there
Together we won`t find out, (that) one of us two was a liar

Let me show you how
Let me show you how I could believe someone like you
Please can you deceive me, I would know
Please can you release me, I would know
Please can you believe me, I would know
Please can you forgive me now
Bored and tired in my skin
A feeling like i`ll never see you again, no never again
(It) seems, that I have lost this game
(It) seems, that I have not known what everyone should know
I am here somehow
I am here right now
I am here for my love, that is real and I want to know
Please can you deceive me, I would know
Please can you release me, I would know

How have I let you down?
I curse the day that I was born
And all the sorrow in this world
Let me take you to the hurting ground
Where all good men are trampled down
Just to settle a bet that could not be won
Between a prideful father and his son
Will you guide me now, for I can't see
A reason for the suffering and this long misery
What if every living soul could be upright and strong
Well, then I do imagine
There will be sorrow
Yeah there will be sorrow
And there will be sorrow no more
When all soldiers lay there weapons down
Or when all kings and all queens relinquish their crowns
Or when the only true messiah rescues us from ourselves
It's easy to imagine
There will be sorrow
Yeah there will be sorrow
And there will be sorrow no more
There will be sorrow
Yeah there will be sorrow
And there will be sorrow no more
Yeah there will be sorrow
Yeah there will be sorrow
And there will be sorrow no more<start>I just can't get 2 sleep
Feels like a couple of weeks I been trying
The sound of this train is keep
Keeping everybody from hearing me crying
'Cause with every other beat of my heart
I know that we should never b apart
And if it hurts this bad by dawn
I'm gonna stop this train & never get back on
Sleeping with ur face on my phone
A face that I never shoulda left alone
Pillowcase full of ur cologne
Yes I gotta crush & it'll never b outgrown
Every other beat of my heart
I know that we should never b apart
& if it hurts this bad by dawn
I'm gonna stop this train & never get back on
Nothing makes sense 2 me & nobody's got a clue
'Cause nothin' & nobody makes me feel like u do
Thought I'd b as high as the sky
Rock n roll 4ever & never die
Used 2 never need a reason 2 fly
Now I c that u're the only reason 2 try
It don't matter who's right or wrong
I never want 2 b the one singing this song
If it hurts this bad by dawn
I'm gonna stop this train and never get back on
Never get back on...
I just can't get 2 sleep<start>I could paint your pictures all night long
And tell you tales of every song
Still let you know that you're the reason
Why I'm home
Or I could quote a page of poetry
To show you what you mean to me
And we go falling somewhere faster
Knowing we don't want to ever fall at all
I just don't think that this will be easy
Saying that you love me
Lying tongues are clumsy
And don't speak when one more word would kill me
Saying that you love me
When lying tongues are clumsy
But who am I to say
That every breath we take
Won't be another pointless kiss we gave away
When what we love we burn
Its from the ashes that we yearn
To be the phoenix that rises from up from the flames
Don't think that this will be easy
Saying that you love me
When lying tongues are clumsy
Don't think that this will be easy
Saying that you love me
When lying tongues are clumsy
And don't speak when one more word would kill me
Saying that you love me
When lying tongues are clumsy
I could paint your pictures all night long
And tell you tales of every song
And let you know that you're the reason why I'm home<start>Warning the Basemaster General has determined that coffee is good for your health Doug is bouncing off the walls Ray is drooling big spit balls Feeling cranky, logged all night Kids on coffee Where's my Bonus Cup?Come on man, fill me up I need some Krappers to wash it down Kids on coffee Kids on coffee Went driving down to San Diego Passing by the nuclear tits Go away off my earth!Kids on coffee Kids on coffee!The amount of actual sleep is now optional.<start>If there's somethin' you need

Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon my defenses
Softly, gently, night unfits its splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night
Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me
Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darkest side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night, of the night<start>You say sorry and walk away
And you go to face a problem
I can't stand in your way
You will lose and fall flat on your face
And when you do I'll still be here
Despite your disgrace

I'm sick of watching you try to fake it, yeah
Running Away
Running Away
Running Away
Whoa-oh
Running Away
Running Away
Running Away
Whoa-oh
Ask me now I know I can help
Don't walk away ashamed again
And beat up yourself
Why pretend that I cannot see
I can see your lack of faith
And know that you just don't trust me
My hand is here just take it
I'm sick of watching you try to fake it, yeah
Running Away

Like clouds in the sky
Love me when you're high
Leave me when you cry
I know it all
It takes time
Like a river running dry
When the sun's too bright
So long, this is goodbye
May we meet again in another life
Like strangers passing by
May we see it clearly in a different light
Keep touching lies
Like a thief in the night
The sun will rise
And expose all the lies
So why deny that you and I
Live different lives
The rivers from your eyes
Can't change my mind
So long, this is goodbye
May we meet again in another life
Like strangers passing by
May we see it clearly in a different light
The rivers from your eyes
Can't change my mind
So long, this is goodbye
May we meet again in another life
Like strangers passing by
May we see it clearly in a different light<start>Bury me in my boots and don't forget the whiskey
A lot of cigarettes, girl, you don't need to kiss me
Send me on my way with some black roses ???
And you can't go with me
I got a bible belt buckle on sand-washed cold blue jeans
Little scripture, little liquor, sometimes insane, sometimes it's mean
Hell, I'll always love you baby so that you just better believe
But that pine bass clock is ticking down on me
When I go, I wanna go out with style
Baby, don't you cry yeah
Bury me in my boots and don't forget the whiskey
A lot of cigarettes, girl, ain't no need to kiss me
Send me on my way with some black roses ???
And you can go with me ???
My hour glass was always half-empty
It's bound to be the bottle or the bullet that bit me
So when I'm gone, baby, you know just what to do
Bury me in my boots
And don't forget the whiskey
Don't dress me up like I'm going on Saturday night
Inviting all my rad friends to party and holler goodbye
When I'm walking on the hill, I just wanna look down
Seeing a hell of a party down south
So bury me in my boots and don't forget the whiskey
A lot of cigarettes, girl, ain't no need to kiss me
Send me on my way with some black roses ???
And you can go with me ???
My hour glass was always half-empty
It's bound to be the bottle or the bullet that bit me
So when I'm gone, baby, you know just what to do
Bury me in my boots
And don't forget the whiskey
Ohh, we all got to go sometime, yeah
When I go baby I wanna go down in style
Bury me in my boots and don't forget the whiskey
A lot of cigarette girl you don't need to kiss me
Send me on my way with some black roses ???
And you can go with me ???
My hour glass was always half-empty
It's bound to be the bottle or the bullet that bit me
So when I'm gone you know just what to do
Oh, I said when I'm gone, baby you know just what to do
Bury me in my boots

Are telling on you
More than a thousand words
Could ever do
Oh tattle tale tears
That you try to hide
Are telling that you're
The one who's crying inside
While you were pettin'
You kept forgettin'
With tables can turn
And that others
Can find someone new
Now you're alone
With no one to talk
And tattle tale tears
Are telling on you
While you were pettin'<start>Rain falling in a paper cup
Got her head turned down and her collar turned up
There's a sorrow in her eye and a sadness in her sigh
But she ain't gonna talk unless you come again, come again
Sitting on a curb in the afternoon
Watching colors dance around like her feet to a tune
You know she knows she knows she knows
There goes it goes it goes
You better come again
[Chorus]
I got a lot to learn baby
So please won't you teach me
I got a lot to learn baby
And everybody wants a shot at you darling
Oh she said
You can't help me if you've never been
Got my head filled up with the memories of everything
And I can never sleep 'cause the shuffle of the feet
Always pounding in my brain like a hurricane
Still I can see your open hand
If you can't let me near, then I can't help you stand
I've got nothing to complain about
Nothing I can shout about
Maybe I could bust you out
[Chorus]
And you don't care about tomorrow
You just stand out in the rain
And if you listen you can hear
That I'm the one whose got his hand out looking for a little change
[Chorus]
Oh, You look so good
[Chorus]<start>So many nights I lay awake
Can't sleep
I lay here thinkin' 'bout a woman
I used to love
Can't sleep but no good to count sheep
I'll just count the worries
That I've got plenty of
And how many times
Must I be the fool
Before I can make it
Oh make it on home
I've got to find a place to sing my words
Is there nobody listening to my song?
You talk about a life
Been searching for the key
But can't find an answer
To comfort me
I ask myself about love
Can't even find the door
To take me to a place
I've never seen before
But how many times
Must I be the fool
Before I can make it
Oh make it on home
I've got to find a place to sing my words
Is there nobody listening to my song?<start>It's all about steam
It's all about dreams
It's all about making the best out of everything
You'll know when your fine
Cause you'll talk like a mime
You'll fall on your face
You get back up and you're doing fine
"a considerate clown, a preachy preachy machine"
Is one of the sweetest things you would say about me
But I don't have the time for your distorted esteem
Why are you toying with my mind?
I don't wanna hear you say it
Now you're fucking with my pride
You think you're smarter than me
Well everyone knows you will never be smarter than me
That's how it goes
I gained forty pounds because of you
Was there an S on my chest
Well I confess, you were too much stress
I'd have a heart attack at best
So now I breathe it out, I breathe it out
I spit it on the crowd cause they lift me up, they lift me up, they lift me up
When I'm feeling down
What am I spitting out? spitting out, something we never talk about
It's called my mind
I don't wanna hear you say it
Now you're messing with my pride
I'm sick of standing in your line
So now you'll have to take it
Take this to heart
I will never let you fuck me over
Stop talking down to me your war is old
Your game is over
So here's my coldest shoulder
I don't wanna hear you say it
Now you're messing with my pride
Something we don't talk about
Something we never talk about<start>Everywhere we go we feel like we're strangers,
On the other hand it makes us feel major;

It's so wonderful (so wonderful).

Inhale, steamin',
We can blow it up for the weekend.
Shallow world, meet him,
Come and swim with us in the deep end.
Can't control the feelin',
And I can't let go, I need it.
Everywhere we go we feel like we're strangers,
On the other hand it makes us feel major;

(I need it) It's so wonderful,<start>Your legs don't work and you're caught in the light.
You can see through the walls so nothing is right.
There's a man in the cellar next door
And he's scratching the floor fifty miles away.
You didn't know him till today.
You're walking home and your heart has been drained.
But you're eyes have been newly trained.
And the roof is invisible now,
It's incredible how you were ever blind.
Now you will always find
Rooms are connected,
Eyes are perfected,
Hey now now hey now now you can see.
Something you shouldn't be ,
Something suddenly free,
What will happen now?
If the eyes are too strong,
The horizon's too long.
I can see I can see,
But mama says it's wrong.
In the night I'll lose it.
It's not right but I'll use it.
I can see I can see.
As my lungs fill with air,
The whole world is laid bare,
What will happen to me?
The warning says you can see
You will forever riddle.<start>I'm working day and night to find me my passage to write
I'm gonna get the next train going to be right by her side
Ooh oh ah kitty just you see
Don't put the blame on me, oh no
I want my baby back, oh no
I want my baby back
I tried to phone her but the cable was broke by a storm
Now I won't see her till tomorrow when night meets the dawn
Ooh oh ah kitty just you see
Don't put the blame on me, oh no
I want my baby back, oh no
I want my baby back
I'll buy her anything
A big fat car a diamond ring
If she will be my girl
I want her back I need you girl
I'm working day and night to find me my passage to write
I'm gonna get the next train going to be right by her side
Ooh oh ah kitty just you see
Don't put the blame on me, oh no
I want my baby back, oh no
I want my baby back, oh no<start>It's been a long time since I walked
Through this old town
But oh how the memories start to flow
And there's the old movie house
They finally closed it down
You could find me there every Friday night
Twenty years ago.
I worked the counter at the drugstore down the street
But nobody's left there I would know
On Saturday mornings that's where
All my friends would meet
You'd be surprised to know what a dime would buy
Twenty years ago.
[Chorus]
All my memories from those days come gather round me
What I'd give if they could take me back in time
It almost seems like yesterday
Where do the good times go?
Life was so much easier twenty years ago.
I guess I should stop by Mr. Johnson's hardware store
His only son was my friend Joe
But he joined the army back in 1964
How could we know he would never come back
Twenty years ago<start>(Intro)
(Verse1)
Beautiful girl that's who you are,
I coming down from the thousand stars, and even
when your heart is feeling low, i can give you
with all my hope. So prince charming if that's who
I am, I come to take you from a thousand plans.
And even if the world is getting old, the
politics never shuts us down.
(Chorus1)
We will fall in love, so lets share our
own fantasy and be willing tonight.
I will love you so, and if you care
about me tonight and ill be with you
forever now.
(Melody solo)
(Verse2)
I love you so if you love me now,
we start dancing as the night is young.
And if you understand the way I feel
my cold iron heart will never bleed.
(Repeat to chorus)
(Chorus 2)
If we start to fall in love, so let's start falling in love
and see how we live in a harmony.
(Bridge)
In harmony, in harmony ah ooh.
(Backup Chorus)
I love you, I need you.
(Outro)
I will be with you tonight, tonight.<start>This was once a city
Harmony a common theme
But these complications
Now make life a bit uneasy
This was once a city
Hallowed buildings, scrape the sky
Voices ride the airwaves
Once a city years gone by
Will they still be standing
In the centuries ahead
Going underground
Little children hiding
Bullets never meant for them
Must there be such bloodshed in our hearts
Our homes, our heads?
Will I be walking, walking so free?
This was a city once
This was once a city
Harmony a common theme
But these complications
Once a city, once a dream<start>If I trust myself, and in my strength
I'll be in the desert with nothing to drink
I'll live in the wilderness, so far and so alone
And I won't help myself, so hot and yet so cold
I choose not to lean on my own understanding
I acknowledge You in my ways and You direct me
I'll be like a tree by the river
When I put my trust in You
I'll be like a coal in the fire
When I put my hope in You
If my heart departs and I turn away
Then I will be cursed from the absence of my faith Lord without your help I'm drowning in the sea
And I won't help myself, I can't move and I can't breathe
I choose not to lean on my own understanding
I acknowledge You in my ways and You direct me
I'll be like a tree by the river
When I put my trust in You
I'll be like a coal in the fire
When I put my hope in You
I choose not to lean on my own understanding
I acknowledge You in my ways and You direct me
I'll be like a tree by the river
When I put my trust in You
I'll be like a coal in the fire
When I put my hope in You<start>Black angels spread their wings
And they swallow the sky
Carry my ghost to a hiding place
From cellophane smiles
And halos of barbwire
Fly me far from everything
From everyone and
Fly me away from myself
Tears of the crying Sun
Like despair on the wing
Swirl through the gray
like a cauldron achurn
For the Winter sky
Cry for the crows on the wire
For they fly no more
Take me far from everything
Everyone and
Take me away from myself
Far from you
Take me away from myself
Away from you
Silent like the January mist of morn
Skies adorned
Dressed in shadows dancing with the failing wind
But it's too late now
Too late now
Way too late
Too late
To make up for everything
Way too late
Too late
For taking back anything
Way too late
Too late
To cry for you
Way too late
Too late
To cry for myself
Black as the deepest night
As you fly on your way
Fly to my dreams
As you glide on the wings of my memory
Don't know where you're going
But please take me anyway
Take me far from everyone
And bid them all farewell
Take me far away from here
If you could only
Take me away from myself
Far from you
Take me away from myself
Away from you<start>I think the state of mind that I'm in
We should drop it right now
Well you've got yourself to blame
If you need these sunny days
And all those plans that I made
They're all changed by the end of the day
Cause God fucked up when he made us
Cause he made us so we could hate us
And the world could end in a second<start>Time and again I've longed for adventure,
Something to make my heart beat the faster.
What did I long for? I never really knew.
Finding your love I've found my adventure,
Touching your hand, my heart beats the faster,
All that I want in all of this world is you.
You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long.
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.
You are the angel glow that lights a star,
The dearest things I know are what you are.
Some day my happy arms will hold you,
And some day I'll know that moment divine,
When all the things you are, are mine!<start>A fool, I'm a fool
Fallin' in love like this
I shouldn't let myself
Run away with a dream like this
It started as a harmless game
But I was playin' with fire
And now so hopelessly
I can't stop my desire
(*) A fool, I'm a fool
Cause I'm in love with you
How could there be a chance
To make this love come through
A fool yes you are
I know that you are
I hope that you weren't
A fool like you are
Oh boy aren't you dumb
A fool that you are
A fool
I'm a fool
I gotta go through that pain
Of always wantin' you near
And wishin' you'd give me one look
That knows my heart and hears
* repeat
A fool, I'm a fool
Fallin' in love like this
I shouldn'a let myself
Run away with a dream like this
It started as a harmless game
But I was playin' with fire
And now so hopelessly
I can't stop my desire
A fool, I'm a fool
Fallin' in love like this
I shouldn'a let myself
Run away with a dream like this<start>I might else while we cheating on you I do
I might else while we cheating on you
Always knew that you would be
Cheating on me finally
I never knew it'd be this who
Didn't see it coming
Yesterday you let me down
The only friend I thought I found
Sleepless nights of harm and due
Baby who was kissing you
If this would have happened to me 10 years ago
I'd make sure that you'd be lying six feet underground
We little girls we grow up knowing love will find a way
So now we have an understanding, I can see why I
Might as well be cheating on you
I might as well do all the things you do
I might as well have a little fun
Baby you inspire, it's the way we carry on
Heavy steal is all you see
That is what is left of me
No remorse no dignity
Can we get any higher
To every other happy fool
His loyalty will come for you
Lights go out, on your own
So much pretending
Now, If this would have happened to me 10 years ago
I'd make sure that you'd be lying six feet underground
We little girls we grow up knowing love will find a way
So now we have an understanding, let's just rock' n' roll
I might as well be cheating on you
I might as well do all the things you do
I might as well have a little fun
Baby you inspire, it's the way we carry on, yeah yeah
Have you ever
Been in love before
And doesn't bother
Cause nothing ever seems to be the way to be
Tell me why won't you love me like the way you used to do
It might be working a while
So take a step back and ask yourself how
This is gonna last when it's all a lie
Hear me out
Swear to God that this is nothing now and don't forget
I might as well be cheating on you
I might as well do all the things you do
I might as well have a little fun
Baby you inspire, it's the way we carry on, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

She's not your thing
If you gotta talk about it
She's not your thing
If you gotta think about, talk about, call about, shout about it
Every time I walk without you
It's over at eight
Not a lot of talkin' at you
To fill the space
So If you wanna think about, talk about, call about it, shout about it -
Fight about it, sing about it, sulk about it, and live without it...
It's not your pretty face
That make my life so hard to take
It's not your pretty skin
Cuz its too thin.
If I gotta think about it -
She's not my thing<start>Here am I
Whole at last with a golden view
Looking for hope
And I hope it's you
Splitting my heart
Cracked right in two
The pleasure of pain endured
To purify our misfit ways
And magnify our crystal days
Where are you
In shadows only I can see
Looking for hope
And you hope it's me
Tattered and torn and born to be
Building a world where we can
Purify our misfit ways
And magnify our crystal days
Pure and to magnify
Here am I
Whole at last with a golden view
Looking for hope
And I know it's you
Splitting my heart
Cracked right in two
The pleasure of pain and joy
To purify our misfit ways
And magnify our crystal days
Purify our misfit ways
And magnify our crystal days

On we want to hold each other
Play us a groove so we hardly move
Just let our hearts be together
Oh baby 'cause it feels so good
When we're close like this
Whisper in my ear
And let me steal a kiss
Come on touch me when we're dancing
You know you've got that lovin' touch
Oh touch me when we're dancing
I want to feel you when I'm fallin' in love
Tonight's the night and it feels so right
What my heart's saying to me
You're the one and I've waited so long
So let your love flow through me
Oh baby 'cause it feels so good
We can be this close
You've got me up so high
I could fly coast to coast
Come on touch me when we're dancing
You know you've got that lovin' touch
Oh touch me when we're dancing
I want to feel you when I'm fallin' in love
Oh touch me when we're dancing

Feel you when I'm fallin' in love
Touch me when we're dancing
Touch me when we're romancing
Touch me when we're dancing<start>I'd go working in daytime
Instead of staying out all night
And if I felt bad and sick
I'd pretend I'm alright
Every day I'd bring you flowers
I'd go walking your dog
I would do it all right this time
I wouldn't mind doing the dishes
I would not let you wait
Would play your favourite records
And pretend they're just great
And if you like I'd sell my car
And ride a bike instead
I would do it all right this time
And I swear I'd still be right here in twenty-five years from now
And I'd mean it when I say I love you, and I'd let it show
Each day I'm alive I would only live to make you feel fine
All that and more I would do
If you were still mine...
I'd join you on those parties
And pretend I have fun
I'd see the bright side of things
Even if there is none
And I would swallow all my fear
To not make you concerned
I would do it all right this time
And when you're lying to yourself
I'd notice but wouldn't tell
Whenever you're fooling yourself
I'd let you fool me as well
So if my eyes were your mirror
I'd swear you'd like what you see
I would do it all right this time
And I swear I'd still be right here in twenty-five years from now
And I'd mean it when I say I love you, and I'd let it show
Each day I'm alive I would only live to make you feel fine
All that and more I would do
If you were still mine...<start>[studio demo from 1997, recorded during the making of the album ]

- john petrucci
I've got my hands out in front of my face
But I can hardly see
I've bathed myself in holy water
But it doesn't bother me
Under my skin, upon my head
Inside the walls, beneath my bed
My black and whites are turning red
Cover my eyes and tell me
Am I really blind
Cover my eyes and tell me
Have I lost my mind
I've got my fingers to the blade
But I can't feel a thing
Open my eyes in salty water
But it doesn't even sting
Under my skin, upon my head
Stuck in my throat, beneath my breath
My black and whites are turning red
Cover my eyes and tell me
Am I really blind
Cover my eyes and tell me
Have I lost my mind
Have I lost my mind
Have I lost my mind
Under my skin, upon my head
The lunatic is playing dead
My black and whites are turning red
Cover my eyes and tell me
Am I really blind
Cover my eyes and tell me
Have I lost my mind

Oh what's the use in trying
No one can mend you now
Love plays cruel games
You can't believe she's found another lover
"Does she miss me?"
Sometimes you just can't help but wonder
No, you can't hold the hands of time

The curtains flew then he appeared, saying don't be afraid
Come on baby, and she had no fear

Running through the crowds, he made it out alive.

She's driving down the shore on a Jersey afternoon.
She's driving down the same old road, her parents took her through.
Hypnotized by those broken lines, broken records lost in time.
She's turning down the road that is new, and she can't turn back.
No, she can't turn back!
She can't turn back.
Stepping through the darkness, it's a new day light.
Betting everything on herself tonight.
Tonight!
Stepping out of a Asbury Lanes in a midnight snow.
Standing in a missile town. Feels like it's coming alive
Riots and corruption, New Jersey roots!
These songs were the key to the engines of our growing up.
And we wanna say, thanks to the music in our lives,
forgive ourselves for all those lies.
Send some love to all the lonely,
Don't forget we're all one family.
Thanks to the music in our lives, for helping us to survive.
Lost in one lonely dream, born to run and LIVE FREE!
The sun shines brightly on us this afternoon.
Walking in our own footsteps, a search for something more.
We can't turn back.
No, we can't turn back!
We can't turn back.
Stepping through the darkness, into the light
We're betting everything, we're betting everything
We're betting everything! On ourselves tonight.

Swept on by the current of selfish ambition
Frightened ashamed and afraid of the blame

The sickness is growing distracted condition
You can feel the disgust and smell the confusion
Lying insane getting soaked in the rain
Draining the sky of the guilt and the shame
The nightmare is coming the clouds are descending
Pulled under two thousand meters a second
Clawing at walls that just slip through my fingers
Darkness consuming collapsing and breaking
Distilled paranoia seeped into the walls
And filled in the cracks with the whispering calls
Shadows are forming take heed of the warnings
Creeping around at four in the morning
Lie to myself start a brand new beginning
But I'm losing myself in this fear of living

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no<start>If I could make it rain today
And wash away this sunny day down to the gutter
I would just to get a change of pace
Things are getting worse, but I feel a lot better
And that's all that really matters to me
Well, Amy hit the atmosphere
Caught herself a rocket ride out of this gutter
And she's never coming back I fear
Anytime it rains she just feels a lot better
And that's all that really matters to me
We've waited so long
For someone to take us back home
It just takes so long
Meanwhile all the days go drifting away
And some of us sink like a stone
Waiting for mothers to come
There has to be a change I'm sure
Today was just a day fading into another
And that can't be what a life is for
And anything she said well she feels a lot better
And that's all that really matters to me
We've waited so long
For someone to take us back home
It just takes so long
Meanwhile all the days go drifting away
And some of us sink like a stone
Waiting for mothers to come
I want to know, I want to know,
I want to know, I want to know
I want to know, I want to know,
I want to know, I want to know
And all I really know is I want to know
And all I really know is I don't want to know
And all I really know is I want to know
And all I really know is I don't want to know [last two lines repeat]<start>I can't tell if this is real or if I am sleeping
I'll embroider the truth
And that's so I shall reap
I took things that didn't belong to me
I didn't mean to do you wrong
[Chorus]
Looking back on all that stolen time
Back when I was drinking turpentine
Don't blame me
I only took you in
It takes time to do the poisoning
So let's close the door on this and lock it
And that's all it will ever be
Just an accident of chemistry
You did everything to me but stopped short of murder
Couldn't move me much closer to keeping my word
While the crowds threw stones at the hangman
The sky fell down
The bells rang
[Chorus]
And that's all that it will ever be
Just an accident of chemistry
Airless shaft of an underground railway
Effete assassin with a hawk in a sack
The earth will offer us in when our hearts fail
As it swallowed the river running under the track
Under the track yeah
I can't tell if I'm dreaming or if I'll awaken
With a song in my heart that is longing to break
Let it out and let it fly high
Up where the spires scrape the sky
[Chorus]
And that's all that it will ever be
Just an accident of history
Yeah
Airless shaft of an underground railway
Cute assassin with a hawk in a sack
The earth will offer us in when our hearts fail
Swallowed the river running under the track
That's right<start>I don't know when it all began to simmer down,
But suddenly I don't want you around,
And I'm sitting here.
I'm drowning in the worry and the fear,
Cause I am starting to forget now,
It disappears so fast,
I'm waiting for the question to be asked,
And if you saw me now, you'd not be disappointed.
Some how I've gotten to the point,
I'm not ever comin back.
My minds made up I'm stayin' clear as long as it has taken
[Chorus]
To get close to you,
I want to get close to you and I need more time,
I want to get close to you,
I just want to get close to you and I'm not sure why.
Sometimes I, I get up in the morning so surprised,
Yeah it takes me some time to realize,
That lately I, lately I, have really wished that you were still around,
Here to pick me up off of the ground,
Cause I am starting to forget now,
It disappears so fast, I'm waiting for the question to be asked,
And if you saw me now, you'd not be disappointed.
Some how I've gotten to the point,
I'm not ever comin back.
My minds made up I'm stayin' clear as long as it has taken
[Chorus]
I'm losin' it, whoa, whoa, whoa
You make me sick, whoa, whoa, whoa
My minds made up I'm stayin clear as long as it has taken
[Chorus]<start>I'm a man of reason, and they say
"'Tis the season to be jolly but it's folly when you volley for position"
Never in existence has there been such a resistance
To ideas meant to free us
If you could see us, then you'd listen
Toiling through the ages, making toys on garnished wages
There's no union
We're only through when we outdo the competition
I make toys, but I've got aspirations
Make some noise, use your imagination
Girls and boys, before you wish for what you wish for
There's a list for who's been
Naughty or nice, but consider the price to an elf
A full indentured servitude can reflect on one's attitude
But that silly red hat just makes the fat man look outrageous
Absurd though it may seem, you know, I've heard there's even been illegal doping
And though we're coping, I just hope it's not contagious
You try to start a movement, and you think you see improvement
But when thrown into the moment, we just don't seem so courageous
I make toys, but I've got aspirations
Make some noise, use your imagination
Girls and boys, before you wish for what you wish for
There's a list for who's been
Naughty or nice, but consider the price to an elf
You look at yourself, you're an elf
And the shelf is just filled with disappointing memories
Trends come and go, and your friends wanna know
Why you aren't just happy making crappy little gizmos
Every kid knows they'll just throw this stuff away
We're used to repetition, so we drew up a petition
We, the undersigned, feel undermined
Let's redefine "employment"
We know that we've got leverage, so we'll hand the fat man a beverage
And sit back while we attack the utter lack of our enjoyment
It may be tough to swallow, but our threats are far from hollow
He may thunder, but if he blunders, he may wonder where the toys went
I make toys, but I've got aspirations
Make some noise, use your imagination
Girls and boys, before you wish for what you wish for
There's a list for who's been
Naughty or nice, but consider the price
Naughty or nice, but consider the price
Naughty or nice, but consider the price to an elf<start>When you can't find the hours
Days keep on slipping through
Avenues under construction
Blocking out your sky blues
burried beneath the letters
Bills and the junk in the mail
Finding the strain to your heart
From the troubles down the trail
no sign of your old haunts here
gone with the copper crews
Veins mined in vein remind you
Choices we choose to lose
new cities keep on sprawling
Old towns falling too
Raining a river of color
and it's flowing bisbee blue
straight to you bisbee blue
some say this way's the only one that's true
bring me back bisbee blue
Bring me back
oh these days, seem dark
darkest I've seen
darling you send me through the hours
days keep on sifting through
Chipping away to remember
days with you bisbee blue
Shining like bisbee blue
Bring me back bisbee blue<start>It's how high you are
And the time it takes to heal
It's how high you are
And the time it takes to heal
I can climb a tree and push up through the leaves
'Cause only when I try, am I happier to see
My head's in some kind of space
Where boyhood, boyhood used to be
It's how high you are
And the time it takes to heal
It's how high you are
And the time it takes to heal
But it's all a lie and I've never felt so sad
An' there's a streak of melancholy, it's runnin' down my back
And there's a great mistrust that boarders 'round the man
I call it strange from a boy who's never left his head
It's how high you are
And the time it takes to heal
It's how high you are
And the time it takes to heal
Heal
Ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, yaa
Everyone needs someone to live by
Everyone needs someone to live by
Everyone needs someone
Everyone needs someone to live by
Everyone needs someone
Everyone needs someone

It's how high you are

You can't lie still in the guest house bed
There's a pair of black eyes staring down at you
From the mountain top, through y'r window
The bunks are empty, your mates are gone
Breakfast lasts an hour long
O warm bread, drawn tea
The bastards'll never get to me
But somebody knows, somebody knows
Somebody always knows
Where a body goes
I were one of two, we were joined at the shoe
When we thought to make our break
So we shimmied our locks and we knocked up a box
And we rode the thing down the waterway
Now the Derwent twists and the Derwent slides
It's a moving thing with many eyes
O who'd have thought, at all or often
That vehicle would become our coffin?
So many souls, so many souls
So many souls in the water
I left me a little daughter and I left me a girl
And I left them alone in that tired old world
O where are they now?
I am one of a gang set to work on the land
A clearin' and fellin' and killin'
The best of us here has a conscience clear
And he goes about it keen and willin'
We're shooting them from the rocks
And we're shooting them in the water
And when they're runnin' we're shootin' them in the backs
And we do it without a thought or care?
So many lies, so many lies, so many lies been told
We'll none of us here grow old
Not gracefully, not peacefully in this blind old land
In this dreaming land, some demon's land<start>Sue, I got the job
We'll buy the house
You'll need to rest
But now we'll make it
Sue, the clinic called
The x-ray's fine
I brought you home,
I just said home
Sue, you said you wanted writ
"Sue the virgin" on your stone
For your grave
Why too dark to speak the words?
'Fore I know that you have a son
Oh, folly, Sue
Ride the train, I'm far from home
In a season of crime none need atone,
I kissed your face
Sue, I pushed you down beneath the weeds,
Endless faith in hopeless deeds,
I kissed your face
I touched your face
Sue, goodbye
Sue, I found your note
That you wrote last night
It can't be right
You went with him
Sue, I never dreamed
I'm such a fool
Right from the start
You went with that clown<start>.

Told I ain't enough
Done a lot of hard livin' in a world that's sometimes cold
I been pitched and taken in
My future's looking grim
Somehow I disconnected along that road
But try as I may
I can never be the same
This time I'm here to stay
Ricochet
Seen the walking side of death
The eyes that never rest
Been waiting in a line for the call that never comes
But kid, don't hold your breath
You're only second best
Ain't personal just business being done
With a paralyzing gaze
I walked onto the stage
Could I really be the outcast coming home

The way you've fallen too

Now's the time for us to rise
And carry hope to hopeless eyes
And show this world that mercy is alive

To hear your name on lips across the world
We will run in the wake of your love

And carry hope and let love shine

To the ice rink
The back of your skidoo made me all wet
(From snow)
You'd pat me on the head as we stole
Your dad's Chevrolet, one more time
I bought new hiking boots
So you'd think I was cool
(You didn't care, cause you never knew I was alive)
I never wanted anything
The way I wanted you, that night
My love transcended space and time
I never wanted anything
The way I wanted you, that night
My love transcended space and time
My first
You used to ride yer red and white dirt bike
I'd hold yer jacket close to my heart so tight
My mom woke me up, early and said,
"Look what yer friends did to my front yard!"
It was me and my sisters, out my window
There it was!
There, baby!
You peed my name in the snow!
I never wanted anything
The way I wanted you that night
My love transcended space and time
I never wanted anything
The way I wanted you that night
My love transcended space and time
My first
(Meet me in the school yard, after eight
Still grounded, I couldn't stay out late
Remember all the things you said
In the back of that Chevrolet
When we were only fifteen?)
My daddy moved us to a big city
Yer smiling face, I never again did see no more
I wonder how you are, and I wonder
If you think about me still
Would you guess what I'm doing?
You and yer friends
I want you to remember that you were my first
We are lucky to have something to eat
Everything happens for a reason,
And that's good to remember
'Cause the music business is really, really weird.<start>Yeah, yeah
The blood in my veins was runnin' right through my brain
There was a cop with a gun
Who was runnin' around insane
Three fifty arrests
No bullet proof vest
Now ain't that a shame
We wanted to play
Play for the crowd
Law said no way
Cause you're on your way out
Bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium
The place was a jumpin'
And the booze was going down
There's a curfew at ten
And you been working overtime
We don't play just for pay
So we'd like to stay
Stay just the same
He gave me a crack in the back with his gun
Hurt me so bad I could feel the blood run
Bedlam in Belgium
It was bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium
Came for a good time and left on the run
Bedlam in Belgium, yeah
Who's to blame
It's a shame
Bedlam
In Belgium
It was bedlam
Getting ready
Stayed on the stage cops in a rage
Crowd yelled for more it was war, war, war
Bedlam in Belgium
It was bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium
Came for a good time and left on the run
Bedlam in Belgium<start>It's a love song to the self
A story recapped every day
It's a world of bogus feelings
And a world of slow decay
It's a world of laughter hidden by this world of fear and torment
A game of strange compulsion, our visceral convulsion
Anxiety for love of life
Anxiety for pain
Anxiety, a feeling that you know you can't contain
Anxiety destroys us but it drives the common man
Foundation of society
Anxiety
Suppress it if you can
The caste of coffee-achievers didn't perform like they planned
The morning rush hour traffic is our play of false elan
So run around your frantic track and lay you down to sleep
Tomorrow's the redemption
We strive for that exception
Anxiety for love of life
Anxiety for pain
Anxiety, a fear that you have nothing more to gain
Anxiety destroys us but it drives the common man
Foundation of society
Anxiety
Suppress it if you can
What are we angry for?
We all need a common cure
That common goal for which you strive
To have more than the other guy
The quest for the truth
The quest for the gold
We end up all the same
The common lie
The righteous cry
We end up all the same
The angry crowd
Those lost and found
Everybody's all the same
The poet's pen
These words I lend
We all bend to anxiety<start>Come on, let your light shine
Let your light shine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Come on, let your light shine
Let your light shine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Your love can make us run
Run to the broken
Your love can give us strength
To love our enemies
It shatters all our pride and insecurity
Your love brings the wall of hatred to its knees
We believe
We believe in a love unending
We believe in a light that fills the night
We believe only He can bring our hearts to life
Your love can break through hearts
Hardened from defeat
And in the raging flood
A shelter for the weak
We want to feel Your move
In ways we have never dreamed
Illuminate each step
Beyond what we can see
We believe
We believe in a love unending
We believe in a light that fills the night
We believe only He can bring our hearts to life
We believe there's a day that's coming
When everything that is wrong will be made right
We believe we will see Him
Bring our hearts to life

As I sit and stare through my window
I look out
At a world that's tearing apart
This is what I see
And what do you see?
Time goes by
And the times get worse
Through my window
Still I watch
As the madness darkens the heart
This is what I see.
And what do you see?
Tell me how do we live in a world
That is crumbling away--
And be happy
As we are today?
Still I watch
As I pin my hopes on the future
Still I wait
Wond'ring what in heaven will be--
Is this an ending
Or a beginning
That I see?
And what do you see?
And at times it appears that our happiness
Hangs by a thread
Can we hold on
Through what lies ahead?
People say
I should turn away
From the window
All the worry
In all the world doesn't pay
And still I wonder
What kind of future
Starts this way?
For you...
And me....
And what do you see?<start>I wish I had Paul Newman's eyes
And every day came with some surprise
I wish I had Paul Newman's eyes
That would be nice
Look at those houses, big houses over there
Look at those suits spending money without a care
Here comes the stars with perks around their arms
Here comes the sports car that carries so much ch-ch-charm
Ch-ch-charm
But I'm just a nothing that doesn't have a lot
And I asked for your life but look at what I got
So sick of seeing, don't want to hear no more
And you can amputate my limbs
And starve me to death whilst I beg for freedom
Away from a life which is this
But I wish I had Paul Newman's eyes
And every day came with some surprise
I wish I had Paul Newman's eyes
That would be nice
Ooh, look at those setters, those setters of the trend
Look at that band, they act so confident
Here comes the movies with dialogue so cool
Why did they never tell me to speak like that that in primary school
So sick of seeing, don't want to hear no more
And you can amputate my limbs
And starve me to death whilst I beg for freedom
Away from a life which is this
But I still wish I had Paul Newman's eyes
And every day came with some surprise
I wish I had Paul Newman's eyes
That would be nice
So sick of seein', can't stand to talk
And I've no compassion or thought
But I wish I had Paul Newman's eyes
And every day came with some surprise
I wish I had Paul Newman's eyes
That would be nice<start>When I was a kid, I had a little record
I played it over and over, each and every day
Sung by a man, named Louie Armstrong
Saint's marched right in from my Close and Play
When I was a kid, I had a little picture
And I looked at that picture all the time
Painted by a man, Mama said his name was Vinnie
A farmer sowing seeds on a really nice day
Mom and daddies get a good idea what your babies like
To help 'em be happy like that guy named Mike
Yeah, that groovy old man that fixes my bike
Down there on 'Dumaine Street, New Orleans Louisiana
When I was a kid, I had a little Wiener dog
I loved that little wiener dog and she loved me
Spent warm spring days feeding that little Wiener dog
Ripe sweet cherries from our cherry tree
An' if I ever get older, if I ever die
If I get to a gate at the end of the sky
And a beautiful creature says, "Now Bonnie what do you want?"
Might say a record and a picture and a wiener dog, swear to God
Mom and daddies get a good idea what your babies want
To help 'em be happy like that ol' gal named Betty
Yeah, that groovy old chick teaches Tai-Chi on the levee
Rain or shine she's out there she's dedicated
She's wrinkled but she's lovely
She's flexible and don't you wish
We all were flexible enough to dance now?
Dance little children now
The whole round world is your neighborhood
Dance little children now
Nekkid as a Jaybird
Dance little children now
The whole round world is your neighborhood
Dance little children now
Nekkid as a Jaybird
They're just trinkets
Little stepping stones
To let you know you was here<start>I don't know why but I'm tired of my mind
Pain is over me, overloading
I don't know why but you're trying to be kind
Take off your silver smile, throw your head back
And cry
I don't believe but I'm trying to decide
Which game is best for me, which can I bare
You don't perseve so I'm leading you away
Home were you've never been, non-returning
So cry
Throw a rock upon the road and it breaks into pieces
Shake brach upon the snow and the sun is defeated
Pull the curtains on yesterday and it seems so much later
Put a bullet in my brain and I'll make all the papers
I don't know why but I'm tired of my life
The clouds are in my eyes, overtaking<start>in love with myself that night
trying to forget/forgive
blinded by the bright white light
times up, place a bet
I said what I said
it made sense in my head
stay quiet instead
Im waiting for the wheels to turn
Im waiting for myself to learn
still waiting for the house to burn
Im waiting still
it feels alright
but Im not trying to hurt myself
Im going backwards
Im going back to the place I left behind
when I was a boy
Im going forwards
Im going for all the things you said I had
when I was a boy<start>You loved me and you made me what I am today
You loved me and you gave in every single way
You loved me and you gave it all so tenderly
You loved me and I?m a telling you now on bended knee
I'm a leavin' you baby
Mmm yeah
I'm a leavin' you baby
I was dirty and you took me home and washed my face
I was nowhere and you gave me a home and a restin' place
I was nothing and you gave me something to live for
I was nowhere
I wanna tell you now like never before
I'm a leavin' you baby
I'm a leavin' you baby
Oh yeah
I was dirty and you took me home and washed my face
I was nowhere and you gave me a home and a restin' place

Time and time await
Baby

I'm a leavin' you baby
Hey Hey

I can't stop the tears that you cry
But I got to say good bye
Oh baby
I'm a leavin' you ma ma ma ma
Oh oh leavin' you baby
Mmm<start>Sometimes I can't help but worship you
I love you and all the things that you do
I thought I'd sit and write this song just for you
To let you know that I am thinking of you
When I come home so cold at night
You'll have the fireplace burning bright
Thoughts of how it's going to be
And how I'll spend those cold, cold nights warm by you
And in these autumn days
I wander through the leaves
Thinking of those winter nights
I'll spend with you
And when I come home so cold at night
You'll have the fireplace burning bright
Thoughts of how it's going to be
And how I'll spend those cold, cold nights warm by you<start>There's a train a comin'

Dread and fascination
Run down to the station
Don't you want to ride her

Down in the back room we know so well
Southside of Austin
Where these blackout monkeys woke-up often
In a dirty saloon, yes
The room is a mess
Where the girls are over thirty and the boys overdressed
On the stage played a man they'd call Mr. Orson Brawl
And his band The Stool Pigeons
They got that bar room floor freaking
And now the floorboards are creaking
And the men wanna kill him
Because their women are peaking only when they call
Mr. Orson Brawl
you had it ah-ah-all

Mr. Orson Brawl

you had it ah-ah-all

He threw the false prophet down the wishing well
Oh well
Yes he threw the false prophet down the wishing well
Oh well,oh well
Now we're talking in dollars and cents
E Pluribus Unum is
From many we've come
And from many we went
But that's all done son
And you got her pregnant
Mr. Orson Brawl
You had it ah-ah-all
You had it ah-ah-all

Mr. Orson Brawl
You had it ah-ah-all

He had a daughter
Oh, he had a daughter
What a beautiful baby girl
He had a daughter
He had a daughter
What did he call her?
His baby girl
He had a daughter
He had a daughter
Heaven laughing the day she was born
He had a daughter
He had a daughter
He had a daughter and he called her rock'n'roll
She'd say hey big daddy (hey big daddy)
He'd say hey there little daughter
She'd say hey big daddy (hey big daddy)
He'd say hey there little daughter
She'd say hey big daddy (hey big daddy)
He'd say hey there little daughter
She'd say I love you daddy (I love you daddy)

Plunder and pillaging the seven seas
I'm a Celt in defial
To the invasion of my Celtic Isles
I'm the Teuton, the Germanic one
Uniting my tribes against the Hun
I'm a vandal, a Visigoth
Giving Atilla all I've got
It's all in the name of honor
Something many don't understand
I would choose death before dishonor
Because I am a fighting man
I'm the sacred order, in a holy fight
Protector of the Grail, the Templar knight
I am a prince, forged in fire
Defending my nation from the Ottoman Empire
I am the minute man, the patriotic creed
Fighting for freedom against tyranny
I am Hussar, I ride on a horse
Through the valley of death is my course
It's all in the name of honor
Something many don't understand
I would choose death before dishonor
Because I am a fighting man
I'm the Free Corp, my shirt is brown
Smashing the Reds in every town
I'm the storm trooper, a knight in black
Defender of Berlin in the final attack
I'm the new warrior, stark and mean
I stand faithful with my head shorn clean
I'm the guiding light in the final hour
Come follow me, I've got the power
It's all in the name of honor
Something many don't understand
I would choose death before dishonor
Because I am a fighting man
It's all in the name of honor
Something many don't understand
I would choose death before dishonor
Because I am a fighting man<start>Turning over again, here for another day,
Still the thoughts of a dream, fragments you cant escape,
i wont let you down, wont let you down
i wont let you down
victoria
lets take it from the start
back to the beginning
victoria
i cant breathe when were apart
without you theres, nothing without you
standing out in the rain, watching the traffic slow
as the light begins to fade your warmed by the city glow
i wont let you down, wont let you down
i wont let you down,

lets take it from the start, back to the beginning
victoria
cant breathe when were apart, without you theres, nothing without you

Turning over again, healed for another day

back to the beginning

cant breathe when were apart
without you theres nothing, without you.<start>[Instrumental]<start>I remember thinking murder in the car
Watching dogs somersault
Through sprinkles on tiny laws
I remember the graffiti, we are your children
Coming in with spray cans of paint
I remember the sunset and the plains of cement
And the way the nights seems to turn the color
of orangeade
In this town cellular phones are hot with thieves
In this town we all go to terminal pubs
It helps us sweat out those angry bits of life
From this town the English Army grind
Their teeth to glass
You'll get kicked tonight
Smell of puke and piss
Smell of puke and piss on your stilettos
Here comes the panic attack
My heart stops then starts
Give me a drink
I'll drink your round
I'll take you round the pole
It's cold up here
You'll catch the flu or you'll catch the city
Either way, you'll catch the flu
Or you'll catch the city<start>Lying 'round home alone
On a rainy night like this
Starving for your love
Hungry for just one kiss
Every raindrop I hear
Against my window pane
Speaks so loud and clear
Oh Lord, spells out your name
Got nowhere to turn, tired of being alone
Feel like breakin' up somebody's home
I know it's useless
Hanging on when you belong to someone else
Can't control the feelin'
'Cause after all, I didn't make myself
Last night, I cried so hard
I believe I caught a chill
Can't stand the vibration
And oh, my heart just won't stand still
Got nowhere to turn, tired of being alone
Feel like breakin' up somebody's home
Got nowhere to turn, tired of being alone
Feel like breakin' up somebody's home
I know it's useless
Hanging on when you belong to someone else
Can't control my feelin'
'Cause after all, I didn't make myself
Got nowhere to turn, tired of being alone
Feel like breakin' up somebody's home
Got nowhere to turn, tired of being alone
Feel like breakin' up somebody's home
Got nowhere to turn, tired of being alone
Feel like smashin' up somebody's home
Feel like breakin' up somebody's home<start>As I walk through
This wicked world
Searchin' for light in the darkness of insanity.
I ask myself
Is all hope lost?
Is there only pain and hatred, and misery?
And each time I feel like this inside,
There's one thing I wanna know:
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding? Ohhhh
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding?
And as I walked on
Through troubled times
My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes
So where are the strong
And who are the trusted?
And where is the harmony?
Sweet harmony.
Cause each time I feel it slippin' away, just makes me wanna cry.
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding? Ohhhh

So where are the strong?

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes and she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Oh
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking-horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds and you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Oh
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds and you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Oh
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking-glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Oh
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (oh, Lucy)

Where everything I do is flipped
And awkwardly reversed
You're seldom known and barely missed
I always put myself
In destructive situations
I need oxygen
To be exposed where no one goes, where no one's been
When it all comes crashing
Now we've got a big, big
Mess on our hands tonight. (sing it)
Now we've got a big, big
Mess on our hands tonight.
Somebody get my phone
So I can throw it in a public
Pool and watch it float
And as it slowly sinking down,
Become a social ghost
Inside a box, cut at the top
To let some light shine in
To remind me what I've done and where I've been
When it all comes crashingÃÂ¢? Â¦
Now we've got a big, big
Mess on our hands tonight. (sing it)
Now we've got a big, big, big, big
Mess on our hands, on our hands.
Don't give in, don't give up,
I'll be gone.
You don't look innocent enough.
We're too young to be critics
We won't miss anything at all
Don't give in, don't give up
I don't look innocent with this big big mess on,
I'll say something else.
Oh, we've got a big, big mess,
Oh, we've got a big, big mess,

We won't wish any harm at all
Don't give in, don't give up
No one looks innocent with this big big mess on our hands tonight.
When it all comes crashing.<start>we're never responsible
we lie as much as possible
pay no mind to politics
don't bother us with logic
risk and gamble others lives
we'll spin the wheel and roll the dice
break our backs to bend the truth
the kids will pay the price
we'll force them to play nice
blameshifters blame
believe all what we've been told
we keep our faith incased in gold
take our art as literal
our last words are final
we're never responsible
amoral, uncorrectable
farmed like sheep and worked like whores
it happens over time
accept it and deny it<start>Don't Cry elena
I'll come back to you
I'll have such lonely nights
Till this war is through
Dont Cry Elena
Try to understand
Whatever happens now
is guided by Gods hand
ahhh hhh ahhh ahh
They say I haven't longed to live
but they don't know
My will is strong
Because I love you so

Say a prayer for me
I'd like to come back soon
But that's not up to me.
No thats not up to me

The God of emperor deliverer of rakis
Stages his royal ascent
For the time has come for the tyrant
To unleash the golden path
The lease of their lives has been spent
Revealing shadows of his past
Taking charge of his own life
Distant to all mortal eyes
Never again the tyrant
The shock, the awe, the elation
[chorus:]
There is no time, no distance ahead to continue
The fixity of visions determined
As God of emperor seizes thy infinite grace
Transcending mystic worlds and time
Rage and confusion...war for supremacy
Valuable insight producing effect
As he marches down the royal road
His entourage embraces
Never again
The shock!
The awe!
The elation!
As arrakis undergoes a ghostly shift
The lessons now learned
Capturing reality
As the long awaited sacrifice unfolds
The march of the tyrant will end.
[chorus]<start>Have you ever hear of Gide?
I won't advise, it's full of lies
Trust me, I know 'cos I believed it so
What was I supposed to do?
Turn my back?
Well, that would lack
A certain amount of happiness
No doubt it's brutal and cruel and inevitable
It's not my fault so I don't care anymore
I'm packing up and moving out
And it's alright 'cos I'll be miles away
Trying to find new things to say, to say
Take me home and tuck me in
Hold me tight and I just might tell you all I know
(I'm feeling pretty low)
Sunglasses and handkerchiefs
I'm chronicling everything that's happened to us
So hate me if you must
It's easy to do so easy to do, yeah
And so convenient
It's all my fault though I don't care anymore
I'm packing up and moving out
And it's alright 'cos I'll be miles away
Trying to find new things to say

Outside my window is a tree.
There only for me.
And it stands in the gray of the city,
No time for pity for the tree or me.
There is a world of pain
In the fallinf rain
Around me.
Is there a reason for today?
Is there a reason for today?
Do you remember?
I can hear all the cries of the city,
No time for pity for a growing tree.
There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me.
Outside my window is a tree.
Outside my window is a tree.
There only for me.
And it stands in the gray of the city,
No time for pity for the tree or me.
There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me.<start>I've waited all night for this moment
To watch the day kiss the darkness goodbye
And I barely remember falling asleep
But the minute I open my eyes
Every dream comes true
When I look at you
I see heaven
I see an angel
Lying here next to me
Bring out the best in me
Hearts entangled, wrapped in forever
This close together
Me holding you, you holding me
You opened my eyes, baby I see
Heaven
I reach up to open the window
Let the cool air dance its way through
The sun and the sky is so blindingly bright
But it doesn't compare to you
Girl, I'm lost in time
As I watch you shine
I see heaven
I see an angel
Lying here next to me
Bring out the best in me
Hearts entangled, wrapped in forever
This close together
Me holding you, you holding me
You opened my eyes, baby I see
Heaven
I see heaven
I see an angel
Lying here next to me
Bring out the best in me
Hearts entangled, wrapped in forever
This close together
Me holding you, you holding me
You opened my eyes, baby I see

Taking her time as she [drives on] the ground,
Oh she is the queen of the non-fucking zone,
She is aware of the [bite] of the ground.<start>Mankind has always wondered about the kind of universe it lives in.
Mankind has always indulged in creation myths as far back as recorded history goes,
And it's just human nature to want to understand the universe we live in,
Where it came from, what it is now and where it's going
With all apologies you wake me up
You hold the porcelain to take me home
Hold my hand until the waves come
Hold my hand until the waves come
This is our last, take care love
It won't stop, it won't stop a thing
With all apologies you wake me up
You hold the porcelain to take me home
Hold my hand until the waves come
The waves come
Just hold my hand until the waves come
The waves come around
Well, the Einstein equations are sort of the Mount Everest of theoretical physics,
And, you know, we want to get to the top,
We want to be able to make Einstein's equations routine to solve.
We would like to have undergraduates be able to solve Einstein's equations routinely.
Might as well have grade school kids doing it because, you know, the physics is intuitive.
Grade school kids know about black holes and they might want to know 'Gosh,
What happens if I drop a black hole into a black hole'<start>It was a long hot summer day
We're in the living room watching the light drain away
Hey you're too tired to read what your cards foretold inside of a yawn
When she said, "The first time you show me your true heart I'll be gone"
I'll be gone, I'll be gone
I'll be gone, I'll be gone
The numb ringing after the bell was rung
Playing red light, green light, such timeless fun
And there was no way to kick start any conversation
It was like the beginning of 2001, when she said
"I'll be gone, I'll be gone
I'll be gone, I'll be gone"
The air isn't moving and the women have nothing on their lips
But the kind of breath that you keep for the hospital bed
Pregnant with the timeless drop and the wind
The air leeches the gold out of everything elusive but stolen, but stolen
I'll be gone, I'll be gone
I'll be gone, I'll be gone
I'll be gone, I'll be gone<start>I get into the car
Turn the radio up real far
To shut out the noise
So I can hear my voice
There's a party on down the street
But nobody invited me and I got a gig
Babysitting my uncle's kids
Why me, I just wanna see
Don't you know that I'm a hip hop queen
A rock and roll dream it's all bling bling
I'm the star on the scene
Yeah, check me out see what I'm all about
I'm the one that you want the one you can't have
The girl that you call who doesn't ever call back
Just look at me I've got everything
But then I woke up
I was lying on the couch
Drool coming out my mouth
Turned on the TV
Dr. Phil won't you please fix me
I'm waiting for the phone to ring
Flipping through a magazine
Why doesn't he call
Guess I'm the loser down the hall
Why me, I just wanna see
Don't you know that I'm a hip hop queen
A rock and roll dream it's all bling bling
I'm the star on the scene
Yeah, check me out see what I'm all about
I'm the one that you want the one you can't have
The girl that you call who doesn't ever call back
Just look at me I've got everything
But then I woke up
But then I woke up
I'm like living in a dream (I'm like living in a dream)
It's everything it's supposed to be (Supposed to be)
It's a holiday from me
It's all just kickin' in
And this is where I begin
Just being me
It's okay to be me
But it's gonna to be a a hip hop queen
A rock and roll dream it's all bling bling
Yeah, baby ka-ching
Come check me out
You know I'm bringin' down the house
I'm the one that you want you now I'm heaven sent
I'm a little skater boy and a little 50 Cent
Just look at me I've got everything
But then I woke up

son los suspiros que dio Dios.
Los claveles de Granada
son los rubes que llor.
Por la noche las estrellas
se los quieren llevar,
y la luna, vigilante,
no se va.
En las torres de la Alhambra
cada noche se ve
con mantilla plateada
y un clavel.
Los claveles de Granada
son porcelanas que El dej.
Los claveles de Granada
los encendieron con el sol.
En su rojo y amarillo
tienen la dignidad,
porque forman
la bandera nacional.
Y con ellos van unidos
todo buen espaol,
defendiendo con su vida
su color.
Qe maravillosos
son los tallos del clavel,
porque se parecen
al de la mujer.
Ser mujer de Espaa
es al tiempo ser clavel.
La mujer de Espaa
de claveles tiene el alma llena,
por ser mujer.<start>Outside the sky is water color grey
Newspaper says to look for rain today
No one around for company
And so I turn to memories to pass the time away
Each face that flashes back to mind
Seems as it was untouched by time
I can't recall quite all the names
Each one is precious all the same
How strange to think
How many friends were lost somewhere behind
[Chorus]
Where are they now
How I miss those companions
Who walked the canyons of the night
By my side
Where are they now
Like so many crazy dancers
We live only for the answers in a song
But that was long ago
Where are they now
When love was new and wonderful
There was no word impossible
The future we saw with our minds
Was something of our hearts design
Between today and yesterday
Life came between us all
[Chorus: x2]
Where are they now<start>To dream a dream
Is dangerous it seems
To hold yourself to the light
To fill your needs
Don't blow us up
That's so messed up
To hold yourself to the light
For the need to be seen
She staggers on
Still on her feet
You can take on the world
But she won't be beat
To dream a dream
Is dangerous it seems
To hold yourself to the light
To feel the enemy
You blew us up
That's so messed up
You held yourself to their light
For the need to be seen
She staggers on
Still on her feet
You can take her down
But she won't be beat<start>I've been dreaming of a red bird
And the peace of its gentle wings
It's an omen of better things
I've been waking with the same pain
That makes me want to sleep
And dream of a red bird
So build us a nest, for I've chosen to leave
For I am so so heavy here
Come to me tonight and I'll be waiting
With my wings
I will of left the weight behind me that
The blood of men brings
Where there once was despair
Tonight I will be free
And the slings and the stones that uncovered
My bones will have flown my memory
I've been dreaming of a red bird
It sings of a way out, it sings of release
It's been tapping on my window
To remind me it's waiting
And that I have a choice
So build us a nest, for I've chosen to leave
For I am so heavy here
Take me away from here
I am not equipped for such strain
Take away the fear
How do you prepare for the pain
Now I'm leaving with the red bird
And as my arms leak again
I am so happy here<start>{J.G. Thirwell)
The SNOT-GREEN sea - the SCROTUM-TIGHTENING sea
Cast thine bread upon the water - the SALTY water of the BRINY DEEP
Eternal backstroke in the vasty deep of the ocean of fire and brimstone
Looking at a haunted void - I'm all at sea, flat on thine back
As buoyant as the Titanic fifty years on so COME ON, Neptune, DRAG ME DOWN
Tadpole in the dead dead sea - FIREWATER! FIREWATER!
That drip drip drip is making me sick/That drip drip drip is making me sink
I'm condemned to eternal WATER TORTURE
This time the decider has shown no quarter
I just had a backyard coathanger job from the SINNER SORTER, SOUL ABORTER
Fire and water, firewater, water torture, WATER TORTURE
I could walk on water 'til I landed in strife now I'm treading water
NOW I SWIM FOR MY LIFE
My wetsuit's got a hole in it's pocket
Stuck my wet to in a live hot socket
STUCK MY WET TOE IN A LIVE HOT SOCKET, WET TOE IN A LIVE HOT SOCKET
Water everywhere can't see the horizon... can't even be WASHED UP or BEACHED
Not even a TERN to keep my eyes on... I shouldn't've practised what BEELZEBUB
Preached...
I'm condemned to eternal WATER TORTURE
This time the decider has shown no quarter
I just had a backyard coathanger job from the SINNER SORTER, SOUL ABORTER
FIRE AND WATER FIREWATER WATER TORTURE WATER TORTURE!!!
Must've bought my life from a used car salesman... only one previous owner
I must've bought my life from a used car salesman... one previous owner...
A little old lady... wish she'd driven it to church on Sunday
Four flat tyres - break an AXLE one day
That drip drip drip is making me sick/That drip drip drip is making me sink
That drip drip drip is making me drink/That drip drip drip is making me sick
I'm condemned to eternal WATER TORTURE
This time the decider has shown no quarter
I JUST HAD A BACKYARD COATHANGER JOB FROM THE SINNER SORTER, SOUL
ABORTER
FIRE AND WATER FIREWATER WATER TORTURE WATER TORTURE!!!
WATER TORTURE WATER TORTURE WATER TORTURE WATER TORTURE<start>I used to be (used to be) so in control
But reality (reality)'s losing its hold
Now I don't know where to begin
Just look at the state that I'm in
My mind is in total decay
I'm coming to take you away
[Chorus]
There's nothing more that I can do
(This maniac's in love with you)
Your biggest fear has just come true
(This maniac's in love with you)
There's nothing more that I can do
(this maniac's in love with you)
I want to cum inside of you.
My heart has been strapped in a straitjacket
The therapy boys say it fits like a glove
I'm crossing the line in my brain
The line between pleasure and pain
It takes all I've got to survive
This madness will eat me alive
[Chorus]
Now I just don't know where to begin
Just look at the state that I'm in
My mind is in total decay
I'm coming to take you away
[Chorus]
There's nothing more that you can do,..
Your biggest fear has just come true<start>Up high in a mansion
On a mountain of jagged rock
Behind two iron doors
So heavy they need no lock
Is the last place that love lives
Where the sad woman cries
Is the last place that love lives
Behind your eyes
You hold up your finger
And you place it to my lips
And you tell me that anger
Can never get rid of this
Is the last place that love lives
Where the sad woman cries
Is the last place that love lives
Behind your eyes
Never blind to misfortune
Never deaf to the sorrowful moan
Set adrift on an ocean
Until I find that peaceful shore
Is the last place that love lives
Where the sad woman cries
Is the last place that love lives
Behind your eyes<start>On the trail I chase tomorrow
Can you catch me to tame the ride?
I'm not fair about tomorrow
Then you forfeit your own hand
I see the light, I trail the light, I know the light
Can you will the right, as you place the time?
And your rules are blind, as you force me to loathe it
I'm not wild about tomorrow
I just live for a moments time
Got this place inside tomorrow
I can't get there you know it
I see the light, I trail the light, I know the light
Can you will the right, as you place the time?
And your rules are blind, as you force me to loathe it
(What's your case, what's your fuckin' deal?)
Oh, I'm not a member of society?
(Ripping face as you grip your stay)
It's not avenging enough to try
(Watch the gates as I spin my wheels)
Ooh, I'm in a hot rod going straight to hell
(What's the price, should I try to steal?)
And will I ever even get to fly? Yeah
It doesn't matter to me
I don't care about you
There's nothing I'd rather see
Than watch you fail in life
You know it matters to me
What I think about in you
There's something I strive to be
I see it passing by, by, by, by
On my quest to find tomorrow
I'll be passing the roads of life
I'm not scared to beg or borrow
'Cause I know that I'll be there
I see the light, I trail the light, I know the light
Can you will the right, as you place the time?
And your rules are blind, as you force me to loathe it

Ooh, I'm not a member of society?

I see it passing by<start>Live hate
Blind faith
Breathe deep
Takes me
We hold fast
Wont last
The night falls
Its just its just as well
And if we danced all night
Fell so deep
If we could live to tell what our eyes have seen
We are wolves here
And so I held you tight
Dared to confess
So you can feel my body steal each breathe
We are wolves here
Taste the electricity
City unwinds til we believe
And joy has left
Burns until its dead
And if we danced all night
Fell so deep
If we could live to tell what our eyes have seen
We are wolves here
And so I held you tight
Dared to confess
So you can feel my body steal each breathe
We are wolves here
Live hate
Blind faith
And joy has left
Burns until its dead
And if we danced all night
Fell so deep
If we could live to tell what our eyes have seen
We are wolves here
And so I held you tight
Dared to confess
So you can feel my body steal each breathe
We are wolves here

Hey what's up?
How are you feeling?
I'm alright
Has the treatment been working?
No, not really
What are your remaining symptoms?
I hate myself, I'm not good with other people, I don't know if I'm real or not
Blah, blah, blah, you're such a fucking pussy
Real mature, real fucking mature, conscience
I'm just messing around Bo, your problem is simple, your emotion and logic are at war
Your creativity and analysis are at war and most simply, your left and right brain are at war
To fix the problem we must separate them from each other
Splitting your neurological functions in
5... 4... 3.. 2.. 1
This may hurt a bit, 0
Isolation complete
This is Bo's left brain, objective, logical, cold, analytical
Aware of patterns aware of trends he's efficient, and a prick
This is Bo's right brain subjective, creative, sensory
Aware of feelings, aware of people, he's emotional, and an idiot
Okay boys play nice
I am the left brain, I am the left brain
I work really hard until my inevitable death brain
You got a job you better do it right in the right way with the left brains might
I like oreos and pussy, haha in that order
And I cried for at least an hour after watching Toy Story 3
Cause I am the right brain, I have feelings, I'm a little all over the place but I'm lustful and trustful and I'm looking for somebody to love.. Or put my penis in
Here comes a female, here comes a female
Puff your chest up take your phone out and check your email
Or evolutionary purpose is to repopulate
So gather data now and see if she's a possible mate
Holy fuck I think she might be the one, there's something about her, I just can't describe it
tits
I am the earth, she is the glorious sun
I want her to trust me and I want her to sit on my fucking face!
Alright now right brain you're being insane
No left brain, I'm just being alive
You should try it, you might like it
I worked hard to give him everything he cared about
You were worried about the things he was scared about
I'm calm and collective when you act wild
I am the adult you are child
You think you're the right one every time
You think you know everything but you don't know anything at all
Half of his problems were supposed to be mine
But you wanted everything I hope that you're happy because he's sure not
Well according to my calculations, I'm sorry just let me run this again, you're a giant pussy
Really name calling? Were doing name calling?
I'm not name calling names alright, I'm just stating facts, the fact is you're a quivering pussy
I'm the pussy? Really? Well at least I don't play with toys still
Rubix cubes are not toys alright, they keep my spacial rethink skills.. sharp
Left brain plays with toys! Haha Johnny fucking . . .toy player
Well at least I did my fucking job, I kept him working, I kept him productive
You were supposed to look after him
You were supposed to keep him emotionally stable for all this
Now you're trying to blame me for how he's feeling, how he's feeling!
If he's feeling unhappy it's because you failed him
You did this to him, he hates you I know he does, he fucking hates you!
Right brain I'm sorry, okay?
No you're not
Look, maybe there's something we can do together
Together?
Take the best parts of both of us and put them together
It would let you let your feelings out, It would let me analyze
It's something that George Carlin did, It's something Steve Martin did
It's something special we can both perform, do you know what it is?
Juggling, we could juggle and juggle our cares away!
It was . . . it was comedy. We could do comedy.<start>Every year I get the same feel

Alone to momma's house

To tear you all apart

What will you do when all of them
Want you, want you, want you around

Even though I should have spoke my mind
And I have nothing nice to say
So I won't say anything at all
And now I've swallowed my pride
And I've ignored, I've even lied
But nothing compares to what
You put me through
And all the hate and the bliss
But now it comes down to this
When everything just turns around
Right back to you
I'll kill you with kindness, I can't take this fighting
And I won't be driven by my fears
I'll kill you with kindness, I won't break the silence
And I won't be driven by my fears
I close my eyes and realize
That maybe there's something I've left behind
But everything I saw in you
Was the furthest thing from the truth
And now you've pushed me to the edge
When all my love for you is dead
And I won't let you walk all over me
And I've taken all that I can bare
But no one said that life is fair
'Cause I can't take another day with you
I'll kill you with kindness, I can't take this fighting
And I won't be driven by my fears
I'll kill you with kindness, I won't break the silence
And I won't be driven by my fears
And I'm sick of your complaining
When you're the one who's changing
I'll kill you with kindness, I can't take this fighting
And I won't be driven by my fears
I'll kill you with kindness, I won't break the silence
And I won't be driven by my fears
I'll kill you with kindness<start>Lulu's in the back room
Screaming in her cell

You could move in with me

Dream on, dream on, come
Dream on, dream on
Oh yes, you're such a good boy
Bringing in my tea
Scratching at my blood
Shoots me with sympathy
Don't breathe on me
When you are full of alcohol
I just love it when you're down there
'Cause you look so small
Dream on, dream on, please
Dream on, dream on, come
Footsteps in my blood at night
Breathing in me strong, slipping in my rising
Keep me up, keep me awake
I wish that they'd be gone, so come on

And if I didn't turn around
I wouldn't even know it was there
The pressure is coming down again
From the people who call themselves my friends
I can't seem to get them out of my hair
I'll do whatever I want to do
You know I've got the right to choose
The things that take a part in my life
I don't need nobody telling me
I'll ask you when I need some advice
Don't do it
No don't hide don't hide away at home
Bring the truth that's deep down below
Don't ever leave those things that you believe
You'll fight the lies
Because you're not alone
I don't hurt myself internally
I'm poison free intentionally
A choice I made a long time ago
Because doing iy up Friday nights
Going out and starting fights
These are things I don't need to know
So if people start telling you
The things they think you should do
Get up and take a few steps away
Because this is life and you're in it
You're the one who's got to live
Take your time and choose your own way<start>Another day unfolds
Never felt so cold, I never knew I was turning away
Thought I can't explain, I only love you now that you missed
As I stand in the rain, leave me to go through this
I don't think I could face another sleepless night
If I could only trace that elusive light
In a dreamland flight to your agonising eyes
A never ending flight, my silent cries
Still I close my eyes and my mind becomes clear
Still I dream, and there you are
How still you lie and how your eyes bring back the fear
Still I can't face what's going on here
Everything that I've ever felt has gone
At last my spirit breathes
I see no point in going on
So goodbye
It's time for me to leave<start>(Gonzales, Lujan)

Dejate llevar

Y si maana una nube cubre el sol
Y entra en tus sueos
Y si es gris el tono en tu cancin
No me preguntes el por q'

Juega con el viento

Nunca probaste fuego
Nunca supiste cuando, como

Coda 3, Bolivia<start>The Price of the Dream is Dear
Let me make it clear
Let me make it clear to you right now
Look at me, do you think I would try
Breaking your heart
There is no reason to tear yourself apart
No, no
The Price of the Dream is dear, let me make
It clear
Let me say that I would do all that I can
For you
You know what we got to do
I can see through your eyes too
It takes some understanding
To see it through without demanding
A little bit of give and take is what it needs
You and me that's the way I always want
It to stay
Please tell me baby
Do you think we can make this sacrifice
The bumpy road to love, is worth all that
It costs
The Price of the Dream is clear
It's already here right now, right now
Right here and now
The price of the Dream is Dear
Let me make it clear right now
The Price of the Dream is clear<start>I want to marry a light house keeper
And keep him company
I want to marry a light house keeper
And live by the side of the sea
I'll polish his lamp by the light of day
So ships at night can find their way
I wanna marry a light house keeper
Won't that be okay
We'll take walks along the moonlit bay
Maybe find a treasure too
I'd love living in a light house
How 'bout you?
Dream of livin' in a light house baby
Every single day
I dream of living in a light house
A white one by the bay<start>You run ahead along and I'll meet you
On the road to the Promised Land
I'm not a-ready to give up a-drinking
Think I'll have me another round
Pour me another round
Pour me another round
Pour me another round
You know it's just for medicinal purposes
I got to make the pain go away
I'm not a-gonna do this forever
I'm gonna do it for one more day
Pour me another round
Pour me another round
Pour me another round
Pour me another round
Pour me another round
Pour me another round
Besides all that I like a little buzz
In addition to that I like a little high
I don't know know anybody who doesn't
Like to feel good all of the time
Muscadine wine
Makes me feel so fine
I like corn liquor
It hits me quicker
Muscadine wine
Makes me feel so fine
I like corn liquor
It hits me quicker
Muscadine wine
Makes me feel so fine
I like corn liquor
It hits me quicker
If you'd see the things that I'd seen
And if you had the life that I had
You would never stand there in judgment
You'd sit down and fill up my glass
Pour me another round
Pour me another round
Pour me another round
Pour me another round
Pour me another round
Pour me another round<start>By the rivers of Babylon
Where he sat down
And there he wept
When he remember Zion
It was the wicked

Carry us away captivity
Require from us a song
How can we sing King Alfa's song
In a strange land<start>Stop knocka-knocka-knocking
Stop knocka-knocka-knocking
Stop knocking
Stop it
Went to the No Nukes rally
The Don Quixotes made me feel silly
Went to the punk rock show
Nobody that I know did go
Went to my university
Boys and girls dress up and look pretty
Went to the party last night
I was there, but it was really out of sight
My world is my mind
I'm locking myself inside
People, they can't get in
Oh I have no use for them
Well I just came from my girl's bed
Don't think I'll ever forget what she said
I tried to show her my song
She laughed and said the chords were all wrong
Went out to look at the moon
Blood red and the water was too
Just ran away from her house
Not another word from her pretty little mouth
My world is my mind
I'm locking myself inside
People, they can't get in
Oh I have no use for them
Not my world
So stop koncka-knocka-knocking
Stop knocka-knocka-knocking
Oh stop knocking
Stop it
Stop knocka-knocka-knocking
Stop knocka-knocka-knocking
Stop knocking
Stop it
Well let me tell you what I did
I went to the toilet and sat down
There was no one else around
I went inside my closet
Took my guitar and strummed upon it
Went out to run 10 miles
Sifted through my personal files
Went to my desk to study
There's no world, no love, nobody but me
And that's the way it's gonna be yeah
That's the way it's gonna be yeah
That's the way it's gonna be cuz'
My world is my mind
I'm locking myself inside
People, they can't get in
Oh I have no use for them
Not my world
So stop koncka-knocka-knocking
Stop knocka-knocka-knocking
Stop knocking
Stop it
Knocking on my world<start>I hate waking up it means that I have to die again tonight
35 years old and I'm still sleeping outside
Yeah I think I know your face I don't want to to know your name
I won't give in I'm not like that
I won't give in
You say it's Christmas Eve that don't mean nothing to me
Just another fucked up day just another waste of time
You wonder why I live like this man you just won't understand
I won't give in I'm not like that
Yeah, I won't give in
You smart ass college fuck
Act like you think you're tough
I was just like you
More pride than you could know
Think you pity me
I'll kick your ass if you pity me
I won't give in I'm not like that
No, I won't give in to you
Just go away<start>Walk me to the door
And hold me close just one more time
Kiss me just once more
The way you did when you were mine
The longest walk I'll ever take
Will be across that floor
That's why I'm asking one last favor
Walk me to the door
Divorce is granted, you must set her free
These are the words the judge just said to me
How can I go through life without her like it was before
When I can even make it to the door
Walk me to the door
And hold me close just one more time
Kiss me just once more
The way you did when you were mine
The longest walk I'll ever take
Will be across that floor
That's why I'm asking one last favor
Walk me to the door
I promise I won't try to make commands
I know I don't deserve you back again
My trembling lips are begging now, they never did before
Just one last favor walk me to the door
Walk me to the door
And hold me close just one more time
Kiss me just once more
The way you did when you were mine
The longest walk I'll ever take
Will be across that floor
That's why I'm asking one last favor
Walk me to the door<start>Well if you turn the porch light off and let the marble night withdraw you can smoke a cigarette on the wooden steps mosquitoes are not vampires the moon is not your mother and if she is preparing for a total eclipse, get behind the wheel stay in front of the storm. Get behind the wheel stay in front of the storm. The clouds dream disorder they make faces they make mud on some ancient order which is no longer enforced the sugar bowl is full of ants your sister is a dumpy mess and we're cutting off your head despite your shoulders. Get behind the wheel stay in front of the storm. Just get behind the wheel stay in front of the storm. Just get behind the wheel stay in front of the storm.<start>The hands keep on turning, the pendulum just swings
Prisoners upon this rock, flying without wings
Captured in a moment, still the hours chimed
Joining closer as it shifted with the sands of time
Paranoid dimensions, guilt falls into place
Driven by an unseen force, swelling into space
At beyond the rainbow, cross the Milky Way
Passengers without a choice, slowly turning grey
On through the night, shine on forever
Going insane as we ride the time machine
Waiting for no one, relative to none
Answering to not a thing, except the rising sun
Bouncing on this fabric, at the speed of light
Connecting points of futures past, is its only plight
Passengers without a choice, hanging by a string
Spending with a hands of time, flying without wings<start>Come on
Don't be afraid
If everyone
There'd be nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing left
Put your
If it becomes
Throw it up
Or give it
Give it
Give it
Give it
Give it
So come on
Don't be afraid
If everyone
There'd be nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing left
Shut it off<start>Dream away
You're just a dreamer, boy
And I've been here before
Dream away
You're dreaming your life away
It's what they want you to believe
Salute the flag, say the pledge
That's what they say
It seems to me like there's so much more
Taking it to the wall
It seems to me there's more than what they say
Hold your head up
Target their world
Just let 'em fly
Dreams away
Now, no matter how I try
I just can't walk away
It seems it's inside me and it will stay
So whenever you get down
Just think of all the things we've done
Then you know that we can take it
You know it's just begun
Hold your head up
Target their world
Just let 'em fly
Dreams away<start>(Yow! One, two)
Out on the town, looking for a woman
Gonna give me good love
Anybody want to hand off me
And give me plenty of
She was standing alone over by the jukebox
Like she's something to sell
I said, baby what's the going price?
She told me to go to hell
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames
Singles bar, got my eye on a honey
Hanging out everywhere
She might be straight
She might want my money
I really don't care, no
Said, baby, you're driving me crazy
Laid it out on the line
When a guy with a chip on his shoulder said
Toss off buddy she's mine
Oh!
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame, yea yeah
To be shot down in flames
Hey you Angus, shoot me, shoot
That's nice, woo! Uh! Oh! Oh! Wooooh!
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames
Oh
Shot
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames
I don't want the pain
Don't want to be shot down in flames
Ohhh<start>If your heart's been broken once or twice
And you're bumming just to get through the day
Because all of your beautiful memorys
Are faded in yesterday
And no matter how you try you're gonna be denied
The love that will make it alright
Cause the past is a blast and it happens so fast
Now i want to wither and die
Nothing's really exciting to me
And the future is frightning as can be
4 in the mornig in midtown
Wwe were hanging int he pouring rain
Drinking beer till the sun was clear
We had nothing to lose that day
And i'm so god damn glad tobe here
But you don't care
Hell yes i'm jaded frustrated and faded
Know i 'll never get anywhere
In the meantime been such a long time
Since you kissed me the way that you did
In my front seat out on your street
Before you left me to crawl into bed
And i wonder often wonder
I'd this love or another one of my falsehoods
Got one life got to live
Obligation on me for the times that they give<start>Criminals, doctors, cynics and believers.
Preachers, teachers, murderers and bankers.
The faithless and the Pope,
the weight of our hope
on the girl with the world on her shoulders.
The actor in the wings, to the mocking bird that sings.
From the bottom of the sea, to the penthouse suite.
As I turn to walk away, I overheard her say,
"We're all in here together".
Love, hate, coincidence, fate.
We trust, we lie, we live and we die.
No matter who you are just cannot escape.
That we're all in here together.
Love, hate, coincidence, fate.
We trust, we lie, we live and we die.
I overheard her say,
"you just cannot escape,
we're all in here together."
The ships on the harbour, the city's so tall,
all that rise will eventually fall.
There's nothing you can do,
no nothing at all, for the girl
with the world on her shoulders.
Making our way through space and time,
warmed by the sun, making love to the moon.
We're spinning each day
and we make some mistakes.
but we're all in here together.<start>Look at you look at me ha-ha what a laugh
Tied together yet we're worlds apart
Crazily loving you ha-ha what a laugh
What chance have I when you won't give your heart
Look at me look at you standing there
And not one sign of love can I see
Look at you look at me what a laugh
And worst of all I know the laugh's for me
[ piano ]
Jealous me loving you ha-ha what a laugh
Where are those sweet I-love-you's I once heard
Everybody thinks you love me ha-ha what a laugh
For you forgot the meaning of the word
Look at me look at you standing there
And not one sign of love do I see
Look at you look at me what a laugh
And worst of all I know the laugh's for me
(Look at you look at me what a laugh)<start>Long ago and oh, so far away
I fell in love with you
Before the second show
Your guitar, it sounds so sweet and clear
But you're not really here
It's just the radio
Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby?
Said you'd be coming back this way again maybe?
Baby, baby, baby, baby oh baby
I love you, I really do
Loneliness is such a sad affair
And I can hardly wait
To sleep with you again
What to say to make you come again
Come back to me again
And play your sad guitar
Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby?
Said you'd be coming back this way again maybe?
Baby, baby, baby, baby oh baby
I love you, I really do<start>I'll go on living and keep on forgiving because

We're livin' it up
While the world is catching fire
Dancing in the flames
Feelin' the love, feelin' the love
We're feelin' the love
And we're burning with desire
And waiting out of space
And if it was the last chance to shine
I know that we could make it alright
We're gonna put it all on the line
Every time
We got pride
We own, we own the night
We are, we are the light
This is within your life
And we won't stop now
Give us a sign
Yeah we won't stop now
This is our time
Pride
We own, we own the night

Giving it up, giving it up
Giving it up
In the hail of broken chains
Raining down for days
Never enough, never enough
'Cause never enough
When you're always chasing dreams
We can still believe

She watched me while I fell unaided
And in my time when god's army came and got me
I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb
Cherry brown lips of maple
Olive creams her eyes and face were
And in that town as I walk as a deserter
I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb
Dance for God, dance for mating
The ritual of her figure eighting
And in my mind as I fly above the churchyard
I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb<start>In einer kleinen Hütte,
Da wohnt Sweet Gwendoline
Ich klopfte an die Tür,
Und sie ließ mich herein.
Sie hatte ein Kabel.
Damit schnürte sie mich ein.
Sweet sweet Gwendoline.
Sweet sweet Gwendoline
Ich lag allein im Dunkeln,
Ich wußte nicht warum
Die Fesseln taten weh,
Doch ich blieb stumm
Ich war geknebelt,
Ich konnte nich' mal schrei'n
Sweet sweet Gwendoline, oh oh oh
Sweet sweet Gwendoline
Doch endlich bindet sie mich los,
Ketzt wird sie selber eingeschnürt
Ich fess'le und ich kneb'le sie,
Damit sie sich nicht rüh'rt
Man könnte sie jetzt wunderbar
Als Postpaket verschicken.
Man könnte sie auch ideal
In dieser Stellung ...
Mein Schatz,
Du machst mich so verrückt,
Du bist so gut zu mir
Solange du mich fesselst,
Bleibe ich bei dir
Morgen werd' ich dich eventuell befreien.

That's when I get the shakes all over me
Quivers down my back bone
I've got the shakes down the kneebone
Yeah havin' the tremors in the thighbone
Shakin' all over
Just the way you say goodnight to me
Brings that feeling on inside of me
Quivers down my back bone
I've got the quivers down the thighbone
Yeah the tremors in my back bone
Shakin' all over
Quivers down my back bone

Shakin' all over

Well, you make me shake and I like it, baby<start>Outside someone is cryin'
Ever since the world began
Someone's cheatin', someone's lyin'
Finally I understand
Kisses are weapons, so beautiful and sharp
Kisses are weapons, weapons of the heart
Kisses are weapons, ah, weapons of the heart
Outside someone is cryin'
Thought he had a heart of stone
And I'm out here in the dark
And I'm sighin' and you're out there all alone
Ah, kisses are weapons, weapons if we choose
Kisses are weapons whether we win or we lose
And oh, my love, my love, my enemy
Do you wanna take me in your arms tonight?
Do you wanna make love to me or do you wanna fight?
There are voices far beyond us
Their secret's ours to share
I can hear them lyin'
Broken on a battlefield
Kisses are weapons, so beautiful and sharp
Kisses are weapons, weapons of the heart
Ah, kisses are weapons, weapons if we choose
Kisses are weapons whether we win or we lose
And oh, my love, my love, my enemy
Do you wanna take me in your arms?
Do you wanna make love to me or do you wanna fight?
Oh yeah, do you wanna fight?
Kisses are weapons, so beautiful and sharp
Kisses are weapons, weapons of the heart
Ah, kisses are weapons, weapons if we choose
Kisses are weapons whether we win or we lose
And oh, my love, my love, my enemy
Do you wanna fight or make love to me?<start>Something has gone wrong
We're losing all our rights
Everyone is blind
Everything has changed
Moving every day
Towards a police state
Secret government
Will take it all away
Disinformation
Is your only source
Burying thee truth
Keeping us apart
Illuminati
Secret society
What can we do?
What can we do? Have we all lost?
Is it too late?
What can we do?
What have we done!
I often wonder why
Nobody can tell
Just what the hell
Is going on
Everything you're told
Your entire life
Every single thing
Is a fucking lie
Look around you
Things are not the same
We're letting them win
Who's the one to blame?
Majority
Jason society
What will you do?
What will you do?
When it's all gone
You will be in chains
When it's all gone
You will be their slave
Something has gone wrong
Our minds are numb
We're lobotomized
From mind control
But what of us
Is it not our fault?
We let them rule
We became the flock
Nineteen people
Are in command
You think you know
Just where it started?
They've got the balls
Of Uncle Sam
What did we do?
What did we do?
It's all gone
We are all their slaves
We are fucking blind
We are all in chains<start>She cries, "It's freedom that we need"
But I have yet to see a cause to believe
(I need to feel it, please just let me feel alright)
It comes in waves of need
Ten ways to make you bleed before you get to die
Can we give it one more shot?
Have we thrown all hope away?
Does it have to be this painful
Just to make it through?
This is not a requiem
We're wasting time as victims
Why spend our lives on bended knee
Choosing not to be free
He sighs, "I'm quickly burning out"
All that's left of me are jaded memories
(I need to feel it, please just let me feel alright)
Of what I could have been
If I had only been less of what they wanted
Can we give it one more shot?
Have we thrown all hope away?
Does it have to be this painful
Just to make it through?
This is not a requiem we're wasting time as victims
Why spend our lives on bended knee
Choosing not to be free and we're still here
All together and alone consumed with fear
That one day we'll discover how empty we've become
Sickened and ashamed
We crave what they provide us
So we'll never feel alone
Can we give it one more shot?
Have we thrown all hope away?
Does it have to be this painful
Just to make it through?
This is not a requiem
We're wasting time as victims
Why spend our lives
On bended knee
Choosing not to be free<start>[includes quotes from The Radio Is Broken, Dueling Banjos (Smith) and part of the leather conversation]

Let me stand here all night
Did she take her whole life
Let me know she's alright
And every time it rains
I feel her holding me
And everytime it rains
Are the angels crying
I'll stay strong, I'll be fine
Carry on with my life
I still stare at the sky
Pray for rain, all the time
Why'd you run? Did you hide
Why'd you leave, no good bye
When the clouds, take the sky
Does a soul, give you life?

You've got the chance to do it all
No more chasing
It's time to save ourselves
Can you taste it
Taste it in the air?
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up

A hundred years can't wait another day
The only eagle, only tree
Within a desert that was green
A hundred years can't wait

Midnight
Draws ever near
Daylight
Is fading so fast
It's so close to midnight
Midnight
The melting ice will fuel the sea
By burning gold from ancient tree
A hundred years can't wait
A hundred years can't wait another day
This is progress, this is sin
Injecting poison in her skin
A hundred years can't wait
A hundred years can't wait another day

Draws ever near
Daylight
Is fading so fast
It's so close to midnight
Midnight<start>All right, this is a sad sad situation
One, two, three!
Hitched a ride I was so messed up
But I sure was glad to meet ya
You took my heart like they towed my car
And they're both still broken down
But while it looked pretty good on paper
And I've come to find out later
That you're insane
Turn me off
I've had enough
I'm better off without anyone
I was wrong
Maybe you should stay
Away
You came to stay cause they were painting your house
And you're still here six months later
You spent my money on God knows what
But it sure did cost a lot
Well it's a sad sad situation
And I need a god damn vacation
Cause you're insane
Turn me off
I've had enough
I'm better off without anyone
I was wrong
Maybe you should stay
Away
I'm self-absorbed (self-absorbed)
And shallow too (he's shallow too)
And all I wanted was to sleep with you
A basket case with a pretty face
And I can't take this shit no more
Anymore
Turn me off
I've had enough
I'm better off without anyone
I was wrong
Maybe you should stay
Turn me off
I've had enough

That the ball's been dropped by hands made of blocks
Blame bounces back and forth like a shuttlecock
But give it back to me and it gets ill got
Oh no, you must be mistaken
I abhor your tortures, but there will be no confessions from me
My lips are locked like vaults
Well you can call me San Andreas but it's not my fault
I heard the rumor had a rendezvous
Well, yes, it came on by my place but it passed right through
I've made mistake before, yes I must be fair
I saw YOU drop the ball like at New Year's, Times Square
Where did the buck stop, it took a walk
Sailed like Argonauts, fled like Huegonots
Across the sea to Canada thrown like potato hot
And it lands in the hands of the nappy head
I rise to my defense, counsel approach the bench
Relaxed in the past but I'm in the present tense
Acquitted by my diction my conviction appeals to the fabrication of the fiction
Never tell a lie, well maybe just a little one
But if you want to point the finger, here's the middle one
I pass the puck like Lindros pass the puck
Papparazzi want to drag me into the muck, what the?
I don't think so I'll sing so you get the picture
I solemly swear on a stack a scriptures
Script was written and I'm just an actor
Try to pull through all the bull like a tractor
Attractive as a scapegoat, but I'm sorry
Have to find fault with the ones that came before me
I checked it, it was wrecked when I arrived here
But give them an inch they'll take a light year<start>There's a kind of light shining down through the trees
There's a bright moon light shining down through the trees
And I know my baby's coming down to be with me.
She got a basket on her arm, my love is high
She got a basket on her arm, my love is high
Now when she opens up the basket things are gonna be alright
I hear my baby calling
My, my, my, my, my, my baby goodnight
Well, well
My, my, my, my, my, my baby goodnight
Yeah, yeah
Oh, baby goodnight.
I hear that bird a calling, singing like a whippoorwill
Well, well well I hear that bird a calling, singing like a whippoorwill
And when I hear that bird a calling, it gives my baby such a thrill
And I think I called my baby
My, my, my, my, my, my baby goodnight
Well, well, well
My, my, my, my, my, my baby goodnight
Oooooooh
Oh baby goodnight
And I don't believe you heard me
My, my, talking about, talking about baby my light
My, my, my, my, talking about baby my light
Oh, baby goodnight
And I'm talking to the preacher<start>Once we wake up everyday
And smiled remembering
How we loved the night away
Now we look for small talk
When it's time to dim the light
Then we both pretend we're tired
We can always love some other night
[Chorus:]
So we wake up in the morning
And we go our separate ways
Present in our silence
As the music softly plays
Each day like the day before
We tell ourselves
We'll try once more
To once again we lay here
Barely touching in our bed
We're just two people
Clinging to a thread
And so we just pretend a bit
And we never say the words
That spell the end of it
Still we go on trying
To fan the dying spark
And sometimes
Even reach out
For each other in the dark
[Chorus x2]<start>I will be waiting right here only to roam
When the bells chime like there is no tomorrow
(And you're gonna take me home)
Never gonna ever gonna belong to another, no
Never gonna ever gonna belong to another, no
Leave me alone, I am not an angel yet
My candle shines at night time through the dawn
But my darling you have fallen and don't belong
(And I can't carry on)
My candle shines without a doubt
But the wind in your wings blows them out
And for my arms it is too late
And your wings are gonna have to wait
Leave me alone, I am not an angel yet
Leave me alone, I am not an angel yet
Not an angel yet
Never gonna ever gonna belong to another, no
My candle shines without a doubt
But the wind in your wings blows them out
And for my arms it is too late
And your wings are gonna have to wait
Leave me alone, I am not an angel yet

Leave me alone, I am not an angel yet
Leave me alone, I am not an angel yet

Well you know it's not so when you say it's not well you know you lie
I didn't do one wrong thing to you
Won't you tell me baby why you went and left me here so lonely
I miss only yes I love you
[ fiddle - steel ]
Did I ever make you sad so you'd be mad and love to hurt me
And desert me for so long
Well you're telling everyone what you done you think it's funny
Well listen honey you done me wrong
Well you know it's not so...
[ piano ]
Well you know it's not so...<start>When the white bird flies
From your heart to mine
I surrender every part of me
To the tenderness
Could it be the wine
In your eyes stars shine
And I'm feeling like a child again
Oh, it's taken me a little time
To find words to say
[Chorus:]
Stay
Make this forever
And lay love in my life
Come what may
Cherish each moment of love
As dreams go by
If the first glow fades
From the love we've made
I will hold you closer
In the night
Under heart and key
When there are hills to climb
And your world won't rhyme
I will fight until I get it right
'Cause you're part of me
The heart of me
Only if you'll stay
[Chorus]
The trees and the towers are burning
Fear walks on the sea
My soul in the wasteland is yearning
What does tomorrow hold for me
What can I say
Just that I need you
With you here by my side
We can turn even the desert
Evergreen, as dreams go by<start>The pen they say is mightier than the sword
But don't for a minute believe a lying word
They'll do anything to try and sell their ware
They've got no morals and they don't really care
Chorus
Am i
Am i dead yet
Am i
Am i dead yet
Am i dead...yet
They've got the freedom others have'nt got
They get away with murder and we do not sensationalise
anything that's dull
It can't go on the street it it's not full
Chorus
The cheapo-porn is bound to get the men
Think twice when it has a reading age of ten
Trevial stories get caught in their net
And they can bury you if you're a threat
Chorus<start>Cuando veo a traves del vaso
Veo a traves del tiempo
Donde los sentidos se dislocan
Donde los temores se evaporan
Y aprovecho para desdoblarme
Para salir del vaso
Con las paredes sudo tu rastro
Con la memoria busco tu rostro
Y no se porque
No me importa saber porque
No dejes que
Nos coma el diablo amor
Que se trague tu calor
Que eructe mi dolor
Que eructe mi dolor
Cuando veo a traves del humo
Me voy volando y tu eres mi guia
Entre los mundos nos haremos viejos
Donde algun dia estaremos tranquilos
Y no se porque
No me importa saber porque
No dejes que
Nos coma el diablo amor
Que se trague tu calor
Que eructe mi dolor
Que eructe mi dolor
Y no se porque
No me importa saber porque
No dejes que
Nos coma el diablo amor
Que se trague tu calor
Que eructe mi dolor
Que eructe mi dolor
Que eructe mi dolor<start>(Hinkel)
Can you picture yourself on a paper plane
on a wind of change
And which direction will take you away
Will it have the range
And if you still believe in your dreams
And if they make you see
It's all depending on this careless games
Can you gather yourself from the seeds of love
just for a lark
Or will you watch the world through your colourful glass
even when it's dark
And if you still believe in your dreams
And they will make you see
It's all depending on this careless games
Who's the master ?who's the slave
Is it true when you tell me there's a place in the sky
where you can change your mind
Can you see through this mirror without seeing yourself
when it's you who cries
And if you still believe in your dreams
And they will make you see
It's all depending on this careless games
The dice have been casted
The world is wasted ?goin' down down down
We're goin' down<start>Well you know your time has come and you're sorry for what you've done
You should've never have been playing with a gun
In those complicated shadows
Well there's a line that you must toe
And it'll soon be time to go
But it's darker than you know in those complicated shadows
All you gangsters and rude clowns
Who were shooting up the town
When you should have found someone to put the blame on
Though the fury's hot and hard
I still see that cold graveyard
There's a solitary stone that's got your name on
You don't have to take it from me
But I know what I spake
You think you're like iron and steel
But iron and steel will bend and break
In those complicated shadows
Go!
Sometimes justice you will find
Is just dumb not color-blind
And your poor shattered mind can't take it all in
All those phantoms and those shades
Should jump up on judgment day
And say to the almighty "I'm still stinking of sin"
But the jury was dismissed
Took his neck and they give it a twist
So you see you won't be missed in those complicated shadows
You can say just what you like in a voice like a John Ford film
Take the law into your hands
You will soon get tired of killing
In those complicated shadows
Complicated shadows
Complicated shadows
Complicated shadows
Go!<start>You say goodbye
I've tried (I've tried)
I've tried so hard to keep this alive (alive)
But you'll never understand and
How long will I stay before you run away and
How long will this last before you know it's time
To say Goodbye
Say Goodbye
Say Goodbye
You've tried (you've tried)
You've tried to play these games with my mind (my mind)
And I'll never understand and
How long will I stay before you run away and
How long will this last before you know it's time
To say goodbye
Say Goodbye
Never Cry (you're breaking down again)
Say Goodbye (you're breaking down again)
And I know you don't need me
How was I supposed to know
You'd try to break me
From everything inside of me and everything in front of me
And I don't ever want to feel, I never will but just say it to my face
Say it to my face and tell me
How long will I stay before you run away and
How long will this last before you know it's time
Bye (you're breaking down again)
Say Goodbye (you're breaking down again)
Never Cry (you're breaking down again)
Say Goodbye
Look at you now
You say goodbye<start>Kinda tricky when she's caught in a trap by me
Kinda dumb in a smart little way like she can be
Those cry a little laugh a little moods that fit her to a T
That's why I'm stuck on Jeannie
If she needs a new something there's never ever anything said
But some morning when I'm half asleep here she comes with breakfast in bed
No she's not a politician but somehow you believe the things she says
And that's why I'm stuck on Jeannie
There are times when things go bad and I'm as mad as any man can be
She's the first to catch the meaness who's the first to give forgiveness be
Even through my gloom she can always find the room for sun and flowers
I ask if that's new dress she says no it's really old about an hour
It's her own little world it's a crazy lovin' world forever
And that's why I'm stuck on Jeannie that's why I'm stuck on Jeannie<start>Lets get this party started,

You know it's just the way you go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Mary, Mary, you're the one for me

In your finger tips
I got the honey that ya love to taste
On those lovely lips so go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down

She got a tip from Aunt Mary, said.(?somebody?) was
in love with you
She was so nieve,, famous for her childlike mind,
I don't believe she ever opened her bedroom venetian blinds
Already Eddie was unsteady on the levee
Down Home
Down Home
Little Willy was Chicago's boyfriend, a local screw
He done kicking trippy hippies in the head with his
hobnail shoes
Already Eddie, pitching for pennies, rockin' for bennies,
wound up in the local hole, without a radio,
And he wrote Aunt Mary said "Momma, it's getting hairy,Down Home."
Well it was late in the morning when Chicago bailed
Eddie on out
Which tripped out Willie, oh man you should've heard
him shout..
their way home.
Yeah they wandered off somewhere, they couldn't find
Any road home
You know I'd really like to take her but you know I
couldn't make her
Down Home.
Down Home, get it in now
Down Home, in the morning<start>[Instrumental]<start>It's on your head
Ringing mumbles in your head
Feeling your rust
Ringing mumbles in your head
Strive for the wildness
Follow the signs
Trials of never ending floods
Photo fix they can't
Just lost it from
What I'm soaping wet
Photo fix they can't
Just lost it from
What I'm soaping wet
Mayday come began
Quiet in it's way
Confronting
The man in me
Whose side are you on?
Whose side are you on?
Whose side are you on?
Saw the face at night
Just lost it from
What I'm soaping wet
Saw the face at night
Just lost it from
What I'm soaping wet
I don't know
Bet I could sit for day
I can make it right
I don't know
Bet I could sit for day
I can make it right
Four elastic pleasures
Whatever brings you happy face
I can read black seagull's cry
Four elastic pleasures
Whatever brings you happy face
I can read black seagull's cry
Close to the water
To fell it on his belly
It's our true
It's our...
Saw the face at night
Just lost it from
What I'm soaping wet
Saw the face at night
Just lost it from
What I'm soaping wet

Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi
See me ride out of the sunset
On your color TV screen
Out for all that I can get
If you know what I mean
Women to the left of me
And women to the right
Ain't got no gun
Ain't got no knife
Don't you start no fight
'Cause I'm T.N.T. I'm dynamite
T.N.T. and I'll win the fight
T.N.T. I'm a power load
T.N.T. watch me explode
I'm dirty, mean and mighty unclean
I'm a wanted man
Public enemy number one
Understand
So lock up your daughter
Lock up your wife
Lock up your back door
And run for your life
The man is back in town
Don't you mess me 'round
'Cause I'm T.N.T. I'm dynamite
T.N.T. and I'll win the fight
T.N.T. I'm a power load
T.N.T. watch me explode
T.N.T. (oi, oi, oi)

Watch me explode<start>Definitely this is the wrong place to be
There's blood on the futon
There's a kid drinking fire
Going down to the sea
They got people to meet
Shaking hands with themselves
Looking out for themselves
When they ask you for credit
Give them a branch
When they want you to get it
Chew on the grass
I know, I know
Cause they told me to tell you
There's nothing to tell you
There's nothing to sell you
In the afternoon
Riding the scapegoat
Burning equipment
Decomposing
Cool off your jets
Take off your sweats
I got a funny feeling
They got plastic in the afterlife
When they want you to cry
Leap into the sky
When they suck your mind,
Like a pigeon you'll fly
I know, I know
It's the positive people
Running from their time
Looking for some feeling<start>We're the ladies for compassionate lynching
We fight for all the things we believe
We spend all of our time on your talk shows
We put the stickers on your record sleeves<start>I can't say everything about it
In just one single song
I can't put how I feel in a package
And sell it back to everyone
But wait
There's another boy genius whose fucking gone
I hope the food tastes better in heaven
I know there's lots of rad queer boys up there
I hope everytime they talk to you
They know that they're lucky to be your friend
'cause look
There's another boy genius whose fucking gone
And I wouldn't be so fucking mad so fucking
Pissed off if it wasn't so fucking wrong
It's all fucking wrong
It's not fair- it's not fair
It's not fair
But no one said life was easy
Yeah, but no one said-on one said
Nothings supposed to happen, right?
No, no one told me anything
To prepare me for fucking this
There's another boy genius whose fucking gone
Don't tell me it don't matter
Don't tell me it don't matter
Don't tell me I've had three days to get over it
It won't go away
It just won''t go away<start>and when i'm free
ain't never gonna be the same no how no way
when the day comes i'm gonna live for no one else
except myself
and i know if ever i've been taught
you cannot start to run before you walk
and i know this time i'm going it alone
down in the street
everybody on the come and go
they punch out and march on home
just stuck in line
i never want to lead that life
or give the time
there's something going on out there
somewhere out there anywhere but here
so let em know i'm never comin home again
i just started out
and when i'm free<start>Lost in my hotel with a smitten girl,
We watch TV girls, with bleached out hair in curls.
Set in plastic pearls seen on commercials,
So influential in our melt down world.
We'll stay up all night, we'll stay up all night,
We'll stay up all night...
She's my TV girl,
She's my TV world.
She's my television.
Cathode sun ray skies, burn bed-ridden eyes,
Watch each other's eyes to make sure it's all right.
We'll stay up all night, we'll stay up all night,
We'll stay up all night...
She's my TV girl,
She's my TV world.
She's my television.
And St. Clare hears you and St. Clare's here with you.
And St. Clare knows that you should come... down.
She's my TV girl,
She's my TV world.
She's my television.
She's my television.
She's my television.
She's my television girl.<start>You roll and tumble
With your big heart falling
You roll and tumble alone
You reach forever
With your dirty hands holding
You reach for something you will never know
I heard you singing
In a taco bell bathroom
I heard you singing a cheap trick song
We sang surrender
All the way to county line
When I listen to that song now
It makes me think of summertime
That acid summer
We were wasted and happy
We were laughing in the sunshine
You twist and turn
With your bright eyes shining
You twist and turn in the California sun
You wait forever
For the life that you dream of
You wait for something that will never come
You twist and turn in a slow motion day dream
You twist and turn in your own sweet hell
I don't get so close to the fire anymore
But when I think about you now
It makes me think of summertime
That acid summer
We were wasted and happy
We were laughing in the sunshine
Laughing in the sunshine
In the sunshine
You twist and turn
With your bright eyes shining
You twist and turn in the California sun
You wait forever
For the life that you dream of
You wait for something that will never come
Never ever come
You twist and turn in a slow motion free fall
You twist and turn in your own good time
I can't watch you twisting and turning and turning anymore
You know I never thought a good time
Would turn into a lifestyle
I just can't watch it anymore
But when I think about that summertime
It always seems to make me smile
Yeah that acid summer
We were wasted and happy
We were laughing in the sunshine
Go
We were laughing in the sunshine
Go<start>Thirty seven kinds of coffee
Thirty seconds to decide
As the line backs up behind me
Say, "I'll take number nine."
Things have gotten complicated
There's confusion in your eyes
So I called this conversation
'cause now I realize
We got to simplify this life we're living
Count the gifts that we've been given
Hold me close beneath the changing sky
We got to simplify
Let's spend the day out in the country
Like we used to do before
Before the rat race sent us running
When our hearts were young and pure
We got to simplify...
We can get there again
We can leave this whole world behind
All the love we knew then
Is still there for us to find
We got to simplify...<start>Je kijkt omlaag
Je hebt me net gevraagd
Of m'n handen ook zo koud zijn
Of moet ik daarvoor jou zijn
Het antwoord blijf ik schuldig
Je zwijgt en wacht geduldig
Tot ik eindelijk je hand grijp
En we weten allebei
De jouwe lijkt wel gloeiend heet
Zo koud is die van mij
En ik zeg
refr.:
Lieve lieveling, ga door
Lieve lieveling, ga door
Lieve lieveling, ga door
Waar je was gebleven
Lieve lieveling, ga door
Lieve lieveling, ga door
Lieve lieveling, ga door
Waar je was gebleven
Ga niet weg, maar blijf nog even
Je kijkt naar de grond
Als een twijfelende bruid
Je krijgt het er niet uit
Het blijft weer steken in je mond
Dat ene hoge woord
Ik heb het niet gehoord
Ik heb het niet gehoord
Ik kijk weg
En ik staar maar naar mijn schoenen
Ik kijk weg
Om mijn veters vast te doen
Om op te staan
Om weg te gaan
Maar jij zegt

Well you talk the talk
And you smile the smile
You don't care who you hurt
As long as it's me
Well you play the part
And you tear my heart
You don't care what you take
As long as it's free
And if you think you took me over
You'd better look over your shoulder
And if you think it's all right
The guys are watching you
And I believe
What goes around comes around goes around...<start>Slow-mo fantasy,
black and white slides all around us.
A blood-stained rubber duck,
I really shouldn't siwm these waters.
Lethal undertow,
caught in this web you have spun.
A claw-marked basement door,
I really shouldn't be here alone.
(chorus)
Everything falls when I think of you.
Demons whisper like lovers do.
A world of fear blends with everything I love.
A tall grey silhouette
towering as I grow smaller.
I leave all fear behind,
take comfort in this silent lover.
(chorus)
My heart in my throat and seven steps.
A concrete floor and voices around me.
Beating heart and fragile stairs.
Concrete walls and darkness surrounds me.
A blood-stained rubber duck,
I really shouldn't swim these waters.
(chorus)
(chorus)<start>I want to wish you
A happy prison term
Those days were numbered
Forget now
Feed me nubbies, motherfucker
Into the empty fold
Feed me nubbies, motherfucke
Feed the hunger of the rubby whore
To feel you near
Perched outside my cage
To feel you near:
Greetings, same thing, motherfuck, yeah
Listen, motherfuck, ending, yeah
Empty, empty, empty, empty
Resource:notched down trinket
Resource:mined to nothing
Fleeting, same thing, motherfuck, yeah
Listen, motherfuck, ending, yeah
Empty, empty, empty, empty

Resource:mined 'til nothing
Groan growls and bows to unrest
To pay the fees
And excised
From the daze, from the daze
Groan growls and bows to unrest
Affords the fees
Yet excised
From the daze, from the daze
Leaving, motherfuck, ending, yeah
Leaving, motherfuck, ending, yeah
Empty, empty, empty, empty
Cringe past the next time
The broken cast
Double up eleven
Fosters up another loss:<start>Hey girl, what ya doin' down there?
Dancin' alone every night
While I live right above you
I can hear your music playin'
I can feel your body swayin'
One floor below me
You don't even know me, I love you
Oh, my darling, knock three times
On the ceiling if you want me
Twice on the pipe
If the answer is no
Oh, my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Oh, twice on the pipe
Means you ain't gonna show
If you look out your window tonight
Pull in the string with the note
That's attached to my heart
Read how many times I saw you
How in my silence I adored you
And only in my dreams did
That wall between us come apart
Oh, my darling, knock three times
On the ceiling if you want me
Mmm, twice on the pipe
If the answer is no
Oh, my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Whoa, twice on the pipe
Means you ain't gonna show
Oh, I can hear the music playin'
I can feel your body swayin'
One floor below me
You don't even know me, I love you
Oh, my darling, knock three times
On the ceiling if you want me
Oh, twice on the pipe
If the answer is no
(I love you, I love you, I love you)
Oh, my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Mm, twice on the pipe
Means you ain't gonna show<start>Take me to the place that we met, babe mmm
We could even go back some more
Not a single thing to regret, babe mmm
That you are them all yeah
It's not what you waited for
Or hated for
Awaited through the night
But I still love you, baby
Now, I don't even want to remember mmm
But I better do unless you forget
As the fire returns to an ember mmm
That you won't get yeah
It's not what you waited for
Or hated for
Awaited through the night
All that you meant to me
Was misery
I wasted half of my life
Take all your trophies down
Take off your crown
I still love you, baby<start>All last night we lay in bed making love
I never felt so much before with anyone
Never had to say a word
It was all right there
The warmth inside us flamed and circled everywhere
And if I never have another love
Well at least I had last night
Now I know how the feeling grows
Cause you made me come alive
[Chorus]
I'll never get enough, never get enough
Never get enough of you
I'll never get enough, never get enough
Never get enough of you
I only want to give you more
Now you're gone, I'm all alone just lying here
Waiting for the moment when I'll feel you near
Never asked if you'd come back,
I was too damn proud
I just smile and touched your hair
As you went out<start>Oh, the good life, full of fun seems to be the ideal
Mm, the good life lets you hide all the sadness you feel
You won't really fall in love for you can't take the chance
So please be honest with yourself, don't try to fake romance
It's the good life to be free to explore the unknown
Like the heartaches when you learn you must face them alone
Please remember I still want you, and in case you wonder why
Well, just wake up, kiss the good life goodbye<start>I never knew they spent their days in rags
While I enjoy the life they'll never have
Yet deep within their eyes
Hope still survives
And they don't seem to think this world's so bad
Even as they gather in the square
They know that a better life exists out there
With unity and pride
Faith stays alive
How can I pretend that I don't care?
I have always felt alone
Living like a stranger inside of my own home
Maybe now's the time to greet the winds of change
Could my destiny be right in front of me?
As a child behind the palace walls
Often times I'd search its secret halls
And hope that I would find
A treasure cast aside
I came upon the greatest gift of all
My music player
My private paradise
My music player
A refuge I must hide
And lost at sea forever,
I drifted far away<start>To find myself again,
The walls are closing in
Everything I make seems to take
Buried inside you,
Strangers I once knew,
When no one would take the blame
I put my trust in you,
pushed as far as I go
and for all reasons
there's only one thing you should know
Never mind the unseen, clouds fill my head
Blind without truth in a word
Watching over your steps
Weakness sows its seed
And I still can't sleep
I'm insane underneath your breath,
Who was supposed to feel the shame
It doesn't feel the same
As I feel no pain
there's no choice
better hear my voice
I found escape through dreaming,
have I been this before,
and then came the pouring rain
feeling the reaching over me,
my black sky
wondering what ever could it be
I try to hide away
There's no shelter to find
I've felt this way before,
so insecure<start>I got my mojo working but it just don't work on you
I got my mojo working but it just don't work on you
I'm gonna love you so bad that I don't know what to do.
I'm going down Louisiana, get me a mojo hand
I'm going down Louisiana, get me a mojo hand
I'm gonna fix that woman so she can't have no other man.
I got my mojo working, I got my mojo working
I got my mojo working, I got my mojo working
I got my mojo working but it just don't work on you.
I got a gypsy woman, she's giving me advice
I got a gypsy woman, she's giving me advice
I got a whole lot of tricks, baby, keepin' her at night.<start>He's the latest super hero with powers so profound
He can leap a dotted line in just a single bound
I know you must have seen him in books and magazines
He's the quintessential, mindless, modern epicene
His life is meaningful because he get things done
(bang bang) he's dead
Chalk up another triumph for our hero
The automatic man
It's true you must have met him
He's your best friend and your foe
His opinions are determined by the status quo
A true creature of habit
He smokes three packs a day
When he has an original thought
He forgets it right away
He's a paradigm of carefree living
He's our mentor disturb him if you can
He's the answer if your peace of mind is lacking
He's our savior
He is the common man
So if you are troubled by the daily bump and grind
Then take a careful look around
And brother you will find

And at times like this , I'd be right by your side
Lay your troubles on my shoulders
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile
Saw you in the corner on the moment I walked in
Saw your lonely face across the room
No, I won't forget it
And the way it might have been
Why did you have to leave so soon
You know I'd hate to think that someone
could have loved you more than me
And if I was them, I'd be right by your side
Lay your troubles on my shoulders
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile
Lay your troubles on my shoulders
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile
How long must I wait for the last train to leave here
And the last chance to know
Get to think that I was born too soon
How long honey, when the lovin' don't come
I was there when you left me
Just didn't know how to begin

Good morning TV
You're looking so healthy
We all say "don't want to be alone"
We wear the same clothes 'cause we feel the same
We kiss with dry lips when we say goodnight
End of a century, oh, it's nothing special
Sex on the TV
Everybody's at it
The mind gets dirty
As you get closer to thirty
He gives her a cuddle
Glowing in a huddle
Good night TV
You're all made up
And you're looking like me

Can you eat her, yes you can

its hard to keep track
of whats goin on inside of my life
So many things to do
some days i get confused
and i decide on what matters most
My eyes are open wide but my retina's failing
cant see beyond distraction the walls cant breath
the pain of losing sight something i cant feel
i never want to be blind to what is real
Time comes to a halt
keep them from my vaults
dwelling in the past makes mistakes seem my fault
ill occupy myself
looking for what might help
been busy in florida to stand ignored
chooses things i seek
maybe im to weak
i need something more coz my visions lookin bleek
my tensions always sort
seen my memories leave
its time to clear my head and put my mind at ease
my eyes are open wide but my retina's failing
cant see beyond distraction the walls cant breath
the pain of losing sight something i cant feel
i never want to be blind to what is real
Thanks to Gregory H. for these lyrics<start>Every 45 seconds a woman is raped
Our sexist culture allows no escape
The is violent crime is far from obscurity
When the rate of victims is one in three
Society conditions men to be rapists
And our indifference perpetuates it
With derogatory language that tends to dehumanize
Making it easier for men to victimize
And the pornographic images that help portray
Women as legitimate sexual prey
When sexism is embedded in our judicial system
It's no surprise why the courts won't listen
And the role of attacker and survivor become distorted
So the majority of rapes are never reported
The threat of rape is always there
It's like a poison that saturates the air
A society stricken by a cancerous disease
Where men know they can do as they please
You tell me the punishment for rape
You tell me how much jail time it will take
When one out of three women will be raped
You tell me what it's going to fucking take
Do you see me in my low cut shirt
Or high heel shoes or a miniskirt
Woman is the victim you desire
You say you can't resist your predatory fire
You tell me why I stand guilty and accused
You tell me when I'm beaten an abused
When it's my body that's been raped and defiled
You tell me why I'm the one on trial
Defense attorney?: Do you know the man who "allegedly" attacked you?
Victim?: Yes I know the man who raped me.
Defense attorney?: And isn't this man a friend of yours?
Victim?: Well I thought he was a friend of mine.
Defense attorney?: And were you drinking that night he 'allegedly" attacked you?
Victim?: I had a drink or two but is that a crime?
Defense attorney?: I'll ask the questions if you don't mind!
-What were you wearing: How did you act?
Victim?: My wardrobe isn't an invitation for a man to attack.
-I didn't act in any way to bring this on. Why am I on trail? What did I do wrong?
Defense attorney?: Could you tell the jury why you let this happen?
Victim?: I was in shock. I couldn't stop him.
Defense attorney?: You claim that you were raped but how do we know?
Victim?: I said no, I said no, no, no!
Defense attorney?: Isn't it true you're just a woman scorned?
Victim?: I'm a woman who's been raped and torn.
Defense attorney?: Your honor, I demand that this case be dismissed,
-it all comes down to her word against his!
I may not have bruises all over my body
I may have been drinking at the party
But when I went to his room I never would have guessed
That he would force my no to mean a yes
You tell me why I'm guilty of this crime
You tell me why the responsibility is mine
When women suffer a second rape during trial
Courts help rapists to violate and defile<start>You can't dig what you don't understand, boy
Sometimes it's the only way
Well, the misery's so fucking exciting
Well, the fashion of it all's the fucking rage.
These are hammers on strings making notes, babe
With blood and the frog in my throat
These are binders covered in bad poetry
Now knowing what it's really all about.
Oh where, oh where, oh where...
Did you get that stupid shit-eating grin that you wear?
And what, or who got you through the door?
You're a piece of meat on the killing floor.
These are closed and velvet ropes
And a curtain-sipping cokes
To be certain, it's so slow
That it's hurting, don't you know?
Take your chances in the killing fields
With all the snakes and dogs
And dance 'til you bleed and bone touches steel
And all your hope is gone.<start>I've known a lot of funny people
The ones that make us laugh
I've known a lot of lonely people
Calling from the past
And in my darkest hour
I find the place where I fit in
Somewhere between the heavens
And the devil's weary grin
I always will be haunted by the ones I've loved
Yes I always will be haunted by the ones I've loved
In my eyes
We are the ones that make you laugh
Forget about your troubles
Live in peace, pain and regret
And forget all your troubles
I've known a lot lovely people
Though they never spoke to me
I've known a lot lovely people
And they never meant a thing
So bring on the piper
Or the jester's lonely heart
For even the happy man
Gets lonely in the dark
I plan to be high beneath the sea
So don't hold your breath, just breathe
We are the ones that make you laugh
Forget about your troubles
Live in peace, pain and regret
And forget all your troubles
We are the ones that make you love
When you have no one at all
Yes we are the ones that make you laugh<start>(Lawrence Gowan)
Born of pride and frustration
Under heavy sedation
Fought to be realistic
Everyone pessimistic
Filled with anger and regret
That's how I was till I met you
Trapped beneath indigation
Search for retaliation
Bit the hand of the feeder
Never trusted the leader
Locked and held in a cold sweat
That's how I was till I met you
But you awake the giant
You awake the giant
But you awake the giant
The giant in me
Tossed and turned is the dreamer
Hard to find the redeemer
Bought and sold by my old friends
Cast adrift to a dead end
Stamped and marked as a bad debt
That's how I was till I met you
But you awake the giant
You awake the giant
But you awake the giant
The giant in me
And in that dying haze
Where the giant lay inside me
Waiting to rise
You found a willing heart
And you made it start to break free
And you moved me
But you awake the giant
Elevate my fate
You awake the giant
Mama don't you make the great
But you awake the giant
Come and pull this weight in me
But you awake the giant
Elevate my fate
You awake the giant
Mama come and make the great
But you awake the giant
You know you pull this weight in me
But you awake the giant
You awake the giant
But you awake the giant
Know how to pull this weight in me

You come around, and now I'm warm
I thought that I was havin' fun
And now I see the way it's done
I thought we'd led a life before
And who we were, well I'm not sure
But one thing I know is right
I loved you then
I'm gonna love you tonight
I'm on fire for you baby
Fire for you woman, all night
I'm on fire for you baby
Fire for you woman, all night
So don't take your time, it's gettin' late
We might lose if we hesitate
'Cause bein' free is lots of fun
For me, though I'm just twenty one
I got things to do, and things to see
Might even have to leave you be
But till that time, let's give our all
And don't look back, until we fall
I'm on fire for you baby
Fire for you woman, all night
I'm on fire for you baby
Fire for you woman, all night
It'd be a shame, if our games, were doin' us
With all the time spent on tryin'
Then to lose your lovin'
So come on girl, we'll raise the sky
We'll break on through, we'll get so high
And don't worry about tomorrow's world
The time is now, I need you girl
I'm on fire for you baby
Fire for you woman, all night

luft in sein Zimmer und schliet sich selbst ein.
Und dort thront er auf seinem Bett,
taucht in die Bcher und fliegt dabei weg.
Zu den hbschen Feen, zu den Zauberseen,
zu den Zwergen und Riesen im Wald.
Zu den Berghexen, die all das Gold hier spinnen,
das ganze Stroh dafr bauen sie selbst an.
Doch wenn es spt wird, muss er nach Haus,
wo sie schon warten und rufen "Wach auf!".
Er gilt als Trumer und leicht verwirrt,
als Idiot und ein bichen gestrt.
Doch das hrt er nicht, weil er woanders ist,
wo er mit Vgeln und Wunderpflanzen spricht.
Bei den Nixen sitzt, in einem Kugelblitz
und wenn er will, dann verwandelt er sich.
In einen Feigling oder Held,
in einen Bettler oder Edelmann.
Denn er macht was ihm gefllt,
er ist der Knig aus dem Mrchenland.
Sie haben die Bcher vor ihm versteckt,
damit er endlich die Wirklichkeit checkt.
Daher sitzt er in seinem Zimmer,
starrt vor die Wand, bis es ihn nicht mehr gibt.
Dann flitzt er wie ein Pfeil zu einem Ruberheim
bei der Stiefmutter von seiner Braut.
Er rettet sie dort raus, holt ihr das Zauberkraut,
nur er allein wei, wie man die Rollen tauscht.
In einen Feigling oder Held,
in einen Bettler oder Edelmann.
Denn er macht was ihm gefllt,
er ist der Knig aus dem Mrchenland. Er ist der Knig aus dem Mrchenland.
Er ist ein Feigling und ein Held,

Her thoughts are racing, set on overdrive
It takes a village, this she knows is true
They're expecting her and she's got work to do
He helplessly stands by
It's meaningless to try
As he rubs his red-rimmed eyes
He says, I've never seen her get this bad
Even though she seems so high
He knows that she can't fly
And when she falls out of the sky
He'll be standing by
She was raised in a small Midwestern town
By a charming and eccentric loving father
She was praised as the perfect teenage girl
And everyone thought highly of her
And she tried everyday
With endless drive to make the grade
Then one day she woke up to find
The perfect girl had lost her mind
Once barely taking a break, now she sleeps the days away
She helplessly stands by, it's meaningless to try
And all she wants to do is cry
No one ever knew she was so sad
'Cause even though she gets so high
And thinks that she can fly, she will fall out of the sky
But in the face of misery, she found hopefulness
Feeling better, she had weathered this depression
Much to her advantage
She resumed her frantic pace
Boundless power, midnight hour
She enjoyed the race<start>I don't wanna go out with you tonight,
I just wanna stay home and fight.
Nothing sounds more fun than what we do,
Can't imagine more fun with you.
Do I remember what fun you can be,
No - it's been too long since you've had it with me.
Why would I want to have a good time
When we can stay home and not spend a dime.
It's always fun to be with you
And never have anything to do.
Why go out when we can fight,
It's what we're used to every night.
I don't wanna go out with you tonight,
I just wanna stay home and fight.
Nothing sounds more fun than what we do,
Can't imagine more fun with you.
Do I remember what fun you can be,
No - it's been too long since you've had it with me.
Why would I want to have a good time
When we can stay home and not spend a dime.
It's always fun to be with you
And never have anything to do.
Why go out when we can fight,
It's what we're used to every night.
I don't wanna go out with you tonight,
I just wanna stay home and fight.
Nothing sounds more fun than what we do,
Can't imagine more fun with you.
Do I remember what fun you can be,
No - it's been too long since you've had it with me.
Why would I want to have a good time
When we can stay home and not spend a dime.
It's always fun to be with you
And never have anything to do.
Why go out when we can fight,
It's what we're used to every night.<start>I look ahead, and what do I see?
Some punk rock punker waiting to punch me.
Lacking common sense, emanating heat,
scarred by razors yet I'm the abnormality?
It seems everybody has a social sect.
Some preset group of friends amongst whom which I don't belong.
It seems that everybody wants to break my neck.
Don't wanna fight and ruin the fun. Won't fight. Won't run.
Abnormality. What's going on around me?
Lacking common sense, stimulate and breed.
Reject all knowledge yet I'm the abnormality?
I was never one to be so cool and punk.
I just think I dig the tunes a little bit more than you.
And when your mind is warped by pro-elitist junk.
That's a real bad path to choose. You're gonna lose.
Abnormality. What's going on around me?
But now I concentrate on this. Put away your fighting fist.
Show the world why you were born. Show the world why I am scorned.<start>Teso sul filo di una gloria che non see'Ã¨

Opium narcosis hypnotic dread
I feel her death growing in me
Like a cancer,yet I crave the disease
Mesmerized by her strange power
Beauty and death in union
She blossoms in the 13th hour
Skullflower
Hollow skull emotionless grin
Arcane tunnels sucking me in
Black vortex in her eyes
Reminds me of a love that died
Lady death evolves from a flower
Growing upon my own tomb
Into her groung I'm sinking lower
Skullflower<start>Baby, remember I, I tried to make it right
I don't know what to do
It's mind over matter, it don't matter
If your love is true, remember now
It's mind over matter, it don't matter
If your love is true
Baby, baby, you can make me run faster now
Ooh baby, don't you know, they're comin' through
It's mind over matter, it don't matter
If your love is true, remember now
It's mind over matter, it don't matter
If your love is true (true)
Babe, treat me soft
You always make me feel you want to
I say, thank you so much, remember
It's mind over matter, it don't matter
If your love is true, remember now
It's mind over matter, it don't matter
If your love is true (true true true true)
It's mind over matter, it don't matter
If your love is true, remember now
It's mind over matter, it don't matter
If your love is true (true true true true)<start>Now sit right back as I bust a "rhyme",
I've got the "freshest" beats and I'm always on time,
I'm the baddest of the best,
Yeah I'm the king.
Master of beats and the cross-fader,
I'll cut off your hand just like Darth Vader,
You step to me and you're gonna get "dissed"" homeboy".
Come into my "crib",
Maybe we could "chill",
I might "cap" somebody,
Or kick 'em in the "grill".
Chorus
I'm the "DJ" he's the "rapper",
And the "homeboys" try to step,
I'm the "DJ" he's the "rapper",
In the valley of the shadow of "def".
Yo. Yo, "homeboys" come and "homeboys" go,
But I still kick the "Latin Lingo",
Mi Espanol es no mui bueno.
I'm "stone cold rhymin' "and "spinnin' "on the "wax",
I give the old ladies heart attacks,
'cause I'm "fresh" and "dope" and I'm "dissin' wac MC'S".
I've got all my teeth capped,
Chains to show my wealth,
And I "check myself,
Before I wreck myself."
Well my name is Frankie T, and I'm here to "talk",
About the meaning of Five Minute Walk.
Some say its "wac",
Some say it's "ill",
Myself, "homeboy", thinks it's pretty "chill".
Turn off the TV,
Put down the phone,
Go talk to "JC" and be alone.
Talk to him five minutes a day,
He won't "wig out" or "give you play",
He will not "dis" you in the end,
In fact "JC's" my "freshest" friend.<start>Lying face down in the dust
Your body crippled with mistrust
I wonder if you'll ever rise
Too much of nothing wears you out
There's a lot of that about
I see it lingering in your eyes
If you change the arrow's course
Or feel the punch with all its force
Remember passion never dies
I'll see you there
Should you come through
Patience sits
Her face all blackened up with soot
Ragged clothes won't interrupt
The precious gem that is your life
The lover spurned and then replaced
There's just forgiveness not disgrace
And I say "Passion never dies"
And we'll return
Our candles burn
Patience sits
I won't let you sleep when there's fear in your blood
I won't let you sleep when there's fear in your blood
And if you think that holding on
Is already far too long
Who's to be the judge of time?
It won't seep out through your toes
It only grows and grows and grows
Cause passion never ever dies
When you return
On your own terms
Patience sits
I won't let you sleep when there's fear in your blood [Repeat: x5]<start>I.
I know a man who had nothing
He was a poor man all his life
He lived in a shack by the roadside
With starving kids and a loving wife
II.
He went to church every Sunday
He prays from morning until night, he said
Good Lord, why have you forsaken me
When everything I did I thought was right
Refrain:
Now my Life is coming to an end
There's only one thing I'm wishing for
All my days I have never sinned
So I hope you wont ignore
What I'm asking for...
Chorus I:
Oh honey when I die
Dress me up in a coat and tie
Give my feet a pair of shoes
That I haven't wore in a long time
Put me in a golden box
Not a cross on a pile of rocks
Bury me where the grass is green
And the gates are shining...
Chorus II:
Oh honey when I die
Give me a bed of roses
Where I could lie
I'm gonna use up all the money that I saved
'Coz I dont wanna lie in a poor man's grave...
III.
I know a man who had nothing
He dreamed of satin sheets all his life
He lived and worked like a dog
Licking every boot he sees just to survive
IV.
He comes home drunk every night
Wakes up the kids and talks to his wife, he said
Honey you have been so good to me
I only wish we had a better life
Refrain II:
And now my lifes coming to an end
There's only one thing I'm wishing for
All my days I have lived in shame
So I hope you wont ignore
Just what I'm asking for...
Chorus I:
Oh honey when I die
Dress me up in a coat and tie
Give my feet a pair of shoes
That I haven't wore in a long time
Put me in a golden box
Not a cross on a pile of rocks
Bury me where the grass is green
And the gates are shining...
Chorus III:
Oh honey when I die
Give me a bed of roses
Where I could lie
I'm gonna use up all the money that I saved
'Coz I dont wanna lie in a poor man's...
Oh honey when I die
Give me a bed of roses
Where I could lie
I'm gonna use up all the money that I saved
'Coz I dont wanna lie in a poor man's grave...

but life keeps changing the view
Are we so unalike?
It's a boy's life after all..
It's a boy's life
afterall.
Have I really forgotten
the way I felt at fifteen?
When things were taken for granted,
It's a boy's life after all...
It's a boy's life

Buried deep within us all<start>I feel your heat in dusty whispers
The wind is cold around your moon
It's getting hard to keep our distance
I know your time is coming soon
Don't point your dream on my horizon
Don't take your rose too far from home
Please don't forget we're not each other
Each soul has black thorns of his own
I see you dancing
Your song is clear
You've got to show me, got to show me
There's nothing to fear
Nothing to fear
I have my loved ones you have yours
So let us gaze upon the feast
In God's own name let's eat together
In God's own name please come in peace
See how our children play together
While you and me we stand alone
I know we'll never be each other
If I leave you leave me alone
I see you dancing
Your song is clear
You've got to show me, got to show me
There's nothing to fear
Nothing to fear<start>[Me] I can't move, I can't feel my body
I don't remember anything
What place is this...how did I get here?
I don't understand, what's happening... Am I alone?
[Fear] You've been deserted, everyone has left you
You know it's always been that way
Those frantic years, the people you've neglected
Now the time has come to pay
You're alone
No one here is dancing to your tune
[Me] Is this a dream or is it real?
[Reason] Sometimes the dream becomes reality
[Me] But I don't know what to feel
[Reason] Then I will guide you through this haze
[Me] But who are you, why are you here?
[Reason] I am you and you are all of us
[Me] I can't think, my mind ain't clear
[Reason] Then I will free you from this maze
[Passion] Can't you feel it burn
Deep down inside?
Won't you ever learn
Don't try to hide
Can't you feel that fire?
Scorching you soul?
A wounded man's desire
Out of control
[Pride] I can't believe you're giving up
That's not your way
I can't believe you'd pass the chance to make them pay
You always had complete control
Never thinking twice
You always called the shots, a heart as cold as ice
[Me] You are delusions of my mind
[Reason] And so we are, we're all a part of you
[Me] Am I a part of some design?
[Reason] The one design is in your head
[Me] How can it be you look so real...
[Reason] We are as real as you imagine us
[Me] I can touch you, I can feel...
[Reason] Then take my hand and follow me
[Passion] Can't you feel it burn
Deep down inside?
Won't you ever learn
Don't try to hide
Can't you feel that fire?
Scorching you soul?
A wounded man's desire
Out of control
[Pride] I can't believe you're giving up
That's not your way
I can't believe you'd pass the chance to make them pay
You always had complete control
Never thinking twice
You always called the shots, a heart as cold as ice
[Love] Close your eyes, listen to your heart beat
Surrender to its soothing pulse
Silence the cries, gentle and carefree
Good or bad, true or false...
You're not alone
You'll find me here whenever they oppose you
I am the strongest of them all
No need to fear these feelings that enclose you
I'm here to catch you when you fall
You're not alone
I am here dancing to your tune
[Passion] Can't you feel it burn
Deep down inside?
Won't you ever learn
Don't try to hide
Can't you feel that fire?
Scorching you soul?
A wounded man's desire
Out of control
[Pride] I can't believe you're giving up
That's not your way

I can see as far as the sun and the moon in the sky
Your hands are warmer than mine

How can you say your sight leads you home?
How can you say the warmth makes you?
How can you say?

And I can't seem to handle it

And I've tasted the bitterness of my own tears
Sadness is all my lonely heart can feel
I can't stand up for falling down
I can't stand up for falling down
Simple though love is
Still it confused me
Why I'm not loved the way I should be
Now I've lived with heartaches
And I've roomed with fear
I've dealt with despair
And I've wrestled with tears
I can't stand up for falling down
I can't stand up for falling down
The vow that we made
You broke it in two
But that don't stop me from loving you

Black out, two nights killing off a best friend
Fall out like soldiers walking off the deep end

They never forget the lines that they say
Speaking slowly

I promise you always
We'll make it out one day

White out, two lights shining on a dead end
Drawn out like circles trailing off the pavement
Stand out, don't stop marching till the hearts mend
As time goes by, we set the stage
We play the parts and act our age
We'll never forget the words that they'd say
Talking slowly
I promise you one day
I promise you always
We'll make it out one day
I promise you always
I promise you one day
I promise you always
We'll make it out one day
I promise you always<start>I got rhythm, I got music
I got my girl, who could ask for anything more
I got daisies in green pastures
I got my girl, who could ask for anything more
Old man trouble, I don't mind him
You won't find him 'round my door
I got starlight, I got sweet dreams
I got my girl, who could ask for anything more
(I got rhythm, I got music)
(I got my girl)
(I got daisies in green pastures)
(I got my girl)
Old man trouble, I don't mind him
You won't find him 'round my door
I got starlight, I got sweet dreams
I got my girl, who could ask for anything more
Who could ask for anything more<start>The eagle soared above the clouds
The deer run in the hills
And I may walk in cities
Where the wolf once had his fill
Here is strength for us to find
To turn the old to new
And wipe our eyes of misty years
And see the future through.
I choose this place to call my own
The only grace I've ever known
I never tire of legends grown
We dream too much and time has flown.
Eiledon, I will be there.
Eiledon, my dream is there.
So let me fill my children's hearts
With heroes tales and hope it starts
A fire in them so deeds are done
With no vain sighs for moments gone.
So let me soar up with the eagles
In wild country among the deer
And wake the wolf in every city
And reckoning is drawing near<start>Te quiero tanto que puedo hacer que tu alma quiera
Robar dentro de mis sueÃ±os y escapar hasta tu boca
Te quiero tanto que olvido que el fuego nunca se toca
Te quiero tanto que el viento sigue cantando tu nombre
DespuÃ©s de cantarlo yo
Te quiero tanto que muero si no vivo en tu sonrisa
Si no puedo estar contigo me persigue la tristeza
Te quiero tanto que mi alma se escapa hasta tu ventana
Te quiero por que al quererte me llena todo tu amor
Te quiero tanto que puedo llevarte a volar conmigo
Girar con los remolinos que llevan el corazÃ³n
Te quiero como la lluvia que moja todo tu cuerpo
Te quiero pa' queme quieras
Te quiero con toda el alma
AsÃ­ es como te quiero yo
Te quiero tanto que muero si no vivo en tu sonrisa
Si no puedo estar contigo me persigue la tristeza
Te quiero tanto que mi alma se escapa hasta tu ventana
Te quiero por que al quererte me llena todo tu amor
Te quiero tanto que puedo llevarte a volar conmigo

Te quiero pa' que me quieras
Te quiero con toda el alma

(Randall Bramblett/Davis Causey)
God was in the water that day
Pickin' through the roots and stones
Trippin' over sunken logs
Tryin' not to make his presence known
God was in the water that day
Wadin' in careful steps
Bubbles risin' from his feet
Comin' up from the muddy depths
Castin' out a line
Castin' out a line to the shadows
Castin' out a line but no one's biting
I am at my pitiful desk
Starin' at he colorless walls
Wishin' I was any place else
Down into a dream I fall
Sittin' in a tiny boat
Driftin' on the mindless sea
And if I disappear
At least I'm floating free
Castin' out a line
Castin' out a line to the darkness
Castin' out a line but no one's biting
God was in the air that day
Breathin' out a haunted breeze
Tryin' not to make a sound
Shufflin' through the dried up leaves
God was in the air that day
Circlin' like a drunken hawk
Sweepin' with a hungry eye
Over the ground I walk
Castin' out a line
Castin' out a line to the darkness
Castin' out a line but no one's biting
Castin' out a line
Castin' out a line to the shadows
Castin' out a line but no one's biting<start>Goodbye my friend, yeah I'm leaving for ever
the day that you die, I'll see you in heaven
I swear I can't, I can't stay
I swear I can't, I can't love myself

Goodbye my friend, yeah I'm leavin' for ever
the day that you die, I'll see you in heaven
I swear I can't, I can't stay
I swear I can't, I can't love myself
don't you see, you still got a chance to breath?
don't you see, I want you to stay with me?
listen to me<start>You and me
Me and you,
We are like aliens tonight
We cannot understand each other
Oh no
I guess it's over now
For us
I kiss you, it feels empty
It feels like I don't know who you are
And what you used to mean to me
Oh no
I guess it's over now
For us
Slowly slipping away, away
I lay stunned
Suddenly
I cannot raise my head from the floor
I cannot move or breathe at all
Leaving you
Was not as easy as I'd thought
But now I run
I feel so free
Without you I feel so perfectly pure
It feels like I've been born again
Thank god
That it is over now for us<start>All is well again
I think I'm gonna be alright
And I'm feeling better
Again
Loving you was sad
Affairs of timing that were bad
And the laughing ended
Again
There was a time
When I thought I was fooling myself
But now, I'll take a bow
'Cause I'm free and easy<start>Kakechigau honnou to karada

Theres cans all over the floor
Random skateboards everywhere
Someone just broke the door.
The phone was ringing for some time
But we were singing spade face
We got to go in the morning
And leave without a trace
Weve only got a few more hours
Until the 'rents come back
But no one cares there having fun
The 'rents will have an attack
We gotta clean up this house
So no one knows we were here
We've gotta get rid of the mess
And throw away the beer
We've gotta be out by 9
So we can catch the bus
We gotta be quiet and calm
So no one causes a fuss
Everyone is going mad
And things are getting trashed
Shelves of broken, frogs caught
And every person is mashed
People there that you don't know
But still thay make a noise
So its all part of the fun
They dont know noise annoys
We've only got a few more hours
Until the 'rents come back
But no one cares there having fun
The 'rents will have an attack
We gotta clean up this house
So no one knows we were here
We've gotta get rid of the mess
And throw away the beer
We've gotta be out by 9
So we can catch the bus
We gotta be quiet and calm
So no one causes a fuss
Someone else has just passed out
Theres dirt all up the wall
The food is gone, this isn't fun
But no one cares no more
Druken people everywhere
And its time to settle down
People dance and sing along
'Cuz the music is on too loud
We've only got a few more hours
Until the 'rents come back
But no one cares there having fun
The 'rents will have an attack
We gotta clean up this house
So no one knows we were here
We've gotta get rid of the mess
And throw away the beer
We've gotta be out by 9
So we can catch the bus
We gotta be quiet and calm
So no one causes a fuss<start>You must leave now
Take what you need, you think will last
But whatever it is you think you need
You better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
The highway is for gamblers, you better use your sense
Take what ever you've gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
The sky too now is falling upon you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
Your empty handed armies, is all going home
The lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet too is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
Leave your stepping stones behind
If someone calls for you
Forget the dead you've left behind
They will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match, let's go start anew
'Cause it's all over now, Baby Blue
It's all over now, Baby Blue
It's all over, Baby Blue
It's all over, baby
Baby Blue
Baby, Baby Blue
It's all over Baby, Baby Blue<start>Wasn't it good
The way I touched you late last night
Wasn't it good, babe
In the mornin's early light
Did you know when you close that bedroom door
I bet ya didn't know
Exactly what I had in store
Wasn't it good
When ya felt it coming through ya
Wasn't it good
That I knew just how to do ya
Did you know you never had it like this before
Oh, I bet ya didn't know
You'd be coming right back for more, more, more
Let's have a party
Love's pouring out of my soul
Oh we'll party, hardy
And let the future take control
Just remember my darling
When there's time to spare
You'll be thinkin' bout me
And how hot it felt
Sayin' wasn't it good, wasn't it good
So good
Did you know you never had it like this before
Oh, I bet ya didn't know

Baby, baby so good
Did you love it, can you dig
Did I do it to ya baby so good
Did you want it, can you dig it

Crusades
Alloyed in a void, I am torn, I am born,
Crusades
Ruderal roots tulleric shoots in cahoots
Making life out of death chthonic breath meristem,
Jubilee, I am free, so I rise from debris,
Other seeds who are weak need a spur so I speak,
Every word like a burr, so hoist my voice and rejoice,
Just a spark from the dark ignites a thousand to march
So we embark on a drive to split from the stem,
Divide out of the clade, a parade to invade,
Crusades
Glory to grow as part of a whole,
Crusades
We are roots, we are soil, we are leaves, we are souls
Crusades
Broad canopy from the tree, a decree,
Blazon to the world we were born to press on,
Blank the sky with our kind, make the branches align,
Sing the spores to the throng, fill the fields with our song,
We are bright in our blight, full of poison and pomp,
Molded as one, we will outshine the sun,
Spread like vines as we climb, knots that can't be undone,
The crusade has begun, turn the many to one,
Crusades
Let the blind be led by the dumb
Crusades
The Philistines arrive at the gates
Crusades
Let the brave lie down on their swords
Crusades
The devoted unleash their wrath
One ant is no ant, no branch is a tree,
Crusades
Just a part of a plant I gave up to be free,
Crusades
Rejoice in the life that I gave to a wave,
Of likes that will die and behave all the same,
To populate the terrain until all that remains,
Is our kind of one mind, evolved and refined,
Fall from the crown, I will rot on the ground,
Left by the march that moves on as the sound,
From their step fades, alone, for a purpose I'm placed
Born again in new roots that will rise from my waste
Not proud of it
Not proud of it
I've wasted a lifetime
Not proud of it
We died, then we're born again.<start>You smile so sweetly when you dream
And I wonder what that expression really means
Could it be that you're trying to turn the key when I don't want you to
And I think that you already know
Ain't it funny how the streets seem so gray?
When even the brightest colors seemed much brighter yesterday
And all you can think of is how to get away
You say you don't wanna tie me down
And you point out all the other fish around
Well, maybe it?s just the opposite and I don't want to go through with it
'Cause I think that you already know
Ain't it funny how the streets seem so gray?
When even the ones you love seem to turn their heads away
And all you can think of is how to get away<start>Here in your coma
Here in your sleep
You have lost yourself somehow
I can't stand to see you cry
Tonight
You dream under lonely eyelids
Find what you're looking for
You sleep in underwater silence
Alone
Here in your empty
There's no breeze
Claustrophobic in your skin
Refuse reflections
When they're from me
So in my eyes they will end
Tonight
You dream under lonely eyelids
Find what you're looking for
You sleep in underwater silence
Holding me down
Tonight
You are emotionless
Hold on
And on
You dream under lonely eyelids
Find what you're looking for
You sleep in underwater silence
Holding me down
Keep me alive in you
Just keep me alive in you
Just keep me alive<start>Playin' a pavilion on the outskirts of town,
Playin' where my roller derby rolls.
Just a part time music man, a nobody at the plant,
I'm tearin' up the country with a song.
Mom and papa told me "son, you gotta go to school;
Only way to make the fam'ly proud."
I paid no attention, left my books at home,
Rather play my music real loud.
Tearin' up the country with a song.
Tearin' up the country with a song.
I paid no attention, left my books at home,
Rather play my music real loud.
Play it loud, now! woo!
Tearin' up the country with a song.
Tearin' up the country with a song.
I paid no attention, left my books at home,
Rather play my music real loud.
Ran into a dry spell, seemed nowhere to go.
Good luck turned the tide, I'm on my way.
I remember loadin' big trucks when the summer sun was hot,
You know I could still be there, but I'm not.
Tearin' up the country with a song.
Tearin' up the country with a song.
I remember loadin' big trucks when the summer sun was hot,
You know I could still be there, but I'm not.
Tearin' up the country with a song.

How many hangings under the red moon "..."
How deep will it sink inside eating skin that doesn't match?
The snake makes way through the sheets and goes inside the uterus.
It can seem like a someiyoshino; a cherry blossom petal, that dances sadly.
The stain is the moon that's fulfilled, and the vomiting at night begins.
Don't you remember?
Color of faint... the night begins and people start to awe.
Color of pomegranate... sting with the prick and disappear far away.
How many secret hangings of the premature baby tonight under the red moon "..."
Bloody Baby & Sacrifice
Don't you remember?
Color of Golden yellow... want to be the spider that stings.
Color of tears... remembering the memories.
Color of faint... the night begins and people start to awe.
Color of pomegranate... sting with the prick and disappear far away.<start>Out of here
We're out of here
Out of heartache
Along with fear
There goes the fear again
There goes the fear
And cars speed fast
Out of here
And life goes past
Again so near
There goes the fear again
There goes the fear
Close your brown eyes
And lay down next to me
Close your eyes, lay down
'Cause there goes the fear
Let it go
You turn around and life's passed you by
You look to ones you love to ask them why
You look to those you love to justify
You turned around and life's passed you by
Passed you by again
And late last night
Makes up her mind
Another fight
left behind
There goes the fear again
Let it go
There goes the fear
Close your brown eyes
And lay down next to me
Close your eyes, lay down
'Cos there goes the fear
Let it go
You turn around and life's passed you by
You look to ones you love to ask them why
you look to those you love to justify, why
you turned around and life's passed you by
Think of me when you're coming down
But don't look back when leaving town
Oh think of me when he's calling out
But don't look back when leaving town
Think of me when you close your eyes
But don't look back when you break all ties
Think of me when you're coming down
But don't look back when leaving town today
There goes the fear again
Let it go
There goes the fear
Let it go
Think of me when you close your eyes
But don't look back when you break all ties
Think of me when you're coming down
But don't look back when leaving town today<start>If only you could watch me fall
I cannot feel it anymore
The soul you cut the soul you adore
Cannot feel you anymore
Cause you've run through me with the destructive force
I think somehow I gotta see it straight
I gotta get you out of me
But I cannot get through to you
See me I'm down and I get deeper with every breath
See me I'm over the edge farther with every step
See me I'm down and I get deeper with every breath
Standing over the edge I'm taking my last breath
How I feel like I'm starless
I'm ready to fade now
And how I feel like I'm starless
I'm hopeless and grayed out
Somehow I feel like I'm starless
I'm ready to fade now
And now I feel like I'm starless
I'm ready to burn out
I can transcend you and mentally bend you
But I can't handle the shit that I'm into
I have been blinded and always reminded
Of the things I've wanted but I never could find
I am a part of a world that I hate I wish the
End would come faster my world's a disaster
Can't you see that I;m down and I'm drowning
And I can't keep my head above my wake
I gotta get you out of my veins
I gotta get you out of my blood
I gotta get you out of my scene
I gotta get you out of me
What I'm really trying hard to get down to words
Is the way I fit into this world
Things I survived pushed me to the darkeer side
Because of life as it was the life that was
Yours should've never been mine
But I never could take anymore of this
Cause I'm always gonna get down to the floor
It's a cold gun that I kiss
'Cause I cannot break anymore
Somehow I feel like I'm starless
I'm ready to fade now
That's how I feel when I'm starless
I'm hopeless and grayed out
Somehow I feel like I'm starless
I'm ready to burn out oh
Now I'm starless<start>So clever
Whatever
I'm done with these endeavors
Alone, I walk the winding way
(Here I stay)
It's over
No longer
I feel it growing stronger
I'll live to die another day
Until I fade away
Why give up, why give in?
It's not enough; it never is
So I will go on until the end
We've become desolate
It's not enough; it never is
But I will go on until the end
Surround me
It's easy
To fall apart completely
I feel you creeping up again
(In my head)
It's over
No longer
I feel it growing colder
I knew this day would come to end
So let this life begin
Why give up, why give in?
It's not enough; it never is
So I will go on until the end
We've become desolate
It's not enough; it never is
But I will go on until the end
I've lost my way
I've lost my way, but I will go on until the end
Living is hard enough
Without you fucking up
Why give up, why give in?
It's not enough; it never is
So I will go on until the end
We've become desolate
It's not enough; it never is
But I will go on until the end
I've lost my way
I've lost my way, but I will go on until the end

But I will go on until the end<start>Take me in your arms again
Wash me in your eyes
Tie me to the house again
Love me 'till love dies
Blame me for everything
Not just the bad times
Whispering sweet nothings in your ear
Just like a dead bird sings
Look into my face again
Between us there's a mile
I can see a hole in the sky
As wide as your smile
As wide as your smile
It's not that you've gone away
It's that I've never met you
But I wish you'd come back to me
Just like the night turns blue
Just like the night turns blue
Just like a dead bird sings
Love me 'till love dies<start>I got the drip runnin' into my arm
It got me fillin' up on fluid like a water balloon
A gene modified and out of control
It got me creepin' up the walls like a speedy baboon
I'm saying, doctor won't you put on your glove
Sweet, sweet doctor won't you put on the show
A cool hand and a hot heart
Undone buttons God you're looking so smart
A sharp wit and a trolley of dope
You got me yellin' in your stethoscope
You can chain me down, you can put me in a cast
You can make my pain go, you can make it last
Put me on the table put me in an iron lung
Rub me where it hurts, doctor rub me where you stung
Cut me up, cut me up and see
Cut me up and take this beating heart from me
Cut me up, cut me where it hurts
Cut it out and throw it, give it to the nurse
You're dressed in whites and I'm not dressed at all
I got my hand yankin' on the cord I'm waiting for the call
I got the fever burnin' holes in my skin
And I am assuming the position you can come right in
And plug my cable
Into all those shining machines
It's gonna be a heavy reading
Well, if you know what I mean
Cut me up, cut me up and see
Cut me up and take this beating heart from me
Cut me up, cut me where it hurts
Cut it out and throw it, give it to the nurse
Cut me up, cut me up and see
Cut me up and take this beating heart from me
Cut me up, cut me where it hurts
Cut it out and throw it, give it to the nurse

Over the hill
Over at your place
I'm over the safety

Over the rage
What a mistake

They're the ones I found to make a fire
And all the lonely souls that say so, get fired
And I'm over the wall
Over the hill
Over at your place

Over the safety
Over the phone calls
Over the rage

I've never been found
And it makes no difference

There's never been actions
There's never been promises that I've never kept

Do not lean over the ledge

I think I'll be fine if I'm covered in wine
Nice to hate you and love you again
And see you again
And see you again
Weary and worn little monster is born
Tell me lies and I'll justify them
Desperate today and it's making me pay
For that night for that kiss for your bed
Whoever dared to love someone out there
I don't need a balloon and a pin
The name of the game is outrunning the blame
So I hate you and love you we're friends
Guess we'll be friends

Better stop crying hello and goodbye-ing
Go on through me slip right through my hands
You get your time and the other half's mine
It's okay this love weighs fifty men
It's okay this love weighs fifty men
It's okay this love weighs fifty men
Oh why (why) can't (can't) you take me in your arms now?
Why (why) can't (can't) you take me?
Why (why) can't (can't) you take me in your arms now?
Why (why) can't (can't) you take me?
Why (why) can't (can't) you take me in your arms now?
Why can't you take me?

Endemoniado un jaguar
Que les observa desde la espesura de la selva
Una cinta de seda alrededor
De una bomba de relojerÃ­a a punto de estallar
Una maniobra de nunca atracar
Un perfume de aromas orientales
Un desayuno con tamales
Un accidente previsto en los planes
Del artista equilibrista, del aragonÃ©s errante
A punto de traspiÃ©s
Una lÃ¡grima como una perla
Que vuelve al mar, sea como sea
Suplicando por algÃºn tipo de relaciÃ³n digna de llamarse humana
Que lleve la pena y la quebrada en el bolsillo del corazÃ³n
Una de esas malas compaÃ±Ã­as, factorÃ­a de melancolÃ­a
Que no vienen a ver si pueden, sino porque pueden vienen
Una indÃ­gena alienÃ­gena, que solamente bebe justicia poÃ©tica
Una contienda contenida y loca
Un beso en la boca de la botella de flor de caÃ±a -gran reserva-
Sobre una mesa repleta de vasos vacÃ­os y limones exprimidos
Una sed de ilusiones infinita
Donde nacen y mueren las acciones que brillan
En el tiempo que contempla un mundo hecho a medida
No sÃ³lo del que siembra, sino del que es semilla<start>Eighteen and a wicker basket
Red cape and a open casket
Tied up to a broken lever
If I move it hurts forever
I am not that (host)?
But I want her
Wolf in a winter playground
White snow to let the red out
I hear that alarms are better
Than a warning like a feather
I don't like my tone
But I want her
So here I am
I'm falling to my knees
I'm digging out the shadows of a ghost
When you come around
So here I am
I'm waiting for the tease
I'm sleeping in the (gallows)? that I chose
When you come around
Why sleep I can't forget it
Moonrise I'm now committed
Your move cause I am (tethered)?
Like a slave I don't know better
I listen for your words
Yeah I want her
Lost boys in a haunted forest
Bright things in the maze before us
My life has now been severed
I can't bare to remember who I was before
The day I met her
So here I am
I'm falling to my knees
I'm digging out the shadows of a ghost
When you come around
So here I am
I'm waiting for the tease
I'm sleeping in the gallows that I chose
When you come around
So here I am
I'm falling to my knees
I'm digging out the shadows of a ghost
When you come around
So here I am
I'm waiting for the tease
I'm sleeping in the gallows that I chose

All the lies you said
Now you kindly kiss up to her
But the feeling's dead
Several days have passed now
Darker than any damn cloud now
Liquid sunshine falls down
Harder than all the damn hounds
[Chorus]
Trying to give you summer, but I'm winter
Wish I could make you spring, but I fall so hard
So you always did what you wanted
We will be on our own
I will soon let you go now
Things will be alright
Several weeks have passed now
Grayer than any gray cloud
Several weeks have passed now
And it's so hard
[Chorus]
And it's so hard to get out of bed
She's impossible to get out of your head
[Chorus]<start>A milk lit moon, it floods the room, and lights a path.
Right to the door, they sweep the floor, I drain my glass.
A night of waiting patiently for you,
Drinking for two.
The city sleeps, I walk the streets, alone again.
And no-one hears the stifled tears, I duly shed.
Just waiting on my boat to cross the blue,
Drinking for two.
And if love should stay, at least it could fray, and fall apart at the seams.
But this love of mine is frozen in time, and so i'm stuck inside my dreams.
From basement bar, to late night Spar, I drag my feet.
With time to kill, I will until, the morning creeps.
Across this old skyline searching for you.
Drinking for two.
And if love should stay, at least it could fray, and fall apart at the seams.
But this love of mine is frozen in time, and so i'm stuck inside my dreams.
And there you were, with love to spare, the kindest eyes.
A fleeting glance, a drink, a dance, a long goodbye.
So tired of waiting patiently for you.
Drinking for two.
Drinking for two.<start>Put your dreams away for another day
And I will take their place in your heart
Wishing on a star never got you far
And so it's time to make a new start
When your dreams at night
Fade before you
Then I'll have the right
To adore you
Let your kiss confess this is happiness, darling
And put all your dreams away<start>You got me jumpin' right out of my skin
You keep it up and I'll be comin' on in
You start a feelin' you're the cream of the crop
You gonna break my heart or just make it stop
You told me that you'd always love me true
But then I heard you told another guy too
Take a cold shower but the water boils hot
The way you twist and shake it girl
You tie me in a knot
And get me hot
Ooo hot and bothered
So hot and bothered
You get me
Hot and bothered
Come on now
Now listen
I pick you up at eight by ten we do the town
Empty my pockets just a tryin' to get you down
Throw in the towel I think your games are such a bore
Just when I think I've lost you pull me to the floor
And get me hot
Ooo hot and bothered
So hot and bothered
You get me
Hot and bothered
So hot and bothered
Ooo you get me hot
Hot and bothered
So hot and bothered

We got Steve outside and he's carrying
A full pack.
Now everything's cool and everthing's smooth.
I walked up to the teller, I gave her the letter
She gave me the loot with puckered up lips
And a wink that I found cute, and I said,
'baby, baby, baby'
(Is this some Kharmic-Chi love thing happening here baby or what.)
By that time Fast tapped me from behind
He said it was time to blow, ya know. So out the door we go.
Back to the ride with Steve inside and alive; off we drive
I hurt my lower lumbar, you know we'll
Never get far, riding around in a stolen
Police car, so we dropped it off and
Piled in a Caddy; Steve was driving
Because I had to talk to my man about something.
Running around robbing banks
All wacked off of Scooby Snacks!
I don't give a fuck about the hell's
Gate, ain't punkin' the crowd and I'm still
Standing up staight.
So, we pull these jobs to make a little money;
No one gets hurt if they don't act funny.
On the way to the yacht, we almost got caught,
Fast is shooting mailboxes, not knowing
Where the cop is.
They're at the Dunkin Donuts, adjacent from
The Froman's whose mailbox had just
Exploded. They gave chase, but our man
Steve is an ace; we lost those brothers
With haste. We cast off and along we went
Off Bermuda to an island resort we rent.
Running around robbing banks
All wacked off of Scooby Snacks!<start>Still born by mercy
I fall to the floor
I have no excuses
I have nothing more
Forever in slavery
Bonded by chains
Silently waiting
For all that all that remains
Your perfect kiss
It's dying
Your secret desire
Blessed is the motherland
Safe for little children
No trace of obsession
Binds me to this
You feel my flesh
And I taste your kiss
Burning temptation
So pure and so pale
Lovers for ever
In secret secret desire
Your perfect kiss
It's dying
Your secret desire
Blessed is the motherland
Safe for little children<start>Listen everybody, especially you girls
Is it right to be left alone
While the one you love is never home?
Well, I love too hard
All my friends sometimes say
I believe, I believe
That a woman should be loved that way

To see her treat me so unkind
Somebody, somewhere tell her it's unfair
Let me hear you, baby

Up early in the morning
With her on my mind
Just to find out
All night, baby, I've been crying
But I believe, I believe
That a woman is a man's best friend
I'm gonna stick by her until the very end
But she causes so much misery
I forgot how its supposed to be
Somebody, somewhere, tell her it's unfair

You know what I'm talking about
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?

Love can be so sad
But I have a love that's twice as bad

We want all very simple things
but we know very little
And so we get very complicated stuff
love and such, 'cause all in all we're beautiful
How easily we fall in love
You walk to me, you talk to me
And sudden glances fall upon you and me
This harmony was meant to be a symphony
We all assume that we rule our lives
but we can't even hold our breath
Who knows how suddenly worlds are turning
how suddenly things may change?
We are so terribly unpredictable and wonderful
Just turn around and I'll be gone
How easily we fall in love
You walk to me, you talk to me
Then suddenly you go again
I'm losing you, I'm losing you
Oh talk to me, I'm losing you
And now, it's all very simple now
I hope you get this love alive, as easy as it is
How easily we fall in love
You walk to me, you talk to me
And suddenly you're far away
I'm losing you, I'm losing you
Then silently you answer me:
"You're fading out, I'm losing you"

Et en avant pour le macadam circus...<start>Well, along with our special feature of this Beach Boys' Christmas Album,
once again I'm happy to see the smiling face of the leader of
this popular group here in the studio, Brian Wilson.
Good to see you again, Brian.
Hi, Jack.
This Beach Boys' Christmas Album is really something.
Ah, Dick Reynolds did the arrangements, I guess, huh?
Yes, he did. He did a beautiful job, a wonderful job.
Is this the first time you've worked with him?
Right. I'd been, uh, wanting to meet him and work with him for quite a long time.
Now who's idea was it to have you featured on this, uh, one particular tune--I,
I was particularly impressed with it--"A Blue Christmas."
Well, I... sort of picked out that song to sing for myself.
I, I love the song and uh, I've always wanted to sing it, so I thought I'd sing it.
Well, maybe this will be the start of a whole new career, huh?
I don't know, that's... It, it could, and it couldn't. Ah... I really don't know.
Well, let's leave it to the listeners to see what they think of it.
Right.
I notice this album has uh, ah, along with some of the popular things like, uh,
"I'll Be Home For Christmas," uh, "Auld Lang Syne," and uh, um, "We Three Kings"
and some of the traditional things, that you have a couple of your,
your own, uh, Beach Boys type sounds in the LP, too.
Uh-huh, we've more or less made one side, uh, our own style, and...
Kind of a teen side and an adult side.
Uh-huh, right, um-hm. Contrasting.
Uh-huh. Now, we have, uh, one of your originals coming up here, Brian.
Uh, "Christmas Day." You wrote this for the album specifically?
Yes, I did. Uh-huh.
Uh-huh. And now, do you do your, the vocal arrangements,
or did Dick Reynolds handle all of that?
Dick handled the vocal arrangements on the, ah, the modern side
--the traditional side--and I did the, ah, vocal and the
arrangements of the music on our own style--our basic style--side.
Dick did the strings, also, on the, uh, on the modern side.
Coming up now, ah, a very sentimental type Christmas song,
particularly for those who are away from home during this time of year
--"I'll Be Home For Christmas." Any, ah, thing particular about this,
this tune that you'd like to say, Brian?
Ah, well, I guess there's something very obvious when you hear the song.
It's, ah, there's a very definite influence of the Four Freshmen
on the arrangement as well as the delivery, and, uh, obviously
we all look up and admire the style of the Four Freshmen and,
uh, I feel this has been the greatest--one of the greater--
vocal influences, ah, in the world today.
Well, it's certainly been, uh, nice of you to take the time to come
by again here for our special Beach Boys' Christmas show.
You have a fine album here and, uh, I hope you'll be home for Christmas.
Well, I hope I will, too. I hope everyone's home for Christmas.
I do, too. Brian Wilson, thanks again for coming by.
Thank you very much, Jack.
And here again, the Beach Boys' Christmas<start>I need some new excitement
I need some thrills divine
gonna get what I want
i'm gonna make it mine
don't wanna go where you're goin'
don't wanna do what you do
it's not there so i gotta create it
gotta play my next move
[Chorus:]
and i'm sick
i'm so sick and tired
so tell me what I can do
when it's all been done before
these pills and thrills aren't working
they're not workin' anymore
but the kids out on the street
don't really give a fuck
they're bitchin' all the time but they
won't lend a helpin' hand
[Chorus]
my future is uncertain
don't know which path to take
yesterday is just a day away
tomorrow never comes my way
i'm gonna stop thinking about it
actions speak louder then words
I won't just sit back
I won't sit back anymore and be sick
[Chorus]<start>There's a legend it lives in you
If it breaks the rule
No one would approve
But if that's the truth to save your soul
Secret agenda maps the road
Either with it or on it
This time we might win
Or be gone with the wind
Rise or fall I'll take them all
Secret passion spies on my life
All I can see is your phoenix eye
Face in black veil when would you be undisguised
As you're leaving everything is mystified
Ninmu kanryo ! Flash across the sky
Ninmu kanryo ! Flash across the sky
All I can see is your phoenix eye
Face in black veil when would you be undisguised
As you're leaving everything is mystified
Ninmu kanryo! Flash across the sky
Ninmu kanryo! Flash across the sky
Be a strong, independent mission commander
Kill the scene, and leave without a trace like Ninja
Fighter spirit walks upon the water
Then I'll fade like a Ninja
Disappear like a Ninja
There's a legend it lives in you
If it sets you free
Be what U can be
Follow what Ur heart believes
Intuitively in your dreams
Either with it or on it
Now we see our way
We won't turn away
Rise above all we'll stand tall
Up against the order and law
All I can see is your phoenix eye
Face in black veil when would you be undisguised
As you're leaving everything is mystified
Ninmu kanryo ! Flash across the sky
Ninmu kanryo ! Flash across the sky
All I can see is your phoenix eye
Face in black veil when would you be undisguised
As you're leaving everything is mystified
Ninmu kanryo! Flash across the sky
Ninmu kanryo! Flash across the sky
Be a strong, independent mission commander
Kill the scene, and leave without a trace like Ninja
Fighter spirit walks upon the water

Wonderin' if my baby 'll be comin' back
Hung like a monkey in a coconut tree
I'm so shook up, I got the heebie jeebies
My head goin' 'round like a spinnin' top
I wanna sit down, but I just can't stop
When I get home, I'm gonna pull off my shoes
Get on the floor and dance away my blues
Ah-ha, and do the barefoot rock
Ah-ha, do the barefoot rock
Ah-ha, do the barefoot rock
I'm gonna dance away all my blues
Some people say I'm about to lose my sense
Howlin' like a tomcat sittin' on the fence
Callin' for my baby high and low
Searchin' for that girl, 'cause I love her so
Lookin' at the moon up in the sky
Thinkin' about that girl and I almost cry
When I get home, I'm gonna pull off my shoes
Get on the floor and dance away my blues
Ah-ha, and do the barefoot rock
Ah-ha, and do the barefoot rock
Ah-ha, do the barefoot rock
I'm gonna dance away all my blues<start>Sullen air, whispers of my plans for you tonight,
Hush sweet princess we're gonna take a drive.
Got an axe in the back of the seat but don't you mind,
Just take my hand, please understand that it's gonna be alright...
(chorus)
look at the blade, look into my eyes,
I'm gonna love you, my dying bride.
I really do care for you, yeah there's somethin' deep inside,
That fights against the nature of the bloodlust I hide.
But in the pulse of nature, I feel the pulsin' in my brain,
Though my heart harbors love songs they are crippled and insane.
(chorus)
Put your lips against mine girl they're playin' our song,
Turn around take my hand and I swear it won't take long.
One day I will join you when this illness soon subsides,
And I'll love you with the heart that
Was shadowed by my mind...

hanging out like double D's
sippin on ice teas...
(to be continued)<start>Some of them standing, some were waiting in the line
As if there was something that they thought they might find
Taking some strength from the feelings that always were shared
And in the background, the eyes that just stared
What was it brought you out here in the dark?
Was it your only way of making your mark
Did you get rid of all the voices in your head?
Do you now miss them and the things that they said?
On your own admission you raised up the knife
And you brought it down ending another man's life
When it was done you just threw down the blade
While the red blood spread wider like the anger you made
I don't want this anger that's burning in me
It's something from which it's so hard to be free
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page<start>Well, I've got a woman

My brain's repeating if you've got an impulse, let it out!
But they never make it past my mouth
This is the sound of settling
This is the sound of settling
Our youth is fleeting, old age is just around the bend and I can't wait to go gray
And I'll sit and wonder of every love that could have been
If I'd only thought of something charming to say
This is the sound of settling
This is the sound of settling<start>Here am I
Who while away the mornings
Since you've gone
Too long have I lay alone
Not knowing which way to turn.
And there you are
Quite sure that you were right
Knowing full well
That I'd be the first one
To go down.
And you'd be the one who was laughing
Except when things weren't going your way
And then the lady would say that she'd had enough
Wandering around on her own.
The day you left
Well I think you knew you'd not be back
Well at least it would seem that way
Because you never said goodbye.
But when it comes round to you and me
I'm sure it will work out alright.
And you'd be the one who was laughing
And giving me something I don't need
And you know, I'd always hold you and keep you warm
Oh! more fool me.
Ah, but when it comes
Round to you and me
I ask myself
Do I really believe
In your love.
Yes, I'm sure it will work out alright.<start>I remember when you told me
You'd never give up
I took for granted all the times you
Gave me your love
Now it's over and you're saying
You've had enough
I wanted to die
When I heard you say goodbye
Now there's nothing I can do
Man, I should've known better
I had to watch you walk away
I should've known better
To think that I would be okay
I should've known better
I'm half the man I was yesterday
All I can say is I should've known better
Should've never let you get away
I should've known better
I should've known better
There's so much pain that lives inside me
That no one can see
A thousand reasons why you left me
Down on my knees
I was blind and you were angry
Now I'm coming clean
I told a lotta lies
And I always made you cry
But there's nothing I can change
Yeah, I should've known better
I had to watch you walk away
I should've known better
To think that I could be okay
I should've known better
I'm half the man I was yesterday
All I can say is I should've known better
Should've never let you get away
I should've known better
I should've known better
I should've known better
I won't let you walk away
?Cause now I know better
Give your love to me today
I had to watch you walk away
I should've known better
To think that I would be okay
I should've known better
I'm half the man I was yesterday
All I can say is I should've known better
Should've never let you get away
I should've known better
Should've known better
Should've never let you get away
I should've known better
I should've known better<start>Why do you treat me as if I were only a friend
What have I done that has made you so distant and cold
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be contented again
And will you be happy when you are withered and old
I cannot offer you diamonds and mansions so fine
I cannot offer you clothes that your young body crave
But if you'll say that you long to forever be mine
Oh think of the teardrops the heartaches and the sorrow you'll save
And while I am writing this letter oh I think of the past
And of the promises that you have broken so free
And to this old world I'll soon say my farewell at last
I will be gone when you read this last letter from me<start>The kingdom of God is inside you and all around you,
not in a mansion of wood and stone.
Split a piece of wood and God is there.
Lift the stone, and you will find God.<start>Picture perfect turned to worthless
Bittersweet, the taste is like ash in my mouth
Love, we had it, you're a bad habit
I'm ready to give you up, I give up
Silly me for thinking honesty is something given free
I make the rules and this is how it ends
Heartbreak, baby, is half the fun
You bring the bullets, I'll bring the guns
Take ten steps now turn and draw
I shoot from the hip then watch you fall
Heartbreak, baby, is half the fun
You bring the bullets, I'll bring the guns
Take ten steps now turn and draw
I shoot from the hip then watch you fall
Scenes of passion never lasted
Your mistakes are too much to put behind
I am tired with no desire
To put together things that just fall apart
Silly me for thinking honesty is something given free
I make the rules, this is how it ends
Heartbreak, baby, is half the fun
You bring the bullets, I'll bring the guns
Take ten steps now turn and draw
I shoot from the hip then watch you fall
Heartbreak, baby, is half the fun
You bring the bullets, I'll bring the guns
Take ten steps now turn and draw
I shoot from the hip then watch you fall, then watch you fall
Silly me for thinking honesty is something given free
I make the rules, this is how it ends
Heartbreak, baby, is half the fun
You bring the bullets, I'll bring the guns
Take ten steps now turn and draw
I shoot from the hip then watch you fall
Heartbreak, baby, is half the fun
You bring the bullets, I'll bring the guns
Take ten steps now turn and draw
I shoot from the hip then watch you fall<start>Get yourself cooler, lay yourself low
Coincidental murder, with nothing to show
When the judge's constipation go to his head
And his wife's aggravation, you're soon enough dead
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend
Gotcha with the cocaine they found with your gun
No smoothy face lawyer to getcha undone
Say love ain't the same on the south side of town
You could look, but you ain't gonna find it around
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story, same old story
Same old song and dance
Fate comes a-knockin', doors start lockin'
Your old time connection, change your direction
Ain't gonna change it, can't rearrange it
Can't stand the pain when it's all the same to you, my friend
When you're low down and dirty, from walkin' the street
With your old hurdy-gurdy, no one to meet
Say love ain't the same, on the south side of town
You could look, but you ain't gonna find it around
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story, same old story
Same old song and dance, yeah<start>I've been pushed around
Made to look a clown
But now, now I know
It is time for me to start to grow
I'm gonna be king
I'm gonna see things right
I'm gonna be king
And you will be my bride
I'll show everyone
That my time will come
If you wait for me
I will show the world what I can be
I'm gonna be king
I'm gonna see things right
I'm gonna be king
And you will be my bride
Love does funny things
And to me it brings
Strength to carry through
And to make my name a pride to use
I'm gonna be king
I'm gonna see things right
I'm gonna be king
And you will be my bride<start>Well, I work hard everyday
Come home straight with my pay
My baby either drink it up
Or she threw it all away
I'm gonna quit my baby
If she don't stop cheatin' and lyin'
Well, I would rather be alone
Than to be worried out of my mind
Well, I give her all of my money
I think I'm being kind
She buy a quart of bad whiskey
And the rest is beer and wine
Well, a few nights ago
I had to work kind-a late
Somebody broke out of my house
Just like he was Superman's mate<start>Every time i take my life
to a place where i could hide
you go there to say i'm weak
and that i should stay outside...
but do you know when i was on the lights
they just gave me endless fights
they never gave me something concrete to hold
and i always got cold and alone
when the sun's going down
even lovers condemn
they kick you to the ground
and you don't understand
i'll teach you what's to cry
you gotta see it real
when your wings stop the flight
your certains might fail
everyday i lose myself
in darkened roads where sadness fell
you aren't there, nobody is
and something's braking inside<start>This is a public service announcement
With guitar
Know your rights
All three of them
Number one
You have the right not to be killed
Murder is a crime
Unless it was done
By a policeman
Or an aristocrat
Oh, know your rights
And number two
You have the right to food money
Providing of course
You don't mind a little
Investigation, humiliation
And if you cross your fingers
Rehabilitation
Know your rights
These are your rights
Hey, say, Wang
Oh, know these rights
Number three
You have the right to free speech
As long as
You're not dumb enough to actually try it
Know your rights
These are your rights
Oh, know your rights
These are your rights
All three of 'em
Ha!
It has been suggested in some quarters
That this is not enough
Well
Get off the streets
Run
Get off the streets<start>4Q
Don't tell me what you want me to do

Bold and brave in a rut
Can't take lying and you can't hear me shout

That's mine, I've been crying to it since I was young
I know there's someone out there feeling just like I feel
I know they're waiting up, I know they're waiting to heal
And I've been holding my breath
Are you holding your breath
For too many years to count?
Too many years to count
And we waited for the sirens that never come
And we only write by the moon
Every word handwritten
And to ease the loss of youth
And how many years I've missed you
Pages plead forgiveness
Every word handwritten
Let it out, let me in, take a hold of my hand
There's nothing like another soul that's been cut up the same
And did you want to drive without a word in between?
I can understand, you need a minute to breathe
And to sew up the seams after all this defeat
All this defeat
And we waited for the sirens that never come
And we only write by the moon
Every word handwritten
And to ease the loss of youth
And the many, many years I've missed you
Pages plead forgiveness
Every word handwritten
Here in the dark, I cherish the moonlight
I'm in love with the way you're in love with the night
And it travels from heart to limb to pen
And we waited for the sirens that never come
And we only write by the moon
Every word handwritten
Every word handwritten
And with this pen, I thee wed
From my heart to your distress
Every word handwritten<start>Well we're all packed up and we're Iroquois bound,
tuning our ears for the F.M. sound.
We got a million problems, we're on our way,
44th, New York, U.S.A.
That big crazy city don't blink an eye,
anytime we pass by.
It just keeps strechting up so high,
like a rocket, shooting, to the sky.
Iroquois ! Iroquois !
Special Branch got their feelers out,
our names and addresses 'cos we're in doubt.
Down the corridor, keep in lane,
find the worst seats on the plane.
Find a tacky statue three inches high,
dirty rain falls from a dirty sky.
On the corner of the street there's a big black fella' ..
trying to sell me an umberalla.<start>The sea has many colors
Profoundly red as wine
The skies they bleed with fleeting passion tonight
Come sweet euphoria
Your light is blinding to me
You feel as comforting as a mother's warm embrace
But still you're just as lonely as the sea
We gaze out upon the crashing waves
>From this hillside graveyard masquerade
Sweet terrible angel
Embrace my soul with light
Is it honesty that sunk my lungs and is dying to get out
But still I'm helpless as an orphaned child
Can you cure this loneliness in my heart
My heart
Can you cure this loneliness in my heart

a constant sound
that only I can hear
sort of profound
A deeper meaning rings
inside my head
of feelings that I wish
I would have never had
Still I remember peace
Its been some time
it felt so good so true
hard to imagine
theres a thing I couldnt do
power was mine, beauty was me
boldness in my heart
bound to set us free
Do not disturb the peace
do not disturb the peace
coming down hurts so much
still I remember peace
and I never give up
Rose-red skies turned dark one day
all of a sudden something in my way
a numbness in my brain
I realize the dream that I was dreaming
was a nightmare in disguise
Who said it would be easy
First you stumble, then you fall
you better stand up, but you crawl
life was simple and the future clear
but all the brightness can disappear
Do not disturb the peace
do not disturb the peace
coming down hurts so much
still I remember peace and I never give up
A broken heart will heal
but not a broken soul
if you dont give it all it takes
you hear when the bell tolls
they say lightning strikes never twice
you wanna place a bet
then dare to roll the dice
Do not disturb the peace
do not disturb the peace
coming down hurts so much
still I remember peace and I never give up<start>You go out when you get ready
And you come home when you please
You just love me when you want me baby
And you think it outta be alright with me
When I try to talk, talk to you baby
And let you know just how I feel
You tell me if I don't like it
You know someone else will
Oh, but I done got wise to you baby
You're not the only bird in the sky
Oh so don't ask me no questions now baby
And I, I won't tell you no lies
Because I like to feel arms around me
And lips close, close to mine
So I don't have to beg you to love me
I don't have to beg you all the time
Oh, but I done got wise to you baby
You're not the only bird in the sky
So now don't you ask me no questions
And you know I won't, I won't tell you no lies
Yes you can love me if you want me
Or you keep on playing the field
Because I know if you don't love me
I know there's somebody else that will<start>out of site and out of mind
happens every single time
and now i'm walkin all alone
watch my shadows shrink and grow

here's my letter hope you like
i know the grammer ain't so right

Neck and chest again,

Covered head to toe in blood

Seems like people are the viruses
And earth is simply tired of us
So many heads what if something would give
And kill off our race, maybe diseases from space
Arriving from a comet
With a trail left for the planet
Say the wake it created was the start of the end
Filled with spores that we engineered plant pathogens
What's in the future for the view is many changes
Humans could be in danger
What would you eat to be a remainder
As your food is maimed, to take you out the frame
Some would vaporize
Some would remain the same
Suckers with no cares about the wave of the world
I feel their lives are destined for hard times too
There's a parallel universe that might be blocked
But by emotion we put in to it we could unlock
I'm not sayin' we could escape fate tunneling in this vast
Untranslatable energy filled of dust and ash
Say what something past the starshine
What can abstain the starshine yeah
The next like your starshines<start>Here I am again in this mean old town

And where are you when the sun goes down
You're so far away from me
So far away from me
So far I just can't see
So far away from me
You're so far away from me
I'm tired of being in love and being all alone
When you're so far away from me
I'm tired of making out on the telephone
And you're so far away from me
So far away from me
So far I just can't see
So far away from me
You're so far away from me
I get so tired when I have to explain
When you're so far away from me
See you've been in the sun and I've been in the rain
And you're so far away from me
So far away from me
So far I just can't see
So far away from me
You're so far away from me<start>(And the lights go off)
(And the lights go off)
NOWHERE
I don't always recognize me
Not even my own face
I can't take the ups and downs
So I have to take these pills
And the lights go off
And then I turned around
I got to see your face
As you were falling away
And you looked just like me
I've disconnected
I'm standing in the middle of nowhere
Where nothing's real
I'm stranded in the middle of nowhere
There are some things I just can't control
They're so deep within
And just when I feel I'm ok
And you pretend you're me
And the lights go off
Then I turned around
I got to see your face
As you were falling away
And you looked just like me
I've disconnected
I'm standing in the middle of nowhere
Where nothing's real
I'm stranded in the middle of nowhere at all
There's something wrong
I can't feel the insides of my life
There's something wrong
I'm lost in the middle of nowhere at all

Lay down with me
Don't promise anything
(And the lights go off)
Just lay down with me
I can't promise anything

I've disconnected
I'm standing in the middle of nowhere
Where nothing's real
I'm stranded in the middle of nowhere at all
There's something wrong
I can't feel the insides of my life
There's something wrong
I'm lost in the middle of nowhere at all<start>In this broken place where I was born
It seems there is no peace,
And the very soil that we walk upon
Is filled with tears that never cease,
And you can trace the scars of hopelessness
Like sweat upon the backs
Of all the outcast downtrodden,
Water slipped through cracks
Hold on,
Hold tight
And I am overwhelmed with grief,
to see such suffering,
For those who lack the voice to speak
For those of us left stuttering
May this not prevail,
Dear Lord, your love will never fail
And these frail hands,
They tremble as they pen perhaps their last
And these weak words,
Can never say what cannot be surpassed
When the concrete of the world
Becomes too cumbersome to lift,
And the cataracts of fear and doubt
Cloak truth beyond what we can sift
And darkness, darkness bleeds its way,
When crippling anguish clouds our sight,
The ghosts of dusk have bared their teeth,
Set their claws to bring the night
Hold on,
Hold tight
Darkness cant perceive the light,
though lightlessness has chilled us numb,
And though its wings may cloud the skies,
The dark shall never overcome
Light of the world,
Your love, has never failed
And these frail hands,
They tremble as they pen perhaps their last
And these weak words,
Can never say what cannot be surpassed
I need your love,
And most of all I want to feel your peace,
I need your love,
Let everything that you are not decrease,
(Your love,
Your mercy,
Your light unending.
Your hope,
Your peace,
Your strength my heart is mending.)

Save me)<start>Stay

There were faces in the mirror
Too blind to see they were crying out for me
From the distance (it) gave me shivers
Oh will there be a tomorrow?
I'm losing my mind, full of sorrow
Night and rain
They were calling you
Night and rain
Breaking the spell
Night and rain
Hear they're calling you
Night and rain
Lucifer's opening Hell
We are the innocent
Hunted by the mystic force
The dragonlords are rising from the darkness
Touching your skin
This game we will never win
The unbroken will turned to sadeness
Oh will there be a tomorrow?
I'm losing my mind, full of sorrow
Night and rain
They were calling you

Breaking the spell

And I had a fight with my best girlfriend
When I'm drinkin' I am nobody's friend
So please baby wait for me until they let me out again
I know the same thing has happened before
And each time it happens, I hate it more & more
When I'm drinkin' I am nobody's friend
So please baby wait for me until they let me out again
I spent a whole lotta time sittin' and thinkin'
Sittin' and just thinkin' 'bout you
If I didn't spend so much time sittin' and drinkin'
We'd still have the love I thought we knew
I won't promise the same thing won't happen again
But I can promise, it'll be a long, long time till then
'Cause when I'm drinkin' I am nobody's friend
So please baby wait for me until they let me out again<start>Bile stains, on my pillow by my head and there's vomit from my pen
Laid
Out
on my bed
Paralyzed dreaming of death
Oh the summer how we cantered proud
of each other, proud of the summer
Hair
Drape down like capes
Tangled in
knots, covered in sand
Ohhh tangled we get, through tangents of
death
Spiraling colours through black holes of culture
I wait...
For ribs
to part, reach in and pull out beating organs
And throw the mess to the
curious blank of the
Two of us whom started, til two of us got square
We sat
and shook like homeless
And reluctantly dissolved
Into the social vacuum
lesser when we left deprived
And lay vacantly
The two of us got started,
then the two of us got square
and rid the woe between us
by fucking hard and
drinking equally
For ribs to part, reach in and pull out beating organs
And
throw the mess to the curious blank of the
Two of us whom started, til two of
us got square
We sat and shook like homeless
Then Stood and reluctantly
dissolved
To the vestige of our state
That observes like flightless
owls
While the men drink and note their words to Commonwealth and the
Queen
We rely in our mother and our sister that are there to keep our
heads
While the men fight like lions, for the Commonwealth and the Queen
I
know no men who are lions
Boasting or showing symptoms of life
Live for
themselves but not die for the Queen
Men are not lions
Blessed nor
confident and living for blood
Proud of the summer and kissed by the
sword
That killed off our common sense
The owls and lions are proof
And
how I drank, vomited common sense
Oh destoroyer, I've grown up too
fast
And how I hung breaking my vertebrae
Held in my fists were the letter
to owls
In Soho, In Soho, In Soho
see how I hung?
I drank myself to
choice
For the Commonwealth and the Queen
In Soho, In Soho, In Soho
see
how I hung
I gave up on love
For the Commonwealth and the Queen
In Soho,
In Soho, In Soho
see how I hung?
I drank myself to choice
For the
Commonwealth and the Queen
In Soho, In Soho, In Soho
see how I hung?
I'd
light up on stage
For the Commonwealth and the Queen
My mother lost her
way
And my sister turned away
The system got the best of us

Riding in the rain

,<start>It's been days, months, and years since your tongue-tied, not so awful,
Got me high, left me dry.
I was cold, driving tears, of the double yellow bloodlines.
Where I tried, and I lied.
I'll be your accidental man,
You be my circumstantial lover.
I'm here to ruin all your plans,
I'm here to steal you from your mother.
I'll be your accidental man,
You be my worst kept secret.
I'll come and take you by the hand.
But you take it on and keep it.
Go and say what you will,
All these French words seem to fail you every time.
Get online, Kiss my cheek, Ring my ear.
Every weakness, I'll be with you.
You're so fine,
You're not mine.
I'll be your accidental man,
You be my circumstantial lover.
I'm here to ruin all your plans,
I'm here to steal you from your mother.
I'll be your accidental man,
You be my worst kept secret.
I'll come and take you by the hand.
But you can take it on and keep it.
I'll be your accidental man,
You be my circumstantial lover.
I'm here to ruin all your plans,
I'm here to steal you from your mother.
I'll be your accidental man,

Picking out a tree again
It's you I'm thinking of
Everything in red and green
Along those city streets
It's you I'm thinking of
December days
Make me feel this way
Hope you feel the same
Nobody wants to be lonely on Christmas
Nobody wants to be blue
You are the one on the top of my wish list
After all, it's a holiday made for two
Houses hung with Christmas lights
Sing along with silent night
It's you I'm thinking of
Boys and girls and Santa Claus
Wreath hung on the City Hall
It's you I'm thinking of
December days
Make me feel this way
Hope you feel the same
Nobody wants to be lonely on Christmas
Nobody wants to be blue
You are the one on the top of my wish list
After all, it's a holiday made for two
There's mistletoe
And you never know
What the night might have in store
Girl, I confess
Ever since we met
You're the present I've been waiting on
Nobody wants to be lonely on Christmas
Nobody wants to be blue
You are the one on the top of my wish list
After all
Nobody wants to be lonely on Christmas
Nobody wants to be blue
You are the one on the top of my wish list
After all, it's a holiday made for two
Me and you
Me and you<start>I wish somebody would empty my head
I am so sorry for the things that I've said
This hopeless feeling that's living inside
I'm just a lonely soul who's trying to find
Some peace of mind
I ain't no hero who's gonna save you
I just say "hi" as I'm passing right through
I ain't that crazy, I'm only here for the ride
So please forgive me while I'm trying to find
Some peace of mind
Read in between the lines
Truth that is neither black nor white
Black nor white
Just give me something real
Broken man still searching for the light
In the night
Caught In the middle as the front line falls
It looks like I don't stand a chance
If only I could turn my life around
Or is this just the circumstance<start>It's getting late
It all just wanes and pales and fades away
If we just want it too much
And what a shame if all there is
Is all that's gone away
There's nothing left here for us
Dead light holiday
Killing time to make us stay
Hollow as the promises of yesterday
On and on the music plays
Memories in paraphrase
Falling past my window
Like the morning rain
It's all the same
So many words remaining
Always too late
It never seems worth taking<start>Drunken ferry boat woman
Swayin' on your sea
If I turn on the gas fire
By the rain rattled window
Won't you sail over to me
The hail storm tumbles
The rail line rumbles
You move in the porch with me
On an overcast day
The pale winter city
An afternoon's debauchery
Your blouse your skirt
I'll undo them so gentle
With beautiful care
I'm a lonely man
With five bottles of wine
I'd like you to share
The hail storm tumbles
The rail line rumbles
You move through the doors with me
On an overcast day
The pale winter city
An afternoon's debauchery
Orange street light
Afternoon becomes night
You drink your wine from a mug
There's cats at the backdoor
The snow is two inches
You roll down your tights on the rug
The hail storm tumbles
The rail line rumbles
You lie on the floor with me
Come closer my love
I'm badly in need
Of an afternoon's debauchery<start>The underworld element beckoned in a dream to
Find a sidekick pronto I should
Think Thelma not Daria
So I search hard and near and far for
Someone the description called for
Thought seldom not Daria
Found her in a suburban wasteland
Swaddling clothed and caked in beach sand
At first sight thought that I might turn and
Run out of fear and intrigue
I stood numb kind of military
I'd found her I'd keep her
Safe and sound
Don't make a sound
Look up at the sky shit's going down
I heard a bang and stars collided
Her skin drew me in just like a magnet
Little girl my little world is yours
I took a one way highway headed West heaven bound
Never even thought once to turn round
Real life plays tricks on the brain
Pointed fingers were left in the dust and The ones who doubted rusted
We're out of here like Vladimir
Now I'm looking at a picture where I'm right beside you
Eyes shine with a light that binds you
To this fool with Super Glue
From all the way across the nation
You came with just your name and
Your suitcase I'll keep you
Safe and sound
Don't make a sound
Look up at the sky shit's going down
I heard a bang and stars collided
Her skin drew me in just like a magnet
Little girl my little world is yours
Big bang little girl run away with me
And be my Thelma & Louise
Brush that sand off your ask
Your questions later love me long time<start>All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot headed believer
I threw my hands in the air said show me something
She said if you dare come a little closer
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now tell me now, tell me now, now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now tell me now, tell me now, now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
The reason I hold on
But I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
When you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
Stay..
I want you to stay
Stay..
I want you to stay<start>Oh the weather outside is frightful,
But the fire is so delightful,
And since we've no place to go,
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!
It doesn't show signs of Pauseping,
And I've bought some corn for popping,
The lights are turned way down low,
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!
When we finally kiss goodnight,
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight,
All the way home I'll be warm.
The fire is slowly dying,
And, my dear, we're still good-bying,
But as long as you love me so,
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!<start>We dont need no law and order
What happened to the freedom punk gave us
What happened to the no rules class
What happened to the individuality that punk gave us
Authority is dead think for yourself
They come in the name of peace and hate
Trying to brainwash the youth of today
You better watch out with what you say
If you dont think like them they'll make you pay
Authority is dead think for yourself
Always getting hassled by the man in blue
For looking different and not following the rules
Always looked down upon by the man in the suit
I'd rather me be than be a 9 to 5 fool
We don't follow any rules or laws
We are the ones you hate the most
We don't follow and leaders or groups
We are the punx of today you cant use as tools
You were given the right to chose and not to follow any trends
So think for yourself
You were given that right to choose
So just be yourself and don't follow any rules<start>She wakes them in the early light,
they're going to go away. She dresses them in party clothes, she ties their hair in colored bows. Today is father's day.
He said he'll be there right on time, he'll be there come what may. He'll take them to a puppet show, the little one can't wait to go. Today is father's day.
See him always smiling full of games to play, fun to have a daddy every Saturday.
He brings them home by suppertime, to where he used to stay. As so they kiss him on the cheek, she sees him off, but they don't speak. Today was father's day.<start>I can turn away and hold my breath a day
But I can't escape the stench of the lie
That's haunting my mind
I won't be free even if I'm deaf, dumb and blind
All those weary eyes with their wicked smiles
They come to my dreams, they're watching us now
They're after my head, they're after my life
Why can't they stay dead?
[Chorus:]
I confess to my sin, reaching deep within
It comes straight from my heart, where should I start
In revealing my thoughts, reaching deep within
I'm just letting it out and letting you in
Reaching within
It was so long ago, or was it yesterday
I can't seem to find a thread in my mind
A needle that's sharp that will make me whole
That's mending my soul
It's hard for me to plead, for your empathy
When hatred persists, whom can I persuade?
To forgive and forget
I threw the stone but I stand alone
[Chorus]
Dig in my head and you'll find what is on my mind
Take it all out, I insist that it won't be missed
Wake up the slumbering man,
Give him time to adapt to your world, I just know he can
[Chorus]<start>Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
Penetrate the evenin' that the
City sleeps to hide
Let's swim out tonight love
It's our turn to try
Parked beside the ocean
On our moonlight drive
Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
Surrender to the waiting worlds
That lap against our side
Nothin' left open
And no time to decide
We've stepped into a river
On our moonlight drive
Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
You reach your hand to hold me
But I can't be your guide
Easy how to love you
As I watch you glide
Falling through wet forests
On our moonlight drive, baby
Moonlight drive

Down, down by the ocean side
Gonna get real close
Get real tight
Baby gonna drown tonight

It is morning
She is yawning
As she walks about the room
Her hair falls down her breast
She is naked and it is June
Standing at the window
I wonder if she knows that I can see
Watching Alice rise year after year
Up in her palace, she's captive there
Alice's body
Is golden brown
Her hair hangs down
As she brushes it one hundred time
First she pulls her stocking on
And then the church bell chimes
Alice climbes into her uniform
The zippers on the side
Watching Alice dressing in her room
It's so depressing, it's cruel<start>It's different when you're lonely,
the whole world's in love.
Holding hands between bar stools,
and you're holding your tounge.
Hold on - you're so fucked up...
so fickle.
Isn't this what you want?
So simple, so single.
But it's different when you're helpless.
When the bars close their doors,
growing hostile towards your waitress...
those extra tips went ignored.
It's different 'cause you're desperate
Begging mercy on the sidewalk
to a sea of last callers
(keep the conversations quick
and keep them interested!)
You're different...and they sense it
Your eyes can't disguise it...
so glassy, half empty.
Ready to spill.
Hold on- please don't leave yet.
I can't go home alone,
it doesn't go over so well.
So hold on just a little longer.
At least through the night,
at least 'til the morning.
Hold on. Hold on to me.
I can hardly stand - much less
the sight of myself.
So hold on, hold on tight dear.
Put your foot on the gas -
get me the fuck out of here.<start>Non, je n'oublierai jamais la baie de Rio

Arrives to coincide with all the chaos and
The sparks of when two worlds collide
And it's been hours now ; feels like days.
We've been hours now, in these waves.
We've been phased we've been
Alchemized... melted, liquefied and dried
And left to crystallize.

We've been phased...<start>(Someplace else)
You got into my life
I don't know how you found me but you did
It stopped me heading someplace else
Took me a while to say, wish you belong to me
But now I'm saddened like I've never been
Regretting that we'll leave
And for a while you could comfort me
And hold me for some time
I need you now, to be beside me

Loneliness
Empty faces

Had a fifth of coke-bacardi
Saw a Santa Claus in red
With an aching head.
But he wasn't very merry
In fact he was kinda scary
Ho-ho-hell
Was all he said
He took a drink
And then another two
Beneath the sink
I've seen him turning blue
And in the wake
He thought the chimney had the flu
Screaming like a drunken Ebeneezer Scrooge
I'm drinking up Christmas!
Cause I got no job, I'm a Lazy Slob yeah
I'm Drinking' up Christmas!
Tell your dad and mom that I came to rob them
A Holiday hero
yeah but I'm a zero with yule tide cheer-O
I'm drinking up Christmas!
Tonight, alright!
He's making a list And checking
The kids that he feels like wrecking
As he stumbles through the night
All pink and white
And it was just get going
But then when the buh's start blowing
Challenged Frosty to a fight
He said come on
I got a gift for you
So bring it on!
I'll make you black and blue
A little song
I think that Santa Claus is through
And he got a nose as red as you know who
I'm drinking up Christmas!
Cause I got no job, I'm a Lazy Slob yeah
I'm Drinking' up Christmas!
Tell your dad and mom that I came to rob them
A Holiday hero
yeah but I'm a zero with yule tide cheer-O
I'm drinking up Christmas!
Tonight, alright!<start>Chorus: Cause a disturbance, don't let this slide by
Do you want to end up a McDonalds french fry?
Atomic power, atomic power, death shower, maggies power
The dust is settling, ticking in your brain
Ain't imagination gonna blow you away
Who cares a fuck as it's work for the people?
Compromised labour you build your death with
Cheaper goodies, more time with the family
Don't be fooled with their gestures of equality
The only thing that's equal is your own rotting corpse
Staring at each other to see who'll make it first
Chorus
She holds it over you, you won't hear a thing
No great contender to help the people win
Another white paper gets waved in the air
A victory for the modern world
But you won't be there
Are you gonna let it shower over you?
The new great energy that sucks off yours
Giving all you wanted as it settles in your pores
Make it known just this once that people ain't toys
Cause a disturbance, cause a fucking noise
Atomic power is just another of their ploys
To build their firepower and defend the nation
They expose us to contamination
Contamination etc..
Contains the nation, that old sensation
Contamination etc..
Cause a disturbance, cause a fucking noise
Atomic power is just another of their ploys
TO BLOW YOU RIGHT AWAY<start>You are terrified by the smallest sound
Because you live your life in such a sheltered world
As do those who surround you
Well I have seen you stung by poisonous flies
And you suffer much too much from their bites
There you sit in your comfort watching other people get caught by the
Storm
Many a thing that used to be a secret
Has become so talked about
Not worth a second thought
There's different kinds of secrets now
Times change, it's not enough to say
It seemed a good idea a hundred years ago
You think it's not your problem
It really doesn't matter at all
Every stone that's thrown must fall to the ground
But you don't give a thought to where they might come down
You are feeding the fire over which you'll be roasted
Anywhere that they don't speak the same
In any place that they don't think the same
You think it's not your problem
No no
You think it's not your problem
It really doesn't matter at all
Oh...
Maybe it's not your fate to be a leader of men
But you just leave it all to someone else and complain
You could be so much stronger, but it really doesn't matter any longer
'Cause you're feeding the fire over which you'll be roasted
'Cause you're feeding the fire over which you'll be roasted<start>We were rich once
Before your head exploded
Imagine doing just what the Big Bang did
The whole world
Knew it was loaded
Wave bye-bye 'cause it ain't ever coming down now

I just want to get along
I look up
The heads fly over
I see a boy I know: his hair's on fire
The whole world I discovered
If you're so special why aren't you dead

I just want to get along
I just want to get along<start>Mr. Universe, can you help me please?
I'm only seven stone two
When I'm on the beach, the girls stay out of reach
They all want someone like you.
You've got to help me, now please Mr. Universe
Don't tell me that I'm just a hopeless case
Don't let me down now, please Mr. Universe
I'm sick of getting sand thrown in my face.
Mr. Universe, you know it's getting worse
I need your seven-day plan
I'm thinner every day, before I waste away
I need a muscle-bound man.
You've got to help me, now please Mr. Universe
Don't tell me that I'm just a hopeless case
Don't let me down now, please Mr. Universe
I'm sick of getting sand thrown in my face.<start>Stone by stone, heart by heart
You're tearin' my world, and all my dreams apart
On your own, you're doing it stone by stone
Brick by brick, tear by tear
The love we made has slowly disappeared
It's as good as gone, you're takin' it stone by stone
Why can't you up and just walk away
Do you have to drag it out day after day
I'm tired of tryin', I'm giving up
You tear it down faster than I can pick it up
Room by room, wall by wall
Pretty soon it's gonna fall
Wrecking this home
Doin' it stone by stone
Why can't you up and just walk away
Do you have to drag it out day after day
I'm tired of tryin', I'm giving up
You tear it down faster than I can pick it up
Stone by stone, heart by heart
You're tearin' my world, and all my dreams apart
On your own, you're doin' it stone by stone
Stone by stone by stone by stone
Stone by stone by stone by stone
On your own, you're doin' it stone by stone<start>Since the day I was born I've been trying to do too much
Pounding the road like a scar
I hardly remember the reasons I'm hurting
I know I'm too stuborn to stop
I think Im alive but I wake up so lonely
I hardly remember the good things your told me
I want to be better than this, than Ive been so far
[Chorus]
These are my hands, these are my brothers
Were gonna stand till we see all the right beat the wrong
And this is my heart, Its hard like a stone
I'd go and trade all of my days just for one night out with someone,
Someone to love
If you knew what you had then
You wouldn't let it go son
The song that your singing it doesnt have a chorus
You wana go and blow it right now
You better blow it in style
Well they called you a qiutter
You'll never see the top
You dont have a reason for the feelings you got
You thought youd be somewhere by now, but it turns out your not
[chorus]
Ohhhhhhh, Oh-oh-ohhhhhhhhhh
Someone to love<start>Paints her sky light tangerine
Maple laughter evergreen
Frustrated, it's only believing
And she knows who mind she blows
Come on, Sunday girl
You'll never change the world
Leave it, girl, let's go
Guess the flowers know her name
Brightest angels placed to shame
Must hate her, she had them believing
And she knows wherever she blows
Come on, Sunday girl
You'll never change the world
Leave it, girl, let's go
Keeps me high on her shelf
Treats me like no one else
She wants me to fly but I fall and I fall
And I thought, I thought I had it all
Come on, Sunday girl
You'll never change the world
Leave it, girl, let's go, Carl Bell<start>Somebody please tell me, what am I supposed to do?
You died and I'm here thinking that I hear your voice
But it's somebody else, it's always somebody else
Why did you die? Don't leave me please
I beg you God tonight bring me peace
I'll never sleep without the dreams of you alive
Here with me, alive here with me
The brightness left your eyes as I held your face
Don't tell me it's the right time
And your last words will sustain me
Until my end, until I see you again
[Incomprehensible]
Why is this happening?
Why did you take him away?
I'm tired, I just wanna go home
While words
(Your life)
Evade me
(But a moment)
I'll cling to
(I'll wait to)
Remember you
(Forever)
And what you had
(Your words)
Meant to me
(On my blood)
Could never be forgotten
The chains
(Why)
Of death
(Don't take me)
Are falling away
But my heart still bleeds
It longs for
(Why)
The day
(Did you die)
When we will be as one
One, why<start>So now it's getting late, for those who hesitate, got no one,
But they don't understand and no one hears the sound,
It's like a waterfall, it's an illusion.
[Chorus]
Love is all, waterfall, love is what you are,
Pulls you in, takes you down, it's a sad affair,
But you know as you hold back the power there without the friends
And lovers you could never go on living.
Across the waterfall that's falling evermore down on you,
Cascading through the days, and flowing on it's way,
That's how it has to be, just an illusion.
[Chorus]<start>Caught up in something
You didn't wanna do
It's not your fault so I'll leave it up to you
I'm trying, You're buying
One thing left to say
That there must be a better way
Thought you were big and brave
Now it's the only thing you crave
You've blacked out your memory
Is there anything out there you can see
I'm trying, You're buying
One thing left to say
That there must be a better way
Know you need help but you won't admit it
Going to them might put in it
Trying to handle your addiction
It's in your blood it's an affliction
I'm trying, You're buying
One thing left to say
That there must be a better way
I'm trying, Your buying
One thing left to say
That there must be a better way
Cry to the world you wanna break out<start>I sit in my room looking out at the rain
My tears are like crystals, they cover my window pane
I'm thinking of our lost romance and how it should have been
Oh if we only could start over again
I know you never forgive me dear, for running out on you
I was wrong to take a chance with somebody new
I sit in my room looking out at the rain
My tears are like crystals, they cover my window pane
I know you never forgive me dear, for running out on you
Oh I long to do the things we used to do
I'm lonely and I'm blue yet I'll try to get along
Without you
Teardrops, teardrops, teardrops<start>There was beer all over the dance floor
And the band was playin' rhythm and blues
You got down and did the gator
And half an hour later you were barfin' all over your girlfriend's shoes
But the Greeks don't want no freaks
The Greeks don't want no freaks
Just put a little smile on them rosy cheeks
'Cause the Greeks don't want no freaks
GATOR!
She was the pride and the passion of Dixie
She did exactly what her daddy had planned
She was a perfect little sister until somebody missed her
And they found her in the bushes with the boys in the band
But the Greeks don't want no freaks
No, the Greeks don't want no freaks
So put a great big smile on them rosy cheeks
'Cause the Greeks don't want no freaks
No, the Greeks don't want no freaks
Said, the Greeks don't want no freaks
Just put that monster smile on them rosy cheeks
'Cause the Greeks don't want no freaks
No, the Greeks don't want no freaks<start>Hey little cunts, you squeak when you walk
Well your ass is so tight, you're the sluts of the block
You think you're so tough, hanging out at the arcade
You're checking out the guys, and hoping to get laid
Teenage twats, teenage twats
I like what you got
Yea, teenage twat
I'd like to tie you up and shit in your face
Kick you in the cunt, girl, put you in your place
Puke up your mother's pussy and fuck you in the face
Teenage twats, now's the time, now's the place (Now's the place)
Teenage twats, I like what you got
Teenage twats, teenage twats
I like what you got<start>I'm a soldier in the forever wars
No photos of a family in my wallet
Got no ID, no credit cards, I don't exist
I never have, I never have
Raised in jungles I quickly learned to read the trees
Schooled in deserts I walk on shifting sands
Neutral shadows, unseen beneath a bed of leaves
I await the call, open frequency to the square go
I want a square go, square go
Square go, square go
My blood is ice, the temperatures rising
My soul a glacier, I move alone
A pilgrim's progress in a shadow world
I learned to sit in silence with my sounds
I want a square go, I want a square go
Square go
Tired of the loser I would be put down
I wanna punch back, fight back
I wanna slash, I wanna knife
I wanna just get back at this world
One day I want a level playing field
I just wanna see the world
Fight the world on my terms
Wanted to fight back
My blood is ice, the temperatures rising
My soul a glacier, I move alone, I move alone
Alone, alone<start>Tinted hair and painted lips polish on your fingertips I hardly knew it was you
Shabby dress and worn out lock a shadow of the girl I love I hardly knew it was you
You once said that you would have no one not no one will ever have you
A life of hardship and disgrace I see it written on your face I hardly knew it was you
Custom jewels and cheap perfume you're like a rose that's lost its bloom
I hardly knew it was you
From the simple girl I knew you have changed dear doin' through
I hardly knew it was you
We could have lived our lives together but your heart had a mind all its own
What a pity what a shame I don't know who's to blame
But I hardly knew it was you<start>The world is coming to an end its gonna fall into the sea
The ice caps are all melting but youre still mad at me
And all your reservations will be washed upon the sand
But you dont have to love me
Tonight Ill be your man
Yeah you dont have to love me
Cause tonight Ill be your man
Life in the Big Easy will probably never be that way
Sweet Lucinda Williams takes the glory over the fame
But you and I were dreamers theyre going to catch us in the end
But you dont have to love me
Tonight Ill be your man
Yeah you dont have to love me
Cause tonight Ill be your man
If you dont love me
You dont have to explain.
If you dont want me
Well just play this little game
With everything thats going wrong
Each day could be our last
You dont have to love me
You dont have to love me
But tonight Ill be your man
But you dont have love me
Tonight Ill be your man
Yeah you dont have to love me
Cause tonight Ill be your man
Yeah you dont have to love me
Tonight Ill be your man
Yeah you dont have to love me
Cause tonight Ill be your man<start>Maybe I act on confused behaviour
Maybe waves crash like semi-trailer
Maybe I'll spend my off-time without you
It seems like we need our own space
And all the time I wasted away
I don't feel good unless you stay
And all the time I chased you away
Simply to catch back up with
[Chorus]
Your solitude is welcome
Your attitude is welcome
All you see is red lights behind me
Maybe this isn't what you wanted, baby
I don't blame you falling backwards
No one's ever quite confused you this way
And all this time we wasted away
We don't feel good unless we're gray
And all the times I chased you away
I simply don't feel good
[Chorus]
All this time, we heard alarms
Come to find, we fell apart
This whole thing has crashed down, crashed down
All this time, we heard alarms
[Chorus]
You are welcome<start>You can't go out the real human nature
You can't fight against the primary instincts
Don't pretend the opposite !
You're not different
[solo mr 8]
So easy to destroy, too tiring to build
Making the good is too expensive !
No lessons, no progressions
The story remains the same
Lazy human race !!!
Politics of money
Dictatorships of power
Maniacs of control
All over the world
The same mistakes
Full of lies !!!
The same wastes
Full of cries !!!
You're not better
You'll never change
You'll never be better
You won't change !
Silhouette without form
Discolored shadow
Paralysed strength
Gesture without movement
Poor human race !!!<start>Indeed there's such a thing as ghosts
More to cause you fear
You never know just where or when
But surely they'll appear
Quiet men turn into wolves
During certain moons
And sirens sing their siren songs
Sweet and deadly tunes
We're here to tell you
All of this is real
And if you're terrified today
It's how you're supposed to feel
For real
We're here to tell you
Ghosts are here for good
And if this doesn't terrify you
It should, it should
Don't you know the feeling
When blood has left your veins
Horsemen of apocalypse
Ride through poison rains
The devil's in the details
And in the grand design
And once he gets your number
He calls you all the time
We're here to tell you
All of this is real
And if you're terrified today
It's how you're supposed to feel
(For real)
We're here to tell you
Ghosts are here for good
And if this doesn't terrify you
It should, it should!<start>Station man
I've been waiting
Can you tell me
When we're leaving?
Midnight train
Now is leaving
Engine screaming
Where I'm going I don't know
But you tell me I must go
When we're leaving I don't know
But you tell me now
I see it's coming and bringing something
This train of lovin' I see it's comin'
I feel it's runnin' this train of lovin'
From ages past<start>Here we are, once again
Stronger now than we have ever been
Hand in hand, heart to heart
Now we made it through the hardest part
We had to break it all down to build it back up
Lean on each other when the times got rough
How we survive going through so much
Baby you and I could write a book about love
Here we are, one to one
Looking back to see how far we come
We shared it all, you and I
We're still together after all this time
We had to break it all down to build it back up
Lean on each other when the times got rough
How we survive going through so much
Baby you and I could write a book about love
Here we are, once again
We're stronger now than we have ever been
With hand in hand, with heart to heart
Here we are, here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are<start>Snap the cane and take the blame,
Tie it in a knot and swing again.

Gather your thoughts and make the call.
Make the call, Make the call.

Snap the cane and take the blame,
Tie it in a knot and swing again.
Hope will rise and hope will fall,

Nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong
Real life is ordinary
Sometimes you don't want to live (Want to live)
Sometimes you gotta do what you don't want to do
To get away with an unordinary life
I met a teacher, he want to be a dreamer
I met a sister, she want to meet her maker
I met a poet, he want to be a joke
I met a dog, he just want a bone

They got their own bark and they got their own bite
Waitin' in line I can't wait no more... No
Slip right in, get kicked out the back door
I don't know
If it's possible to tame one
I don't know
If she'll follow me home
I don't know
What it is about her
Sunset babies all got rabies
Sunset babies all got rabies
Got my shot...
They got a sixth sense, they know why you're here
They can smell the fear through the smoke and the beer
They're a vicious breed and they just don't care
You think you're in but you're getting nowhere
I don't know
If it's safe to pet one
I don't know
To go for my throat
I don't know
What it is about them
Sunset babies all got rabies
Sunset babies all got rabies
And I'd buy her a diamond collar, if she'd only throw me a bone
Here I am alone...
Sunset babies all got rabies
Sunset babies all got rabies
Got my shot...
And she's supposed to be a mans best friend
Why she play around
Now I gotta put that old girl down<start>The song came and went
Like the times that we spent
Hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent
I laughed and she'd smile
It would last for awhile
You don't know what you got till you lose it all again
Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go
A cool evening dance
Listening to the bluegrass band takes the chill
From the air till they play the last song
I'll do my time
Keeping you off my mind but there's moments
That I find, I'm not feeling so strong
Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go
Running down by the lake shore
She did love the sound of a summer storm
It played on the lake like a mandolin
Now it's washing her away again
Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go
The boat's steaming in
I watch the side wheel spin and I
Think about her when I hear that whistle blow
I can't change my mind
I knew all the time that she'd go
But that's a choice I made long ago
Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go<start>Lay lady lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Lay lady lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I show them to you and you see them shine.
Lay lady lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Stay lady stay, stay with your man a while.
Until the break of day, let me see you make him Smile.
His clothes are dirty but his, his hands are clean
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Stay lady stay, stay with your man a while.
Why wait any longer for the world to begin
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he's standing in front of you, ooh ooh
Lay across my big brass bed.
Stay lady stay
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night
Stay lady stay, stay while the night is still ahead
Lay lady lay...
Stay... stay!...
Ahhh ahhhhhhh
Ohhhh<start>It's a full moon and I stay where
I used to stay, nothing's changed
Everything keeps haunting me
How long more? How long more?
Haunted, haunted, haunted
It's a full moon and I stay where
I used to stay, nothing's changed
Everything keeps haunting me
How long more? How long more?
I am haunted, I am fretted
I'm followed by my despair
I breathe like dragged under the water
Who I am now?
Haunted, haunted, haunted
It's a full moon and I stay where
I used to stay, nothing's changed
Everything keeps haunting me
How long more? How long more?
It's a full moon and I stay where
I used to stay, nothing's changed, changed
It's a full moon and I stay where
I used to stay, nothing's changed, changed
Haunted, haunted
I breathe like dragged under the water<start>The wheels are in place
So set them away
To see them in motion
Will see us replaced
And change will keep us from changing
As we step to the side
And stay stuck in the station
Where we're sure we're all right
Take this moment's more
Would it be the same
If we had the time?
But when is there ever enough
That same old stuff?
And change keeps us from changing
As we step to the side
And is it really our own makin'?
Makin'
Take this moment's more<start>[Here we go]
Yo ho ho, I'm good to go
Hypin' on the mic cause God said so
He said, "Yo, go out and fish for men"
A genuine commission that put us in
To tell you about our Savior and Lord
So if you wonder what's up well, you're in store
For more than a happy, go-lucky tune
About Christmas and how it's coming soon
This song will tell ya how it all began
And how man [oh man] seemed to change that plan
Know this to be true in black and white
God's Word said so so you know that's right
It's Christmas time
(chorus)
Yo! Ho! Ho! Ho! [repeat 3x]
We're good to go
[repeat 2x]
A Benz pulled up figured it was dis
So on twelve twenty-fifth give me all the gifts
I mean, each year Christmas rolls around
For mucho gifts the T was down
[From] stereo, mixers, to microphones
I caused pops to take ridiculous loans
Until a few years back I attended a play
About Christmas and it went this way:
People were illin' all across the land
It was tax season and the king had a plan
He sent all the people back to where they were born
For a census which I'm sure they adored
As we move down the line things start to get hairy
God chose Joseph and a virgin named Mary
By this time I was on the edge of my pew
But hold up I gotta break for a few
(repeat chorus)
(bridge)
It's Christmas time
And all the gifts I find
But true love is
Found in Jesus Christ
Gloria
[It ain't jingle bells, baby]
Mary was a virgin but laden with child
Yo doc! [yes?] ponder that for a while
They grabbed a couple of mules started across the land
Their destination was called Bethlehem
Ya know, night had fallen they arrived in a fix
Cause every inn was full even Motel 6 [word!]
They got it goin' on in the west side of town
It wasn't quite home but they had a bed down
On this very night she delivered a babe
It was a boy [God's Son] comin' into the world to save
And unbind mankind from a serious debt
Called sin that God couldn't forget
Without sendin' His Son as a gift to man
He lived to be thirty-three and then died
For the plan of salvation so the choice is yours
The true gift of Christmas ain't found in stores
Yo, where's little drummer boy?
(repeat chorus)<start>(instrumental)<start>--------
My strings beats upon the chest
My chest beats upon the heart
My heart beats upon the blood
My blood doesn't flow to my brain,
I can tell because I'm getting cold,
I haven't lived and I'm feeling old
And when I talked to her she said no.
My brain beats upon the pillow,
My pillow beats upon the bed,
My bed beats upon the ocean
As she drifts away from me,
As I float into the sea,
As she is fading into the light,
As day turns into night.<start>I don't need a whole lot of money
But I wouldn't turn a lottery down
I just need a little green in my pocket
So I can buy my buddies a round
All I want is a place to lay my head
With the woman I love lyin' in my bed
Kind of understated
My dreams aren't that complicated
I wanna be the one
When all is said and done
Who lived a good life, loved a good wife
And always helped someone in trouble
On the day they lay me down
I want everyone to gather 'round
And say, 'He was a father, brother, neighbor and a friend
He was a good man'
Used to dream of being a rock star
And seein' the world in style
Used to dream of havin' a fast car
And driving that miracle mile
But I've heard tell those streets aren't paved in gold
They're full of pot holes and empty souls
Who never learn
Love is something you gotta earn
I wanna be the one
When all is said and done
Who lived a good life, loved a good wife
And always helped someone in trouble
On the day they lay me down
Want everyone to gather 'round
And say, 'He was a father, brother, neighbor and a friend
He was a good man'
When I'm gone, I wanna leave a legacy
Of love and laughs and honesty behind me, behind me
I wanna be the one
When all is said and done
Who lived a good life, loved a good wife
And always helped someone in trouble
On the day they lay me down
Want everyone to gather 'round
And say, 'He was a father, brother, neighbor and a friend
He was a good man'
Yeah, I wanna be a good man
A father, a brother, a neighbor and a friend
I wanna be a good man<start>Now his intentions unfold, they're not what they seem
He only wants to take control
Boy is he selling you loads, all you do is concede
Grant him his black eyed fantasies
He claims that he knows you, says it written in the stars
Do you believe this bullshit?
Tell me you don't want to face this situation anymore than I do
You think it's so great, keep it up at this rate
You're bound to catch it if you wait
I've seen the symptoms before, they come as they please
Here comes the low rent man again
He'll claim that he knows you, says it written in the stars
Will you believe this bullshit?
Tell me you don't want to face this situation anymore than I do
So what does he have in store, does he need you to bleed?
Inadequate in all he breathes
He claims that he knows you, says it written in the stars
Do you believe this bullshit?
If you don't want to face this situation anymore, then I don't<start>I took myself a blue canoe
And I floated like a leaf
Dazzling, dancing
Half enchanted
In my Merlin sleep
Crazy was the feeling
Restless were my eyes
Insane they took the paddles
My arms they paralysed
So where to now St. Peter
If it's true I'm in your hands
I may not be a Christian
But I've done all one man can
I understand I'm on the road
Where all that was is gone
So where to now St. Peter
Show me which road I'm on
Which road I'm on
It took a sweet young foreign gun
This lazy life is short
Something for nothing always ending
With a bad report
Dirty was the daybreak
Sudden was the change
In such a silent place as this
Beyond the rifle range
I took myself a blue canoe<start>Worked with a woman named Minnie
One Christmas eve long ago
When I asked "What you doing this evening ?"
Minnie took on a seasonal glow
She said she'd be waiting for Santa
She'd be wearing a bright red bow
[Chorus:]
Minnie And Santa
Minnie And Santa
What they're up to only
Heaven knows she wrote on a card
"Don't take it so hard we're headed for the North Pole"
Now Minnie could not be persuaded
That Santa just did not exist
She swore if she put up some mistletoe
Santa did come give her a kiss
And there where she'd hung up her stockings
All in their silky, soft, sheen
She'd be laying in wait on a bear skin rug
Where the cookies and milk could be seen
Minnie And Santa
Minnie And Santa
What they're up to only
Heaven knows she wrote on a card
"Don't take it so hard we're headed for the North Pole"
Now Minnie was older and wiser
Like a dear old Auntie to me
But the night that she ran off with Santa
Was a real epiphany
Minnie And Santa
Minnie And Santa
What they're up to only
Heaven knows she wrote on a card
"Don't take it so hard we're headed for the North Pole"
Next Xmas I passed by the bakery
Staring out from on top of a cake
Was jolly old Santa with a big silly grin
And a gal in silk stockings and lace
Oh, Minnie and Santa...<start>[Chorus]
Do ya head like this, do ya head like this
Do ya head like this, do ya head like this
Do ya head like this, do ya head like this
Now gas break dip dip, gas break dip dip
Do ya head like this, do ya head like this
Do ya head like this, do ya head like this
Do ya head like this, do ya head like this
When I told ya I had a white gurl
I thought y'all was gonna hurl
Y'all looked sick but the bitch still suck on my dick
{ohh}
But to all my niggaz in the pin and some waiting to get it in
I want all y'all niggas to
[Chorus]
This is a discipline rap for my niggaz back in tha bin
Tryin to hustle for the tin
A discipline tracks for my niggaz that rap
But now I'm back and I hope ya don't do that
Soul is the heart of it I hope I can get every lil bit of it
But sometimes ya gotta slow it down
Like the few Mc's that do shows in my town
Back in 2000 the rap game was lackin'
Like some of them rappers bringin' two steps back in
But today is the day for hunger in the game
It ain't bout the fame its all about the brains
And if you got that and yo rhymes are phat
Gone on head and do that
But ya always gotta think
Ohh you thought I stopped rappin
Put yo money back in the bank on my rank I'm numba 1
You is numba two I don't know what cha gone do
Ya gotta think it threw but too all my Mc's
Back in the game this shit it like it was back in the day
I'm bout to throw the fist all my hoes do ya head like this {ohh}
[Chorus]
Check it out now
My boy doe just ripped it
Sip it smoke it do sumthin' wid it
Get suppa sick wid it
Girl I'm headin' to tha south
I really want you to head down south if you know what I mean
Use you're mouth like you're in a bath ridin' on a rath
But to all my niggaz in the pin and some waiting to get it in
I want all y'all niggas to
[Chorus]
Super hyipihe in this bitch smokin' on da litch
Throw that bitch right back in that nasty ass ditch
X on my side slab on my phab my car shoot bullets
Like the arm of Donavaon Mccnabb but think fast hoe
Four-four gone blow me and E-40 we got all the dough
But my boy doe he git it to he hustlin' at fourteen
Tryin to get a wagur too
[Chorus]<start>Tell me how could you compromise
Yourself like this?
Tell me how could you blame anyone else
When you aren't really committed?
Tell me where was your head
When you broke that promise to yourself,
The one where you don't forget
Every life lesson that happend before your eyes
So you don't wake up to regret she's gone years away?
You had hopes and dreams of a day
Where everything, everything, everything would come together,
You wouldn't have to be so scared.
Are we just working till a day we decide we've had enough?
All along
We were strong enough
To be sick of it,
And put them back in their fucking place.
Never asked for this responsibility
We were never in this...
Together.
The reality that you know
Is just behind your idea
Of a society, security, and self.
Am I just fucked up?
'Cause I can't remember
The last time any of this made sense,
The last time I
Could stand up to myself.
Street faces all blend into one,
They ask for spare change.
Am I forgetting
What it looks like
From the other side?
Have I forgotten where I've come from?
Are we just working till a day we decide we've had enough?
All along
We were strong enough
To be sick of it,
And put them back in their fucking place.
Never asked for this responsibility
We were never in this...
Together...<start>Sky is clear tonight
Sky is clear tomorrow
A star is out
I reach for one to sparkle in my hand
A star is out
I will not touch you, I am just a man
Sky is clear tonight
Sky is clear tomorrow
- And every night I shut my eyes
So I don't have to see the light
Shining so bright
I'll dream about a cloudy sky, a cloudy sky
"Man was born to love -
Though often he has sought
Like Icarus, to fly too high.
And far too lonely than he ought
To kiss the sum of east and west
And hold the world at his behest -
To hold the terrible power
To whom only gods are blessed -
But me, I am just a man"
- And every night I shut my eyes
So I don't have to see the light
Shining so bright
I'll dream about a cloudy sky, a cloudy sky
And every night I shut my eyes
But now I've got them open wide
You've fallen into my hands
And now you're burning me
You're burning me<start>I wanted love so very bad that
I could almost tasted it
And so I gave my all to you
And hoped you would not wast it
I laid awake the whole night long
And wondered was I wrong
But when you woke and touched my face
I knew that I belonged
Belonging to someone I find is very necessary
The load is lighter on your mind
When someone helps to carry
And even though I'm strong enough
To make it on my own
I would not even care to try
To live my life alone
For if I lived my life alone
With no one to belong to
There'd be no one to pledge my heart
Or sing my song of love to
My melodies would soon dry up
And the words would leave me too
It all would come to pass if I
Could not belong to you
I wanted love so very bad that
I could almost taste it
And when I gave mine all to you
I knew you would not wast it<start>Forever lost in comparisons
Between you and the better man
Yeah you're always so quick
To take a bow
I've got to laugh at your circus sympathy
And your postcard sincerity
Don't you ever get tired
Of being yourself
It's getting so hard to find you
As you fade into your world of reprisal
As you slip into the comfort
Of your denial
Your patriotic smile
Your go down in style
And you say that you're not to blame
Yeah you're proud of what you did
And you'd do it again
All in the name of God and country
But that's too bad about the little snag
Cause getting caught is such a drag
Even in the name of God and country
Still you're all the same to me
You're just trying to make points on national TV
Yeah you try to make points for God
God and country
You call this justice
I call this self-service
Solo
And I hope that I never find
What you call good conscience
Or peace of mind
As another man dies for God and country
'Cause I'm sure while you're sitting there talking
Well the bombs are falling
All in the name
All in the name
All in the name of God and country<start>All rise for the commandant as he addresses from the promenade, hold tight
We were having such a fine time
We were covered in a sweet rime, all right
But they got it all wrong at the FSO
Got us wound so taught that we're champing to go
Now we're all broke loose and we're coming on
It fits and starts
It fits and starts
It fits and starts
Fits and fits and fits and starts
I was watching on the apparat
Some comely little apparatchik felled
We were having such a fine time
We were sweating out a sweet rime, unshelled
But they got it all wrong at the FSO
Got us wound so taught that we're champing to go
Now we're all broke loose and we're coming on
It fits and starts
It fits and starts
It fits and starts
Fits and fits and fits and starts
Fits and starts<start>You're nocturnal, only come out at night
And i'm learning all the ways you wanna ride
Cause you're on the road
But not until the darkness arrives
And i'm certain i'll catch up to you one of these times baby, oh
Can i get my hands on you tonight (I must be feelin' something)
Something tells me i'm in for a ride (I wonder if u see me coming)
Can i get my hands on you tonight (Tonight has got me running)
Something tells me i'm in for a ride (I'm riding into your night-time world)
Night runner, i think i'm falling for you
Night runner, you got a spell that put me under
Night runner, what you gonna do with it now
Night runner, night, night runner
Night scatters when you walk into the room
I'm the shadow i can feel the heat in you
Should i be surprised?
I feel the possibility
Moving right across to me
It all matters when i'm getting close to you
Yeah yeah, aha
Can i get my hands on you tonight (I must be feelin' something)
Something tells me i'm in for a ride (I wonder if u see me coming)
Can i get my hands on you tonight (Tonight has got me running)

Night runner, i think i'm falling for you
Night runner, you got a spell that put me under
Night runner, what you gonna do with it now
Night runner, night, night runner
Love is haunting, she want it to go, it's what she told me
Love is haunting, she want it to go
Night runner, i think i'm falling for you
Night runner, you got a spell that put me under
Night runner, what you gonna do with it now
Night runner, night, night runner
Night runner, i think i'm falling for you
Night runner, you got a spell that put me under
Night runner, what you gonna do with it now
Night runner, night, night runner<start>I find myself a child again
Asleep in Baby Lotion
The air was thick
With Scalextric
And the cars were in slow motion
Going up like an air bubble caught in a vein
Going down like a thermos flask thrown from a train
You go ahead, and I'll follow my phobia down
I cried myself to sleep because
They wouldn't leave the light on
I clawed the rails
With broken nails
Now there's nothing left to bite on
Going up like an air bubble caught in a vein
Going down like a thermos flask thrown from a train
You go ahead, and I'll follow my phobia down
Going up like the corners of Dali's moustache
Going down like the United in the Munich air crash
You go ahead and I'll follow my phobia down
Splendour in the grass
Freeze Frame
A splintering of glass
Steam train
Stop you're going too fast
Please Freeze Frame
Frame, Freeze Frame, Freeze Frame
Please Freeze
I asked my mum about the stains in the kitchen
She said, "Bang you're dead" and truth is stranger than fiction
Truth is stranger than fiction
I find myself designing rooms that
Never let the light in
With no way in and
No way out
And a space to fly my kite in
Going up like an air bubble caught in a vein
Going down like a thermos flask thrown from a train
You go ahead, and I'll follow my phobia down
Going up like a body rejecting a heart
Going down like Neanderthal Man in the chart
You go ahead and I'll follow my phobia down<start>So you want to be a rock 'n roll star
Then listen now to what I say
Just get an electric guitar
And take some time and learn how to play
And when your hair's combed right
And your pants fit tight
It's gonna be all right
Then it's time to go down town
Where the agent man won't let you down
Sell your soul to the company who are waiting there
To sell plastic ware and in a week or two
If you make the charts
The girls will tear you apart
Gotta pay for your riches and fame
Was it all a strange game
You're a little insane
The money that came and the public acclaim
Don't forget who you are
You're a rock 'n roll star
Repeat last verse
La la la la la la la<start>How did the cat get so fat?
A fork in the middle of my road
causin me to make a choice beyond my comfort zone.
Which path will I choose?
Which way will I go?
My mind is overloading and ready to explode.
Sit and contemplate
about every single path that I'm about to take.
How it controls my fate.
Will I pass for me?
I wanna take the path thats gonna set me free.
A fork in the middle of my road
causin me to make a choice beyond my comfort zone.
Which path will i choose?
Which way will i go?
My mind is overloading and ready to explode.
Sit and contemplate
about every single path that I'm about to take.
How it controls my fate.
Will I pass for me?
I wanna take the path thats gonna set me free.
Sit and contemplate
about every single path that I'm about to take.
How it controls my fate.
Will I pass for me?
I wanna take the path thats gonna set me free.
Sit and contemplate
about every single path that I'm about to take.
How it controls my fate.
Will I pass for me?
I wanna take the path thats gonna set me free.
Thanks to Gregory H. for these lyrics<start>One morn I awakened
A new sun was shining
The sky was a Kingdom
All covered in blood
The moon and the stars
Where the troops that lay conquered
Like fruit left to wither
Poor spiritual food
And the spears of bright sun
All brave with it conquest
Did hover unearthly
In banners of fire
I kneit in the garden
Awash with the dawning
And a voice came so brightly
I covered my eyes
Thank you for giving
This bright new morning
So steeped seemed the evening
In darkness and blood
There'll be no sadness
There'll be no sorrow
There'll be no road too narrow
There'll be a new day
And it's today
For us<start>Lock your lips on eastern time,
Bleed my heart, I'm leaving mine.
See my soul makes it home.
I'm high on wretched wine.
Spinning here alone.
I left you on the street,
With a face so long, that it touched your feet.
I am a leaver.
Is my time wasting well?
I am a leaver.
I haven't landed since I fell
Roaming streets, I've never found.
Singing songs, without a sound.
Cannot shake you from the tree,
And sow you in the ground.
Keep you next to me.
You left me in defeat,
With a loss so great, that I can't retreat.
I am a leaver,
Is my time wasting well?
I am a leaver,
I haven't landed since I fell.
*Guitar*
Treasures dropped in the sea.
Lovers leap, like you and me.
I am a sucker and a sin.
But baby, I believe, in no effigy.
I left you on the street,
With a face so long, that it touched your feet.
I am a leaver.
Is my time wasting well?
I am a leaver.
I haven't landed since I fell.
I am a leaver,
I am a shaken, battered shell.
I am a leaver,
I am a liar, can't you tell?
Can't you tell?
Can't you tell?<start>Oh wee
My darlin
Can I make love to you tonight
Sweetheart
I will do you right
I can make you feel so good
I'm in the mood to make love tonight<start>For this second of your life,
Tell me that its true,
Waiting for a sign,
That's all I want of you.
Your heart hides a secret
A promise of what is,
Something more than this.
Just a second of your time,
Any one will do,
Taste of any other,
Is all I want from you,
You offer me the world,
And how can I resist
Something more than this?
Make believe in magic
Make believe in dreams
Make believe impossible,
Nothing as it seems
To see touch taste smell hear
But never know if its real
For this second of your life
Tell me if its true
Anyway we are
Is all I want of you
Your lips lies a secret
A promise of a kiss
Something more than this
Just a second of your time
Any one will do
To know any other is all I want for you
Giving me the world
Now I can't resist
Something more than this
Make believe in magic
Make believe in dreams
Make believe impossible
Nothing as it seems
Never really understand what anything means
Another second of my life
Not knowing if its true
Make believe in nothing
Is all I want of you
Whisper me your secret
Whisper me your ears
Always something other
Something more than this...<start>Let it burn in your eyes, your cover is blown this time and you know
But you know this was gonna happen and you could taste the red hands
And like the flies, you'll eat the worst of everything
But you know this was gonna happen, you could taste the red hands
But you needed this
You needed this
You needed this
You needed this
There's a glossary of dirty words for people just like you
And only for people like you, I reserve the words
Backstabbers and money whores and dirty rotten millionaires
That always wanted more
Pull the wool on my eyes, like a crooked, burnt out saint
I believed and soaked in every word you said
Always tasting red hands but the fight never ended and we're all here
Singing loud for revolution and sitting battles out
But you needed this
You needed this
You needed this
You needed this
There's a glossary of dirty words for people just like you
And only for people like you I reserve the words
Backstabbers and money whores and dirty rotten millionaires
That always wanted more
And it's sick outside but I'm trying to keep you alive
And it's sick outside but I'm trying to keep you alive
And it's sick outside but I'm trying to keep you alive
There's a glossary of dirty words for people just like you
And only for people like you I reserve the words
Backstabbers and money whores and dirty rotten millionaires
That always wanted more
And all fingers are pointing right at you
And all fingers are pointing right at you
And all fingers are pointing right at you
But I burned this down for you<start>There's something about the way
You look tonight
I don't know exactly what it is
I know when you had it all you stared
Up and to the right
As if to ask forgiveness
For all the nasty things that you did
I love you,
But I don't wanna do this anymore
I need ya, to be happy
I just have to ignore, my feelings
I've been hurt too bad too many times before
But I can't stay away
I just keep coming back for more, baby
Sometimes you make me feel special, oh no
Sometimes you make me wanna die inside
You're leaving me too far gone,
Dragged away from love
I know that I want you, oh
But I need more room to fly up so much higher above
Something about the way
You feel tonight
I don't know exactly what it is
Your skin's too soft for comfort and your
Your hair's too dark for night,
And your eyes look like they wanna take and never give
Oh, but I love you, I don't wanna do this anymore
Well I need ya, to be happy
I just have to ignore, my feelings
I've been hurt too bad too many times before
But I can't stay away
I just keep coming back for more, baby
Sometimes you make me feel special, oh no
Sometimes you make me wanna die inside
You're leaving me too far gone,
Dragged away from love
I know, yes I know that I want you
But I need more room to fly up so much higher above
I need more room to fly up so much higher above
I know that I love you baby
Let everybody see
You know that I'm your man
And there's nobody better than me
I said I know that I love ya baby,
You can let everybody see,
You know that I'm your man
And there's nobody better than me
So, so, don't go running 'round on me,
Don't ya go running 'round on me
I'm all that you, all that you'll ever need
No, don't you go running 'round, don't ya go running 'round on me
'Cause I'm, I'm all that you,
I'm all that you, I'm all that you'll ever need
Oh, no
Don't you go running,
Don't you go running round, no
Baby, 'cause I, 'cause I
Oh, 'cause I love you
And I don't wanna do this anymore
Well I need ya, to be happy
I just have to ignore, my feelings
I've been hurt too bad too many times before
But I can't stay away
I just keep coming back for more, baby
Sometimes you make me feel special, oh no
Sometimes you make me wanna die inside
You're leaving me too far gone,
Dragged away from love
I know, yes I know that I want you
But I need more room to fly up so much higher above
I need more room to fly up so much higher above<start>From sleeping visions
Daily were torn
In waking hours
Hopes our forlorn.
Is all we do and all we dream
Doomed to drown in a hopeless stream?
Wishing life were made of lasting visions
In eternal sleep
And if that rest were filled with sorrow
Still we'd sleep.
In the madness of a silent eternity
We'd find solace in
False visions that protect us
From reality.
Enter ivory gates through midnight skies
Daylight dreamers in private parades
Perform before perpetual dawn
As dusk engulfs the gate of horn.<start>And as a matter of fact
There's a time and a place we can both trace back to
Maybe a concert hall
Playing rock-n-roll or a hole-in-the-wall, too
Through a crowded room we shared a drink or two
Yeah, we had a good laugh
I could tell that I liked you
And when the night shut down
I said so long, man
I hope to see you around
[Chorus:]
Old friend of mine
Old friend of mine
How I hope to see you on down the line
If you're passing by
Man, I hope you come say hello sometime
It's you, and all the people I meet
Here and along the way
Oh, they stay in my passenger seat
Maybe a year will pass
Before I see you again
But if you're nearby come see me
[Chorus:]
Old friend of mine
Old friend of mine
How I hope to see you on down the line
If you're passing by
Man, I hope you come say hello sometime
Hey, 'til the next time comes around
I wish you well
Hey, 'til the next time comes around
I wish you well
Hey, 'til the next time comes around
I wish you well
Hey....<start>Watching your window
Across the street we share
Eyes on your shadow
You are unaware, unaware
Picture a stranger
Footsteps in gabardine
You sense the danger
Something unforeseen
Burning fires on your shore
Never opened any door
I'm wasting my time
You don't hear my S.O.S.
The perfect crime
To answer your S.O.S.
Leave you in silence
Change my identity
Second appearance
I will set you free
Burning fires on your shore
Never opened any door<start>Verse 1:
We confess our dreams are way too small
God for who You are
You're beyond expectations
We're crying out for restoration here
You are the God who saves
You're beyond limitations
Chorus:
Sun stand still
Oceans part
Nothing is too hard
Nothing is too hard
Refuge for the weak
Strong and mighty
Nothing is too hard
Nothing is too hard
Verse 2:
Within us, the spirit who raised Christ
Victor over death
You're the God of resurrection
More than we could ask or imagine
This promise is ours
The hope of our salvation
Chorus
Bridge:
We believe, we believe that You are God
Nothing is too hard

It's been 37 years since James dies on St. Patrick's Day in 1964,
but she could not hold it against him.
There were times when there was nothing she could do but lie in bed all day beside a picture of them together...
A picture of better days...
And just like James, I'll be drinking Irish tonight
and the memory of his last work week wil be gone forever...
Evelyn I'm not coming home tonight,
if we're never together
if I'm never back again
well I swear to god that I'll love you forever
Evelyn I'm not coming home tonight...
In all the years that went by she said she'd always love him
and from the day that he died she never loved again.
In his wallet she kept in her nightstand an A.A. card and a lock of red hair.
She kept secrets of pride locked so tight in her heart

Hablo con la nada, cuento mis desgracias, escucho a mi silencio. Me ro de mi llanto, desprecio a mi pesar, sufro soledad.
Trato de olvidar, trato de vivir, no mirar atrs.
Cul es mi destino, dnde debo ir, dnde no ests t?
Supongo que este trance no va a ser eterno
como el tiempo. Ese tiempo viejo, maestro de castigos y de olvidos.
Trato de olvidar, trato de vivir, no mirar atrs.

Y quiero que me expliquen, que me den motivos,
me justifiquen el llanto con la risa, la muerte
con la vida.
Y soy un loco triste, que se arrepiente, que no se entiende. Y soy un loco triste que cuando piensa,
no se defiende.

Who could care at all about the trouble you send me?

So it took me by complete surprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was looking for
She's more
No, it wasn't at first sight
But the moment I looked twice
I saw the woman I was born to love
Her laughter fills my soul
And when I hold her I don't want to let go
When it comes to her I can't get enough
So it took me by complete surprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was looking for
She's more
More than I dreamed of
More than any man deserves
I couldn't ask for more
Than a love like hers

I looked in the mirror, I looked in the hall
In my slippers and my dressing gown
There were lipstick traces on the bedroom door
Goodbye she wrote, I don't want you no more
I guess I'm not the man she was looking for
But just the man she found
Well I'm standing at the crossroads again

Long black hair and sugar sweet
Daddy's eyes and Momma's crooked smile
She was barely seventeen
Got a job keepin' dishes clean
Planned to stay in this city for a while
For a while
Joseph ran a lumber yard
About a mile from Olive park
Quiet boy, he never had much to say
It was love right from the start
He bought a ring and won Mary's heart
Had hopes for a home and kids someday
Kids someday
The angel scared her half to death
She would've screamed but she lost her breath
On a midnight there in the middle of May
He said "Oh Mary, don't be afraid
You'll bear a son that the Lord has made
Name him Jesus, He'll light the way"
She packed the clothes, he made the plans
They had to go to Bethlehem
But there was nowhere left to stay
So in a barn she gave birth
To the King of Kings, the Lord of Earth
Just a little bitty thing sleeping on the hay
Sleeping on the hay
The story's too long to tell
But He walked on water and lived through hell
Killed on a cross and rose from the grave
We got a King, they got a Son
Mary and Joseph were the only ones
There on that very first Christmas day
There on that very first Christmas day<start>Let's tap your heart
So, we can paint the walls
And see if anybody likes the tone
(Or the pain)
The hungry eyes
Waiting for your life flash
Now, they're gonna see it
(Now, they're gonna see it)
Open your veins
So, we can make a pool and bathe
And see if anyone complains
(Of the stain)
Let's strip you down
So, we can see your old scars
Now, you're gonna feel it
(Now, you're gonna feel it)
Show me how to shine now
Have you turned, turned to dust?
I saw an insect learn to fly
Have you ever seen the kingdom of the flies?
(It's form was scorned)
Have you lost the sense of touch?
I saw it stay in sovereignty
Have you ever turned to dust?
Let's lift you up
So, we can see how fast you fall
We always thought that you could fly
(Now, you'll crawl)
The lack of loyalty
You thought, you once felt
Now, you're gonna feel it
(Now, you're gonna feel it)
Show me how to shine now
Have you turned, turned to dust?
I saw an insect learn to fly
Have you ever seen the kingdom of the flies?

The reason for this hearing
Is not to promote any legislation,
(indeed, I don't know of any suggestion
That any legislation 'd be passed),
But to simply provide a form
For airing the issue itself,
For ventilating the issue,
For bringing it out in the public domain.
Senator hollings?
I've had the opportunity to ah,
Attend a, a showing you might say,
A presentation of ah,
This porn rock as they call it.
In the tested pornography,
One of the things to look at
Is that it does not have any redeeming social value.
Ah, there could be an exception here
Because I haven't attended that presentation.
A redeeming social value,
I find that it's inaudible.
I have a hard time understanding it.
And, paul, since I travelled the country for three years
And they said they couldn't understand me,
Maybe I could make a good rock-star, I don't know.
But in all candour I would tell you it's,
It's outrageous filth.
So I'll be looking from this senator's standpoint
Not just to bring pression,
But to try to see if there is some constitutional provision
To tax, or procedure can be used on the congress
To limit this outrageous filth.
Senator trible?
Rape, incest, it's outrageous filth...
Sexual violence
Now, the effects of such lyrics on a well adjusted child may
Not be cataclysmic
It's outrageous filth!
A lot of the emotional damage is more subtle
Fire and chains and...leather
It's outrageous filth!
Objectionable...
Tools and presentations in some twisted minds...
...effects of such lyrics on a well adjusted child may not be
Cataclysmic...
...porn rock...
A lot of the emotional damage is more subtle
Fire and chains and...leather
This must be the end of the world!
All the people turning into pigs and ponies
I can't let it happen to me!
What is the reason for these hearings...
Sex!
Well...
Sex!
Thank you, I think that statement...
Sex!
...tells the story of these many...
Listen you little slut...
What is the reason for these hearings...
Sex!
Bondage!
Listen you little slut!
Listen you little slut!
Mixture of drugs...
Sex! sex! sex! sex!...
I might be interested to see what toys your kids ever had
Why would you be interested?
Just as a point of interest in this ah...
Well, come on over to the house and I'll show them to you.
Really!
I, I might do that!
Now, the effects of such lyrics on a well adjusted child may
Not be cataclysmic
It's outrageous filth!
A lot of the emotional damage is more subtle
Fire and chains and...leather

Thank you very much, mr. zappa.
You understand that ah,
The previous witnesses were not asking for legislation
And ah, I don't know,
I can't speak for senator hollings,
But I think that the prevailing view here is
That nobody's asking for legislation.
The question is just focusing
On what a lot of people could feel that could be a problem.
And you've indicated that you at least understand
That there is another point of view.
Really nearly over the year...
Senator gore?
Thank you very much, ah, mister chairman.
I found your statement very interesting and,
Ah let me say although I disagree with
Some of the statements that you make,
And have made on other occasions
- I have been a fan of your music, believe it or not -
And i, I ah respect you as a true original and,
And ah tremendously talented musician.
Wait a minute!
Maybe I could make a good rock-star, I don't know
Comics, comics, comics daddy!
Maybe I could make a good rock-star, I don't know
Comics, comics daddy!
Maybe I could make a good rock-star, I don't know
Comics, comics, comics daddy!
They don't even understand their music...
Of course nobody does, but ah...
They don't, they don't even know what they're doing
No!
I've, I've seen 'em a couple of times...
Did you, did you see their uniforms?
Unbelievable!
Which ones? they're the red ones?
All those rhinestones of their rings and things like that
Do you know what i...
Golden may hoof-covers
Unbelievable!
Maybe I could make a good rock-star!
Gonna drive my love inside you!
Etc...
It's outrageous filth!
Comics daddy!
Etc...
Rock, rock, porn rock!
Etc...
And I think your suggestion is a good one
If you pledge those words.
That would go a long way for...
All we have to do is find out how it's gonna be paid for...
Pyromania!
No question!
Burn the building!
Burn! burn! burn!
Yeah!
If I could find some way constitutionally to do away with it I would!
This issue is too hot...
So I'll be looking from this senator's standpoint
Not just to bring pression,
But to try to see if there is some constitutional provision
To tax, or procedure can be used on the congress
To limit this outrageous filth.
Yeah!
We'll get back to de whimp

Senator gorton?
Mr. zappa, I ah, am astounded at the ah,
Courtesy and soft-voiced ah,
Nature of the comments of my friend
The senator from tennessee.
I can only say that I find your statement
To be boorish, ah, incredibly and ah,
Insensitively insulting the people who were here previously.
That you could manage
To get the first amendment
Of the constitution of the united states
A bad name - if I doubt that you have the slightest
Understanding of it - which I do not,
And have the slightest understanding of the difference between
Government action and private action.
And ah, you have certainly destroyed any case
You might otherwise have had with this senator.
Thank you mr. chairman.
Is this private action?
I don't think this is constitutional...
The voluntary labelling is not censorship...
Bend up and smell my anal vapor!
The voluntary...voluntary...voluntary...
...is not censorship...
De-de-de-de-degradation...humiliation...
Is this private action?
In chains...
Listen you little slut...
There-there-there...
There's no absolute rock...
There's no absolute rock...
Well... ... bend up and smell my anal vapor!
There-there-there...
There's no... there's no...
Mr. zappa, thank you very much for your testimony.
Thank you.
Next witness is john denver...<start>There's a house behind a house
There's a dream behind a dream
There's a heart outside a heart
There's a hope behind a hope
When two people know that it's time to go
When do they give in
At what point in time do they really find
They must let it end
Lonely faces everywhere
Watch them starin' at their hands
As the walls keep closin' in
As the days go on and on
When two people see it can never be
When do they give up
When do they concede they must let it be
Now they've had enough They've had enough<start>Like the virus in my veins
A broken window pane
Jaws are locked into place
Mingled cup thrown in my face
I live in a house of clay
Violated and dismayed
I don't want to be a dream
In somebody else's sleep
It is only when I'm left alone
That I pervert what is sown
Blood and skin beneath my nails
Reflects the emptiness of hell
Then I squirm in my bed
Pull the sheets around my head
Soaking wet in a pool of sweat
Pray for me, I'm not dead<start>Instrumental<start>I was drunk, sober, tarnished, and pure.
All I ever wanted was a little bit more,
I had eyes that were heavy and sickly and sore,blackened out windows,
And a bolt on the door,
I was shell-shocked shaking from the world outside,
I had voices come and wake me in the dead of the night,
At the end of the tunnel they say there's a light.
I hope there's more to living then just being alive.
[Chorus]
'Cause the blind truth,
It'll find you,
In the end it's all that's waiting.
Yeah the blind truth,
It'll find you,
In the end It's all that's waiting for you.
I was judge, jury and witness in one.
Put myself on trial for the things I had done.
Forced to stare and look, at now what I had become.
Cold and unforgiving like the face of a gun,
When underneath my skin I felt my blood so warm,
Waking up my senses like the day I was born.
I was the sickness,
I was the cure.
I never thought I'd ever feel so safe and secure.
[Chorus]<start>I'm gonna kick these notes
right into the streets
where they belong
to liven up deadbeats
I'm gonna suck the juice
out of this life and spit it past the stage
to fill this dull world with rage
that's quick to age and be forgotten
shove shit down your throats
I'll change more minds than votes
and live your futile dreams
your futile dreams turned rotten
if I could only live these words
for a moment
if I could only fool myself
for a moment
if I could only live these words
for a moment
if I could only feel I could
for one moment<start>Yeah

Fools are ready to believe (I need a new conspiracy)
I'm a useless parasite

And make some deeper meaning (I need a new conspiracy)
'Cos without you I'm so empty
Why do I bother breathing?
All you do, you do for me (I need a new conspiracy)
You keep my cold heart beating (I need a new conspiracy)
I'm cowering behind a screen
Anonymous - I'm nobody
If only daddy kicked my ass (I need a new conspiracy)
I might become a man at last (I need a new conspiracy)
I resent what I can't be
I've got it so bad, woe is me
In my own room, on my high-speed (I need a new conspiracy)

Yeah , but only when I'm drunk.
Yeah, only when I'm drunk
Only when I'm drunk It happens only when I'm drunk.
It goes, one for the chronic two for the amnesia
I'm that crazy white boy with the drinks in the freezer
Bust a one out, two out blitz type of rapper
That will get you out of your seat quicker than a car jacker
Sippin' colt forty fever when I'm coolin' with my people
Got ho's in east Columbus when I'm Billy D. Rico
"Cause I move like I'm smooth like Like I'm Harry Belafonte
Lookin' for them suckers that jumped my homey Le Le
All up in this bitch

But that's cause I'm old enough to do that of shit
God damn. I gotta piss
I pass the mic to Mr. Shift.
I get drunk and can't nobody whoop me
I'm trippin' it must be that brew that I was sippin'
Kickin' in, guess I shouldn't have mixed it with the Gin
'Cause when I'm laying on my back I can feel the room spin
One too many, I reckon Feelin' I got to hurl any second
Want to get up but can't move
Feels like I'm stuck in a groove
What the fuck was I trying to prove

I might fuck an ugly bitch, but only when I'm drunk.
Yeah, only when I'm drunk
Only when I'm drunk It happens only when I'm drunk.<start>I climb the ladder of those black and white keys
They take me out and into places
Some are real, some are imaginary
And though she sways between a mystery and light
She walks with me, she walks with me alone into the night
Tonight, I see the sunny moon is rising again
Three seasons passed since you were here then disappeared, a friend
Yet now exploded from its dream back in that place, oh, how it beams
And I see that you were glowing in the shadows
And you've been here all along
Ah, you never left my side and now I feel my arms grow stronger
You may forget the details and you can forget the dates but never
Forget the moment when the light revealed her face
To be poor by lack of money but by God, be rich in prize
I found my youth's desire dark within her eyes
And the tent kept breathing something and then she cried
"Hold on, we're going somewhere else tonight"
We're going somewhere else tonight, baby yeah
And my friends, they are the heroes of the loneliness that's life
And though everyone has a weakness, only some, they are defiant
While most of us can see, only a few have the gift of sight
Would you walk with me?
Would you walk with me alone into the night?
The sun is set<start>I want my innocence back
And if you can't give it to me
I will cut you down
And I will run you through
With the dagger you sharpened
On my body and soul
Before you slit me in two
And then devoured me whole
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
And if you can't pacify me
I will break your bones
You think I'm bluffing just try me
I will never forget
The words you used to ensnare me
Till my dying day
You'll suffer for this I swear
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
And I demand
You put my heart back in my hand
And wipe it clean
From the mess you made of me
And I require
You make me free from this desire
And when you leave, I'd better be the innocent
I used to be
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back

About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band
They farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed
Now Ira's folks were hungry, and their farms grew crops of weeds
But when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian
Or the Marine who went to war
Yes, call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian
Or the Marine who went to war.
They started up Iwo Jima hill, two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
And when the fight was over and Old Glory raised
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian
Or the Marine who went to war
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian
Or the Marine who went to war.
Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand
But he was just a Pima Indian - no money, no crops, no chance -
And at home nobody cared what Ira'd done, and when do the Indians dance?
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian
Or the Marine who went to war
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian
Or the Marine who went to war.
Then Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone
He died drunk early one morning, alone in the land he'd fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian
Or the Marine who went to war
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian
Or the Marine who went to war.
Yes, call him drunken Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian
Or the Marine who went to war
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian
Or the Marine who went to war.<start>Lyrics: j. joyce/n. hembley
I was a dirty little swirl little crazy girl
A runaway child in a fatherless world
And everybody tried to be the one to save me
No way it was never gonna be enough
By the way I looked and the way I talked
I was running away from the monsters in my head
You see, I'm born again
A new creation
You see, I'm born again
A new sensation
I was so blind till I saw the light
Everyday right before my eyes
And this time I'm gonna show you that I really changed
And there's a new day, where I'm coming
It's a new day, where I'm going
It's a new day, where I'm standing
It's a new day, I'll be showing you
Oh I'm born again
A new creation
You see, I'm born again
A new sensation
Know my direction cause I know where I'm coming from
So full of confidence I embrace the day with loving arms
You see, I'm born again
A new creation
You see, I'm born again
A new sensation<start>Crazy little woman go down, go down, go down, go down
Down to where the honey is sweet
Hey sweet baby go round, go round, go round, go round
Got to knock me off my feet
Lord I got the fever
Stop just 'fore I die
....No, do the same thing!
Do the same thing!
Hey little mama don't fall, fall, fall, fall
Baby I'm depending on you
Yeah, hey sweet woman you call me, call me, call me, call
For anything you want me to do
Lord I got the fever
Stop just 'fore I die
....No, do the same thing!
Do the same thing!
Oh hey!
All right
Crazy little woman go down, go down, go down, go down
Down to where the honey is so sweet
Listen sweet lady go round, go round, go round, go round
Got to knock me off my feet
I say Lord I got the fever
Won't just stop 'fore I die
....No, do the same thing!
Oh, do the same thing!
Yeah, do the same thing!
Oh, do the same thing!
Yeah, do the same thing!
Oh, do the same thing!
Yeah, the same thing!
Oh yeah<start>(But for some reason, the closer I got with her, the harder my father would try to get me to stop seeing her. It was like he didn't want me to be happy for something. Not like he would ever do that, right? He would tell me I was wasting my time with her, I should concentrate on where I'm going to college. You know, I didn't want to go to college. So when graduation came around, I saw a completely different side of him. The side I always knew was there. He would say that I was going to throw away my life and I was going to make a terrible mistake. I guess something he was familiar with. He would tell me I was going to be a loser and people wouldn't respect me. That was also the day he told me about the mistake he made, me. I guess that was supposed to scare me straight. Oh well.)
"No, you're just being selfish kid"
Selfish? You didn't even raise me. You dumped me off so you could go and make something of yourself and care about no one but yourself.
"You don't have any idea what my life was like. When I was 18 I was on my own. Supporting myself and your mother, working two jobs and going to school. You know how hard it was to watch someone else raise my son. You think it's easy to live with that decision."
Shut up, at least you were able to make a decision.
"You want to make a decision. What are you going to do? Huh? You're not going to get anywhere playing patty cake all day with that girlfriend of yours. You wouldn't be able to survive one day in the real world. You have no money, have no job, no common sense. You have no idea what it takes to survive on your own."<start>In the chilly hours and minutes
Of uncertainty
I want to be
In the warm hold of your loving mind.
To feel you all around me
And to take your hand
Along the sand,
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.
When sundown pales the sky
I want to hide a while
Behind your smile,
And everywhere I'd look, your eyes I'd find.
For me to love you now
Would be the sweetest thing,
'T would make me sing,
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.
Diddy di dee dee diddy diddy,
Diddy diddy diddy dee dee dee.
When rain has hung the leaves with tears
I want you near to kill my fears,
To help me to leave all my blues behind.
For standin' in your heart
Is where I want to be
And long to be,
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.<start>Nothing ever stays the same
Everything must change
Just take a look around you
You know it will astound you
History unfolding shows us
Good intentions pass
And a love once pledged in moonlight
Isn't guaranteed to last
Chorus:
(only your love is constant baby)
(only my love for you)
Only your love can hold us together
Only you - and everything you do
Just one kiss and my dreams come true
Only you - and everything you say
Only loving you - can make me feel this way
People who just play at love
Make loving something cheap
And it's only worth the playing if we
Play the game for keeps
The book of life has pages girl
That you and I must turn
And in every chapter in every story
Something there to learn
Repeat chorus
Love is patient, love is kind
Love is rarely ever blind
Take a look and you will find
That love is just caring
And sharing our loving together<start>Johnny Todd he took a notion
For to sail the ocean wide.
There he left his true love waiting
Weeping on the Liverpool side.
For a week she wept full sorely,
Tore her hair and wrung her hands
Till she met with another sailor
Walking on the Liverpool sands.
O fair maid why are you weeping
For your Johnny gone to sea?
If you'll wed with me tomorrow
I will kind and constant be.
I will buy you sheets and blankets,
I'll buy you a wedding ring.
You shall have a gilded cradle
For to rock you baby in.
Johnny Todd came home from sailing,
Far across the ocean wide,
There he found that his fair and false one
Was another sailor's bride.
So, all you lads who go a-sailing
For to fight the foreign foe.
Never leave your true love like Johnny,
Marry her before you go!<start>You can hide down in the alley
With your hat pulled over your eye
You can wear a wig or moustache
Or any old disguise
Well, you can change your name and your address
Even change your style of clothes
But the Shadow knows
The Shadow knows
Now, you thought you had me baffled (the shadow knows)
You thought I didn't know, hee-hee (the shadow knows)
But I know where you goin', baby (the shadow knows)
Long before you go
You can't even snap your fingers
Hee, or wiggle you toes, without the-
Shadow knows
The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows, the Shadow knows
The Shadow knows, the Shadow knows
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-the Shadow knows
The Shadow knows
I say, "Baby, stop your jiving
And your messing round"
'Cause I know what you're putting, baby, long before you put it down
You better mind your Ps and Qs
And your Ms and Ns and Os
Because the Shadow knows
The Shadow knows (the Shadow knows)<start>I've been watching you from a distance
The distance sees through your disguise
All I want from you is your hurting
I want to heal you
I want to save you from the dark
Give unto me your troubles
I'll endure your suffering
Place onto me your burden
I'll drink your deadly poison
Why should I care if they hurt you
Somehow it matters more to me
Than if I were hurting myself
Save you (save you)
I'll save you
Give unto me your troubles
I'll endure your suffering
Place onto me your burden
I'll drink your deadly poison
Fear not the flame of my love's candle
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness
Give unto me all that frightens you
I'll have your nightmares for you
If you sleep soundly
Give unto me your troubles
I'll endure your suffering
Place onto me your burden
I'll drink your deadly poison
Fear not the flame of my love's candle
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness
Give unto me all that frightens you
I'll have your nightmares for you
If you sleep soundly
Fear not the flame of my love's candle
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness<start>Mary liked to run around,
And break the hearts of all the lonely boys in town,
Again, Round and round and round she goes,
You know she proves she just don't give a damn,
For you, Ain't that so? Running on and on she stands,
You know she's living her life without a better plan, Like you.
And she just don't know, She steals the show,
It's all the same, Another boring game.
Running on and on she goes,
You know she's living her life,
But still it just won't show,
Like you, Stuck in the middle,
Not knowing it was true, you can't trust the truth,
Because the truth was just a lie, To you, To you.
And she just don't know, She steals the show,
It's all the same, Another boring game.
[Chorus]
She runs around, She runs around, She's running out on you,
She runs around, She runs around, She's running out on you,
She runs around, She runs around, There's nothing you can do,
She runs around, She runs around, She's running out on you.
I don't know what Mary's gonna do,
Then she's standing in the rain,
She says she only sings the blues,
And down and down and out she goes,
And she leaves, Behind her broken heart,
Her broken bones, For you, And stuck in the middle,
Not knowing what she's done, And you can't trust yourself,
And you know it's just the same old one, Was just a lie, To you, To you.
And she just don't know,
She steals the show,
It's all the same,
Another boring game.
[Chorus]
Mary liked to run around,
And break the hearts of all the lonely boys in town,
Again, Round and round and round she goes,
You know she proves she just don't give a damn, For you, For you.
And she just don't know,
She steals the show,
It's all the same,
Another boring game.
[Chorus]
And I don't know what Mary's gonna do.<start>You wanna feel that high
You wanna break that glass
You wanna push that gas
Grab that wheel yes roll that die
You wanna feel that push
You wanna cross that side
You wanna hit that clutch
Touch that nerve yes break that line
Ain't no looking back my baby
They're only trying to tame me
If they wanna fight
Well I'll be warring them
But I'm not the one to defend
You don't got to lie
Just keep going faster babe faster babe
Why, whoa whoa whoa yeah
I'm on your side
Just keep going faster babe faster bye bye
You wanna feel that rush
You wanna break that law
Highlight that flaw
Pull that stick shift then take off
You wanna make them gasp
You gotta feel what's wrong
Put your gum on the dash
Rear view glance both eyes to the past
Ain't no turning back my baby
They're on their track to take me
They wanna fight
Well I'll be warring them
But, I'm not the one to defend
You don't got to lie
Just keep going faster babe faster babe
Why, whoa whoa whoa yeah
I'm on your side
Just keep going faster babe faster bye bye
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Put your tears away
Ain't no fear today

Take the keys

You don't got to lie
Just keep going faster babe faster babe
Why, whoa whoa whoa yeah

You just gotta speed a little faster when you drive<start>I got a place that I like to slip off to
When everything starts closin' in
And I got some ways that the world don't agree with
Yeah some folks would call it a sin
But I work like a dog and I'm good at my job
And I live for a one-day weekend
So I'm takin' off and I might stay a week
Hell I may never come back again
I need a breather, a sweet senorita
Writin' my name in the sand
I need a break from this job and this angry boss man
Some coconut lotion, a chair by the ocean
Just sit back and take it all in
I got the fever and I need a breather again
The people at work they think I'm a loner
But I need some time to myself
And I don't want to waste my precious vacation
Livin' for somebody else
'Cause I'll have a drink and I might fall down
And I don't think that they'd understand
I know it all sounds a little bit crazy
Well maybe that's just what I am
I need a breather, a sweet senorita
Writin' my name in the sand
I need a break from this job and this angry boss man
Some coconut lotion, a chair by the ocean
Just sit back and take it all in
I got the fever and I need a breather again
Things fell apart down at the office
And I'm getting blamed for it all
I've only been back for a couple of days
And I'm already climbin' the wall
Hey I need a breather, a stiff margarita
Bring 'em as fast as you can
'Cause I need a break from this job and this angry boss man
Some coconut lotion, a chair by the ocean
Just kick back and take it all in
Yeah I got the fever, I need a breather again
I got the fever and I need a breather again
Yes I do<start>She has seen me changing
It ain't easy rearranging
And it gets harder as you get older
Farther away as you get closer
And I don't know the answer
Does it even matter?
I'm wonderin' how
Ten years singing right out loud
I never looked was anybody listening
Then I fell out of a cloud
Hit the ground and noticed something missing
Now I have someone
She has seen me changing
And it gets harder as you get older
Farther away as you get closer
And I don't know the answer
Does it even matter?
I'm wonderin' how
Seems like something out of a dream
I had years ago, yes I remember screaming
Nobody laughing, all the good times
Getting harder to come by without weeping<start>Lies and reason you give
Too much is not enough
Leave, what you see leave alone
Someone else to go
Romance holds you to tea, yeah
Sip it like you're typical
My love is what you make of it
Brothers and sisters, it's not enough
Not enough
Talk, call, talking of leading the way
Won't ya give any lie?
Of all the ways
Won't ya lie with me?
Man, I've no Raven to see here
Flies the blackest way
What you give when you get nothing
Is everything you give
All been tossed away
Read, light your morning candles
Make your way
All wise men today grieve
It knows no better thing
All I leave here, a way to send you all down, down, down
All my worries is where the girl will be found, found, found
All my worries of all those things that I dreamed and dreamed and dreamed
All I leave is, I have to say
It's nothing more than my point of view
It's hard and cold tonight
You're warming by a fire
Oh, sweet juice
Drink tonight
Take me while I'm out
No, no Raven to see here
It imitates beauty well
Black bird from a dark Heaven
Oh, won't you keep living a lie
All God tossed away
Read while you know
You know things fade to grey
Oh, what came of grace
Oh, the morning and the rain
All my worries warn enough to roam, roam, roam
Fade away here, the girl will go round and round and round
Hey, love
What was the greatest thing you
Moments in the cold rain
Here to say there's nothing great that you wouldn't do
Fly, Raven
Won't you guide me?
Oh, what's the reason?
Won't you guide me?
Wait, now, what is the Raven?
Won't you come to me?
What you did with the same grace at all
Won't you keep living a lie
All been tossed away
Read all you'll have ever known
I believe
All I know today
Read all to believe<start>Yes the nights are so long, baby, and the days are so blue
Seems like everything has gone wrong
Baby 'cause I'm without you
I guess this is that awful feeling
Baby that feeling they call the blues
All by myself baby, yes I began to weep
Yes, and when I dry my eyes, baby
You know I still can't sleep
Yes, I guess this is the feeling
Baby the feeling they call the blues
Yes as I sit here in my dark room, woman
With the tears running down my face
Yes as I sit here in my dark room, woman
With the tears running down my face
Yes I can feel and I can see you, woman
I can see you all over the place
Yes, then I start walkin', woman
Start walkin' all over the floor
Yes, my heart is telling me, woman
Tellin' me you won't be here no more
Oh, I guess this is the feeling
Baby the feeling, the feeling they call the blues<start>These past few weeks
I've been confused
Sometimes I wonder if
I'm better off alone.
You fall in love
Then break your heart.
You fall in love again
Its never ending.
I used to have this friend
Who took his fiance
To see billy idol
A couple weeks before
Their wedding day.
The chick got backstage
And left my friend outside.
Next day he called
From a hotel
Asking for a ride.
I guess I'm giving up on love (x3)
'cause it really kind of sucks
Uninspired
And growing tired
Why am I always
So attracted to drama?
So here I am
Grown up at 23
Will someone tell me
What it takes to be happy?
I play in my band
And write a lot of songs
About relationships
And how mine went wrong.
Maybe I'll meet that special
Girl along the way
Then she'll break my heart
And leave me crying.<start>When you look into his eyes, it comes to you as no surprise
It's always the same
Ev'ry time he's out with you he tries to tell you what to do
You don't need it that way
Sometimes you think you're playin' the fool
he's runnin' around breakin' all the rules
Somehow that don't seem fair
There's got to be a better way
you know what I'm try'n' to say
'Cause I hope you're with me
I hope you're with me when it's over
Doo doo doo doo I hope you're with me
I hope you're with me when it's over
Doo doo doo doo You won't be lonely
you won't be lonely when it's over
You won't be lonely, you when it's over
It's over, it's over, it's over!
It's over, it's over, it's over!
And in the morning when he's gone
please don't sing this same sad song
I don't wanna hear it
Forget about him, let him go
it won't hurt what he don't know
Oo What's he try'n to say to you?
What's he try'n to tell you?
He don't really care! Oo
Face the truth and realize you don't need him and his lies
No, no
I hope you're with me when it's over
Doo doo doo doo I hope you're with me
I hope you're with me when it's over
Doo doo doo doo You won't be lonely
you won't be lonely when it's over
You won't be lonely, you when it's over
It's over, it's over, it's over!
It's over, it's over, it's over!<start>Love and learn about the birds and bees and the flowers of the mystery
And if you really want to give yourself a blue love and learn about the blues
The rocky road is pretty hard to take
But you don't know nothing till your heart breaks
You want to know how much you've got to lose love and learn about the blues
Love is a game where your life gets spoken
But the game gets rough when your heart get broken
You'll say at home a sittin' all alone waitin' for the doorbell or the telephone
Then you'll know about what everyone must learn
If you play around with love your will sure to get burned
So when you go to pick a guy be careful who you choose
Or you'll love and learn about the blues
Love is a game where life gets spoken...<start>(Love come down)

I saw the ocean's daughter
Walking on a wave's chicane
Staring as she called my name
And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head
Breakdown on the shoreline

Morning, don't get here tonight
Searching for her silver light
And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head

Did they treat eachother like meat

You're not the only one
Who ever tried to make a difference
Distrust
Filling up in us
Before we know it truth and lies go hand in glove
Say what you want
Say what you want
I guess I'll see you here tomorrow
Say what you want
Say what you want
Trying to become who they think you should be
See the world through broken glass
A reach that far exceeds the grasp
And here we find ourselves at last
Full of questions we can't ask
Wound up
And now you've had enough
Never mind about tomorrow
Unfun
The thought of waking up
To realize that you were commonly mistaken
Say what you want
Say what you want
I bet I'll see you here tomorrow
Say what you want
Say what you want
Out of time the window's slamming shut on you
See the world through broken glass
A reach that far exceeds the grasp
And here we find ourselves at last
Full of questions we can't ask<start>Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweety
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow
Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic of your sighs
Will you still love me tomorrow
Tonight with words unspoken
You said that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night (when the night)
Meets the morning (meets the morning) sun
I'll like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow<start>Jennifer Juniper, lives upon the hill

Is she breathing? Yes, very low
Whatcha doing, Jennifer, my love?
Jennifer Juniper, rides a dappled mare
Jennifer Juniper, lilacs in her hair
Is she dreaming? Yes, I think so
Is she pretty? Yes, ever so
Whatcha doing, Jennifer, my love?
I'm thinking of what it would be like if she loved me
How just lately this happy song, it came along
And I like to somehow try and tell you
Jennifer Juniper, hair of golden flax

Do you like her? Yes, I do, sir
Would you love her? Yes, I would, sir

I wonder if she knows
That I am going away
I packed up
And I'm heading out the bedroom door
I'm feeling kinda guilty
But this can't be changed
Will she resent me for this
I've said, I'm sorry but please don't worry
There's nothing that I can do
I won't forget you, feel bad I left you
I promise Ill be back soon
It's been two weeks now
Since I left you at
The window with sad eyes
It's bad 'cause I can't even
Talk to you on the phone
But you know that very soon
Now I'll be home
It won't be long now
I'll see you at the break of dawn now
I'm coming home now
It won't be long now
I'll see you at the break of dawn now<start>Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves
In labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine
And no-one showed us to the land
And no-one knows the where or whys
But something stirs and something tries
And starts to climb towards the light
Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can
And no-one calls us to move on
And no-one forces down our eyes
And no-one speaks and no-one tries
And no-one flies around the sun
Cloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning
And no-one sings me lullabies
And no-one makes me close my eyes
And so I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky<start>[Chorus]
What this world needs is a few more rednecks
Some people ain't afraid to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the workin' man
We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Some good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need
I was raised on beans and cornbread
And I like my chicken fried
Yes, I drive a pickup truck
And I'm full of American pride
I keep a Bible on my table
I got a flag out on my lawn
And I don't believe in mindin'
No one's business but my own
And I love them Rambo movies
I think they make a lot of sense
And it's a shame ole John Wayne
Didn't live to run for president
[And I'm a catfish connoisseur
And I love the Lynyrd Skynyrd band
And I'm crazy about the NFL
And I'm a diehard NASCAR Fan]
And I don't care what nobody says
I don't trust ole Gorbachev
And I don't know who turned him on
But it's time to turn him off
[Chorus]
Now they're tryin' to take my guns away
And that would be just fine
If you take 'em away from the criminals first
I'll gladly give ya mine
And I don't mind payin' taxes
But it makes my temper itch
When my hard earned money goes
To make some politician rich
What most people call a redneck
Ain't nothin' but a workin' man
And he makes his livin'
By the sweat of his brow
And the calluses on his hands
Now you intellectuals may not like it
But there ain't nothin' that you can do
'Cause there's a whole lot more of us common-folks
Then there ever will be of you
[Chorus]
That's what we need
And a few more rednecks is what we need<start>Can't say I know what will happen tomorrow.
I can't say I know if its joy or sorrow.
I can't say how long I'll stand at the line that I'm towing.
But I've got a good feeling 'bout where I'm going.
All you see, a world so full of neat.
And all I need is a pocket full of seeds.
Sunflowers shooting up to a sky that is glowing.
And I've got a good feeling 'bout where I'm going.
Pray for rain; it might not come.
Can't save the day; save someone.
I can't say if the flowers will keep on growing.
But I've got a good feeling 'bout where I'm going.<start>no one but you by andy racher

7. assassination on christmas eve
Assassination shocks a nation.
When such a brutal crime is killing christmas time.
They capped the hero, under mistletoe
Unveiled the bitter sign, declared and left behind.
And no one wants to see it, 'cause no one can believe it.
A traffic cop set some strangers free, assassination on christmas eve.
And police and detectives were purely inaffecitve,
The d.a.'s resgination stands, assassination on christmas eve.
And a traffic cop let some strangers get away.
And a traffic cop let some strangers get away.
Assassination shocks a nation.
When such a brutal crime is killing christmas time.
They capped the hero, under mistletoe
Unveiled the bitter sign, declared and left behind.
And no one wants see it, 'cause no one can believe this.
The teenage revolutions planned assassination on christmas eve.
And police and detctives were purely inaffective,
The d.a.'s resgination stands, assassination on christmas eve.
And a traffic cop let some strangers get away.
And a traffic cop let some strangers get away.
And a traffic cop let some strangers get away.

meia-noite, baby
Sesso vampiro j
Pula a janela e vem.
hora de rodar
A noite chama a gente
Pra ver o que ela tem
'T todo mundo quente
Pra ver se cruza algum
Eu nem sei o seu nome
E nem quero saber
Eu sei que tenho fome
E fome de voc
Esquece o namorado
Que te respeita tanto
Quem 't aqui do seu lado
tudo menos santo
Nem pensa no marido
Que come a secretria
Eu sou muito mais bonito
E muito mais canalha
Tome um gole de gim
E suba na canoa
Como se sente assim
Dando prum tipo toa
Vamos beber, vamos transar
Eu e voc at o dia clarear
'C vai grita, vai ficar louca
S vai parar quando eu puser na
sua boca
Pode gritar, meu bem
Dizer o que pensar
Eu vou gritar tambm
At perder o ar
Crave essas unhas, baby
Faa o sangue descer
Eu mato a sua sede
s voc beber
Sangue, suor, saliva
E o que mais tiver
No cho, na mo na lngua.
Onde voc quiser

Lonely only one<start>Put on your yamulke
It's time for Chanukah
Once again it's onaka
The miracle of Chanukah
Chanukah is the Festival of Lights
One day of presents?
Hell, no, we get Eight Crazy Nights
But if you fell like the only kid in town without a Christmas tree
I guess my first two songs didn't do it for you
So here comes number three
Ross and Phoebe from Friends say the Chanukah blessing
So does Lenny's pall Squiggy and Will and Grace's Debra Messing
Melissa Gilbert and Michael Landon never mix meat with dairy
Maybe they shoulda called that show Little Kosher House on the Prairie?
We've got Jerry Lewis, Ben Stiller and Jack Black
Tom Arnold converted to Judaism but you guys can have him back
We may not get to kiss underneath the mistletoe
But we can do it all night long with Deuce Bigelow
I'm Jewish
Put on your yamulke, here comes Chanukah
The guy in Willie Nelson's band who plays harmoniaca
Celebrates Chanukah
Osama Bin Laden
Not a big fan of the Jews
Well maybe that 's because he lost a figure-skating match to gold medalist Sarah Hughes-Her mama's Jewish
Houdini and David Blaine escape strait jackets with such precision
But the one thing they could not get out of-their painful circumcision
Gwyneth Paltrow's half-Jewish but a full-time Oscar winner
Jennifer Connely's half Jewish, too, and I'd like to put some more in her
There's Lou Reed, Perry Farrel, Beck and Paula Abdul
Joey Ramone invented punk rock music, but first came Hebrew school
Hey, Natalie Portmanika?
It's time to celebrate Chanukah?
I hope you get an abtronika
On this joyful, toyful Chanukah
So get a high colonika
And soil your long Johnikas
If you really, really wannaka?
Have a happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy,...
Happy Chanukah!<start>When I was young I used to see her
Herdin' her goats on the hillside
No one knows
And she ain't tellin' her age
I'd say she's just about seventy-five
She's an old timer tryin'
To hold on to what she's got
They call her Goat Annie
I still remember the stories
The townspeople told to each other
Just because she liked her goats
Better than people
They said the devil was her brother
She never paid them no mind
She just kept on
Bein' herself Goat Annie
She's a rare individual
One of a dying breed
Everything she's got
Right now
Is all she'll ever need
One day the government decided
They had to have
The land she lived on
They came with the papers
Polite as could be
They said she had just thirty days
To get gone
You could see them smirking
We're just doin' our job here
You understand, Goat Annie
She said, I was born and raised here
Ain't never done wrong to no one
You ain't gonna
Throw me off my land, not
Me or my goats or my shotgun
Then she leveled her 12-gauge
With a blast, she sent 'em packin'
Go, Goat Annie
Next day they came with the lawmen
But that didn't get 'em nowhere
Rather than shoot
At a poor old lady
They decided to let her
Live her days out there
It doesn't happen very often
But there are still some people
With heart
Like Goat Annie<start>You told me that the world is full of sinners
And placed a bible at my feet
I could hardly understand you
I had just learned to chew my meat
I heard that you were calling on The Lord
Asking for answers, for some relief
Heard that you were calling out my name, my name
And you cried for a whole week
Said "have you seen my son, he's lost in the world somewhere
I pray for him every day but I know he ain't seeing Your ways
Is he all right now, is he all right?
As I got older it never got any better
Said I'm trying to find some truth in this world
I know there's things that you won't understand
I heard that you were calling on The Lord
Asking for answers, for some relief
Heard that you were calling out my name, my name
And you cried for a whole week
Said "have you seen my son, he's lost in the world somewhere.
I pray for him every day but I know he ain't seeing Your ways
All right
All right
We fought all the way from Florida
Now locked into New Orleans
I said God must love every one
Even the ones that just loves the least
They say that when a mother loves a child
Oh she would do most anything
I know that I can never make it right
But it's hard to hear you say it
Said "have you seen my son, he's lost in the world somewhere.
I pray for him every day but I know he ain't seeing Your ways
Is he all right now?
Is he all right?<start>Like Elvis, like everyone
We all die, we all live on in photos
And paper blacks, if we're lucky
We're coming back
Mother Mary over, over
Mother Mary over
Over me
We notice
We understand
We throw out all we can
We're on the market, we're up on racks
If we're really lucky we're coming back
I would never decide
Mother Mary over, over
Mother Mary over
Over me<start>Did you see the first man on the moon?
Have you seen the first light of day?
When there wasn't someone stuck inside
Something like the moon
Something like a star that's lost its way
Did you go to Dallas on that day?
Have you been to where they broke a dream?
Where there really isn't room for doubt
Somehow we got lost
And the truth is buried somewhere in-between
And everyone, everywhere
Take time and dry your eyes
Cause too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried
Just look into that beautiful blue
That beautiful blue, blue sky
And know too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried
The mystery of why they had to leave
I'm only one of thousands saying why
Why a balcony in Memphis Tennessee
Seems trapped in time
Just an angry finger pointing at the sky
Would you wait to stand inside his shoes?
And is the best all you have to give
The barefoot man lived a simple life
I guess he knew
Something's die so other things might live
So everyone, everywhere
Take time and dry your eyes
Cause too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried
Just look into that beautiful blue
That beautiful blue, blue sky
And know too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried
Oh come on everyone, everywhere
Take time and dry your eyes
Cause too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried
Just look into that beautiful blue
That beautiful blue, blue sky
And know too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried.<start>Well, my mom and papa told me they had some words to say
They said, "Get out", I said, "I'm leaving anyway"
I made some money playing this here guitar
Filled in a form and went and bought myself a car
I've got my cheque book, baby
Got my bags all packed
If you're comin' with me, get in the motor
Throw your suitcase in the back
Well, I've been here for so long, sick of this whole town
Ain't getting younger and it's time I got around
Gotta go some places, I ain't never been before
When I turn that corner, mama, you won't see me no more
I've got my cheque book, baby
Got my bags all packed
If you're comin' with me, get in the motor
Throw your suitcase in the back
Well, I've been here for so long, sick of this whole town
Ain't getting younger and it's time I got around
I gotta go some places, I ain't never been before
When I turn that corner, mama, you won't see me no more
I've got my cheque book, baby
I got my bags all packed
If you're comin' with me, get in the motor
Throw your suitcase in the back<start>It might do you harm
Hanging around this farm
We got things that infect
Things we can't shake and a rep
Oh it might seem mean
All your starry eyed dreams
Will come true but my friend
Somethings haunting them
And so what we made
Was mediocre and brave
We tried hard but see
Isolation breeds that beast
Out on the farm on my worst days
I just hang my hat and I watch them graze
All happy and dumb of what's to come
But I get so bored out on this killing floor
Should we ford the stream
To the other dream
Break the bank see what we're worth
Communicate?
Or start all over again
Make this farm our friend?
Put the broken beasts our of their misery
Knowing what we know
Instead of what we hate
Do we hang our hats
And just let it be?<start>Wisps of smoke
Scented foams
Dress the ceiling with drips of shades
As the great moth spins carmine veils
Bees and dragonflies
Fireflies as bedside lights
Sigh in sails until welkin thrills
As winged arms turn the Catherine wheel
Cyanide lips
Hemlock sleep
Dreams in formaldehyde
Slowly mourn, sink and die
Give me blooms and gardens
That would awake me
Blow on me dandelions
As daffodils scream
But no radiant eastern glare<start>I have overloved you and overseen you
And now you're refusing the gifts that I bring you
My hands have been clasping my hot head and asking
"if she submits to me, will she be my property? "
You may be bleeding but you're not dying
Though you are dying to go
Stop teasing me
I'm not seeing you leaving me
Here is a party full of my friends
And here is a cup being filled up to be drunk again
We are just starting luxurious lives
To be drunkards and diddymen
Making gulf wars and battered wives.
Now I may be pleading
But there's no love nor fear in my eyes
Just greediness
I'm not seeing this sleeping dog lie.
I am the wild horses who will drag you away
I am the locked door who can make you stay
And I will act the man in almost anyway I can
So I can keep keep keep you.
So wake up you pretty thing to a wonderful home
Where we while away the happy saturdays
Between the television and the telephone
And I stroke your head just to feel what I own
Whispering
"will you be my property, and not my disability? "
And why are you craving
To be free from love's slavery
Stop teasing me
Love's not letting go.
I am the child calling you to come back and play
I am the concert hall in which you hear me say
I'll act a man in almost anyway I can
So I can keep keep keep you even though you may not understand
I am the bee and you are the pollen
I am the keeper you are the lion
I am the holes down which you would have fallen
If I had not been the hand who came and beckoned you
(and I'm not seeing this sleeping dog lie)
Maybe
You were born wrong
But why am I picking holes in you
When it's holes that we all come from?
Maybe I was born strong
To stop love from overtaking me
To stop love from living too long.
And you may be bleeding
And leading me to the blood flow
But sleep tight tonight lions
This keeper's never letting go.<start>I was born in the dirt
I never had no home
And the places I've lived
You don't want to know
But if you want to hear evil
Just come a little bit close
I was a snake-eyed boy
And at the age of five
I made love to the howl of the wolves
With a dark haired girl
So if you want to hear evil
Come a little bit close
She whispered in my ear
Little boy you the one
Set the world to rights
Make it tremble in fear
Do it one more time
'Cause you the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one
Yea, you're the one
Little boy, you're the one
Do it one more time
She said the path you walk
Gonn' be hard one to tread
'Cause the night is your only love
Lots of girls gonn' be hurt
Said it's part of your fate
'Cause you're the one, you're the one
And now I know my place
In this life I ride
And I know the things I feel
A burning deep inside
So if you want to meet evil
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
Yea, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
Do it one more time<start>I feel the pressure's on and something's going wrong
I don't know what's going on
I'm just another mother's poor boy's son
I feel pressure, pressure
These four walls are a prison to me
I feel pressure, pressure
Why's everybody always picking on me?
This is the time, is this a dream?
This is the hour, is this for real?
It's here and now
'Cause after all this is your life
I'm all messed up inside don't want this kind of life
It's not what I'd call home sweet home
All I want to be is left alone
I feel pressure, pressure
About all the things that never can be
I feel pressure, pressure
Where on earth can I be free?
This is the time, is this for me?
This is the hour, is this the one?
It's here and now
'Cause after all this is your life
I'm leaving town tonight it's got to be alright
I'm gonna make it on my own
Gonna take a ride into the great unknown
No more pressure, pressure
Something good better happen to me
Pressure, no more pressure
I tell you something good better happen for me
This is the time, this is for real
This is the hour, this one's for me
It's here and now
'Cause after all this is your life<start>I watched you fall
saw the look in your eyes
then my knees gave way,
and I heard you say.
Baby don't be scared,
I'm right here.
I'll always be right here,
By your side..
I watched you slip away..
I wanted to do the same.
Just walk away, and drop everything.
then your voice came to me.
I know I can't walk away,
can't give up. Oh baby
maybe one day, but I know
I can't walk away from
something I will always miss.<start>If you`re gonna walk on my love, baby
The least you can do is take off your shoes.
Yeah, if you`re gonna walk on my love, baby
The least you can do is take off your shoes.
Yes, how can you hurt me so bad, baby
After I`ve been so good to you.
Coming home last night about half past ten,
I saw you with another man, baby.
Coming out of the Dewdrop Inn
You know I recognized the dress
I bought you, baby
To match your red shoes.
But you said if I didn`t touch you
Hey, I could have been used.
If you`re gonna walk on my love, baby
The least you can do is take off your shoes.
I want to know how can you hurt me so bad, baby
After I`ve been so good to you.
Your love is so good, baby
You know it`s hard to complain
But I`ve been out here knocking about fifteen minutes
In this cold pouring rain,
I hear the music played inside
So you know I know you`re at home.
Who`s in there with you, baby
I believe you are doing me wrong.
If you`re gonna walk on my love, baby
The least you can do is take off your shoes
I want to know how can you hurt me so bad, baby
After I`ve been so good to you.
Please walk beside me, baby
Why do you want to treat me like a fool
Oh please, please, walk beside me, baby
Why do you treat me like a fool
If you`re just gonna walk on my love, baby
Baby, please take off your shoes
Oh, baby, baby, baby
I know you hear me calling you
Oh, I know you know your name, baby
Why do you treat me just like a fool
Yeah, if you`re just gonna
Gonna walk on my love, baby
Oh, do me a favor, please take off your shoes
Take `em all, baby
Oh, yeah<start>Slip away, your vanity is gone, I'm falling out of place
We all fall down, the pain goes on
We bear through the war and turn the lost away
We all fall down, the pain goes on
And I'll be the fire that dries the flood
As I fight for one last prayer, I keep holding on
No love to believe in
As I drag the Devil down, I will stand alone
No longer defeated
Stripped away, we rise above it all, forgotten and betrayed
We all fall down, the pain goes on
No better than before, still broken and afraid
We all fall down, the pain goes on
And I'll be the cloud that hides the sun
As I fight for one last prayer, I keep holding on
No love to believe in
As I drag the Devil down, I will stand alone
No longer defeated
I'm falling to pieces, (Pained and used)
I know what I needed, it's not you
It's not you
As I fight for one last prayer, I keep holding on
No love to believe in
As I drag the Devil down, I will stand alone
No longer defeated
No longer defeated
No longer defeated<start>1st verse
Oh say can you see
Mrs. drotzur's rolls
there as heavy as a whale
and as big as the ocean
they sag really bad
probably cause she is fat
has she ever thought
that a diet might help her
how long can she stand
she's large as the land
the great USA
can barely contain her
oh say do those jelly rolls for ev---er wa----ve
to look like she does

Dad said, son you're fucking high
And i thought, yeah there's a first for everything
So i took my old man's advice
Three sad semesters
It was only 15 grand spent in bed
I thought about the army
I dropped out and joined a band instead
Grew a moustache and a mullet
Got a job at chick-fil-a
Citing artistic differences
The band broke up in may
And in june reformed without me
And they'd got a different name
I nuked another grandma's apple pie
And hung my head in shame
Been thinking a lot today
Been thinking a lot today
Oh, i think i'll write a screenplay
Oh, i think i'll take it to la
Oh, i think i'll get it done yesterday
In this time of introspection
On the eve of my election
I say to my reflection
God please spare me more rejection
'cause my peers they criticize me
And my ex-wives all despise me
Try to put it all behind me
But my redneck past is nipping at my heels
I've been thinking a lot today
I've been thinking a lot today
I've been thinking a lot today
I thought about the army...<start>I got a big surprise when I saw you smile
I never dreamed that it could be
But now I realize since I saw you smile
There's only happiness for me
So
Bye bye blues
Bye bye blues
Bells ring
Birds sing
Sun is shining
No more pining
Just we two
Smiling thru
Don't sigh
Don't cry
Bye bye blues

And you pulled every punch that you had but there's one that you need,
Then you've waited too long,
There's a hole in your heart,
And all you've become is emotionally overrun
[Chorus]
Wishing wells were made to echo a dime,
The consequences are you keep on relying,
You've become a run and hide refugee,
Baby I'm a cop, stop, put up your hands and surrender to me
You're gonna get hooked if there's anything left I can do,
You've already disarmed it's your lasting alarm I pursue,
You can loosen those fists,
C'mon blow me a kiss,
You've been roughed up enough to deserve some relief from your troubles,
So I'm coming in
[Chorus]
Otherwise, I would never tell you what to do despite,
Any indecision though I know I'm right,
Arguing was always my forte,
And one thing I can say is I won't tell you lies,
Or treat you like a rental car like other guys,
And if you think I'm crazy find an alibi,
Cause you will need some evidence to show
[Chorus]
Baby I'm a cop, stop, put up your hands and surrender to me<start>Two men were standing, fighting, demanding.
They could not decide who was right.
Voices were changing, attacks were exchanging.
One man yelled, "You've got it backwards, it backwards!"
Two leaders of the church,
They never know they were
In love with the same thing.
The body's divided, opinions collided.
The men drew a line in the sand.
One wants tradition, the other, petition.
Both saying, "I want it my way, it my way."
Two leaders of the church,
They never know they were
In love with the same thing.
So what was the result?
In love with the same thing.
(They never spoke of you that day.
There was no love in that place.)<start>They were driving south on the highway
Their business was in another town
Bigger than the town they were driving from.
Business took place during office hours in both towns.
This drive was considered business
The feeling of passing other cars was also considered business
A feeling of business being done.
The feeling of drifting slowly through a field of moving vehicles.
This was the REAL speed - the speed of business.
Not the numbers on the speedometer.
One of them was playing with the radio
Slowly changing the channel from one station to another
Sometimes listening to both channels at once.
On one channel a man was talking to another man on the telephone.
The other channel was playing oldies

So, the ice car is gone
The muses have flown
November is dead
The numbness remains
Then April came shaking the rythm
Of a disused melody
Brightened the colours again
Of a washed-away picture
If I'd have been
Able to find just a word
Or only a magic wand
To light up your eyes by a flame
And keep it through the wind
Dreams are made to be broken
And no god could explain why
A fool always rambles in a fancy blue space
The water keeps cooling its blue
The silence takes all
June means the end
Of fading promisses
Clouds are freezing the landscape
So close to an empty pool
Sometimes happiness is just
Another bitter ice cream
I would have loved
To sing you to sleep
But the way seems too hard
And the road much too long
The poison's spreading so slowly
A secret need
To drawn in your tears
And falling insane
Your smile is dead and gone
Never thought I'd miss my time
I'm just a thursday believer
Making illusions unreal
If I could help
Closing my eyes to the tale
I wouldn't leave anymore
The magic thursday you created
You're a girl from a dream<start>There's a kid I know but not too well
He doesn't have a lot to say
Well this boy lives right next door and he
Never has nothin' to say
It doesn't seem like he does anything
He never helps out in the yard
He lets his mother carry in groceries
'Cause he doesn't plan to work too hard
The boy next door is into better things
As far as I can see
The boy next door is into bigger things
The boy next door is me, all right
Well he's not like the boys we used to have
Not like them at all, oh no
Those ones made their parents proud
This one beats 'em all<start>Some say that love is sweet as a rose,
Some say it's honey and the bee,
Well sit right down and let me tell you
What my love is to me.
"Candy"
I call my sugar "Candy"
Because I'm sweet on "Candy"
And "Candy" is sweet on me
He/She understands me,
My understanding "Candy"
And "Candy"'s always handy
When I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her
He/She has taken my complete heart,
Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart
"Candy"
Its gonna be just dandy
The day I take my "Candy"
And make him mine all mine
Mine<start>Censorship on the left and right

Enforced Orthodoxy
Enforced Orthodoxy<start>Leave the bright blue door on the whitewashed wall.
Leave the death ledger under City Hall.
Leave the joyful air in that rubber ball today.
Leave the lilac print on the linen sheet.
Leave the birds you killed at your father's feet.
Let the sideways rain and the crooked street remain.
Leave the whimpering dog in his cold kennel.
Leave the dead star lit on her pedestal.
Leave the acid kids in their green fishbowls today.
Just leave the sad guitar in its hard-shelled case.
Leave the worried look on your lover's face.
Let the orange embers in the fireplace remain.
Cause everything - it must belong somewhere.
A train off in the distance; bicycle chained to the stairs.
Everything - it must belong somewhere.
I know that now - that's why I'm staying here.
Leave the ocean's roar in the turquoise shell.
Leave the widower in his private hell.
Leave the liberty in that broken bell today.
Leave the epic poem on its yellow page.
Leave the gray macaw in his covered cage.
Let the traveling band on the interstate remain.
Cause everything - it must belong somewhere.
Soundstage in California; televisions in Times Square.
Everything - it must belong somewhere.
I know that now - that's why I'm staying here.
Leave the secret talks on the trundle bed.
Leave the garden tools in the rusted shed.
Leave those bad ideas in your troubled head today.
Leave the restless ghost in his old hotel.
Leave the homeless man in his cardboard cell.
Let the painted horse on the carousel remain.
Cause everything - it must belong somewhere.
Just like the gold around her finger or the silver in his hair.
Everything - it must belong somewhere.
I know that now - that's why I'm staying here.
In truth, the forest hears each sound - each blade of grass as it lies down.
The world requires no audience - no witnesses...no witnesses.
Leave the old town drunk on his wooden stool.
Leave the autumn leaves in the swimming pool.
Leave the poor black child in his crumbling school today.
Leave the novelist in his daydream tune.
Leave the scientist in his Rubik's Cube.
Let the true genius in the padded room remain.
Leave the horse's hair on the slanted bow.
Leave the slot machines on the river boat.
Leave the cauliflower in the casserole today.
Leave the hot, bright trash in the shopping malls.
Leave the hawks of war in their capitol.
Let the organ's moan in the cathedral remain.
Cause everything - it must belong somewhere.
They locked the devil in the basement; threw God up into the air.
Everything - it must belong somewhere.
And you know it's true - I wish you'd leave me here.
You know it's true - why don't you leave me here?<start>This is not another song about the reasons I am stressed
This is not melody to get the feelings off my chest
This is not a pop song written for the radio
These are just my thoughts and what I'm praying for
Chorus:
If this is my story, If this is my song
I wanna be a part of something beautiful
If this is my journey, Show me your road
Where ever you lead me in this world I wanna go
There's just too many times I only think of me
'Cause I get so consumed with my opportunities
But when my life's work brings me to the feet of God
I wanna hear him say I lived for his glory
Chorus:
If this is my story, If this is my song
I wanna be a part of something beautiful
If this is my journey, Show me your road
Where ever you lead me in this world I wanna go
Colors paint the evening sky
The sun is shining giving light
Stars light up the atmosphere
But we're the reason God came here
We are his story, we are his song
A beautiful melody that shows the world his love
When we're on this journey, when we're on this road
We are a part of the greatest story ever told<start>I know how I want to live: Positive! (x4)

Can't you see, I'm no good without you?
Take my lips, I wanna lose them
Take my arms, I never use them

How can I get along without you?
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?
Your goodbyes left me with eyes that cry
How can I get along without you?

I slip on the shirt and grab my shoes
I head to work to pay my dues
Just another week of the same old stuff
Work my fingers all the way to the bone
I'm polite to customers on the phone
My body's working but my mind is gone
I just can't wait to get home
And shut the door grab a praise cd and turn it up
Take the phone off the hook and turn the light off
Lay down lay my head back and clear my thoughts
Hey God it's me
I've been waiting for this time all day long
So that we could be all alone
To worship You with my heart, my soul, and my mind
And leave it all behind
Separate all my laundry clothes
Repaired the hole in the vacuum hose
Wiped the grime off the toilet bowl
Gotta do the dishes before I mow
Then do three sets of eight on chest
Cause I gotta keep my shape in check
Everything else I do will have to wait
Cause I got a very important date
Shut the door grab a praise cd and turn it up
Take the phone off the hook and turn the light off
Lay down lay my head back and clear my thoughts
Hey God it's me
I've been waiting for this time all day long
So that we could be all alone
To worship You with my heart, my soul, and my mind
And leave it all behind

You can read it in our hands
Forgive me father for the change we bring
But it's all for the man who would be king
Don't leave a body standing
Not the holy not the small
Deliver us from evil
If it's yours we want it all
Lately father I've been wondering
Is the devil just the man who would be king
How can right be ever wrong
We are glory we are stronger than you
We never got an answer
But it's just too late to ask
The bloody flag was waving
And our hearts just ran too fast
Curse me father for the chains we bring
And don't believe the man who would be king
We never got an answer
Cause the question slipped my mind
I've been so busy killing
That I haven't found the right time<start>I.
What will it be like
To get to know you from another side
Will it still be you

You'd be the life of the party

See'mon baby I wish we could destroy this world
Outside this bar
Together you and me turn this quiet night into silence
Together we'll turn this love into violence<start>She had the word
Had the way
The way of letting me know
She knew the game
Called the play
Oh she hit me low
She said, "Now you go your way
I'll go mine
And that's a start"
Doctor, doctor
Ain't no cure
For the pain in my heart
[Chorus]
Gimme a bullet to bite on
Something to chew
Gimme a bullet to bite on
And I'll make believe
I'll make believe it's you
Don't need no drink
Don't need no drug
Don't need no sympathy
Sooner or later
Send me a bill
For what she's doing to me
Operator
Long distance lips
On the telephone
Come tomorrow
Come to grips
With me all alone
[Chorus]<start>I still hang around
Neither lost nor found
Hear the lonely sound
Of music in the night
Nights are always bright
That's all that's left for me, yeah
I play the street life because there's no place I can go
Street life, it's the only life I know
Street life and there's a thousand cards to play
Street life, until you play your life away
You let the people see
Just who you wanna be
And every night you sang
Just like a superstar
The type of life that's played
A temptin' masquerade
You dress and walk and talk
You're who you think you are
Street life, you can run away from time
Street life, for a nickel, for a dime
Street life, but you better not get old
Street life, or you're gonna feel the cold
There's always love for sale
A grown up fairy tale
Prince charming always smiles
Behind a silver spoon
And if you keep it young
Your song is always sung
Your love will pay your way
Beneath the silver moon
Street life
Street life
Street life
Oh, street life
I play the street life because there's no place I can go
Street life, it's the only life I know
Street life and there's a thousand cards to play
Street life, until you play your life away
You let the people see
Just who you wanna be
And every night you sang
Just like a superstar
The type of life that's played
A temptin' masquerade
You dress and walk and talk
You're who you think you are
Street life, you can run away from time
Street life, for a nickel, for a dime
Street life, but you better not get old
Street life, or you're gonna feel the cold
There's always love for sale
A grown up fairy tale
Prince charming always smiles
Behind a silver spoon
And if you keep it young
Your song is always sung
Your love will pay your way
Beneath the silver moon
Street life
Street life
Street life
Oh, street life
Oh, street life
Yeah, street life
Street life
Oh, street life<start>I'm not impressed,
I guess I'm not impressed.
With which dialect, which dialect marches best,
And who reaches heaven in what order
When our kids are baptized in mortar.
It's a shame that our messiahs move their pawns from different mountains
And we're left to move their bodies 'round the fountain.
If a leader preaches worship to the sheep within the valley,
Who'll be riding in a tank that says "just married"?
We found that ultimately you can make it snow in the summer.
Contrary to what you believe
We oscillate and vary speed.
The food in jail is sulphury.
How do Inuits spell relief?<start>falling down into the secrets
the secrets in my mind
leaving all my life behind me
absolution hard to find
memorys dawn in pale forgiveness
i know i was unkind
can you please forgive me
never enough, i fall apart
sawing feelings in my own cage
my soul is crying loud
longing for some rest in my brain
no more turning inside out
memorys dawn in pale forgiveness
my time to feel is gone
can you please forget me
never again, i`m lost on
heaven`s ground - lost between those feelings i have never found
sometimes i look in the mirror
the mirror of myself
is it just a waste? or something
something i should build
memorys dawn in pale forgiveness
my time to feel is gone
can you please forget me
never again, i`m lost on
heaven`s ground - lost between those feelings have never found
i am lost in myself - on heaven`s ground
i am lost in myself - my soul cry`s loud
heaven`s ground - lost between those feelings i have never found<start>And I know we were both too young way back when we had our thing
And you're not the one that I think every time that the telephone rings
And I know that what we had would not be called love by the ones who know
And I know it's been many years and hundred love affairs a go
I know all that so well but I also do know this
Calleth you cometh I
And that's just how it is
And how it is always been
It's were my reason stops
And something else comes in
I know it doesn't make sense
But still
Calleth you cometh I
And that's how it is!!!
And I know we became restrained every time we were among friends
And I know how it was last time and how bitterly it always ends
And I know we were both too young to know what real love would be like
And I know our communication didn't always work out right.
I know all that so well but I also do know this
Calleth you cometh I
And that's just how it is
And how it's always been
It's were my reason stops
And something else came in
I know it doesn't make sense
But still
Calleth you cometh I
And I've been waiting for this so long,waiting to sing this song
For, you<start>Driving home she grabs something to eat
Turns a corner and drives down her street
Into a row of houses she just melts away
Like the scenery in another man's play
Into a house where the blinds are closed
To keep from seeing things she don't want to know
She pulls the blinds and looks out on the street
The cool of the night takes the edge off the heat
In the Jackson Cage
Down in the Jackson Cage
You can try with all your might
But you're reminded every night
That you been judged and handed life
Down in the Jackson Cage
Every day ends in wasted motion
Just crossed swords on the killing floor
To settle back is to settle without knowing
The hard edge that you're settling for
Because there's always just one more day
And it's always gonna be that way
Little girl you've been down here so long
I can tell by the way that you move you belong to
The Jackson Cage
Down in Jackson Cage
And it don't matter just what you say
Are you tough enough to play the game they play
Or will you just do your time and fade away
Down into the Jackson Cage, let's go
Baby there's nights when I dream of a better world
But I wake up so downhearted girl
I see you feeling so tired and confused
I wonder what it's worth to me or you
Just waiting to see some sun
Never knowing if that day will ever come
Left alone standing out on the street
'Til you become the hand that turns the key down in
Jackson Cage
Down in Jackson Cage
Well darlin' can you understand
The way that they will turn a man
Into a stranger to waste away
Down in the Jackson Cage<start>Do you hear the thunder
Raging in the sky?
Premonition of a
Shattered world that's gonna die
In the Age of Reason
how do we survive?
The protocols of evil
Ravaging so many lives?
So many lives
So many lives
Mystifying silence
Talking Peace on Earth
We should judge each other
For ourselves not what we're worth
Sustainable extinction
A fractured human race
A jaded revolution
Disappears without a trace
without a trace
without a trace
Alrigth yeah
Always felt that there'd be trouble
Mass distraction hides the truth
Prozac days and sleepless hours
Seeds of change that don't bear fruit
oh yeah,
these time are heavy
And you're all alone
The battle's over
But the war goes on
Politics, religion
Love of money too
It's what the world was built for
But not for me and you, oh yeah<start>"Not just any insane asylum," she exclaimed indignantly, as though I had offended her. "Though you certainly do not deserve it, you are a very lucky girl indeed, for you have been assigned a bed in the most progressively innovative, the most morally experimental, the most, ah, the most ingeniously directed medical institution for the mentally ill, lead by my own dear son, Dr. Montmorency Stockhill. You, unworthy child, are now an inmate of The Asylum For Wayward Victorian-"
What have I got
That makes you want to love me?
Is it my body?
Someone I might be?
Something inside me?
You'd better tell me
Tell me
It's really up to you
Have you got the time to find out
Who I really am?
What does it take
To get inside of your mind?
Give me a break
And take a chance
For the very first time
You'd better tell me
Tell me
It's really up to you
Have you got the time to find out

But just give it time
If it don't hurt now then just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feeding on
So what are you gonna do when the world don't orbit around you?
So what are you gonna do when the world don't orbit around you?
Ain't it fun living in the real world
Ain't it good being all alone
Where you're from
You might be the one who's running things
Well, you can ring anybody's bell to get what you want
You see, it's easy to ignore a trouble
When you're living in a bubble
So what are you gonna do when the world don't orbit around you?
So what are you gonna do when nobody wants to fool with you?
Ain't it fun living in the real world
Ain't it good being all alone
Ain't it good to be on your own
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one
Ain't it good to be on your own
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one
Ain't it fun living in the real world

Ain't it fun living in the real world
Ain't it good, ain't it good being all alone
Ain't it fun living in the real world
('Cause the world don't orbit around you)
Ain't it good, ain't it good being all alone (oh)

Breathe the Iberian atmosphere
Just because we are Hispanic
Doesn't mean we're oceanic
Quite frankly we've had water up to here
We've made waves to last a lifetime
We've been saturated, almost drowned
We are Spanish, not Caribbean
We are human, not amphibian
We'll seek our fortunes on Spain's solid ground
There's no future in the new world
Only fools believe the tales
Of the gold of El Dorado
Only suckers set their sails
We have seen the way the tide is turning
Cortez is a charlatan
We are on the ball, discerning
We're anti-diluvian
Two very fine examples of
Sixteenth century man
Two very modern samples of
Sixteenth, sixteenth century man
There are women who are lining
Every avenue in every port
Now at last we'll get to grips with
The things they never equip ships with
We have sailed into our last resort
There's no gold mine in the new world
It's a trick to get recruits
On the boat to El Dorado
We're returning to our roots
We're going back to land locked ladies
Cortez never letz them board
All in all the point we've made is
We don't want to go abroad
Two very fine examples of
Sixteenth century man
Two terra firma samples of
Sixteenth, sixteenth century man

Twelve before
Few others could take much more
No matter what I say
Or how I try
I can't redeem myself
Strip clean - pick up the pieces
Start over again
Who made the rules
Who decides
When I've made up
Paid up
Ten months this time
Twelve before

How can I

To correct the mistakes already made?
So hard to live up to standards
When you don't even know what they are
How can you expect me to change?<start>My mama raised me
All by herself
She didn't get
A lotta help
She made mistakes
Along the way
But here's one thing
I can truly say
My mama loved me
And she worked
And she slaved
From a little bitty baby
She made me what I am today
She didn't put up
With no back talk
I learned respect
Before I could walk
She let me run
But not all night
I'm so glad
She raised me up right
My mama love me
Ahhh...she worked and she slaved
From a little baby boy
She made me what I am today
(Guitar)
Now boys and girls
Hear what I got to say
Be good to your mama
Each and every day
Friends may come
Friends may go
But you only got one mama
And I want you to know
My mama loved me
And she worked
And slaved
From a little baby
She made me who I am today<start>You can call me dangerous, superstitious, passe', what you wish
You can take my freedom, education, pride, love & honor
'cause I'm through with the war you're fightin'
Body and soul dividin'
Arrogance of enlightenment
With no fear of God almighty
Idle minds wait for signs out of line
You can keep your solutions, propaganda, justice, paranoia
Desire unable to satisfy you
Happiness will deny
With no fear of God almighty<start>It's so mean
It's crueler than your dreams
And it's worse than it seems
Add it up
And stick it in your cup
You're sure to get enough
It runneth over now
You can't complain no more
Your bones are cracking now
You'd better knuckle down
Life's so cheap
It's cheaper than it looks
You can't learn that from books
Stay in the house
Stay clear of what you fear
And you're old beyond your years
It runneth over now
You can't complain no more
Your bones are cracking now
You'd better knuckle down
You're leaving your long shadows
Leaning into space
And your hardscrabble life
Is written all over your face
Counterfeit
The bankroll that was his
Fist of change that was yours
A life so cheap
It was cheaper than it looked
You can learn that from books
It runneth over now
You can't complain no more
Your bones are cracking now
You'd better knuckle down
They'll leave you with a prayer book
And a pocket full of grace
And your hardscrabbled life
Is written all over your face<start>She was my surfer girl,
W surfed in the sun.
Where are you surfer girl
Now our fun is done?
Angry sea, took my love from me.
No surfing today )no surfing)
Way out beyond the reef
They said don't go.
The under tide's so deep,
Drag you down below.
Drag you down below.
Angry sea, took my love from me.
No surfing today (no surfing_
Just yesterday
We felt the ocean's spray
While we were surfing side by side.
I'll never see her again
She's too far away.
I'll never ride the stand
What else can I say?
What else can I say?
Angry sea, took my love from.
No surfing today (no surfing)
No surfing today (no surfing).<start>Feeling free to see with other eyes
Now i'm looking for a clearer mirror
Really real that goes behind the eyes
Can i hold a vision now
Moonrabbit, i'm not crazy
Moonrabbit, you're the one that's crazy
Lay us down, burn the candles out
You let beauty be an answer now
I thought i saw, but see, i only thought
Can i hold a vision now
Moonrabbit, i'm not crazy
Moonrabbit, you're the one that's crazy
I'm not drifting by the dayslight with celebration
You should follow me till the midnight angel
You're inside of me
I'm inside of you

Everyone I see is missing something
Everyone I see is missing something
This dark and secret crime
Cruelty masked as something kind
Sharp against the tenderness
Cold against the emptiness
Everyone I see is missing something
Everyone I see is missing something
Split open to the wound
Send another saviour soon
Eyes closed, torn apart
Body separate from the heart
You wouldn't notice I have no skin
You wouldn't notice I have no skin
Held down on the bed
This is what I think he said
The face of Jesus hung above
I will teach you how to love
You wouldn't notice I have no skin
You wouldn't notice I have no skin
And I can find you anywhere
Even if you run from there
Eyes closed, torn apart
Body separate from the heart
Everyone I see is missing something
Everyone I see is missing something
Balance reaches beyond itself to lay hold of intelligence
So that it's satisfactions brought to the surface of consciousness
May become profounder more intense and more compelling
Violent, we take a step away from awareness
And by striving to grasp the significance of our own violent impulses
We move further away from the frenzied raptures violence instigates
Everyone I see is missing something
Everyone I see is missing something
Burned with a cigarette
Some things you don't forget
Well trained in going numb
Well prepared for what's to come
You wouldn't notice I have no skin
You wouldn't notice I have no skin
No thought, no breath, no eyes, no heart
In order to reach the limits of the ecstasy in which we lose ourselves in bliss
You must set an immediate boundary
Pain can carry me nearer to the moment
Bring me to a state of bliss bordering on delerium
No thought, no breath, no eyes, no heart
And I can find you anywhere
Even if you run from there
Eyes closed, torn apart
Body separate from the heart
You wouldn't notice I have no skin
You wouldn't notice I have no skin<start>Have you got a fine place to slip to
When you're feeling down
Have you had a week or two
Just to get your troubles down
Found a lot of life and laughter
With a grandfather in the bowery
She had a body of sixteen or seventeen
She had a mind of forty
I met her on a cold day
In a city far away
With the worlds about zero
And i saw at once,
Into her soul
She's gonna call me her hero
Never like a walk in the rain or the lane
I found a lot of death that day
With the grandfather in the bowery
'Cause i like her like the world<start>Your old man got mad when I told him we were leaving
He cursed and he raged and he swore at the ceiling
He called you his child, said honey get wise to his game
He'll get you in trouble I know it, those bums are all the same
There's a Greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us
So tell him goodbye, we gotta go west on that bus
And it's all over now
Don't you worry no more
Gonna go west to the sea
The Greyhound is swaying
And the radio is playing
Some blues for baby and me
And the highway looks like it never did
Lord it looks so sweet and so free
And I can't forget that trip to the west
Singing blues for baby and me
Saw your hands trembling, your eyes opened in surprise
It's ninety in the shade babe, and there ain't a cloud in the sky
I called you my child, said honey now this is our game
There's two of us to play it and I'm happy to be home again
There's a Greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us
So tell him goodbye, we gotta go west on that bus
And it's all over now
Don't you worry no more
We're gonna go west to the sea
The Greyhound is swaying
And the radio's playing
Some blues for baby and me
And the highway looks like it never did
Lord it looks so sweet and so free
And I can't forget that trip to the west
Singing blues for baby and me
And it's all over now
Don't you worry no more
We're gonna go west to the sea

Do you love me
Watch me scream
Burning on the trees
In amazement
'Cause I'm on fire
Ya know?
Four five six
Show you all my tricks
Fee Fi Fo
A giant's at the door
In amazement
'Cause I'm on fire
Oh
Oh
'Cause I'm on fire
Can I get an amen
For all the bleeding and the prayin?
I had to struggle to be gracious
Now we can touch it
We can taste it
Can I get a little amen?
No more running from the hangman
Now I'm the pilot of this spaceship
So you can touch it
You can taste it
Taste the smoke
Taste the smoke
Taste the smoke
This is no joke
Fifteen years
Blood, sweat, and tears
And amazement
'Cause I'm on fire
It's a cruel, cruel world
For good boys and girls
A hot day in heaven,
Five six and seven
And amazement
'Cause I'm on fire
With no hope from the devil
Can I get an amen
For all the bleeding and the prayin'?
I had to struggle to be gracious
Now we can touch it
We can taste it
Can I get a little amen?
No more running from the hangman
Now I'm the pilot of this spaceship
So you can touch it
You can taste it
It'll be OK, baby
Oo, ha
Oo, ha
Oo, ha
Oo, ha
We don't run, run, run
We don't run, run, run
Can I get an amen
For all the bleeding and the prayin'?
I had to struggle to be gracious
Now we can touch it
We can taste it
Can I get a little amen?
No more running from the hangman
Now I'm the pilot of this spaceship
So you can touch it
You can taste it
We don't run, run, run
We don't run, run, run<start>As i watched it all begin...
I was there.
I'm caught
In the
Middle
Of my own reality.
Where nothing's for and nothing's against,
Why don't you wake-up and you'll see the lies and the pain and the oppression.
I could never understand,
All that is good,
And all that's supposed to be.
And I, I could not escape the lies.
My reality.
I'm caught
In the
Middle
Of my own reality.
I could never understand,
All that is good,
And all that's supposed to be.
And I, I could not not escape the lies.
My reality.
Oh my God oh my God,
I held myself down.
I was trapped in my own mind.
I'm caught
In the
Middle
Of my own reality.<start>Remember the feelings,
Remember the day..
My stone heart was breaking,
My Love Ran Away.
This Moment I knew i would be someone else.
My love turned around and i fell...

But Dont Be My Friend.
You Can Be My Bad Boy... But Understand.
That I Dont Need You In My Life Again.

But Dont Be My Friend.
You Can Be My Bad Boy....But Understand.

You Once Made This Promise,
To Stay By My Side.
But After Some Time,
You Just Pushed Me Aside.
You Never Thought That,
A Girl Could Be Strong
Now I Will Show You How To Go On....
Be My Bad Boy,

No I Dont Need You Again.<start>Instrumental<start>we made our plans to meet tonight under street lights of suburban U.S.A. nostalgia that I keep on playing on the mix will play that life made for you and it's telling me that we've all found something true embedded in nights like tonight and we move on let's wish on stars like we used I'll tell you how much I have missed you
we're spending all our lives, like we did tonight, knowing we can work this out, there are roads and signs, that lead us home sometime, knowing we will work it, we will work it out
we can find where this belongs like summer hymns and punk rock songs we love the outcome of our lonely life cause this season holds it's heart in hand like allergies to swollen glands we know keep growing on nights like to night as we move on let's drive these roads like we used to and pretend that the pavement still knows you
we're spending all our lives, like we did tonight, knowing we can work this out, there are roads and signs, that lead us home sometime, knowing we will work it, we will work it out
this is one night, built from our lives, in this town we left to love, this is my life, this is my time, and I'll take you there, I'll take you all back home<start>You know that there`s an achin` deep inside me
Tearin` me apart each lonely day
You can sooth my spirit with some of your lovin`
With you by my side we can make it OK
There`s a way of love with you
And I`m seeing the glow
All I need is understandin` just to
Let me grow
I can`t tell you now `bout all of my reasons
Burdens of this life have me in a trance
You can help unlock my other secrets
Though your warm embrace I give the
Good life a chance
There`s a way of love with you and I`m feelin` it flow
All I need is understandin` just to let me grow
Hold me - just a little tighter
`Cause when you hold me - I don`t have to fight it
I don`t want to sound like I`m full of self pity
`Cause that`s not the way I want it to be
All I need for now is your love to forget her
Love so sweet completely settin` me free
There`s a way of love with you
And I`m seeing the glow
All I need is understandin` just to
Let me grow
Hold me - just a little tighter
When you hold me - I don`t have to fight it<start>Face the day and face the night
Hold you close and hold you tight
Did I keep you satisfied
Or did I let you down?
Bullet trains and aeroplanes
Blow in from the south
Well you're someone's baby now
Fields of green and oceans blue
Sweeter things and bitter fruits
Only make me think of you yeah
Waiting in the sky
Hurricanes and fire flames
Never brought you down
Well you're someone's baby now
When you're lookin' in the mirror
See my shadow's on the wall
Now you see things a little clearer
You're feeling two-foot tall
Heaven, hell, and in between
Yellow roses at your feet
Far from all them city streets
Shattering the night
Golden years will slip away
Buried in the ground
Come on and hold yourself up to the light
And do not make a sound
You know your mama taught you what to love
But she never taught you how
Well you're somebody's baby now
When you're lookin' in the mirror
You see my shadow's on the wall
Well, can you hear me babe?
I need you near me
I'm someone's baby now
You can't, can't let go
You know when you can't, can't let go<start>Life goes on and on
Like your favorite song
What we feel inside
On this wayward ride
If we could find a way
If you would only stay
If we could hold on to this feelin'
And this beautiful day<start>For have I
Built a castle
Upon believing
Before I doubt
I have suffered
But my friends say
I have learned from it
And for have I
Believed the snow could
Not be freezing
Upon the ground
Now my ass
Is blue and black but
I am sound
And for have I
Belonged to no one
More than fleetingly and in doubt
I have had what
Now is gone but
Still I've known them
And for have I
I have absolved my-
Self of demons
I must confess
Having known them
Growing old then
I will re-e-e-est
But where are the songs
For me to sing along
When I am hoping
Someone writes one
For me
And sings me something sweetly
For I promise to sing along
And then we'll both know nothing's wrong
Singing na na na na
For have I
Delivered comfort
To the aching
And for the tired
With these words
Of comic wisdom
I have tri-i-i-ied
So where are the songs
For me to sing along
When I am hoping
Someone writes one
For me
And sings me something sweetly
For I promise to sing along
And then we'll both know nothing's wrong
Singing naaa
Na-na-na<start>Autrefois pour faire sa cour
Ils parlaient d'amour
Pour mieux prouver leur ardeur
Ils offraient son cÅur
Maintenant c'est plus pareil
Ãa change Ã§a change
Ils vous disent, mon cher ange
Et vous glissent Ã  l'oreille
Ah, Gudule
Viens m'embrasser
Et je te donnerai
Un frigidaire
Un joli scoutaire
Un atomivÃ¨re
Et du Dunlopillo
Une cuisiniÃ¨re
Avec un four en verre
Des tas de couverts
Et des pelles Ã  gÃ¢teaux
Une tourniquette
Pour faire la vinaigrette
Un bel aÃ©rateur
Pour manger les odeurs
Des draps qui chauffent
Un pistolet Ã  gauffres
Un avion pour deux
Et nous serons heureux
Autrefois s'il arrivait
Que l'on se querelle
Votre mari s'en allait
Laissant la vaisselle
Maintenant que voulez-vous
La vie est si chÃ¨re
Il dit, rentre chez ta mÃ¨re
Et il se garde tout
Ah, Gudule
Excuse-toi
Ou je reprends tout Ã§a
Mon frigidaire
Mon armoire Ã  cuillÃ¨res
Mon Ã©vier en ferre
Et mon poÃªle Ã  mazout
Mon cire-godasses
Mon repasse-limaces
Mon tabouret Ã  glace

Il reÃ§oit la visite
D'une douce petite
Qui lui offre son cÅur
Alors il flanche
Et c'est votre revanche

Jusqu'Ã  son dernier plat

All the troubled notions scrambling my brain.
I'm tired, let me be for now.
There was a time when I was interested by you,
But it isn't now.
If only I could escape
Leave a dummy in my place,
Slip away through the walls,
Not listen at all.
I'm tired, I can't explain.
I may as well have been talking to myself
By the look on your face.
I'm high, I don't feel myself.
I think I should feel happy
But I only want to lie down.
If only I could escape
Leave a dummy in my place,
Slip away through the walls,
Not listen at all.
I'm tired, I might go away,
I'm tired, I've no more to say,
I'm tired, I'm tired.
So take me, take me away.<start>Wait dear,
The time is getting late here,
I'm all washed up and graced with faint applause,
Dressed in a cheap facade.
I'm looking for a place I'll never see again,
A night turns a day,
A street I've never walked on,
I was never here,
Just a faint reflection,
A day turns to a month,
A second of affection,
I was never here,
Just a faint reflection.
Faking,
There's nothing here worth taking,
Just my reflection fading,
On the wall,
Not the fairest one of all.
I'm looking for a place I'll never see again,

I was never here,
Just a faint reflection.<start>Ride out the storm
Take on the wave
Don't run, run, run
The wind's gonna blow and the ground's gonna shake
Then it's gone, gone, gone
If I ask you tenderly, will you follow me down to the river?
I'll let you down, I'll break your wings
If you follow me down to the river
Try not to mourn
Shake off the pain
Don't run, run, run
The world's gonna spin and the earth's gonna quake
Then it's done, done, done
If I ask you tenderly, will you follow me down to the river?
I'll let you down, I'll break your wings
If you follow me down to the river
Follow me down
Follow me down to the river
Follow me down
Follow me down to the river
Follow me down
Follow me down to the river
I've got it all, all ahead of me now
A pattern's gonna form and the wind's gonna blow me down
Ride out the storm
Take on the wave
Don't run, run, run
The wind's gonna blow and the crowd's gonna break
Then it's gone, gone, gone
If I ask you tenderly, will you follow me down to the river?
I'll let you down, I'll break your wings
If you follow me down to the river

Follow me down to the river<start>Early morning without warning
Woke me with a scare
I had that dream again
That the sun was dead
Make me warm or take me home
It's so cold in here
Can't we meet somewhere
Is it winter there?
Is it winter there?
This winter
Meet me in the summer time
We can move the air
Sweet Virginia countryside
I will meet you there
Bloody lips and cherry wine
Moonshine in your hair
Just keep staring at the sun
Pray for summer's end
Come on over brave my storm
Ocean's overhead
Come inside my friend
Getting bad out there
Every moment we have stolen
All we had to share
No one wanted this
But you know I did
You know I did
This moment
Meet me in the summer time
We can move the air
Sweet Virginia countryside
I will meet you there
Bloody lips and cherry wine
Moonshine in your hair
Just keep staring at the sun
Pray for summer's end<start>Socorro, nÃ£o estou sentindo nada.

Me empreste suas penas.

JÃ¡ nÃ£o sinto nada.
Socorro, alguÃ©m me dÃª um coraÃ§Ã£o,
Que esse jÃ¡ nÃ£o bate nem apanha.
Por favor, uma emocÃ£o pequena,
Qualquer coisa.
Qualquer coisa que se sinta,
Tem tantos sentimentos, deve ter algum que sirva.

Rebuke the structure
Kiss on the hand
Fades to God's will
I would kill to see your face
Lady in red
Watch your surroundings
I'm going out on a limb
Would kill to see your face
Three weeks of torture brought me here
Pass the moons
Reject friendly envy
More on desire than principal
Wish you here<start>I've seen him looking over his shoulder
I can see your love getting
Colder and colder
I can see the girls that he
Takes out drinking
I can see the sordid thoughts
That he's thinking
It's written on his face
It's written on his jacket
And the way that his arms are dug deep right
Down in his pockets
[Pre-Chorus]
He's fumbling around
For an excuse again
[Chorus]
Has he told you that he loves you yet
I'm just worried you'll get used again
Has he told you that he loves you yet
He's breaking your heart
He's breaking away for a brand
New start and you can't see
The velvet rut looms large
And stands tall
A pelvic strut and then watch
His eyes crawl
This is not the fairytale you asked for
One day he adores you
The next he lambastes or
Throws a little glare
It used to be a twinkle
And the sweet little nothings that he
Whispered have all but gone away
[Pre-Chorus]
He's fumbling around
For an excuse again
[Chorus]
Has he told you that he loves you yet
I'm just worried you'll get used again
Has he told you that he loves you yet
He's breaking your heart
He's breaking away for a brand
New start and you can't see
[Bridge]
Get out girl
Go get out girl
That boy he
Don't deserve you
It's going downhill
Quicker and quicker
He won't hold your hand
And he can't handle his liquor
His empty promises fall on the floor
And he's not far behind
You can't take anymore
It's written on his face
And the curl of your painted lower lip
And we think that you probably
Should just abandon ship
[Pre-Chorus]
He's fumbling around
For an excuse again
[Chorus]
Has he told you that he loves you yet
I'm just worried you'll get used again
Has he told you that he loves you yet
He's breaking your heart
He's breaking away for a brand
New start and you can't see<start>Is it distasteful to label the tasteful.
Or was I unstable, I cradled the hateful.
A ha, ahah, aha, ahah, aha, ahah, aha.
Is it unfaithful to label the faithful.
Or is it a factor to act like an actor,
To act like an actor.
There was never any doubt,
When you're in you're always out,
With the grace of an angel.

When you're in you're always out,

Still I would never have guessed that you'd wind up here
In a half-way house, on a dead-end street
In a run-down part of a one-horse town
But just do what they say, don't worry 'bout your girl
'Cause I won't run away, and I won't run around
And I won't let you down, and without a doubt
I'll be waiting, waiting
Waiting at the gate when they let you out
You set the world on fire, dancing after dark
Now you're playing solitaire in a fenced-in park
I'm not the one to judge you, so baby don't be scared
No one gets a free ride, none of us is spared
I'll be back on the ninth, I've circled the date
Three o'clock sharp, and I won't be late
You've been through hell I know what that's all about
And I'll be waiting, waiting
Waiting at the gate when they let you out
The doctors have so little faith
They say you were a classic case
They said the chance is eight in ten
They'd see you back in here again
But I'm counting on you to prove the doctors wrong
I'm imagining you, healthy and strong
Your papers all stamped, your eyes so bright and blue
Looking like a baby picture of you
Walking down the path, your suitcase in your hand
The howling at your back, a brand new man
Be a perfect little camper, be a brave little scout
And I'll be waiting waiting
Waiting at the gate when they let you out...<start>What ya gonna to say about me
I ain't already thought?
What ya gonna try and sell me
I ain't already bought?
You wrap yourself in my colors
Ain't I the one you love to hate
You reel me in and run me over
I bend but I don't break
I'm my father's son, I'm a son of a gun
I won't back down
Standing, I'm still standing
I've got my feet on the ground
Standing, I'm still standing
Now I ain't giving in so figure it out
I'm wild and I'm free
I'm stubborn and proud
I'm raising these hands
Gonna shout it out loud
Standing, I'm still standing
You know me, my hands are dirty
Gonna pound my chest
Just as soon kill as kiss me
Do your worst, bring out my best
Don't play for no one
Don't give an inch
Push when the wind is blowing
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I'm a son of a bitch I don't take no shit
I won't back down
Standing, I'm still standing
I've got my feet on the ground
Standing, I'm still standing
Now I ain't giving in so figure it out
I'm wild and I'm free
I'm stubborn and proud
I'm raising these hands
Gonna shout it out loud
Standing, I'm still ...

Standing, I'm still standing

Gonna shout it out loud
Standing, I'm still standing
So come on, push me around
Standing I'm still standing
Take a look at me now
Standing, I'm still standing
I won't back down
Standing, I'm still standing
I've got my feet on the ground
Standing, I'm still standing<start>Up through the branches
The stars shine above on the arroyos and mesas you loved
And as the moon rises, the black mountain mourns
For the old friend he'll look on no more
Jacks-in-the-Pulpit, bones in the sky
Long winding rivers that never ran dry
And the secrets she gathered from the wild blowing sands
Breathed in her heart and her hands
I sing to your spirit where all my dreams dwell
The vision--the freedom, the life lived so well
And I sing in your canyons and the echoes ring clear
And I wish somehow you may still hear<start>It's a fine time to be askin' for charity
We've got babies cryin'
The well's run dry
Hardly make enough to make ends meet or keep on the heat
And you want me to talk about it
Like it's up to me to choose
Whether my voice counts I doubt it
You won't see my face on the evening news
Sky is fallin'

Ohh

Round the corner from the condo town
Living' next to five types of violence
It's enough just to bring you down, gonna mess you 'round

To pull the rich man's plow
Yeah, that's the way it's always been
Why should anybody wanna change it now

Wooh

And you don't know why or when it's gonna be

(Ohh)
Do you pull up stakes and leave or wait and see
If it's a false alarm?
There's an outside chance
Ohh, we could win it in overtime
But the clock is running, night is comin'
If you're gonna save yourself, better get off the dime
Sky is fallin'

To rise above the gutter
And say to you and man kind and the hole fucking human race
Fuck you

To all the outcasts, white trash and wasted youth out there

But dies for the peace
In the clouds, he waits for an answer
But there's no release
It's strange here without you
And it's so hard to see
So brother up in heaven
Please wait up for me
Oh, brother up in heaven
Please wait up for me
I still see his shadow
His laugh lingers on
When I dream, we're all back together
When I wake, he's gone
It's strange here without you
This was not meant to be
So brother up in heaven
Please wait up for me
And though we try to change the world
A flower when it's cut will surely die
So why do men with so much hate
Destroy what they cannot create
While we all stand by
We look back in anger
But you helped us to see
So brother up in heaven
Please wait up for me
Oh, brother up in heaven
Please wait up for me<start>I can feel the way you are and I want more
Like a warm summer rain or the quiet after a storm
Rain down on me Your glory, Lord
Let my heart know the wonders of Your ways
?Cause I remember being lost and alone
But before you now, I find myself with hope
Hope to dream of endless fields
And waves of green and be taken away
I'm taken away with You
As I look up at the sky on this glorious night
I can sense You here with me
Oh, I couldn't count the times I've allowed this sky
To remind me that You are glorious
God, You are glorious
It seems every single day I'm amazed
At the way this world reveals Your love
I couldn't ever find the words
To explain the ways in which You are glorious
God, You are glorious
And daily I will let my life be a tribute
To the ways in which You are glorious
I wanna live in You
I wanna breathe in You
I wanna be all the things You've called me to
I wanna stay in You
Put my faith in You
I wanna let my life reside in You
Let glory rain down on me
Let glory rain down on me
Let glory rain down on me
Let glory rain down on me
As I look up at the sky on this glorious night
I can sense You here with me
Oh, I couldn't count the times I've allowed this sky
To remind me that You are glorious
God, you are glorious
And daily I will let my life be a tribute
To the ways in which You are glorious
Glorious
God, God, You are glorious
Daily I will let my life be a tribute
To the ways in which You are glorious<start>,

Nice and pleasin', oh, it's really wonderful
Movin' gently, hey, it's so good to me, yes, it is
Move in simply and then let it build up gradually, baby
Takin' time with love just makes it better
So let's relax and reach our ecstasy together
But let's do it slow and easy, baby
Keep it like that, baby, that's how I like my love
I like it slow and pleasin', oh, it's really, really, really good to me
Hurried love is like a good meal down the way
It's up and gone before you really get to taste
Let's do it slow and easy babe, that's how I like my love
Slow and easy, now
No need to rush our love 'coz it ain't goin' nowhere
So let's enjoy this time, the time we both have to share
We've got to take it slow and easy, baby, that's how I like my love
I like it when you're movin' simply, oh, that's how I like my love
I like it slow and easy, baby, take your time, baby
Slow and easy now, no need to rush, baby
I like it slow, slow and easy, I said I like it slow and easy, baby
Take your time, baby, there's no need to rush, baby<start>I don't need a reason baby
I don't have to worry
I keep a tight grip on myself
I ain't in no kind of hurry
You don't get it, no
You don't get it, no
You don't get it, no
You don't get it, no
So tired of fooling around
In just a one way conversation
What the stitch's
I scratch what itches
Bravo self-gratification
Nobody does me like I do
I'm just a one man operation
Beg me to show you the ropes
Well I can't get no vacuumication
You don't get it, no
You don't get it, no
You don't get to love me!
You don't get it, no
You don't get it, no
You don't get it, no
You don't get it, no
You don't get it
You don't get it
No one gets to love me!
You don't get it, no
'Cause I'll get it on
No one's gonna hold my hand
It's got a full-time occupation
I close my eyes and picture you
And cut out all the aggrivation
You don't get it, no
You don't get it, no
You don't get it, no
You don't get it, no
You don't get it
You don't get it
No one gets to love me!
You don't get it, no
'Cause I'll get home<start>So you know it all so you know whats best. So you think that this whole world revolves at your request. Strange as it may sound but i have different dreams. I guess expecting you to care was foolish of me. Doubts still haunt my soul. Nothing's a sure bet. I've still got so far to go before my goals are met. Through my 20 years I've learned just who i want to be. My dreams of rocking out all day are all that i can see. How can you say I won't make it. What about me it seems so worthless. Don't try and stay now that it's a cool trip. You had left me before I seemed worth it.
Thanks to Danny (Rockstar866@hotmail.com) for these lyrics<start>Duerme la ciudad y en un local oscuro junto al mar
est tocando un msico de jazz.
Miras hacia m y en tus ojos cansados puedo ver
que hay un nombre escrito de mujer.
De su guitarra se van notas de fuego;
los acordes de cristal, hacia la eternidad.
Viejas canciones de amor, viejos poemas.
Entre el humo y el alcohol, la noche suena a jazz.
Duerme la ciudad y una muchacha negra entra en el bar.
Parece borracha -a ver quin no lo est-.
Grita que los blancos huelen mal.
Aos luz de soledad. Recurdame cuando me vaya.
Besa el mar la arena gris y en la ciudad la noche canta.
Son cuatro das. La noche canta.
Sentado en un rincn mirando a dos gatos retozar.
Triste estampa ser rey de la creacin,
mientras toca un msico de jazz.
De su guitarra se van notas de fuego;
los acordes de cristal, hacia la eternidad.
Viejas canciones de amor, viejos poemas.
Entre el humo y el alcohol, la noche suena a jazz.
Aos luz de soledad. Recurdame cuando me vaya.
Besa el mar la arena gris y en la ciudad la noche canta.
Son cuatro das. La noche canta...<start>The daylight fades away
It's hard to recognize your face
It scares me that I can't let go anymore
There's no floor below me to keep me on my feet
Today's the day that we fall
No reason to stay here at all
Cause the truth is the better way
Although lies are still here to stay
Though seasons pass the reasons never last
Forever's gone
I turn to come you turn to go
You don't even wanna know why I'm here
I jump to catch a shooting star
I'd give it to you if I knew where you are
Today's the day that we fall
No reason to stay here at all
Cause the truth is the better way
Although lies are still here to stay
Though seasons pass the reasons never last
Forever's gone<start>On a hot city day
When your white shirt turns to grey
That's when she'll arrive
When you look how you feel
Someone steps upon your heel
That's when she will come
Listen now
I'm not saying that there will be violins
But don't be surprised if they appear
Playing in some doorway
Still I can't believe that this is happening
We're such unlikely lovers
Though no one seems to notice as they hurry by
Ask me what I'm thinking, and I won't deny it
Can you believe it's happening?
Can you believe it's happening?
There were no magic spells
You can keep the flowers and bells
They just don't seem right
Can it actually be?
Me and you and you and me
Though we're like day and night
Listen now
I'm not saying that there will be violins
But don't be surprised if they appear
Playing in some doorway
Still I can't believe that this is happening<start>One by one, the guests arrive
The guests are coming through
The open-hearted many
The broken-hearted few
And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows why the wine is flowing
Oh love I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you
Oh . . . I need you now
And those who dance, begin to dance
Those who weep begin
And "Welcome, welcome" cries a voice
"Let all my guests come in."
And no one knows where the night is going ...
And all go stumbling through that house
in lonely secrecy
Saying "Do reveal yourself"
or "Why has thou forsaken me?"
And no one knows where the night is going ...
All at once the torches flare
The inner door flies open
One by one they enter there
In every style of passion
And no one knows where the night is going ...
And here they take their sweet repast
While house and grounds dissolve
And one by one the guests are cast
Beyond the garden wall
And no one knows where the night is going ...
Those who dance, begin to dance
Those who weep begin
Those who earnestly are lost
Are lost and lost again
And no one knows where the night is going ...
One by the guests arrive
The guests are coming through
The broken-hearted many
The open-hearted few
And no one knows where the night is going ...<start>Give me a reason darling. Why he's better than me.
I stalked him everyday I can't find a single thing.
You're hearing voices saying you should take me back.
I'll make this easy for you. Sit back and relax.
I am the greatest. The greatest you'll ever have. And I'm gonna haunt you. I'm gonna haunt you and I'm not gonna stop.
When you see a man at your window that's not a fucking ghost.
When you feel a draft on your shoulder that's not a wind that blows.
I'm not obsessive, I'm a martyr for our love.
Just give up the fight now baby, I know you've had enough.
I am the greatest. The greatest you'll ever have. And I'm gonna haunt you. I'm gonna haunt you and I'm not gonna stop.<start>Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through
Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never ending
Wouldn't it be nice?
Maybe if we think, and wish, and hope, and pray, it might come true
Baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married
And then we'd be happy
Wouldn't it be nice?
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
Wouldn't it be nice?<start>I am one,
In this place,
No one feels my disgrace.
I am one in this room
No one sees, but I see you
...wanted
...lost me
...finally
...L.A.
I've been there,
Nights unseen
Dusk will breathe,
...hiding me
And every breath, of every hour
Tells me how I've lost the power...
...help me
...watch me
...Secada...
In my room it's still the same
In my mind I'll move again<start>Come to silver
Come to gold
Come do any old thing
Sell your body and soul
Make you kill a man
Ruin your soul
Come to silver
Come to gold
Come to silver
Just as hard as you can
Come do anything
For life of sin
You can have everything
Big house up on a hill
Come to silver
Come to kill
Come downhearted
Come to gold
It'll make you lose your way
Turn your heart so cold
Steal the wife of another man
Let money buy her love
Gonna be some hard time
When you come to gold
If you come to silver
If you come to gold
Hope that you're happy
With the life you've sown
Coulda had everything
But you didn't want to know
You had to come to silver
You had to come to gold
You had to come to gold
You had to come to gold
You had to come to gold<start>Every trick in the book, now baby.
I use it on you.
I've got my devices darling
My machinery too.
Laying on a parquet carpet
On the Fourth of July.
Trying to find some physics books.
Things to try.
[Chorus:]
'Cause, now I've made my mind up.
You're going to be mine.
I tell you right now.
Every trick inn the book.
I use it on you.
I've got my devices turning.
My paprika too.
Trying to find a yellow cab where,
you lost your purse.
Trying to find some cabbage and celery,
and PAPRIKA.
Listening to Julio Iglesias
In a hot air balloon.
I've got my devices turning.
My paprika too.
Now I've made my mind up.
Now I've made my mind up.
Now I've made my mind up.
Now I've made my...
I've made my mind up.
Fry your little mind.
Fry your little mind.
Take it like a...
Take it like a...
Fry your little mind.
Fry your little mind.
Fry your little...
Take it, take it, take it, take it, take...
Fry your little mind.
Trying to find a yellow cab where,
you lost your... head.<start>You told me once, back at it again
Always the same with it, I can't stop you
Well maybe it's true for you, but I'm not seeing it
You wanna live with it, but I've got no room
Well maybe it's true for you, and I won't stop you
Give me some space to breathe, 'cause I've got no room
Well maybe it's true for you, and I can't stop you
Give me some space to breathe, 'cause I can't rest here with you
I've gotta be reasonable
But it's all become too predictable
I'm letting it ride, but I'm not losing sleep
This future is not up to you
Rise up for the innocent
Tried it on but it didn't fit
Guard down, there's a subtle flame
Subtle moment to have your say
Lining up opposite of me
What a moment of clarity
A shining moment to say...
For what? I know, so what!
I'm not about it, you can have it
I've gotta be reasonable
But it's all become too predictable
I'm letting it ride, but I'm not losing sleep
This future is not up to you
I'm not losing sleep
Rise up for the innocent
Tried it on but it didn't fit
Guard down, there's a subtle flame
Subtle moment to have your say.<start>you're like angels, so beautiful, it makes me cry
all my dreams of you rain down from the weeping sky
like roses you flourish in my heart and hurt with your thorn
flowers die in the cold, turn to gold, to be reborn
you're deeper than all oceans
your sighing sounds so sweet, even when you sleep
silently beats my heart with addictive smart
fire in paradise mirrors in my eyes
roses of red flower in my head
roses smell so sweet till they start to weep
you're passion, you take me high and make me cry
you're protagonist in all love poems
you're sin, chill on my skin
my heartbeat is your voice, i have no choice
when your arrow hits my heart the roses start to burn<start>Oh, I know you've been cheatin' on me, baby
And I know you don't mean me no good
Hey, I know you've been cheatin' on me, baby
And I know you don't mean me no good
That's why I blame myself, baby
Because I didn't treat you like I should
Oh, I was too good to you baby
I gave you everything I own
Oh, I was too good, too good to you, baby
Gave you everything I own
That's why I blame myself, baby
Every time you do me wrong
Hey, you've got your eyes wide open, baby
But you're traveling down the wrong road
Oh, your eyes is wide open, baby
But your traveling down the wrong road
A wine drinkin' and a cheatin' woman
Is one thing I can't afford<start>You came into my life, I don't have to wonder no more
I can feel it all in my soul
It's soul music, it's deep down in my soul, feel the burn
I can see I got a good foundation, deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul, it's soul music
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul
Yo, first took breath in Hemstead, Long Island
Born American, ancestry from Ireland
You ain't knowin' me, you better stop smilin'
Ain't nothin' funny once my dummies start whilin'
You talkin' loud now all a sudden it's silent
Your premenitions say it's about to get violent
You want permission just to blink your own eyelid
I got my soldiers, everywhere they go, I win
No stick moves, ain't no cap peeling
Where I come from real men don't catch feelings
We don't rhyme about fake jacks or drug dealin'
The shit I drop will leave all your brains on the ceiling
Mass appealin', done it since the 80's
Rock rhymes for my dogs, sing songs for my ladies
Spend money like crazy, ain't got no babies
If I don't make it in Heaven I'll run shit in Hades
Now I can see I got a good foundation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul, it's soul music
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul
It's in my soul, soul music
And I can feel a dark sensation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul, soul music
Tryin' to find an explanation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul
Yo I shit on competition, spit on percussion
Beats are bone crushin', one deep I'm bum rushin'
Guns they get stuck in, someone starts buckin'
The jewels that I'm truckin' got pimps upchuckin'
You can't hold me down, you can't hold my hand
A full grown man with the one God plan
I represent the colors that never run
God bless DMC, God bless Reverend Run
R.I.P. for the JMJ
Tell BIG and Scott LaRock that we all say hey
Be like 2Pac or be like Kid N Play
Do you want to burn out or just fade away
And I can rock the mic without no delay
With my head to the ground everytime I pray
You can catch a heart attack or get blown away
Cause this type of shit happens everyday
Feel the burn, I can feel it in my soul
It's soul music, it's deep down in my soul
Feel the burn, it's in my soul
It's soul music, it's deep down in my soul, feel the burn
Now I can see I got a good foundation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul, it's soul music
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul
It's in my soul, soul music
And I can feel a dark sensation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul, soul music
Tryin' to find an explanation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul, feel the burn<start>My first trip to Mars
All alone in the empty of the sky
One space boy gets his chance
To finally wave goodbye
My first trip to Mars, my first trip to Mars
Dying age of a spiritual machine
No response just void-less cyber-optic dreams
My headset screams, my headset bleeds
With Ransom's static prayer's and pleas
My spirit sifted, orbit shifted, creating my own gravity
My first trip to Mars, my first trip to mars
I wanna stay, I wanna stay
Don't wanna see it, don't wanna see it
I wanna stay, I wanna stay
Don't wanna see it, don't wanna see it
I wanna stay, I wanna stay
I wanna stay, I wanna stay
My first trip to Mars, my first trip to mars

My eyes will turn to green
My voice will turn to mellow
But still I can't be seen
Melt away
I wanna melt away
Melt away
Can you tell the difference
Or do I sound the same?
I do just what I want to do
This is my favorite game
Melt away
I wanna melt away
Melt away<start>Everytime we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet
Every roommate kept awake
By every silent scream we make
All the feelings that I get
But I still don't missed you yet
Only when I stop to think about it
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you
Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet
Only when I stop to think about it
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you
Only when I stop to think about you
I know
Only when you stop to think about me
Do you know
I hate everything about you

You hate everything about me
Why do you love me

Chorus
Hold me closer ladyboy, there's a rope that's dragging you out of this world
It doesn't care if you're heavy girl
Hold me closer ladyboy, if you look you can see that it's just you and me
There's nothing left of our world
So you think it's a sin, I bet it's a miracle
You think that you're safe, I tell you you're critical
The merciless gods who sometimes pour down their scorn
They cannot die and also cannot be born

I understand, I understand, I understand

the sound of it reminds you of your past and how nothing ever changes
the clocks inside your head will strike midnight every night
you stare at walls and paint with your memory
and you won't ever make it, cause nothing here ever changes
you wipe the dirt from off your dress
and smile politely at your guests, and hold your breath that no one saw you on your knees
your diary's a requiem, of all the things come and gone
of times and boys and places you will never find
and you won't ever make it, cause nothing ever changes

And I'm to weak to face this fight,
As I lie awake this sleepless night,
Tick tock goes the minutes finger,
Click clack of the loaded gun,
Haunted down by my demons as I try to run,
Hold on to your life,
There's so much for you to give this time around,
I know you don't feel right,
But there's a reason for it all,
And you just have to face this fight.
Two linked murders getting closer,
But it's all in my mind,
Is it fate only wanting closure?
For all my wasted time,
Now I am digging deeper,
Inside so I can find,
A way to face my demon side,
Hold on to your life,
There's so much for you to give this time around,
I know you don't feel right,
But there's a reason for it all,
And you just have to face this fight.
Late at night when you're sick and sleeping,
You never know what just might come to mind,
Just when life gives you happy feelings,
These demons might come and pick a fight,
Hold on to your life,
There's so much for you to give this time around,
I know you don't feel right,
But there's a reason for it all,
And you just have to face this fight.<start>Should we ignore
This was too intense
Too awful
Please stand still
To seize them all
His monetary gain equals
His monetary mind
Even if the saints gave their all
Like lions in the face of a
Growing crowd
Too little and too late on the day
When all will fall
So drawing into one another keeps
Momentum driving forward like a
Torching sun
Could sleep forever
In spite of this look
A look so scared
Sitting here with nothing new
To add
And crying out you never seemed
Forced
It's just the kind of fuel that I need
To feel reborn
Feeding off the chase right before
Is like biting into ankles
Pulling round
To finish one more phase
Get the key
When all will fall
So drawing into one another keeps
Momentum driving forward like a
Torching sun

Then stitch your arm to me
So drawing into one another keeps
Momentum driving forward like a
Torching sun<start>Lung sneeze me out

Led Zeppelin
This fountain pen
Will kill all men
Brain-dead, and bearing arms
Cowboys, and cut cigars

you dream of our fortunes
but you're wrong.
i don't belong to you
the moon is the only friend i have outside
one more drink & i'll be healed
i told you the words & then knew it was a lie
i wish i could offer an appeal
you're wrong
i don't belong to you
what i'd give for that first night when you were mine
tried with all that i have to keep you alive
i wasn't taught this way with a thousand things to say
i was born with a broken heart
what i'd give for that first night
you were mine
so i'll put this cigarette to bed
pull some sheets from off your side
i put my arm around you safe in the night
still dreaming of fortune
but you're wrong
i don't belong.<start>AYREON UNDERSTANDS THAT HE WAS NOT INDIVIDUALLY CHOSEN
FOR THE 'TIME TELEPATHY EXPERIMENT',
BUT THAT HE UNINTENTIONALLY RECEIVED ITS TRANSMISSIONS.
THIS COULD BE BECAUSE OF A MORE DEVELOPED SIXTH SENSE
AS A RESULT OF HIS BLINDNESS.
HE ALSO REALISES THAT HE CAN NEITHER ACCOMPLISH HIS MISSION,
NOR STOP THE VISIONS FROM PENETRATING HIS MIND.
HIS SOLE ESCAPE IS TO SUBMIT TO THE MAGIC CHARM OF THE GREAT SEER MERLIN.
[AYREON:]
I've been lost in the valley of nightmares
I've been found in the garden of dreams
speak thy charm, I know you are out there
cast thy spell and silence the screams
but as I poise on the edge of life
where time disappears
I bow in fear
to the charm of the seer
I've seen fear in valiant faces
I've seen hope in desperate eyes
lead me home to familiar places
lead me back to crystalline skies
and as I poise on the edge of life
where time disappears
I bow in fear
to the charm of the seer
I have failed, I have been forsaken
I've been scorned and misunderstood
I have lost, my life has been taken
I'd surrender if only I could<start>And in the mix
The greatest hits were made of this
And all the while it hurts to smile
It hurts to talk
Never have I seen so many frames move with it
I'll be the same
It hurts to talk
And in the same story
Coming down again
But you won't change my life
You won't change me<start>Freidlich durch das Leben gehn

bevor Ihr sprecht<start>It's going to break and I can see it in your eyes,
All the choices made
You won't be looking back this time
Tell me what's left to say when it falls apart
Just look at where we're coming from
And how it's going to end
Where do we turn, when there's nothing left but regret and
We seem miles apart?
We tried to make it last, do you remember that? Will you be looking back in time?
Tell me, what can we say to try and bridge the gap?
Just look at where we're coming from
Does it really have to end?
Where do we turn, when there's nothing left but regret and
We seem miles apart?
Can't we change the past, and even after all the efforts made
We still seem to go our separate ways
But how did it ever come to this
And can we try to make a change?
We need to give this all our effort
Let's try to never let each other slip away,
Because this is all we have
Different Directions
Let's keep it clear What I need from you is just a little space
Don't understand the goals I've set
Or the choices that I've made
Days fly by in the blink of an eye
And I find that years have past
Can't spend my life chasing expectations you've set
Let's keep it clear what I need from you is just a little space
Don't understand the goals I've set
Or the choices that I've made
Years fly by in the blink of an eye
And I'll find that I've grown old
So much to do and so little time
And I can't live these days for you
That's not the way I want to live
So I'm always going to push it away,
You need to give me room to breathe
I want to live, live the life that I know is right for me
I want to live, and I know my mistakes
Are just lessons learned
I want to live, live the life that I know is right for me, drug free
I want to live, can't you see what's right?
If it's not my choice, then it's not my life
And I want to live, live my own life<start>On the highway
On the freeway
In the airport
In the airplane
In the airtrain
In Brooklyn, U.S.A.
To a Tinsel Town
Where now
What the Dodgers play
And where they fired it
Where they tried it
Where they doubled it
Where they tripled it
Where they flippin' it
And where the car's parked
Where the girls dance naked
Where they know when you're fakin' it
And where the rubber meets the road, yeah
Where the hot meets the cold, poor meet the soul
Where the young meet the old, truth be told
I got somethin' on my mind, y'all gotta know
I got a brother named Lee who looks just like me
He gotta lotta enemies
Got a brother named Lee who looks just like me

When they lookin' at her and say 'so fine'
When they keep saying it was suicide
When they never seen that look in her father's eye

And where the hot meet the cold, the spirit meet the soul
The young meet the old, I say truth be told

Both sides of the Mississippi<start>As I stare into the flames
filled up with feelings I can't name
Images of life appear --
regret and anger, love and fear
Dark things drift across the screen
of mine behind whose veil are seen
love's ferocious eyes, and clear
the words come flying to my ear
Go on -- put it in your heart --
Put it in your heart
Terrible deeds done in the name
of tunnel vision and fear of change
surely are expressions of
a soul that's turned its back on love
All the sirens all the tongues
The song of air in every lung
Heaven's perfect alchemy
put me with you and you with me
Come on -- put that in your heart
Come on, put it in your heart
All the sirens all the tongues
The song of air in every lung
Heaven's perfect alchemy
Put me with you and you with me
Come on, put it in your heart
Come on, put it in your heart<start>Every day
I sweated away
I got up early in the morning to earn my daily bread
Dud everything
All they said
But the more I did the more I got mad
Didn't like that life
Yeah, I was young
But at this time me dreams had begun
I wanted to be
Forever free
So I gave up this life to take the road
Oh... road to never-neverland
Even you can't see an end - it's not far away
Oh... road to never-neverland
Just goin' straight to reach the end - it's not far away
Every day - I play guitar
Just to stay alive - not to be a star
I'm not rich - but I'm not poor
Beacause I've got a freedom now that makes me feel secure
Ups downs all on my way
But I hold out to the last 'cause I wanna stay
On the road that never ends
To reach me dreams - my own never-neverland
Oh... road to never-neverland
Even you can't see an end - it's not far away
Oh... road to never-neverland
Just goin' straight to reach the end - it's not far away<start>I've been flat broke had dirt on my knees
But it's going alright now, Know what I mean?
I've disguised poverty kept my chin up
But life's like that, know what I mean?
War across the nation
Fighting degradation
Don't stop for their excuses
If you do they'll just abuse it
Life's unreal 'cos there's people with thousands
Something wrong somewhere, Know what I mean?
Hope for a day when justice will come forth
Chance would be a fine thing, know what I mean?<start>lauo viesa naktyje

And all this time I never noticed
All you ever had were hidden motives
You're just a curse, another lie, another waste of my time
Until you go away, go away then
You only see me inside of this skin
Conventional friend, you've taken the best
You've taken the best and thrown it away
I'm obliged to forget you after all is said
And all this time I tried to fix you
Was just another way to avoid the issue
You're just a ruse, another guise, another waste of my time
Until you go away, go away then
You only see me inside of this skin
Conventional friend, you've taken the best
You've taken the best and thrown it away
And no, no, I won't get over this
It's a little too late, I'm going insane
You gotta get, no, no I gotta get away
Oh, this is gonna fuck with my head
And I'll be looking for it in the end

Was after we'd been close in dreams
Was after we'd shared hell and heaven
And all the places in-between
And all the places in-between
After we'd spent nights together
And breathed secrets without words
After we'd made promises
That could but might not have been heard
Might not have been heard
Knowing me the way you do
Then why did you just say
That our first day together
Was today?<start>My love's an ice-cold latte
And it's running down yer shirt
You took my little heart
And then ya threw it in the dirt
I won't go near yer locker
And I cannot wash my hair
I can't believe you betrayed me
And filled me with despair
I can't believe
Horrible truth about you
Because you lied to me
I am only the girl
Who was in love with you
But, now you lied
I have developed frog-eyes
From crying all the time
I won't go out
And skate with my friends
I'll only stay inside
You ran around, behind my back
With a pretty, blue-eyed girl
I am so sick of missing you
I think I'm gonna hurl
I can't believe
Horrible truth about you
Because you lied to me
I am only the girl
Who was in love with you
But, now you lied
I can't believe you lied to me
I can't believe you
(I am only the girl who was in love with you)
I can't believe
Horrible truth about you
Because you lied to me
I am only the girl
Who was in love with you
But, now you lied to me
{Bif:} {sportin' the "x"s on her hands} Self-discipline requires doing
What is necessary, when it should be done,
Whether it is a pleasant task or not
A straight-edge lifestyle is personal choice
If my coffee consumption
Ain't straight-edge enough for you
Then **** me with a double, skim cappuccino
{Bif:} Um: hellooooo!!
Get a ******* hold of yourself!!
No complaining!!
Are you starving?
No?
Then let's have a little perspective,
Shall we see a therapist
Switch to decaf, lay off the pills
Try some stretching
Take five
Have a time out
Write it down
Make a painting
Have a hot bath
Quit hanging onto past hurts
Forgive all to get over all
And get on with it!
Puh-leeeze!
Develop some humor
Laugh it off
Yuk it up
Don't be mean
Karma is instant
There is no coincidence
Live today
Try - ok?

Dejame Alucinar
Q' estoy muy sediento
Quero dejarme llevar
No sentir dolor
Cansado y
De ir contra el viento y saber
Q'l pasado fue cruel
Q'l presente lo es ms
Hoy sigo viendo
A la misma mujer
Trotando calles por que
le fue mal
No me importa volver a empezar
Y si es blanco o negro q' mas da
Es muy facil criticar
Prefiero crear
Quiero saborear la luz
De la oscuridad
Vueltas y vueltas
En el mismo lugar
Tanto miedo a crecer
Tanto miedo a luchar
Aun sigo viendo
A la gente pelear
Por un poco de pan
Por q' hoy le fue mal
No me importa volver a empezar
Y si es blanco o negro q' ms da
Cansado y
De volver a encontrar
El mismo odio, el dolor
La misma envidia, el rencor
Hoy sigo viendo
Q's mas facil seguir
La huella q' alguien dejo
Me fue mal
Javier Alzrreca (transcript)
Coda 3, Bolivia<start>Pick away at my bones, There's nothing left to see
I've been forever drowning in what you want to be
The soonest I'd be leaving isn't quick enough for me
I don't need a reason to be free
Breathe my life until you see
There's nothing left for me
I've wasted far too long
Feel nothing after a time
Don't know why, down my spine
Grieving is unrefined
Can't cross the line
I look for a sign
Can you conceal the way you feel
And what you steal from what is real and
Breathe my life until you see
There's nothing left for me
I've wasted far too long
wasted far to long
Breathe my life until you see
There's nothing left for me
I've wasted far too long<start>Hit with the bug to run, you didn't go to college we can use you son
You look like the pride of your home town
But how can you hold out when your luck is down
[Chorus]
Ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame.
Because I'm too tired to run around
Meeting people from the wrong side of town
Looking for a place to live, I've got no money nothing to give, listen
All you gotta do is look around for something that's new
find a job that's stimulating, that's easy and I'm still waiting
(Chorus)
I've stood in line and done my time
With nothin' to do all day
I've stood in line with all my friends
With nothin' to say all day,
I've stood in line and done my time
With nothin' to do all day
I've stood in line with all my friends
With nothin' to say all day, nothin' to say all day.
Got brains but got no drive
Money's cheap, the roads are wide
All the good positions go too fast
I need a job I know will last
I've got a job for you can you push that shovel can you swing that broom
Keep your head down and don't go slow
But don't forget to stop with the whistle.
(Chorus<start>Only you know and I know
All the love that we've got to show
So don't refuse to believe it
By reading too many meanings
Cause you know that I mean what I say
So don't go and ever take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on gettin' your own way
Cause if you do it's gonna get you someday
I appear to be pleasin'
Oh no no not deceivin'
But it's hard to believe it
Aw, yeah when you been so mistreated
Cause you know that I mean what I say
So don't go and ever take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on gettin' your own way
Cause if you do it's gonna get you someday
If I seem to mislead you
It's just my craziness comin' through
But when it comes down to just two
Aw I ain't no crazier than you
Cause you know that I mean what I say
So don't go and ever take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on gettin' your own way
Cause if you do it's gonna get you someday
Only you know and I know
All the love that we've got to show
So don't refuse to believe it
By reading too many meanings<start>Some stupid guy with his head in the clouds
Thinks the world is a wondrous place
Next thing you know as he's looking around
Plane hits him in the face
A sight for sore eyes are couples who think
Marriage is not for them
They want their children to know their dad
Is only their partner's friend
I'm going backwards the way I came in
Going forward the same way out
I've got some blue chips to go with my fish
Which is still swimming round about
The sight of a pedophile being abused
A stalker being followed home
Who wouldn't give their right arm to see
A scientist being cloned
What do you do when your think you're in love
And she tells you you must be sure
How do you manage to get out of that
When you know that her heart is pure
On the wings of a dove fight has broken out
Someone flew in a rage hurling drinks about
I'm gonna love you as long as I can
For as long as we both agree
I'm gonna leave you the rest of my life
Along with some jewelry
A sight for sore eyes are couples who think
There's no need for men
If they want a child they just go to a lab
Get it artificially insemmed
Some stupid guy has his arm in a lock
And he can't seem to find the key
Someone should tell him it's probably where
The key to his heart would be
And I'll cry like a big girl
And I'll kick like an ass
Who needs 18/30
50 plus is a gas
I'm gonna love you as long as I can
For as long as we both shall live
I'm going to leave you the rest of my life
For as long as it's mine to give
As long as it's mine to give<start>"I'm the Sheik of Araby,
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you're asleep
Into your tent I'll creep.
The stars that shine above,
Will light our way to love.
You'll rule this land with me;<start>Paso noches hablando de vos
Este es mi insÃ³lito monÃ³logo
De hoy me cuelgo y me empiezo
A preguntar
Si tu quilmes jugarÃ¡
En el mÃ¡s allÃ¡
Lo enciendo frente al rÃ­o
De la plata sin dudar
(con mÃ¡s ganas de creer que de pensar)
Porque tus sueÃ±os como el viento
Vuelven desde tu ciudad
Para darle a lo que siento
AlgÃºn lugar en tu eternidad
Las estrellas se apagaron en el sur
Subiste y sÃ³lo
Brilla tu luz
Tan hermosa, como janis
Y su blues
Hoy no te tengo
Y solo, cargo con mi cruz
Estas historias
Nunca tienen fin
Y mÃ¡s si en este tema
Hablo de mÃ­
Los recuerdos
Calientan mi interior
Y mÃ¡s si en este tema
Hablo de vos
Mil canciones
Y una mÃ¡s voy a

Y en mil silencios

You can't forget her
Can't run, can't hide
When you remember
Nights that won't fade away
Yea fade away
Well I still go crazy
When you hear her name
Feels like you just left today
And it drives you insane
But you keep holding on
Yeah holding on
In the back of my mind
You live all the time
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
Every night, every day
That's where you still play
In the back of my mind
When I close my eyes
You can still touch her
And I fantasize
She's still your lover
When I wake up I see
The only place you'll be
I know where you'll be
In the back of my mind
You live all the time
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
Every night, every day
That's where you still play
In the back of my mind
I remember your eyes burning bright
Like we touched the summer sun
I can see your shadow standing there
On the streets where we used to run
Remember
In the back of my mind
You live all the time
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
Every night, every day
That's where you still play
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
You live all the time

Let's make a Tennessee River run
Hey everybody, I think the time is right
Let's get together down where the catfish bite
Cooped up all winter waitin' on a day like this
It's the way I feel when I'm rockin' on the water
Baby that I can't resist
BBQ grill, summertime jam
Just about a mile above the Pickwick dam
Party on the water, whole lotta fun
Time to make a Tennessee River run
I'll get my bass boat, crank up your party barge
We'll drop these anchors out where the big boats are
Break out a cooler, pass out some ice cold beer
Look at all the people out here on the water
Man I can't believe we're here
Swingin' on a rope, gonna have a ball
Jumpin' off the Yellow Creek waterfall
Checking out the honeys baking in the sun
God bless a Tennessee River run
Doo-doo-n-doo-dee
Oh what a weekend, we've had some time to play
I should be leavin', tomorrow's a work week day
I just might call in, tell 'em that I can't get home
Does anybody want to stay a little longer
Or am I gonna be alone?
Floatin' on a tube, gonna weigh a ton
Cajun sausage on a hot dog bun
B-B-Q grill, summertime jam
Just about a mile above the Pickwick dam
Party on the water, whole lot of fun
Time to make a Tennessee River run
Doo-doo-n-doo-dee
Nothing like a Tennessee River run

Riding through the forest
Through the trees, across the seas
Storming through the tempest
Will you surrender
Will you surrender
Oh will you all surrender
Now will you surrender
Do you fear the word of him
Who makes a lie unwritten
No rose was born without a thorn
Since first the fruit was bitten
Do you fear the word of him
Who makes a lie unwritten
No rose was born without a thorn
Since first the fruit was bitten<start>My cousin PJ gets crazy just as much as he can
A real party reptile for a northern man
He's dressed like a republican
He thinks conservative
But he drives faster than I ever did
He's into nuclear power and insider deals
He has a scene with baby oil and heels
He's my favorite politician
When he comes on weird
Says I'm not fit for this office let's get out of here
My, my, loves his ma and apple pie
Well, well, he's the party's favorite guy
I hope you like it
You know I'm going to take good care of you
I hope you like it
I hope next time you bring your friends with you
He's a drinkin', huntin', shootin', fishin' son of a gun
He knows a surgeon's gonna keep his wife young
Got industrial kickbacks in an offshore bank
Knows who to stand on and he knows how to thank
I hope you like it
You know I'm going to take good care of you
I hope you like it
I hope next time you bring your friends with you
My, my, loves his ma and apple pie
Well, well, he's the party's favorite guy
He likes to come take me for a night with the boys
He talks about the NRA and their toys
Got an automatic rifle in his pick up truck
He drives me home when he's in no state to walk
My, my, loves his ma and apple pie
Well, well, he's the party's favorite guy
I hope you like it
You know I'm going to take good care of you
I hope you like it
I hope next time you bring your friends with you
I hope you like it
Love it, like it
I hope you like it
Love it, like it<start>I fear that I'm losing what little was mine
I gave you control and you're robbing me blind
I showed you my soul and you took all I had
Blind, mained, disfigured you left me for dead
I look out my window down on
the street/ See all the people crushed out by defeat
See all the suffering it shines in their eyes
Pushed to the limits humanity dies
We go on slaving day after day
Just to survive collecting our pay
And to the rich go all the spoils
And to the poor degradation and toil
You stole all my time corrupted my mind
Made all your profits and left me behind
Treated me like nothing,a line on a chart
It's your mindless Tedium that tore me apart<start>You know what, Stuart, I LIKE YOU. You're not like the other
People, here, in the trailer park.
Oh, don't go get me wrong. They're fine people, they're
Good Americans. But they're content to sit back, maybe
Watch a little Mork and Mindy on channel 57, maybe kick
Back a cool, Coors 16-ouncer. They're good, fine people,
Stuart. But they don't know ... what the queers are doing
To the soil!
You know that Jonny Wurster kid, the kid that delivers papers
In the neighborhood. He's a foreign kid. Some of the neighbors
Say he smokes crack, but I don't believe it.
Anyway, for his tenth birthday, all he wanted was a Burrow Owl.
Kept bugging his old man. "Dad, get me a burrow owl. I'll never
Ask for anything else as long as I live." So the guy
Breaks down and buys him a burrow owl.
Anyway, 10:30, the other night, I go out in my yard, and there's
The Wurster kid, looking up in the tree. I say, "What are
You looking for?" He says "I'm looking for my burrow owl."
I say, "Jumping Jesus on a Pogo Stick. Everybody knows
The burrow owl lives. In a hole. In the ground. Why the hell do you
Think they call it a burrow owl, anyway?" Now Stuart, do you
Think a kid like that is going to know what the queers are
Doing to the soil?
I first became aware of this about ten years ago, the summer
My oldest boy, Bill Jr. died. You know that carnival comes into
Town every year? Well this year they came through with a ride
Called The Mixer. The man said, "Keep your head, and arms, inside
The Mixer at all times." But Bill Jr, he was a DAAAREDEVIL, just
Like his old man. He was leaning out saying "Hey everybody,
Look at me! Look at me!" Pow! He was decapitated! They found
His head over by the snow cone concession.
A few days after that, I open up the mail. And there's a pamphlet
In there. From Pueblo, Colorado, and it's addressed to Bill, Jr.
And it's entitled, "Do you know what the queers are doing to our
Soil?"
Now, Stuart, if you look at the soil around any large US city,
There's a big undeground homosexual population. Des Moines, Iowa,
For an example. Look at the soil around Des Moines, Stuart.
You can't build on it; you can't grow anything in it. The government
Says it's due to poor farming. But I know what's really going on,
Stuart. I know it's the queers. They're in it with the aliens.
They're building landing strips for gay Martians, I swear to
God.
You know what, Stuart, I like you. You're not like the other
People, here in this trailer park.<start>We have a certain calling to rise above the rest,
Even when our human nature says we're not the best.
And when trials and tribulations can put you to the test.
God is for us. None's against us. Don't be stressed.
Have a good look at how it's gonna be when our army of servants destroys the enemy.
Decide in your hearts whose side you really on.
Don't wait for us to be dead and gone.
Don't be afraid.
We're all around.
Let the truth introduce itself.
More than conquerors.
More than few.
More than anyone.
More than you.<start>Where do we go from here now that all other children are growin' up
And how do we spend our lives if there's no one to lend us a hand
I don't want to live here no more, I don't want to stay
Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life, quietly fading away
Games people play, you take it or you leave it
Things that they say, honor bright
If I promise you the moon and the stars, would you believe it
Games people play in the middle of the night
Where do we go from here now that all of the children have grown up
And how do we spend our lives knowin' nobody gives us a damn
I don't want to live here no more, I don't want to stay
Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life, quietly fading away
Games people play, you take it or you leave it
Things that they say, just don't make it right
If I'm telling you the truth right now, do you believe it
Games people play in the middle of the night
Games people play, you take it or you leave it
Things that they say, honor bright
If I promise you the moon and the stars, would you believe it
Games people play in the middle of the night
Games people play, you take it or you leave it
Things that they say, just don't make it right
If I'm telling you the truth right now, do you believe it
Games people play in the middle of the night<start>Who thanked the Lord for the clothes
That she wore and mended,
Nellie with the big old fashioned eyes
Who won the heart of a crowd
Tore apart, took a bow,
Nellie there's a different world backstage
[Chorus]
I see the flood lights burning
I hear the band play on
Now Nellie takes her bow
She said she really could not stay
She had a brand new play to play
And so she paints her face and smiles
And she'll be someone else in a while
[Chorus]
Just a lonely girl who could not face a broken world,
And so she acts out all her dreams and wishes that's how it had been
But when the audience is near, it seems as though she doesn't even care.
[Chorus]
Nellie just sent me a line to tell me she was doing fine
She got the lead and on Broadway, and now they're digging her today
And as she turns the final page, living
Someone's life upon the stage
[Chorus]<start>Looked in the papers, looked in the magazines
Wanted to find out, to know.
Was there an answer, was there really something.
Hidden beneath them below.
Searched in the light and underneath the pictures.
Something was written there.
And through the smiles and under all the color
A message on everything there.
[Chorus]
But it's not imagination
Not imagination
It's not me, look and see for yourself.
Didn't believe it, although I saw myself.
Wanted to look there again,
But it was real and everybody saw it.
When it was shown, pointed out to them,
S.e.xisting, s.e.x.exciting
Written where it doesn't show.
What do we see, the product or the message.
So hard to tell I don't know.
[Chorus]
But it's not imagination
Not imagination
It's not me, look and see for yourself.<start>Covered and coarse
I could wait my turn
Too pay them all back
So Original,
Let's take it all back
You could hide but I won't, how do you know?
I can't believe it!
Take it away!
One look and you'll never leave,
Cause this can't hold, us down.
If I wake up
On my own
If something happens
Please come home
Wake me up before you go.
If you never know
It can never hurt
As much as this does
It's so original
Let's make this all work
You can run but I won't, how do you know?
I can't believe it!
Take it away!
One look and you'll never leave,
Cause this won't hold us down.
If I wake up
On my own
If something happens
Please come home
Wake me up before you go on.
You can't hold us down
This won't hold us down
You can't hold us down
If you wake up
On your own
If something happens
Please come home
Wake me up before you go
I hope you're happy on your own<start>Hey little girl, you sure are cute to me
Come up a little closer, so I can see
Hold it baby now stay right where you are
Hey little girl you oughta be a movie star
All right...
Hey little girl, come on and dance with me
You're about the cutest thing I ever did see
Hey little girl, I'd like to take you home
Come on, come on, come on I want you for my very own
All right...hoo!...hoo!..
Hey little girl, you better hang on tight
A-won't you swing it to the left, and shake it to the right
Hey little girl, you know your lookin' fine
Get ready honey let's go just-a one more time<start>Wash up
Bowl of mush
Look I made America
Hush hush
Don't don't rush
Time for quiet
Time to brush
Brown wine
Turpentine
Everything will be just fine
Sleep now
Never fear
All your animals are here
Counting sheep
I lay me down to sleep
But I see a sheep that will not leave
From the back they catch him in a trap
Hit his head and send him off to bed
Cutting by numbers is kinder
Invest in one with a silencer
All of the studies say if they're
Calm when they die then they taste better
Cutting by numbers is kinder
Invest in the one with the silencer
All of the studies say if they're
Calm when they die then they taste better
Goodbye
Olive sky
I am crying all the time
There there
Don't despair
We will find your sheep somewhere<start>A little on that's full of innocence
He doesn't know that something's out of place
Another one dreams murder all night
He's been living full of hatred all his life
Well, I guess it's always been this way
A world that's full of love and hate
Oh God, but will it stay this way
So much love, so much hate
[Chorus]
It goes on and on and on
Around and again
On and on and on
Around and again
It goes on and on and on
Around and again
A mother's willing to give her life
While another one throws away her child
A son stands and he turns the other cheek
While another one spits in a face while it bleeds
Well, I guess it's always been this way
A world that's full of love and hate
Oh God, but will it stay this way
So much love, so much hate
[Chorus: x2]
This evil that's within is hiding in our skin
This evil that's within is hiding in our skin
What are we
When will we
Why are we still wondering
What are we
When will we
Why are we still wondering
Oh Jesus, I can't take the hate anymore
Save us from ourselves before
We on and on and on
Around and again
[Chorus]
On and on and on
Around and again
It goes on and on and on
Around and again
[Chorus]
How long will it go
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
On and on and on
Around and again
Around and again<start>as i went down to the river to pray studying about that good old way and who shall were the sorry crown good lord show me the way<start>I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there
But she never comes
And I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes
And I rise to face another day
Without her
Without her, I can't go on
Without her, I can't go on
Without her, I can't go on
It's just no good anymore when you walk through the door
To an empty room
You go inside and set a table for one, it's no fun
When you have to spend a day
Without her, do do do...
Without her, do do do...
We burst the pretty balloon took us to the moon
It's such a beautiful thing
But it's ended now
And it sounds like a lie
I said I'd rather die than live without her
Without her
Love is a beautiful thing when it knows how to swing
And it moves like a clock
But the hands on the clock tell the lovers to part
And it's breaking my heart
To have to spend a day without her, do do do...
Can't go on without her
Without her, I can't go on
Without her, I can't go on
Without her, I can't go on
We burst the pretty balloon took us to the moon
It's such a beautiful thing
But it's ended now
And it sounds like a lie
I said I'd rather die than live without her
Without her
Without her, do do do...
It's so wrong without her
Can't go on
I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there
But she never comes
And I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes
And I rise to face another day
Without her, do do do...
Can't go on without her
There's no song without her
It's all wrong without her
Can't go on
I can't go on (without her) [repeat and fade]<start>In the Hold of Isaac's hand and led him to the lonesome hill
While his daughter hid and watched, she dare not breath.
She was so still.
Just as the angel cried for the slaughter, Abraham's daughter raised her voice.
The the angel asked her what her name was,
she said: "I have none."
Then he asked : "How can this be? "
"Me father never gave me one."
And when he saw her, raised the slaughter,
Abraham's daughter raised her bold.
How dare you child defy your father ? You better then young Isaac cold.<start>Sailing down behind the sun,
Waiting for my prince to come.
Praying for the healing rain
To restore my soul again.
Just a toe rag on the run.
How did I get here?
What have I done?
When will all my hopes arise?
How will I know him?
When I look in my father 's eyes.
My father 's eyes.
When I look in my father 's eyes.
My father 's eyes.
Then the light begins to shine
And I hear those ancient lullabies.
And as I watch this seedling grow,
Feel my heart start to overflow.
Where do I find the words to say?
How do I teach him?
What do we play?
Bit by bit, I 've realized
That 's when I need them,
That 's when I need my father 's eyes.
My father 's eyes.
That 's when I need my father 's eyes.
My father 's eyes.
Then the jagged edge appears
Through the distant clouds of tears.
I 'm like a bridge that was washed away;
My foundations were made of clay.
As my soul slides down to die.
How could I lose him?
What did I try?
Bit by bit, I 've realized
That he was here with me;
I looked into my father 's eyes.
My father 's eyes.
I looked into my father 's eyes.
My father 's eyes.
My father 's eyes.
My father 's eyes.
I looked into my father 's eyes.
My father 's eyes.<start>Oh sweet lungs don't fail me now
Your burning has turned into fear
Drills me in my every step, I'm moving quick but you're always on my heels
Just one more breath, I beg you please
Just one more step, my knees are weak
My heart is sturdy but it needs you to survive
My heart is sturdy but it needs you
Breathe, don't you want to breathe
I know that you are strong enough to handle what I need
My capillaries scream, there's nothing left to feed on
My body needs a reason to cross that line
Will you carry me there one more time?
Steady lungs, don't fail me now
I feel you bursting but you won't let me die
Fill me up with every step
I'm feeling sick, but I'm leaving it behind
Just one long breath I beg you please
Just one more step you are not weak
My legs are sturdy but they need you to survive
My heart is sturdy but I need you
Breathe, don't you want to breathe
I know that you are strong enough to handle what I need
My capillaries scream, there's nothing left to feed on
My body needs a reason to cross that line
Will you carry me there one more time?
I have reason to believe that I have victories to taste
I can feel them on my teeth, upon my lips and in my chest
I can roll them on my tongue, they are more subtle than defeat
I feel the tension in my lungs and every move is filled by my resolve to
Breathe, don't you want to breathe
I know that you are strong enough to handle what I need
My capillaries scream, there's nothing left to feed on
My body needs a reason to cross that line
Will you carry me there one more time?<start>The future teaches you to be alone
The present to be afraid and cold
So if I can shoot rabbits
Then I can shoot fascists
Bullets for your brain today
But we'll forget it all again
Monuments put from pen to paper
Turns me into a gutless wonder
And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
Will be next
Will be next
Will be next
Gravity keeps my head down
Or is it maybe shame
At being so young
And being so vain
Holes in your head today
But I'm a pacifist
I've walked las ramblas
But not with real intent
And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
Will be next
Will be next
Will be next
Will be next
And on the street tonight an old man plays
With newspaper cuttings of his glory days
And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
And if you tolerate thisThen your children will be next
And if you tolerate this

With newspaper cuttings of his glory days<start>I don't know what I should do
I don't know how to get through

I don't know what I should say
I don't know how to find a way
I'm so sad and lonley

I don't know how to be strong
I don't know how to get along
I'm so sad and lonley

'till I come to a higher place
I will find strength - let go
Of all the ties to my disgrace
I'm no more - and no less

Looking for a new horizon
I can find in myself

(it's all right) take me as I am
(yeah yeah yeah) 'cause here I stand
No hesitation - holdin' back
I'll take each step one by one
But I might fall - I could stray
If I loose my eye's today
I'm only one in a crowd
I'm just one voice on the line
Looking for a new horizon
Another place another time
Chorus
(it's all right) the shadow's gone
(shine your light) with the risin' sun
(it's all right) take me as I am
(yeah yeah yeah) 'cause here I stand
Coda: in our hands a light shines
We still wonder
Change our world into sand
We will hunger
Like a child -fears the night-
Draws near it's mother
Like a son -fears no one-
Will cast our shadow forever
'cause here I stand<start>Na na na na na na

You gotta steal your own fuel
Torn
Toiled and troubled

So don't change the story.
There's too much at stake to grow.
Yesterday was so great,
Just bask in the glory.
Don't let your feelings show.
And I say,
"Oh Yeah" like a man with condition
I wait for my heart to stop.
Stay down,
Got a plan hold that position.
You can't afford a flop.
Pack my suitcase
With my game face,
Take the same place,
And put away the dreams I had.
Let my hair grow,
Find some old clothes,
Let the world know
That my glory days were plaid.
[Chorus]
I'm not asking for permission,
Are you ready for me to be me.
Just pass the ammunition,
This prisoner's about to bust free from chains.
For so long you told me to keep it familiar,
Just play what they all would find,
I can wear this blindfold, stick to your story,
But I gotta ask myself why.
And I play those songs!
For so many seasons,
Till I'm sure I'm losing my mind.
And I say, Oh no,
Gotta have a much better reason
To leave all my dreams behind.
Strangers,
Rearrange us,
Stay the same fate,
And become your favorite fad.
With the see-through,
I gotta be true,
I can't be you.
While Yes still comes in plaid.
[Chorus].
I'm more than just excited,
Like a hundred pounds of monkey on my back.
Now everybody's divided,
We're riding this train till we run clear out of track.
Clean of track.

Rudies in court, now boys, rudies in court
Order, now, this court is in session
And I order all you rude boys to stand
You're brought here ?
Now tell me, rude boys
What have you to say for yourselves ?
Your honor, rudies don't fear
Rudies don't fear, no boys, rudies don't fear
Rudies don't fear, no boys, rudies don't fear
Rougher than rough, tougher than tough

Court adjourn<start>The piano players dead
Someone shot him in the head
I want to make sweet love to his fucking music
Who would've wanted the show to end this early?
I guess it's time for the curtain call
Listen to the symphony
Can you hear them play our fucking song?
Listen to our fucking love, yeah
The king said to rock it, shake, rattle n roll
But who's behind the piano if the piano players dead?
It sure as hell, ain't Elvis, so cut the fucking music<start>You're still playing that time-worn melody
Play it now for old time's sake once more
When you want me, you won't be usin' me
Like you've done a thousand times before
'Cause I found out now
You never change
Ain't no use in foolin' myself
You never change at all
You're still sayin'
That you're misunderstood
Won't go fallin' this time, that's for sure
All your methods won't do you any good
They've all been tried a thousand times before
'Cause I found out now
You never change
Ain't no use in foolin' myself
You never change at all
It ain't no use, you'll never change
Stop your runnin' around...<start>I've been alone with you inside my mind
And in my dreams, I kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
Hello
Is it me you're looking for?
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide
'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much
I love you
'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
Or is someone loving you?
Tell me how to win your heart
'Cause I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying<start>How do you whisper out loud?
Be all alone in a crowd?
Well.....
How do you manage to fly?
Breathe like the wind when you sigh?
Sun, burning like fire
She's not feeling the sun, look at her run
Looks like it's starting to rain
Can't quite decide who's to blame
And how do you manage to fly?
Breathe like the wind when you sigh?
Sun, burning like fire
She's not feeling the sun, look at her run
And it looks like it's starting to rain
Can't quite decide who's to blame
Well.....

Front line open intellection
Outlining all his imperfections

Screaming you want it and more
Sit down ambassador reference
Right now your voice is a weapon

Watch light revolve with your mind
Watch all the storms rising

No more failing acceptance

And make your halos the color of sinner's portraits
And smothering it means everything's lovely again
Nothing's quite as it seems
Society's all a disease
Kill all your fear in your sleep
Cuz everything's formed in a dream
Breathe in insanity's grip
Words from insanity's lips
Falling from sanity's cliff
Watching your vanity slip
No more falling to pressure
No more failing acceptance
Throw all your hells towards the heavens
Cuz your voice is a weapon

I don't stop till they tell me I've won
I don't know what I'm fighting for
I'm just a soldier aiming for one more
My family they cover me
My family they cover me
All I see is what I believe
I am not guilty, no
I am not guilty
I don't stop not even in my dreams
I don't stop seeing things that I've seen
I don't know why I raise this hell
I'm just a soldier fighting for someone else<start>Do you know what love is?
Love is when you willingly
Place someone else's priorities
Above your own
Do you know what lust is?
Lust is when you actively
Force your own priority
On someone else<start>Land ho! My name is Joe,
I drive a truck, steam roll.
Strong man, I got a plan,
Sing it all day, from land to land.
I swear I'm in fourth gear,
My rollers down, trail of smears.
Asphalt, aggregate,
No more trees, pavement.
That's odd, I feel like God,
My wrath of stone, struck my cud.
Cars, trees, pave the seas.
Everyone on your knees.
Ahhhhh.
Pave, pave, pave the world,
Pave, pave, pave the world.
Pave, pave, pave the world,
Pave, pave, pave the world.
Pave, pave, pave the world,
Pave, pave, pave the world.
Pave, pave, pave the world,
Pave, pave, pave the world.
"Ooh Joe! What have you done?
Your steam roll has spoiled our fun.
Asphyxiation, we're turning blue,
Ooh Joe, what can you do?"
Suck my... muffler pipe.
Pave the world... out of sight.
Eat shit... soil my shorts.
Pave the world... snort, snort!
Pave, pave, pave the world,

Take me as I am or let me go
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover
Take me as I am or let me go.
You're trying to reshape me in a moment
In the image of someone you used to know
I won't be a stand-in for an old love
Take me as I am or let me go.
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me
Take me as I am or let me go.
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me
Take me as I am or let me go.
You're trying to reshape me in a mold love
In the image of someone you used to know
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love
Take me as I am or let me go.<start>All, all it's not alright
Your role it played through time
Come and rescue me
You're needed here at home
And your space, a moment in time
A hand to hold a hand I tried
Who was it called to you?
Who called?
Your story's alive with hellos and goodbyes
Bright lights, first kiss and drunken nights
How I miss you
I miss you now and
Hey, I can't wait another day
And hey, that crooked smile upon your face
Oh they'll never get old
All the stories you told
From the beach to the ring
To the songs of your soul
How I miss you
And the rain
Falling cold outside
Covered me the day you died
You could have waited one more day
I should have called
I dream of your life, the war and the fight
The music you played, the love for your wife
And I miss you
I miss you now and
Hey, I can't wait another day
And hey, that crooked smile upon your face
Oh they'll never get old
All the stories you told
From the beach to the ring
To the songs of your soul
How I miss you
And I miss you
I miss you now and hey
And I'm mad at the age
That stole you away
By surviving that beach
You gave me my stay
And I understand by this that I am
All that you were was changed by that sand
But I miss you
I miss you now and
Hey, I can't wait another day
And hey, that crooked smile upon your face
Oh they'll never get old
All the stories you told
From the beach to the ring
To the songs of your soul
How I miss you
How I miss you<start>For days I have tried to forget you
And not care where you are
No matter where you are
But fables are not made from memories
I got to try to find
A way to ease my mind
You're like a sledgehammer
Clickin', clickin', on my mind
You're like a sledgehammer baby
You been beating on my mind
You're like a sledgehammer
You been sneakin' all the time, wow
You're like a sledgehammer baby
You been beating on my mind
For nights I have gone without sleeping
I wonder where you are
I wonder where you are
But I must build my castle with daydreams
And watch 'em fade away
Watch 'em fade away
You're like a sledgehammer
You been beating on my mind
You're like a sledgehammer baby
Always hitting from behind
You're like a sledgehammer baby
You been sneakin' all the time, wow
You're like a sledgehammer baby
Always hitting on my mind
You're like a sledgehammer baby
Always hitting on my mind
You're like a sledgehammer baby
Always hitting from behind<start>i know.
i could have been dead.
my nose swelled up to the size of my head.
the fucking gate, man, that shit was half lowered.
i did not see it, so i put my gear in forward.
and the lights that came,
were like a flash of lightning in the pouring rain.
i got up to a stranger's stare.
i touched my finger to my nose to make sure it was still there.
i want the head of septa, to come to my house
and kiss the nose of me 'til it feels better.
i went. no, it didn't make sense.
someone had tampered with the evidence.
so i called the cops, and filled out a report.
oh mr. big butt septa, i will see you in court<start>When I hold you in my arms, I can feel you breathe
When I look into your eyes, makes me believe
In a God, in a place, that brings me hope, gives me faith
Before our time is done, I want to be the one to
[Chorus]
Give you love, give you strength
Get you through your darkest days
When you cry I'll dry the tears for you
Through the years, through the pain
Times of heartache, times of change
I'll be your sun you be my Raine
If I ever let you down, I didn't mean to do that
If you need me and I'm not around, I am sorry for that
Sometimes life is strange, some days it pulls me away from you
But on my soul I swear, for you I will be there to
[Chorus]
You are my flesh, you are my blood
And I will always stand by you, I will
And should the sun go down, give me your hand
I'll pull you through, I will, you know I'll be the one to
[Chorus: x2]<start>Alright, you maggots, get it up
Do you love me, I can't hear you
Pick em up and put em down, you're in the army now
We'll make a man of you and then a soldier too
Shoulders back and stomach in, we'll teach you discipline
Mother's sons and father's daughters, shut it up and follow orders
Study up on weaponry, the M-16 the M-15
Sammy knows the enemy, flim flam big slam
Tell the major what you see, hut, hut, hut, hut
Ayattolah, rock the house, book 'em in with Minnie Mouse
Donald Duck is going red, Goofy's working for the Feds
Eight ball in the side pocket, I just shot my last rocket
I'm coming back, they're on my tail, aren't you glad I escaped from jail
Bangkok rocks, Bangkok rocks, girls on the strip it's a one way trip
Bangkok rocks, Patpong, Patpong, Patpong, Bangkok rocks
Soldiers dine for free Nato's, up a tree tours at nine and three
Go now, pray late,r it's a lay-away plan, free vacation in Iran
Stop and see the middle east miles and miles of lovely beach
Get that copper tone tan on radioactive sand
Those at home just got a directive, all report to the neighborhood
Collective ten hours a day, making makeup
So the girls at the front can be more protected
If I die on the Russian front, bury me with Russian mud
If they drop us in the east, stand up, hook off, off your seat<start>Holy John lives down by the water
Bathing sinners and he wants your daughter
Telling people that they'd better repent
Telling your daughter it was him who was sent
I saw him down there in a long white gown
Taking sinners and holding them down
John, John, won't you wash 'em away
Make us ready for the Judgment Day
Take us down and hold us under
Make the Heavens roar with thunder now
The waters are dirty and the reason is
Holy John had to wash away our sins, yes he did
He came to town two weeks ago
Didn't take long before everyone did know
Down to the riverside they all did flock
To watch him stand upon the rock, yeah
I saw him down there in a long white gown
Taking sinners and holding them down
John, John, won't you wash 'em away
Make us ready for the Judgment Day
Take us down and hold us under
Make the Heavens roar with thunder now
The waters are dirty and the reason is
Holy John had to wash away our sins, oh yes he did<start>[Instrumental]<start>Aaj bhi,

This is the end, my only friend, the end
Of our elaborate plans, the end
Of everything that stands, the end
No safety or surprise, the end
I'll never look into your eyes, again
Can you picture what will be, so limitless and free
Desperately in need, of some, stranger's hand
In a, desperate land
Lost in a Roman wilderness of pain
And all the children are insane, all the children are insane
Waiting for the summer rain, yeah
There's danger on the edge of town
Ride the King's highway, baby
Weird scenes inside the gold mine
Ride the highway west, baby
Ride the snake, ride the snake
To the lake, the ancient lake, baby
The snake is long, seven miles
Ride the snake, he's old, and his skin is cold
The west is the best, the west is the best
Get here, and we'll do the rest
The blue bus is callin' us, the blue bus is callin' us
Driver, where you taken us
The killer awoke before dawn, he put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he walked on down the hall
He went into the room where his sister lived, and, then he
Paid a visit to his brother, and then he
He walked on down the hall, and
And he came to a door, and he looked inside
Father, yes son, I want to kill you
Mother, I want to, fuck you
C'mon baby, take a chance with us
C'mon baby, take a chance with us
C'mon baby, take a chance with us
And meet me at the back of the blue bus
Doin' a blue rock, on a blue bus
Doin' a blue rock, c'mon, yeah
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
This is the end, beautiful friend
This is the end, my only friend, the end
It hurts to set you free
But you'll never follow me
The end of laughter and soft lies
The end of nights we tried to die
This is the end<start>She's downright into herself, it's so untrue
She's dolled right in so well, this can't be you
So come down, so come see
You don't want to wake and believe
You don't know, you don't dream
But somehow you make me so dizzy
I want to stare out your window
You don't want to let me in
Let me in
I want to stare out your window
You don't want to let me in
Let me in
She's calling out to her friend, just give me two
(You don't want to let me in)
She words right under her breath, they don't want you
So come down, so come please
You don't want to make me believe
You don't know, do not tease
But somehow you make me so free
I want to stare out your window
You don't want to let me in
Let me in
I want to stare out your window
You don't want to let me in

So come down, so come please
You don't want to make me believe
You don't know, do not tease

and i can never say exactly what i mean.
you are my Nineveh and i've been Jonah from the start.
and i can't let you make the same mistakes i've made.
if for a moment i could overcome my fear
i wouldn't have to hide behind this fiction wall.
sometimes i wonder how i call myself your friend.
a failure to myself.
a failure to Him.
what if i told you.
would you reach for Him after all.
would you fall down to your knees.
would you walk away from it all.
would you fall down at His feet.
and i watch you live in months between the sun.
i can't help but feel that i wanted more than this.
and still i smile inside and know it's not the end.
because the light of hope is brighter than this wall of silence<start>Well, we bursted out of class
Had to get away from those fools
We learned more from a three-minute record, baby
Than we ever learned in school
Tonight I hear the neighborhood drummer sound
I can feel my heart begin to pound
You say you're tired and you just want to close your eyes
And follow your dreams down
Well, we made a promise we swore we'd always remember
No retreat, baby, no surrender
Like soldiers in the winter's night
With a vow to defend
No retreat, baby, no surrender
Well, now young faces grow sad and old
And hearts of fire grow cold
We swore blood brothers against the wind
Now I'm ready to grow young again
And hear your sister's voice calling us home
Across the open yards
Well maybe we'll cut someplace of our own
With these drums and these guitars
'Cause we made a promise we swore we'd always remember
No retreat, baby, no surrender
Blood brothers in the stormy night
With a vow to defend
No retreat, baby, no surrender
Now on the street tonight the lights grow dim
The walls of my room are closing in
There's a war outside still raging
You say it ain't ours anymore to win
I want to sleep beneath
Peaceful skies in my lover's bed
With a wide open country in my eyes
And these romantic dreams in my head
Once we made a promise we swore we'd always remember
No retreat, baby, no surrender
Blood brothers in a stormy night
With a vow to defend
No retreat, baby, no surrender
No retreat, baby, no surrender
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh<start>Chorus:
You are, You are, You are, You are
You are, You are, You are,
You're God above
(Repeat)
May the world know Your glory
May the world see Your face
Of God above
(Repeat)
May my words be few
Let me sing to You
May my hearts desire
Be what Your heart desires
Chorus
May my words be few
Let me sing to You
May my hearts desire
Be what Your heart desires
May my words be few
May Your heart shine through
May Your will be true
as I live for You

But times they change and so did i
Standing still and getting nowhere quicker
Well it seems I didn't have to try
But now I've found a reason to move on
And you won't miss me much now that I'm gone
You don't seem disappointed
The three years I went to college
Didn't make much of a difference to me
Made me feel so safe I didn't have to think
About the things I really wanna be
So don't get caught up in that trap
They'll make you feel like you've been trapped
Into owing them your gratitude
And all the other platitudes
That make you feel important when you go
But now I've found a reason to move on
And you won't miss me much now that I'm gone
You don't seem disappointed
'cause when you're gone, somebody else will come along and take your place
It doesn't make me feel any less a member of the human race
This ain't no race
Well I'm sorry you're disappointed
But I don't feel that way today
I am free from all the crazy games you played
I am free from all the things you say
And I don't mean to make a mockery of the things
You thought I'd say when I left, but I'm not disappointed
And if I felt the urge to say you're wrong
Well, I just hold the words inside and laugh
And you'd be disappointed
So disappointed
So disappointed<start>From the album sutras

The silence surges softly through me
Listening to the ...desert sigh
In the presence fo the Bo tree

Dreaming as in a trance
Comes the rising of the moon
Weaving...in Maya's dance
The only thing to...really learn
Living in the evernow
To only know the single moment
Living in the evernow
All things...they must pass
That which is born will die
Existence as...transient
Clouds in an autumn sky
Comes the dawning of the day
Dreaming as in a trance
Comes the rising of the sun
Nothing ever left to chance
The only thing to...really learn
Living in the evernow
To only know the single moment

Your thoughts have gone, and you have no control.

Fill your screen.

I don't believe.
Why are you waiting'
Is there something there'
You're still not moving '
Do you care'

nice
But you can walk out of your door and see with your own
eyes.
You can watch the show about the man you wanna be;
Does the things you want to do, and leads you to
believe'
It's better to be watching him,
Than standing on your feet.
Empty pictures

Every day.

Time will heal, the pain won't be so bad.

Dance like a spinnin' top

And dig these rhythm and blues<start>I, I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Oom bop, bop, good vibrations)
She's giving me excitations(Oom bop, bop, excitations)
Good good good good vibrations (Oom bop, bop)
She's giving me excitations(Oom bop, bop, excitations)
Good good good good vibrations (Oom bop, bop)
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop, bop, excitations)
Close my eyes
She's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Oom bop, bop, good vibrations)
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop, bop, excitations)

I don't know where but she sends me there

What's going down
Whatever happened to saturday night
When you dressed up sharp and you felt all right
It don't seem the same since cosmic light
Came into my life, I thought I was divine, wo wo
I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go
And listen to the music on the radio
A saxophone was blowing on a rock'n'roll show
We climbed in the back seat, and really had a good time
Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll
My head was swimming from the perfume I smelled
My hands kind of fumbled with her white plastic belt
I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and that's when I'd melt
She'd whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine
Get back in front, put some hair oil on
Buddy Holly was singing his very last song (bop sho wop)
With your arms around your girl you'd try to sing along (bop sho wop)
It felt pretty good (bop sho wop) because you'd really had a good time
Hot patootie, bless my soul (yeah yeah) I really love that rock and roll (rock and roll)
Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul (I really love) I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll
Hey
Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that
Hot patootie, bless my soul (I really love) I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that (yeah yeah yeah)
Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll (I really love that)
Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and rock and rock and roll
Hot patootie!
Taken From The Album "ANOTHER WORLD" (1998)<start>Music & lyrics: john popper
Barbara, won't you listen for a while
I so honestly, honestly need to smile
I've never felt the need to say goodbye
When you keep someone in your heart
You never leave them behind
Leave it all behind
Is it a home you'll find
Need I dare remind
That home's where you are
Lately I've seen your face, and I'm afraid
I try to sing you your song, but the lyrics they fade
Then I look again, and new words fill my ears
As I see a friend that I love, it calms all my fears
No, I'll shed no tears
Best friends of years and years
And as the bridge soon nears
I'll say home's where you are
Home's where you are
It's in everything you do
Home's where you are
You're gonna find out that it's true
Home's where you are
In every song you play
Home's where you are
Even in what you can't say
Barbara, won't you listen for a while
I so honestly, honestly need to smile<start>I sense there's something in the wind
That feels like tragedy's at hand
And though I'd like to stand by him
Can't shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend
And does he notice my feelings for him?
And will he see how much he means to me?
I think it's not to be
What will become of my dear friend
Where will his actions lead us then?
Although I'd like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic cloud
Try as I may, it doesn't last
And will we ever end up together?
No, I think not, it's never to become
For I am not the one
And will we ever end up together?
Ohhhhhhh<start>Major....
Major barbara sits in the feilds
And waits for her crops to grow
She sits in a chair, that she made outta wood
So many many years ago
Major why won't they grow
You give 'em water and hope
Major why won't they grow
She waits all day,
And hopes through the night
For a new day that might show
A bright yellow sun
That'll make the crops come
And let the old days go
Major why won't they grow
You give 'em water and hope
Major why won't they grow
Major
Look out in your feild
Tell me, what do you see shinin' through?
Major
Look after your fields
And your field will look after you
Yes they do
Yes they do
Yea yea yea
Major why won't they grow
You give 'em water and hope
Major why won't they grow<start>I've got a nightmare to remember, I'll never be the same
What began as laughter so soon would turn to pain
The sky was clear and frigid, the air was thick and still
Now I'm not one to soon forget and I bet I never will
Picture for a moment the perfect irony
A flawless new beginning eclipsed by tragedy
The uninvited stranger started dancing on his own
So we said goodbye to the glowing bride and made our way back home
Life was so simple then
We were so innocent
Father and mother
holding each other
Without warning
Out of nowhere
Like a bullet
From the night
Crushing glass
Rubber and steel
Scorching fire
Glowing lights
Screams of terror
Pain of fear
Sounds of sirens
Smoke in my eyes
Sudden stillness
wrapped in silence
No more screaming
No more cries
Stunned and bewildered
Cold and afraid
Torn up and broken
Frightened and dazed
Stunned and bewildered
Cold and afraid
Torn up and broken
Frightened and dazed
Lying on the table in this unfamiliar place
I'm greeted by a stranger, a man without a face
He said, "Son do you remember? Do you even know your name?"
Then he shined a light into my eyes and said
"Take this for the pain"
Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony
I am endlessly falling, lost in this wonderful misery
In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake
and thought of the panic inside starts to fade
Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony
"Tell me, does this hurt you?" said the faceless man
"Can you move all of your fingers? Can you try your best to stand?"
I asked about the others
"Is everyone okay?"
He told me not to worry as he turned and looked away
Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony
I am endlessly falling, lost in this wonderful misery
In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake
and thought of the panic inside starts to fade
Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony
Day after day and night after night
Replaying the events
Did they ever see the red light?
Over and over, scene by scene
Like a recurring nightmare haunting my dreams
How can you prepare for what would happen next?
No son should ever have to see his father such a mess
It's a miracle he lived, it's a blessing no one died
By the grace of God above, everyone survived
Life was so simple then
We were so innocent
It will stay with us forever
A nightmare to remember<start>Würdsch mi jitz frage wis mir geit

But there are several other very important differences
Between human beings and animals that you should know about
I'd appreciate your input
Sweat baby sweat baby sex is a Texas drought
Me and you do the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about
So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel nuts
Yes I'm Siskel, yes I'm Ebert and you're getting two thumbs up
You've had enough of two-hand touch you want it rough you're out of bounds
I want you smothered want you covered like my Waffle House hashbrowns
Come quicker than FedEx never reach an apex just like Coca-Cola stock you are inclined
To make me rise an hour early just like Daylight Savings Time
Do it now
You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Do it again now
You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Gettin' horny now
Love the kind you clean up with a mop and bucket
Like the lost catacombs of Egypt only God knows where we stuck it
Hieroglyphics? Let me be Pacific I wanna be down in your South Seas
But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean means "Small Craft Advisory"
So if I capsize on your thighs high tide, B-5 you sunk my battleship
Please turn me on I'm Mister Coffee with an automatic drip
So show me yours I'll show you mine "Tool Time" you'll Lovett just like Lyle
And then we'll do it doggy style so we can both watch "X-Files"
Do it now
You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Do it again now
You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Gettin' horny now
You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel

You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals

Gettin' horny now<start>I play a good game But not good as you
I may be a little cold But you can be so cruel
I'm not made of brick I'm not made of stone
But I had you fooled enough to take me on
If love was a war It's you that has won
While I was confessing it You held your tongue
Now the damage is done
There's blood in these veins And I cry when in pain
I'm only human on the inside And though looks may deceive
Make it hard to believe I'm only human on the inside
On the inside
I thought you'd come through I thought you'd come clean
You were the best thing I should never have seen
Cause you go to extremes You push me too far
Then you keep going 'till you break my heart
Yeah you break my heart
See I bleed and I bruise Oh, but what's it to you
I'm only human on the inside
And though looks may deceive Make it hard to believe
I'm only human on the inside
Well I crash and I burn Maybe some day you'll learn
I'm only human on the inside
I stumble, I fall baby under it all
I'm only human on the inside
On the inside
And the damage is done
There's blood in these veins And I cry when in pain
I'm only human on the inside
And though looks may deceive Make it hard to believe
I'm only human on the inside
Well I crash and I burn Maybe some day you'll learn
I'm only human on the inside
I stumble, I fall, baby I do it all
I'm only human on the inside
On the inside On the inside<start>I don't mind this empty room, and I like it when I'm alone,
I'm trying not to think about you, I'm not waiting by the telephone,
I'm watching a late-night movie, where the lovers say goodbye,
And it's really getting to me, and tears are in my eyes,
But I'm not crying, I'm not crying,
I'm not crying over you, I'm over you;
I go out with all of my friends, and I'm hardly ever at home,
You know things just couldn't be better,
I have read it in my horoscope,
I might take a walk past your house, for a trip down memory lane,
You may see me at your window, standing in the pouring rain,
But I'm not crying, I'm not crying,
I'm not crying over you, no I'm not crying,
I'm not crying, I'm not crying, I'm not crying over you,
I'm over you;
No I'm not crying, I'm not crying,
I'm not crying over you, I'm over you,
I'm over you.<start>Sai
Nascono cosÃ¬
Fiabe che vorrei
Dentro tutti I sogni miei
E le racconterÃ²
Per volare in paradisi che non ho
E non Ã¨ facile restare senza piu' fate da rapire
E non Ã¨ facile giocare se tu manchi
Aria come Ã¨ dolce nell'aria
Scivolare via dalla vita mia
Aria respirami il silenzio
Non mi dire addio ma solleva il mondo
SÃ¬
Portami con te
Tra misteri di angeli
E sorrisi demoni
E li trasformerÃ²
In coriandoli di luce tenera
E riuscirÃ² sempre a fuggire dentro colori da scoprire
E riuscirÃ² a sentire ancora quella musica
Aria come Ã¨ dolce nell'aria
Scivolare via dalla vita mia
Aria respirami il silenzio
Non mi dire addio ma solleva il mondo
Aria abbracciami
VolerÃ², volerÃ², volerÃ², volerÃ²
Aria ritornerÃ² nell'aria
Che mi porta via dalla vita mia
Aria mi lascerÃ² nell'aria
Aria com'Ã¨ dolce nell'aria
Scivolare via dalla vita mia
Aria mi lascerÃ² nell'aria<start>Goin down to the drug store
Goin down to the drug store
Goin down down down
Gonna have me some fun
Goin down to the drug store
Gonna buy a box of Romilar
Goin down down down
Gonna have me some fun
I killed my mother and my dad did not approve
I thought they'd always try to tell me what to do
Well I'm a-goin on my world tour
Went down to the drug store
Down down down
Gonna have me some fun
I need a little bit a little more
I need a little bit a little more
Went down to the drug store
Gonna have me some fun<start>I don't know this person in front of me
I knew you one but then you departed
A vicious circle a lashing to your brain
Look at you now you're back where you started
Is this all you ever wanted
Is this all you'll ever be
Cause you'll get none
And you've undone the good you've just done
Why can't you just live without the needs
A muted blur of a life that's shattered
A losing battle this feud within your brain
A perfect life where nothing mattered
Everything turns to grey
You take yourself through the pain
You never ever see the things
Is this all you'll ever be
Everything's a transparency
And you'll get none
You're undone
You're back where you started<start>Pain, it takes so much pain
To help you feel, if you can't feel
At all
Pain, it takes so much pain
To help you feel, if you can't feel
At all
And if you think you need more pain
You can get all that you need
You can get it all for free
Just keep doing what you are
Did somebody tell you that they
Loved you then they said they never
Loved you? How did you feel? How did
You feel?
It doesn't really matter how you felt Ã¢??cause
You can't make them love you, that is for sure
That is for real.
Pain
Do you really think that it won't kill you Ã¢??cause
I know that it will kill you,
Maybe not now, but you'll find out how
Don't tell me that you want to end up just like
Ever other sucker, that would be bad, that would
Be sad.
Now baby please don't misunderstand me
Ã¢??Cause I don't really give a damn
I saw you had a problem and I wanted to help
Ã¢??Cause that's just how I am
It really doesn't matter that much to me
Pain<start>You chase the fire
You paint the signs
I walk the wire
You shout lines
There was a time when my mind
Was made up by you
Is this a deja vu
Am I just missing you?
I've been here before and lived
To the thrill of it all
I might be in the dark
But I'm watching you
You, you chase the fire
But you can't take the heat
You, you slay the lion
And you won't taste the meat
Your look was all it took
To get me hooked on you
My eyes were closed
Now I'm watching you
You, you chase the fire
But you can't take the heat
You, you slay the lion
And you won't taste the meat
I've been here before and we chased
So you chase the fire
You paint the signs
I walk the wire
You shout lines
There was a time when my lines
Were made up by you
Is this a deja vu?
Am I just seeing through
You, you chase the fire
But you can't take the heat
You, you slay the lion
And you won't taste the meat, oh no
I've been here before and lived [incomprehensible]
And you, you chase the fire
You chase the fire
You chase the fire
You paint the signs
I walk the wire
You chase the fire
You paint the signs
I walk the wire
Don't tell me you, you're gonna chase the fire
I've to see that you, when you touch the fire
They say that you, witches don't burn
And you won't take the heat<start>"Well, the doctor comes 'round here with his face all bright
And he says, "In a little while you'll be all right"
All he gives is a humbug pill, a dose of dope and a great big bill
Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?
He says, "Me and my old school pals had some might high times 'round here
And what happened to you poor black folks, well it just ain't fair"
He took a look around, gave a little pep talk, said, "I'm with you" then he took a little walk
Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?
There's bodies floatin' on Canal Street and the levees gone to hell
Martha, get me my sixteen gauge and some dry shells
Them who's got got out of town
And them who ain't got left to drown
Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?<start>I will strike the chord
That's honey to your ears
All that's sweet is yours

Of melodies rehearsed
And all that's sweet is yours

But to you it's a beautiful thing
And here is what I bring
Only downbeats and a string
And to you it's beautiful
I will strike the chord
That's honey to your ears
All that's sweet is yours

Just the third drive by
A light upon my will
Restless soul against the grain
A fresh new head to retain
A king around his land
We're not the same
It's my type of game
You wanna,
You wanna shoot me down
It's my special sound
I ain't fooling around
Don't make a scene
Mercies fall upon the hand
The ranging wolf don't sleep again
I'm breaking backs to stand my ground
Eyes of desperation
Two heads collide begin the falling
Can you believe what's going down?
It's a devil's plain
Won't you turn up my gain?
You wanna shoot me down
It's my special sound
I'm not messing around, no
And the call of these words
Voice be heard
But I'll give to you...
Nothing
It's a devil's plain
Won't you turn up my gain
You know it's all the same
Bring it on back now

Stop messing around

So loose limbed i give in
Although your bed is warm
The worn springs they creak of regret
And lust is the thief who steals away
While we were sleeping
Now you're doing my head in
The lines, the blinds are drawn
We are intimate strangers
I'm reborn, it's a false dawn
Where we've been, i forget
And Saturday's fuss is just small town lust
It's me I'm cheating

Now you're doing my head in<start>I was a teenage anarchist, looking for a revolution.
I had the style, I had the ambition.
I read all the authors, I knew the right slogans.
There was no war but the class war.
I was ready to set the world on fire.
I was a teenage anarchist, looking for a revolution.
Do you remember when you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?
I was a teenage anarchist, but the politics were too convenient.
In the depths of their humanity all I saw was bloodless ideology.
And with freedom as the doctrine, guess who was the new authority?
I was a teenage anarchist, but the politics were too convenient.
Do you remember when you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?
I was a teenage anarchist, but then the scene got too rigid.
It was a mob mentality, they set their rifle sights on me.
Narrow visions of autonomy, you want me to surrender my identity.
I was a teenage anarchist, the revolution was a lie.
Do you remember when you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?
I was a teenage anarchist.<start>De un tiempo perdido, a esta parte esta noche ha venido
un recuerdo encontrado para quedarse conmigo.
De un tiempo lejano, a esta parte ha venido esta noche
otro recuerdo prohibido, olvidado en el olvido.
Sentimentalmente para remediarlo,
voy a quedarme contigo para siempre.
Pero puede que te encuentre Ãºltimamente,
entre tanto me confundo con la gente.
Sentimentalmente nuestro por ahora
es el nido que el olvido ha destruido;
y si el viento me devuelve a tus orillas,
serenamente, serÃ¡ dormido...
Serenamente, serÃ¡ dormido.
De un tiempo lejano a esta parte ha venido perdido,
sin tocarme la puerta, recuerdo entrometido.
De un tiempo olvidado ha venido un recuerdo mojado
de una tarde de lluvia, de tu pelo enredado.
Como siempre que se cambian los papeles
voy a quedarme dormido en tu cintura.
Y si me despierta el dÃ­a presumido,
dÃ©jame quedarme un poco en las alturas.
Para quÃ© contar el tiempo que nos queda,
para quÃ© contar el tiempo que se ha ido,
si vivir es un regalo y un presente

mitad abierto, mitad dormido.<start>I'm so uncertain of what's growing in my head
That's how it goes when there are ghosts to put to bed
What does it want from me
Certificates of certainty

Without you
What would I do
Am I it's brother, it's mother and it's son
Am I the product of everything it's done
Am I a woman 'cause I'm scared to be a man
I'm reaching deep inside with everything I am
One by one the voices make their rounds
I can't believe
The monster I have hidden in my mouth
It has to scream
Oooh what would I do
Without you
What would I do
Oooh what would I do
Without you
What would I do
One by one the voices make their rounds
I can't believe
The monster I have hidden in my mouth
It has to scream
All at once I give into it's sound
Remembering
The monster I have hidden in my mouth
It has to sing
It has to sing
It has to sing
Did I just have to live the chapter on regrets
Should I just tell myself it's easy to forget
I cannot face my pain the same familiar way again
'Cause we are more than who we are
We are
We are
We are
Oooh what would I do
Without you
What would I do
Oooh what would I do
Without you
What would I do
Oooh what would I do<start>Be who you are
Youre a shining star
To be who you are
Youre a shining star
They just dont really know
Some people, dont know how it goes
But you know what you know
Im telling you, to do what you do
Be who you are
Cause youre a shining star
Be who you are
Cause youre a shining star
We all we have a light, within us
Its shining so bright, Im telling you
Some of them know, I know
And some of them dont know where to go, oh but, but
Be who you are
Cause youre a shining star
To be who you are
Youre a shining star
Oh yes, Just be yourself
Dont be nobody else
Love and live your life
And know itll be alright, if you
Be who you are
Cause youre a shining star
And be who you are
Youre a shining star<start>hitler has only one big ball
Gring he has two but small
Himmler has something similar
and poor old Gbbels
has now balls at all.<start>I was all smiles
When I signed on the dotted line
And after these thousands of miles
I don't know what in life is mine
And what's been taking from me
There's so much I could say
But I don't know where to start
Where to start, where to start
I took the bullet and I never thought twice.
I'm always the coolest when there's money in their eyes
Let's burn down this angel town
Let's burn Hollywood to the ground
Cynics all around
They wear masks I wanna see
They make audible sounds
But never say anything
How can I give you my life
If there's nowhere left to go
When it's over I took the bullet, took the heat, I took the fall
I guess I was foolish to believe after all
Let's burn down this angel town
Let's burn Hollywood to the ground
They took all my dreams and all of my things
My family counted on me
And I can't let them down
Let them down
Let's burn Hollywood
'Cause Hollywood, Hollywood lied
Let's burn down this angel town
Let's burn Hollywood to the ground
They took all my dreams and all of my things
My family counted on my
And let everyone down
I let you down
Let's burn down Hollywood
'Cause Hollywood, Hollywood lied<start>[Chorus]
Life is a fear of falling
Life is a fear of falling through
All the cracks
[Verse 1]
Wait around here long enough, you'll see
Another junction, line up and lay down for me
You fall wonderfully
If I question everything you say
Another answer crumbles the birth of my day
It's when you were here
[Pre-Chorus]
You, calling out a name
You, swimming unleashed through a dream
[Chorus]
Life is a fear of falling
Life is a fear of falling through
All the cracks
[Verse 2]
Every siren lost in my lullaby
Every heartbeat functioning thrown to the night
I'm quenched in your light
See the floor rising through a dream
Forgotten thoughts lost in a memorable theme
And soaked to the skin
[Pre-Chorus]
You, calling out a name
You, swimming unleashed through a dream
[Chorus]
Life is a fear of falling
Life is a fear of falling through
All the cracks
[Bridge]
And I wanted to tell you that
And I wanted to tell you that
[Pre-Chorus]
You, calling out a name, oh
You, swimming unleashed through a dream
[Chorus]
Life is a fear of falling
Life is a fear of falling through
All the cracks
[Chorus]
Life is a fear of falling
Life is a fear of falling through
All the cracks<start>Baby those brown eyes
Well they snuck right up on me
Took me by surprise
Didn't know how deep they'd be
Been a long time comin'
Since somebody made me look
And stop all this runnin'
I guess you had what it took
And it's feelin' good tonight
So I'm gonna hold on tight
We can take it slow
Baby come what may
We'll just let love lead the way
I know you're just like me
You've always been in control
You'll give your time but
You won't ever bare your soul
But baby don't worry
If you need to back away
You can be sure we
Won't make any rules to how we play
But it's feelin' good tonight
So I'm gonna let it ride
We can take it slow
Baby come what may
We'll just let love lead the way
Hey I know it's overused
but we ain't got a thing to lose
We can dance all night while the music plays
We'll just let love lead the way
Yeah it's feelin' good tonight
Don't you wanna hold on tight
We can take it slow
Baby come what may
We'll just let love lead the way
And I know it's overused
But we ain't got a thing to lose
We can dance all night while the music plays
And we'll let love lead the way
Let it lead the way<start>I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by, dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a new born baby it just happens every day
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door and it has been painted black
Maybe then I?ll fade away and not have to face the facts
It?s not easy facin? up when your whole world is black
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the settin? sun
My love will laugh with me before the mornin? comes
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
I wanna see it painted, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black, yeah<start>Well, I've been thinking lately much of my baby
Thinking how she needs me, yeah
And I don't see you know if she's feeling so bad
Feeling so bad, feeling so bad
Maybe it?s better
If I forget her
Let her go on
How I long to hold her tenderly
How I long to hold her close to me
Maybe someday she will change her mind
And let me taste her lips of wine
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the morning
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the evening
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the morning
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine
Maybe it?s better if
I forget her
Let her go on
How I long to her hold her tenderly
How I long to hold her close to me
Maybe someday she will change her mind
And let me taste her lips of wine
Lips of wine, woah, woah

It don't look like a good thing
Your horse could jump it when the pack runs wild
It don't look like a sure thing
You must be crazy
To gamble this way
The kids are crying
And your bills ain't paid
Gamblin' man, ramblin' fool
I must be crazy to gamble on you
The deal is done so you slip right in
You got the depth but you can't win
The cards are cold and the cut feels thin
You got the deck but you can't win
You must be crazy
To gamble this way
The kids are hungry
And your brain ain't paid
Gamblin' man, ramblin' fool
I must be crazy to gamble on you
Gamblin' man, you're a ramblin' fool

And when I'm away from you I love how you miss me
I love the way you always treat me tenderly
But, darling, most of all I love how you love me

I love how your heart beats whenever I hold you
I love how you think of me without being told to
I love the way your touch is always heavenly
But, darling, most of all I love how you love me
(Love how you love me)
I love how your eyes close whenever you kiss me
And when I'm away from you I love how you miss me
I love the way your touch is always heavenly
But, darling, most of all I love how you love me

Look at me, I'm made up of lights
Look at me, I am really a sight
A sight to behold
To hold with your eyes
Look at me, I can move like you
Look at me, I can zoom in on you
Look at me, I can, and scream
I can make you laugh, I can make you scream
3-d, the more you look
The more you'll see
3-d, the more you
The closer I'll see you
Look at me, I'm out of control
Look at me
You can look down my throat
Look at me, but can't out just me
I'm mind, I'm matter on the video screen
Look at me, ooh, the reds and greens
Look at me, all the colors so real
Look at me, I'll make you laugh
And I'll make you scream
I'm mind, I'm matter on the video screen

What do you want
I'm givin' everything I have
I'm even trying to see if there's more
Locked deep inside
I'll try
I'll try
Can't you see, this is me
What do you need
What do you need
Is someone just to hurt
So that you can appear to be smart
Keep a steady job
Play God
Play God
What to you really know
You parasite
You're dynamite
An oversight
Misunderstanding what you hear
You're quick to cheer
And volunteer
Absurdities, musical blasphemies
Oh Lord
Save us all
What do you want
What do you want
I'm givin' every thing I have
I'm even trying to see if there's more
Locked deep inside
I'll try
I'll try
Can't you see, this is me<start>I could do the dishes while talking on the phone
I could ask you for an answer but you want to be alone
I can never do the dishes a single dish at a time
It's too much of a commitment so I close my eyes and fire
I could calamine your insides
I could wind them all around me I could
Tiptoe on a tightrope made of fear and looking down see
All the people do they see me I can wave or
I can carry all the silverware I'm holding that is
Keeping me steady
Or I could go to Australia
And carry a bowie knife
And wear my hair like Hepburn parted on the side
And learn card tricks and buy
Everyone drinks and take boxing and write
Songs about my bowie knife
I could do these dishes I could try
To do these dishes
Time to decide
I could make a cake
My kitchen is small but I could clear the space
I could write my name
'Cause practice makes perfect yes that's what they say
I could rearrange my room and draw a bath and wash my wolf suit
I could make a button out of plaster
That said finished I could nail it in my closet
To the right side of the light switch
I could walk down to a restaurant and try drinking to forget it
But then come home less afraid and then press it and press it
Or I could go to Australia
Carry a bowie knife
And wear my hair like Hepburn parted on the side
And learn card tricks and buy
Everyone drinks and take boxing and try
Eating things only with chopsticks and write
Songs about my bowie knife
I could do these dishes I could try
To do these dishes
I could try to do these dishes
Time to decide
Or I could go to Australia
And carry a bowie knife
And wear my hair like Hepburn parted on the side
And learn card tricks and physics and buy
Everyone drinks and take boxing and try
Eating things only with chopsticks and finally
Be like a person I think you'd like
I could do these dishes I could try
To do these dishes I could try to do these dishes
Time to decide to do these dishes
Time to DECIDE'.
Fuck it
I'm gonna go to Australia
I'm gonna go to Australia
I'm gonna go to Australia
Bye-bye<start>Everything I did
I did for you
I have put away my pride for you
Taking all the hardest roads I knew
Cause' I got you on my mind
You were never there
To touch my love
It was never ever clear
What you thought about
But I can never live without you love
Cause' I got you on my mind
I'm gonna break this
I'm gonna burn it to the ground
I'm gonna break this
I'm gonna burn it to the ground
Whoa!
To the Ground!
Yeah!
Automatic thoughts take over now
They are forcing me to walk through fires now
Have you been lying all this time till now?
I can't get you of my mind
There is only you
No one above
There'll never ever
Be another you, my love
All my soul is aching for you love
I can't get you of my mind
I'm gonna break this
I'm gonna burn it to the ground
I'm gonna break this
I'm gonna burn it to the ground
Whoa!
To the Ground!
Yeah!
There's a hole in my heart
A hole in my soul
A hole in my world
I can never let go
Have you been?
Have you been?
Have you been faithful?
There's a hole in my heart
A hole in my soul
There's a hole in my world
I can never let go
Have you been?

Got to be the last of a long lost tribe

Ain't no bright lights shining
Ain't no bad moon rising at all
Ya got me rolling through the tumbleweed
This wild child's all I need
Well I got her
And she's all mine
There ain't nothing like
A little midnight stroll
And make a little love
Where the buffalo roam
I ain't no Geronimo
But I had a good time
I walk her to her tee pee
And I kissed her goodnight
Ain't no bright lights shining
Ain't no bad moon rising at all

Or looking for handouts why don't you go find a job
You birth more kids to up your checks
So you can buy more drugs cash in food stamps and get drunk
Uncle Sam takes half my pay
So you can live for free
I got a family and bills to pay
No one hands money to me
You can go to school for nothing
Got that government grant get money in advance
When you're sick from shooting up
Medicaid pays full portion
When little Maria gets knocked up
She gets a free abortion
Uncle Sam takes half my pay
So you can live for free
I got a family and bills to pay
No one hands money to me
You can go to school for nothing
Got that government grant get money in advance
When you're sick from shooting up
Medicaid pays full portion
When little Maria gets knocked up
She gets a free abortion
How come it's minorities who cry
Things are too tough
On TV with their gold chains
Claim they don't have enough
I say make them clean the sewers
Don't take no resistance
If they don't like it go to hell
And cut their public assistance<start>I see you down in the back of the bar.
Accompanied and comforted, by what you are.
And there's a place in the back of your mind
And you'd give anything to leave it behind
Cause it's where you reside.
And I watch you stir around 'cause it keeps me busy.
Always willing to take the time so it won't just waste away.
And it's tearing you apart, I watch the pieces scatter
Pick one up and look around for another souvenir.
I've been trying to pin you down
Your bound to spot something that I shouldn't see.
I've got a private view of this, and this I've seen before
And wouldn't miss, 'Cause it's something to do
And I watch you stir around 'cause it keeps me busy.
Always willing to take the time 'cause it tends to waste away.
And it's tearing you apart, let's watch the pieces scatter.
I'll pick one up and look around, maybe I'll meet you down...
Yeah we watch you stir around and it keeps us busy.
Always willing to take the time so it won't just waste away.
And it's tearing you apart, we'll watch the peices scatter.
Pick one up and poke around for another souvenir.
Yeah we watch you stir around and it keeps us busy.
Always willing to take the time 'cause it tends to waste away.
And it's tearing you apart, watch the peices scatter.
Pick one up and look around for another souvenir.
I see you down in the back of the bar, accompanied and comforted.

It's never enough

But I don't tend to worry 'bout the things that other people say
And I'm learning that I wouldn't want it any other way
Call me crazy but it really doesn't matter
All that matters to me is she
Her life in a nutshell
No way would she want it to change me
It's not that easy 'cause
My time is often decided for me
For me
She memorized every pencil crayon color in the box
Her blue-green eyes complement the burnt sienna in her locks
She's at the movies, I'm on the phone;
When we're separated, we're never alone, but still
It's never enough, It's never enough,
No it's never enough
[Chorus]
Her life in a nutshell
No way would she want it to change me
It's not that easy 'cause
My time is often decided for me
For me
I fell down with no one there to catch me from falling
Then she came 'round
And only her tenderness stopped me from bawling my eyes out
I'm OK, and that's why
Her life in a nutshell
No way would she want it to change me
It's not that easy 'cause
My time is often decided for me
For me

Oh...<start>Cold fire, you've got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace, child
I moved up to take a place
Near you
So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tried
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heat
In pieces
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past?
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star
One day, though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past?
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star
One day, though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star<start>You catch his eye
From across the room, you catch his eye
You think, "Oh my,
He's got quite the beard, oh my"
And now you wonder but you can't look away
His beard is black and bushy with a hint of grey
And now you find yourself walking his way, hey, hey
You should consider having sex with a bearded man!
You're getting this feelings that you can't understand
Sex with a bearded man!
You think you can't but you can
Don't try to fight, just get freaky with a beard tonight
Don't be scared
His beard is soft to the touch, don't be scared
You get some hair
In your mouth, when you kiss him, you get some hair
You've never been with a man like him before
But each time you looked at that beard, you wanted more
And now he's asking you, "My place or yours?", good lord
You are about to have sex with a bearded man!
He rubs his bristles on your mammary glands
Sex with a bearded man!
This wasn't part of the plan
Don't try to fight just get freaky with a beard tonight
Ooooooooh, Ooooooooh
And now you grab him by his facial hair
He's got some food stuck in his beard, but you don't care
You say, "Rub that beard on me, everywhere!"
Now it appears you're having sex with a bearded man!
His sweaty beard drips like a watering can
Sex with a bearded man!
Just take your life in your hands
And ride that bearded man
Sex with a bearded man
Ooooooooh, sex with a bearded man, Ooooooooh
And he'll leave you with a glint in your eye
A bit of loose beard hair on your bedside
And some pash-rash between your thighs, oh my
Congratulations, you had sex with a bearded man<start>You almost know we suffer from the same desire you now can understand
didn't stop to think again you moved I ran an open wound we must
conclude I know a man who only cries an old desire (he is just a man)
this is for me and I know everyone knows this is for you and I
know it really shows but noone talks nothing looks noone fears only
fear and soon will too engage but in my eyes it's almost lost<start>I push the limits of good taste
Whenever I open my mouth
You got a worm in your ear
Like Chekou from Kahn
Shame! Shame
I hit a new kind of low
Shame! shame
I hit a new kind of low
All the way from South Dakota
I like a green leprechaun
She got a sun dress in heat
He got his latex gloves on
Shame! Shame
I hit a new kind of low
Shame! Shame
I hit a new kind of low
Shame! Shame
I hit a new kind of low
Shame! Shame
I hit a new kind of low
And if you ever come here
You're tweaking on the phone
I got a new connection
I never leave the light on
Shame! Shame
I hit a new kind of low
Shame! Shame
I hit a new kind of low
Shame! Shame
I hit a new kind of low
Shame! Shame
I hit a new kind of low
All the time a loss
Black like you were blessed
I was sobered blind
Let you take me there
And laughed loud when you found
I was devoured, devoured
Devoured, devoured, devoured
Devoured, devoured, devoured
Devoured<start>No rose will ever seem as red
No sky will seem as blue
As when you fall in Love
For the first time
No song will sound as sweet
No love will sweep you off your feet
As when you fall in love for the first time
And you were the first time
I gave my heart away
Blind to the price I'd have to pay
And now that you're gone
I've nothing left to give
I gave it all away the first time
No tear will ever fall as fast
As they fall for the love you thought would last
Nothing hurts like the love
You loose the first time
I'll play the game of love again
I'll learn to lie and I'll pretend
That it tastes just as sweet
As the first time
And you were the first time I gave my heart away
Blind to the price that I'd have to pay
And now that you're gone, I've got nothing left to give
I gave it all away
The first time<start>Giovane teologo non fare
come in rue de Fouarre
dove si produceva amore,
si produceva per Dio
e arnesi per dimostrarne l'esistenza, che,
gi mostrava la sola competenza.
Lessing diciassettenne
arriva a Lipsia
per fare teologia.
Apprende prima la scherma e la danza.
La distinzione
e la lontananza.
Camice, prego!
Il teologo si prepari
agli atti della sua professione.
Ecco, no guardate
un po' pi sotto,
qui vedrete esattamente com' fatto Dio.
L'attributo "buono"
delimita uno spazio,
segna una distanza.
Il paziente non pu aspettare.
Si proceda a regolare
dissezione.
Camice, prego!
Signori, anatomia!
Presto, bisturi. Klemmen her!
Signori teologi basta, ricucite.
Ancora una cosa,
mente a Ockam prego:
Dio differisce dalla pietra
perch questa, dice, finita.
La teologia vi invita,
anzi vi impone di,
immaginare
una pietra infinita.
Camice, prego.<start>One song on the edge of my lips
One back pocket where my fingers fit
One sun in my blue sky
One name that my sharpie writes
Seems like I get so single minded
Tunnel vision blinded by
You
Oh
Cause baby I love
You
Oh
Two thoughts running through my head
What weve done and aint done yet
One number on my speed dial
One hello that makes me smile
I got no reason to be calling
Except for baby I love talking to
You
Oh
Cause baby I love
You
Oh
All I think and dream about
Oh baby is
You
Oh
And the best part
Is when Im in your arms
And youre whispering
Baby, I love you
I got one plan and no plan B
Once in ???? I see
One lover and one best friend
A million tomorrows I want to spend with
You
Oh
Cause baby I love
You
Oh
Well all I think and dream about
My baby is
You
Cause baby I love
You
Oh
Im crazy over
You
Cause baby I love
You
Just so in love with
You<start>In me, you see a man alone
Drinking up sunshine, and thinking it's his own
A man who listens to the trembling of the leaves
With sentimental ease
Easy to be a man alone
Just make the whole wide world your only home
Don't talk to strangers, some will not be kind
And muddle up your mind
Alone, not lonely
Except when the dark comes on
I'm a man learning to live with
Memories of midnights that fell apart at dawn
In me you see, a man alone
Drinking up Sundays and spending them alone
Man who still goes walking, walking in the rain
Expecting love again
Alone not lonely
Except when the dark comes on
I'm a man learning to live with
Memories of midnights that fell apart at dawn
Easy to be a man alone
Just make the whole wide world your only home
Don't talk to strangers, some will not be kind
And muddle up your mind<start>Summer is coming
And I hope I feel better by the time it does
Then I could leave my room my cocoon
Find the door and walk out to the sun
Feel like I've moved on
Lessons learnt my mind is feeling calm and so reassured
Yeah things are on the up
I'm on top of the situation I've endured
Took my time to come around
From the day that I was shot down
Oh now I know that
I confused myself with somebody else
I didn't know what to do, 'cause I was somebody new
Oh now I know that
I confused myself with somebody else
I didn't know what to do, know what to do
A Silhouette in the shadows
I drank too much and darkness settled in and drew in me
And oh my bleeding heart did start to repair
And I could clearly see
Open the windows
Serotonin and the vitamins see D and E
Oh let it all sink in to your skin close your eyes
And you can feel the release
Took my time to come around
From the day that I was shot down
Oh now I know that
I confused myself with somebody else
I didn't know what to do, 'cause I was somebody new
Oh now I know that
I confused myself with somebody else
I didn't know what to do, know what to do
Summer is coming
And I hope I feel better by the time it does
Then I could leave my room
And walk out to the sun
I confused myself with somebody else
I didn't know what to do, 'cause I was somebody new
Oh now I know that
I confused myself with somebody else
I didn't know what to do, know what to do
Tried so many ways to come through for you
Tried to get it right and really improve
And yeah I really wanted to
Took my time to come around
Breathing in and breathing out
Won't you see what I can do
When I leave my room<start>[Originally by The Business]
But for you where would they be
In a society claiming democracy
Nothing in the press or the radio

And everything is quiet now
Feeling is gone
And the picture disappears
everything is cold now
The dream had to end
The wish never came true
And the girl
Starts to sing
Seventeen seconds
A measure of life<start>How can you think you have the right in using her
Without consent?
Does stating this surprise you?
Did you think about the consequences?
Mentality, it is low, it is low.
One thing he knows for sure
She hits the floor again.
Seemed like a good idea, date a fellow student in his class
Thought he'd be cool and not cold
He pinned her on the floor
The rest is left unsaid
In fear she keeps it inside, disturbed by his gross act
No pride
Isolate me I can't hide
Erase his being in mind.<start>Not sure what tomorrow brings
Not sure why a caged bird sings
Don't ask 'cause I don't know
No idea just where to go
High hopes and higher dreams
May not have everything
I promise to be good
I'll be good for you
Hard work and harder times
As long as you say you are mine
We'll see the other side together
It's not losing it all
If we have each other
In the end it's all
In the end it's all that matters
If we take this chance
And it falls to pieces
In the end you're all
In the end you're all that matters
My my, oh no
Don't have much money to show
Don't care, don't cry
Wipe that mascara from your eyes
I know you'll see
We've just got to believe
In you, in me
We make our own destiny
It's not losing it all
If we have each other
In the end it's all
In the end it's all that matters
If we take this chance
And it falls to pieces
In the end you're all
In the end you're all that matters
How could I
Say goodbye?
We've come too far to turn back now
Who are we
Without each other?
Too entwined to untangle now
It's not losing it all
If we have each other
In the end it's all
In the end it's all that matters
If we take this chance
And it falls to pieces
In the end you're all
In the end you're all that matters

There's songs and poems and promises and dreams that might come true
But I won't talk of starry skies or moonlight on the ground

Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Oh darlin' how I'd love to lay you down
There's so many ways your sweet love made this house into a home
You've got a way of doing little things that turn me on
Like standing in the kitchen in your faded cotton gown
With your hair still up in curlers I still love to lay you down
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Oh darlin' how I'd love to lay you down
When a whole lot of Decembers are showin' in your face
Your auburn hair has faded and silver takes it's place
You'll be just as lovely and I'll still be around
And if I can I know that I'd still love to lay you down
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Oh darlin' how I'd love to lay you down
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear

Who's gonna save us from this lonely picket line,
10 years of service but I'm still not worth your time.
And I've seen men give their lives,
And heard the stories that they tell of how they labored
For this company which sold it's soul to hell

And thoughts I have of better days for families such as mine.
Because if history repeats itself and time will surely tell.

Yes sand is empty
In the hourglass
I'll be there
To turn it over and over
In your head
So you keep the hope
You get your day yeah oh
As the slow hand quickens
Oh you see
Too hard to break
Too cold to burn
Afraid your chance is gone
The wires are crossed
Your mouth is lost
You fear you've left it far too long
The minutes pass
The hours are gone
So hard to find your way alone
As the slow hands quicken
The slow hands quicken
These slow hands quicken<start>Instrumental<start>I left our hometown for the weekend on a big business deal
And I would close behind you my excuse is sharp and drill
My only business is our pleasure and I don't bother things I won't
Cause we're playing house away from home
We're playing house away from home our names and faces are unknown
Everyone thinks that we're man and wife
We even wear our wedding rings and we don't try to hide this thing
Cause we're playing house away from home
[ steel ]
We'll get up in the morning I'll go my way and I'll go mine
And go home to act like strangers and hope no one can tell
That we have left all the bills from actin' right and doin' wrong
Cause we're playing house away from home
We're playing house...
Yes we're playing house away from home<start>1. I thought I knew the Story. I thought I'd seen it all
Those days of love and glory. But now I hear you call
Chourus:
Calley Oh
See there's nowhere to hide
Calley Oh
I can feel you inside
Don't you know
That I can't hold back
I keep on coming after you
2. You never compromise me. You never find it hard
You never recognize me. You throw me off my guard
Ch: Calley Oh
With the roads that you pave
Calley Oh
You can have it your way
Don't you know
That I can't hold back
I keep on coming after you
Bridge:
I go chasing moonshine racing you may wonder why
If I find my true love ever
I will never
I will never say good bye
3. I'm past the point of caring. It's just your point of view
I'm Past the point of sharing. I gave it all to you
Ch: Calley Oh
You can see through my eyes
Calley Oh
You could never disguise
What you know Ã¢?Â¦ That I can't hold back
I keep on coming after you
Calley Oh
You're my nights and my days
Calley Oh
Finding my way
Don't You know that I can't hold back
I keep on coming after you.<start>I've tried every conceivable pill
To stop me from getting so ill
But when the ship starts to rock n roll
I've got to reach for me medical bowl
And it would take a magical potion
To carry me across the Atlantic ocean
It's no good you saying it's quicker by air
I'd be very much sicker if I went up there.
I'd like to see America
The President and his Cadillac car.
Everything's fine in America
But I don't think that I'll get that far
'Cause it would take a magical potion
To carry me across the Atlantic ocean
No good you saying it's quicker by air
I'd be sicker if I went up there.
Everything in America's fine
The Coca Cola and the Neon sign
Broadway is the place for me
Though it's a place that I'll never be
I'd like to go to California
Put some flowers in my hair
I'd like to go to Hollywood
See the film-stars if I only could
But it would take a magical potion
To carry me across the Atlantic ocean
No good you saying it's quicker by air
I know I'd be sicker if I went up there.<start>Oh just let me hold you baby
I'm trying to forget about the past
Yes, let me hold you baby
I'm trying to forget about the past
Yes, I know you've had a hard time baby
But remember troubles don't always last
Oh you tried so hard to tell me you love me
And I didn't believe a word you said
You tried so hard to tell me you love me, woman
And I didn't believe a word you said
But now I'm older and I'm wiser, baby
And now I can understand your ways
Oh, I'm at your mercy, woman
Do with me what you will to me
Yes I'm at your mercy, baby
Just do with me what you will to me
Yes I'm not asking for sympathy baby
Yes I was wrong and I must pay
Oh, I'm asking for just one more chance
Baby, to try to prove my love to you
Well, I'm asking you for just one more chance
Baby, to try to prove my love to you
You just say the word now baby
And I'll do anything you tell me to<start>Si no estÃ¡s atento

You walk up to me and say,
I feel like I know you baby
And then take a sip of your cherry coke,
Now, now who drinks a cherry coke
Maybe you notice
I see that bead of sweat dancing on your cheek
Your words are like a cheap champagne,
I get the point, but it's much too sweet
I'm so tired of the dance,
This carousel of superficial conversation
Gets me nowhere
So you can see my bra, underneath my shirt,
Watch the wind, underneath my skirt,
But that ain't the picture it's just a part,
Everybody's got a story that could break your heart.
See my eyes, don't see what I see.
Touch my tongue, don't know what tastes good to me.
It's the human condition that keeps up apart,
Everybody's got a story that could break your heart.
Yea everybody's got a story that could break your heart.
La la la la la la na na na na na na na
Now who can read the mind of the red-headed girl next door,
Or the taxi driver who just dropped you off,
Or the, or the classmate that you ignore.
Don't assume everything on the surface is what you see,
'Cause that classmate just lost her mother,
And that taxi driver's got a Ph-d.
I'm so tired of the fear
That weighs us down with wrong assumptions
A broken heart's a natural function
So you can see my bra, underneath my shirt,
Watch the wind, underneath my skirt,
But that ain't the picture it's just a part,
Everybody's got a story that could break your heart.
See my eyes, don't see what I see.
Touch my tongue, don't know what tastes good to me.

Everybody's got a story that could break your heart.

So dig deep, (dig deep)
Deeper than the image that you see, (dig deep)
Lift up, feel, and let your true self breathe, (dig deep)
Show the world the beauty of belief (belief)

Don't ask me why, it's just the nature of my groove.
I larged down the boulevard, came under attack,
But I rocked them senseless, 'cause honey it's tight like that.
I hung a left down to Lemans' Avenue,
Stagger Lees everywhere, trying to bring me doom, oh no.
And that Old Scratch, he tried to purchase this soul,
That don't confront me, 'cause I'm never in the need of a payroll.
Heck, yeah.
Amen, do it all again.
Rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham.
Spit shine and a three piece suit,

Hallelujah, all the people in the back.
Hallelujah, it's tight like that.
Hallelujah, all the people up front.
Tight like that, rapture, rock.
And all you know-it-alls with politic views.
Ideals don't situate themselves in His groove.
So if you want to know, you just got to ask.
But if you don't lose that skin, you'll never be tight like that.
Watch me work, yeah.
Amen, do it all again.

You ain't alone in this ugly town
You stick a needle in your arm
You bite the dust, you buy the farm

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid

Get your foot out of that grave
Don't let that one love tear your world apart
C'mon babe, kick that stuff
Show the street it ain't so tough
Quit lyin' around with a crippled, broken heart
Now I know you've been seeing red
Don't put a pistol to your head
Sometimes your answer's heaven sent
Your way is so damn permanent
Now I know you've been kicked around
You ain't alone in this ugly town
You stick a needle in your arm
You bite the dust, you buy the farm

A spot is worn from hours and hours upon my knees
I step inside
The quiet's like a doorway to a world of peace
One thing I don't worry 'bout
I can't wear my welcome out
I keep knock, knock,
Knockin' on Heaven's door
I keep talk, talk
Talkin' 'cause You answer Lord
Won't be stop, stop
Stoppin' so be listening for me
I'm know, knock
Knock'n on Heaven's door
I'm not a poet
No, it's not like me to speak in flowery words
Not a prophet
Not at least in these parts
That would be unheard of
But my heart speaks loud and clear
And since my prayers are answered here
Whisper what you're feeling
Shout it at the ceiling
Nothing's gonna fall on deaf ears
Ask Him for His mercy
Pray away your worries
What do you want Heaven to hear
Bless the world around you
Pray His peace surround you
Thank Him for His favor
Simply praise the Saviour<start>Will it really help me to learn
About Frederick The Great and when Rome burned?
Wish they'd skip over me when it's my turn

So I can talk way above my station

Well, hooray, hooray for Tom
Won the spelling bee
Spelled the difficult words so right
And now he's on TV
Oh, hooray, hooray for Tom
He's up there for all to see
And I hope someday they'll say hooray for me
Teach me long division
So I can figure out baseball stats
Batting average, fielding percentage and all that
Well I learned more at home okay
Learned how to scrap, learned some funny things to say
And I lost when I spelled be A-N-A-N-A-N-A
Well, hooray, hooray for Tom
Won the spelling bee
Spelled the difficult words so right
And now he's on TV
Hooray, hooray for Tom

Won the old spelling bee
Spelled the difficult words so right
Spelled the crepuscule so right

Silent town,
Ghosts this empty street.
I see the home that once was mine,
Now just bones of former life.
Touch this page of sacred time, again,
I see you call
You don't have to be strong for me.
I won't shoot your defenses down.
Whatever happens, I want you to see
We can face it together.
And turn it around.
A new life
Grows within his hands.
Coming back
To this promised land.
And with these bones we will rebuild,
To the flesh of future life.
Giving back that sacred time, again
You don't have to be strong for me.
I won't shoot your defenses down.
Whatever happens, I want you to see,
We can face it together.
And turn it around.<start>Oh, oh, oh
Why would you pay to see me in a cage?
And why would you pay to see me in a cage?
Some men call the stage
Listen now I have gone
You will know
I was the only one that would have died
What was wrong in the eyes of the unwell and unwise
And I killed a man for his giro today
Wasn't very gay, I didn't mind
I was a money man anyway
Killed a man for his giro today
Why, would you pay
Why, would you pay
To see me in a cage
It's all across the stage
And know
When the night has come
You might say
I was not the only the one who would've died
What was wrong in the eyes of the cruel and unwise
And I killed a man for his giro today
On the off chance that you're listening '
To the radio
I thought you might like to know you broke my heart
Can only sadden up or hedge your bets
Or take a chance and never get you again
All my ties, time and time
I keep on trying hard not to try too hard
When I forgive, I won't forget
To killing time, so I'm better now
I don't need it...
Anything that makes you, feel hate
Can do without hate
Now I believe in love
Now I have gone
Oh yeah, I will pay
For everything you've done
What was wrong
In the eyes of the unwell and unwise
And I killed a man for his giro today

Hello Detroit auto workers, let me thank you for your time.
You work a forty hour week for a livin', just to send it on down the line.
Hello Pittsburgh steel mill workers, let me thank you for your time.
You work a forty hour week for a livin', just to send it on down the line.
This is for the one who swings the hammer, driving home the nail.
Or the one behind the counter, ringing up the sale.
Or the one who fights the fires, the one who brings the mail.
For everyone who works behind the scenes.
You can see them every morning in the factories and the fields.
In the city streets and the quiet country towns.
Working together like spokes inside a wheel.
They keep this country turning around.
Hello Kansas wheat field farmer, let me thank you for your time.
You work a forty hour week for a livin', just to send it on down the line.
Hello West Virginia coal miner, let me thank you for your time.
You work a forty hour week for a livin', just to send it on down the line.
This one is for the one who drives the big rig, up and down the road.
Or the one out in the warehouse, bringing in the load.
Or the waitress, the mechanic, the policeman on patrol.
For everyone who works behind the scenes.
With a spirit you can't replace with no machine.

Just a real good time
And I don't want to seem to be mistaken
But there's a tale to tell
On this road to hell
It's in between the lines the case I'm making
Oh, lord, look my way
Save me from these crazy things I see
I don't know what's going on round here these days
But I can't dance to that
Oh, I can't dance to that
So let me dance to this
'cause I can't dance to that
If you'll excuse me please
You see I got to go
And take myself before I'm past redemption
A voice is calling out
As if I didn't know
This wretched road is paved with good intentions
All the way
Down this Judas track
I know it so well
And I ain't going back
I don't know what happened to the good time songs
But I can't dance to that
Oh, I can't dance to that
So let me dance to this
'cause I can't dance to that
Tell me what you know
Take away these chains
What stood in front of me it looks so pretty
But I can't dance to a cold machine
Oh, lord, and every drummer you know just what I mean
Oh, I can't dance to that
So let me dance to this<start>hey tess i've told you this a million times before when i can't find the keys and i can't find the door anymore
your dress is all wet from the raining outside, you've run from him again, you can't find a place to hide
let's stay up all night and confess to the stars of all the secrets that you tell me and how you've run too far
sometimes it's better to just sit and smile as our life, it passes us by
sometimes it's better to just sit and stare as our life, it's passing us by
don't feel alarmed and tess don't be afraid of all the people you surround yourself with, they're all insane
and don't be around when the clock strikes twelve even if i call you out, even if i call your name
sometimes it's better to just sit and smile as our life it's passes us by
sometimes it's better to just sit and stare as our life, it's passing us by
it's passing us by, you and me.
i can't find the sea when the fog's on haight
i can't find you anywhere this lonely heart
don't be around when the clock strikes twelve
even if i call you out, even if i call your name
if i call you out, if i call your name<start>She was still on my mind when I crossed the state line
Walked out a little too fast
I said some things that I didn't mean
And I should have taken 'em back
And I knew when I said 'em that voice in my head whispered
Man when are you gonna learn
You told her goodbye you left with your pride
But you're gonna eat those words
[Chorus]
And now I'm havin' breakfast in Birmingham
Tryin' to swallow my pride
I got a plate full of memories
And not much appetite
There ain't nothin' like a cold cup of coffee and a stale apology
I'm having breakfast in Birmingham
She's in Tennessee
It's a thunderin' sound silver droppin' down
In an ol' pay phone
When you're makin' that call to say you were wrong
And it's ringin' like nobody's home
She's not the kind who'll cry and remind me
That I left and broke her heart
I'm prayin' she answer 'cause I gotta tell her
This time I went too far
[Chorus]<start>please, please don't disappear
i'm clearly unprepared and aloof
and trained to walk without
though i can trace the steps we've made clearly
so what is real?
we either break it or stay concealed
don't lack incentive
don't let me crowd your space
if you'll do the same i'll slow to match your pace
please don't disappear
i know in absense perspectives clear, but don't move
feel safe to think out loud
and i'll do the same when passing town through town
so what is real?
we either break it or stay concealed
don't lack incentive
don't let me crowd your space
if you'll do the same i'll slow to match your lead
match your lead
please, please don't disappear
i'm clearly unprepared and aloof
and far behind in count
though i can trace the steps we've made clearly<start>Staring at Paper faces,
Expressions like empty pages,
Day after day
Waiting for the lights to change now,
Reaching for a cloud to come down,
And cover me
Can't shut you out
Can't get you out
Can't take you down
Can't watch you drown
Waiting for the world to change,
Dissolution takes a bit off,
And swallows me
Looking for a way to get out,
Wishing that the rush would come down
And smother me
Can't shut you out
Can't get you out
Can't take you down
Can't watch you drown
If you can learn to be yourself,
Then that's okay
If you can find a reason now,
Don't drift away
Walking down streets to nowhere,
Stepping on feet with no cares,
Losing my self
Can't shut you out
Can't get you out
Can't take you down
Can't watch you drown
Can't shut you out
Can't get you out
Can't take you down
Can't watch you drown<start>Inclination of direction, walk the turned and twisted rift
With the children of creation futuristic dreams we sift
Clutching violently we whisper with a liquefying cry
Any deadly final answers that are surely doomed to die
Won't you help me Mr. Jesus, won't you tell me if you can?
When you see this world we live in, do you still believe in man?
If my songs become my freedom, and my freedom turns to gold
Then I'll ask the final question, if the answer could be sold
Well, that's my story and I'm sticking to it
'Cause I've got no reason to lie, yeah
Forget your problems that don't even exist
And I'll show you a way to get high, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
So come along, you know you matter to me
Remember freedom is not hard to find, yeah
Time to stop all your messing around
Don't you think that I know my own mind, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah<start>I picked it up slow but now it's just a ritual
I didn't want the captain's role
But I'll steer us over highs and lows
It's communal but for you it's individual
And that makes me hysterical
I'm never gonna let you go
(My body's gone cold)
And I've lost control
Why d'you waste your time with me I'm just an animal?
Can you realize my head's a fucking carnival?
All I wanna feel's a little chemical rush
All I really know is that it won't take long
I'll eat you alive, I'm just a fucking animal
A simple love, no it could never be enough
And I don't know who I can trust
I'm teetering upon the edge
It's visceral, when I hurt you I can never show
This has become habitual
And I will do it over and over and over and over and over
(My body's gone cold)
And I've lost control
Why d'you waste your time with me I'm just an animal?
Can you realize my head's a fucking carnival?
All I wanna feel's a little chemical rush
All I really know is that it won't take long
I'll eat you alive, I'm just a fucking animal

What happens when the battery runs out?
The click-clack click-clack of my brain
but miss the click-clack click-clack of the train
but What happens when the tracks all gone?
Oh my god, I tick-tock for you
Oh my god, I tick-tock for you
but you never come true
Cause what would I do?
no you never come true
what would I do?
I shout it out, I'll shout it out
The batteries dead and the tracks run out (batteries dead and the tracks run out)
Now it's a mini tragedy and I mistake sentimentalities
with my memories, with my memories
Cause look at these walls (look at these walls)
Just look at these walls (look at these walls)
there's no brain and there's no heart at all
Oh my god, I tick-tock for you

With nothing going on
Seems unfortunate to waste a night
On the dope that don't come
Six days until I'm sane
Dirty heop taking me away
Looks like I'm free
From the couple of crippled and maimed
Stop me if I'm wrong
To the days of the beautifully strange
It's all been done done
So you'll stay here a while for spite
I don't care man take your time
But I won't be coming home tonight
With nothing going on<start>Pretty dancing girl
Moving gracefully
How I long, for one dance
Won't you dance with me?
How I long, for one dance
Won't you dance with me?

The bravest thing I've ever done
Was to run away and hide
But not this time, not this time
And the weakest thing I've ever done
Was to stay right by your side
Just like this time, and every time
I couldn't tell you I was happy when you were gone
So I lied and said that I missed you when we were apart.
I couldn't tell you, so I had to lead you on
But I didn't mean to break your heart.
And if I always seem distracted
Like my minds somewhere else,
That's because it's true, yes it's true
it's this stupid pride that makes me feel
Like I have to follow through
Even half-assedly, loving you
Why must I always speak in terms of cowardice?
When I guess I should have just come out and told you right from the start
Why must I always tell you all I want is this?
I guess 'cause I didn't want to break your heart
And you said;
"What'd you think that I was gonna do,
Curl up and die just because of you?
I'm not that weak, you know
What'd you think that I was gonna do,
Try to make you love me as much as I love you?
how could you be so low?
You arrogant man,
What do you think that I am?
My heart will be fine
Just stop wasting my time"<start>And I'm standing up in my practice room
I'm all alone
Speaker's almost blown
And my new Gibson amp
Oh what the hell....
Things are not so different in my vocal master
You are the face that launched one thousand ships
Greeks and trojans and a thousand ships
The shits eyeing the shores of asia minor
Lining all the shores of asia minor
You can tell that im not a minor in asia no more
I'm standing up
This is the face that launched a thousand ships
I'm standing up
This is the face that launched one thousand ships
This is the face that shot
Who never have replaced
Splitting up his kingdom into three seperate parts
For his sons and their three separate hearts<start>(Instrumental)<start>)
[Verse 1]
Must thing that I'm an actress 'cause you played the role.
You came with so much drama that tickets should be sold.
If my life is a movie, then can I direct?
Your performance isn't working, so please get off my set.
[Pre-Chorus]
Sorry if I'm real with this.
But I'm no longer feeling it.
Hope that you can deal with.
I gotta keep it moving.
[Chorus]
It was cool while it lasted.
But you's a fool so I gotta let you go.
You broke the rules,i can's have that.
You wanna get back with me...no,no,I'm cool.
[Verse 2]
In the beginning you were my MVP.
But now you warm the bench and you cannot play for me.
It seems your game is lacking but still want the ball.
At the buzzer took the final shot,but you still can't hit the hole.
[Repeat Pre-Chorus]
[Repeat Chorus]
[Bridge]
You were the star in my picture show.
Gave a performance that was all so memorable.
Like most leading men,you're a basket case.
(On the floor is your face) and your best scenes have been erased.
[Rap]
[Repeat Chorus]
You wanna get back with me..no,I'm cool.
I gotta let you go.
Fun while it lasted.
But you's a fool.
You wanna get back with me.
No,I'm cool.
[Repeat Chorus]
I'm cool on you baby.
Cool, you wanna get back with me...no, I'm cool.
Cool, you wanna get back with me...no, I'm cool.<start>It ain't perfect nothing is
There's still room to grow
Feeling different staying in
Made a little home
So when I sit back in my chair
As the evening waits
I don't remember getting here
But I'm glad I came
Don't look down just cross the bridge
And when you get there
You'll know why you did
There's a better life on the other side
It's your double life on the other side
It's your second life on the other side
It ain't simple like before
These are different times
No longer worried about getting bored
Just trying to clear my mind
From all the noise out there
All the spooks all the moving parts
Cameras everywhere I look imitating art
Don't look down just cross the bridge
And when you get there
You'll be glad did
There's a better life on the other side
There's an honest life on the other side
It's your double life
It's your second life on the other side
There's an honest life on the other side<start>Kaki narase sonzai wo

The way to hell is paved with good intentions.
Looking at the blackness,
There's an evil eye beaming down on me.
My brain implodes with torture,
As my baby sleeps silently by me.
Prickly heat I just can't sleep,
The cool night air is beckoning.
And I've gotta taste blood tonight,
I've gotta taste blood tonight,
I've gotta taste blood tonight,
Fever burns deep, down inside.
I've gotta taste blood tonight,
I've gotta taste blood tonight,
You'd better run 'cause you sure can't hide.
The world has lost its meaning,
A rat trap maze with no big cheese.
Energy drains to nowhere,
My get up and go just got up and gone.
This can't be for real,
Amnesia churns inside my head.
Frost glaze on the floor,
Reflects the truth by which I fear.<start>In the land of the lost horizon
Where the queen lies dark and cold
And when the stars won't shine, then the story's told yeah
When the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came and the people knew
That the chains are on
That the chains are on
My, my, my in the land of no tomorrow
Where you pray just to end each day
And your life just slowly melts away
Each day you hear the sand as it moves and whispers
Come and sail on my golden sea
Maybe one day you'll be just like me and that's free
But still your chains are on
Yes your chains are on
Still your chains are on
You've seen them walking on the water
You've seen flying through the sky
They were frightening in the darkness
They had rainbows in their eyes
When the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
The the strange ones came and the people knew
Yeah that the chains are on
(That the chains are on)
That the chains are on in the land of the lost horizon
Where the chains are on
In the land of world was milk and honey
Still your chains are on
Where the queen lies dark and lonely
Still the chains are on
And the world was new and magic
But the chains are on, and the chains are on
Oh the chains are on
Yeah the chains are on, oh the chains are on
And the chains are on, see them walking on the water
And the chains are on, see them flying through the sky

Your cheatin' heart will pine someday and crave the love you threw away
The time will come when you'll be blue your cheatin' heart will tell on you
When tears come down<start>[instrumental]<start>Tear myself to be with you
Turn your back and shake your thoughts

like you (please don't let me fall please do not lose control)

where or when
where all this hell had so began
maybe when you started to pretend
or maybe when I made the last attempt

I feel you mine

close your eyes
take your breath
and keep it up until there's nothing left]
My soul holds you close
in my mind through this thick smoke

Buried down in your thoughts
I wonder if I come to
your mind maybe as you

So many mothers sighing
News had just come over,
We had five years left to cry in
News guy wept and told us,
Earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet,
Then I knew he was not lying
I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and T.V.'s
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people
A girl my age went off her head,
Hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off,
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm,
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest,
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlor,
Drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine,
Don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

But the concept was out of my grasp
I only wanted to be one with the word
I only wanted to see it's fruition
Controlling thoughts and raping minds
Like painting pictures for the blind
Images I see are taking
Life from out of me it's killing
Every thought I think permeates my mind
But I am not going to believe
Speak my peace I try to explain my beliefs
And I am lauded with hate and disdain
Now that I've heard their hypocritical words
I realize there's no chance for comprehension<start>Prehistoric flower on the windowsill getting hit by the sun. Flourescent cloud hanging over top of you, you don't know what you're saying.

Along the floor were you once walked
Fighting tears that come from loss
I brave the rooms where we once talked
You took a part of me I never can reclaim

But you know it's not the same
Straining to beat this blur of tears
Swollen eyes beg for my dead friend
Reminiscing with a photograph
Drives home (that) what was won't be again
I will to guarantee my reason will prevail
Pain breeds the need for make believe
To soothe a heart that's fail
Like a wind-up clock left in the rain
Like a candle burns away its light
We all suffer at death's door
As surely as day turns into night
I drop down to my knees and plead with the sky
Of course it does no good
But I'll give anything a try
Gazing,thinking,standing on a cliff
That guards the blue-green of the sea
I accept the blueprint of the world,that
All must pass away that's come to be
You meant so much to me
That's why there's all this pain
So much improved from our exchange
It will never be same

Like a candle burns away its light

To the sound of a woman-a woman crying
Crying for a roomful, a roomful of dreams,
Dreams dying.

Just as long as you can stand there and ignore the pain
You've got a ticket to ride on this train
By the way, you're gonna ride it alone
Alone.
It's a low down payment on this pillar
Pillar of salt
It's only had one owner, and he up and died
He died of guilt.
And you can drive it out of here
All you do is find a gear
That will blow it apart,
That's if you can even get it to start.
If the damn thing just had a heart
If it had a heart-some kinda heart.<start>I came, you went
Was there something I should have said?
I'm sure there isn't
I'm supposed to know
If I could be myself for just a minute
Then I would be pleased with myself
In this relationship
Now all I want is a moment alone
Without you, without you
Time out
But keep the tapes rolling
Just in case I
Say anything brilliant
Time out
But keep those cameras rolling
Just in case I
Don't look this good forever
Like hell, I'm spent
You were someone I shouldn't have met
For your own sake
Let's take my side for once
If I could be myself for just a minute
Then I would be pleased with myself
In this relationship
Now all I want is a moment alone
Without you, without you
Time out
But keep the tapes rolling
Just in case I
Say anything brilliant
Time out
But keep those cameras rolling
Just in case I
Don't look this good forever
I'm sure that isn't
I'm supposed to know
Time out
But keep those cameras rolling
Just in case I
Don't look this good forever
Time out
But keep those hips rolling
Just in case I
Say anything brilliant<start>Rocking around the Christmas Tree
at the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Ev'ry couple tries to stop
You will get a sentimental feeling When you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly; Deck the halls with boughs of holly" Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way
Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Let the Christmas Spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
and we'll do some caroling
You will get a sentimental feeling When you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly; Deck the halls with boughs of holly"
Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily

Faster Pussycat
Let's go across the tracks where pussy ain't no feline
Rev up my Chevy I'm gonna pay to play
Baby Lickity-split I like that taste I push ahead and I fall behind
I'm just a good Good Tom I just wanna stay
CHORUS:
Just got back from the Best cathouse in town
I had the best piece of Mona Lisa I ever found
And I'm going back to the Best cathouse in town
To get some more of that cheap little tramp right about now
Let's go to the house Where business is a pleasure
And as long as there's a virgin I won't go away
Now I'm a hard Hard act to swallow And she's my buried treasure
It'll be a long Long time before I'm on my way
CHORUS:
SOLO
Ooh I'm gonna get to move in Gas in my Chevy Headin' down the way
Said Just God Get me back Get me back I say

I had the best piece of Mona Lisa I ever found
And I'm going back to the Best cathouse in town
To get some more of that cheap little tramp Right about now

You changed my life--over and over
Sexy girl--a movie queen

Now looking back--at my life
Played some games--over and over
And I broke some hearts--once or twice
Now I'm standing all alone
Down on my luck nowhere to go
Let's talk about
Who's to blame
Let's talk about
Hiding shame
Let's talk about
What to do
Let's talk about
Trying to turn what's wrong into right
Running to catch up with my life
People come--but lovers go
I'd change the scene--over and over
some give and take--is what we need
I never felt it was worth trying
Oh! Can't you see--that all my life
I'm born to run--over and over
So take me home I'll make you mine
Trying to turn what's
Wrong into right
Running to catch up
With my life
Let's talk about
What to do
Let's talk about
Me and you
Let's talk about
Who's to blame
Trying to turn what's wrong into right
Running to catch up with my life
Oh--I know you've seen this all before
Why do you keep on trying more
You tell me love's worth fighting for
What are we fighting for!<start>IN EVERY SINGLE WAY THIS CULTURE REEKS LIKE SHIT

Is say goodbye to you
But even though I love you, baby
I know you can't be true
I walked down that country road
Out to the big highway
I caught a ride on an eighteen wheeler
And I'm takin' it all the way
Takin' all these blues to the highway
Tryin' to get her out of my mind
When I'm out on the open road
With the wind in my face
I'll leave my heartache behind
Raindrops on my window
Teardrops from my eyes
I thought our love was sacred
Now I know that's just a lie
So I pack my suitcase
And head out that old front door
Better take a long last look now, baby
'Cause I won't be back no more
Takin' all these blues to the highway
Tryin' to get her out of my mind
When I'm out on the open road
With the wind in my face
I'll leave my heartache behind<start>Take a look around and tell me what you see
I guess that all depend on exaclty what you want it to be
Is your cup half-full? is your cup half-empty?>br> how can you get what you need in the land of plenty?
Everybody gets carried away
Everybody's trying everyday to remind you
(ooo) leave it behind you
What's it take to see?
What's it take to believe right from wrong?
Never knowing where you belong
Walk on
Walk on
Sometimes I feel like I'm just doing time
Everybody wonders where you're going when you step out of line
Don't know all the answers, someone's got to stand up and say "hey!"
If you want to win the game then you know you're gonna have to play
Everybody's got to find a way
And everybody's trying everyday to remind you
What's standing behind you?
What's it take to see?
What's it take to believe right from wrong
Never knowing where you belong
Walk on
Walk on
Walk on
There's no turning back
Walk on
Get your train on the track<start>Get in line against the wall
I've heard enough from your black tongue
Whichever way I turn around
I'm taunted by a voice on the ground
There's already miles to go
I've got nothing left here to hold
Got so many footsteps to go
Heavy from the burden that I chose
Hanging on a tightwire
Hanging on a tightwire
Tied up in this quiet trial
Hanging on a tightwire
Keep your eyes on everyone
Two false moves, blink and it's gone
Nothing waits for you to start
No time to mend a fractured heart
It was over hours ago
There is nothing left to unfold
It was finished so long ago
Weighed down by the story I was told
Hanging on a tightwire
Hanging on a tightwire
Tied up in this quiet trial
Hanging on a tightwire
Hanging on a tightwire
Hanging on a tightwire
Tied up in this quiet trial
Hanging on a tightwire
Hanging on a tightwire
Hanging on a tightwire
Tied up in this quiet trial
Hanging on a tightwire<start>[Chorus:]
If I don't take a chance,
If I don't make a move,
If I don't go looking for new romance,
How will I ever find my groove?
If I don't play around,
How am I gonna have my fun?
If I tried to settle down,
Would I be fooling anyone?
I'm out on a limb above a sea of bliss;
I don't know why I feel this way.
I only know I love it.
And I feel so free today.
You know I feel so free today.
That's right, I feel so free, no matter where I go,
But I feel so free today.
If I don't make mistakes,
If I don't play the fool,
If I have to worry 'bout the heart I break,
How am I ever gonna learn the rules?
I'm looking for danger inside the sweetest smile;
I don't know why I feel this way.
I only know I love it.
[Chorus: x2]<start>Such a picture of loveliness
Didn't you notice the resemblance?
Doesn't it look like she could speak?
Those eyes I tried to capture
They are lost to me now forever
They smile for someone else
Funny, how looks can be deceiving
But she`s not easily
Painted from memory
You`d think that I would know by now
Those eyes I tried to capture
They are lost to me now forever
They smile for someone else
And so this had to be
Painted from memory
She is gone, and I must accept it
She is lost to me now
But I can`t look away just yet though
She smiles for someone else
And so this had to be
Painted from memory
Funny, now I can see
How looks can be deceiving
And so this had to be
Painted from memory
Funny, now I can see
How looks can be deceiving<start>In this town, television shuts off at two
What can a lonely rock 'n' roller do?
Bed so big, the sheets are clean
You're girlfriend said you were nineteen
The Styrofoam ice bucket's full of ice
Come up to my motel room and treat me nice
I don't wanna make no late night New York calls
I don't wanna stare at those ugly grass mat walls
Chronologically I know you're young
But when you kissed me in the club you bit my tongue
I'll write a song for you and put it on my next LP
Come up to my motel room and sleep with me
There's a Bible in the drawer, don't be afraid
I'll put up a sign to warn the cleanup maid
There's lots of soap and lots of towels
Never mind those desk clerk scowls
I'll buy you breakfast, they'll think you're my wife
Come up to my motel room and save my life<start>I've been spending time alone
While I should have been with you
Why am I here on my own
When I have a love that's true?
Even though we're far apart
I know that you love me too
Don't you know I haven't smiled
Since the last time I saw you
Well I'd walk a thousand miles just to see you again
I'd give everything that I have
Plus the stars and the moons
Just to spend the night with you
I can hear the people say, "He's not happy anymore."
I've been tryin' to get to you, but I can't get out the door
If I can't hold you in my arms then what am I living for?
I can't even smell your sweet perfume on my pillow anymore
Well I'd walk a thousand miles just to see you again
I'd give everything that I have
Plus the stars and the moons
Just to spend the night with you
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Well I'd walk a thousand miles just to see you again
I'd give everything that I have
Plus the stars and the moons
Just to spend the night with you
Well I'd walk a thousand miles just to see you again
I'd give everything that I have
Plus the stars and the moons
Just to spend the night with you<start>[Originally by Club Honolulu]
Am Strand von da ging sie spazieren
und was sie trug htte keinen gestrt
nur eine einsame, pikfeine Lady
fiel bald in Ohnmacht und war sehr emprt
8, 9, 10, na was gab's denn da zu seh'n
Es war der Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Honolulu-Strand Bikini
Er war schick und er war so modern
Der Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Honolulu-Strand Bikini
Ja er gefiel ganz besonders den Herrn
1, 2, 3, na was ist denn schon dabei
Die Caballeros an Copa Cabana
die rannten ihr immerzu hinterher
da lief sie weg und vor Schreck gleich ins Wasser
dabei ertrank sie beinah' noch im Meer
8, 9, 10, na was gab's denn da zu seh'n...
Ja in Venedig war
ein Fotograf der hielt sie fr 'nen Star
Doch in der Zeitung stand spter zu lesen,
da der Bikini nur Schuld daran war
8, 9, 10, na was gab's denn da zu seh'n...
Und da zog sie den Bikini, den sie nirgends tragen kann
ganz alleine zu Hause in der Bandewanne an<start>Lost
In her face,
Caught
On the thought of a taste,
Sold
On the fantasy,
Bought,
For a price you can have a piece
Fresh
From the colour press,
The flesh
Of today's princess,
Spread
From end to end,
Blue eyes
And perfect skin
Invite everyone in.
Do you ever wonder why you want her?
Does it even matter you can't have her?
Even if you tried to it wouldn't satisfy you
Trying to possess her can only depress you
Do you ever wonder why you want her?
Does it even matter you could never have her?
Even if you tried to it would never satisfy you
You'll only want her stronger,
Long for longer<start>It was late in a Lebanese restaurant,
In the heat of a Lebanese night,
There was dancing, people were singing,
She came in from the garden outside,
In her eyes I saw the stars,
And I felt something happen in my heart;
Then I knew I was going to meet her,
In the heat of a Lebanese night,
And the girl inside the woman,
who came over to sit by my side,
And when she smiled the whole world stopped,
It was then I heard the echoes of a child;
And did you go to your bed with a sweet lullaby,
And the sound of the guns in the night?
And did you dance in the fields,
Did you run for your life,
From the hell that came down from the sky?
On a Lebanese night, on a Lebanese night;
We went down to the edge of the water,
By the light of a Lebanese dawn,
And she told me all the stories of her beautiful land in the war,
Her tears fell down, the sun came up,
And I saw again the young girl in her eyes;
And did you go to your bed with a sweet lullaby,
And the sound of the guns in the night?
And did you dance in the fields,
Did you run for your life,
From the hell that came down from the sky?
On a Lebanese night, on a Lebanese night;
In Lebanese:
All of my life, all I have known,
Only a place where peace cannot go,
All over the world, the gift from before,
Nothing is left for the children of war;
And did you go to your bed with a sweet lullaby,
And the sound of the guns in the night?
And did you dance in the fields,
Did you run for your life,
From the hell that came down from the sky?
On a Lebanese night, on a Lebanese night,
On a Lebanese night, on a Lebanese night,
I will be waiting, in the Lebanon.<start>I try real folling

When do I believe a long?
Styrofoam
Styrofoam<start>I thought maybe we'd made a pact,
But you gave into foul temptations making all the
Wrong moves and the wrong decisions
Making lies up for all the right questions
Maybe I was just asking too much
I don't think it's likely you're just made from all the wrong stuff
Your bed's been made
Mona Lisa, you've really done something,
Done a number on all of my organs
Mona Lisa, you've really done something,
Done a number on all of my organs
Must say I commend you on all of your fire,
Soaring highs and drowning lows,
Full speed ahead you go with all of your heartache
It's all greater ten minutes till doomsday
All the while just showing your teeth,
Smiling or growling, never sure I just wait and see
Your bed's been made, now go die in it.
Mona Lisa, you've really done something,
Done a number on all of my organs
Mona Lisa, you've really done something,
Done a number on all of my organs
And I've been racking my brain figuring out what to say,
But it may be safe to bet,
That the day might come where I'd forgive what you've done
But it still hasn't happened yet
Your bed's been made, now go die in it.
Mona Lisa, you've really done something,
You're the black ice on my road to wholesome
Mona Lisa, you've really done something,
Done a number on all of my organs

Bowed before the Master
Humbled that He'd choose us
We're amazed that He could use us

Hate is running through my veins
Steady now I'm takin' aim
The darkness of day, all the skies are turning to grey
I can't tune the voices out
How'd they get so Goddamn loud?
Oh, 'cause there's a side, another side of me that can't get out
A darker side that no one knows about
Can't anybody hear me?
Can't anybody see me?
'Cause I think I lost my way
Put the gun down, just put the gun down
Will anybody watch me?
Is someone gonna stop me?
This could be my last mistake
Put the gun down, just put the gun down, down
Here's where it ends
I'm never going back there again
'Cause everytime I'm standing by
The shadow's in my line of sight
When does it stop?
'Cause I'm living cold and shut off
Even when I clench my fists, it's slipping through my fingertips
Oh, 'cause there's a piece, there's a piece of me and it's missing now
Yeah, there's is a piece of me that's breaking down
Can anybody hear me?
Can anybody see me?
'Cause I think I lost my way
Put the gun down, just put the gun down
Will anybody watch me?
Is someone gonna stop me?
This could be my last mistake
Put the gun down, just put the gun down
That's when I look myself in the mirror
Now I'm seeing things a little clearer
Honest, I can't hide what's inside me
I said I'm tired of pointing the finger
Tired of this hand holding the trigger
Now I'm done with that, I gotta take one step back
Can't anybody
Can anybody hear me?
Can anybody see me?
'Cause I think I lost my way
Put the gun down, just put the gun down
Will anybody watch me?
Is someone gonna stop me?
This could be my last mistake
Put the gun down, just put the gun down, down
Here's where it starts, another night alone in the dark
Hate is running through my veins
Steady now I'm takin' aim<start>This is London, the place where you're a god or a disgrace
The whole wide world at your feet to see the look upon your face
And you watch the BBC and you think, "Well, what if that was me?"
Such a promising life to waste.
You told me, "Just be brave. Remember all the gifts you gave.
And how you felt like you were saved,
Like you were singing from beyond the grave."
And you said you'd wait for me until the day I could sing on key
"There's just something about your face."
Then you'd call, I could feel your body fall down next to me,
And I wanted us to be fast asleep, closer than anything to me,
Like we were home again...
There was just no way to know what was real and what was show
A future unfolding before my eyes, and a past that I could not let go
And how the feeling is so deep
when you're running down the London streets
Like there's nowhere left to go.
Among the faceless dizzy whores, the unimaginable bores,
Evenings stumbling from the pub, mornings shivering on the floor
Then the careless way you say, "Yeah, we were just glad we got to play."
When you're empty to the core.
Then you'd call, I could feel your body fall down next to me,
And I wanted us to be fast asleep, closer than anything to me,
Like we were home again.
I'm so tired of the rain.
This is London, the place where you get lost without a trace
Among the beautiful remains of this shattered human race
All the words that go unsaid, all the sacrifices of the dead,
"We'll fall quietly into the past or we'll just burn the streets instead"
In the clamoring of the crowd, you think, "I'll just stay quiet, instead."
All the fallen dizzy angels crawling through the street,
The pleas of people weary on their feet,
And you're half a world away from me,
As the clouds drown the light.
I wonder where you are tonight.<start>Stuffed my heart in a bag and I slammed the back door
If I get home, it'd be a home no more
Took off runnin' in the middle of the night
I was aimed for anything that felt half right
Look out, baby, I'm gone on a little ride
I see my name written in the center line
Moon looks, good air is cool
Every bone been broken in the golden rule
Well, I'm flyin through Dothan with my radio
Taylor's Ole Time Opry's playin' Hank Snow
Sing's my nightmares in his song
I said I'm with ya, man, I'm just movin' on
Look out, baby, your wish came true
You got your freedom, the house and the whole canoe
I got the things that I need
I took the car, my pride and three pairs of jeans
My brain is bleedin', got nails in my spine
But I ain't gon' stop 'fore that empty line
Radio's fadin', road's like a snake
It's two in the mornin' and I'm wide awake
Look out, baby, Gates of Eden got closed
But New Orlean's open, see the pretty lights glow
I'm goin' in to get myself lost and found
And it didn't take too god damn long to tear a good thing down
It may not be ideal
But at least we're not running at the mouth
I-10 to San Antone
Woke up and went south
Fleeced at the border
For thirty five and some change
But that's a small price to pay
Runnin' from the pain
Look out, baby, I'm gone on a little ride
There's a brush fire on the highway, gonna burn both side
Wish I could throw our sins in the flame and smoke
I'll call you up if and when I reach home
Gone on a ride, baby, I'm gone
I'm gone on a ride, yeah, baby, I'm gone
I'm gone on a ride, yeah, I'm gone, gone, gone
I'm gone on a ride , I'm gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
And you can kiss it bye, bye, bye<start>Gold, gold, bones, bones

You're so cold as you sit there alone
Selling your bright ideas
And paying someone to answer your phone
So this is life,
Come home to kids and wife
After a day of twisting the knife
'Til you get yours
There's blood on the tracks again
Do you buy, buy what you're selling them?
You know it breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
I hate to see you drown in a sea of bills
Where did you bury all that
Precious, precious
Gold, gold, bones, bones
Under platinum headstones
Gold, gold, bones, bones
Under platinum headstones
You build empires, airplanes
And smog coated spires
Up to the last blank page
When the wildfires rage on the hills
There's blood on the tracks again
Do you buy, buy what you're selling them?
You know it breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
I hate to see you drown in a sea of bills
Where did you bury, did you bury
Take my hand
Let's leave this place
Tonight we'll need our souls
And not that
Gold, gold, bones, bones
And all that worthless
Gold, gold, bones, bones
And all that useless
There's blood on the tracks again
Do you buy, buy what you're selling them?
You know it breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
I hate to see you drown in a sea of bills
Where did you bury all that
Precious, precious
Gold, gold, bones, bones
Under platinum headstones
Gold, gold, bones, bones
And all that worthless
Gold, gold, bones, bones
And all that useless
Gold, gold, bones, bones
Where did you bury your heart?<start>Makin' the notion
Will never swim
Get you more work than you ever planned
Give me some time now
To settle down
I got a new world
To wrap this head around
I had a cold companion
I was her net to land in
She knew what she was doin'
I felt a storm was brewin'
Chains, the chains, of love
Chains, the chains, of love
Chains, the chains, of love
Tell you the reason I go alone
'Cause even the debt seemed to do me wrong
Tell you my secret
You tell me your lies
Keep you clean just like an alibi
I had a cold companion
I was her net to land in
She knew what she was doin'
I felt a storm was brewin'
Chains, the chains, of love
Chains, the chains, of love
Chains, the chains, of love
Chains, the chains, of love
Chains, the chains, of love<start>Stop before you get me started
Maybe I'll just go
I'm not exactly broken hearted, but I think you already know
That there's more to the story than I'm givin up
Maybe I should just grow up
There's a picture of a girl somewhere that fits this empty frame
And there's a song here somewhere with a happier refrain
It came to me, think they call it an Epiphany, man that's a big word
[Chorus]
All I ever wanted was a little extra ordinary
Somewhat documented and depicted in this book of memories
That's as empty as a broken glass, or gas tank in my car
If you can here me now
Come out come out, wherever you are
I try hard not to remember, I wish I could forget
Thoughts of you in syndication
Just like the time I met Joan Jett
At a Grammy party on a Saturday night after you and me had a big fight
There's a picture of a boy somewhere that fits your empty frame
I tried switching the station but the song remains the same
It came to me, think they call it an Epiphany
That line was lame
[Chorus]
Are you still at home?
Or did you go to Rome?
I swear I think I saw you on some Italian movie
Showing on the plane, I couldn't read your name
Subtitles don't work on credits, man that's a shame
And it's a shame bout me and you
No one to blame but, you
All I ever wanted was a little extra ordinary somewhat documented,
And depicted in this book of memories
All I ever wanted was a little extra ordinary somewhat documented,
And depicted in this book of memories
If you can hear me now
If you can hear him now
If you can hear me now
Come out come out wherever you are
Wherever you are
I think they call it an Epiphany<start>Take it easy on yourself
Take it easy on yourself
The silent sounds of yesterday
The ghost of you dancing in the hallway
Lunar to base
Lets get this on
The kids have gone mad, they've been insane all along.
Forever may you run
Don't deserve to get lost
Soon come the waves will stop
The still of the night
Silhouettes in the half light
May your struggles all be won
Lunar to base
Lets get this on
The kids have gone mad, they've been insane all along.
Forever may you run
Forever may you
I'm looking into the end
I've got nowhere left to go
I get so in between
Didn't make it to the disco
The treasures in bed
Been trying to find the king
Lunar he was busy
Jesus wasn't there
There is no other road
We'll have to wait before we go
So let the heat come in
Where you end
I begin
Forever may you run<start>My toes can talk
And they're smiling at me
"Come down," they say
Not afraid anymore
And they talk to me
And they smile at me
I walked upstream
And I sat in the mud
Life sucks again
Watching trees decompose
And they talk to me
And they smiled at me<start>My disease,
My demise,
Makes me feel like I could die.
You pull me up from the darkness,
You lead me out of the cold,
You make me feel so good again,
You saved my sorry soul.
Its like I'm buzzed, buzzed, buzzed,
Off your love, love, love,
Its like a drug, drug, drug,
Shoot me up, up, up.
Ridin' high,
I won't last for long.
But I don't mind,
Cause it turns me on.
You get me off like a dealer,
Lyin' blazed on the floor.
Just enough so I feel it,
But you leave me wantin' more.
Its like I'm buzzed, buzzed, buzzed,
Off your love, love, love,
Its like a drug, drug, drug,
Shoot me up, up, up.<start>Give me pleasure
Give me pain
All the things to make it fade
Take me where I want to go
Take me where I want to go
Oh! Lost my way...<start>I'm a lone rhinoceros
There ain't one hell of a lots of us left in this world
I stand alone in my concrete cell
Where people stare and toss me coke cans
I guess it's better than being poached
But I'd give my horn just to see my homeland
I'm a lone rhinoceros
There ain't one hell of a lots of us
I'm a lone rhinoceros
There ain't one hell of a lots of us left in this world
They say I am ugly, call me a beast
I hear them snicker when I'm half asleep
Is beauty such a big commodity
I always heard it was only so deep<start>Rosalee you little country thang
Sure 'nuff know, how to make me smile
You like the jangle, of my tambourine
Won't you stay a little while
Rosalee, sugar sweet
How I'd like to make you mine
I'd take you down, to the county seat
You could take my name anytime
Is the air getting thinner, or are we getting high
Is the air getting thinner, or are we getting high
Is the air getting thinner, or are we getting high
Is the air getting thinner, or are we getting high
Have mercy on a day dreamin' man
My boots ain't dry from the flood
Gave you my word, to do the best that I can
I understand this bird in hand, is better than two in the bush
Who do I see but miss Rosalee
Sure a site for sore eyes
I like the things she says to me
In a voice as soft as twilight
And it's all down hill, to the beach from here, Lonely
I've got something here to share, Only
Is the air getting thinner, or are we getting high
Is the air getting thinner, or are we getting high
Is the air getting thinner, or are we getting high
Is the air getting thinner, or are we getting high
Rosalee you little county thang
Sure 'nuff know, how to make me smile
You like the jangle, of my tambourine
Won't you stay a little while
Rosalee, Rosalee<start>I knew of two sisters whose name it was Christmas,
And one was named Dawn of course, the other one was named Eve.
I wonder if they grew up hating the season,
The good will that lasts til the Feast of St. Stephen
For that is the time to eat, drink, and be merry,
Til the beer is all spilled and the whiskey has flowed.
And the whole family tree you neglected to bury,
Are feeding their faces until they explode.
[Chorus]
There'll be laughter and tears over Tia Marias,
Mixed up with that drink made from girders.
Cause it's all we've got left as they draw their last breath,
Ah, it's nice for the kids, as you finally get rid of them,
In the St Stephen's Day Murders.
Uncle is garglin' a heart-breaking air,
While the babe in his arms pulls out all that remains of his hair.
And we're not drunk enough yet to dare criticize,
The great big kipper tie he's about to baptize.
With his gin-flavored whiskers and kisses of sherry,
His best Chrimbo shirt slung out over the shop.
While the lights from the Christmas tree blow up the telly,
His face closes in like an old cold pork chop.
And the carcass of the beast left over from the feast,
May still be found haunting the kitchen.
And there's life in it yet, we may live to regret,
When the ones that we poisoned stop twitchin'.
[Chorus]<start>Ain't got no more
No more candy for you

Yr movie set

Not yr avant gard postcard idea

Have you ever had this feeling that I've been speaking of
To be so far away from the one that you love
So hurry here to me, darling can't you see

Gonna head it on back to our country home
I've got those gotta get you near me blues?<start>every day that goes by it all seems the same
people work and people slave and piss their lives away
people taking and never getting it's all the same old shit
while everything around us is crubling bit by bit
you fuck right off if you think that i 'll play a part
in this system that was doomed right from the start
a system built on slavery, domination, and degradation
production and consumption and over all corruption
fuck right off if you think you have a say
in this system that takes your life away
you can rock the boat or rock the vote the choice is up to you
but i won't put faith in those who are fucking me and you
i don't give a shit if the system falls to peices
if it all stops if it all ceases
it's not getting any better and it couldn't get much worse
the only hope and dream i have is to watch it all destroyed
[Chorus:]
there ain't no future and there ain't no hope
for humankind or change within the system
there ain't no future and there ain't no hope
in a fucked up system that takes your life away
there ain't no future and there ain't no hope
rules and regulations getting in our way
there ain't no future and there ain't no hope
the only hope and dream i have is to watch it all destroyed<start>I'm going out on the streets and I'm feeling high
But you want to fight me and I don't know why
Yeah I want to get dirty all covered in mud
But you turn on me, all I see is blood
Well let's break the law here tonight
Tonight, tonight
You want to lock me up and throw away my key
I'm out with my lads and I'm feeling mean
Well we ain't that good, and we ain't that clean
We don't really care if you're black or white
We're doing now until it's light
Well let's break the law here tonight
Tonight, tonight
They want to lock me up and throw away my key
Well let's break the law tonight
We'll give 'em one more tonight
We'll settle an old score tonight
And we'll break the law here tonight
Tonight, tonight
They want to lock me up and throw away my key
I'm out on the streets and I'm feeling high
But you want to fight me and I don't know why
Yeah I want to get dirty all covered in mud

With a rock 'n' roll lullaby
Close your eyes and don't you peep
This is a rock 'n' roll lullaby
Sandman's gonna get you
Snuggle down your sleepy head
It's gettin' late the Sandman said
Your dreams are waiting
It's daybreak in the land of nod
So get to sleep you little sod
Your dreams are waiting
And if you get a nightmare
Would you go and shake your Ma
Cause your Daddy's been a workin' all day
And if you go and get a glass of water by yourself
You can show us that you're older than you are
Show us that you're older
The Sandman's gonna get you
Well you're too young to understand
You're living in a wonderland
Your dreams are waitin'
If only we could be there too
And dream a dream along with you
Your dreams are waitin'
Careful that you don't get out the wrong side of the cot
Are you gonna be an angel or a devil
You're too small to reason what is right and what is wrong
Childhood dreams are gone too fast
There's no way we can make them last
We'll always love you anyway
Any way you are
Any way you are<start>If there is anything
You need
You can get anything
For free
Out of the darkness comes
A tree
Even out everything you see
And rise
And rise
If you ever feel the need
To hide
Go with the honest answer
Inside
You can tell anyone you find
To rise
To rise
To rise
To rise
Goodbye...<start>On behalf of Pan Am Airlines, we'd like to be the first
To welcome you to New York City.
We'd like to thank you for flying Pan Am.
The local time is 6:45 AM and the temperature is 89 degrees
I've been up all night
On the red eye flight
The dawn's early light
Got the skyline bright
I'm in the back of a car service
My driver's kind of nervous
'Cause I'm tokin' on a blunt that's fat
You say you know where you at
I say I know where I am
And if you really want a tip
Then Mr. don't get flam
I ain't tryin' to be rude
And I ain't stressin' you gramps
But this shit right here
It be the breakfast of champs
I've been tokin' on this since thirteen years old
And when I look up at my wall I see platinum and gold
And there ain't nobody sneezin' at the money I fold
And I ain't here for your pleasin'
So put that shit on hold
Just keep your mouth shut and get me to the hotel
And turn the radio up while I finish this L
Welcome back to the Five Seasons Mr. Ford, your usual room
Is ready and waiting. Let me take your luggage.
If you need anything while
You're staying, just let me know.
Good lookin' out
That's for you.
I hop out my car
Step into the lobby
Everybody's on the floor (get down)
It's a motherfuckin' robbery
The shit's in progress
I can feel the stress
I wanna silently to God how I get in this mess
They tell me to freeze and get down on my knees
Between my jewels and my cash
I'm holdin' thirty five G's
They told me to run it
So I got bold and I front it
And like Slick Rick said
I know I shouldn't have done it
'Cause now they standin' over me
Watchin' me bleed
Damn, I got to quit smokin' all this weed
There's a pain in my chest
But yo, I must be blessed
Because before I faded out I saw the EMS
The paramedics
They greet me with some anesthetics
They killin' my pain
They screamin' my name
Tryin' to keep me in the conscious world
I'm thinkin' about my mom
My sister and my girl
I'm prayin' to God
Don't let this go too far
As they rush me into the St. Luke's O.R.
They pull the bullets out my chest
And give 'em back in a jar
Now I'm wearin' this scar
'Cause I tried to play hard
Mr. Ford, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
What are you talkin' about?
It would appear that one of the bullets grazed your spine and damaged the cord.
So what are you tryin' to tell me?
Well, it's safe to say I don't think you'll be jumpin' around anymore.
Yo, this can't happen to me
I just can't believe it
Trapped in a wheelchair
A paraplegic
There ain't no rehab
There ain't no therapy
For the rest of my life
Somebody's gotta take care of me
And people stare at me
With pity in their eyes
And every mornin' I rise to a life of despise
And ever night I think I might never rock the mic again
'Cause my brain's fucked up on percacet and vicadin
Might as well be heroin pulsin' through my veins
Gotta kill these pains
Or blow out my brains
To free me from these chains
I'm trapped in this physical hell
To walk again I just might sell my soul
And I'm only twenty somethin' years old (years old)<start>Stephen Stills
Forty nine reasons all in a line
All of them good ones, all of them lies
Drifting with my lady, we're oldest of friends
Need a little work and there's fences to mend
Steady girl, she was my world
Till the drifter come, now she's gone
I let that man play his hand
I let them go, how was I to know
I'm down on my knees, nobody left to please
Now it's over, they left in the spring
Her and the drifter, lookin' for beautiful things
And I want you to clap your hands
Awwww Come on and clap your hands everybody
Yeah all right yeah all right yeah
And a little bit louder now
A little bit louder now
And a little bit louder now
Yes and a little bit louder now
Oh, you know there's something happening here
What it is ain't exactly clear
Yes there's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to be ware
And we got to stop children, what's that sound
Look what's going down
Ahh look what's going down
All right
What a field day, what a heat
Must have been a thousand people standing in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Come on, mostly say "hurray for our side"
And we got to stop children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
All right, what's going down ah yes
Well it looks to me like there's a few politicians hanging around children
Purpertating some kind of myth on us all all right
Taking bout what a drag all the kids are yeah aahh
Cause they got the guts to get out in the strees and tell the truth every day aahh yes
Making it a little hot for them, you know all right
But you know that we're all just out there proving to
Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew and Richard Dailey and all them other,
well whatever you want to call them
That America is still the home of the brave oh yes it is
And you got to be brave children
How many is it that they shot down already?
Something like seventeen of us.
But you know we gotta do it
We gotta keep on keeping on
Because if we don't do it nobody else is gonna
But you know if we can't do it with a smile on our face
You know if we can't love in our hearts then children we ain't got no right to do it at all
Because it just means we ain't learned nothing yet
We're supposed to be some kind of different Ahhh
Whoa Whoa Whoa oh yes
And I don't know if I want white America to remember or to forget
That Jesus Christ was the first non-violent revolutionary
Dig it ohh Dig it ooh right on Dig it yeah
You know that paranoia it strikes deep
Into your life it's going to creep
And it starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line the man comes
He's going to shoot you down
We've got to stop hey now what's that sound
Yeah we've got to stop and what's that sound yes
We've got to stop hey children what's that sound
What's going down oh yeah<start>Instrumental<start>Hollow like you don't remember me
Underneath everything I guess I always dreamed
That I would be the one to take you away
From all this wasted pain
But I can't save you from yourself
[Chorus]
Don't you want to feel?
Don't you want to live your life?
How much longer are you gonna
Give into the fear?
Holding you down until you're
Frozen
I can't let you fall apart
You don't even know
What you've done to me
But I would be the one to take you away
From all this wasted pain
If you could just wake up
[Chorus]
All alone, all alone
And drowning in your past
Take it back, take it back
I still believe you can
Don't you want to feel?
Don't you want to live your life? How much longer are you gonna
Give into the fear?
Holding you down till you disappear<start>body on the floor

peace that passed me by

I'll set the mood
There's nothing wrong
Prefer solitude

The deeper I sink
The further I'll go
Nothing to fear

Came in from outside
Safe in my nest
Home sweet home
No invited guests
I want to be alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
I wish you would
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
I just want to be alone
It's better this way
No one will get hurt
If you stay away
I won't lose my shirt
If I have become
Too defensive
I'm not the one
You have to live with

But not like you
I will burn too
Blinded by the night-time
Out on your play
Running the faith
Shining the fate
Blind eye no mind
What you gonna do to me and what you gonna say to me
I don't wanna hear about all your drama mishap
Running down the willing scenes and I won't suck on
Your disease
I don't need no riot gear to roll into the heaven
I am no one
Tied to you
Shine onto me
Blind mind never see
Your thoughts are the whore
Bought what was said
Tied to what you want
To what you want
Bound to what you got to run away and look around
To the money girls running down in your trees
Bound to what you get when you walk around you
Walk around you...walk around you...walk around you
Walk around you...walk around you

They want it all, they want it now
They want to get it and they don't care how
They bleed the companies they're supposed to run
Ain't no different than taking your money with a gun
They make it to Jamaica and their wire comes through
They sacrifice a lawyer and they're laughing at you

They want to get it and they don't care how
They don't get prosecuted don't even get charged
They're somewhere in the sunbelt living it large
And the government says we can't prove they did it at all
Besides they've got these underlings ready to take the fall

They want it all (they want it all) they want it now (they want it now)
They want to get it and they don't care how
These people that they stole from who's lives they laid to waste
They should have to meet them all face to face
And explain just why their momma didn't teach 'em not to steal
If you want us to believe in justice, justice better be real
Better be, better be, real
Got to be real yeah, mmm, ooh!
I'm talking to you now
Got to be real
You
They just don't give a damn<start>Don't ask me where to
Fall in a river
I might deliver
You all the way home
I guess you think I'm stupid
Or something
But that's a good thing
That's OK<start>Move over
Move over
Let the man in
Move over
Look out you'll let the man of sin in
He may tell you what be think of you
Not by his words but by the things be 'll do
Move over
Move over
Let be man come in
Move over
Move over
Let his love come into your heart
You may think you're 'bout to be abused
Yeah, but then again you just might be amused
Move over
Move over baby
You're too far over
Move over baby
You may think that he's a friend in need
But I've heard it said that he's a friend indeed
Move over
Move over baby
You're got to move ever if you want his love
Shine into your heart.<start>Well he'd been hearing too many voices and feelin' a little off-track
Like there was something big pressing down on his back
So he called up his friends and they said come on out west
It's a place where a man can really feel his success
So he pulled his heart and soul down off the shelf
Packed them next to the faith that he'd lost in himself
Said his good-byes and when the dirty work was done
He turned his wheels into the fading sun
For seven days and nights like a black-top bird he sped
Maintained radio silence 'cept for in his head
And just like his folks did back in '69
He crossed the border at needles and heard the promised land on the line
Now where the transcontinental dumps into the sea
There's a bar made up to look like 1963
Girl in the corner eyed him like a hungry dog a bone
As he brushed the desert dust off that mercedes chrome
Bartender said "hey, how's it hangin', tiger? "
He had a shot of tequila, smiled and whispered "lighter"
He went down to the desert city where the rattlesnakes play
And left his dead skin by the roadside in the noon of day
Sun got so hot it almost felt like friend
It could burn out every trace of where you been
There was a woman he'd met in a desert song
A little while later a son come along
Looked at that boy's smile and called it home
And that night as he lay in bed the only voice he heard was his own<start>C'est la fin de la fin du monde
MÃªme la mer ne fait plus de vagues
Cette nuit enfin, tout est calme
Toutes les choses tiennent enfin debout
Les lÃ¨vres et les mains se rÃ©pondent
Les mots se touchent sans heurter
Les gens qui se passent Ã  cÃ´tÃ©
N'existent plus
Ce soir, le monde dort, apaisÃ©
Ce soir, le monde dort, apaisÃ©
C'est la fin de la fin du monde
MÃªme si Ã§a ne dure qu'une nuit
Le monde peut Ã©couter les bruits
Qu'il fait, sans craindre Ã  chaque seconde
Que tout s'embrase et qu'il s'efface
Qu'il disparaisse tout Ã  coup
Depuis que ma bouche sur ton cou
S'est posÃ©e
Chassant toute menace,
Chassant toute menace
C'est la fin de la fin du monde
C'est la fin de la fin de nous
Je te promets un nouveau tour
MÃªme si je sens que tu me sondes
Et dans mes eaux, ni sous-marins
Ni plus de torpilles dans le dos
Juste ma bouche posÃ©e sur ta main
L'apocalypse au point zÃ©ro
Comme le parcours sur ta peau

Tiny dancer in my hand
Jesus freaks out in the street
Handin' tickets out for God
Turnin' back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Lookin' on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums
But oh, how it feels so real
Lyin' here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway

Tina went to the Lady's room
Saw written on the wall
"If you'd like a very nice time
Just give this number a call"
It was 6060-842
606 and I'm waitin' for you
6060-842
606 and I'm waitin' for you
Tina reached in her pocketbook
Pulled out a thin dime
Dropped it in the phone slot
Prayin' she'd get the line
It was 6060-842
606 and I'm waitin' for you
6060-842
606 and I'm waitin' for you
Dial the number to call
Get no answer at all
Dime's in the slot
Ready to trot
Uh, 6060-842
I've been tryin' all day
And I'm makin' no headway
Operator, what's wrong?
I dial stupid number all day long
Operator said,

Hello?
I'm sorry<start>you light the fire and I'll bring home a smile,
and we'll probably be OK.
Yesterday was fine but tomorrow you'll be mine,
and then every day will stay the same.
How long until you discover,
that the man you broke won't decay?
How long until you recover,
all the memories you threw away?
Take the car and drive as far as possible tonight,
and promise me you'll stay away.
For you'll be wanting more than the love you never saw,
and the motherhood you cast aside in haste.
How long until you discover,
all the lives you broke along the way?
How long until you recover,
and the man you broke walks away?
So you light me fire and I'll bring home a smile,
and we'll probably be OK.<start>Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams
In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams
I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives
Think I'll go out and go for a walk
Not much happening here, nothing ever does
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want to talk
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever it was
I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One say to the other, no man see my face and lives
Took an un-trodden path once, where the swift don't win the race
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice's beautiful face
And see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives
Outside of two men on a train platform there's nothing in sight
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's all right
She could still be there sleeping when I get back.
I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives
Noontime, and I'm still pushing myself along the road, the darkest part
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening with my heart
I've made shoes for everyone, even you, while I go barefoot
I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives<start>we'll take the long way
the roads and highways home
fall through the middle

but you can't bring back yesterday
it's always been there
it always sounds this way

Whatever you say, whatever you say
It's all from nothin' I'm afraid
You want to change my mind there's no way

Sweet sugar tastes like happiness
My teeth are rotten and my bellies gettin' round
But I can't resist, oh no no
No Way, No Way

Throw me the Bible, we'll go on like this for days
Yeah I can use the scripture too
I can't be certain of exactly what it means
But neither can you, oh no no
No Way, No Way

They took their things and headed for the coast
Denied of all in life they needed most
Loves forgotten child
Born into the wild
Come to the coast, come to the coast,
Come to the coast, it will find you
The fallout from the California glow
Toronto's frozen over this every man should know
I've forgotten now
Won't you show me how?

Come
Run away, just run away from here
Just run away, just run away my dear
'Cause love's forgotten child
So go into the wild

All you true believers
All you wide receivers
Anyone who calls this world their home
When the war is over
I'll still be your brother
Maybe we can sort the right from the wrong
Let me put it back the way that it was
Let me turn the lights on just because
Love is a hurting thing
But love is the only thing
Anymore
All you American dreamers
All you gay deceivers
Who will cross their hearts and hope to die
Bring your X Ray vision
From the bedroom to the kitchen
I've seen it all
You don't have to be shy
Who will put it back the way that it was
Who will turn the lights off just because
Love is a hurting thing
But love is the only thing
Anymore
All you happy hookers
All you nightclub bookers
Anyone who's fallen from their throne
There's a rainbow in the gutter
Dew drops on the shutters
I'm out here in the garden and I'm all alone
(So) Let me put it back the way it was
Let me turn the lights off just because
Love is a hurting thing
But love is the only thing
Anymore<start>I dreamt of cash in my head
I dreamt of princess in foreign lands
I dreamt of love and affection
My lords blessings
I asked answers to the questions
They got so many guessing
And they all point the same direction
The same point that Im missing
My dancer from Brazil
A love I cant conceal
Ive been after love for years
And I think Im getting near
To my dancer from Brazil
From Brazil<start>It doesn't take much,
To cover up small cuts,
Hid' 'neath the bandages,
Under her sleeve.
She just wants attention.
We all want attention.
She just wants it more than,
She'd have you believe.
Goodnight,
Sleep tight,
Don't let anyone bite you.
She will leave you deaf and bewildered.
Oh how she floats like a butterfly,
Stings like a killer.
All of the good kids,
Will darken their eyelids,
Cover in make-up,
And uncomfortable dress.
They just want attention.
We all want attention.
A beautiful kiss and a sin to confess.
Goodnight,
Sleep tight,
Don't let anyone bite you.
She will leave you deaf and bewildered,
Oh how she floats like a butterfly,
Stings like a killer.
It doesn't take much,
To cover up small cuts,
Hid' 'neath the bandages,
Under her sleeves.
Oh...<start>Oh oh I got that feeling again
Ever since I first laid eyes on him
Now my head's up in the clouds
My feet don't touch the ground
When he's around
And he doesn't even know it just
I'm a little bit shy this time
I'm a little bit nervous
I got butterfly's so swirling inside
I'm a little bit shy this time
Knowing there's chance he could be mine
So what else can I do
My knees get weak
And I can't even speak at all
What if he sees me too,
I'd blush and run away
What does that say
Will he figure out truth
I'm a little bit shy this time
I'm a little bit nervous
I got butterfly's in circles inside
I'm a little bit shy this time,
I'm a little bit nervous
Even though it seems to feel alright
I'll ask cupid to play on my team, in my dream
Do me a favour, and aim another arrow at him
With a note attached in my name
It's a silly game...
But I i I I'm little bit shy this
I'm a little bit nervous
Butterfly's
I'm a little bit shy this time
I'm a little bit nervous
I got butterfly's so swirling inside
I'm a little bit shy this time
I'm a little bit nervous
Even though it seems to feel alright

Hiding from the weather
Under April showers
We will stay together
'Cause we are the rain
A love that sorrow maintains
Across our endless plain
We are the rain
And when they send me out
To that desert island
Give me cheap warm beer
And fake sunglasses
'Cause we are the rain
A love that sorrow maintains
Without pleasure, without pain
We are the rain
We are the rain
A love that sorrow maintains
Across our endless plain
We are the rain
We are the rain
Over and over and over again
Without pleasure, without pain
We are the rain

The well of emptiness
But at least I'm dry
Not dead just yet
I've been praying for rain
But the sun keeps shining
I've been lost in the dust
It's going to settle soon
In any event it's a slump I can handle
I turn on my TV see gods playing devils
Just need to connect get back in the stream
Pick up the tools I see the rules and schemes
I stumbled upon
A word hotter than sex
I think it's confusion
I must put it to the test
If all roads are leading
To who judges who is it you
Well best keep on turning
You know I'm slipping the noose
In any respect there's a path I can travel
Lots of good people enjoying the angle
We just need to connect get back in the stream
Pick up the tools see the rules and schemes
Every mind that dreams
Up on the silver screen
Every fool that screams
Could break the rules and schemes

We got to figure out how to quit all your dancing
And go and check out the swag

All flaked out in Tinsel Town
Circus mouth shooting all directions
With TV ads that sell erections

It's just getting through, getting through to you
Living outside the misdemeanor
Some get lost and some are screamers
It's easy to tell the great pretender
Broken wings and flip top fenders
I got no clue what they want to do with you
It's just getting through, getting through to you
I don't want to be your suffering box
Argue art or untie your knots
I don't want to be your bad connection
Or fit into your reality vision
I got no clue what they want to do with you
It's just getting through, getting through to you<start>Around the corner the wind blew back follow the yellow brick road
It ended up in black on black
I was taught the gift of love
Smiling children painted joy sunshine bright girl and boy
bag of trick s and candy sticks peppermint kite for my toy
Yellow brick black on black
Keep on walking and don't look back
I walked along happy and them came back
I follow the yellow brick road
Lost and found I saw you down on the bound off the bound
Taught against the love yellow brick road took my load
Sunshine girl sunshine girl come to my abode one, two, three, four, five miles long
Oh I can't ever (so) go wrong
Clouds were gray yesterday down on my shoulder it's time to play
Yellow brick black on black

Because you can't win with them

You think that they're the shit

They're just full of it

You were played like a fool - it's your loss

That he's the groom
And he's been waiting
To consummate all night
And you're the bride
You're locked tight
Inside the bathroom
And you're overcome with freight
Now here's the chiller
He's the killer
You've discovered
You're trapped, alone, you're scared
We cut to you, we move in close
You're catatonic
You get a close up there
And in this shot
Here's what we got
He breaks the door down
And tears your nightgown lace
You see a can, it's aerosol
You grab the hair spray
And light it in his face
There's a very hungry man in the cellar
Oh, waiting
Or is he in the attic closet
Waiting
Debbie? I like this game. Debbie?
Debbie? Debbie? Debbie?
He blindly grabs you
Tries to stab you
But you're quicker
You over act right here
You see a cat, a ball of yarn
A knitting needle
His vision's still not clear
He's stumbling 'round
Don't make a sound
And then he grabs you
"Hide and seek, my dear?"
He shifts his glance
You see your chance
You grab the needle and you
You plunge it in his ear
There's a very hungry man in the cellar
Oh, waiting
Or is he in the attic closet
Waiting
There's a very hungry man in the cellar
Oh, waiting
Or is he in the attic closet
Waiting
And just like the scene
In "Halloween"
You think it's all over
And you're gazing into space
But you got to make sure
You hear something, you start to turn
And you're standing there frozen
Staring him face to face
And he looks at you and says
"Tag, you're it, Sweetie
Bye, Debbie. Debbie, Debbie, Debbie.
Goodbye, Debbie..."<start>Instrumental

A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way, I've found more clouds are gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee
I was a fool to fall and get that way
High ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me
It all began so well, but what an end
This is the time a feller needs a friend
When every happy plot ends with a marriage knot
And there's no knot for me<start>Turn on the television

Mud sling

Saw a Cadillac just standing still
It had breen fins an ocean wide
The driver said, need a ride?
She didn't live in my neighborhood
Her hair was too short but she looked so good
She sunk the clutch, turned the key
Introduced herself... Julene
Do what you wanna do Julene,
I wanna ride with you
She got in gear stepped on the gas
Other people saw us flying past
she flipped the switch, put down the top
When the light turn red, we didn't stop
I said, Julene, are we headed somewhere ?
She said no, but i didn't care
She pushed ahead, drove the engine clean
me in the front seat with...
Julene, Do what you wanna do Julene,
I wanna ride with you
The air turned cool, the sun went down
The lights came up on tinseltown
Julene drove slow into the dark
As we wound our way through griffith park
looking over at the hollywood sign
Me and julene feeling fine
See i don't no Jimmy Dean
I've got my hero... Julene
Do what you wanna do Julene,
I wanna ride with you<start>Time, no time
For pointless emotion
It's never helped me in this life
Oh life, if thats what you call it
But I've been thinkin'
As I sit here
I'm not feeling or dreaming or smiling
Forget what was...
And I cry out, is this life?
...is this life?
Is this life?
Is this life?
Want, I want
What everyone else has
But first I focus on my needs
I need, what no-one can give me
Am I too needy?
And all I long for
Is some clarity, sole and stay focused
Is that too much?
And I cry out, is this life?
Is this life?
Is this life?
Is this life?
Hope, I hope
That I find asylum
From all of these thought in my head
My head, has grown much too heavy
So I'll just drop it
And I confess
That security, honesty
Are just some made-up bull
And I refuse
To just fade out, to mess up and all I see is the worst
And I cry out, is this life?
Is this life?
Is this life?
Is this life?<start>You gotta think about it
You gotta make a wish and count to ten
There's just a sense of wonder
I feel a new direction looking down the lens
Jump started the action
Heard a song in my head and wrote it down
It came out of nowhere
Felt a new sensation driving you through town
You're an open chord I wanna play all day
A new broom sweeping up the sins I no longer play
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day
You're gonna see some changes
Gotta pinch myself just to believe
Everybody's having something
But I can tell you've got some magic up your sleeve
Some deep protection
When a feeling follows you around
I always need the silence
Or the lightning you bring like a new good sound
You're an open chord I wanna play all day
A new broom sweeping up the sins I no longer play
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day
Sat around and waited for a spark
And it brightened up the night
Before I get much older
I want the pleasure of seeing you up in lights
I could then beside you
Hand over my heart and say a prayer
Love's not for quitters
It's a satisfaction
Knowing that you're there
You're an open chord I wanna play all day
A new broom sweeping up the sins I no longer play
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day

You might spoil your face
If you walk in the crowd
You won't leave any trace
It's always the same
Your jumping someone else's train
It won't take long to learn
The new smile
You have to adapt
Or you'll be out of style
It's always the same
Your jumping someone else's train
If you pick up on it quick
You can say you were there
Again and again and again
Your jumping someone else's train
It's the latest wave that you've been craving for
The old ideal was getting such a bore
Now your back in line
Going not quite as far
But in half the time
Everyone's happy, they're finally all the same
Because everyone's jumping everybody else's train<start>Well, I had me a boy, turned him into a man
I showed him all the things that he didn't understand
Whoa, and then I let him go
Now, there's one in California who's been cursing my name
'Cause I found me a better lover in the UK
Hey, hey, until I made my getaway
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave
Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
Like ghosts they want me to make 'em all
They won't let go
Ex's and oh's
I had a summer lover down in New Orleans
Kept him warm in the winter, left him frozen in the spring
My, my, how the seasons go by
I get high, and I love to get low
So the hearts keep breaking, and the heads just roll
You know that's how the story goes
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

And the streets are filled with the children's shouts
I want to hear you sing that song for me
I want to capture one at a time
All the little brown flecks that made my eyes go blind
All the wide eyed splendor that I put in a frame
I want to tear it down and let it throw perspective insane
Oh, there's a light up in a box at the top of the post
Giving direction to the shadows that could use it the most
Well, turn aside governor at the sound of her voice
It's wisdom herself that offers the choice
Oh, come to the city
We're taking over the world
We're taking over the world
We are the city
With the lights strung out on the evergreen trees
And the yard lit up so the neighbors can see
Come on and capture what you think you couldn't keep
Turn on the light switch and every thing's bright
It doesn't even take a moment to erase the night
Well, how would it be if I knew this was true
If I opened my eyes and tried to help you
What good is salt if it stops being salty?
I tried to run but my cover was blown
What good is a map if it gives no direction?
And what good is home if it isn't your home?
Oh, come to the city
We're taking over the world

It was only yesterday that I was out for rhymes
Loitering down the streets without destination
kicking away the heavy weights with a smile on my feet
No direction, no affection - dazzled by the mighty blow
Hit by the weird and beautiful choir
That knew their song so well and they sang:
"We laugh about your way, cripple! We feel your pain! "
Going crazy, running blind
Trying hate, tears behind
It took me away
I took myself away
And the moon, of course the moon
There's life to tell from present days
The choir went away for the smile was on my face
Suddenly my home was reach
Seven times I marched inside her
And her walls began to fall
Eternity won't satisfy
Future has been great
Our life's a flash
In the universal rain
You stopped my heart from loosing blood
You kissed my soul alive
And the dreams we'll celebrating

Or buried alive?

Buy the night,
I'm selling the sun,
My skin feels silky smooth
Now I'm buried in mud

So far has gone to feeding my animals,

We put heads in jars
So take me please, take meta mars

Yeah, and if I'm lost, well, I don't care
'Cause I walk on endless stairs
You say it's me, I think it's you
Who can blame us for thinkin' the way we do
'Cause we don't care what we are
'Cause we don't care what we are
Take me please, take meta mars

And its for his Mom, its about his Mom,
Its about the Chicken Ranch they had in Southern Utah,
Any they grown the fingernail of a nun, like I have spoken to you
before,
This song is with love, its for love, its about love, its a negating
love,
Its with hate,its not about hate, its love, love is love,
And its about John.E Smoke and his Mom and the baby they had.
Johnny was a little lesbian midget boy,
but he stood ten foot tall with a thermo-nuclear device.
Johnny left home before he was born.
A huge Indian teepee had appeared out of Johnnys earlobe,
He didnt know why.
It spoke French and half-Dutch,
Perhaps the teepee was from Belgium,
We dont know.
All of a sudden Johnny had no reasoning
His life was a tremglescwitch
What is a tremglescwitch?
A way of life that Johnny only knew
And there was no telling how much he knew or how little
Because Johnny was a lesbian,
A shoplifter,
A drag queen,
And a surgeon,
A heart surgeon of love.
Pretty soon Johnny was a Chinese Emporer
He owned seventeen 7-11s which were convenince stores,
Known only in the United States.
Johnny sold cocaine, marujuana and alcohol,
A lot of things Johnny said he didnt understand himself,
When a tattoo of Jesus on his chest would occaisionally rise three feet
above his body,
And play poker with him,
Not knowing what to do,
Johnny would bid high,
Jesus would raise him a little,
Johnny would come back and say,
"What have ya got Christ"
Christ would say
"The Ace of Spades"
Johnny was confused again
A lot of litagation went down
Johnny became a black person,
Then an Indian,
And wandered through California,
Got him a trip.............<start>I don't take it for granted
Some things that money can't buy
If I'm left empty handed
I'll keep walking the line
If it's really forever
For a while I've got to pretend
We'll be walking together
In a dream that will never end
It takes a believer
To hold on to the truth
You tell me you've seen her
With somebody new
Don't tell me the story
Don't tell me the lie
It takes a believer
When the well runs dry
I hear the sound of her footsteps
I feel the presence within
Takes a lot of forgiveness
To fall in love again
It takes a believer
To hold on to the truth
You tell me you've seen her
With somebody new
Don't tell me the story
Don't tell me the lie
It takes a believer
When the well runs dry
Don't tell me the story
Don't tell me the lie
It takes a believer
When the well runs dry
It takes a believer
It takes a believer<start>You've got me all tied up to the whipping tree
But, oh, my friend, I'm just glad to be in love again
My dear, it's queer, I know low and I know fear
If it's real, I feel I'm not man enough to handle it still, oh<start>Oh yeah wooh
Hey hey hey hey hey yeah
Life's ambition occupy my time
Priorities confuse the mind
Happiness one step behind
This inner peace I've yet to find
Rivers flow into the sea
Yet even the sea is not so full of me
If I'm not blind why can't I see
That a circle can't fit where a square should be
There's a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
And this hole in my heart
Can't be filled with the things I do
Hole hearted [Repeat: x2]
This heart of stone is where I hide
These feet of clay kep warm inside
Day by day less satisfied
Not fade away before I die
Rivers flow into the sea
Yet even the sea is not so full of me
If I'm not blind why can't I see
That a circle can't fit where a square should be
There's a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
And this hole in my heart
Can't be filled with the things I do
There's a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
Should have known from the start
I'd fall short with the things I do
Hole hearted [Repeat: x6]
Yeah<start>Why, oh why, why, oh why can't I
Be in love forever
Oh why can't I
Be in love for ever
And ever and ever
I wonder
Why, oh why, why, oh why can't I
Be in love forever
First thing you know
Is what you're looking for
Next thing you know is where you find it
You can't explain the pain
Of feelin' so alone
So I won't even try to tell you, no
Why, oh why, why, oh why can't I
Be in love forever
Oh why can't I
Be in love for ever
And ever and ever
I wonder
Why, oh why, why, oh why can't I
Be in love forever
Some days it hurts so bad
Can't take it anymore
Those days and nights
They last forever
Some ways of feelin' good don't feel good anymore
They only mask your real feelings
Why, oh why, why, oh why
Halfway up, halfway down
Won't you turn my luck around
Halfway here, halfway there
Say the words and I'll be there
Why, oh why, why, oh why can't I
Be in love forever
Oh why can't I
Be in love for ever
And ever and ever
I wonder
Why, oh why, why, oh why can't I
Be in love forever

I feel like my worst enimies died
The poison of the streets has crept inside my lungs
And the blood is throbbing inside my tongue
And I think that I know the reason why

And I know, and I know, and I know the reason why

From my Hermits Cave
Over my shoulder to

Come as prisoner of love
I rarely ever went outside
Excepting the daily stride
I made me a weekly pot
And read Bible quite a lot
There, true loneliness I did learn

My catharsis was crushed in a wave
And my family I did crave
Oh, wretched Hermits Cave!

we never ask what the fuck we do this for.
We only have one party, democracy is just a front
they say they care about our country. All they care about is cunt.
A 6th of my paycheck it belongs to me,
the rest is what's given to my greedy landlord and government.
And all of that money goes to hurtful programs
like social security and nuclear weapons. Justify my right to die.
We turn our heads try to scream try to shout,
give the lower class power make the middle class count,
cause they're not not not gonna take that away from me.
Not not not gonna take that away
they say they care about our country,
all they care about is cunt.
We've all done little of any worth
make our oceans cleaner maybe save the earth.
Create a less harmful fuel available to all nations.
Kill our race or the local gas station.
Distribution education budget based on who needs the most help,
don't cripple minorities by basing it on wealth.
When you're young dumb and poor, you have no voice.
" Would you like fries?" is your freedom of choice.

Somebody waits for the time
I know it never comes
You get yourself so high
Then you come down feeling blue
One day youll wake up
And realize you've had enough
The thousand shining moments
Waiting just to happen to you, to you, to you
Wait until youre stronger
Theres no sense starting when you're down so low
Well, it takes the heart a little longer
To see the point in finally letting go
You lose your touch
Out there standing in the rain
When its all too much
You feel like slipping down again

I know it never comes

Didn't see the red light
Since the accident, I've walked this way

As the winter sun goes down
Someone's drinking cold champagne
In another part of town
And the only thing he thinks about
As he sips his glass of wine
It sure feels good sitting here tonight

I've got mine, I've got mine
This isn't such a bitter world
'Cause I've got mine
Someone's wandering the streets tonight
No way to warm his hands
Someone's turning up their fireplace
Making travel plans
His mind is on some sandy beach
Where the sun is gonna shine
He thinks "I don't have to hang around
Now that I've got mine"
You see them in their limousines
You see the way they stare
They don't see us looking back
Because they don't really care (they say)
I've got mine, I've got mine
The world is as it's meant to be
'Cause I've got mine
So I make a small donation
What more can I do
You know I didn't make this world
I'm in it just like you
I've worked all my life on this house of cards
To keep it all in line
I can't take care of everyone
Now that I've got mine
There's another kind of poverty
That only rich men know
A moral malnutrition
That starves their very souls
And they can't be saved with money
They're all running out of time
And all the while they're thinking
"It's ok 'Cause I've got mine"
I've got mine, I've got mine

I wait for worlds that haven't happened yet
Take care, don't beware
Follow the sound
I've been up, I've been down, I've been around
We lay beside our minds and watched the time grow
There was nothing left to find, and nothing left to know<start>The unity of me, seems a lot like yourself
Edges frayed worn down my luck
Enterprise to die for
You're to die for
It makes your brain, my luckiest number
My most hopeful trait
Bits and pieces, I could put it together
But it still won't bring you to me
Miss Grenadine
Miss Grenadine
You're a teacher, best I've had
Apple was bruised, I gave you
Now you can gaze, it's some side of me that ain't right
But I know, that you're to die for
And I know, I cauterize my left side breaks
Bits and pieces, I could put it together
But it still won't bring you to me
Miss Grenadine
Miss Grenadine
I don't deserve you, they're right
The hope and the greed, I was on my own
In her volcanic cluster, the world condom broke
Glad you lost her, can't grab her that low
Slashers sulk in my outer
Never fake their way in
Shrinking in lonely with a crowd in my eye
Measuring gold sparkle in your lab in the sky<start>As the autumn wind blows hard in crafling devastation
I was not prepared to find fate in a state of rage
Love once seemed so strong to me, promising salvation
another Tragedie d'amour appearing on life's stage
And again he hears the raven's cry...
I'm strucked down without warning
with your words like cyanide
She left me in the morning but forever I will ride
And forever I ride...
Suddenly I'm lost inside tremendous aberration
Songs that used to make me glad now make me wanna cry
Restlessly I'm walking empty streets up to the station
Standing there in silence as the trains keep passing by
And the turns his face towards the sky...
The stars fade in the dawning:
But the door's still opened wide
And still I am adorning, but forever I will ride
And forever I ride...
In love from the first time that I saw you
and the fire in you eyes
Take me to your sea of flowers
Hold me as the wind shakes the rye
Lady of the Lake: I long to be with you
Burning streams like ours cannot disband
The mist it spreads your name in early morning dew
Forever shall you be Queen of the Land
Incense leaving trails of smoke
A vision of us fasting our hands
Angels laying siege to my heart
and I shall not longer withstand
Ladyof the Lake: I long to be with you
This love of ours will never ever end
May the silver moon
make all our dreams come true
Forever shall you be Queen of the Land
Hear the song of the waves
Storm's calling up the thunder and light
A premature grave overgrown by black lilies of night
Hekate arise!
Bring back the love of my life!
Rain falls down, it soaks my cloak on this cold grey morning
I missed the last traing that could have me taken back to you!
There's no use in staying here waiting for the dawning
The fool just saddles up again as if he always knew
and again he hears the raven's cry<start>Finding solace
Finding solace somewhere
Seeking comfort
Seeking comfort somewhere
Over and over
Over she calls
Over and over
Over she falls
The black widow
Waiting for her lover
The black widow
Crying in her bedroom
Over and over
Over she calls
Over and over
Over she falls
(pull me out)
(seeking comfort
Seeking comfort somewhere)
And she cries, and she cries
Feeling lonely
She is lonely
And she dies, and she dies
Feeling lonely
She is lonely
Recognize recognize
The black widow
The black widow
Recognize, recognize
The black widow,
The black widow
The black widow<start>Call it a day
When night becomes our mad escape
Forgetting the things you mean to say
When all the right words come too late and
Everything falls out of place
Under the pillow
Out of the race
Out of the window
Devils on my shoulder
So, so happy
When happiness spells misery
And mister me hoping to be
Where ugliness meets beauty
Hope if you'll see
The demon in you
The angel in me
The Jesus in you
The devil in me
Angels on my shoulder
Call it a day
When night becomes our bad escape
Forgetting the things you mean to say
When all the right words come too late and
Everything falls out of place
Under the pillow
Out of the race
Out of the window
Devils on my shoulder
So, so happy
When happiness spells misery
And mister me hoping to be
Where ugliness meets beauty
And if you see'll see the demon in you
The angel in me
The Jesus in you
The devil in me<start>How many times do I have to try to tell you
that I'm sorry for the things I've done.
But when I start to try to tell you
that's when you have to tell me this trouble has only just begun.
I tell myself to many times
why don't you learn to keep your mouth shut.
I hurt so bad to hear the words that keep on falling from your mouth, falling from your mouth,
Tell me
WHYYYYYYYYYYY? (X2)
I maybe mad, I may be blind, I may be viciously unkind
but i can still read what you are thinking,
what you are thinking
what are you thinking?
I heard it said so many times that you'd be better off.
Besides, why can't you see this boat is sinking,
this boat is sinking.
Let's go down to the waters edge,
we can cast away these thoughts.
Somethings are better left unsaid.
They still turn me inside out.
Turn me inside out
turn me inside out.
Tell me
WHYYYYYYY (X2)
You tell me, this is the book I never read, the words I never said,
the path I'll never tread with dreams I'll dream instead.
So I seldom spread, tears that we shed the fear and the dread and the conscience inside my head.
These are the years we spread, this is what they represent
This is how I feel, do you even know how I feel?
Cause if you know
I don't think you know how I feel
how can you know?
You never asked me.
WHYYY (in the background,)
WHYYYY (x2)<start>Rainy days, cold nights to remember
Who will I find to stay forever
A life without you, no dreams will come true,
Won't be fooled just like a pretender
A whisper in the garden of eden,
Like a sound of love an' peace on earth.
Silent angel
I want to hold you
Silent angel
In my fantasy
Silent angel
Let me love you
Silent angel
Please stay with me
All alone, with a heart of stone
Candlelight never burns so bright
How can it be, that between you and me
Is no way out, out of misery
[repeat bridge]
[repeat chorus]<start>What happened to the great escape
We've ended up on a merry go round
Now all we have are shadows on the wall
We could have had it all
When did life get in the way
Striking matches in the rain
Now there's only me and you
Living on this dead end avenue
Why don't we get away
Out of this town
Shake all those yesterday's
They're dragging us down
There's nothing left round here for you and I
All the signs
Tell me to get away
What happened to the love we made
We used to give it all
So when did life get in the way
Throwing water on the flames
Now there's only me and you
Living on this dead end avenue
Why don't we get away
Out of this town
Shake all those yesterday's
They're dragging us down
There's nothing left round here for you and I
All the signs
Tell me to get away
Why don't we get away
Out of this town
Shake all those yesterday's
They're dragging us down
There's nothing left round here for you and I
All the signs
Tell me to get away
We should just get away<start>I was just leaving, the night was winding down
You touched my shoulder and I turned around
Here we are, the hardest part is done
And all that's left is loving you forever
My heart stopped beating, I couldn't let it show
You were as unexpected as roses in the snow
Just like that I knew you were the one
Now all that's left is loving you forever
In this world we're lucky if we find
A spark that sparks one time
Like when we are together
And in that moment, it happened so fast
My prayers were answered, I found love at last<start>Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, You know I need someone
Help
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never thought I needed any help in any way
Now that these days are gone, I'm not so self-assured
And now I find I changed my mind, opened up the door, so
Help me if You can, I'm feelin' down
And I do appreciate You bein' 'round, You know I do
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't You please, please help me, help me, help me?<start>Well, they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
I woke up last night, half past four
Fifteen women knocking on my door
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
Went out last night, didn't stay late
Before home I had nineteen dates
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
I woke up last night, half past four
Fifteen women knocking at my door
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
Well, they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now<start>You shouted all too loud at me
I was too blind I couldn't see
Trough your silky vail of lies
Sweet demon baby in disguise
Just got the curl up in my head
Your voice still ringin' in my head
I thought that we could re-produce
That I was more than just a thing for you to use
You were not out for me, not out for me
Were not out for me
Were not out for me
But anyone else
You told me everything's so nice
Just when you ran out of my sight
All these beautiful words can't cure
This pain I have to endure
And even thou you're far away
I think about you every day
And when I wash blood off my hands
And face and walls and floor
I seem to understand
You were not out for me, not out for me
Were not out for me
Were not out for me
But anyone else
I DO I DO, DO, DO
HATE YOU
You were not out for me, not out for me
Were not out for me
Were not out for me
But anyone else<start>I give what I need to give
I take what I need to take
I live how I see fit
I choose to follow through
My only crime is loving you
My only crime is loving you
I lie in my own contempt
Subdued by relentlessness
I tried to fight the thought
But I caved
I gave my freedom
Resigned it all to you
What would you give to know it never goes away
My only crime is loving you
My only crime is loving you
One life
never own it
Enslaved like a servant
Once the bottom breaks you never float the same
One shake
to a tremble
Con-man from within you
I can lie to myself but I cant lie to you
My only crime is loving you
My only crime is loving you
My only crime is loving you
My only crime is loving you<start>Shut eyes are haunted cells
Sharpen lids rip the shell
Release ghosts unto light
Switchblade fear bleeding dry
Obsidian recalls your beasts
Those hounds breaking into my sleep
Obsidian, will you give me
A missing part, an effigy
So would you come tonight?
Theres room enough in these dreams
But would you leave at dawn?
There's no place for you in this realm
But night is a dagger
A knife held by many hands
A barrel aimed, a loaded gun
And hundred tongues licking the trigger<start>was blue, just as blue as I could be
Evry day was a cloudy day for me
Then good luck came a-knocking at my door
Skies were gray but theyre not gray anymore
Blue skies
Smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies
Do I see
Bluebirds
Singing a song
Nothing but bluebirds
All day long
Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When youre in love, my how they fly
Blue days
All of them gone
Nothing but blue skies
From now on

I should care if the wind blows east or west
I should fret if the worst looks like the best
I should mind if they say it cant be true
I should smile, thats exactly what I do<start>I'm an idiot and I don't care
It doesn't bother me when the people stare
My mind is blank I don't get confuzed
Cause I can't think with a blown fuse
I'm an idiot and I don't give a shit
I can't read or write or tie my shoes
The government pays for my food and my clothes
I live in a big apartment building
Low income family dwellings<start>Sing to me and I'll whistle along

You should have known, you can't do that now

When I'm hot she says she's not
Don't get too close, she's over the top
Think by now, well, I would have learned
She's all talk, I really got burned now
I see what's goin' on
I've known it all along

Eu sei que nada pode escapar
Se o teu pensamento quer conseguir
Todos os caras
Que dizem ser, oh no
Muitos mais que so
E perdem de estar
Somando esforos pra descobrir
Refro:
Que eu no te peo
Para salvar toda gente que sofre aqui
Mas eu te peo
Pra tentar ver
O quanto se pode ser igual e melhor
Somando esforos pra descobrir
Quando eu te peo
Um pouco de ateno
No pra pensar s como eu penso
Cada pensamento mostra uma direo
Que muda tudo a cada momento
Enquanto vejo, ouo, falo
Penso, quero andar
Dentro de um tempo
Onde as horas nunca vo passar

I've got Jesus running through my veins
In this hopeless life that's turned on you
Give yourself to me, I'll help you through
I feed off your unanswered fear
When visions of life's end appear
Hand over your will and then you'll see
Now get on your knees and worship me
Worship me
On your knees
Worship me
In this world when at it's best
Of never ending hate and death
Abandon all and trust in me
Escaping from reality
My world it has no space or time
The crippled walk and the sick feel fine
Hand over your will and then you'll see
Now get on your knees and worship me
Worship me
On your knees
Worship me
Beyond this wall of life unknown
I'll lead you where you need to go
Void of worry, stress and pain
Left with nothing but your name
We've washed your brain and cleansed your soul
Till' nothing's all you need to know
Hand over your will and then you'll see
Now get on your knees and worship me
Worship me
On your knees
Worship me<start>Cannot control her desires
She's getting hot
She's on fire
Seems like she walk in flames
Her life is down in shame
She's got a dirty soul
She's got no self-control
In her mind nothing but lust
She's not someone you can trust
Seems like she walk in flames
Her life is down in shame
She's got a dirty soul
She's got no self-control
She sleeps all day
Waiting for the night
Better beware she's the queen of lies
Once you look at those pretty eyes
Will be too late, you'll be hypnotized
Seems like she walk in flames
Her life is down in shame
She's got a dirty soul
She's got no self-control<start>I long to see you oh my love
I want to feel you near
My need is deep inside
Well I've been rolling on,
I've been holding on,
I'd like you to know
That it's been a long, long time
Sometimes it's hard to make it through the day
Sometimes it's hard to find my way
Sometimes it's hard to notice the changing days
When your friends have all gone
Leaving this town for another one
The night is coming round
I can feel the weight of coming down,
So afraid to lose this dream
I want you to understand that I'm trying to do the best I can
It's so easy to lose my way
Lay your head where you may find some peace
I've been searching for my happiness
Don't you want to wake up and take my love,
I'd be happy if you'd let me know
Should I stay or go
Let me know<start>Curse this insatiable weakness of ours
That crawls through us ever so slight
And dulls our sensations as deep as they are
They're born in the blink of an eye
Life deviates from the paths that we're on
Flinging us off to the side
We find ourselves broken and our friends all gone
They're gone in the blink of an eye<start>Girl I'm cleaning up these loose ends
That you left on my mattress
I'm gettin' rid of all your makeup
And these fake eyelashes
And all the pictures that I hung up
You can take 'em if you want
I know you like clearance sales
Well this gon' be the biggest one
Don't try to plead your case now
Please just find your way out
Cause someone's on her way now
Out of sight, out of mind
Finally leaving you behind
I'm doing the one thing that makes sense
And getting rid of all the evidence
A million ways to say goodbye
Of all the things that I could try
I'm doing the one thing that makes sense
And getting rid of all the evidence
I cleaned the bathroom with your toothbrush
The one you won't be making use of
I even took the time to wipe down
Every single thing that you touched
But these sexy pictures on my cell phone
I'm gonna go ahead and keep those
In case you try to put me on
These are gonna get me off
Don't try to plead your case now
Please just find your way out
Cause someone's on her way now
Out of sight, out of mind
Finally leaving you behind
I'm doing the one thing that makes sense
And getting rid of all the evidence
A million ways to say goodbye
Of all the things that I could try
I'm doing the one thing that makes sense
And getting rid of all the evidence
Tell your girl: come pick up this box that I just went through
Every time I see your clothes I think of how they fit you
So I put them in with everything that's gonna remind me
The one I thought would never front I gotta put behind me
I thumbed through all the pictures we once had
Thought you were the one now you just one I untagged
Ever since we're not together everything is hella clear
I'm getting rid of all the evidence that you were ever here
Out of sight, out of mind
Finally leaving you behind
I'm doing the one thing that makes sense
And getting rid of all the evidence
A million ways to say goodbye
Of all the things that I could try
I'm doing the one thing that makes sense
And getting rid of all the evidence<start>Down from the doorway and into the street
I hear the morning bell
Over and over the pattern repeat
I hear the morning bell
And all the faces cold as stone
In the January chill
You have led me into worlds unknown
And I'm walking there still
Every time now
Every time now
I think of you mine now
I just can't contain
I'm seven feet tall and
There's nightingales calling
Shooting stars falling
Like jewels in the rain
I ask myself, I ask myself
Can this life be the same
That spun me round and put me down
And filled me up with shame
And all the heads are turning now
Down the Tottenham Court road
Cause I just can't help but sing it out
Case I just might explode
Every time now
Every time now
I think of you mine now
I can't comprehend
The saxophones blowning
Cherry trees snowing
Emeralds growing
Right here in my hand<start>A pigeon in a wet tree
On a blind day
I keep away from the ice
It's a frozen earth day
Froze time, froze place
Froze my tongue in between a yes & a no.
Sparrows in a line, rainclouds wander
I got nowhere to go..
Because my head's full of leaves
I'm naked like the trees
I'm making old October talk;
But all I do is crawl..
Won't you summer me soon
Yeah, won't you summer me soon
If the sun would rise behind a grey sky
I would fear for each step
That a tree would burst out of my mind
Mashed on the sidewalk
Grey snow in the recent rain
Serves to remind me
That winter is back here again
Because my head's full of leaves
I'm naked like the trees
In the cold November breeze
I just stand here and freeze
Won't you summer me soon
Won't you summer me soon
Won't you summer me soon
Won't you summer me soon
'Coz I just stand here and freeze
Won't you...<start>I work for the foundry for a penny and a half a day

Better deal for a Sheffield man
If he can rivet then his kids can buy
Candy from the candy man

Selling fancy city things
Sold by the man with the trilby hat
And the whiskers spread like wings
You can hear him sing
Oh you can hear him sing
Can I put you on, people can I put you on
Tell you that I love you people
Sing a salesman's song and put you on
And a second cousin works in the pits in Newcastle on Tyne
And he don't care if it rains outside, there's coal dust on his mind
It's dirty work in Manchester
But the crew gets paid its gelt
Bang on the bell on Friday
You buys a little something for yourself
And the van that comes around weekends
Selling fancy city things
Sold by the man in the trilby hat
And the whiskers spread like wings
You can hear him sing
Oh you can hear him sing
Can I put you on, people can I put you on
Tell you that I love you people

Runs for his life, doesn't sleep, doesn't take time to understand
Cause the girl that he loved went away and ran off with another man
But he followed them both and he shot at the throat, couldn't stop his hand.
So now he's under the gun.
He was born and raised and he lived like the son of an honest man
And who would've thought that one day he might gun down another man
But his heart gave away to the gun in his hand
Couldn't stop it, No
So now he's gotta run, and he' weak from the sun got nowhere to go.
Because he's under the gun, under the gun
Just a fugitive, out on the run
Under the gun, under the gun
Never see, the setting sun
He's under the gun.
Well now he's on the run, 'cause he's under cause a gun
Got nowhere to go
Well now pray for him sister, watch out for him mister
He'll let you know
That's he's under the gun, under the gun
Just a fugitive, out on the run, under then gun
Under the gun
Never see the setting sun
He's under cause a gun
Under the gun...<start>I got you

At the club where the "Dohl Pal Show" would appear
In person as themselves (oarf! oarf!)

What's your excuse for acting like someone elses decision
Elmers glue footsteps in an imaginitive state
And you want me to tell the king that i made a mistake?
The mother made yesterday homestyled surrenderling
Never had it be never, dance apology never
The definite order of events is the unmaking paul bearer
Lamp shade, tom war, one hell peep show
Keeps out creeps & co-stars
Left out lips in the reign for a laugh
The blackhand recorder solved the near future
Cops at some wives to save itself embarrassments
Save itself from embarrassments
Save itself from embarrassments
Save itself from the favorites of embarrassments
Save itself from embarrassments
Save itself from embarrassments
From the favorites of embarrassments
Save yourself from the carriages
Save yourself from the chariots
Those horses carry only arrogance
Save its wealth and appearance quick
Take this steering whip
cause i'm jumping ship
Pull out your face of ... a clinical test
The minty fresh halation casts a super imposition
The lens full of holograms, I ate myself a baby
Lullaby delayed the lottery that replaced the balls with you
Guess it til I guess it right, bet on you & bet on I
Inframed in the mansion with the glass cased commandments
Faced with a choice object provide the recklessly abandoned
All jumps, proposals, bets, debts & policies
I'll fight clocks that ain't been cleaned
Seen or heard from, tree to the steams
Sprung head & follow, back to front, bare boned & clothed
I've seen the future & I'm a basket case
Yeah, I've seen the future & I'm a basket case
Yeah, I've seen the future & I'm a basket case
Yeah, I've seen the future & I'm a basket case
Well there's yellow bellies and devil advocates
Shoveling dirt finding magnets
In the soil of our future's challenges
Trust me, i'll balance it
There's a mile high pile of confusing chord shadows
And enough self intrest involved to start refusing values
Copper penny turn over is gamble enough for me
And this solid night of work ahead is done by me for me for free
It's called a choice or a perversion towards tonal quality
And it's not worthless in the words of your colonies total honesty
This has a lot to do with useless information i've never said
So grab the end of the fishing line and make sure that its dead
Save yourself from the carriages
Save yourself from the chariots
Those horses carry only arrogance
Save its wealth and appearance quick
Take this steering whip
cause i'm jumping ship
Save itself from embarrassments
Save itself from embarrassments
Save itself from the favorites of embarrassments
Save itself from embarrassments
Save itself from embarrassments
From the favorites of embarrassments<start>All these people drinking lover's spit
They sit around and clean their face with it
And they listen to teeth to learn how to quit
Tied to a night they never met
You know it's time that we
Grow old and do some shit
I like it all that way
I like it all that way
All these people drinking lover's spit
Swallowing words while giving head
They listen to teeth to learn how to quit
Take some hands and get used to it
All those people drinking lover's spit
They sit around and clean their face with it
You know it's time that we
Grow old and do some shit

Tell me straight faced that I'm the only one
Destroy me, Am I not everything you need?
Don't move and don't breathe
I take every breath from you
Know one knows what I've done
And as I wait, I'm dying (For you)
Torn up, take me out of this picture frame
Breathe slow, Don't move as I say goodbye
Replace you, Cross my heart I hope you die
Ripped in pieces, you're my perfect tragedy
Cut me, Breathe slow
Break me, Tell me as I die for you<start>Here's a man who can't take a joke.
He wails and battles and bawls.
Here's a man who lost his control.
And I can see, we all can see, that he'll never get that joke.
Crowds of many makes a man of steel,
But alone he battles his rust.
I can't tell if he's the only one.
And I can see, we all can see, how he'll never get that joke.
Why don't you buy time, toss-around time
You want to get that joke.
Why don't you find time, and realize
The walls won't fall on you.
The critics came and changed the Earth.
Sticks and stones are all dust.
Oh, ________________ just fade away.
Words are cheap, all really deep, now we want to get that joke.
Why don't you buy time, dance-around time
You're really not that joke.
Why don't you find time, and realize
The walls won't fall on you.
Empathize and hide your eyes,
Let's just talk about us.
Two friends walk into the dark.
Got to be, when he can sleep, and we never get that joke.
Why don't you but time, toss-around time
We're really not that joke.
Why don't you find time, and realize
The walls won't fall on you.
Why don't you find time, kick-around time
You're really not that joke.
Why don't you find time, and realize
The walls won't fall on you.<start>I know
I've been foolin' myself too long
I'm never right but always wrong
Goodbye, Baby, so long
You know
You never let this thing catch on
You never let me be that strong
Goodbye, Baby, so long
There was a cold wind blowing on the night we met
The leaves fell from the trees
You made a lot of promises I ain't seen yet
And I ain't gonna ask you please
We know
None of us are gonna cry
It wasn't even worth the try
So long, Baby, Goodbye
(Musical Interlude)
There was a cold wind blowing on the night we met
The windows were rolled up tight
We both asked for something we could never get
Now I'll do the thing that's right
We know
None of us are gonna cry
It wasn't even worth the try
So long, Baby, Goodbye<start>(costello/nieve)
Above the tears
Before the scream
Invisible and secret scar
The true salvation is the human voice
Beloved voices of the past
The forever stiffled voice
Tender echoes
Lost cause
Miserable voice
Whispering voice
Incantations
Immaterial instrument
Attentive mothers
Darkness lighting lullabies
Stare of silence
Cruel disease
The ________ gag of hate
Unfailing welcome to the voice
Be welcome
Attractive red fruit of the mouth
Dangerous message on my skin
I feel so fluid
Lighter than air
Shy caress
A fleeting bride's veil on the throat
Forbidden kisses to drink
_______ siren
Virtuous sound
Vocal pleasure
Pleasure vocal
It's the real way to be drunk
To desert the common place
Sacred [bluesy prophet? ]
I'm a slave to the voice
Unfailing welcome to the voice
In every tone a poignant oath
Voices to pray to fly to escape
[harmonized]
The sublimation of the hopes
The sublimation of the hopes
Spiritual vehicle of thought
The voice [is boundless? ]
I love the voice<start>[kirk pone]

It's all around me ripped to shreds, I'm wounded and that's why
This time I'm taking mine, I will not wait in line
I'll bite the hand that feeds me, I will do what I must to survive
This time I'm taking mine, I will not wait in line
I'll bite the hand that feeds me, I will do what I must to survive
I'm growing stronger with each piece that stays there, in it's place
Not over powered, scared to death but not sure if I care
[Chorus]
I've found your weakness, you'll drown yourself within it
Letting it out, right to the heart of it, you're going down, down to the ground of it
Don't even count, no one can stop it now, won't help to shout, don't even try it

Just to breathe...
Make a God

A trick of the night air

Just like a junky
In the joy of the junk

Maybe I'll make it smaller than a child

On the cold dark ground
And the rain is falling down
The church door's thrown open
I can hear the organ's song
But the congregation's gone
My city of ruins
My city of ruins
Now the sweet bells of mercy
Drift through the evening trees
Young men on the corner
Like scattered leaves
The boarded up windows
The empty streets
While my brother's down on his knees
My city of ruins
My city of ruins
Come on, rise up
Come on, rise up
Come on, rise up
Come on, rise up
Come on, rise up
Come on, rise up
Come on, rise up
Now there's tears on the pillow
Darlin' where we slept
And you took my heart when you left
Without your sweet kiss
My soul is lost, my friend
Tell me how do I begin again?
My city's in ruins
My city's in ruins
Now with these hands
With these hands
With these hands
With these hands, I pray Lord

Every type of bone except the one that I want
Ever think what your eyes do when trying to sleep
Or where your tongue rests, is that against your teeth?
But now it's bigger than us
It's bigger than everything it decides to touch
The sleep is the safest place you can be
You can try hard to catch it, it just catches you
Imagine a camera coming up from your feet
Relax all your muscles, son, just hope your heart's in one piece
Now it's bigger than us
It's bigger than everything it decides to touch
It's bigger than a halo, a devil, an angel and a crow
The bone's got the wrong detail, I hoped it would have
Save for a shinbone or even a hand
Such a lonely ride, such a lonely ride
Such a lonely ride, such a lonely ride
Such a lonely ride, such a lonely ride
Such a lonely ride, such a lonely ride
Now it's bigger than us
It's bigger than everything it decides to touch
The bone's got the wrong detail, I hoped it would have for you
Save for a shinbone or even a hand

It didn't look good
For my brothers and me
There were 24 hours on that longest day
now ten thousand crosses
Scar the beach where they lay
Under machine gun fire
On that blood day called D
Back home a young girl was praying
God bring him home for me
[Chorus ]
When you reach out
And nobody's there
Scream and shout
No one seems to care
When you think you've got nothing left to hold on to
When you cry out
And nobody hears
Just fear and doubt
All you've left is tears
When you think
You've got nothing left to hold on to
You've still got a prayer
When my mother was born
On that South Brooklyn street
It didn't look good
For my brothers and me
Born in the back of a store
That sold cigars and candy
Cold she lay crying
And that's the way it would be
[Chorus ]
She took her last breath
And I kissed her goodbye
Walked down that hospital hall
Trying so hard not to cry
As he took his last breath
On calvary's tree
It didn't look good
No there wasn't much hope
For my brothers and me
CHORUS<start>This is a story and you're not in it, uh, huh
Fuckin' pages torn out
Here is a bedroom that you've never been in and
Here is your shovel, there's the ground
Look, two lovers covered in covers, uh, huh
I can put us to bed tonight
I am bruised but she is dressing my wounds and
Night nursing a broken man
She was not the cure for cancer
And all my questions still ask for answers
There is nothing like someone new
And this girl, she was nothing like you
After waking up post operation
I find I've come in a dream again
All the pain, almost as painful as ever but
Something in me was not the same
At night, during dreams of submission
I could claw back my heart and soul
As the size of the tumor diminishes
So it filled that black hole
She was not the cure for cancer
And all my questions still ask for answers
There is nothing like someone new
And this girl, she was nothing like you
She was not the cure for cancer
And all my questions still ask for answers
And there is nothing like someone new
And this girl, she was nothing like you
(There is nothing like someone new)
(And this girl, she was nothing like you)
Nothing like someone new
And this girl, she was nothing like you<start>Door

Fighting with friends
It's a matter of time
Between love and despair
Falling over the line
Empty hearts and icy stares
Call me Solitaire
The eyes
In the face on the wall
Follow me round the room
Follow me everywhere

A man without a child
Alone with all my sorrow

Fighting with friends

For every good thing, must you get bad?
But I won't worry, 'cause if I'm living on borrowed time
I'm just gonna keep on, the way I'm going
Keep on the way I'm going
Keep on the way I'm going

And every valley has a mountainside
No, I can't trade just to be happy

Or looks my way, or calls my name

She's around me now
Almost all the time
And if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now quite a long, long time
And I feel fine
Every now and then the things I lean on lose their meaning
And I find myself careening
In places where I should not let me go
She has the power to go where no one else can find me
Yes and silently remind me
The happiness and the good times that I know, but as I had got to know them
It isn't what she's got to say
But how she thinks and where she's been

I like to hear them best that way

What she says them mostly just to calm me down<start>Everytime I'm kissing you I think of you kissing him
I came home and I found you in the arms of a friend
I should have turned and walked away when I saw you kissing him

You even said you were ashamed but it hurts me just the same
And I'll have to pay the cost cause I can't hold the love that's lost
I thought I was the only one but you don't know the harm you've done
'Cause everytime I'm kissing you I think of you kissing him

I will keep you in the corner of my eye
I will never leave your side
Though you call me your number one zero
Your never mind

I will build a pedestal and put you upon it

I'll be creeping up behind
Cause if I need to
I will keep you in the corner of my eye
Corner of my eye
Down on the street, over your night
Out of your sleep, out of your sight
If I need to, if I need to
Out of your mouth, in every word
Down in your ego one thing is sure
I will keep you, I will keep you
But just when you think you've left me blind
I will be creeping right up behind
Cause baby if I need to
Lord, I will keep you in the corner of my eye
I will be the bird in your straw
But you won't get far
I will keep you in the corner of my eye<start>This problem is insoluble
The answers seem impossible
The logic ceases to exit
Emotion is the beat we miss
I stand on a world
Where dreams, realities, existence are the same
We take from our mother's skin
But the world is not to blame
[Chorus]
Who tells the wind which way to blow ?
I wonder who will stop the rain
The rocks that hold the secrets, they don't know
So who can stop the rain ?
We've lost the path for all we know
Now tell me when will it start again ?
And as the old man lifts his hands
Please can you stop the rain
Stars fall far away
Like they never did before
A new moon shining
Like it never will again
[Chorus]
Desert white cloud
Spirits they sing
Rain falls from the big sky
Onto broken wing
There is no sense in turning back
To wash the dÃ©bris from the track
World without reason without rhyme
We fought for peace within our time
[Chorus]<start>When the wind picks up can carry me home,
'cause of a large ship stuck in the sea all alone,
so rock me in your storm,
'cause sleeping is hard some times.
When the rain picks up or the blue skies shine,
there the night I watch the Northern lights,
just to calm my heart,
'cause breathing is hard some times.
I'm off to wherever
Into what ever
Off to wherever
Into what ever
When the wind picks up can carry me home,
'cause of a large ship stuck in the sea all alone,
so rock me in your storm,
'cause sleeping is hard some times.
When the rain picks up or the blue skies shine,
there the night I watch the Northern lights,
just to calm my heart,
'cause breathing is hard some times.
I'm off to where ever
Into what ever
Off to where ever
Into what ever<start>Nobody said it would be easy
But nobody said it`d be this hard
Making my way with no direction
Can hardly believe I`ve come this far
I`ve got a fire
Burning inside my heart
I`ve got a dream that helps me to be strong
If there`s one thing that I know
With a million miles to go
Nobody, no one
Can take away my song
Everybody has a say
About the way I should be living
Everybody says they understand
Ain`t if funny how when times get tough
And the road gets rough
And you`re falling
Nobody`s there to lend a hand
I`ve got a fire
Burning inside my heart
I`ve got a dream that helps me to be strong
If there`s one thing that I know
With a million miles to go
Nobody, no one
Can take away my song<start>The good old days are gone and they're going away
Look into my face and you got nothing to say to me
The grass is always greener when it 'aint going on
It 'aint going on and our friendship has gone away
Back in the past, a memory in the past
Fade away, slowly fade away
Back in the past, a memory in the past
And I say just get out of the way
I've been waiting for this chance
for you to hear what I'll say
I'd knew you'd come 'round and see the light of day
Your friendships are like a fashion
that will soon go away
When things look good I'll see your face one day
I've been waiting for this day,
I've been waiting for this chance to say.<start>A yes yes y'all
It's too fresh y'all
A little b-boy blue
You know it's too beucou
I've been from New York to Cali
Spent two days in the valley
And I think I'm 'bout to lose my mind
And if I think 'bout it one more time
I'm a blow my stack
See ya out the back
Give me some room that I can breathe in
Now I'm a start weavin' spells like a wizard
King of the lizard
My mojo's risin' like my nature should
Not everybody can relate to hood
But I used to roll with high frequency
Had a habit of juvenile delinquency
If y'all could see all the things I did
When I was a kid
Ya might flip ya lid
'Cause, when I was the age of one
My father gave me my very first gun
When I was the age of two
I was pullin' out records with the SD Crew
And when I was the age of three
I had all the maddest fishes swimmin' after me
And when I was the age of four
I was bustin' out shows with the rhymes galore
[Chorus: x2]
I say day to the night
Night to the day
Up around where I stay
We do things this way
You got to watch how you act
And watch what you say
'Cause their ain't no stallin'
When the death come callin'
The man that lives by the pistol
Dies by the smokin' gun (gun)
I think I hear a steam whistle
Lord, when my train gonna come
The man that lives by the pistol
Dies by the smokin' gun (gun)
I think I hear a steam whistle
Lord, when my train gonna come
Yo, all you duns packin' guns
Fightin' for ones
It's time to get these hons
Start raisin' some sons
Plant your seed in some fertile soil
And watch me start bubblin'
Like I'm 'bout to boil
Like Olive Oyle love Popeye
Just won't stoppa
I got to keep rockin'
Ticks keep tockin'
Time keeps slippin'
My mind keeps trippin'
I'm in the road less traveled
Sure got lotta stones
[Chorus: x2]
Watch me break it down
There's a red house yonder
Just over the hill
With my name carved into the window sill
I think I'm gonna burn it down
Yeah, I think I'm gonna burn it down
That's what me and my old woman used to say
We used to lie in bed and make love all day
Now I think I'm gonna burn it down
Yeah, I think I'm gonna burn it down
Yeah, I think I'm gonna burn it down to the ground
The man that lives by the pistol
Dies by the smokin' gun (gun)
I think I hear a steam whistle
Lord, when my train gonna come
The man that lives by the pistol
Dies by the smokin' gun (gun)
I think I hear a steam whistle
Lord, when my train gonna come<start>Ours is the cry of the helpless, told
In the timeless truth of the written word.
Trapped by the tempest of the blind
Our muted calls can't be heard.
Helpless as we stand
Amidst the push of thoughtless hands.
We are adrift without direction
In a raging storm on a calm sea.
Clinging to our expectations
To stem the tide of destiny.<start>You got me right where you wanted me
So what do we do if I can't hold this pose for too long?
Do we shoot again, or does the whole operation shut down and we go back to the board?
I practiced all my lines, oh yea I'd feed every child in the world
But it's a one night stand baby
We gotta keep on
If you got it all then you got it right
I'm gonna do what you say and get way out of line
Nobody's gonna stop me now
It's not how it looks unless you saw nothing
We all agree this proposal's been sentenced to death
Are we baiting the right hook to catch your attention?
The media needs another blackout
We've been calling
Flooding hotlines
We've applied mascara to the radio but that's just a quick fix and we need a little more
Does it matter to you at all?
Are you listening or have you tuned out?
We've gotta get it together
But first we drink and we take it all apart
Everywhere we go we're the local boys and we're back in town
Well that's the way it is
It breaks my heart
We've applied mascara to the radio, but that's just a quick fix and we need a little more
Does it matter to you at all?
Are you listening or have you tuned out?
Get by
Get gone
Get high
Get wronged<start>Drink up beautiful
I spiked your cup with angst and a heart attack,
'Cause I've got so much trapped and it's all because of you
So I figured you might like some back
But when I see her I'll tell her what's been on my mind all these sleepless night
She'll recite her excuses I'll put my tail between these legs of mine like I do all the time
I can't live my life knowing you'll be in his arms each time I blink my eyes
I know what goes on behind my back,
Every night I'm afraid I'll never leave,
Afraid I'll never know what's good for me
But when I see her I'll tell her what's been on my mind all these sleepless night
She'll recite her excuses I'll put my tail between these legs of mine like I do all the time
And now you say that,
You say you love me
Well I may have your heart, but he has your body
And now you swear that you're being honest,
But you're not honest, you never could be
But when I see her I'll tell her what's been on my mind all these sleepless night
She'll recite her excuses I'll put my tail between these legs of mine like I do all the time<start>When She Was
Here I Seemed To Be More Than I Was
Cause It Was All That I Could Be , She Was My Only Cause
I Wasn't Able To Overcome That Feeling That
Makes It Possible To Destroy And Rebuild My Broken Heart
[I Know You're Thinking Now]
That The Life Of Every Man Maybe Is Only A Great Dream
I Can't Understand Why I Do Not Wake Up When I Scream
And My Dream Becomes A Mix Of Fear, Just Today
Everything Becomes So Dark, But
I Still Smile At The World The Same Way
Leave Me Alone
Or Take Me With You, Honey
And Let Me Be Your Victim
I'm Screaming Out
This Time I Want To Lie Down
Only You Know How To Now
Cry For My Dark Future
[No Matter What You Think
No Matter What You Have To Say No]
Crumble Down My Thoughts For You And I
Fall Down
It's The Same
Since Then The Sun, Moon And Stars Still Know Their Calling,
I Do Not Know If It Is Day Or Night That Matters While Everything Is Falling
Everything Belongs To Past As Time Goes And Now I'm Crawling
[I Know You're Thinking Now]
And I Do Not Know Why I Feel This Way I Think Of You And Me
And One Of Our Last Quarrels Maybe That's What Destiny Is
Anger Seizes Me And I Would Want To Run As Far As I Can
Almost Not Caring About What Is There After The Death Now
Wow Heal The Darkness Of My Soul
I Want To Breathe In Deeply, But I Don't Know
If I Can Maybe One Day Walk On Another Road
Please Don't Let Me Fall
I Won't Go
I Lose Control
Take My Breath And My Soul
Hold It All Or Let It Go
Girl, Now You're So Far Away
I Can't Wait<start>Ain't nobody gonna turn me around no more
Ain't nobody gonna turn me around
Well, I've learned my lesson and now I see
Love ain't the thing for me
Ain't nobody gonna turn me around
Turn me around, turn me around, turn me around
Ain't nobody gonna talk sweet talk to me
Ain't nobody gonna tell me how sweet love can be
I'm gonna take my love and put it on the shelf
Ain't gonna give it to nobody else
Ain't nobody, who's gonna turn me around
Turn me around, turn me around, turn me around
Love, you've been so doggone mean
You shattered every one of my dreams
You know I can't love nobody else
But still you left me here all by myself
Turned me around, you turned me around
You turned me around, you turned me around
I've learned my lesson and now I see
Love ain't the thing for me
Ain't nobody, baby, who's gonna turn me around
Turn me around, turn me around, turn me around<start>I don't want to hear his name
It only makes me feel ashamed of those wasted days
And when I see his face I wish that I could make him disappear
My guitar was getting trashed so I made him give it back
Now he won't let up, saying I took his stuff
I wish that he would just disappear
You can't say I'm anti-everything
I just don't think the whole world owes him something
He's been talking to my friends
I hope they don't invite him in again
What I wouldn't do: go back to '92 and erase the moment I met you
And make you disappear<start>The girl from all those songs
Who made everything feel right
She came in like an angel, into your lonely life
And filling your world with light
Oh, and everybody told you "you're oh so lucky"
Curtains part revealing a country scene
Clothed in green and brown
Evidence of autumn
And recent rain
On a winding lane, a byway
Walking on that road is a certain girl
In all the world the one
Guaranteed to move you and turn your head
When all's been said and done
The girl from all those songs
Who made everything feel right
She came in like an angel, into your lonely life
And filling your world with light
Oh, and everybody told you "you're oh so lucky"
The night is clear but cool
Ooh maybe dawn is breaking as you turn to find her gone
Then you see the note
Ooh you cannot believe it
And you think you'll go insane<start>Life won't change today
Every single day
Things don't come my way
It's just my time to fade
They move on, people they go out
Just why the filler is without
Things don't come my way
I Cover up my face
At my only rate
Every single day
You sit still and the twins walk right by
You feel thin, as the lead of your life
Dress on, the feeling, correspond
With the side of the road that we're on
Life won't change today
I cover up my face
Every single day
At my only rate
You sit still and the twins walk right by
You feel thin, as the lead of your life
People want to whisper when they shout
And move on, the people they go out
Nothing will change today
Is what I always say
Yes, things will get too rough
I can never get enough
They move on, people they go out
It's just why the filler is without
People want to whisper when they shout
It's 'cause on the inside, they're in doubt
Life won't change today
I cover up my face
At my only rate
It's just my time to fade<start>Swarbrick
I know Rosie
You're living in a world you didn't make
And I know it's hard feeling happy
When the things you want aren't even there to take
Come on Rosie, rosin up the bow
For the more I learn it's the less I seem to know
Lie down cozy and let's learn to take things slow
For the more I learn it's the less I seem to know
Of my Rosie
Come on, my Rosie, rosin up the bow
Throw away your uniform
Now's the time to take things by the hand
Come on in and take your coat off
Settle down and listen to the band
And ain't that grand, Rosie<start>Amazing Grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.<start>Killing's my business and business is fine
Money's my interest, life isn't kind
You know you can run but there's nowhere to hide
Payback's a bitch boy
Now you're gonna die
Hand me the contract, I've got no remorse
The more cash I get, the bloodier the worst
You claimed their way out, life is up in flames
How 'bout doin' it my way
Beheaded or slain
[Chorus:]
Hanging or lethal injection
Gas chamber - take a last breath
Firing squad, electrocute, we'll execute!
More than one face of death
Kill 'em all, let God sort 'em out
A soldier of fortune, I'll wipe 'em all out
Having no home, I have no shame
I'll take a life, another victim in pain
Try turning the tables or make it a frame
You can't snuff me out
Because you're my game
You know you're my target
Your time stands still
But no job's too tough
I love to kill<start>You got a reputation
Goin' all over town
For buildin' up a love affair
So you can't tear it down
The hearts you've stepped on one by one
Are prices that you'd pay
But still I'm so in love with you
My little miss heartache
Little miss heartache
They call you and I know it's true
Little miss heartache
You're lovely in your shades of blue
The hearts you've stepped on one by one
Are prices that you'd pay
But still I'm so in love with you
My little miss heartache
Someday I know you'll fall for someone
I hope it's me
And all the other loves you've known
Are just a memory
A world that's filled with happiness
Is here for you to take
Please let me be the next in line
I love you miss heartache
Little miss heartache
They call you and I know it's true
Little miss heartache
You're lovely in your shades of blue
The hearts you've stepped on one by one
Are prices that you'd pay
But still I'm so in love with you
My little miss heartache<start>I've been driving around town
With my head spinning around
Everywhere I look, I see
Your '96 Jeep Cherokee
You're a bully and a clown
You made me cry and put me down
After all that I've been through
You think I'd hate the sight of you
But with every jeep I see
My broken heart still skips a beat
I guess it's just my stupid luck
That all of Boston drives the same black, fucking truck
It could be him or am I tripping
And I'm crashing into everything
And thinking about skipping town a while
Until these cars go out of style
I try to see it in reverse
It makes the situation hundreds of times worse
When I wonder if it makes you want to cry
Every time you see a light blue Volvo driving by
So don't tell me if you're off to see the world
I know you won't get very far
Don't tell me if you get another girl
Baby, just tell me if you get another car
It could be him or am I tripping
It could be him
The number of them is insane
Every exit's an ex-boyfriend memory lane
Every major street's a minor heart attack
I see a red jeep and I want to paint it black
It could be him or am I tripping
And I'm crashing into everything
I can't wait till you trade the damn thing in
By then they will have put me in the looney bin
It could be him my heart is pounding
It's just no use, I'm surrounded
But one day I'll steal your car and switch the gears
And drive that Cherokee straight off this trail of tears<start>Alright now boys and girls we've got another story for you now!
We want to introduce to you another friend of the Bible!
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
If I were God there would be no explicit sex on T.V.
Like little Opie eating pie when he made it with Aunt Bea
If I were God thou shall not worship false Billy Idols
And thou shall add the Book Of Flavor Flav to the Bible
Thou shall make fun of Hindus thou shall not make a "Speed 2"
If I were God that's what I'd do Heavens no
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
If I were God I'd get a bunch of slaves to do everything
Norwegian lesbians that feed me grapes and know how to sing
If I were God thou shall not wear tube socks with Flip-Flops
Thou shall sit and thou shall spin thou shall even wife swap
Thou shall resist the Olsen Twins thou shall not cut "Footloose"
If I were God that's what I'd do Heavens no
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
And when they nail my pimpled ass to the cross
I'll tell them I found Jesus that should throw them off
He goes by the name Jesus and steals hubcaps from cars
Oh Jesus can I borrow your crowbar?
To pry these God damn nails out they're beginning to hurt
Crucified and all I got was this lousy tee shirt
"I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!" I'll sing as I'm flogged
Yeah that's what I would do if I were God
So vote for me for Savior and you'll go to Heaven
Your lame duck Lord is like Kevin Spacey in "Seven"
With creepy threats of H-E-Double-Hockey-Stick
You just can't teach an old God new tricks
But would I be a good Messiah with my low self-esteem?
If I don't believe in myself would that be blasphemy?
Just sport some crummy "holier than thou" facade
Yeah that's what I would do if I were God<start>When I grow up to be a Man.
Will I dig the same things that turn me on as a kid?
Will I look back and say that I wish I hadn't done what I did?
Will I joke around and still dig those sounds
When I grow up to be a Man?
Will I look for the same things in a Woman that I dig in a Girl?
(14-15)
Will I settle down fast or will I first want to travel the world?
(16-17)
Now I'm young and free, but how will it be
When I grow up to be a Man?
Will my kids be proud or think their Old Man's really a square?
(18-19)
When they're out havin' fun, will I still wanna have my share?
(20-21)
Will I love my Wife for the rest of my life
When I grow up to be a Man?
What will I be when I grow up to be a Man?<start>Every day, always the same.
I hear your name and it cuts through me like a chainsaw
And i fall back into that simple fool you always knew.
And just as soon as i let you back in
Seems I'm reminded of all of this again.
Bringing me down.
How much more will it take till i brake.
And i drive that stake
Right into that thing that you call your heart
Hell its fallen apart
And i don't think it works right from the start.<start>Verse 1:
Theres no greater love than this
For You to save us
Burdened with all our sin
You came to take this from us.
Verse 2:
As the heavens mourned
And all the clouds went grey
All the earths restored
by Your saving grace
Verse 3:
Eternal love unfailing grace
The gift You freely gave
Son of God and son of man
At the cross You took Your stand
Pre Chorus:
As the barrier was broken
Between heaven and earth
All the heavens cried out
Chorus:
Worthy is the Lamb, Worthy is the Lamb
Seated on the throne, Seated on the throne
Turnaround: You are God in the highest
Bridge:
You are the One
Who is and will be to come
Glory in the Highest
Highest, Highest, Highest, You are God in the Highest<start>We stay out all night, we piss and then we moan
Got coke heads that never rest at home
You got Outkast, you got to dress the best
You got a Rolex that tells American time
What you want to lie down for
Calm down because you can't
Whatcha want to, whatcha looking at
Live it up because you can't
Don't want to look alive
We want your suicide
We don't do what you do
We don't live here
Fuck in LA
Fuck in LA
Yeah, fuck in LA
Fuck in LA
Nazerenne says we go to Cancun
You can't do this with Nazerenne and you
We got 12 steps and a chip and we walk
Down the street without a life to be shut out
Don't want to look alive
We want your suicide
We don't do what you do
We don't live here
Fuck in LA
Yeah, fuck in LA
Fuck in LA
Yeah, fuck in LA
Fuck off
Fuck in LA
Fuck in LA
Cross your legs and sleep tonight
Beat your lovers till the sunlight
Cross your legs and sleep tonight
The whiskey bar's gone serve us
Don't do this you can't run
You got 24hours with your favorite gun
We don't do what you do
We don't live here
Fuck in LA
Yeah, fuck in LA
Fuck in LA
Yeah, fuck in LA

There's another kind of story she doesn't want to tell.
There's another road to hell, behind the bluer eyes horizon.
Stolen secrets say she knows he's never gonna stay.
I'll be the sun, I'll be the rain over you.
So he sees her, when he sees her,
she doesn't know what it means if the story's just a dream.
So I tell you words, she can't go back.
The story has to end and he knows,
when he sees her running on...
sees her running, sees her running on and on away.<start>I overheard the elders telling each Other stories about the days when They were young back on

You got an albatross around your neck

Cause you got a slowly ticking time bomb and then you see red

You burnt the lungs
That your ancestors created
You sat by the banks
Of the river and you waited
Till time rolled back
And the water had abated
You drank your share
But you still could not be sated
Quicksands of the mind
And the sinkholes you may find
When you look through
The twisting of the vines

Time comes round
The game is itching at your bone
Chill wind comes round
It's blowing through your home
Quicksands of the mind

You burnt the lungs
That your ancestors created
You sat by the banks
Of the river and you waited
Till time rolled back
And the water had abated
You drank your share
But you still could not be sated
You said you're scared
Of the clocks that keep ticking over

Elizabeth<start>Well we finally made it home,
From a four week battle out on the road
Amazing shows,
Overshadowed by inflated egos
I never thought I'd hear myself say that,
I'm just happy to be home again
But I still know,
Being back will get old
But I still know,
I'm raring to go
It's just so hard to adjust
Back to a normal life
Everything's been taken from me
Depending on my best friends to survive
I wouldn't change a single moment
The train wreck I call my life
I'd make all the same sacrifices
To see kids that scream the words I write
I never thought that we'd be here
Can only hope that
You still care<start>She smiles
Then she laughs and then
She rights the wheel
On the road again
While all you fear are her thighs
A man
makes a man a man
is that the way
to kiss a friend?
She is not
She is so
Kindly meet me under stairs
a city skyline just don't care what comes
but we should mind that we don't
To sound
Them bells
Skin thick
To tell
Not sick
Nor well
The air
To speak
The nose
The feet
The ear
To see
Too fool
To stop
Too late
Blue cop
And you
Are meeeeeeeeeeeeeee
To wear
No clothes
To strike
No pose
No hook
No shoes
Quick eat
Then home
To clean them bones
To stick
To guts
The art
Of loud
Too neat
Too proud
No taste
No foul
The part
To keep
To yield
To beat.....<start>When I was a young man
Just gotten out
I didn`t know
What this world was all about
I was lied to, I was cheated
I played all kinds of fools
It didn`t take me long
To learn the rules
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, shame on me
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, shame on me
Lady swore she loved me
Loved through and through
And then my pal said
She said she loved him, too
And the milkman and the postman
And in a dream
I saw her with the local
Football team
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, shame on me
Fool me once
Do me as bad as you can do
Shame on you
Shame on you
Fool me twice
I`ll be as mad as I can be
Shame on me
Shame on me
Banker took my money
Bought him a stake
The banker swore that one day
We`d both feel great
Then the 80`s turned to the 90`s
And my money can`t be found
Banker`s on a long trip
Out of town
Fool me once
Do me as bad as you can do
Shame on you
Shame on you
Fool me twice
I`ll be as mad as I can be
Shame on me
Shame on me<start>You can really go go go
Jumpin' fast or rockin slow
I will see ya when the band gone blow
Now hold it, don't move it
Now boogie some more
I'm a good rockin'' daddy
Yeah well I'm a good rockin' daddy
Up on my feet I can't be beat
I'm a good rockin' daddy
I told the girls all to come and see
Just what the sandman brought to me
They stood around with a great big smile
And when you start to rock n' roll
They all went wild
I'm a good rockin daddy
Yeah well I'm a good rockin daddy
Up on my feet I can't be beat
I'm a good rockin daddy
Well I'll hold you close and I'll hold you tight
You'll rock n' roll from left to right
'Round and round and round we go
Rest awhile and we'll boogie some more
I'm a good rockin' daddy
Yeah well I'm a good rockin' daddy
Up on my feet I can't be beat
I'm a good rockin daddy
Good Rockin' Daddy
Good Rockin' Daddy
Good Rockin' Daddy
Good Rockin' Daddy<start>Your situation's on the top of my head
I don't know what to do
I know it's painful but it's got to be said
These things you're going through
Oh, you can't do that
You always had a way of keeping things in it's just the way you are
It's only lately I don't know where you've been
I'm afraid you'll go to far
Oh, you can't do that
I miss the way we were before we got lost
It will never come again
I'm only trying to get the wires uncrossed
Before it all ends<start>There is no beginning to the story, a bookshelf sinks into the sand
And a language learned and forgot, in turn is studied once again
It's a shocking bit of footage viewed from a shitty TV screen
You can squint at it through snowy static to make out the meaning
And just keep stretching the antennae, hoping that it will come clear
We need some reception, a higher message, just tell us what to fear
Because I don't know what tomorrow brings
It's alive with such possibilities
All I know is I feel better when I sing
Burdens are lifted from me
That's my voice rising
So Michael, please keep the tape rolling
Boys keep strumming those guitars
We need a record of our failures, we must document our love
I've sat too long in my silence, I've grown too old in my pain
To shed this skin, be born again, it starts with an ending
So thank you friends for the time we shared
My love stays with you like sunlight and air
Oh, I truly wish I could keep hanging around here
But my joy is covering me, soon, I will disappear
Well, not a movie, no private screening
This method acting, well, I call that living
It is a fountain, all the doors are open
We got a problem with no solution
But to love, love, love and to be loved
So I've made peace with the falling leaves
I see their same fate in my own body
I won't be frightened when I am awoken from this dream
And returned to that which gave birth to me
And the story goes, and the story goes
And it goes on and on and on and on
It's going on and on and on
It's going on and on and on
It's going on and on and on
It's going on and on and on
And on
And on
And on
...<start>She gave me the queen
She gave me the king
She was wheelin' and dealin'
Just doin' her thing
She was holdin' a pair
But I had to try
Her deuce was wild
But my ace was high
But how was I to know
That she'd been dealt with before
Said she'd never had a full house
But I should have known
From the tattoo on her left leg
And the garter on her right
She'd have the card to bring me down
If she played it right
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack
She's got the jack
Poker face was her name
Poker face was her nature
Poker straight was a game
If she knew she could get you
She played 'em fast
And she played 'em hard
She could close her eyes
And feel every card
But how was I to know
That she'd been shuffled before
Said she'd never had a royal flush
But I should have known
That all the cards were comin'
From the bottom of the pack
And if I'd known what she was dealin' out
I'd have dealt it back
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, and who knows what else?
She's got the jack, yeah, yeah
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack
She's got the jack<start>I know your face, I know your smile and how it plays
into the minds of those who cling to every word you say.
This isn't how I wanted to remember me and you.
Your eyes are talking but your lips are standing still.
Open your mouth, tell me how I'm supposed to feel.
My finger pointing is just a warning so I suggest you...
Say you're wrong,
Lets get this over I would like to get some sleep tonight
Lets get this over, I'd like to get some sleep tonight,
Lets get this over. I'm done with all your lies.
You make it hard for me to leave, so very hard for me to leave.
By now the lies you told are weighing on your chest,
If I provide the rope I know you'll do the rest.
But I will not be an accessory, no I'm not who you think and I
will never be your enemy so don't insult me.
Say you're wrong,
This could be easier if I was over her,
So say you're wrong. (Say you're wrong)
I know she's just a girl but she's got me standing on the edge,
I'm on the edge of the world.
My eyes are open for the first time,
this planks not yours, it's in my own eye.
My eyes are open for the first time,
this planks not yours, it's in my own eye.
I am not a man who a life as soilders, but
I am not the kind of man who walks away.
I will stand face to face and toe to toe with anyone,
yes anyone.
Everything you said about me was the truth but I just don't think that I can look at you the same.
You're like a splinter that will never show its head to anyone, to anyone.
Now I know that I was not the man you wanted,
you know I loved you and I wanted to make you proud.
My intentions were to never give myself to anyone,
look what I've done.
Just look what I've done.
My intentions were to never give myself to anyone,
look what I've done.<start>Every time I stop I think of all the things we did
I can't put that book down now I'm face first on the ground
And every single day I tear up all the notes I had
Stick them back again just every now and....
I can't stop these raindrops, feel so shot
I know that you can live your life breathe the sights
I just might
How could you be dead again?
And out of mind and out of sight
I shut the door to everything
I want to see you cry And I'd wave you goodbye
The dirty kitchen sink
The cat still hasn't yet been fed
And your at home in bed I can't get you out of my.....
And I want you, you do too, feel it's true
But you don't understand
That I'm not gonna stop burning hot, feel so shot
How could you be dead again?
And I can never tell, could be heaven could be hell
I want to turn it off
I wish that I could stop and wipe it from my mind
Wash out all that's left behind
I could write a book, maybe you should have a look
I can't stop these raindrops, feel so shot
I know that you can live you life breathe the sights
I just might
How could you be dead again
And I want you, you do to feel it's true
But you don't understand that I'm not gonna stop burning hot
Could you be dead again<start>Drink this mercury
from my open hands
for I'm the breathing shadow
that keeps us alive
This grey sky turned to black
so many times honey.....
So stay with me tonight
hold my hands tonight
For I'm the smiling ghost
that binds our hearts together
Don't leave me tonight
For I have mercury that burns
Hold these hands of mine
Kiss these lips of mine
For I'm the mirror
that never lies<start>I know I can trust myself cause I believe in what I say
I believe in my friends, because they're with me everyday
Believe that we can overcome because the scene is strong today
Believe I live this life, because I know hardcore's the way
Believe we are right
Believe we are strong
Believe in yourself
Believe, hardcore
I know things look bleak sometimes I wish it wasn't that way
We know we're in the right, we stand proud today<start>Keep me past the gate
I've worn the world without a word
And I don't care too much for what they say
Grip my smothering end
Another day will pass again
Keep My fire alive for I'm not afraid
Can I make them understand
Who in the world would have thought this
God I'll never know your plans
Doin what i got to
What I Got to hang on
Cause I'm doin what I got to
What I got to hang on
Hanging on by a thread this is what I got
So hang on to this
Keep me pacified
The light will never see my face
For this must be a better place
Keep them entertained
I've lost the feel, I've lost the pain
For this seems to be a better place
Can I make them understand
Who in the world would have thought this
God I'll never know your plans
Doin what i got to
What I Got to hang on
Cause I'm doin what I got to
What I got to hang on
Hanging on by a thread this is what I got
So hang on to this<start>Well the sun is surely sinking down
But the moon is slowly rising
And this old world must still be spinning 'round
And I still love you
So close your eyes
You can close your eyes, it's all right
I don't know no love songs
And I can't sing the blues anymore
But I can sing this song
And you can sing this song
When I'm gone
Well it won't be long before another day
We're gonna have a good time
And no one's gonna take that time away
You can stay as long as you like
So close your eyes
You can close your eyes, it's all right
I don't know no love songs
And I can't sing the blues anymore
But I can sing this song
And you can sing this song
When I'm gone<start>Neon shines through smokey eyes tonight
It's 2 a.m. I'm drunk again
And it's heavy on my mind
I could never love again
So much as I love you
Where you end, where I begin
Is like a river running through
Take my eyes, take my heart
I need them no more
If never again I fall upon the one I so adore
(Chorus)
Excuse me please, one more drink
Could you make it strong
Cause I don't need to think
She broke my heart
My grace is gone
One more drink and I'll move on
One drink to remember
Then another to forget
How could I ever dream to find
Sweet love like you again
One drink to remember
Then another to forget
Excuse me please, one more drink
Could you make it strong
Cause I don't need to think
She broke my heart
My grace is gone
One more drink and I'll move on
One more drink and I'll be gone
You think of things impossible
Then the sun refuse to shine
I walk with you beside me
Your cold hand lay in mine
Excuse me please, one more drink
Could you make it strong
Cause I don't need to think
She broke my heart
My grace is gone
One more drink and I'll go
Excuse me please, one more drink
Could you make it strong
Cause I don't need to think
She broke my heart
My grace is gone
One more drink and I'll move on
One more drink and I'll be gone
One more drink my grace is gone

White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I want to riot
White riot, a riot of my own
Black man gotta lotta problems
But they don't mind throwing a brick
White people go to school

And nobody wants
To go to jail
White riot, I want to riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I want to riot
White riot, a riot of my own

Of people rich enough to buy it

Too chicken to even try it
And everybody's doing
Just what they're told to
And nobody wants
To go to jail

Todo lo que hay dentro de mi
Sacar toda esa sensibilidad
Que me acerque a ti
Que me lleve allÃ­
Y a pesar de todo me pregunto
Â¿quÃ© no di?
Y al vivir me oculto
Mis defectos para poder dormir
Ya nada volverÃ¡ a ser como antes
Nunca dejarÃ© que nada me cambie
Estaremos conociendo nuestra parte original
Ya nunca volverÃ¡ a ser como antes
Nunca dejarÃ© que nada me cambie
Estaremos conociendo nuestra parte de verdad
Tras una sombra gris
Que no me deja ver
PodrÃ© esperar que pase algo hoy
Con lo que tengo aquÃ­
Y no quiere salir
Y a pesar de todo me pregunto
Â¿quÃ© no di?
Y al vivir me oculto
Mis defectos para poder dormir<start>You are witty,funny
Frightening and bizarre
A mystery femme that no one knows by far
I'm in a trance
And you do your act
You're cool and confident
I'm lying in a pool of wet cement
I'm being trapped
I've lost control
Yet I'm turning the blind eye
All doubt swept aside
I know how faust did feel
When he cut his deal
And I just can't say why
I'm turning the blind eye
You choke my conscience
And my honesty
Yet I surrender unconditionally
Take what you want
Do what you will
'cause I'm turning the blind eye...<start>There's colors on the street
Red, white and blue
People shufflin' their feet
People sleepin' in their shoes
But there's a warming sign on the road ahead
There's lot of people sayin' we'd better off dead
Don't feel like satan, but I am to them
So I try to forget it, any way I can.
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
I see a woman in the night
With a baby in her hand
Under an old street light
Near a garbage can
Now she puts the kid away, and she's gone to get a hit
He hates her life and what she's done to it
There's one more kid that will never go to school
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
We got a thousand points of light
For the homeless man
We got a kinder, gentler,
Machine gun hand
We got department stores and toilet paper
Got styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people, says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

You love just drives me crazy, heaven knows
Why
So let me love you while, the moon's still high
Guarantee you we'll have a good time
Making love under the stars

Got the river Nile in my veins
And when you're with me, darling I could be
The white rabbit falling into space
Look at him go
I crazy 'bout you baby, my my my
You love just drives me cuckoo, heaven knows
Why
So let me love you while, the moon's still high
Let yourself go and have a good time
Making love under the stars
I see the lights dance when we're holding hands
It's like magic being with you
And when I'm dogged out, I still dream about
All the simple things that you do
All the little things<start>To the edge
Till we all get off
I will take you away with me
Once and for all
Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
Shower me into the same realm

Our embrace
Hold on (Come with me now)
Right away
Outer space with me
Once and for all
Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
Shower me into the same realm
Time will see us realign
Diamonds reign across the sky
I will lead us to the same realm
When the coffin shakes
And the needle breaks
Come right away with me
Come on you'll see

Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
Shower me into the same realm
Time will lead us to the same realm

Goodbye Sam hello Samantha
Sam, I'm leavin' the gang
So don't come around for me on Sunday.
Joe, I want you to know
I'll have to skip the game on Monday.
Had a whole lot of fun
But now the time has come
I need the sweet touch of a woman's love.
Goodbye Sam hello Samantha
Goodbye Joe hello Joanne.
Suddenly need a new kind of company
Someone to love me.
Goodbye Sam hello Samantha
Goodbye Lou hello Louise.
From today there'll be new games
For me to play
So good luck and goodbye Sam.
Guys you ought-a get wise
There's more to the world than pool and fishin'.
Easy ridin' is fine
But look around see what you're missin'.
Girls are waitin' in line
And now has come the time
I'm goin' out and I'm gonna get me some.<start>Since I'm putting down all of the true things around, but I like it
I handed down the crown, given the jewels and the answers of may
The thought of being ousted comes and goes
When I think about it the wind blows
I hate it
Run me out of town, somewhere a move might intended a gown at
Pissed at all the bowels, always the blues and a delicate smile
Missed all of the sideways, gull and noun
Chills and petty band-aids, wrapped around
I hate it
Good grief<start>[Andy:] hello.
[David:] yeah, is Andy there?
[Andy:] uh...this is he.
[David:] this is David Crowder calling for the interview that was scheduled today?
[Andy:] oh. Yeah. Great. Um sorry...I didn't expect you so soon.
Let me...give me a second to get things set up here.
[David:] no problem.
[Andy:] yeah. Made a few changes around here
and my typical setup is kinda, you know, technology's a killer right?
[David:] uh...well...we'll have to wait and see I guess.
[Andy:] well. Alright. Well. Umm. Well. Hey, let's get started.
Uh...sorry my notes are...you know a little scattered here...
uh...you'll have to forgive me.
[David:] mmhmm.
[Andy:] uhmm...I gotta admit I...I really don't know much about...
you know...you... You...or the band...
but I've got some friends that are big fans and um...
[David:] right.
[Andy:] but...uh...anyway...um...alright. Well. Ok. So here we go.
Um...so your new CD is titled a collision, or...um...3 + 4 = 7 that's..
that's interesting. You know the...the...
[David:] mmhmm.
[Andy:] ...whole double title thing.
[David:] yeah.
[Andy:] uhmm lets see...uh...and the atom on the cover that's pretty
[David:] uh huh.
[Andy:] cool. I was...I mean...I was never all that great in science and.
And math wasn't really my...my specialty...which is...which is I guess,
you know, why I'm a writer now. But uh...
[David:] mmhmm.
[Andy:] ...anyway um...
[David:] ok.
[Andy:] ok. So uh...it...I don't know...is that...it's like with the cover...
is that a metaphor or...uh...I mean is it metaphorical for something or like, or is it...
[David:] well...
[Andy:] ...just pretty or...
[David:] ...nah. Well I mean. Yeah.
The...uh...atom, it's not really...I mean it's a symbol.
You see that and you think atom.
It shows electrons moving in elliptical paths around a nucleus and all...we know...
[Andy:] mmhmm.
[David:] ...that's...that's not how an atom works. Or...or looks even, for that matter...
[Andy:] ok.
[David:] ...and so....and so that's why it was appropriate for the cover, you know...
[Andy:] right. Uhmm. Ok. Yeah. I'm not really sure I see the connection. But...
[David:] ...well...and what we mean to say is that the elements of worship are inadequate,
much like the atom depiction. But this is what we have you know?
It helps us carry the idea.
[Andy:] mmhmm. Mmhmm. Uhmm. Ok. Uh.
Tell...ok...what's the deal with these little songs between the real...you know, the real songs?
Like are they significant? Uhmm...is there like a theme of the album?
Or are they creating space? Like what's...going on there?
[David:] uhmm. I don't...
[Andy:] ok. Uhmm. So you know I hear there's this really spectacular ending to...
to the record is that true?
[David:] we'll have to wait and see on that.
[Andy:] swell.
[David:] it does swell.
[Andy:] wait...uh it...wait...hold on...it does well?
[David:] no. It swells.
[Andy:] oh. Right. It swells. Uhmm. Ok. Well.
And so the end starts with this...this piece called "the lark ascending."
Uhmm now what is...what is the lark?
Is that...is that also a metaphor for something?
[David:] uhmm. I gue...I mean I guess. I just...I don't think...
I don't think you should read too much into any of this you know
It's...I mean the lark ascending was written...
it was a piece written by Vaughn Williams who died in 1958,
and uh, the work opens with this calm set of sustained chords and then (coughs) sorry.
Excuse me. And uhmm.
Anyway and so then the violin enters as the lark and it...
it starts with this series of ascending and repeated intervals and this...
these nimble then elongated arpeggios. Uhmm.
And he actually found inspiration in a work by the English poet George Meredith
who died in 1909 and the composer included a portion of Meredith's poem on the flyleaf...
[Andy:] wait uh...
[David:] ...of the published work
[Andy:] ....hold on wait...
[David:] ...uhmm...
[Andy:] ...why do you keep mentioning...
[David:] ...and it...
[Andy:] ...the year they died?
[David:] ...well it went...and it went like this it says uh...
"He rises and begins to round,
He drops the silver chain of sound,
Of many links without a break,
In chirrup, whistle, slur and shake.
For singing till his heaven fills,
'Tis love of earth that he instills,
And ever winging up and up,
Our valley is his golden cup
And he the wine which overflows
To lift us with him as he goes.
Till lost on his aerial rings
In light, and then the fancy sings."
[Andy:] huh. Wow. That's nice. But I mean...but who is the lark?
[David:] I don't know.
[Andy:] sorry. I think i've got the wrong page. Uhmm.
The script you gave me says something different. It says, "you are."
[David:] yeah but I don't...
I don't feel like the lark much of the time and uhmm there are other larks for me you know?
[Andy:] wait a second. Ok. So correct me if I'm wrong but uhmm...
[David:] yeah.
[Andy:] ...in the script I have you're...
[David:] right.
[Andy:] ...making a point that art does this...
[David:] right.
[Andy:] ...you know the whole, it rises on wing from earth to fill the heavens...
[David:] yes.
[Andy:] ...pulling the rest of us with it. That as the lark rises so do we."
[David:] right. I'm unsure.
[Andy:] but. Uh. Hold on. I mean...it...it says so right here.
[David:] yeah. Uhmm. But the ground pulls at my feet.
[Andy:] hold...hold on just a second. Uh but I mean what about the number 7?
[David:] did you ever notice that the sky is all the way to the ground?
[Andy:] wait. Hold on. What?
[David:] we're walking around in it. We're in the sky.
There is sky and there is ground and we're somewhere in between.
That is where we live.
And sometimes some of us take wing and when they do,
when their feet leave the ground, even for a second,
they pull the rest of us with them.
And when we rise, and when we rise,
and when we notice that the sky has been around us all along.
We have been walking into it. It has been this constant collision.
Divinity and depravity.
And we rise and we rise and we rise and we rise and we rise
and we rise and we rise and we rise and we rise and we rise
and we rise and we rise and we rise and we rise...<start>I've never been kissed before
It's been on my list before
A flick of the wrist before would do
But when you get down to it
It's got a good sound to it
Don't meddle around with it
'Cause it's far too wet to woo
When Mummy and Daddy play
They tell me to go away
But by hanging around
I can learn all the rules
Now I got the technique
I'm away
Develop a taste for it
A time and a place for it
Although on the face of it, it's a crime
I've nibbled the cheese of it
The birds and the bees of it
Are weak at the knees
From making honey
Every time
I'm throwing my toys away
I'm leaving the boys to play
With the boys
Gimme girls
And it's time I was breaking away
Just gimme some head room
Just a little bit of head room
I need some leg room
Just a little bit of leg room
I see myself Oh Lord
I see a mess
I'm making a meal of it
I'm breaking the seal of it
I'm getting the feel of what to do
It's got a good ring to it
I'm getting a thing for it
And if there's a sting in it
I'll have met my Waterloo
My Mummy and Daddy said
You're liable to wind up dead
Oo, they've been shooting me a line
Maybe it doesn't exist at all
Oo, I've been towing the line
Now I'm hook line and sinkered
I've never been kissed before
It's been on my list before
A flick of the wrist before would do
But when you get down to it
It's got a good sound to it
Don't meddle around with it
'Cause it's far too wet to woo
I've thrown all my toys away
I'm leaving the boys to play
With the girls that you get
For a dollar a day
When you pull on their strings they say
Just give me some head room
Just a little bit of head room
I need a ball room
Up against the wall room
I need the rest Oh Lord
I need the rest
Just gimme some head room
Just a little bit of head room
Take me to your bed-room
Show a little bit of leg room
I need the rest Oh Lord
I need the rest
Just gimme some head room
Just a little bit of head room
I need some head room
Just a little bit of head room
I need the rest Oh Lord
I need the rest
Just gimme some head room
Just a little bit of head room
I need some head room
Just a little bit of head room
I need the rest Oh Lord
I need the rest<start>You lean forward to go
You pull back to go slow
These are the horse basics
You should know
There's no use to wait
A girl and her horse will never separate
You were done before
The gun at the starting gate
And away she rides
To the great unknown
You can wave goodbye
And spend some time on your own
And wonder why
Sometimes you find you fall far behind
On the course
Some things are best left
Between a girl and her horse
With no words to say
A girl and her horse can communicate
Cause motion is motion
And nothing's up for to debate
And away she rides
To the great beyond
You can wave goodbye
To a girl and her horse with a bond
You can't deny
Sometimes you find
You fall far behind on the course
Some things are best left
Between a girl and her horse
Sometimes you find
You can't cross the line on the course
Some things are best left
Between a girl and her horse
You lean forward to go
You pull back to go slow
The rest is anyone's guess
Don't you know
And away she rides
With the best in show
You can wave goodbye
A girl and her horse
Have a bond you'll never know
And away she rides
WIth the best in show you know
Unicorns don't exist of course
But every girl in this world has a horse
Sometimes you find
You fall far behind on the course
Some things are best left
Between a girl and her horse
Sometimes you find you can't cross
The line on the course
Some things are best left
Between a girl and her horse<start>Once my clothes where shabbie
Tailors called me cabbie
So I took a vow
Said this bummo bee bo borammo
Now I'm smooth and snappy
Now my tailors happy
I'm the cats meow
My wardrobe is a wow
Paris silk, Harris tweed
There's only one thing I need
Got my tweed press
Got my best vest
All I need now is the girl
Got my striped tie
Got my hopes high
Got the time and the place
And I got rhythm
Now all I need is the girl to go with 'em
If she'll just appear
We'll take this big town for a whirl
And if she'll say
My darling I'm yours I'll through away
My striped tie and my best dress tweed
All I really need is the girl
I start easy you see
Now I'm more deberner
And now I sell it here
How can she resist
And if she'll say
My darling I'm yours I'll through away
My striped tie and my best dress tweed
All I really need
Is the girl<start>Would you let me walk down your street
Naked if I want to
Can I fly fireworks on the fourth of every single July
Can I buy an amplifier on time
My sweet time
And I got no money
I will pay this time
And I got no money
I will pay you before I die.
And would you let me walk down your street
Naked if we all wanted to
Can I fly fireworks on the fourth of every single July
Can I fly an aeroplane way up high in all the sky
And I got no mercy
I will pay this time
And I got no mercy
I will pay you before I die.<start>At night they would go walking 'till the breaking of the day
The morning is for sleeping
Through the dark streets, they go searching, to see God in their own way
Save the nighttime for your weeping
Your weeping
Singing la lalalalala la la
And the night over London lay
So we rode down to the river, where the toiling ghosts spring
For their curses to be broken
We'd go underneath the arches, where the witches are in the saying
There are ghost towns in the ocean
The ocean
Singing la lalalalala la la
And the night over London lay
God is in the houses and God is in my head
And all the cemeteries in London
I see God come in my garden, but I don't know what he said
For my heart it wasn't open
Not open
Singing la lalalalala la la
And the night over London lay
Singing la lalalalala la la
There's no light over London today.<start>Sunshine came softly through my a-window today
Could've tripped out easy a-but I've a-changed my ways
It'll take time, I know it but in a while
You're gonna be mine, I know it, we'll do it in style
'Cause I made my mind up you're going to be mine
I'll tell you right now
Any trick in the book now, baby, all that I can find
Everybody's hustlin' just to have a little scene
When I say we'll be cool I think that you know what I mean
We stood on a beach at sunset, do you remember when?
I know a beach where, baby, a-it never ends
When you've made your mind up forever to be mine
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
I'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind
'Cause I made my mind up you're going to be mine
I'll tell you right now
Any trick in the book now, baby, all that I can find
Superman or Green Lantern ain't got a-nothin' on me
I can make like a turtle and dive for your pearls in the sea, yeah
A you-you-you can just sit there a-thinking on your velvet throne
'Bout all the rainbows a-you can a-have for your own
When you've made your mind up forever to be mine
I'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind
When you've made your mind up forever to be mine<start>Everyday I see your face from a picture on the wall.
I just sit by the phone and hope that someday maybe you'll call.
I remember the days, we slept so close it always felt so right.
Night after night how we held each other tight.
But morning comes and I'm all alone.
Cuz you're gone and you won't be back again.
Chorus:
Don't take your love
Don't take your love away from me
Don't take your love
Don't take don't take it away
Don't take your love
Nooo nooo
I couldn't keep up the pace
Seems I lost the race
and it's really got me down
cuz you're trying to run to every fancy place in town
pretty soon you're going to realize
when you do you're going to want me back again
Chorus:
Don't take your love
Don't take your love away from me
Don't take your love
Don't take don't take it away"<start>Sukie honey, we're gonna turn back the clock
To a time when we danced to volcanic rock
We loved to hunt and kill
That's how we used to be
We drank the blood we spilled
And growled at our enemies
Where were you when the monkey hit the fan
Thrill my gorilla
Where were you when monkey turned to man
Thrill my gorilla
Sukie honey, weren't you right there with me
I seem to remember chasing you from tree to tree
Those prehistoric nights are coming back to me
We must have been the first
To go down in history
Where were you when the monkey hit the fan
Thrill my gorilla
Where were you when monkey turned to man
Thrill my gorilla
We lay on our skins, original sins
Ah, ah, ah, ah yeah
We touch, we feel
We scream, we squeal
Thrill my gorilla
Thrill my gorilla
Where were you when the monkey hit the fan
Thrill my gorilla
Where were you when monkey turned to man
Thrill my gorilla<start>Farewell to arms so warm at night farewell to hands that could touch me just right
We had real love way back one time
That's all in the past so farewell to arms and eyes and lips that once were mine
Farewell to kisses made of fire farewell to eyes always filled with desire
I don't know how or where or when
It all went wrong so farewell to arms and eyes and lips that once were mine
Farewell to arms so warm at night farewell to hands that could touch me just right
We had real love way back one time that's all in the past so farewell to arms<start>Well I burnt all my travelers checks
Just to show you my respect
Then I hung myself out to dry
And you looked at me and asked me why
So I said I don't mind if I lose
'Cause if I win I'll be so confused
But that's not what you'd expect
From a man whose plan is already wrecked
And if you need to kiss me
Then you'll most definitely miss me
When I'm gone
Well there's a thousand things I shouldn't do
But if I do them I should do them with you
So won't you fall into my arms again
And hold me for the world may end
And if you need to kiss me
Then you'll most definitely miss me
When I'm gone
God, you make me sing
Funny things about you
You infect my mind
All the time, you do
Well I just can't contain myself In fact
I'm worried I might lose my health
I can't eat, sleep or hardly breathe
I can hardly ever watch you leave
And if you need to kiss me
Then you'll most definitely miss me
When I'm gone
God, you make me sing
Funny things about you
You infect my mind
All the time, you do<start>Come with me if you wanna see
Anything worth while
My child, I'll show you anything and everything
Go to heaven for the weather
But to hell to sell your soul
I'll show where mine went so long ago
[Chorus]
Teach you everything you need to know
The way to love and feel it in your bones
Grab the sheets and make her toes wrap up
Her lips respond
She wants you, oh
The more you listen to me
You'll see everything
That you need to be from me
I'll show you all that you need
To be the greatest lover to come after me
Oh, I can show, if you wanna know
Exactly how to say her name
To make her scream and shout
But not from pain
Ecstasy is all that you'll see
When you kiss her lightly
It's frightening
There is no room for smarts
Show her lightning
[Chorus]
I can't wait to see inside
See exactly what you're made of
I can see right through your eyes
See exactly where you came from
I'll take you out around the town
I will break you down
(I will break you down)
I'll leave you high and dry, girl
I'll make your body cry, girl
I'll make your body
Make your body
Make your body cry out
Teach you everything you need to know
The way to love and feel it in your bones
Grab the sheets and make her toes wrap up
Her lips respond
She wants you, oh
Come on, girl, and take a ride with me
Take your time and lose your need for speed
I'll take it slow and make you lose control
Your lips respond
I want you, oh
The more you listen to me
You'll see everything
That you need to be from me
I'll show you all that you need
To be the greatest lover to come after me (x2)<start>And this is where it ends after all this time, our time,
your promises, you put in your time and now you're moving on.
So we'll sever our ties and move our directions.
So this is where it ends and I know I can't abandon the past
and pretend that it never existed
because it meant the world to me, and it means the world to me.
I always thought our hopes and aspirations were considered one and the same.
I believe in the word integrity,
I believed in your integrity but, today I won't let it hold me back.
Your mark still burns so deep.
Today I'm moving on, your attitude you can keep.
And you say my feelings will pass in the days to come but,
they mean the world to me, and this means the world to me.
You had the choice of leaving, and yeah, you left your mark.
You don't understand integrity, you'll never understand integrity.
So just turn your back 'cause I'm doing the same.
We can both walk away from here with no more games.
It's so bad that it comes to this but, what did you expect?
All of my faith, my trust, my respect,
my time that I put into you, it's all through.<start>If you want my love
If you really do
If you want my love
If you really do
Have it have it
I want you to
And if you want my soul
If it's really true
Have it have it
Please do
No need to swear
How much you care
If you just couldn't care less
I hate when saying what we mean
When what we mean is the opposite
Don't ask me why if it weren't for my
Lack of confidence I would grow
Your are not the first girl in my life
But the first to let my feelings show
And if you want my love
If you really do
Have it have it
I want you to
Please do
No need to swear
How much you care
If you just couldn't care less
I hate when saying what we mean
When what we mean are opposites
Don't ask me why if I weren't so shy
I don't think I'd hesi - hesitate
Your are not the first girl in my life
But the first to make me feel this way
And if you want my love
If you really do
Have it have it have it have it
If you want my love
Baby have it
Please do<start>Words and Music: Mike Connell
And once said "please, some more"
And not even now and then.
Some place I know you swore
That you'd never go again.
I had this feeling once
That nothing was out of touch.
I found some comfort there
But that doesn't matter much.
And did we start digging around?
And did we start dragging around?
Be my burden
Christ, I'm certain I'm already bound.
I'm not ever quite together
I'm not sorted out.
You talked to me some more
And that was worth waiting for.
Sometimes I can't decide
If we're even half alive.<start>Two feet have I
Pillars of putrid meat
Standing so tall among my
Icons of filth
With gargoyle eyes
I see
The Christ he's smiling at me
His phosphorous grin
An absolution for all my sins
And in this room
The walls covered with flies
I'm seen through their myriad eyes
The alien eyes
I'm seen somewhere else
Seen through the windows of Hell
Few million light years from home
I am searching for a different kind of
Insanity
The Babylon astronaut
Could you leave it all behind?
(There is no evil)
I see the stars painted on the window's glass
Seven planets supporting the nothingness
And I am happy
Nothing more nothing less
(There is no evil)
Something came to my room
As flies on the ceiling
Coming down on me
One by one
And their hairy limbs
Crawling on my naked skin
The motherfuckers screwing on me
Insect sex
No
I won't move
As my ears are laden with eggs
Close my eyes
And dream of being back in the womb
"Under the juniper trees
Talking cats and silver boots filled with
Blood"
Could you leave it all behind?
Under another sun I'll grow saturnine
Lay siege to heaven in fever dreams
And I smash my head
Into the window's glass
And see the stars coming down at last<start>GO!
Long hair big lips
Little doll frame round her plastic tits
She's automatic super clean
Little bang baby all American dream
American dream
My little baby is electric on it
My little baby is a sex machine
My little baby does it just like I want it
My little baby is a sex machine
Start her motor Take your time
Rev her up slowly and pull the line
Are you ready you wanna play
Put your pedal to her metal
She'll blow you away
My little baby is electric on it

My little baby does it just like I want it

for going to sea
Hanno the Navigator said to me.
There's an open sky and a steady breeze
out beyond the Pillars of Hercules.
Above the foam-kissed waves seagulls scream
up in the masts of our trireme
and it's a good day
for going to sea
Hanno the Navigator said to me.
Water
Water
From horizon to horizon
All I see is water
Steer beyond all maps and charts
down along the coast of Africa.
The first Phoenicians on this beach,
where the monkeys gibber and the parakeets screech.
Strangest women run wild down there,
covered head to toe in fur and hair.
They fight like demons,
better let them be,
Hanno the Navigator said to me.
Water
Water
From horizon to horizon
All I see is water
When you pull close to your fire at night
with your family framed in the candlelight,
safe inside these walls of stone
in the only village you've ever known.
The rain-soaked moon plays splintered crystal
shadows on your windowsill.
Like sparks of light in the shifting skies,
our ancient ships go sailing still on
Water
Water
When my sailing days are done
I'll seek Poseidon's daughter.
Oarsmen pull and curse and sweat
underneath this creaking deck.
At night I hear their stories told,
strong through storms and weak for gold.
Carthage stands like an azure pearl
here in the middle of the known world.
And it's a good day
for going to sea,
Hanno the Navigator said to me.
Water
Water
From horizon to horizon
All I see is water.

she is walking home from a random dormroom
her arms are crossed she's staring at the ground.
Her hair's a mess it falls in her eyes and wearing what she wore last night
a sophomore and independent bound
there she goes again
she don't need a boyfriend
she's gonna have her fun
and never let it go to far
but she'll party like a rockstar
i saw her out dancing
she was teasing all the freshmen
they were trying to make their moves but getting shot down
glitter on her eyelids
in a lowcut t-shirt and miniskirt
catching ever look owning every room in a town
there she goes again
going out with her best friend
getting up on stage
to play a little air guitar
and under that strawberry skin
she don't need a boyfriend
she's gonna have her fun
and never let it go to far
but she'll party hard, she'll party like a rockstar
and she won't remember your name...
there she goes again
skipping class at 8 am
don't you fall for her
you'll be hangin on a broken heart
under that strawberry skin
she don't need a boyfriend
she's gonna have her fun
and never let it go to far
but she'll party hard, she'll party like a rockstar
she'll party like a rockstar
there she goes again<start>This is my last drink, I think I've had enough
Catch me as I sink
Ain't this amazing
It's pitiful to stop, it's beautiful
Oh you murder me
So savoured for what you really need
Let's say hello to always, always and I know
No-one shines like this
Coloured fingertips
Quiet rays of light
As you bat your eyes
You're all you are, you're everything
We're everything, it's everything to me<start>Opened up my heart
Start to feel again
Take another step
Now I understand
All the time I waited
All my faded plans
Every single tragedy was leading up to
someone that loves me like you
In a world full of broken promises
You were my portrait of truth
And suddenly I confess
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was you
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
All I ever needed
was you
It took a little pain
To find what I believe in
All I ever needed was you
Opened up my eyes
Finally I'm seeing it
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
was you
I ignored the stars
Each and every day
Don't give them credit cause
All they ever did was bring me pain
Waited for a love
I didn't have a name
You could call me crazy
But it's all I had to keep me sane
And out of the darkness comes light
and I feel like I'm staring at the sun
The shadow we cast feels so right
It took so many wrongs to find the way
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was you
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
All I ever needed
was you
It took a little pain
To find what I believe in
All I ever needed was you
Opened up my eyes
Finally I'm seein'
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
was you
(All I needed...was you)
I played a part
Acting like I knew just who you are
Traded every day that I can love
Anyone but you
I played a part
Acting like it's written in the stars
Loneliness was killing me enough
I said I can't make it through
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
It took a little pain
To find what I believe in
All I ever needed was you
Opened up my eyes
Finally I'm seeing it
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
was you
I told his heart not to leave or lie
It took so long just to realize
All I ever needed was you<start>if i stop and say that's it what would you do
if i lie down and quit and put and end to you
if i fall through that hole would you pick me up
if i lose my control and break your loving cup
if i fall through
if i fall through
if i love you too hard would you slow me down
if i crawl through your yard my face on the ground
if i fall through that hole mighty river below
if i lose my control would you not let go
if i fall through
if i fall through
(solo)
if i fall through
if i fall through
if i fall through
if i fall through<start>I'm going for a walk
Not the after dinner kind
I'm gonna use my hands
And I'm gonna use my mind
And who the hell are you to tell me what to do?
You can't even tie your own haggard shoes
Your closet is a mess, and your backyard's falling down
And I have no grand ideas or intentions of sticking around
I'm gonna build a world
Independent and exempt
All alone I'll be an empire
With no mortgage and no rent
And I don't need to live in your stinking zoo
You can't even feed the animals donated to you
Your storage sheds are ramshackled, flies decorate the walls
And you expect me to die here in this shit-filled tiny stall?
And I know you're watching! everything I do
Call me threat to your children call me socially unglued
Call me master of insanity, unable to relate
Call me lazy, bane, and filthy
Call me monstrous reprobate
I'm going for a walk and there's nothing you can do
'Cause I don't have to live like you
So I'm going for a walk<start>It's late and she is waiting, and I know I must go home,
But every time I start to leave, they play another song,
Then someone buys another round and whatever drinks are free,
What made Milwaukee famous has made a loser out of me.
Baby's begged me not to go, so many times before,
She said love and happiness can't live behind those swingin' doors,
Now she's gone and I'm to blame, too late I finally see,
What made Milwaukee famous has made a loser out of me.

She's got to learn to take her medicine
With a professional smile
Holy vessel or a toilet bowl
Puking hopes into a urinal
Sun like a blowtorch
Cuts through aluminum sky
Just like a crippled ballerina
In a pair of too tight slacks
It's on her face, expensive tastes
But no excess of ready cash
She's completely gone
Oh, but you know she'll be back
She's living on a question mark
But spending exclamation points
It's perjury right from the start
She's only whistling in the dark
Evidence is thin in her defense
And as the prosecution rests
The jury's out, the mood is tense
They're only whistling in the dark
So many ways the game could go
Timer ticks out minutes left
Until it's going to blow
She may stumble, but she won't fall
Waiting for the curtain call
As history repeats in motion slow
And though her repertoire is good
It's just a faded valentine
Between the hammer and the nails
There lies unspoken compromise
Then it strikes you
Right between the eyes<start>If we could fly

And you came to me
I would welcome you in

[instrumental]<start>I swear I feel you in the wind
Sinking deep beneath my skin
Every inch your fingers ever knew
Becomes a new way to feel close to you
And when the day is finally through
I close my eyes
And I realize
That it all comes back
To you
There's something crazy about your touch
I can never have too much
Hiding somewhere deep inside
The place where you and I collide
And when all the noise subsides
I close my eyes
And I realize
That it all comes back
To you
To you
To you
When everything you've ever known is
Falling out the sky
Where do you hide?
I'd never known a love like this
Til I finally messed it up right
And I closed my eyes
And I realized
That it all comes back
To you<start>There had always been the unearthly dark
of fathomless absence
until, from the south, came Muspellsheim's
inferno of flaring yellow flames.
And then, from the North, came Niflheim
where legions of freezing shadows lurked.
The abyss was crystalled by the Northern frost
that breath from the burning south made melt
and from this fusion there was made
the towering troll: immense Ymir.
From whose slain body's blood the sword of Odin
caused the oceans. And from whose carcass he claimed
the Earth. Man-trod Midgard was all his flesh.
From the bulk of the bones were the moountains made
and from his tangled hair: the trees.
His hollowed skull was hauled to form the vaulted sky
where the Gods assembled constellations;
in their cauldron Alchemized the sun.
To runic wands of task it turned until,
at last, the first veined-blade of grass had grown.<start>Verdammt, ich kann die Steine spÃ¼ren
Und doch den Rosenhimmel berÃ¼hren
Wollte niemals im Abseits stehen
Wo Menschen lachen, da tanzen Seelen
SchweiÃperlen glitzern nur auf ihrem Gesicht
Und diese Bilder, ich hass ihn nicht
Nehmt mich mit, lasst mich nicht, lasst mich nicht hier liegen
Lasst mich noch noch einmal die Welt verfÃ¼hren
Bei jedem Tanz, bei jedem Lied spÃ¼re ich
Was fÃ¼r mich wirklich wichtig ist
Bei jedem Zug, der um die HÃ¤user zieht
Merke ich, dass du mich nie vergisst
Verdammte Welt bleib wie du bist (Hey!)
Ich umarme, ich kÃ¼sse dich
Verdammte Welt alles ist gut so wie es ist
Verdammte Welt bleib wie du bist (Hey!)
Ich umarme, ich kÃ¼sse dich
Verdammte Welt dreh dich ein letztes Mal nur fÃ¼r mich
Nicht ganz selten mit schwachen Beinen stand ich
Mit mÃ¼den Augen und starrem Blick
Vor der PfÃ¼tze am Rathausplatz, dem Spiegel
Aus hellem Mond und meinem Dreck
GroÃe Augen im schmalen Kessel
Starrten dennoch nicht nach Rom
Mein Leben war Ã¼berall wo Lichter schienen
Und die scheinen auch in SÃ¼dtirol
Verdammte Welt bleib wie du bist (Hey!)
Ich umarme, ich kÃ¼sse dich
Verdammte Welt alles ist gut so wie es ist
Verdammte Welt bleib wie du bist (Hey!)
Ich umarme, ich kÃ¼sse dich
Verdammte Welt dreh dich ein letztes Mal nur fÃ¼r mich
Tanz im Kreis, tanz im Kreis und um die eigene Achse
Dreh dich bitte noch mal nur fÃ¼r mich
Sing und lach, zieh mit mir noch einmal um die Sonne
Wer gewinnt? Ich bin es nicht
Tanz im Kreis, tanz im Kreis und um die eigene Achse
Dreh dich bitte noch mal nur fÃ¼r mich
Keine Ahnung, keinen Plan, wer zuletzt noch steht
ScheiÃegal, was kÃ¼mmert's mich?
Verdammte Welt bleib wie du bist
Ich umarme, ich kÃ¼sse dich
Verdammte Welt alles ist gut so wie es ist
Verdammte Welt bleib wie du bist (Hey!)
Ich umarme, ich kÃ¼sse dich
Verdammte Welt dreh dich ein letztes Mal nur fÃ¼r mich
Ach weiÃt du, bleib doch einfach wie du bist (Hey!)
Ich umarme, ich kÃ¼sse dich
Gehasst, geliebt, verdammte Welt
Alles ist gut so wie es ist
Ach bitte, bitte bleibe so wie du bist (Hey!)
Ich umarme, ich kÃ¼sse dich
Verdammte Welt, dreh dich ein letztes mal nur fÃ¼r mich (Hey!)<start>Safe little house, safe little friends,
Safe little thoughts to keep you safe
From all those big bad wolves that eat you up.
(oh shit)
Safe in your room,
Safe as a tomb,
Sleep in a coffin made of glass.
It takes a big facade to hide your cries?
Can you make this last?
Cause now I'm not so sure,
Are you up to the task?
Sometimes the sickness is the cure.
You're searching so hard,
You've lost yourself
Does it help to pray as you're wasting away
Like a silver screen cliche?
Cause after all we're actors on a stage.
(oh oh, oh oh. oh oh, oh oh)
Will it help you to wait for the moment to break,
Is it real or is it fate?
All we are chapters on a page.
(oh oh, oh oh. oh oh, oh oh.)
Cause after all we're actors on a stage.
Hearing you now, shedding the doubts
They'll be no past or future tense.
Regrets a waste of time and plans change.
(will always change)
Oh, some for the worst,
Some for the best,
You know you can always get your way.
So worried about what's next,
You lost today.
(You lost today)
Can you make this last?
Cause now I'm not so sure,
Are you up to the task?
Sometimes the sickness is the cure.
You're searching so hard,
You've lost yourself
Does it help to pray as you're wasting away
Like a silver screen cliche?
Cause after all we're actors on a stage.
(oh oh, oh oh. oh oh, oh oh)
Will it help you to wait for the moment to break,
Cause it really isn't fate.
All we are just chapters on a page.
(oh oh, oh oh. oh oh, oh oh.)
Cause after all we're actors on a stage.
Can you let yourself,
Can you let yourself,
Will you let yourself let go?
Let go.
Can you let yourself,
Can you let yourself,
Won't you let yourself?
Just let yourself let go.
Let go.
Safe little house, safe little friends,
Safe little thoughts to keep you safe.
Does it help to pray as you're wasting away
Like a silver screen cliche?
Cause after all we're actors on a stage.
(oh oh, oh oh. oh oh, oh oh)
Will it help you to wait for the moment to break,
Is it real or is it fate?
All we are chapters on a page.
(oh oh, oh oh. oh oh, oh oh.)
Does it help you to play as you faded away,
Like a memory?
Cause all we are just actors on a page.
And after all, we're actors on a stage.<start>Her treasure chest was sunken

me and my boys are synchronized.
Like a little explosion in what's left in my brain,
telling me to move while the world's insane.
Put on a record on the stereo,
I loose myself and before i know the choir goes.
Us dead end kids got a place to go,
we take our home with us where we go.
I'll sit hours on end and I dream and pretend,
can almost feel the hot spotlights.
And all those nights up on the stage,
man I never wanna leave that place to go.
Here I feel alright.<start>Woke up this morning, my baby's gone
Woke up this morning, my baby's gone
I ain't had no loving since my baby been gone
I ain't got nobody to stay at home with me
I ain't got nobody to stay at home with me
I wonder 'bout my baby, what's gonna happen to me
My baby's gone, gone away from me
My baby's gone, gone away from me
My whole life is in misery
My baby's gone, gone away from me
My baby's gone, gone away from me
And now I'm worried that you can see<start>Today I started home with just a mile ago
And everythin' was goin' on right
And then I heard sock it to me on the radio
And I'll never make it home tonight
Well I made it down on the old crossroad
Where the wrong road leads to the right
Then I thought of many in the mini skirts
And I'll never make it home tonight
Yeah the road to the right is wrong, the one to the left is right
I'ma lookin' for the right place to go wrong
And I'll never make it home tonight
Yeah the road to the right
Down in the glad place for the sad
I'm losin' for I'm gonna get fight
I'ma lookin' for good place to go bad
And I'll never make it home tonight
Well I got kinda high and live a little low
Started home about daylight
When I got to the road where I should've get
Left again I turn to the right
Yeah the road to the right
Yeah the road to the right
Yeah it don't look like
I'm gonna make it home tonight<start>I met a girl named Tara she lived in the heart of America
She liked black caddies listened to puff daddy
Danced until her legs were sore
She worked around the corner at a diner with a grouchy owner
And her boyfriend, shady, dates another girl named Katie
He loves her definitely maybe
Don't think I can take it wake me when it's over so far away
I wish that it was closer I see her every day
I'm too scared to go over I wonder what she'd say
I barely even know her
And how much longer will this keep getting stronger
I wonder what she's doing when I'm singing myself to sleep
'Cause he's a faker so see ya later
I wonder when you'll realize that she means a lot more to me
I saw you in the hallway when my last class was just over
It was Friday, school was out tonight everything seems to be alright
I said yo are you going to the party at the cove
She said he's picking me up six again
And I don't wanna disappoint my boyfriend
And how much longer will this keep getting stronger
I wonder what she's doing when I'm singing myself to sleep
'Cause he's a faker so see ya later
I wonder when you'll realize that she means a lot more to me
And she's staring at his picture hanging in her locker
She's telling all the girls about all the things that he bought her
I saw what really happened all those times he went for water
When we were at the movie theater watching harry potter
He had his hands on
Every single girl he laid his eyes on to break it to you, hes a pile on
And even when he kissed her he was looking over, staring at her sister
And how much longer will this keep getting stronger
I wonder what she's doing when I'm singing myself to sleep
'Cause he's a faker so see ya later
I wonder when you'll realize that she means a lot more to me
I met a girl named Tara, she lived in the heart of America
She liked black caddies, listened to puff daddy
Danced until her legs were sore<start>we're gonna fight it till the end and we won't be beat down again
your culture's fed into our veins, your preaching tyranny and hate
to follow in your footsteps would be hypocracy
so now's the time to fight for our beliefs

are we the only ones here who won't judge you by your skin?
are we the only ones here who know together we can win?

There's a face in every window,watching every move I make

Take a look around you and you find out where you are
Walking on the edge

Hear the engines gunning in the middle of the traffic
Caught up in the jam again

No need to worry it's ok

Again...<start>Sweet Tuesday morning
You came and you smiled
And all of my fears,
They have left me
Sweet Tuesday morning
You came and you smiled
And love is the answer you gave me
I've been to places all around, astound me
I've seen the breaking of the souvenirs
I'm in a brightness I can feel surround me
And it's the first time I've felt it for years
Sweet Tuesday morning,
You came and you smiled
And love is the answer you gave me....mm-mhm<start>Gaze at the sky
And picture a memory
Of days in your life
You knew what it meant
To be happy and free
With time on your side
Remember your daddy
When no one was wiser
Your ma used to say
That you would go further
Than he ever could
With time on your side
Think of a boy with the stars in his eye
Longing to reach them but frightened to try
Sadly, you'd say, someday, someday
But day after day
The show must go on
And time slipped away
Before you could build
Any castles in spain
The chance had gone by
With nothing to say
And no one to say it to
Nothing has changed
You've still got it all to do
Surely you know
The chance has gone by
Think of a boy with the stars in his eye
Longing to reach them but frightened to try
Sadly, you'd say, someday, someday
But day after day
The show must go on
And you gaze at the sky
And picture a memory
Of days in your life
With time on your side
With time on your side
(Day after day, the show must go on)
With time on your side
(Day after day, the show must go on)
With time on your side
(Day after day, the show must go on)
With time on your side

Is everyone in place? Let's open the curtains
But before you go on, let me ask you this question
Does a voice make a sound if there's no one to listen?
And as it started she said, I may just be guessing
But somewhere in the feedback must be a message
We'll stay just for today
Together we say, you're not alone
With all these choices
We all live with, you're not alone
Miles away, I can't hear myself think
Just one more shot to help make the pain sink
And another rest stop, another last phone call
Forgot to say happy anniversary
And I can't hear the noise, I'm used to these engines
It's gotten to the point, I can't hear anything
We will stay just for today
Together we say, you're not alone
With all these choices
We all live with, you're not alone
But it's all fading fast, fun while it lasted
This mountain of dust, this hard rain of ashes
But if something was done to give us this problem
Then somewhere there are those who know how to solve them
We will stay just for today
Together we say, you're not alone
With all these choices
We all live with, you're not alone
Just for today
Together we say, you're not alone

Sono uscita dalla stanza davvero molto irritata

lo sguardo di un uomo mi fagocitava
quello squallido albergo di certo non era una bella esperienza

You are the one when I'm in doubt
That everything will work out for the best 'cause you see
Are we, staying close enough
Found me, (you) found me at the start
Time we, time we moved along
I wanted to find what you're waiting for
When everything I know still is yours
I know that I'll find what you're looking for<start>Make it a sweet, sweet goodbye - it could be for the last time and it's not right.
"Don't let yourself get in over your head," he said.
Alone and far from home we'll find you
Dead like a candle you burned out;
Spill the wax over the spaces left in place of angry words.
Scream to be heard, like you needed any more attention;
Throw the bottle, break the door, and disappear.
Sing me to sleep, I'll see you in my dreams, waiting to say, "I miss you. I'm so sorry."
Forever's never seemed so long as when you're not around it's like a piece of me is missing.
I could have learned so much from you but what's left now?
Don't you realize you brought this family a world of pain?
Can't you see there could have been a happy ending we let go?
Sing me to sleep, I'll see you in my dreams, waiting to say, "I miss you. I'm so sorry."<start>Words and music by bob seger
Headin' out on some uncharted path
You soon turn back

You never seem to reach the end
Someone's out there on the street tonight

Beaten by the wind
Every time I turn around he's there again

But you never bleed
You never feel the need
Everybody casts a certain light
A special gift
It's theirs to use for wrong or right

We take no risks
We figure out which games to play
And how to make 'em pay

Skies have all turned grey
Suddenly the storm is heading straight your way

You charge 'em at full speed
You cover up - you hear the shattering glass
But you never bleed
You face a full force gale
An american storm
You're buried beneath a mountain of cold

If you'll be in my dream
Still you are so far away from me
So far away from me
My love for you is a sin
If you're not there I never have been
Yeah you are so far away from me So far away from me
I don't have all of the time in the world
But all of the time that I have It is yours
All of the time that I have It is yours
You're so high dancing on your clouds
And I'm down here with this tired old hound
Yeah you are so far away from me
So far away from me
Close my eyes gently
Hold and caress me
My heart is empty
With you so far away from me
So far away from me
I don't have all of the time in the world
But all of the time that I have It is yours
All of the time that I have It is yours
I don't have all of the time in the world
But all the time that
I have It is yours All the time that I have It is yours<start>Safe... Only for you
On the edge of the dark
Where no one can find you
Breathe... extinguish the spark
Are you hiding from something
No self... Reflecting in scene
When I feel you lost inside me
darkness blinds me now that I feel you, i've
Now that I feel you, I
Exit the empty
exist... where nothing was found
where no one can find me
i'll go... softly without a sound
will I find you lost inside me
silence i'll be
now that I feel you, I
now that I feel you, I...
Drifting inside
Closing my eyes
Till the pain died
given in to you
I've given in to you, I...
...feel you now...
And I feel you, I...
You...
I feel you... I...
Feel you, I....
*This is the bit where Clint sings REALLY high like an angel!*
Feel you.......
Now I have gone in to you
All that remains I know....
Is the silence thats filling me now..
Can you hear me..... NOW!
Empty Craving???
Filling Silence..<start>I was living on the edge of a knife
I was my biggest threat to my life
I can't believe it when I look back now
Always seemed to make it through somehow
Some money in my pocket and leaving on my mind
I've tried to leave those skeletons behind
Those rattling bones wake me in the night
Got to find a way to put things right
Driving all nigh but I'm not there
Sign on the road says I'm going nowhere
I ask myself what have you got to lose
2 Fists full of nothing-which one do you choose
If I keep on driving till the darkness fades
Will it take some of this guilt away
A new day's rising and nothings changed
On the highway of life in the breakdown lane
I feel it inside just like a burning flame
The eyes in the mirror show nothing but pain
How long can one mans bad luck last
And can you really out run your past
I feel it inside just like a burning flame
The eyes in the mirror show nothing but pain
How long can one mans bad luck last
And can you really out run your past<start>Vanities are only charity
And she makes donations at the Tiffany's,
Life is hard without a credit card to get by, get by
She sold her dreams for security
To a man that now she hardly ever sees
With a cold martini in her hand, she don't mind, don't mind
So throw all your luxuries aside
You can't take them with you when you die
Still when I look into your
Eyes are full of dollar signs
Oh, reach, into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don't matter if you fail
You're too scared to try cause you might break a nail, oh
If you design a plastic happiness,
Then climb the social ladder to the top my friend,
And don't forget to thank the piggy bank in the sky, so high
So throw all your luxuries aside
You can't take them with you when you die
Still when I look into your
Eyes are full of dollar signs,
Oh, reach, into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don't matter if you fail
You're too scared to try cause you might break a nail
Oh, reach, into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don't matter if you fail
You're too scared to try cause you might break a nail, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Oh, reach, into a pocketful of dreams

Ain't that aight, man

The bartender's tripping and ya girl is looking at me
Typical, tropical heat, chewing gum on ya seat
Yeah, this happening sucks, yes indeed
Tell me, what's da reason, yo
Why do you came? Why do ya blame?
The band is giving everything
Oh, now you say that it's too loud
Do you think that it is silent when you shout?
Tell me, why da fuck are you here?
(Oh yeah)
You wanna criticize me? Yeah, I can feel it in the air
Adrenaline is rising, homes, yo
Ya anger is my air to breathe and I can feel it in my bones

It's a stick up, it's a stick up, fuck)
Yo, I hear ya screaming for payback, bitch
But I have to disappoint you
'Cause I don't swing tec's or baseball bats
So I guess ya skills gotta be the weapon to choose for you
And I won't explain da rules to times for you
Wake up early, son, first come first serve
Speak your shit but always keep something in reserve
The crowd wants to be entertained
So what'cha gonna be, B boy? A B boy or a stain

the feel of the tires
your hands on a wheel and the smell from the fires
streetlights and headlights on a road that goes nowhere
she left you, she left you but you know she's still out there
and somehow it always seems like you are waiting for something
and somewhere they're dancing the night away madly
and their sweat fills their eyes as they're clutching so sadly
so you struggled for words you could never find somehow
but there's nowhere to hide coz the secrets's out now
out now
out now
it's out now
out now
somehow it always seems like you would wake up from a dream
she never knew you
she only knew what she heard
so just once you'd pull her close
and you'd whisper the words
but you hated yourself
for the things that you gave her
but you stole with your mind
when your heart was impure
so you think you'll forget
all these nights like a sickness
and there's nothing for miles
everywhere in the darkness
but somewhere they're dancing the night away madly
and the tears fill your eyes as you clutching her sadly
and you searched in yourself
but could not find an answer
now the feeling grows inside of you like a cancer
and roar the engine on a road that's just endless
and her ghost is with you everywhere in the darkness
you struggled for words you could never say somehow
but there's nowhere to run coz the secret's out now
out now
out now
it's out now
out now
somehow she always knew<start>So I wait my turn, I'm a modern man
And the people behind me, they can't understand
Makes me feel like
Makes me feel like
So I wait in line, I'm a modern man
And the people behind me, they can't understand
Makes me feel like
Something don't feel right
Like a record that's skipping
I'm a modern man
And the clock keeps ticking
I'm a modern man
Makes me feel like
Makes me feel like
In my dream I was almost there
And you pulled me aside and said you're going nowhere
They say we are the chosen few
But we're wasted
And that's why we're still waiting
On a number from the modern man
Maybe when you're older you will understand
Why you don't feel right
Why you can't sleep at night now
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man
Oh I had a dream I was dreaming
And I feel I'm losing the feeling
Makes me feel like
Like something don't feel right
I erase the number of the modern man
Want to break the mirror of the modern man
Makes me feel like
Makes me feel like
In my dream I was almost there
But you pulled me aside and said you're going nowhere
I know we are the chosen few
But we're wasted
And that's why we're still waiting
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man
And you feel so right
But how come you can't sleep at night?
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man
I'm a modern man

To be alone
I want arms around
I want arms around
It'll be all right
You can be sure
Don't crease that perfect curvature
Soul pirate, drifting in a sea of bliss (oh)
Soul pirate, get your headgear around this (wooawoo wooawoo wooawoo-oh)
Don't close the door
Into your heart
I want arms around
I want arms around
If what you want, ain't what you get.. intoxicating silhouette
Soul pirate, drifting in a sea of bliss (oh)
Soul pirate, get your headgear around this (wooawoo wooawoo wooawoo-oh)
So all you grieve, 'cause your own hope and exile
Will emphasise your livewire
Sophisticated, daring it matters what you're wearing
The likes of Mr Brummell we will not see again
To polish the soles of your shoes with bouvac and champagne
You let her go three whole times
I want arms around
I want arms around
Just be yourself, embodied emphasis
Just wave that spangled wand of yours and glamour is!
Soul pirate, drifting in a sea of bliss(oh)
Soul pirate, get your headgear around this(wooawoo wooawoo wooawoo-oh)
Get you headgear around this
Get you headgear around this

It's rolling round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when,
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Anton...
When I was just a baby my mama told me
"Son, always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
Now every time I hear that whistle I hang my head and cry...
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a movin'
And that's what tortures me...
Well if they'd free me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move just a little further down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away...<start>It's time we stood up for ourselves so get up off your knees.
We'll shake off our detractors and attain our hopes and dreams
and if we fall prey to in-fighting, we're never gonna win,
so put aside your differences, sing loud, sing proud
We won't listen to their stories or be waylaid by their lies
it's a dram that's still attainable for kids like you and I
So if we all stand together singing one defiant song
our voice will reach the heavens, so sing with all your heart
Join us in a song
we shall rise and sing stand up and be counted
sing a song for liberty join us in this song
together we shall sing rise up and be counted
sing it loud, sing it proud
We've been brutalized and crucified, the brunt of their attacks,
is corruption not their trademark and compassion what they lack?
If we can realize our common goals,
the end of which is plain united and now stronger,
their loss is now our gain!<start>"So, Greavsie, well, what about the black lads gettin' bananas thrown at em?"
"Well, it seems a bit unfortunate, I mean, uh, uh"
Sitting on the bench, he starts another drink
Drowning his sorrows watching Geoff Hurst's hat-trick
The pressures of success led him to the bottle
Now famous for his drinking, when once it was his football
Now a TV personality, I see him every week
If only he was as clever with his mouth
As he was with his feet
"The songs about critical, what you think about that"
"I'm not saying, I mean, it seems a bit unfair on me, I mean I've only had me breakfast"
"Ah ha ha, you'll be the death of my, Greavsie"<start>'Cause you're so evil and I'm so good
I'll make it up to you some day<start>I'm gettin' up soon in the mornin'
I believe I'll dust my broom
I'm gettin' up soon in the mornin'
I believe I'll dust my broom
I quit the best girl I'm lovin'
Now my friends can get in my room
I'm gonna write a letter
Telephone every town I know
I'm gonna write a letter
Telephone every town I know
If I don't find her in Mississippi
She be in East Monroe I know
And I don't want no woman
Wants every downtown man she meets
No, I don't want no woman
Wants every downtown man she meets
Man, she's a no good
Honey
They shouldn't allow her on the street, yeah
I believe, I believe my time ain't long
I believe, I believe my time ain't long
I ain't gonna leave my baby
And break up my happy home<start>Life it seems so great but they all don't last
Seasons change so fast and we're catching up
There's nothing in this world that's bound to last
Clouded thoughts of memories are all I have
Living in between words can be so sad
There's nothing so great compared to what we have
[Chorus]
I won't wait for tomorrow or living all back in the
past
I'll hold on to what is real to what we have
Come with me and we will sail away from here
Ask the oceans to drown all the pain within
There's so much love to share, a love so dear
[Chorus]
I won't wait for tomorrow or living all back in the
past
I'll hold on to what is real to what we have
x2
*Instrumental*
[Chorus]
I won't wait for tomorrow or living all back in the

I'll hold on to what is real to what we have
x2

I'll hold on to what is real to what we have<start>If there's anything I can do just tell me I'll be there
I need someone to help me, start breathing in clean air
Sick of feeling cloudy and not having any clues
If you want to tell me, if there's something I can do
Sick of feeling lonely, and not having any clues
If you want to tell me, if there's something I can do, do
I think you're fuckin' crazy just staring into space
But that's the price you've got to pay for losing the big race
Didn't need to line up, but you took your starting blocks
Couldn't stand there quiet, when your mouth is spitting rocks
Didn't need to line up, but you took your starting blocks
Couldn't stand there quiet, when your mouth is spitting rocks
And I'll help you sort it out, the very best I can
Throw out all your nightmares, put you on cloud 9
The only thing you have to do is make sure you got a mind, a mind
And I'll help you sort it out, the very best I can
Throw out all your nightmares, put you on cloud 9
The only thing you have to do is make sure you got a mind, a mind
And I'll help you sort it out, the very best I can
Throw out all your nightmares, put you on cloud 9
The only thing you have to do is make sure you got a mind, a mind<start>Totally, completely
Entirely amazing
That the unseen has become seen
And is to me unfailing
You are the Lord, the Father of lights
You are God the Keeper of my heart
And I praise You, and I praise You
You are the lover of my soul
You are the giver of the second start
And I praise You for who You are
Seems too high for me to reach
To wrap my mind around the mystery
That who You are so constantly
Is who you're making me to be<start>Written by: Ben Taylor, Larry Ciancia, Joel Shearer, Chris Chaney & Zac Rae
Rain, your powers are astounding
When I lift this shell to my ear
I can hear your voice crying out
Rain, your magic's all around me
When you bring the heavens down
I can fly until I dry out
Maybe I'm only dreaming
Maybe I'm only foolish
Maybe I'm only deceiving myself and I'm not really ready to do this.
Rain, come down upon my ceiling
Wash my sorrow for me until I find some sleep
Jay, come haunt me while I'm healing
Remind tomorrow for me so I can get some peace
Maybe I'm only dreaming
Maybe I'm only foolish
Maybe I'm only deceiving myself and I'm not really ready to do this.
Rain, your voice is like the water
Wash your wisdom on me
Until my mind is free
I can see
All you have to do is to believe
Maybe I'm only dreaming
Maybe I'm only foolish
Maybe I'm only deceiving myself and I'm not really ready to do this.<start>If dust could only talk
What would we hear it say?
Before it's brushed aside
Just as it's swept away
It's just the evidence
It's of no consequence
It's only flesh and bone
Why don't you leave it alone?
If dust could only speak
Caught in a falling beam
If dust could only cry
If dust could only scream
For it's the single witness that might testify
Could I spit out the truth?
Or would you rather just swallow a lie?
But dust is always caught behind a coat of paint
Beneath the marble fingernails of kings and saints
And in the theater curtain where they hang a drape
And in the ticket pocket where your hands escape
Before they start to wander
And they start to shrink
You rub your eye a little and appear to blink
And then she caught you staring
She knows just what you're thinking
What got into you was not a ghost as such
It was just dust
Here comes the juggernaut
Here come the poisoners
They choke the life and land
And rob the joy from us
Why do they taste of sugar
Oh, when they're made of money
Here come the lamb of God
And the butcher's boy, Sonny
Well I believe we just
Become a speck of dust
Well I believe we just
Become a speck of dust
Well I believe we just
Become a speck of dust<start>I'm gonna quit 'cause it's getting old
And it'll save my life or so I've been told, yeah

But if it's what you want I guess, I'll try

I'm losing friends, I'm losing face, I'm losing weight
So get your things out of my place on Saturday
On Saturday, on Saturday, on Saturday
I can't find my key, I know where it went
Straight out the door with half the rent
But I got this song that I like to sing
And you can keep the key, I'll keep the ring
We're breaking up, you're moving out on Saturday
I'm losing friends, I'm losing face, I'm losing weight
So get your things out of my place on Saturday
On Saturday, on Saturday, on Saturday
And she said, "It's not you, I just need my space"
On Saturday, on Saturday, on Saturday
I said, "It is me, just say it to my face"
On Saturday, on Saturday, on Saturday
All in time, it will be fine
Just me, myself and I sublime
All in time, it will be fine
Just me, myself and I sublime
We're breaking up, you're moving out on Saturday

They lived in fear and had a hard stand
In the distance beyond the sundown
Down to the world of purgatory
Holy night, the cry of the angels
They chose the one, the one to kill the king
They'd been living in a nightmare
In a world of hate and full of despair
Take the crown
And take your life in your own hands
Drawbridge down
The night of the demon dance
Take the crown
We're fighting united
Turn it down
Down to the ground
On and on they fought till dawn
The chosen lords of doom
Going down down down the knights are around
Till the rising of the moon
No more living in the shadows
Released from grace and the bell it tolls<start>I get up early in the morning
And rush to catch a plane
I'm going to live inside my suitcase
Back on the road again
Big stage and bright lights
Try to relax before the show
So glad to be here tonight
That I just can't wait to go, I gotta go
Welcome home
Welcome home
Welcome home
It feels good
I'm going to save up all of my money
Just to see if I could
Try to brighten my appearance
With clothes from Hollywood
We're climbing up the music ladder
The girls won't leave us alone
But it really doesn't matter
If we're nothing back home, back home
Welcome home
Welcome home
Welcome home
It feels good
Welcome home
Welcome home
Welcome home
It feels good
So glad we left the praire city
And now we're living on the coast
We went and got ourselves a manager
We all think he's the most
Silver 'vette with gold wheels
We see him cruise around town
No, he's never really up
No, he's never really down down, he's just mojo
Welcome home
Said welcome home baby
Ah, welcome home
It feels good
Welcome home
So good to drive in your own car with your old lady
Said welcome home
Welcome home
So good to see you again
Welcome home baby
So good to sleep in your own bed
Ooh whoo, feels good<start>Sunlight loves me, feeds me milk and honey
Daytime misses me, feeds me milk and honey

Jack jump over the candle stick
Sunlight loves me, feeds me milk and honey
Daytime misses me, feeds me milk and honey
Can't stop thinkin, bout my own breathin
Everytime I wake up I feel<start>how'd you get this number? Get my name from a paper?
Are you calling here behalf yourself or for somebody else?
You lookin for my leader? Or just some company?
Getting pleasure outta pushing buttons listening to the ring
A face unknown, a name unknown, so where you calling from in this galaxy
A telecasted message via moon beam waves
From satellite to satellite to the fossils of today
I can hear you breathing but I cannot comprehend
This galaxy of words that you're tryna send
who's that? Who's that? Who's that on the other end? (4x's)
I'm picking up a signal from a nebula system
Maybe interference from an earth man station
It's irritation, a mystery to me
Struggle on my mind to see what I can see
Could it be a long lost friend on the other end?
Could it be an enemy wishing me the end?
Could it be a resident of the solar wind?
Now you got me wondering who's on the other end?
Who's that? Who's that? Who's that? Who's that?<start>Kids at play underneath the light of day.
Theres something in the way that you look,
They're never going to expect whats in store for them.
And I recall, you were just a new born soul,
Tanning in the open sky.

I've watched you change from spring to winter.
Watched the sun drown out of the sky like it never was there.

Now that you vanished.
I see you the best.

The truth is I lied
I should have been more careful
With your tender heart
When I said all those mean things
Words that tore you apart
Like I don't want you, I don't need you
I didn't mean it, it was only my pride
When I said, I don't love you
The truth is I lied<start>Here we go round and round
State your case and then sit down
Tell me why you want to go
I don't love you anymore
Here you go mad again
Tell me that your just a friend
Tell me something I don't know
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
Yeah
When I do go, I'll let you know
It might hurt you, but I don't think so
Here we go round and round
State your case and then sit down
Tell me why you want to go
I don't love you anymore [Repeat: x3]<start>Ten feet high
I can't fly and
Stand on
Facedown
Can't be gone
Fell for ???
Missing my luck
I have figures of Virgin Mary
I can't stop my fall
For your eyes
Not for an hour
And not for your smile
Please don't be late
'Cause you know I can't wait
And don't blame
And be insane!<start>Sometimes you're dressed in Castillian vogue
Other times you speak with a faux (false ?) Scottish brogue
Ruthless, relentless, pursuing your defenseless quarry
Now you say you've been following me through my lives and deaths
From the very first tears to the last failing breaths
You clean up the mess, you say "I must confess" you say "I'm sorry"
Some say they've seen you outside of my door
On dark, rainy nights when the light is so poor
Maybe they're mistaken, or maybe you're just faking evidence
They think you're a man with the body of a libertine
Skin that's so white, clean daylight has never seen
I wonder if you're punishment, or prison or just providence
You say "Why, why, why
Why, why, why
Why, why, why
Don't you love me?"
How you danced with the outlaws in the old, wild west
Carried a derringer under your vest
I know with a sneer you claim to have been Guinivere
But I am not Lancelot, I was never King Arthur
I say once again "I'm not the man that you're after"
That was a different man, he ain't been here
You say "Why, why, why
Why, why, why
Why, why, why
Don't you love me?"
You were there in Florence as I painted the ceiling
On that old river boat, saw the hands I was dealing
Were you there the night I discovered LSD?
You held my hand through the straights of Magellan
At the medicine shore, snake-oil you were selling
Wasn't that you? Wasn't that me?
You say "Why, why, why
Why, why, why
Why, why, why
Don't you love me?"
On the brink of the moon, at the foot of the Andes
The mouth of the river, as we washed in the Ganges
Pulled the arrow out my eye at Hastings
You washed my brow as I lay in a fever
You were the fulcrum, I was the lever
I'm not a believer, it's just all your time you are wasting
You're a prisoner in a tower, a damsel in distress
Love hold us in thrall, my eternal mistress
You've been wife, my lover, my sister, my mother, my maid
My partner, my consort, my bit on the side
My darling, my sweetheart, my hope and my pride
And all because of some stupid lyrics on "The Blurred Crusade"
You say "Why, why, why
Why, why, why
Why, why, why
Don't you love me?"<start>Now I never meant
To do you wrong
That's what I came here to say
But if I was wrong
Then I'm sorry
I don't let it stand in our way
As my head just aches
When I think of
The things that I shouldn't have done
But, life is for living
We all know
And I don't want to live it alone
Sing
Ah, ah, oh
Sing
Ah, ah, oh,
And just think
Ah, ah, oh
'Cause in the end
There's only us
And oh my friend
There's only love
And in the cave
They're timing us
'Cause in the end
There's only love<start>Well Be Bop A Lula she's my baby
Be Bop A Lula I don't mean maybe
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby
Be Bop A Lula I don't mean maybe
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll.
Well, she's the gal in the red blue jeans
She's the queen of all the teens
She's the woman that I know
She's the woman that (scream) loves me so.
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby
Be Bop A Lula I don't mean maybe
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll.

Well, now she's the woman that's got that beat
She's the woman with the flyin' feet
She's the woman that walks around the store
She's the woman that yells (scream) more, more, more, more.
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby
Be Bop A Lula I don mean maybe
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll.

Well Be Bop A Lula she's my baby

Para sentirte acompaÃ±ado cuando sientes vencido
Una canciÃ³n triste para cuando estas solo
Cuando no sabes el modo de salir adelante
Has tenido el mundo a tus pies
El aroma de la gloria es buena compaÃ±Ã­a
Pero poco duradera, lo que sube baja
Y si permanece intacta
Pierdes las llaves de la mansiÃ³n, alguien ocupo tu salÃ³n
Y se acuesta con tu mujer
Lo peor es que disfruta mÃ¡s que en tu luna de miel
Se baÃ±an en tu piscina se comen tu comida
Y tiran el piano blanco por el balcÃ³n

Para sentirte acompaÃ±ado cuando te sientes vencido
Una canciÃ³n triste para cuando estÃ¡s solo
Cuando no sabes el modo de salir adelante

Para sentirte acompaÃ±ado cuando te sientes vencido
Una canciÃ³n triste para cuando estÃ¡s solo
Cuando no sabes el modo de salir adelante

Los chicos se arrodillaban al verte pasar, como un profeta
O un mesÃ­as, tÃº pronosticabas lo que iba a suceder
Un fallo lo tiene cualquiera, cualquiera menos tÃº
TenÃ­as el touch, y el don especial, tocado por la mano de Dios
Â¿quÃ© es lo que pasÃ³?, Â¿quiÃ©n se ofendiÃ³?

A new reflection creeping in
Got your head so full of traffic
The love pollution's setting in
Cause I'm feeling that I can't go on
I can't go on this way
Turning back a hundred pages in the book
As letters fade
Been calling out for days
As emptiness invades
Another moment's lost again
Just sunk beneath the waves
Been calling out for days
As emptiness invades
But hey, hey, hey...
Holding back the undercover
No respect in giving in
You'd sell your soul to be another
When love pollution's setting in
Cause I'm feeling that I can't go on
I can't go on this way
Turning back a hundred pages in the book
As letters fade
Been calling out for days
As emptiness invades
Another moment's lost again
Just sunk beneath the waves
Been calling out for days
As emptiness invades
But hey, hey, hey ...
'Hey'
You pick the pieces up again
You're like the song that never ends
And you're the reason I wake up
And you're my vision
You're my touch...
Cause I'm feeling that I can't go on
I can't go on this way
Turn it back a hundred pages in the book

Brewing alternatives
What's in the bottom drawer
Waiting for things to give
Spare us the cutter
Spare us the cutter
Couldn't cut the mustard
Conquering myself
Until I see another hurdle approaching
Say we can, say we will
Not just another drop in the ocean
Come to the free for all
With seven tapered knives
Some of them six feet tall
We will escape our lives
Spare us the cutter
Spare us the cutter
Couldn't cut the mustard

Say we can, say we will
Not just another drop in the ocean

Will I still be soiled
When the dirt is off
Conquering myself
Until I see another hurdle approaching
Say we can, say we will
Not just another drop in the ocean

Excuse me the diff but I just can't wait
Deep in a dungeon that's rattling the chains
Man got to fight, he's gonna eat my brain
It feels so good to be afraid
Vincent Price is back again
The heart pumping now, the music sound of time
The vampire's dying, he's got him wild
Red blood dripping, she doesn't have a prayer
I know it's not real but I just don't care
It feels so good to be afraid
Vincent Price is back again<start>It's getting late your eyes are closed and mine are wide awake
(But still!)
I can never go on I can never go on like
(Just like!)
I'm begging just to see your eyes again
I can never go on (I can never go on)
Should I even care that she didn't say anything
Tried to do my best by giving her things
Like rings...
And roses...
Remember to reply when I hint the message
I try to smell my best with a bottle of acids
Get to the point, style and romance
And I could never go on I could never go on

The way she moves away oh
I wanted her to stay awhile don't go home away oh
The way she moves away oh
I wanted her to stay awhile don't go home
Away oh whoa
Shes showing signs of motion as she wipes the sleep away
I can get through this I can get through this ride
You gotta give a little but it takes a lot to get over you
Cause it makes no sense to be permanent if I can't feel, right right right

It's a terrible thing to know what you want
And know you can't have it at all

I was trying really hard to forget about you
I had the radio on and the windows down
I was doing 75 I was covering ground
You see, I had a plan, but I lost my nerve
But then I lost control on a nasty curve
For a second it felt just like I could fly
But then a second is all that it takes
All that it takes to die bye bye.
Well, they scraped me off of that telephone pole
Threw, my carcass in a hearse,
and we started to roll
I couldn't feel no pain although
I was torn right in two
The only thing I could do was think about you
So tell me darling, what else is new?
Now I can see me lying in my plush new bed
I don't remember dying but I sure do look dead
They gotta close the lid because I'm mangled
up so bad
I wish everyone around here wasn't so sad
And I can see you standing with my dad and mom
You're back together but I'm all gone
Before they give me to them graveyard guys
I want one last look into your eyes,
into those eyes

I was trying really hard to forget about you
I was driving my car down 202

I should have never gone<start>Watch me, as I'm coming in the room I feel your stare
Watch me, in a crowd of people I can feel you there

Watch me
Touch me
I know you want me

Don't expect too much from me

Don't expect too much from me
'cause I'm not your little girl
I'm not yours
I'm not your

Touch me, yeah I know you want to, but you know you can't
Touch me, I get more satisfaction with my own hands
Touch me, yeah I know you like it when I scream your name
Touch me, yeah you know I'd let you but you'd go insane
Watch me
Touch me
I know you want me

I have run through the fields
Only to be with you

Only to be with you

What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colors will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still running
You broke the bonds
And you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame, you know I believe it
But I still haven't found

Has passed over me and given to the other
Has passed over me and given to the other

To find out what's gnawing at me
And wouldn't think to look at me
That I've spent a lot of time in education
All seems so long ago
I'm a thinker, not a talker
I've no-one to talk to, anyway
I can't see the road
For the rain in my eyes
I live above the grocers store
Owned by an Austrian
He often calls me down to eat
And he jokes about his broken English
Tries to be a friend to me
But for all my years of reading conversation
I stand without a word to say
I can't see the bridge
For the rain in my eyes
And the world is full of life
Full of folk who don't know me
And they walk in twos or threes or more
While the light that shines above the grocer's store
Investigates my face so rudely
And my essays lying scattered on the floor
Fulfill their needs just by being there
And my hands shake, my head hurts
My voice sticks inside my throat
I'm invisible and dumb and no one will recall me
And I can't see the water through the tears in my eyes<start>She sits beside her
Stares out across the waves as she's digging in the sand
And looks around her
And knows the crazy world would never understand
And she says,
"Please would you find me
I've lost my way
Please would you save me now"
He wakes to find that he's out of love again
And it's time for him to run
And back inside her
He feels his innocence slowly setting with the sun
And he says,
"Please would you save me
I'll lose my way
Please would you help me to escape"<start>You're a mean one, Mr Grinch

Overflowing with the most disgraceful
Assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled-up in tangled-up knots!

Leave the death ledger under City Hall.
Leave the joyful air in that rubber ball today.
Leave the lilac print on the linen sheet.
Leave the birds you killed at your father's feet.
Let the sideways rain and the crooked street remain.
Leave the whimpering dog in his cold kennel.
Leave the dead star lit on her pedestal.
Leave the acid kids in their green fishbowls today.
Just leave the sad guitar in its hard-shelled case.
Leave the worried look on your lover's face.
Let the orange embers in the fireplace remain.
Cause everything - it must belong somewhere.
A train off in the distance; bicycle chained to the stairs.
Everything - it must belong somewhere.
I know that now - that's why I'm staying here.
Leave the ocean's roar in the turquoise shell.
Leave the widower in his private hell.
Leave the liberty in that broken bell today.
Leave the epic poem on its yellow page.
Leave the gray macaw in his covered cage.
Let the traveling band on the interstate remain.
Cause everything - it must belong somewhere.
Soundstage in California; televisions in Times Square.
Everything - it must belong somewhere.
I know that now - that's why I'm staying here.
Leave the secret talks on the trundle bed.
Leave the garden tools in the rusted shed.
Leave those bad ideas in your troubled head today.
Leave the restless ghost in his old hotel.
Leave the homeless man in his cardboard cell.
Let the painted horse on the carousel remain.
Cause everything - it must belong somewhere.
Just like the gold around her finger or the silver in his hair.
Everything - it must belong somewhere.
I know that now - that's why I'm staying here.
In truth, the forest hears each sound - each blade of grass as it lies down.
The world requires no audience - no witnesses...no witnesses.
Leave the old town drunk on his wooden stool.
Leave the autumn leaves in the swimming pool.
Leave the poor black child in his crumbling school today.
Leave the novelist in his daydream tune.
Leave the scientist in his Rubik's Cube.
Let the true genius in the padded room remain.
Leave the horse's hair on the slanted bow.
Leave the slot machines on the river boat.
Leave the cauliflower in the casserole today.
Leave the hot, bright trash in the shopping malls.
Leave the hawks of war in their capitol.
Let the organ's moan in the cathedral remain.
Cause everything - it must belong somewhere.
They locked the devil in the basement; threw God up into the air.
Everything - it must belong somewhere.
And you know it's true - I wish you'd leave me here.
You know it's true - why don't you leave me here?<start>was ich viel viel beeindruckender finde als tokio-gay-tel an sich ist das was hier so abluft...
hier posten massenweise mdels von denen einige wohl tatschlich glauben das ihre posts an tokiohotel gehen und es sich um ein fan-forum handelt.
in momenten in denen ich solchen anballungen exzessiver bldheit ausgesetzt bin kann ich nur noch an massenmord oder selbstmord denken, was kann da in einem einzelnen gehirn so alles aufeinmal schiefgehen das sowas dabei rauskommt?
macht mich wirklich manchmal traurig dass die massenverdummung das internet mittlerweile erreicht hat, war ja auch nur eine frage der zeit...

I'm breathing stillborn hearts full of lies
you say everything is for a reason
I say you're right
and as we come together
our lives and souls as one
we hope this will last forever
I know I won't let go
I'll never be the same
there's no one left to blame
I can see myself through the window of your pain
what have I become
this life has made me numb
come and break my heart
so I can live again
our lips touch for the very first time
I drink you in like heavenly wine
you say everything has its season
I say you're right
and as we come together
our lives and souls as one
we hope this will last forever
I know I won't let go
I'll never be the same
there's no one left to blame
I can see myself through the window of your pain
what have I become
this life has made me numb
come and break my heart
so I can live again
what have I become
this life has made me numb
come and break my heart
so I can live again
I'll never be the same
there's no one left to blame
I can see myself through the window of your pain
what have I become
this life has made me numb
come and break my heart
so I can live again<start>You pushed it to the limit
now you gotta choose tonight
Tarot woman, you're all about to loose the fight
Don't need a part time wizard
Who drives me outta my mind
'cause I'm allright
I gonna live it up tonight
Once upon a time,
trought the world was mine alone
had no time to realize,
it came without a warning at all
Like a fist in your face
A fist in your face
And there's a time bomb ticking
Deep inside my head
Must be a black hole attraction
A wrong step n' your dead
Don't know the words surrender
Don't know the rules of the game
I'm ready to go and I swear
You won't forget my name<start>It was April the tenth
I remember it well
It was so cold that year
It was colder than hell
Things haven't been good
For you, for a while
Because I'd been on tour
I hadn't heard
And you've dropped in
With the letter you wrote
And I read it aloud
To prove that I could
And we were both laughing
Cause we know how you are
We never thought
Your quitting was good
We thought that we knew you
And I guess that we don't
Are you heavenly or
just like the past?
We called you "the black penny"
Remember that?
The sea is wide
The streets are long
And there's blood on all our hands
With the catalyst gone
And only what's left to us
Is history built on dust
I was sweating on poet's words
Great nations and governments
Sweet lies and victories
Eager and keen to please
those good keys are everywhere
with their thousand-yard stare
We all end up the same
Like little lambs to meet their end<start>Well, since my baby left me
I found a new place to dwell
It's down at the end of lonely street
At heartbreak hotel
And I get so lonely baby
I get so lonely baby
I get so lonely baby, I could die
Oh, though it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
To cry there in their gloom
I get so lonely baby
I get so lonely baby
I get so lonely baby, I could die
Well, the bell hop's tears keep flowing
And the desk clerk's dressed in black
They been so long on lonely street
They'll never look back
I've been so lonely baby
I've been so lonely baby
I've been so lonely baby, I could die
So if your baby leaves you
You got a tale to tell
Just take a walk down lonely street
To heartbreak hotel
I get so lonely baby
I get so lonely baby
I get so lonely baby, I could die
I could die<start>My lonely heart was made for two
It beats too slowly without you
You wanna know what we can be
But you won't give your love to me
Oh I'm calling your name but you won't listen
Oh if love is made for two,
Then there's one heart missing
One heart missing
Tonight the sky is burning blue
Horizon cuts right into you
You be the moon, I'll be the sea
And you can shine your light on me
Oh I'm crying your name but you won't listen
Oh tonight was made for two,
But there's one heart missing
One heart missing
Oh and I'ma follow you no matter when you run
I'm holding all the cards, there's only one
One heart missing
One heart missing
One heart missing
One heart missing<start>Dim the lanterns, kill the lights, let's leave tonight to hide away
To take cold comfort in the dark and leave our hearts behind to wait
We'll tear away these dreadful skins that we must shed to start again
The evil things that you can do are easy if you think them through
Are easy if you can pretend
So shut your windows lock your doors
Here come the snakes you best be sure
To keep your conscience bolted tight
'Cause they'll be lying waiting
Coiled up in the corner a devil never dies
Vending venom sickly sweet to help you through the night
You say you're an angel but I say you're a liar
'Cause you were burning long before you crept into this fire
So keep your shadow out of sight the time is right to hide away
To keep your conscience frozen numb the time has come don't be afraid
We'll tear away these dreadful skins that we must shed to start again
The sickest thing they did to you the did because you let them through
The did because you let them in
So shut your windows lock your doors
Here come the snakes you best be sure
To keep your conscience bolted tight
'Cause they'll be lying waiting
Coiled up in the corner a devil never dies
Vending venom sickly sweet to help you through the night
You say you're an angel but I say you're a liar
'Cause you were burning long before you crept into this fire
I know you've been burning we both know there's no light
So dim the lanterns so we don't see the darkness of this night<start>You came and made me
FRAGILE
Sweet Refractor I'm indebted to you
For your need in choosing me to be the one to subdue
I've so much to think of when a push comes to shove
Because I know that it's easier to hate
Hate than love<start>Waking up in pieces
On Monday noon
I'm a burdon to myself
Gonna to crack real soon
My armour, my shield
The food for my greed
I thought I knew when it was time to quit
But only in my mind
Guess you don't know your own kind
Guess I failed to walk along
My tactics were just wrong
Only in my mind
I'll make it the next time
Don't tell me the stories
Bring out the wine
Turn on your ecstasy, ecstasy
Bring out the wine
Bring out my enemy, my enemy
Thought I made mistakes
That I had a full view
If you had your doubts
I'd beat the hell out of you
Your cheering smiles
Were hatred in disguise
You didn't dare to pay the price
But it was only in my mind
Guess you don't know your own kind
Guess I failed to walk along
My tactics were just wrong
Only in my mind
I'll make it the next time
Don't tell me the stories
Bring out the wine
Turn on your ecstasy, ecstasy
Bring out the wine
Bring out my enemy, my enemy<start>Lover, lover, goodbye
So slowly goes the night
I trace the print of your body with my hand
Like the map of some forbidden land
I trace the ghosts of your bones
With my trembling hand
Dark is my night
But darker is my day yeah
I must've been blind
Out of my mind
Not to read the warning signs
How goes it?
It goes lonely
Goes slowly
So slowly goes the night
Ten lonely days, ten lonely nights
I watch the moon get flayed anew
Until the moom becomes the skinning tool
I send the skins of my sins out to cover and comfort you
I know of a Heaven
And honey I know of a Hell yeah
I hang my head
In my bed
And remember what you said
"One evening, I'm leaving"
And I laughed and checked her breathing
And said darling
Go slowly through the knight
O baby, I feel the heal of time
I wake to find you sitting here
Cutting tangels out of your hair
Singing a song that's all wrong
Hey, but that's alright, I don't care
O darling forgive me
For all the misery yeah
I embrace an empty space
And your laughing song it fades
Where goes it?
It goes some place
Where it's lonely
And black as the night
Come back, darling and put things right
I hang my head and cry cry cry
Darling, all night I try
To cease on a reason for this mad mad season
The nights, they are so long now
I can't remember it being light
Call it sleep, call it death, call it what you like
But only sleep, dear
Only sleep brings you back to life yeah
I hang my head
I toss and I sweat
I never never can forget
How goes it?
I'm going, but slowly slowly going
And we both know that it's gonna be alright<start>Call up my rockboy finally score
He's got drama like a toreador and
Me and the bottle we're on the mend
I'm tired of winning gonna lose again
I said I'm gonna miss being the boy
I'm gonna miss being the man yeah
I'm gonna miss being the boy
I'm gonna miss being the man yeah
When I go down to f l a
Sand in my shoes think of you
I can't get it out it's kinda rough
I like the way it feels but it's not enough
I said I'm gonna miss being the boy
I'm gonna miss being the man yeah
I'm gonna miss being the boy
I'm gonna miss being the man yeah
I said hey baby don't you need me now
Mtns of glory
Mtns of glory
I said now hey baby don't you want to feel these
Mtns of glory
Mtns of glory
I said hey honey don't you miss me now
Mtns of glory
Mtns of glory
I said hey honey don't you want to feel these
Mtns of glory
Mtns of glory
I'm gonna miss being the boy
I'm gonna miss being the man yeah
I'm gonna miss being the boy
I'm gonna miss being the man yeah
I said I'm gonna miss being the boy
I'm gonna miss being the man
I'm said hey baby don't you miss me now
Mtns of glory
Mtns of glory
Yeah<start>I didn't think this could happen to me
I wanted the easy road
I had my parade, but it started to rain
And now it looks out of control
Why do I feel like Your hiding?
Oh remind me again
I am loved
I am Yours
I have someone beside me, I can't deny
I am loved
Sometimes we go to sleep wishing that we could be different then who we are
Chasing our dreams has taken its toll on me
I tried just a little too hard
And I, I keep beating myself up
Oh remind me again
I am loved
I am Yours
I have someone to find me
Someone to guide me home
I am loved
I'm not alone
I have someone beside me
And I can't deny I am loved
You're not far away (x3) (echo)
Maybe you're driving out there on the highway
Feels like you're out on your own
Let me remind you God never left you
He's right there wherever you go
You are loved
You're not alone
You have someone to find you
Someone to guide you home
You are loved
You're not alone
Cause God is beside you
And He won't deny you are loved
Cause God is beside you
And He won't deny you are loved<start>I could only sleep when you were next to me
then I'd never wanna get up
good morning, sunshine
did you dream about me?
and what the hell's in the way of our today?
yesterday I had it figured out
you were gonna be mine
now you love me more than toast and less than a staple gun
(chorus)
let's not blow it right now
let's not do something we'd both regret
never is a long time to wait for you
and I'm not getting any younger
not getting any younger
who's the new kid that you're seeing?
does he ever buy you flowers?
does he ever tell you that he'd love you till the end of time?
does he ever never wanna hurt you?
(chorus)
i just want someone to be there on my birthday
i just want someone to get real drunk with
i just want someone who needs someone to need them
because I've got nothing left that I believe in
so hello, and it's goodbye again
I'm going home to cry again
you still have all those letters I wrote you
and I still have my song<start>In another life
I woke up dreaming with a sigh
As the morning light
Was painting whispers of a joy
And I was in the candlelit bedroom
Enchanting beauty shimmering magically
Like an irridescent cloud
Being blown by a westerly wind
She can move your soul without you knowing
She can take your breath away from heaven
And I was captured by her loneliness
A wounded tiger on a willowy path
Like an opalescent moon all alone
In the sky of a foreign land<start>Los Angeles, city of eternal night
The dream of a girl thirteen
Swirling cherry vanilla
What this jungle be
Down is the skirt of a juvenile dream queen
Hot like an asphalt 7-11
Or maybe a suffragette
The hips sink ?
The orb ?
The face dripping Clearasil and cum
But by the neon light of the Oki-Dog
I knew I'd seen that face before
She raced
Quite like a speed demon yeah
Off into the night
She went
Quite like a speed demon
But she ain't never coming back
She was a speed demon yeah
Talk about speed, baby<start>She has eyes disability blue
A German dog and strict curfew
And if one man's cage is another man's stage
Then she's turned the script to another page
And she doesn't really give a damn
What you have to say
She makes a call on her friend's cell phone
The operator answers and says "You're not alone"
And if one man's ceiling is another's dance floor
Then she'll be the one running to the sea shore
Trying to tell the seagulls
This is home
And if one man's cage is another man's stage
Then she'll be the one wiser than her age
Trying to get the message to your ear<start>The world is full of married men
With wives who never understand.
They're looking for someone to share
The excitement of a love affair.
And just as soon as they find you
They'll wine you and dine you.
Fly on the wings of romance.
But in the eyes of the world
You're just another girl
Who loves a married man.
Uh! They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it
Again and again.
Ow! They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.
These married men.
Ooh, you make him feel so young,
But his wife is still the number one.
He promises to marry you.
Yeah, just as soon as his divorce comes through.
Whoa, it's not just a fling,
He swears it's the real thing,
A love that will last 'til the end.
But as he's driving away
You know it's true what they say
About a, a married man.
They say they do it, they do it, they do it, they do it
Again and again.
Wooo, they do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.
These married men.
Ah, he'll run when the scandal
Gets too hot to handle.
He'll say he just wants to be friends.
And then he'll walk outta your life
And go home to his wife
'cause he's a married man.
Oh, your love is a secret.
You've got to sneak it
Long as you can.
Don't cry for your lover.
There's always another
Married man! Married men!
They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.
Married, married men.
Ahh! They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.
These married men.
The world is full of them.
Girls, now listen.
They're hungry. Don't trust a . . .
Oh, the world is full of them.
The world is full of them!
They do it, they do it, they do it, do it
Again and again.
They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.
Oh girl, these married men.
They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it
Again and again.
They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.
Can't help but lovin'.
Oh, honey, they do it and then they do it again.
Ooh, make you feel real good!
Ow! They do it and then they do it again.
They love you and leave you
(Nasty, nasty married men)
I know! The world is full of them.
The world is full of them!
They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.
Whoa, I love a . . .
Ah! They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.
Don't trust a . . .
Ooh, you make him feel so young,
But his wife is still number one.
He promises to marry you.
Yeah, just as soon as his divorce comes through.
I know! The world is full of them!
The world is full of them!
They do it, they do it, they do t, they do it.
Whoa, I love a . . .
Ah! They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it!
Don't trust a . . .
Ow! They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it!
Bum's gonna hurt you, destroy you!
Yeah! They do it, they do it.
They're gonna do it, do it to you.
Married men, married men.
They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.
Please! They do it and then they do it again!
Again and again and again!
They do it, I don't care what you do!
Take off that mask, old boy!
You did not listen to me, baby! . . .<start>I can tell that you're surprised to see me
Standin' at your door at three a.m.
Yes I had someone else to talk to
Sometimes a man needs more than just a friend
Yes I know what they will say about us
The bitter tongue of gossip's never fair
I'm with you to me that's all that matters
That's one of the reasons why I'm here
They all think that I just barely know you
They'll all say I'm forward fresh and crude
But they don't know that you've been thinking bout me
The same way I've been thinking about you
There's nothing wrong with reaching up for someone
When you believe that someone really cares
Time is precious and it waits for no one
That's one of the reasons why I'm here
As we lie here with only love between us
I can feel your heartbeat runnin' wild
You gently touch the ring that's on my finger
It's all that's left between me and my wife
She left me for someone else this evening
She found someone else's love to share
She freed me from the chains that kept me from you
Julia now you know why I'm here<start>Words & Music by
Ed Bruce and Baxter Black
- Chorus -
Ship my body back to Texas if I die out on the trail
I won't worry where they bury me, just put me in the mail
Lay me down in cowtown where I'll never be alone
Or pushin' up the rose of San Antone
Lookin' for some greener grass, I left my lone star home
Put my trust in wanderlust, struck out for parts unknown
I tried California where it's sunny all the time
But someone dug up all the gold in '49
(Repeat Chorus)
I headed for Alaska, where I thought I'd change my luck
But the nights are long and cold and lunch can cost a hundred bucks
They're shuttin' down the motor town, the lights at night aren't pretty
And you can't walk the streets of New York City
(Repeat Chorus)
I spent my last ten dollars drinkin' rum down in the Keyes
Shipped aboard a freighter and I've seen more than seven seas
'Cause one square mile of ocean looks just like the one next to it
If I could find my way back home, I'd do it
(Repeat Chorus)
Now, plant me in the parking lot outside the Astrodome
Or pushin' up the rose of San Antone<start>whenever I'm around you're never really happy
everything I ask you ends up really snappy
you're always walking round, stumble on the floor
cause you don't wanna be with me no more
it's like an earthquake, earthquake
whenever we're together
it's like an earthquake, earthquake
whenever we're together
earthquake, earthquake
whenever we're together<start>I woke up this morning
And looked out my window
I could see the sun shining down on me
It reminded me of You
And of all that You do
And of all the love that You've shown to me
Your mercy oh Lord is new every morning
Your wisdom is waiting for me to ask
Though I might stumble
Though I lose my step now
Your grace is gonna cover what I lack
Thank You Lord
Oh thank You Lord
I am so thankful for a friend like You
Jesus Your love is better than life to me
Your goodness is always by my side
And why you love me is hard for me to see
But I love you Lord cause You've been so good to me<start>As I drift away
Far away from you,
I feel all alone in a crowded room,
Thinking to myself
"There's no escape from this
Fear
Regret
Loneliness."
Visions of love and hate
A collage behind my eyes
Remnants of dying laughter
Echoes of silent cries
I wish I didn't know now that
I never knew then
Flashback
Memories punish me again.
Sometimes I remember all the pain that I have seen
Sometimes I wonder what might have been
Visions of love and hate
A collage behind my eyes
Remnants of dying laughter
Echoes of silent cries
And sometimes I despair
At who I've become
I have to come to terms
With what I've done
The bittersweet taste of fate
We can't outrun the past
Destined to find an answer
A strength I never lost
I know there is a way,
My future is not set,
For the tide has turned
But still I never learned to live without regret<start>I'm looking at a face, a pointed chin
Towards the sky in arrogance
It easily betrays the closest friend
A moment lost, no consequence
A circle starts again, away from you
Deception pulls us in, away from you
Away from you, away from you
Imitation, a fabrication
A pretty fake, but counterfeit
An empty carcass behind the artist
Is there a trait of innocence?
So how do you portray a sentiment?
Where users brought
The truth is bent
And much to our dismay, they're ignorant
The more that we make up the more it fits
A circle starts again, away from you
Deception pulls us in, away from you
Away from you, away from you
Imitation, a fabrication
A pretty fake, but counterfeit
An empty carcass behind the artist
Is there a trait of innocence?
This doesn't feel right
Feels like everything's further away
Dead as the nightlife
Hindsight, watching another mistake
We never feel right, warm night
Following into the day
Dead as the street light, pure white
Washing the color away
Imitation, a fabrication
A pretty fake, but counterfeit
An empty carcass behind the artist
Is there a trait of innocence?<start>(VERSE 1)
You walk among the blind
With your future undefined
You stare as history repeats
But go into your mind
And try to find
What leads you to your destiny
(PRE-CHORUS)
Here we stand, for all time
Together well defy the darkest nights
So take my hand, hold on tight
Well never die
You know we will survive
(CHORUS)
We
Will
Survive
(VERSE 2)
The battle has begun
Will you stand and overcome
Or be shot down by self-defeat?
Riding on the line
Youll choose a side
And we will see a victory<start>Goodnight kiss in your nightgown
Lavender in your bed
So innocent as you lie down
Sweet dreams that run through your head
Are you lonely without Mommy's love?
I want you to know I'd die for that moment
You're just a poor girl
Afraid of this cruel world
Taken away from it all
It's been 5 years to the day and
My tainted blood's still the same
I can't help acting this way and
Those bastard doctors are gonna pay
I'm so lonely without baby's love
I want you to know I'd die for one more moment
I'm just a poor girl
Afraid of this cruel world
Taken away from it all<start>London calling to the faraway towns
Now that war is declared and battle come down
London calling to the underworld
Come out of the cupboard, all you boys and girls
London calling, now don't look at us
All that phoney Beatlemania has bitten the dust
London calling, see we ain't got no swing
'Cept for the ring of that truncheon thing
The ice age is coming, the sun is zooming in
Meltdown expected, the wheat is growing thin
Engines stopped running, but I have no fear
London is drowning and I live by the river
London calling to the imitation zone
Forget it, brother, an' go it alone
London calling upon the zombies of death
Quit holding out and draw another breath
London calling and I don't wanna shout
But when we were talking, I saw you nodding out
London calling, see we ain't got no highs
Except for that one with the yellowy eyes
The ice age is coming, the sun is zooming in
Engines stop running and the wheat is growing thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
London is drowning and I live by the river
I live by the river<start>I lost my taste for sin
It lives in my frustration
I lost my way to win
'Cause you're feeling my temptation
Woa woa woa, I know I miss it
Woa woa woa, yea
Woa woa woa, I know I miss it
Woa woa woa
[Chorus]
All after seeing you crush your lips
Secrets that changed my meditation
You have to feel our defense
From all the lies and the declarations
All I know
This finger's for you
Yea
This finger's for you
Found myself some change
I'm losing my religion
I drink it all within
I live with my decision
Woa woa woa, I know I miss it
Woa woa woa, yea
Woa woa woa, I know I miss it
Woa woa woa
[Chorus]
Please hold me
Please hold me now
Please hold me
Come, angel
This, this, this
This finger's for you
This, this, this
This finger's for you
[Chorus]<start>Well I'm back from the road,
And you're out on it,
And I'm tired of this distance,
And I believe it's over,
It's over
I'm waiting..
And this phone tag game is endless,
The novelty is wearing,
I'm hoping time will pass,
Without any assistance or convincing
Road rules apply,
There's so much action
You're getting busy,
So I'll call you're cellular phone,
To tell you tv night was,
Lonely without you,
And so am I,
So am I
It seems our day keeps falling on a Leap Year
So many high points on this last leg,
I can't wait to recount them,
It seems like nothing's happened until I've shared them with you,
And the note that you have called,
Says that you're half a day away,
And you're heading home,
Just in time for me,
For me,
To leave
And road rules apply
There's so much action
I'm getting busy,
So make sure that I'm up to date on tv night,
I hate to miss out,
I think I miss you most,
On Wednesdays and Saturdays,
Seems our day keeps falling on a leap year<start>You're walking along quietly
There's the sound of running feet
You turn around the corner
There's fighting on the street
See all the kids they wanna good time
They all wanna get stuck in
Don't know, don't care
if they're fighting for a cause
AS long as they get one in
Go
We're fighting in the streets
You all look for solutions
But you can rack your brains
No matter what the gov't do
Its never ever gonna change
Wankers hand hand out leaflets
They'll never ever let it be
I don't care what they do
But they better not come near me
Go
We're fighting in the streets
You're walking along quietly
There's the sound of running feet
You turn around the corner
There's fighting on the street
See all the kids they wanna good time
They all wanna get stuck in
Don't know, dont care
if they're fighting for a cause
AS long as they get one in
We're always fighting in the streets
We're always fighting in the streets
We're always fighting in the streets
We're always fighting in the streets<start>Completely colorblind, these red lights are going unseen
Fall behind with words unsaid you know they're always obscene
'cause my ears, they bled before; I need to let them heal
She fell out; her broken legs won't let her walk away
From this town that couldn't give a single shit either way
And her fears, they bled before she's convinced that they're real
What are you looking for?
Are you looking for something more?
It's not me
It's not me
Lost her way from everything she swore she knew, a friend
Run away from start to finish though it never ends
In her mind she is blinded by all she sees
Close your eyes; just pretend the bullet isn't there
No surprise; no need to pretend that no one really cares
But in her eyes you will find the very best in me
What are you looking for?
Are you looking for something more?
It's not me
It's not me<start>Do you wake up in the middle of the night
Find your eyes are on full beam
Totally wired
Sweat stains and troubled dreams
Your throat is burnin' dry
Caught in your worst nightmare
You cannot deny
And now you've become
What you said you'd never become
Hate yourself for all the things you've never done
You tell yourself you're too old
I know you're still young
You're wanting to scream
You still hold your tongue
Whoohoo, whoohoo
You're at the breaking point
Whoohoo, whoohoo
Just one step away
Whoohoo, whoohoo
You're at the breaking point
Whoohoo, whoohoo
And in the morning
Do you remember the night?
Put on dark sunglasses to shut out the light
Shut out the pain
Shut out the red in your eyes you hide
Everytime you look in the mirror
How do you live with your life?
Whoohoo, whoohoo
You're at the breaking point
Whoohoo, whoohoo
Just one step away
Whoohoo, whoohoo
You're at the breaking point
Whoohoo, whoohoo
Whoohoo, whoohoo
You're at the breaking point
Whoohoo, whoohoo
One step, one step away
Whoohoo, whoohoo
You're at the breaking point
Whoohoo, whoohoo<start>Don't see eye to eye so why even try?
Something clouds your vision in the corner of your eye.
So I misunderstand. Over again I see that you wanna be
the one who pulls on my puppet strings but strings
don't make me dance no more.
Strings fall to the floor.
Candlesticks and bonded wrists
don't make me dance no more.
Something that you're selling is something I won't buy.
Miscommunication is the key to our demise.
Why do you want to sing my praises?
Do you want to save my soul?
Is your inner child tainted?
Do you want to be in control?
Stella, a stella, a stella to me.
Stella, Stella, Stella, do me.<start>I'm envious of your i.q. of 37
You, you're the one
It's written all over your face
You, you're the one
I'd like to take your place.
I'm envious of your i.q. of 37
Your lack of brains just drives me crazy
Its the only way to get by and be lazy
You, you're the one
It's written all over your face
You, you're so dumb
I'd like to take your place.
I'm envious of your i.q. of 37
From where I come it's the dumber the better
No-one likes a really go getter<start>Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it is true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
I want you in the morning, girl, I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue
I'm living every moment, girl, for you
Walk, walk cat, walk, go, Johnny, go
Same old tale of blues
Elmo James got nothing on this, baby
I've loved you from the moment, I saw you
You looked at me that's all you had to do
I feel it now, I hope you feel it too<start>My little sister's in the front seat with an ice cream cone
My ma's in the back seat sitting all alone
As my pa steers her slow out of the lot
For a test drive down Michigan Avenue
Now my ma she fingers her wedding band
And watches the salesman stare at my old man's hands
He's telling us all about the break he'd give us, if he could but he just can't
Well if I could I swear I know just what I'd do
Now mister the day the lottery I win
I ain't ever gonna ride in no used car again
Now the neighbors come from near and far
As we pull up in our brand new used car
I wish he'd just hit the gas and let out a cry
And tell them all they can kiss our asses goodbye
My dad he sweats the same job from morning to morn
Me I walk home on the same dirty streets where I was born
Up the block I can hear my little sister in the front seat blowing that horn
The sounds echoing all down Michigan Avenue
Now mister the day my number comes in
I ain't ever gonna ride in no used car again<start>Standing there in the pouring rain
My sun sets to the north
Can't you see the glow?
Light fades for the fatherless
But I harbour hope
Cant you see me glow?...
...Glow
These waves they crash below
We'll sail to a distant shore
We'll cross into that glow
Father, Father, can you hear me?
There's tearing in my soul
But can't you find the cure?
Sweat-soaked world of fears and seams
Polluted to the core
But I still harbour hope...
...Hope
These waves they crash below
We'll sail to a distant shore
We'll cross into that glow
The shore
Waves, they crash below
Sail to a distant shore
Crash into that glow<start>Intro:

Eternal and so cold
And you know this heart is cold
Eternal, always cold

Many things still whisper to me
You're never gone

And I'm still feelin' guilty cause you're wanting me to stay
Well I know, how I know, it's harder on you
But you said it yourself, there's nothing else we could do.
When the wheels start turnin', takin' me through the night
Out there in the darkness, there's a star shinin' bright
And it makes me feel better just to see it up there
I hope you're thinkin' about it, hope you know I still care.
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home.
Now I know you've been waiting, but I'll be seeing you soon
Meanwhile I just lay here staring at the moon
And a light made of silver, through my window it creeps
And the train keeps on rollin', and it just rocks me to sleep.
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home

Hanging in your sleep
Hanging in a dream

With a hard-faced
Three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you to a zone
And you were clearly
Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me
Typical me
I started something
And now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
Uh, that's what tradition means
And I doused another venture
With a gesture
That was absolutely vile
Continued below
I started something
I forced you to a zone
And you were clearly
Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me
Typical me
I started something
And now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
Uh, that's what tradition means
And now eighteen months' hard labour
Seems fair enough
I started something
And I forced you to a zone

Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted

Foreign lands, alien birds and new stories that no one heard
To stick a pin in the globe and to believe and hope
There's a whole new world to unravel as far as a boyscout can travel
Company of adventurers on the secret track
Caesars of the wilderness around the world and back
Card carrying members
Oh, we're the Lords of the Atlas
To see God standing on a local hill
And to know there's forests untrod still
Don't look back when you climb the stairs
I'm traveling on mental fares
Going through the eternal cloud land
To the ends of the world
And after 2000 steps of climbing
I know it was the whole trip worth
Company of adventurers on the secret track
Caesars of the wilderness around the world and back
Card carrying members
Oh, we're the Lords of the Atlas
Company of adventurers on the secret track
Caesars of the wilderness around the world and back
Card carrying members
Oh, we're the Lords of the Atlas
We're the Lords, yeah, we're the Lords of the Atlas
Yeah, we're the Lords of the Atlas
Sitting cross legged on Persian rugs
Addicted to a 1000 drugs
Our flags nailed to a mast

I will lay and talk of my hopes and dreams

Dive into me
dive into me
I'll meet you underwater there, sometime
so say the words before you leave;
tear my heart off my sleeve
and tell me you believe, in me, in me, in me
Dive into me
dive into me
I'll meet you underwater there, sometime
and I'll swim halfway,
if you swim halfway
words help me believe,
but this is killing me
Dive into me
dive into me
I'll meet you underwater there, sometime.<start>Is there someone in the night who can make me feel right I've been feelin' for so long
Is there someone out there with the dream that I can share
Is there someone who will care if I'm gone or if I'm here
Who can help me set my spirit free
I'm lonely and I need somebody to love me
I've got tender lovin' words no woman's ever heard
The women I tried turned out wrong
They were noisy they were fast all the kinds that never last
In this big and lonesome world there's just got to be a girl
Who can help me to solve last mistery
I'm lonely and I need somebody to love me
I never had a woman waitin' lonely at my door
It's got me feelin' bad you see and I just can't take anymore
So I'm askin' anyone who had to bring the morning sun tryin' hard not to cry
But you're feelin' nothin' new I've been cryin' just like you
Maybe me and you should try to help each other fly we can be the lovers hard to be
I'm lonely and I need somebody to love me
I'm lonely and I need somebody to love<start>How much longer will I be waiting for you
You know that I've been thinking of what I'm gonna do
I knew when I saw you, the look on your face
I hardly had to ask you over to my place
I've been waiting, anticipating you
You know it's just a waste of time
Hoping I would change my mind
What's this coming over me
I don't feel free anymore
I could please you, but I don't choose to now
I've got needs you know, please fullfill them somehow
I know I seem demanding, but it's all worthwhile
I need your understanding of how to make me smile
I can see you working out just fine
What do you think you mean to me
How important you must seem
What's this coming over me
I don't feel free anymore.<start>I read the paper and i hear the news.
I search the heavens vainly for clues.
Where has he gone to, and where can he be?
I need someone, we need someone.
Come back, jimmy dean.
Yesterday morning i read in the times,
Things cost a dollar that once cost a dime.
And everyone's lonely 'cause everyone's free.
I need someone. we need someone.
Come back, jimmy dean.
All our loves are loved and lost.
Our hearts all hung with rust.
All the golden birds and lads all must,
Like chimney sweeps, come to dust.
I'll pour a drink; adjust my TV,
And stare at the shadows that stare out at me.
I have no expectations, oh, but occasionally
I need someone. you were someone.
Come back, jimmy dean.
I need someone. you were someone.
Please come back, jimmy dean.<start>So true funny how it seems
Always in time, but never in line for dreams
Head over heels when toe to toe
This is the sound of my soul
This is the sound
I bought a ticket to the world
But now I've come back again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
Oh, I want the truth to be said
I know this much is true
I know this much is true
With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
Dissolve the nerves that have just begun
Listening to Marvin all night long
This is the sound of my soul
This is the sound
Always slipping from my hands
Sand's a time of it's own
Take your seaside arms and write the next line
Oh, I want the truth to be known
I know this much is true
I know this much is true
I bought a ticket to the world
But now I've come back again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
Oh, I want the truth to be said
I know this much is true
I know this much is true
This much is true
This much is true
This much is true
This much is true

I sense you're riding pretty low
I got the feeling
When your hair hits the ceiling
Something, babe, you oughta know
I won't cry if you walk by
But if we both kind of stumble
Maybe I'll say hi that's my best
I never try that much
'Cause I'm scared of feeling
That appealing touch
You gotta get through
My maze and pass every test
'Cause I'm choosin' one love
Tattooed across my chest
Know the time has come
I ain't gonna fester no more
Let the world be free of my disease
I never knew a rubber doll
Would be so hard to please
Now I'm preachin' out
One last burst before I retract
No one will know
'Til I finally let go of the one thing
I ain't never going to give back
I want to help you, baby, can't you see
You're better than my pillow?
'Cause you don't stain so easily
You know it's hard just to finally let go
And leave all the pictures behind
Hope I brought you some happiness
I believe I just had to get on
'Cause just wasn't a world
I wished to need to find<start>Somewhere there's somebody who looks just like you do
Acts just like you do - feels the same way
Somewhere there's a person in a far away place
With a different name and a face that looks like you
Do ya think about who it might be?
Do you wonder where you are?
In a distant foreign country ridin' 'round in another car
Where the wheels keep on turning and turning and turning
And nothing's disturbing the way they go around
All your thoughts are in another head
Your dreams are sleepin' in a different bed
The force that moves you is a circular breath of life and death
Going round and round and round
The wheel keeps on turning and turning and turning
And nothing's disturbing the way it goes around
Maybe you ride a different wave
Maybe you catch another ray of the sun
That I've just begun to feel
Back and forth and back and forth around again<start>Livello 1 - Pupazzo patetico
vestito a festa all'una a pranzo dai suoi
"Signora, sa, una pasta al forno
cos non l'ho mangiata mai"
Livello 2 - L'interrogatorio
"Ma con mia figlia tu che intenzioni hai?
Lei ha bisogno di uno serio
Spero non ci deluderai"
Poi di corsa dagli amici del bar
almeno per mezz'ora un p di tranquillit
ma da come guardano
sembrano che mi dicano
"Bello, non ti passa pi
te la sei voluta tu
vuoi la bici e poi
pedalare cazzi tuoi!"
Livello 3 - Le menate da panico
"Non sei lo stesso che eri un anno fa
eri romantico pi spesso
sento gi che non durer"
Livello 4 - Gli altarini si scoprono
mollato in tronco senza dir neanche "Bah"
telefonate, notti in bianco
perdita della dignit
Poi di corsa dagli amici del bar
far finta di niente che nessuno lo sa
per mi conoscono
e so che capiscono
"Bello, non ti passa pi
te la sei voluta tu
vuoi la bici e poi
pedalare cazzi tuoi"
Livello 5 - Almeno ci siamo noi
non sar tanto per ci baster
aperitivo, cena fuori
"Approvato all'unanimit!"
Livello 6 - A volte ritornano
ti vedo in fondo al ristorante con lui
con degli amici tanto antichi
che sembrate antichi anche voi
Io d'istinto te lo direi
Ma con uno del genere che cazzo ci fai?
Per in fondo giusto cos
perch sono sicuro che con quello li
Bella, non ti passa pi
te lo sei voluto tu...<start>You'll never see a dark cloud hanging round me
Now there is only blue skies to surround me
There's never been a gray day since you found me
Everything I touch is turning to gold
Oh, you can colour my world with sunshine yellow each day
Oh, you can colour my world with happiness all the way
Just take the green from the grass and the blue from the sky up above
And if you colour my world just paint it with your love, just colour my world
Just as long as I know you're thinking of me
There'll be a rainbow always up above me
Since I found the one who really loves me
Everything I touch is turning to gold
So you can colour my world with sunshine yellow each day
Oh, you can colour my world with happiness all the way
Just take the green from the grass and the blue from the sky up above
And if you colour my world just paint it with your love, just colour my world
Sunshine yellow
Orange blossoms
Laughing faces
Everywhere, yeah
So you can colour my world with sunshine yellow each day
Oh, you can colour my world with happiness all the way
Just take the green from the grass and the blue from the sky up above
And if you colour my world just paint it with your love, just colour my world
Colour my world
Oh, colour my world<start>What do you get for your anger
And what do you get for your pain
Its how you live this life in danger
Your always on the go
Still only scars remain
Well its been so long since I have tried
Yea its been so long since I have cried
So life goes on
Yea its been so long
Yea its been so long sice I've felt the pain
Well I'm movin east bound on the west bound train
So life goes on
Its been so long
I try to do what is right now
I don't try to do what is wrong
The lies of guilt are comin out now
And I sit here alone
And sing another song
Just take a look in the miror
And tell me what do you see
Down play the croud to the guily
And make believe, and make believe you don't need me<start>Can you believe it'
It's been almost ten years now
And I'm getting that feeling
as we're driving 'round this town
Passing by the old school yard
everything just looks so small
Before the drums and the guitars
way back when we knew it all
And she's sitting right next to me, her hand in the wind
In that old white Cherokee I grew up in
Yeah, it's crazy
Crazy but it's true
That you never get a second chance at the first time
We will never be eighteen again
No, you never get a second chance at the first time
It's so good to see you my old friend
It's good to see you again
Can you believe it?
How much everything has changed'
Well, they shut down the old diner
And they put in some new chain
You know it's so good to see you
Man, your hair had got so long
It feels like it's been forever
Used to sing you that old song
With you sitting right next to me, your hand in the wind
In that old white Cherokee I grew up in
Yeah, it's crazy
Crazy 'cause it's true
Well, you know they say that growing up is hard
It's so hard to think of how we almost got so far
Do you remember on the night of our first kiss'
Baby, didn't it feel just a little bit like this'
With you sitting right next to me, your hand in the wind
In that old white Cherokee I grew up in
Yeah, it's crazy
Crazy 'cause it's true
That you never get a second chance at the first time
We will never be eighteen again
No, you never get a second chance at the first time
It's so good to see you my old friend
It's good to see you again
Can you believe it' How much everything has changed'
Well, they shut down the old diner
And they put in some new chain
You know it's so good to see you
Man, your hair had got so long
It feels like it's been forever
Used to sing you that old song
With you sitting right next to me, your hand in the wind
In that old white Cherokee I grew up in
Yeah, it's crazy
Crazy 'cause it's true<start>It's been a long time comin'
But I think I've got it figured out
Sometimes the easiest things are still
The hardest ones to learn about
Well I was strugglin' so hard for my freedom
And it was there all the time
But I just couldn't see it
I think I found myself
I think I found what I'm lookin' for
I think I found myself
(Don't you know)
I think I found what I'm lookin' for
Well I got sidetracked somewhere
Though I really can't recall just when
I lost my inspiration
And I couldn't get it back again
(No)
I trusted everyone else so completely
Well I was deaf, dumb and blind
But I'll be damned if I'll let 'em defeat me
I think I found myself
(Don't you know)
I think I found what I'm lookin' for
I think I found myself
(Don't you know)
I think I found what I'm lookin' for
I'm tired of tricks and politics
And futures burning bright
I'm on the line and out of time
For once in my life
I'm gonna do what I think is right
I think I found myself
(Don't you know)
I think I found what I'm lookin' for
I think I found myself
I think I found what I'm lookin' for<start>I can feel the time closing in
I can feel the years crawling through my skin
And if I doubt myself I can count on the rain
To cover the tears of this aging game
But I can count on you to play your part
I don't miss a beat of your animal heart
And when you push from behind I know I can
Cover a mountain with the palm of my hand
And oh babe, you can make history young again
You could rewrite, you could decide
The things that should or shouldn't have been
You could look at me in the scheme of things
Oh babe, you could make history young again
I can watch the weeks sweeping by
I can recollect the hearts hanging out to dry
When the world shuts down I can touch my fears
I can hear lost youth ringing in my ears
But I lost nothing when I gained you
You just blew me away with yesterdays news
When you run your fingers down my spine
It's like throwing a switch on the hands of time
Ancient minds, ancient lives
Got a way of coming around
If I knew then what I know now
I'd make it back to you somehow<start>(Chant)
As years drift by
and future dies.
1. He sits and he thinks
about all he's done in life,
I'm now an old man,
what have I been in life?
what did I do?
Had no end to aspire to.
2. His dreams as a boy
were of hope and intention
of making his mark
with his plans and invention,
where did they go,
how could he know how time goes.
In my day had to have
certain future,
but now you can do as you like,
all that I might have wanted,
seeking what you're after,
but not for me.
Everything comes to those who wait,
I thought everything may come to me
made my way only as I was able.
3. He knows there's no more he can do,
no romances, now bitten today
for they have all his chances,
all too late, no one waits
how time goes by.
Seeking what you're after,
but not for me
Have as my years drift by
never for me.<start>So you're tired and beat
And you've worked all week
And you need a place you can let it go.
Where the girls go wild
And the boys play hard
And you need a little more than just the radio.
Well here's your open invitation
With just a couple regulations.
Let me warn you son, only come to have fun
We don't take kindly to serious.
So leave your troubles at the door
Unless you want some in here.
Welcome to my house, buckle up tight
Everybody sings and drinks, laughs and gets high.
It's a country music, a little soul,
It's a rock 'n roll rodeo.
We don't tolerate no sitting around
Everybody's dancin', groovin' and getting on down.
So before you come in here with some kind of attitude
You better read the house rules.
Around eleven o'clock when the front door locks
And the boys start raising the bottle.
Where the girls do the thing with the Mardis Gras beads
Yeah, You know they're gonna show 'em if they got 'em.
No matter what your story, a good time is mandatory.
Well rule number seven says don't touch the women
But they can grab whatever they want to.
Welcome to my house, buckle up tight
Everybody sings and drinks, laughs and gets high.
It's a country music, a little soul,
It's a rock' n roll rodeo.
We don't tolerate no sitting around
Everybody's dancing,' groovin' and getting on down.
So before you come in here with some kind of attitude
You better read the house rules.
No such thing as last call.
We pick' em up when they fall .
We share the same bathroom stall,
Says the sign on the wall.

Never let no woman abuse me
Never let no woman misuse me
Never let no woman confuse me
Never laid my money down
Little woman think I got a heart of stone
'cause I just wanna love' em and leave' em alone
Money down!
Lotta funky women been tryin' to scare me
Tell me that they'll leave me if I ain't true
Ain't been a one who didn't have to share me
Ya know that when they leave it ain't me that's blue
Little woman can't ya see I'm bound to roam
And I got no fears about livin' alone
Money down!
Little woman tryin' to put the chains on me
Till my dyin' day I'm gonna wanna be free
Sorry 'bout it baby, but that's just me!
Never let no woman abuse me
Never let no woman misuse me
Never let no woman confuse me
Never laid my money down
Little woman think I got a heart of stone

Money down!<start>I woke up this morning
And I walked down to the sea
I sat there on the long grass
Just staring at the sea
Counting all my blessing
And everything that you gave to me
Why is this complicated?
Why can't you stay with me?
Stay with me
Won't you stay
Stay with me
Won't you stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
I just like to hold on
To all the magic memories
I dread this place without you
Don't leave I'm begging please
Holding back the memories
Holding back the year
Holding back the memories
Holding back the tears
Stay with me
Won't you stay
Stay with me
Won't you stay with me
Stay with me

Stay with me<start>She was more like a beauty queen from a movie screen
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Gonna dance on the floor in the round
She says I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who would dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
Mother always told me be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do before the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who says that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and her plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
Do think twice
She told my baby and we danced till three
As she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cries
Eyes would like mine
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
Then she stood right by me
Smell her sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who says that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who says that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
So take my strong advice, and remember to always think twice
Do think twice<start>He pensado mil veces en robar caramelos
Y subirme muy alto y tirarlos pa' hacer un mundo mejor
Y que esos seÃ±ores tan feos quiten su cara de serios
Y que esto llamado planeta tenga otro sabor
He pensado mil veces en tirarles mil besos
Y una caja de abrazos pa' que se sientan mejor
Y que cambien su aburrido mensaje por otro que sea cierto
Y que esto llamado planeta tenga otro sabor
Ay! Ay! Ay!
Ay! princesa
No se que caramelo ofrecerte pa' que crezcas mejor.
Ay! Ay! Ay!
Que son todos de menta.
Y los que habÃ­a de fresa los ha retirado un seÃ±or.
He pensado mil veces en subirme hasta el cielo

Y algÃºn dÃ­a llegara el momento en que querrÃ¡n
escucharnos y entendernos y mirar mas para acÃ¡.

Que si te hacen caminar,
por el camino derecho y eso te hace ser verdad,
esos son tus caramelos, esos son tus caramelos.
Caramelos<start>Is this where the Interstate ends
In coastal towns like this?
Waiting for my world to cave under
We seem to invent ourselves
In places left unknown
If hope could only find me out
Is this the end of everything we know?
This is the end of everything I am
Is anybody out there?
Hello alone!
Broken hearts like promises
I left my last unknowns
Is anybody out there?
Hello alone!
'Cause the coldest winters thrive
The question is, I'm a Holy Ghost
In the coastal towns of Him
Although I know a thousand names
I see my only friend
I've got the ground
All I need is ten cents for the pooling
I feel helpless, sleeping at this, waiting for your return
Are you ever coming home?
Is anybody out there?
Hello alone!
Broken hearts like promises
I left my last unknowns
Is anybody out there?
Hello alone!
'Cause the coldest winters thrive
On broken hopes, broken homes
Does anybody? Do they ever listen?
Does anybody care at all?
Do they care at all? Do they care at all? Do they care at all?
Do you care at all? Do you care at all?
Is this the end of everything we know?
This is the end of everything I am
Is anybody out there?
Hello alone!
Broken hearts, like promises
I left my last unknowns
Is anybody out there?
Hello alone!
'Cause the coldest winters thrive
On broken hopes
Is anybody out there?
Hello alone!
Broken hearts, like promises
I left my last unknowns
Is anybody out there?
Hello alone!

And then we take this home<start>bu-u-u-u-u-u-rn! pop! pop!

I reckon I'm a bit too close to this one
I reckon if I touch it might just burn
flesh-heads like me just wax and melt
when my tongue touches titty's tongue in turn
sometimes pleasure heads must burn
bu-u-u-u-u-u-rn! pop! pop!
bu-u-u-u-u-u-rn! pop! pop!
my brain tricked my hands to believe they were strong
in short, my hands became clubs to grind

kiss me darling, kiss my eyes to blind
kiss my clubs and witness what my knuckles find
bu-u-u-u-u-u-rn! pop! pop!
bu-u-u-u-u-u-rn! pop! pop!
I feel a little low, you know what I mean?
buried neck-high in British snow
I reckon I'm a bit too close to this one
shoot me darling, shoot me in the head and go
ya! ya! teeth gone. follow my trail back home.
ya! ya! teeth gone. follow my trail back home.

Something to remind me I'm not dead or caught in between

Nothin' I see will make it lose sight

That now I live on a street called shame
But the sins are the sweetest part
Now no one's left to blame
And I found out that I have a taste
For the bitter fruit of life
All through this night
The choices are made
A cold wind blows
The stories are told
But your memory lingers on my breath
Like a song that burns in my soul
And I found out that I have a taste
For the bitter fruit of life
Can you hear me now
I'm calling to you

I close my eyes to see
Twelve wild horses in silver chains
Calling out to me
Oh Daytona, shine your light on me
Oh Daytona, shine your light on me
Now she ain't easy so you take good care
Or she will scream down on your lust
She can please you like no other
Or she can leave you eating dust
Oh Daytona, shine your light on me
Burning passion heat my day
Let me sit inside your wonder
Cloudless daydream, oh dance of dances
To have tamed the sound of thunder
Oh Daytona, shine your light on me
Oh Daytona, shine your light on me<start>Do you know the story
Of the shepherd who'd turn
And took the river moon in his arms
Listen to the story
Mainly if you cannot read
Of the man who loved the woman
You can tuck it up in your mind
You would like to catch the moonlight
But you know the thing is not right
For all of us have some secrets to hide
Do you know the story
Of the shepherd who'd turn
And took the river moon in his arms
Listen to the story
Mainly if you cannot read
Of the man who loved the woman
Woman was a sting in the thorn
You will get the moon for the horn
You'll try to catch it and you'll drown
Of the moon you were much too full
Nowadays... people of the mountains say:
"That the Gods put the moon high up in the sky
So that the men might not be tempted to steal it"
Do you know the story
Of the shepherd who'd turn
And took the river moon in his arms
Listen to the story
Mainly if you cannot read
Of the man who loved the woman
Round in the depths of your mind
For today the moon is too high
Shepherd tried to catch a sunrise
You might be more lucky if you try
Do you know the story
Of the shepherd who'd turn
And took the river moon in his arms
Listen to the story
Mainly if you cannot read
Of the man who loved the woman

That's turning tonight
As I slide through the streets
Moonlight and memory burning
And in my hand your broken dream
My watery eyes
I sing for you this lullaby
Let the shadow fall from your window
Let the morning light fill your head
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul 'til the night is dead
All these useless emotions
Churning round
As I search these bare walls for a clue
And all the time
The truth is flashing in my mind
That when a heart gets broken
There's nothing you can do
My watery eyes
I sing for you this lullaby
Let the shadow fall from your window
Let the morning light fill your head
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul 'til the night is dead
And I'm packing my belongings
Hey I'll be gone before the noon arrives
'Cause I know there's no use pretending
Soon it'll all be alright
But hey
Let the shadow fall from your window
Let the morning light fill your head
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul 'til the night is dead
See the dawn break gold
When the night is dead
Hear the bells<start>I had disengaged to avoid being totaled

Unencumbered daughter hit the ground running at last!
I'd invite you but I'm busy being unoppressed
I hit the ground running although I know not what toward

I felt primed and ready unsurrounded by the pawns
I felt culture shocked, but dissuaded, I was not

This is my voice
This is my taste of what you've have no part of

One day I'll double back and tell you about these unfettered years
One day I'll look back and feel something other than relieved
Glad that I left when I did before your dear, you can't got the best of me
When I'd speak of artistry you would roll your eyes skyward
When I'd speak of spirituality you label me absurd

A quarter that I should've saved
I faked a farewell fantasy and misbehaved
I never made an effort
My conscience went
After all the time I spent
The dollars that I dropped on you
Thought you'd say you miss me too
So here I am, a friend, the end
I meant to disregard that birthday card
Nailed upon your wall he sent
I meant to turn my eyes from everything
I shouldn't see
An oath I took, you kissed my cheek
Cried yourself to sleep
Never would you admit to me
I always laughed when you laughed
Cried when you cried
Danced when you danced
I lied
Laughed when you laughed
Cried when you cried
Danced when you danced
I lied
San Francisco payphone, so far from home
So many friends, and I'm alone
I faked a farewell fantasy
I lied, you bother me
My conscience gone
This conversation's dragging on
There was once upon a time
When you would miss me too
So here I am, a friend, the end
I meant to disregard that birthday card
Nailed upon your wall he sent
I meant to turn my eyes from everything
Never made a promise
An oath I took, I kissed your cheek
Cried myself to sleep
I won't admit that you see
I always laughed when you laughed
Cried when you cried
Danced when you danced
I lied
Laughed when you laughed
Cried when you cried
Danced when you danced
I lied
I lied
I lied

Drinking alone on the prow
Chasing your Bourbon with Tennessee gin
The big game's about to begin
Riverboat gambler
Hiding that Ave up your sleeve
I can see through all that debonaire style
The irony bending your smile
And I won't tip your hand
I won't do you in
I want to stay near you
I want you to win
Riverboat gambler
You can defy all the odds
You can draw diamonds to fill out your flush
You can find someone to trust
And I won't steal your chips
I won't steal your pride
Won't you take me on faith
Won't you let me inside

Under our velvet and lace
You're an old vagabond, I'm a poor waif
Let's make a place that's safe

Come on and let me inside<start>Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see
T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
Oh how precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see
Shall I be wafted to the skies
On flowery beds of ease
While others strive to win the prize
And sail on bloody seas<start>She's fat, she's a slut
She told me I had a cute butt
Right away I fell for her
She made me feel so secure

I don't mind her being fat
But she told me a big white lie
How could I look her in the eye
She told me that she loved me
Was it just a lie?
Now she's with someone else
She waved me goodbye
Now that time has passed
I can't seem to get her off my mind
They say the pain will go away
It's just a matter of time<start>Tvolrl rkeztem

Where we can sleep and waters still run deep
And you're the one that sails into me
And you're the one whose lips are silent
You're the one that always said
There's only one forever
It brought us both together,
There's only one forever
You said to me, just give me honesty
And in return, I'll build your santuary
Long ago, that path was chosen
How could we not fall in love
Remember when we always said
There's only one forever
It brought us both together
There's only one forever
You're the one that sails into me
You're the one whose lips are silent
You're the one that always said

As a friend I flew a long way for a friend
But the way you treated me
Made me feel like giving in
I don't know if I'll break or only bend
You're supposed to be my friend
And if you carry on the way you did today
All the music in my veins will turn to stone
All the faking of your friendship
Doesn't make it anyway
Does it get you off to act so all alone
It'll chill you to the bone
So my advice to you is not to take advice
From the dealers who are handing out the cards
Take your life into your own hand
Just have faith in who you are
And all your goodness that I'm forced to disregard
Because you make it much to hard.<start>Speak to me
I'm hanging on your words.
Give to me
The love that I deserve.
But still you're going to hold your tongue
And torture me by playing dum.
Have you no idea what you've done
And what you're doing still.
Every word you say, kills me and steals my romance.
Every vacant stare that you throw at me steals my romance.
No more lies.
No more here nor there.
The time has come
To show me that you care.
But still you're going to turn in me.
And bring me down onto my knees.
Have you no idea just how to please me?
I just want to breathe.
Every word you say, kills me and steals my romance.
Every vacant stare that you throw at me steals my romance.
Never here nor there you just stand there and steal my romance.
Every hallow prayer when you kneel down and steal my romance.
Every word you say...<start>Waiting till the sun goes down

Living in a fantasy
In and out of dreams
Nothing is the way it seems
Let me go home,

Let me go home,

Every way I turn my eyes
Shadows pass in the night
Haunted by reality
Living out of dreams

Let me go home,
I had a bad night leave me alone

Felt so disconnected
You've got me running on empty

I started looking and the bubble burst
I started looking for excuses
Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign
When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so
A warning sign
It came back to haunt me, and I realized
That you were an island and I passed you by
When you were an island to discover
Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign
When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is

And you don't hear a sound
You can look all around and see...

I wanna be with you
That's what I wanna do
'cause you're so out of sight
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
That's what I wanna do
Well I lost my job at the texaco station
Instead of pumpin' gas I dreamed of you
I got thrown out of my house
I got such a bad reputation
'cause all I wanna do is be seen with you
They gave me my pay and said walk
I don't care what they say
Go ahead and let 'em all talk
Until the world falls apart
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you

Until they rip out my heart
I wanna be with you

All night, a little bit more

And she danced and she danced all night
She danced and she danced
And she danced and she danced all night
She had a dress of many colors
She wore it in an Eastern way
She stepped into the spotlight
She took my breath away
Golden chains around her ankles
The tiny, tiny feet were bare
Bells on her fingers and toes
Music in the air
She crossed the floor
Like a shadow on a summer's night
The hair was black as jet
Her skin was white as white
She crossed the floor
Like a shadow on a summers night
And she danced and she danced
And she danced and she danced all night
Tiny hands struck the air
Like the wings of a bird in flight
And she danced and she danced
And she danced and she danced all night<start>Everybody has been burned before
Everybody knows the pain
Anyone in this place
Can tell you to your face
Why you shouldn't try to love someone
Everybody know it never works
Everybody knows, and me
I know that door
That shuts just before
You get to the dream you see
I know all too well
How to turn, how to run
How to hide behind a bitter wall of blue
But you die inside if you choose to hide
So I guess instead I'll love you<start>Look at us baby, up all night
Tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people who live
Through years in the dark?
Ahh
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why
When we get crazy
It just ain't to right (try to keep you head little girl)
Girl I get lonely too
You don't have to worry
Just hold on tight (don't get caught in your little world)
Cause I love you
Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
We make it harder than it has to be
And I can't tell you why
No, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why
No, no, baby, I can't tell you why

I can't tell you why<start>What a splendid mess!
O the Scientist, and his Genesis
He overlooks my gift and then I think
She's the only who knows what I could have done
I must be patient.
They will realize what I know inside.
I was meant to lead this world to greater things
It's my destiny
Everything seems to fade when I see her face
The sky and trees all blur every time I look at her
Nobody understood me till her eyes fixed upon me
My puzzle life's complete, now that I've found the missing piece
Don't you worry, boy, it's a waste of time
Place your hand on mine, untie your mind
We'll just float away into the day
You're not the only one who thinks they're falling in love
You must be patient
They will realize what I see inside
You were meant to lead this world to greater things
It's your destiny
Everything seems to fade when I see her face
The sky and trees all blur every time I look at her
Nobody understood me till her eyes fixed upon me
My puzzle life's complete, now that I've found the missing piece
O, you're the meaning
Nidria, please listen, I'd like to explain
I should have told you sooner, it's been gnawing at my brain
My mind's in knots, it's got me lost,
Please help me through the maze
'Cause you're the key, the lock turning,
The breaking of these chains
Everything seems to fade when I see his face
It seems all the stars turn down every time I look at him
Nobody understood me till his eyes fixed upon me
My puzzle life's complete, now that I've found the missing piece
Everything seems to fade when I see her face
The sky and trees all blur every time I look at her
Nobody understood me till her eyes fixed upon me
My puzzle life's complete, now that I've found the missing piece

And the country needs him, she's got more ships to fleet
Oh, I'll go down yelling or quiet if you like
But please spare the admiral, you see, I've got no lives to lead to the sea
DON'T TRY TO TELL ME WHO TO SAVE OR KILL
I'VE GOT MY OWN MIND, YOU KNOW
AND I'LL DO WHAT I WILL
I'LL DO WHAT I WILL
YOU KNOW, I WILL!
I'LL KILL THE CAPTAIN IF IT'S HIS TIME, MY BOY
I'LL TAKE THE ADMIRAL TOO, AND IF YOU'RE NOT COOL
I'LL TAKE YOU.
I'm sorry, Lord, you know what's best, but please would you at least spare the cook?
I'm very hungry, and by the looks of this ship
I'm gonna starve!
I'm gonna starve!
Well the ship went down
To the bottom of the sea
And the only ones left
Were the fat cook and me
So I looked to the sky with a smile
In my eye
Caught a glimpse of the Dude
And started singing
I'm sorry Lord that I doubted you
Oh, babe you really came through
And I thank you, I thank you!!
I thank you
I thank you ... Lord<start>She never had an education
She uses life as her vocation
Standing on ledges clinging to the edges
The world's a hard place to land on
She has this one way conversation
Trying to avoid a confrontation
Memories of the kind she's rather leave behind
The worlds' a hard place to land on
Life can be lonely can be very sad
Can be something you wish you never had
She never had any affection
So she relates well to rejection
No stories wait discovery
Dreams have passed recovery
The worlds a hard place to land on
She just sleeps all day
In her squalid little slum
And takes little white pills
To make her body feel numb
And it's dark and dirty
And there's nothing left to eat
And in her heart there's a feeling of defeat
Smells of bus and fornication
And a bottle of cheat scent
Should she stick around
If this is all that life meant
Life can be lonely can be very sad
Can be something you wish you never had

Pyrteen nielun reunalla - niinkuin ennenkin
Vaihtuu hahmot ansalla
Vaan ei meininki
Totuus riippuu nkkulmasta
Ei voi tuulta ennustaa
Saa mieli hohtamaan kullalta kaiken mink tahtoo
Kuin enteen vaarasta
Tuoksuna ilmassa
Hetke ennen myrskyn aikaa
Kuin kosketus otsalla
Rakkaasi huulilla
Kertoen ettei milloinkaan en
Pyrteen nielun reunalla - niinkuin ennenkin
Vaihtuu hahmot ansalla
Vaan ei meininki
Tahdon nhd kaiken mutten koskaan mistn maksaa hintaa
Pyrteen nielun reunalla - niinkuin ennenkin
Vaihtuu hahmot ansalla
Vaan ei meininki<start>Love and communication you were here for me
At this very moment 'cuz I found you on the phone
You called me
And you were not hunting me
Learning more and more about less and less and less
On the edge of your seat in some dark movie
Can you memorize the scenes
They'll be different next week
Can you tell me can you tell can you tell
If there is something better
'Cuz you know there always is
There always is
Drawn to the party like a spider filling up your guts
Don't hate the night with what you shouldn't have
Come along for the ride you just know you should
You just know you should
Can you tell me can you tell can you tell
If there is something better
'Cuz you know there always is
There always is
Hated to see you sad when I left
There's just no good in that but the good part was
That I came at all 'cuz I don't venture out
Into the lives of the new
I want you to come along for the ride
How long will you stay for your whole life
You just know you should
Can you tell me can you tell can you tell
If there is something better

A thousand miles away from home sleeping in the rain
I walked up to the brakeman and give him a line of talk
He said if you've got money I'll see that you don't walk
I haven't got a nickel not one penny can I show
Get off get off you railroad bum and he slammed that boxcar door (yodel)
He put me off in Texas a place I dearly love
Wide open spaces all around me and the moon and stars up above
Well nobody seems to want me nor to lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from Frisco going back to Dixie Land
Though my pocketbook is empty and my heart is full of pain

eaten things that youve disgarded
but i wont be forever watching the shit you do
ive slept in horror and drank the terror from your cup of lies
and now im sick of you
and in these alleyways and ditches ive seen bodyparts dismembered
remains of your selfish lives
too long have i stayed in the shadows
always watching, growing stronger
and now i will rise
now that these alleyways and ditches burn a hole into existance
i will be forever tearing it open
and if this wound is in need of stitches
just know that i wont let you sew it shut
because i cant let you forget<start>Yes I believe it's killing me, this standing still
Lets start today.
That's what we said and we go on...
To never move from where we are
With eyes closed we're falling (this time, or... in life)
Far more said than done
These days fly by we watch them go
With so much wasted time
It seems we pass it sitting down
No heart to try, we move through life just waiting here
No will to win, and then give in again so we remain...
Lets start today.
That's what we said, now lets move on.<start>I been searchin' for so long
For a love to fill my life--soldier me on
Feel the hunger in my blood
As I walk into the fire I can't get enough
Where, oh where can I find you
I have seen you and called your name
Walked the streets of my life in vain
Seen the idols with feet of clay
Pull me closer--push me away
Where, oh where can I find you
Where, oh where
Times have taught me to use my time
Journey's end is an endless climb
...when to follow and when to lead...
When to know just what I need
Where you gone g.o.d.
Have you gone down on me--don'tcha do
I ain't ready for no second-hand love
I'm no stranger to this loneliness
Leave me lonely--leave me lost
Leave me nothin' but myself to carry the cost
Now the only, only reason to come to you again
You gotta fight to win your freedom--lose your chains
Love's illusions ring all too clear
Cross my mind when I hold you near
Know your pleasure--you leave me cold
Lonely nights with my thoughts untold
Where, oh where can I find you
Where, do ya care
I don't care what the price may be
'down' is right when you're down with me
Can you tell me--am I to blame
Sing my song to your heart's refrain
Where ya gone g.o.d.
Have you run out on me-don'tcha do
All you give me is second-hand love
All I wanna do is get on down with you
All I ask for and all I pray
Meet you down on the streets one day
Have you taste life from on your knees
Hear me callin' ya 'help me, please'<start>Am I a toy to you with strings around my fingers
For you to pull and watch as I collapsed when you want?
The coldest night to me is a switch that you control
Tip toe around your words just to calm you down again
Theres too many people that we both love
And too many secrets I dont wanna know
Youre still chasing him
My saving grace is saving face, lost on the back burner
Good for, good for you
My saving grace is saving face, I just sit and wait
Theres always just enough of you to pull me back
But I can see your eyes drifting past what you have
Im flagging down a ship when its on its way to sea
The horn is blaring out but I just dont want to leave
I never left you in a sandstorm
I never left you for a second at all
Youre still chasing him
My saving grace is saving face, lost on the back burner
Good for, good for you
My saving grace is saving face, I just sit and wait
I thought you were an angel
I guess you were a vulture
Either way spread your wings and just fly away
I thought you were an angel

Like a fire in the cavernous darkness at the heart of the beast
With my beliefs and possessions, stopped at the frontier in my chest
At the edge of my country, my back to the sea, looking east
Where the search for the truth is conducted with a wink and a nod
And where power and position are equated with the grace of God
These times are famine for the soul while for the senses it's a feast
From the edge of my country, as far as you see, looking east
Hunger in the midnight, hunger at the stroke of noon
Hunger in the mansion, hunger in the rented room
Hunger on the TV, hunger on the printed page
And there's a God-sized hunger underneath the laughing and the rage
In the absence of light
And the deepening night
Where I wait for the sun
Looking east
How long have I left my mind to the powers that be
How long will it take to find the higher power moving in me
Power in the insect
Power in the sea
Power in the snow falling silently
Power in the blossom
Power in the stone
Power in the song being sung alone
Power in the wheat field
Power in the rain
Power in the sunlight and the hurricane
Power in the silence
Power in the flame
Power in the sound of the lover's name
The power of the sunrise and the power of a prayer released
On the edge of my country, I pray for the ones with the least
Hunger in the midnight, hunger at the stroke of noon
Hunger in the banquet, hunger in the bride and groom
Hunger on the TV, hunger on the printed page
And there's a God-sized hunger underneath the questions of the age
And an absence of light
In the deepening night
Where I wait for the sun
Looking east<start>This time is real,
I feel it passing through the telephone,
No one is home now,
No one is home.
These stacks,
They keep me down,
So I build some more.
America is just a word but I use it.
Language keeps me locked and repeating.
This time is real,
I see it passing by the avenue,
Nothing to do now,
There's nothing to do.
I see them spinning on,
So I spin out.

With the wisdom of an old man

Where you gonna fall?

You just can't have it all
He's your oldest and your best friend
If you need him, he'll be there again
He's always willing to be second-best

And realize
You just can't have it all
You just can't have it all

He won't complain if he's caught in a freeze
He'll always ask, he'll always say please

Never take it all

And faster when you fall

This is where their story ends
No one knows where they went from here
But I remember when they drank a toast
To the route that no one else had tried
Working up along the western ridge
Where the watershed divides
Way up there, they found their
Place in the sky
Around the fire, we told the tales
Of how they'd cut it close before
And wandered lost after the avalanche
But stumbled back to camp at dawn
But now it's much too long to hold the hope
The glacier ice can echo deep
I thought, I felt a tug along the rope
And it pulled me from my sleep
Working up along the western ridge
Where the watershed divides
Way up there, they found their
Place in the sky
The air is clear and the ice is blue
You can see from down below
That curling up over the eastern side
Is a silent plume of snow
Working up along the western ridge
Where the watershed divides
Way up there, they found their
Place in the sky
Way up there, they found their
Place in the sky<start>Sit back and open fire
With legs until desires
Sit back and open fire
Sit back and just retire
Sit back and open fire
Sit back and
Live in submission, live in a choice
It never meant that much to me
Without permission, without a voice
I only live when I cant breathe
We couldnt kiss, we couldnt fight
We couldnt wait for tomorrow
Without a fist, without a fight
We waited for no tomorrow
Sorry
Im not sorry
Sorry to live my life this way
Sorry to let myself decay
Sorry
Im not sorry
Sorry to live my life this way
Sorry to let myself decay
Sit back and open fire
Sit back and
It didnt kill us, the pleasure did
Infected from the things I did
Rip off the willing, rip off the tried
Slip in beds and open fire
Right now, let it be known
And right now just leave me alone
That its too close for you cause its too close for me
It meant nothing to you, it was nothing to me
Sorry
Im not sorry
Sorry to live my life this way
Sorry to let myself decay
Sorry
Im not sorry
Sorry to live my life this way
Sorry to let myself decay

Sit back and
Right now
Just let them open fire
Right now
Just let them open fire
Right now
Just let them open fire
Right now
Just let them open wide
Right now

Right now

And I looked out across the town
I got the urge to move again
I guess I'll never settle down
We talked about things getting better
But they still looked the same to me
Could be a near sighted heart
Seein' what it wants to see
So take me to the highway
Take me far from here
These days I'm not seein' anything too clear
Nothin' seems to move fast enough
When time isn't on your side
Can't seem to keep the wheels in motion
No matter how hard you try
I need another point of view
Someplace I've never seen
Keepin' my eyes wide open
Goin' where I've never been
So take me to the highway
Take me far from here
These days I'm not seein' anything too clear
I've been lookin' for an answer
And I've got a long way to go
But when I reach that place
I know I'll find what I'm lookin' for<start>Instrumental<start>Oh gentlemen
Swallow your prayers
Because the wind makes a mockery of men
Your soul becomes a fish
You swim in idle waters
And drink other fishes piss
Your soul feeds on fish
On piss, puss and men
Who in turn, become as you have become
A fish
No, not even that, but a symbol of fish
Hooked by the baby flesh of maggots
A ripple of life in tin
This tin could become your world too
So choose between this and water
Choose between tin and piss
Do you still feel thirsty now
Are you thirsty now
Are you thirsty now
Do you still feel
Thirsty
Thirsty now<start>Well, I'm the crawlin' king snake

She saw the prison inside
She cursed her keeper
And swore she'd get free
Every time I see
I got my hands wrapped around the bars
I want out right now
She led an angel's life
On angel's wings
Jumped out her apartment window
And hit the street below
Every time I see
I got my hands wrapped around the bars
I can't shut off my mind
And now I've waited, my hands are wrapped around the bars
I'm burning, my soul is pushed against the bars
The bars, the lies, the lies, lies, lies
Are trapped behind the bars
My mind hates my body
My body hates my soul
I close my eyes and fight
Inside my own black hole
Every time I see
I got my hands wrapped around the bars
I want out right now!
I've lived my life
I'm doing my time
I realize life's lie
Every time I see
I got my hands wrapped around the bars
I can't shut off my mind
And now I'm waiting, my hands are wrapped around the bars
I'm burning, my soul is pushed against the bars
The bars, the lies, the lies, lies, lies
They're trapped behind my eyes<start>I, I went to hell, I might as well learn by my mistakes

Someday we gonna dance with those lions
Someday we gonna break free from these chains and keep on flyin'
They tellin' me it's all good just wait
You know you're gonna be there someday
Sippin' on Jim Beam ok
Gotta get these things one day
Till then do another line you know
Searching for that other high
Stop or I gotta steal then steal
Kill or I'm gonna be killed
I got a sack in my pocket
Conscious yellin' drop it
You know we're gonna lose it someday
And we tryin' to hold it all together
But the devil is too clever so
I'm gonna die you gonna die we gonna die
Someday one day I said
Someday we gonna rise up on that wind you know
Someday we gonna dance with those lions
Someday we gonna break free from these chains and keep on flyin'
Try to lie but it ain't me
Ain't me try to look but I can't see
Can't stop right now cause I'm too far
And I can't keep goin' cause it's too hard
In the day in the night it's the same thing
On the field on the block it's the same game
On the real if you stop then it's no pain
But if you can't feel pain then it's no gain
Rearrange and you change and it's all bad
And you try to maintain but you fall back
And you crawl and you slip and you slide down
want to make it to the top better start now
So I hold my soul and I die hard
All alone in the night in the graveyard
Someday one day I'm gonna be free
And they won't try to kill me for being me
Hey someday
Someday we gonna rise up on that wind you know
Someday we gonna dance with those lions
Someday we gonna break free from these chains and keep on flyin'
If you know how this is
Gonna see it's not that easy
Don't stop get it till it's done
From where you are or have begun
I said keep on try a little harder
To see everything you need to be
Believe in your dreams
That you see when you're asleep
Someday we gonna rise up on that wind you know
Someday we gonna dance with those lions
Someday we gonna break free from these chains and keep on flyin'<start>I must have been confused or vain

You know none is no way to be
You must go for all
Go for all and all will set you free
If you continue to wallow noneconscious and hollow
Nonetheless go for all and allness will follow
All like gravity, is there all the time?
Applehead Newton was a figment of mind
Run far and wide but you can't hide
We're all we got no sense of pride
All won't exercise undue force
Or engage in somenatious intercourse
Allulations to the all worthy
All is all you need
It's the fifth primary color
It's the number between zero and infinity
Some would have you settle for itself
When all is in your grasp
When I was young I wallowed in none
You know none is no way to be
Now I go for all
Go for all and all will set you free
Don't mistake all for love or hate
It's not like any other mental state
It's the total extent when nothing else remains
The utmost possible of possible gains
There'll be no selfishness, evil or greed
All don't care about your race or creed
All is all you have to do
'Cause anything else would be A.U.
Allulations to the all worthy
All is all you need

It's the number between zero and infinity
Some would have you settle for itself

Then I receive a revallation
It made me re evalluate my way of life
I allivated my outlook
Some said I had allterior motives
They were right
My life started all over again
It's all up to you but are you up to all?
Ye must quest all
Lest ye become some full
Or something of a none skull
Saying something that is nonsense<start>And He set me on fire, and I am burning alive
With His breath in my lungs I am coming undone
And he set me on fire and I am burning alive
With his breath in my lungs I am coming undone
And I cannot hold it in and remain composed
Love's taken over me and so I propose the letting myself go
I am letting myself go
You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy
Everlasting, your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending, your glory goes beyond all fame
And the cry of my heart is to bring you praise
From the inside out
Lord my soul cries out
Everlasting, your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending, your glory goes beyond all fame
And the cry of my heart is to bring you praise
From the inside out
Lord my soul cries out<start>Holy, Holy, Rocket

Too late
Too late<start>i don't really care, what they say i don't really care, what they do i just know i'm sick of this crowd and of you the cops they took me and beat me blue it wasn't what i was or what i do it was just being alive on my own side i took a chance on the other side got off this downhill slide stopped wastin' my time why don't you? had a dream saw a scheme saw a man hang on a beam next thing was, i woke up screaming! i wasn't dreaming. it wasn't what i was or what i do it wasn't anything to do with you it was just, just, being alive. took a chance on the other side got off this downhill slide stopped wastin' my time. why don't you?<start>We don't need no burning crosses
Put out the fire of bigotry
We don't need to count our losses
When they bury you, they'll bury me
I have a dream that we can be united
It will only work when fears are subsided
By the sweat of my brow I won't let it happen
Freedom for our heart's is my battle cry
Poor man beggin' at a rich man's feet
He eats the crumbs off of the floor
We are starving for something to eat
We are whales up on the shore
We're living in troubled times
We're living in troubled times
How could we be so blind
We're living in troubled times
There was a time we tore our country down
For the same reasons there we fight for now
And if pride comes before a fall
Then why tell me why we tore down the wall
We're living in troubled times
We're living in troubled times
Troubled times
We're living in troubled times
How could we be so blind
We're living in troubled times
Troubled
Troubled
Troubled<start>I met a man locked away
For things he hadn't done
Innocence on a ball and chain
He'll never feel the sun
Again on his face or roses
In his hands but when he smiled
At me I could understand
If you're free you'll never see the walls
If your head is clear you'll never free fall
If you're right you'll never fear wrong
If your head is high you'll never fear at all
There was a daughter of a man
Who took his life too young
She swore she'd never do the same
Then did just what he'd done
And a boy who's gone insane
Voices in his head
No one knows what they say
Now his mother's dead
If you're free you'll never see the walls
If your head is clear you'll never free fall
If you're right you'll never fear wrong
If your head is high you'll never fear at all
There was a man who had a face
That looked alot like me
I saw him in the mirror and
I fought him in the street
And when he turned away
I shot him in the head
Then came to realize
I had killed myself
If you're free you'll never see the walls
If your head is clear you'll never free fall
If you're right you'll never fear wrong
If your head is high you'll never fear at all<start>Sister jane has a little book
Full of autographs of useless people
Seems a waste in the time she took
And it gets me mad which makes us equal
Ooh, hundreds of people left out in the cold
Wearing the shoes that were silver and gold
Useless information
Tons of useless information
Seems to fill my head
With nowhere else to go
(isn't it amazing)
Mrs. pain at the dairy game
With the news about her operation
Will the... ever make the rain
Wash away such useless information
Chorus
Isn't it amazing
Now you can see why conversation is dying
And time is passing you by
Turn your ears to the weatherman
Saying it be colder in december
Get your boots and your....
It's been the same for years
So I remember
Chorus
Chorus
Hundreds of people filling my head with useless information
Chorus<start>Well you ask me 'bout the clothes I wear
And you ask me why I grow my hair
And you ask me why I'm in a band
I dig doin' one night stands
And you want to see me do my thing
All you gotta do is plug me into high
I said high
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, high voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll
Well you ask me why I like to dance
And you ask me why I like to sing
And you ask me why I like to play
I got to get my kicks some way
And you ask me what I'm all about
Come and let me hear you shout high
I said high
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, high voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll
I said high, I said high
Waaaah
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, high voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll
Spotlight, put the lights out, happy hour
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
Wine, women and song
High voltage, high voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll<start>It's the closing hour
I don't want to go
But I could stay afloat
In your eyes
I've seen the rocks
Where everyone gets lost
I won't stray across
The white line
Let's admit, the world don't turn around us
It's acting like we don't exist
A drunk that's sleeping in the corner
Sweet dreams, make waves, find bliss
When elephants come down
To the water hole at dusk
They feel the same as us about life
We all take a drink
The sun begins to sink
The alligator waits for his time
Let's admit, the world don't turn around us
It's acting like we don't exist
A drunk that's sleeping in the corner
Sweet dreams, make waves, find bliss
You don't have to say a word
You don't have to say a word
I hear what you're thinking
You don't have to say a word
You don't have to say a word
I know what you're thinking
I know there's no use
So lost and discontent
I'm looking for a friend I can trust
For all my intent
It hasn't happened yet
So now I come to you for insight
Let's admit, the world don't care about us
It's acting like we don't exist
A drunk that's sleeping in the corner
Sweet dreams, make waves, find bliss
Sweet dreams, make waves, find bliss<start>Open the door, I've gotten lost again
Don't leave me alone, determined to hasten the end
We share it all
We throw around the blame
We can foresee the fall
So why not delay the rain
Chorus
I won't go, I won't leave, I will let it lie
I won't even blame you
We're out of luck, we're out of time
We can't lay the blame
I may be wrong, but something is on tonight
A reason to fight, a reason to pacify
We never mean the ugly the things we say
If this is the best we'll ever see,
Well that's something to save
Chorus
How long do you care to be right?
And sit all alone in your might
Nothing good, nothing gained when we know
the Blame grows old
Chorus<start>Girl have you ever been hungry
So hungry that you had no pride?
Well I got that feeling
That biting, gnawing deep inside
It's a funny pain
One I can't explain
You gotta help me girl
Help me girl
Cause I'm going insane
I know about all the good things
And what that long green stuff can buy
Right or wrong it's a groove girl
Yet somehow I'm not satisfied
You gotta show me the way
Turn my night into day
You gotta help me girl
Help me girl
Cause I'm going insane
Oh, I need someone
Someone to comfort me
Be my someone
Be my reality girl
You gotta show me the way
And turn my night into day
Help me girl
Help me girl
Cause I'm going insane
Oh, Help me girl
Help me
Baby
Help me girl
In need your love
I need your love so bad
Help me<start>You were the mother of three girls so sweet
That storm through your turnstile, and climbed to the street
But after conception, your body lay cold
Withered through Autumn then you found yourself old
Can you tell me why have been so sad
He took a lover on a far away beach,
While you arranged flowers and chose color schemes
Can you tell me why you have been so sad?
Can you tell me why you have been so sad?
The girls were all there; they traded their vows.
The youngest one glared with furrowed brow as
They tenderly kissed and cut the cake.
The bride then tripped and broke the vase,
The one you thought would span the years,
So perfectly placed below the mirror
Arriving late, you clean the debris
And walked into the angry sea;
It felt just like falling in love again.
And it felt just like falling in love again.<start>You drive me crazy, I'm so into you
Tell me baby, do you feel it too?
And the taste of your lips got me feeling high
Girl, I swear you're an angel in disguise
Just one look in your eyes got me hypnotized
I'll never be the same
'Cause I'm lost in love, lost in love
And I don't wanna be found
Lost in love
So glad I've found you girl
So let's stay lost in love
Hearts beat faster, I don't know what to do
I can't stop feeling what I'm feeling for you
And the taste of your lips got me feeling high
Girl, I swear you're an angel in disguise
Just one look in your eyes got me mesmerized
C'mon let's run away
'Cause I'm lost in love, lost in love
And I don't wanna be found
Lost in love
So glad I've found you girl
So let's stay lost in love
Lost in love
So let's stay lost in love
Lost in love
And I don't wanna be found
Lost in love
So glad I've found you girl
So let's stay lost in love
Jake Miller, yeah
Call the FBI, call the CIA
'Cause I'm lost in love, I'm MIA
No GPS, 'cause baby you're my compass
I could show you the world like Christopher Columbus
Baby you ain't even gotta worry 'bout a thing now
Give a star line talking bout Ringo
Let's run away, don't make a sound
'Cause I'm lost in love, I don't wanna be found
'Cause I'm lost in love, lost in love
And I don't wanna be found
Lost in love
So glad I've found you girl
So let's stay lost in love
Lost in love
So let's stay lost in love
Lost in love
And I don't wanna be found
Lost in love
So glad I've found you girl
So let's stay lost in love
Tell me baby, do you feel it too?<start>I look at you
And that's a dancer drinking
What a mess
A drink record lipstick
You've made a joke
Do you hear me laughing?
Get out my face
Before I loose my patience
Oh me and you
Let's cut the story
And when I'm gone
It takes a lot to shake me
So shake it,
It's the battle in me
It's the battle in you
It's a battle in me
It's a bloody war
Of patricians
Let's see which one of us
Is gonna least the ?
Cause I hear voices of my witch
Surround me
And I'll be down
If I'm done
Why ride the place?
Why ride the ? stop spinning
?
I want something to happen
So make it happen
It's the battle in you
It's a battle in me
Let's take a torch
Through the past to the future
?
See how it feels
With the passing warning
We'll be down
When we're done
Shake it, shake it
Shake it up
Shake it, shake it
Shake it up
Cause it's the battle in you
It's the battle in me
It's the battle in you
It's a battle in me
Shake it, shake it
Shake it up
Shake it, shake it
Shake it up<start>Some people stuck on struggle
Have to fight for what they are
Suffer through a day to day job
That only gets them half as far
Some use it to get closer
To fulfilling their lifes dream
Some lazily just sit back
And attempt to win at the lottery
I'm going to try my luck and see
What that reveals
I never tried my best so
I don't know how that feels
Couldn't it be
Or would you ever believe
How I would live so free
If I were to win at the lottery
You can't compare an effortless gamble
With a consistent valiant try
It's like buying a ticket and when you lose
You sit and wonder why the next problem for
You to deal with
What does the future hold for you
You don't know how to do anything
Never learned never needed to<start>Sell your car and buy a boat, its not that far away.
It won't be long if I'm not wrong well be dead or sailin on.
The countdown started years ago, the warning signs are here,
And this is one, when the big one comes Ill be safe in knowing fear.
They couldn't touch me anyway.
Can't sleep
Can't talk too
You know were runnin' out of time
Can't sleep
Can't talk too
You know were runnin' out of time
Save yourself its all in doubt, the world might end today.
For every right there's a lot gone wrong, still we made here today,
Its all we really know for sure its all we've ever known.
Were part of the problem now, only know what we've been shown.
If paranoia keeps you sane.<start>Come on now the curtain is drawn
And tomorrow stands before you
Dressed and draped in a cold black cape
Like a crow he ignores you
Look again there's a beautiful girl
Covers sin in a holy land shroud
It's the great disappearing act
Done once again for the marveled crowd
As we're chasing our tails
And biting our nails
So strong and frail
[Chorus:]
And we build and tear down
Build and tear down
Build and tear down
With barely the time to say
How did it get so late
I'll never know
Step outside and now the doors open wide
And the minions are eager to find him
Put a million miles under your heels
And you're still behind him
Cover your clocks with your chains and your locks
While the seasons get hotter and colder
Stretch your faces and lie about your ages
And still you're going to get older
As we're chasing our tails
And biting our nails
So strong and frail
[Chorus]
I'll never know
Hang on till your fingers break
And your hands unwind
He will escape you every time
From under your pillows
Through open windows
And out on the rails
[Chorus]
I'll never know
I'll never know<start>From inside his mouth I licked the blood
While he is roaring and biting I wash off the mud
Cause the tempest is out to wrestle the wild
Stop charging my darling, come closer be quiet
Cause where you see a wall, I see a door
Set up with no map, and turn off your torch
Where you see a wall, I see a door
You'll get through, you'll be home
You'll be home
From inside his mouth I lick the scars
The woodland believes, marking a path
And if you just rest your head stop repeating the charge
You'll know that this time I'll turn all the locks
Cause where you see a wall, I see a door
Set up with no map, and turn off your torch
Cause where you see a wall, I see a door
You'll get through, you'll be home
You'll be home
Just sit still. Does it hurt?
Does it hurt?
Just sit still. Does it hurt?
Does it hurt?
Just sit still. Does it hurt?
Does it hurt?
Just sit still. Does it hurt?
Does it hurt?<start>The surgeon general, doctor koop
S'posed to give you all the poop
But when he's with p.m.r.c.
The poop he's scoopin'
Amazes me
C-span showed him, all dressed up
In his phoney doctor God get-up
He looked in the camera and fixed his specs
'n gave a little lecture
'bout anal sex
He says it is not good for us
We just can't be promiscuous
He's a docter -- he should know
It's the work of the devil, so
Girls, don't blow!
Don't blow jimmy, don't blow bobby
Get yourself another hobby
(if jesus practiced medicine
I'm sure he'd do it
Just like him)
Is doctor koop a man to trust?
It seems at least that reagan must
(but ron's a trusting sort of guy --
He trusts ed meese
I wonder why? )
The a.m.a. has just got caught
For doin' stuff it shouldn't ought
All they do is lie and lie
Where's doctor koop?
He's standin' by
Surgeon general? what's the deal?
Is your epidemic real?
Are you leaving something out?
Something we can't talk about?
A little green monkey over there
Kills a million people?
That's not fair!
Did it really go that way?
Did you ask the c.i.a.?
Would they take you serious,
Or have they been
Promiscuous<start>You come in cold
You're covered in blood
They're all so happy you've arrived
The doctor cuts your cord,
Hands you to your mom
She sets you free into this life
And where do you go
With no destination
No map to guide you
Wouldn't you know
That it doesn't matter we all end up the same
[Chorus]
These are the chronicles of life and death and everything between
These were the stories of our lives, as fictional as they may seem.
You come in this world, and you go out just the same.
Today could be the best day of your life.
And money talks in this world,
That's what idiots will say
But you'll find out that this world,
Is just an idiots parade
Before you go, you've got some questions.
And you want answers
But now you're old, cold, covered in blood,
Right back to where you started from
[Chorus]<start>Cheap china shoes
Tight on my feet
All man-made fabric
Worn out and beat
Pacing the floor
Walking the street
You fly over Brooklyn
Back in a week
I left a note on the back page of your book
Volumes away but it's worth a good look
Remember me, remember that you're mine
Remember me when you get to the last line
Love in the head
Taking beach on a bike
All paper players going on strike
I left a note on the back page of your book
Volumes away but it's worth a good look
Remember me, remember that you're mine
Remember me when you get to the last line
I'm flat on my back
I'm allergic to love
My rate of recovery is not fast enough
With time on my hands I'm waiting to hear
Our last night in Chelsea
Where it seems like years
I left a note on the back page of your book
Volumes away but it's worth the good look
Remember me, remember that you're mine
Remember me when you get to the last line<start>Spinning in space
Been that way since the first tear
Rolled down Adam's face
Man we get beat up
Time's taken more than its toll
When times get this hard girl
It's hard to take hold
I don't want to give up
[Chorus ]
Baby, hold on to me girl
I'll hold on to you
Faith, hope and love's what it takes to get through
In this pretty blue world
It's a pretty blue world
Waking up to a struggle
I don't want to face
Ain't got a choice
Now we're stuck in this place
Is anybody up there
Sometimes it's hard to believe
Think our prayers have been answered
We've got what we need
When you want to give up
[Chorus ]
Ain't much that's certain
Between the curtains
But as long as this world continues to spin
no matter how blue, baby
This much is true, baby
Faith hope and love
Baby
Hold on to me girl
When it gets cold
Do I have your love
That's all I need to know
In this pretty blue world
It's a pretty blue world<start>Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write "I love you"
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Crowded street, busy feet hustle by him
Downtown shoppers, Christmas is nigh
There he sits all alone on the sidewalk
He's just hoping he won't pass him by
Should I stop? Better not, much too busy
I'm in a hurry, my how time does fly
And in the distance the ringing of laughter
And in the midst of the laughter he cries
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write "I love you"
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue<start>Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man ev'ry night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of pane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
If you come down to the river
Bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry 'cause you have [if you got] no money
People on the river are happy to give
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river<start>The sun broke the haze
For the 1st time in days
I'm feelin' no pain
I suppose its old news
Like a boy with a bruise
A little girl with no shoes
Nobody knows how loneliness grows
I don't care if it shows
You'll get
Over you, over me
The rain fills the creek
For the first time in weeks
I'm getting' some sleep
I suppose its good news
But it's a hard thing to lose
There's no choice but to choose
Nobody knows
Where happiness goes
Like a river it flows
I'll get
Over me
You'll get
Over you over me
But it's a hard thing to see
That you left me here to bleed
As the years roll by
It's gets harder to find
The answer to the question why
I'm leaving today
Gonna make my own
I don't care what they say
I suppose this is real
Like the pain that you feel
Well you'll just have to deal
Nobody knows
Why friends and the foes
I don't care if she knows
You'll get
Over you
I'll get
Over me
You'll get over you, over me
Over me, over me, over me, over me
Over me<start>One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
We're gonna find out
Pretty mama
What turns on your lights
The full moon is calling
The fever is high
And the wicked wind whispers
And moans
You got your demons
You got desires
Well, I got a few of my own
Oo, someone to be kind to in
Between the dark and the light
Oo, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
One of these nights
One of these dreams
One of these lost and lonely dreams
We're gonna find one
One that really screams
I've been searching for the daughter
Of the devil himself
I've been searching for an angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little
Of both
And I can feel her but she's nowhere
In sight
Oo, loneliness will blind you
In between the wrong and the right
Oo, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
One of these nights
One of these nights
In between the dark and the light
Coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
Get 'ya baby one of these nights
One of these nights
One of these nights
I can feel it
I can feel it
One of these nights
Coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you now
One of these nights..etc....<start>Well, I've got to run to keep from hiding,
And I'm bound to keep on riding.
And I've got one more silver dollar,
But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no,
Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider.
And I don't own the clothes I'm wearing,
And the road goes on forever,
And I've got one more silver dollar,
But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider.
And I've gone by the point of caring,
Some old bed I'll soon be sharing,
And I've got one more silver dollar,
(Repeat three times and Fade)
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let them catch the Midnight Rider.<start>Somebody brought the juicer
I thought I'd take a sip
Came off the rails so crazy
My senses took a dip
Before the bottle hit the floor
And I'd had time to think
I was blinded by desire
The elephant turned pink
The rest is simply shady
It's all been done before
But it doesn't make life easy
That's for sure
You may think about a lady
Cause yourself a minor war
And your life won't be so easy anymore
No sooner had I sown it
When I began to reap
I was torn from shallow water
And plunged into the deep
And as I started drowning
I clung onto a straw
That somehow kept me floating
While my madness craved for more
The rest is simply shady
It's all been done and more
But it doesn't make life simple
That's for sure
You may think about a lady
Let her in through your front door
And your life won't be so easy anymore
A pebble in the ocean
Must cause some kind of stir
And witnessed by the silence
Will reach from here to there
The action that I've started
Sometime I'll have to face
My influence in motion
Rebounding back through space
The rest is simply shady
It's all been done before
But it doesn't make life easy
That's for sure
You may think of sexy sadie
Let her in through your front door
And your life won't be so easy anymore
Cause yourself a minor war
And your life won't be so easy anymore
You may think of sexy sadie
Let her in through your front door
But your life won't be so easy anymore<start>I guess it wasn't as bad as it sounds.
We wore the embers like a crown,
as a reminder to remember
things don't heat up until the sun goes down.
From between the heat of passing cars,
well things got ugly from the start.
We saved some money from some crimes
and use it all to tattoo the scars.
Let the story dilate
Mike stayed forty miles away,
things weren't getting any better at his place.
Over bail bonds and broken pores,
with solemn hearts and solid boards.
Traversed the stairs to fade the memories,
closed it up and locked the doors.
So close but still haloed to crash the calm
It's only one night so what's the harm?
This apartment is no more haven than home.
Let's flood the floors,
come tomorrow we'll all be gone.
I always dreamed but never would've thought
that five of us sifting through the ash
would be the end result of too great a cost.
We placed the call to Nashville to him
Cincinnati burned us down.
The more I say these things out loud,
the more the words just twist around.
So slowly find it strange
young men with principles have a way of accumulating debts with ages.
Replace the fiction while the story ignites the scene.
We're thinking it's too much to ask for
while the flames ignite the dream.
We're sinking and they're beginning to jettison the hopeful.
I fear it's what I hoped for.
I willed it and if so
it's from real
And it's my ship to sink with.
It could be the drain of summer heat,
Fourth of July or enemies.
Bad wiring, bad timing.
It could be the weight of gravity.
It could be a story that no one will ever believe.
It could be a million things but please,
right now we only need a place to sleep.
So close but still haloed to crash the calm.
It's only one night so what's the harm.
Come sunrise those drinks won't keep you warm.
It's up to you I could be here I could be gone
things don't heat up until the sun goes down.<start>I don't mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless
When my cup's already overfilled
Yeah
But it's on the table
The fire is cooking
And their farming babies
While the slaves are working
The blood is on the table
And their mouths are choking
But I'm growing hungry
Yeah
I don't mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless
When my cup's already overfilled
Oho, ah

While the slaves are working

It's a freak show for Mother Nature

It don't subscribe to his point of view
(I can see you)
Some time is lost in clouds in her minds and so
I can see it too
(I can see you)
Pope John Paul's had a fall, they won't take no anymore
They're bored with the dinosaur icon
If the city is fear, then build a bridge outta here
But you've no hooks to hang from

He's staring, pays a bill from his pew
It don't subscribe to his point of view

Passing daze, you feel collection intent
You got no vision
(I'll see if I can)
You've got vision
(Be sure like her)
You got hurt
(I'll see if I can heal you)
Take a little while, before you speak out
Read between my lines and and know there is
There must be something good in a tumbled up world
In a shook up world
And if you're one of the boys, with your irrelevant ploys
You're too close for comfort
Well it might keep you amused, to leave the restless confused
You'll have so much more to run from

Is he coming closer
Well I'll just make believe
That I've never been afraid
Crackle, Crackle,
You're all dead
Feel the heat from firehead
From spooky stories that he's read
They put pictures on his body
Living out a fantasy
To be the last one left alive, hah!
Crackle, Crackle,
You're all dead
Feel the heat from firehead
He's lost the instruction
No control
Suicide fever, he won't be much older
I know, won't go, away
What's that smoke that I can see
Rising from the ashes
Well, it seems that there will always be
Someone just like you
Crackle, Crackle,
And you're all dead
Feel the heat from firehead, firehead, firehead!<start>Stars go down in the western sky
The light fades in as the darkness dies
Sunlight, sweet sunlight brings the day that You've created
Perfect remedy for all that tears at me
Arise, arise with the morning
Arise, Your mercies are new
Arise, arise with the morning
That finds me running back to You
Darkness comes and covers all my faults
Tears fall down and sting my wounds like salt
Hopes fade till I'm caught in the day that You've created
Perfect remedy for all that tears at me
Arise, arise with the morning
Arise, Your mercies are new
Arise, arise with the morning
That finds me running back to You
I'm anxiously waiting
Redemption is brimming with the stories created
Each new day I know You are coming
Arise, arise with the morning
Arise, Your mercies are new
Arise, arise with the morning
That finds me running back to You
I'm running back to You<start>Es beginnt in der Nacht

They're turning over the stones
But there's nothing here to be found
Looking to the desert in a cool moonlight
Nobody watching, there is no one out tonight
Standing in the shadows there's a real mean guy
And I don't know if I'll make it
And I don't know if I'm gonna die tonight

Smoke the hookah pipes

Fighting for your life

I wish I'd never listened
To that old high priest
He told me of the riches
They buried beneath
Down in the crypt where the men fear to tread
She danced the seven veils and the boy was nearly dead

Fighting for your life

Around each corner, right back where I started
Deep inside my mind, it seems
I try to find an open door to go through
So they can see that I'm all right
Wanderin' 'round inside without a key
Watching with these open eyes
Locked inside the place that no one sees
Talking to eternity, trying to explain
Why I'm stuck inside the maze
All the corners look the same
Thought I'd finally find the way
But I'm right back where I started
Now I'm stuck inside the maze
All the corners look the same
Thought I'd finally find the way
Another door, an empty room
No one seems to have been here for some time
Where have they gone?
Endless world of corridors
Searching for the one that shows the way
They look the same that I remain
Wanderin' 'round inside without a key
Watching through these open eyes
Locked inside the place that no one sees
Talking to eternity, trying to explain
Why I'm stuck inside the maze

From the east to the west, from here to Bombay
Save the whales, save the planet
Save the eagles today
From the mountains to the valleys
To the rich and the poor
Everybody has a voice but they still want more
They fight, they shout, they yell what they screamin' for
Picket lines, burning flags magazines
Coup-de-ta, kill the king
See the people rally, hear them scream
The world's a speaker, listen to them sing
It's an audio world
A world that's speaking out to you
It's an audio world
A world that's dying to hear the truth
You got to show up, speak up, get the word told
Tell all the people and you've got to be bold
Just let the voice of God in their hearts unfold
We make the message known by the anthems we sing
But there's many of us who haven't done a thing
Be a sign waver for the Christ and the coming king
Let's preach and teach and spread the word
Tell everybody 'til everybody's heard
Let it be known that it's for the king
And this is the reason that we sing

Lyricals on the women
I always seem to end up the victim of some terrible ass-kicking
So now I'm telling myself
"Friend, why you got the obsession?"
Here it is now, people to the best of my recollection
It goes against my catholic upbringing
I admit it, I'm a sucker for the witch
Sucker for the witch
I can tell you precisely
Where this all began
Salem, Massachusetts and I was hardly a man
I fell madly in love with
Some brand of Stevie Nicks
Oh, I begged and I pleaded like a fiend for a fix
I must unburden my guilty conscience
I admit it, I'm a sucker for the witch
May God have mercy on my wicked soul
I can't help myself I'm a sucker for the witch
I might deny her but my heart will never resist
I can't help myself, I'm a sucker
She's made her appearances
In many the rhyme
And that's my cross to bear
Until the end of time
Better call the inquisition
Better put me to the test
Give me exorcism
For I am truly possessed
It goes against my catholic upbringing
I admit it, I'm a sucker for the witch
Sucker for the witch
I must unburden my guilty conscience
I admit it, I'm a sucker for the witch
May God have mercy on my wicked soul
I can't help myself, I'm a sucker for the witch
I might deny her but my heart will never resist
I can't help myself, I'm a sucker
For the witch
It goes against my catholic upbringing
I admit it, I'm a sucker for the witch
May God have mercy on my wicked soul
I can't help myself, I'm a sucker for the witch
I might deny her but my heart will never resist
I can't help myself, I'm a sucker<start>Well it's high time you realize
That I must live my life as it surrounds me
I can give you all the room you
Need to be yourself as I am
In the same key
We can live our lives together, yes, and still remain
Ourselves if we believe
And I believe, oh, oh darlin'.
[Chorus]
Got to keep and open heart, got to keep an open mind.
Got to keep workin' hard or you get left behind
Got to keep lovin', got to keep givin'.
Got to let nothin' get in the way of livin'.
Gotta keep open.
I've given you my heart, I give my soul
I give you everything I have
Yes, and just as there's a special part of you
That's yours alone
To keep, I'm glad there is so much we can do together
And I believe, oh, oh darlin'.
[Chorus]
I was looking for love, I was losing my mind.
I was searching for someone to care.
I was fighting my feelings to turn and to run.
And I looked in your heart.
And I saw there was somebody there.
So I'm sitting on the river in your city
And I'm writing out these words
And I hope that you will listen to my song
Cause it is mine and now it's yours
I'm the master of my fate and the captain of my soul
And I believe
Yes, I believe, oh, oh darlin'.
[Chorus]<start>Are you for real?
Are you yessing me to Death?
You get my humor
And baby, I'm amazed
Yeah, this must be my day
You're too good lookin'
There must be something wrong
I'm sure you're taken
I'm doing it again
But I don't want to screw myself
[Chorus]
'Cause you're a little bit too nice
I look a little bit like hell
'Cause I'm a little overtired
And I'm a little overwhelmed
And you're a little bit too late
And it's a little bit too soon
And I'm a little bit too strange
For somebody like you
Walk Over Me
So far, So good
You proved me wrong again
But I'm not certain
So can we fill the space
With this awkward silence?
[Chorus]
Walk Over Me
[Chorus]
Oh, it feels a little bit too right
So I know it must be wrong
I wanna take you home tonight
But I'm trying to be strong
Oh, you know a little bit too much
And it's a little bit too fast
I don't have the best of luck
With making these things last
Oh, I'm just a little like my mom
I barely get a wink of sleep
And I will never lie to you
And your secrets I will keep
Oh, and you're a little bit like me
Think you're a little bit too smart
I'm a little bit weary
So please don't break my heart
Walk Over Me
Walk Over Me
Walk Over Me<start>Since you've been gone
I haven't done anything at all
I feel so alone
I drove onto another dead end road
Since you've been gone
I haven't done anything at all
I feel so alone
I drove onto another dead end road
Everything is boring, I feel worthless
Hidden by our everyday passion
Since you've been gone
the world has changed, one's happiness brings pain
It's all said and done
I feel the same even when I'm far away
Since you've been gone
the world has changed, one's happiness brings pain
It's all said and done
I feel the same even when I'm far away
Are you being strong?
Have you done anything at all?
Do you feel alone?
I wanna drive away on a better road
Everyday is slow and I feel useless
I feel I'll never find that same affection
Since you've been gone
the world has changed, one's happiness brings pain
It's all said and done
I feel the same even when I'm far away
Since you've been gone
the world has changed, one's happiness brings pain
It's all said and done
I feel the same even when I'm far away
I know you said it's better for us
no I think I've suffered long enough
I try to live my life without you for one more day
One more day
(Guitar solo)
Since you've been gone
the world has changed, one's happiness brings pain
It's all said and done
I feel the same even when I'm far away
Since you've been gone
the world has changed, one's happiness brings pain
It's all said and done
I feel the same even when I'm far away<start>Open your ears and up a seat for the tale of the ballydowse.
just what they are might well be you when
the tell reaches your house
between way past plenty and a need no one should know
they were born and raised unsettled
within sight of high and low
equal blessings, hardhsips, toes, and
fingers, opened eyes returned and lingered
to the ones who got picked last
to the dancers never asked
to the darkened half of the heart of man
that leaves his brother trapped
underbred and under way we are leaping to
the fray throwing for the lovely underdogs
underbrush and underbelly flags flying
willy-nilly we'll undermine the greedy and the cruel.
come along all are welcome let
man's barriers be broken, from silver
spoons to empty pockets all
raise your glass and raise your voices ain't
against then be for us
no paradise we'll reap but we'll go down
plowing just the same
so you sat and heard the tell, if you're
leaving just as well
too many living on the fences as it is
but if your heart volunteers to the crying
and the cheers
let the dead bury the dead and come along
equal blessing, hardships, crying, and singing
you'll get back just like you're giving
to the ones who got picked last
to the dancers never asked
if you got ears then hear if you don't forget we asked<start>With these arms I'll hold you
Let my love enfold you
Please don't cry
Night and day forever
Rain, sea, surf, sand, clouds then sun will shine
Born in the spirit of love
You took flight
Soaring so high and so free
No-one can stop you
You'll always be heard
Our hearts know the truth
In pools of blue I found you
Let my love surround you
Gave you life
From that day forever
Rain, sea, surf, sand, clouds then sun will shine
Born in the spirit of love
You took flight
Soaring so high and so free
No-one can stop you
You'll always be heard
Our hearts know the truth
Born in the spirit of love
You took flight
Soaring so high and so free
No-one can stop you
You'll always be heard
They'll never kill the mockingbird
She'll fly free<start>Suddenly now
I'm beginning to see clear
Well I'm free again
Making me feel all right
Look at me now
No more going through changes
Cause a little outrageous
Right there in the night
[Chorus:]
Sooner or later,
You got to let down your shield
Sooner or later, yeah
We all fly home
Well we all fly home
And when on a cold black night
Gives up a fight
We all fly home
Well where will you turn
When you're tired of running
Will you hear me calling,
Telling you which way to go
Don't pretend that you
Don't feel the danger
Cause it's the only stranger
Out there in the cold
[Chorus x2]<start>No one can blame you for walking away
Too much rejection
No love injection
Life can be easy
It's not always swell
Don't tell me truth hurts, little girl
'Cause it hurts like hell
But down in the underground
You'll find someone true
Down in the underground
A land serene
A crystal moon, ah, ah
It's only forever
Not long at all
Lost and lonely
That's underground
Underground
Daddy, daddy, get me out of here
Ha ha, I'm underground
Heard about a place today
Nothing never hurts again
Daddy, daddy, get me out of here
Ah ha I'm underground
Sister sister, please take me down
Ah ah I'm underground
Daddy, daddy, get me out of here
No one can blame you for walking away
Too much rejection
No love injection
But down in the underground
You'll find someone true
Down in the underground
A land serene
A crystal moon, ah, ah
It's only
It's only forever
It's not long at all
The lost and the lonely
That's underground
Underground
Daddy, daddy, get me out of here
Heard about a place today
Nothing never hurts again
Daddy, daddy, get me out of here
Ha ha, I'm underground
Sister, sister, please take me down
Ah ha I'm underground

Wanna live underground

But this dark sky will soon be blue
Don't ask, no don't ask
Just watch as the grey mists of winter fall
Like so many drops of dew
Feel the ice melt to warm tears in my eyes
Uner the light of a tin sun
Do not ask me how I know
The effect of light on unseeing eyes
How should I know?
How could I know?
Dark now my sky
The sea of peace has left my shore
No birds sing
The silent spring will overflow
Oh you'll never know
I love you so
You'll always be
A part of me
Dark now my eyes
The sea of peace has met the sky
No birds sing
And like the Spring life whispers by
Oh you'll never know
I love you so
You'll always be
A part of me
Dark now my sky
The winds of time have swept my shore
No birds fly
The trees that fall will rise no more
Oh you'll never know
I love you so
You'll always be
A part of me<start>Now you see it, see it everywhere
All around the world they're giving it all away
So many faces slaving for someone
If you hate your job then you're giving it all away
And television feeds an empty mind
40 channels but what have we got?
Seeing adventures can be so unkind
When it seems like you never took your shot
And you were gonna write your own ticket ....
A&r; man says he'll make us rick
Promises of giving so much away
Well promises are easy to find
Like selling umbrellas on a rainy day
"but what's a value here or there my friend?
Values won't keep you warm in the end
Independence is all very nice
But bed and breakfast always comes with a price"
And you were gonna write your own ticket ....
But those tickets aren't so easy to come by
See that man? He's working hard for it
Hates it, lonely -- he's giving it all away
Got a bright new car and he's staying late for it
Cause if he don't they'll take it all away
See that girl? You'd do anything for her
She's all get no give, and still you stay
And you were gonna write your own ticket ....<start>Bad blood, rivers run dry
Thunder comes and the Children cry bad blood
never can change, no one here to blame
bad blood, older than time
followed me down from my fathers tribe
bad blood, making me shake
Running through my veins, bad blood
Too many questions, so many unanswered times
Most times the finger points at me
In my confusion, might slip and cross the line
I'm not to blame for all you see
you can't help me it's in my soul
pray for mercy, nowhere else to go
REPEAT CHORUS :
In my confession, I swear and cross my heart
I stand before you what I am
gunpowder ready, just waiting for a spark
and those before me understand
please protect me, keep me safe
heaven help me, save me from this fate
REPEAT CHORUS :
Swimming hard and fast
against the time
lost in a flood
of ancient fire
REPEAT CHORUS :<start>Ooh oh oh oh, ooh oh oh oh
Be careful making wishes in the dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the meantime I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out of the cage
I'm a young lovers rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light em up up up, light em up up up,
light em up up up, I'm on fire
So light em up up up, light em up up up,
light em up up up, I'm on fire
Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)
Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)
All the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just dies
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love
Then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides
My childhood spat back the monster that you see
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light em up up up, light em up up up,
light em up up up, I'm on fire
So light em up up up, light em up up up,
light em up up up, I'm on fire
Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)
Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)
My songs know what you did in the dark
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light em up up up, light em up up up,
light em up up up, I'm on fire
So light em up up up, light em up up up,
light em up up up, I'm on fire

Is a profound mystery
Looking back, you know you had to bring me through
All that I was so afraid of
Though I questioned the sky, now I see why
Had to walk the rocks to see the mountain view
Looking back, I see the lead of love
Looking back, I can finally see
How failures bring humility
It brings me to my knees
Helps me see my need for thee
Looking back you know you had to bring me through
All that I was so afraid of
And though I questioned the sky, now I see why
Had to walk the rocks to see the mountain view
Looking back, I see the lead of love
I had to walk the rocks to see the mountain view
Looking back, I see the lead of love
I see the lead of love<start>Another time, another place for you and me
Is that the way it has to be?
I can see it in your eyes, I can feel it inside
This is real, now we're right back where we started
Stolen hours are all we ever know
It's so hard to let you go
And in the air that I breathe there's a chill when you leave
Don'tcha know one day will be forever
I don't care what's wrong or right
I only know you are mine tonite
And for a while we can hold on tight
That's all I know, you are mine tonite
Simple answers we may never find
Tell your heart to give it time
Now there's a road if we dare, no one said love was fair
But one day, one day we'll be together
I don't care what's wrong or right
I only know you are mine tonite
And for a while we can hold on tight
That's all I know, you are mine tonite
Oh oh, am I lost in this dream, I can't escape?
Oh oh, there must be some way outta here
But to live without you would be more than I can take<start>Michael mcdonald
So you tell him to say no more
You don't want to know why or where
Where he's been all these lonely nights
You know what's wrong and don't care what's right
As long as he comes back to you
Someone to love him all his life
It ain't nothin' but a heartache
Darling, you'll get over it
It ain't nothing but a heartache
Darling, you'll get over it
There's always there comes a day
When love just goes away
When there's no caring, no words to say
There's no forgiving, no games to play
When all you know will get you through
Seems like you've known it all your life<start>she turns water into wine

Does it make em' feel happy, won't it cause any tears
Want to sit here in my room and do nothing at all
No I don't want to answer to society's call
I want to be a kid forever, no responsibilities
I want to be a kid forever, aged 10 when I freeze
Seeing couples on the streets walking kindly hang in hand
Happily married, this I can't understand
Rather be all alone on an island far away
Never think about tomorrow, I'm just gonna seize the day
Don't wanna undestand the world, there's way too much hate
Don't wanna go to school to learn, they'll decide your fate

If you listen to them
The gap will grow
If we just close our eyes we might wake up alone
You know I'd be a fool
To be messing around
'Cause no one comes close to you or close to what we've found
'Cause everything that you see isn't what it seems
She might have got lucky but not with me

Do your eyes grow dim
Do the walls come down

Nothing like a vivid dream
To take you back again
When you think of me
Do your eyes grow dim
Do the walls come down
When you think of me
Do you let me in
Do the walls come down
Something in my pocket

In faded ink said "You are my fire"
Do you think so
Do the walls come down
When you think of me
Do your eyes grow dim
Do the walls come down
When you think of me
Do you let me in

You never loved me anyway

Something sudden movement

I know what we want
Weird little moments
Do or don't
So many highs for her
Know what she needs
Lightning in my movement
We compete

Our day off to Hanover
Beat up car with young girl driving
Slow down and pull over
In the rear view mirror
Like co-conspirators we did smile
I did not know that I was running
I saw the sunlight streaming
Down on the landscape
Of my Alcatraz escape
From the sadness 'twas born in my soul
Three years passed, still I was suffering
Spent that March in Charlottesville
Saw the ghost of Thomas Jefferson
Sitting on my window sill
With his thin powdered hair
And his concubine there he did smile
I did not know that I was running
I saw the twilight gleaming
Down on the landscape
Of my Alcatraz escape
From the sadness 'twas born in my soul
I went down through the labyrinth
Of my falsified regret
Deep in flight from the light in my soul
Oh what a complicated tapestry I sewed
All that energy I wasted on my fear
All those years spent stumbling down that lonesome road
It's not very clear
How far or how near I have come
I did not know that I was running
I see the sunlight streaming
Down on the landscape....<start>Well she got her daddy's car
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now
Seems she forgot all about the library

And with the radio blasting
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now

'Til her daddy takes the T-Bird away
(Fun fun fun 'til her daddy takes the T-Bird away)
Well the girls can't stand her
'Cause she walks looks and drives like an ace now
(You walk like an ace now you walk like an ace)
She makes the Indy 500 look like a Roman chariot race now
(You look like an ace now you look like an ace)
A lotta guys try to catch her
But she leads them on a wild goose chase now
(You drive like an ace now you drive like an ace)
And she'll have fun fun fun
'Til her daddy takes the T-Bird away

Well you knew all along

And since he took your set of keys
You've been thinking that your fun is all through now

But you can come along with me
'Cause we gotta a lot of things to do now

That sharin' love never hurt no one.
many never get to see it's outcome.
Because sharin' love is never done.
So many problems would disappear.
If we help instead of passin' by.
Sacrifices come from sharin' love,
As lovin' us caused Christ to die.
Sharin' love has never hurt no one.
And It's such an easy thing to do.
Sharin' love has never hurt no one.
Love is God's greatest gift to you.
Compassion, helpin', and showin' care.
Always saves a soul of one who shares.<start>Crawled back into bed, pretending to sleep
Clammy in my jammies, dress is hurting its keep

Can you outshoot the Devil? Outrun his hounds?

Shot another one down

Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine

Where do we go from here
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feeling this)
Our breathing has got too loud (I'm feeling this)
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feeling this)
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feeling this)
We're taking this way too slow (I'm feeling this)
Take me away from here (I'm feeling this)

Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
This place was never the same again
After you came and went
How can you say you meant anything different
To anyone standing alone
On the street with a cigarette
On the first night we met
Look to the past
And remember her smile
And maybe tonight
I can breathe for awhile
I'm not in the seat
I think I'm fallin' asleep
But then all that it means is
I'll always be dreaming of you
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine

Shattered down below, she can take it yet remains the sane.
Come again sweet delight, roam again weep within
Sorrow left me cold, you bring me away from the shame

Met the shadow which I thought could be my own
Once again I trusted in someone else.
Saw a flash before the bullet
Met the shadow which I thought could be my own
Once again I trusted in someone else.
Return my inner fire, rewoken warmth of undivine
So these separated times gave me embrace till we died
Without my tense desire I could not even try
Have I been deranged, it never felt this real.
Saw a flash before the bullet
Met the shadow which I thought could be my own
Once again I trusted in someone else.
Saw a flash before the bullet
Met the shadow which I thought could be my own
Once again I trusted in someone else.
I will not give in to someone inside me
Saw a flash before the bullet
Met the shadow which I thought could be my own
Once again I trusted in someone else.

An' I never got the chance
To settle down an' get a hold on love
Takin' air an' movin' around
Is all I can see that I'm doin'
An' it is bringin' me down
Drivin' on a highway going nowhere
Desolation destination
Guess I'll find it somewhere
I know if there's trouble
I ain't takin' the blame
That's why I keep movin'
So nobody knows my name
Born a loser
I'm beyond the law
Women behind me
Never can find me
They can never get together
What I've been here for
'cause I'm a drifter
Rollin' on
Ain't wastin' my time no more<start>The one life to live so I'ma live it
The one chance to give so I'ma give it
All that I have with no limit
We made it this far but it's only the beginning
Got my eyes set strictly on the prizes
Standing in my own two shoes my whole life is
Easier said than done but I survive it
Aim for the stars, dream big and don't hide it
I got my head up in the clouds now
I'm so high I'm never coming down
I like living up here, watching life from the sky
Everything becomes clear
And as the mist rises I can see horizons
A new day has dawned I'm just happy to be alive
I'ma make it to the top and if not I die trying
If I'm lying watch my nose grow, Barbara Streisand
I got my head up in the clouds now
I'm so high I'm never coming down
I like living up here watching life from the sky
Everything becomes clear
When life is boring
Write your own story
In skies you're soaring
When life is surreal
Put on your disguise
And just live in the sky
Put on your disguise
And just live in the sky
I've seen things I just can't explain
I've seen the fire and I've seen the rain
I've been places and ask questions
But was told that my answers were blowing in the wind
So now I follow the purple haze
All the way through the everglades
I've broken through to the other side
Just to find myself building castles in the sky
Never rise up, I can see reality below me
Floating on a dream to the house of the holy
Hands clinch tight praying death come slowly
'Cause life's too short to give up what you're holding
I got my head up in the clouds now
I'm so high I'm never coming down
I like living up here, watching life from the sky
Everything becomes clear
When life is boring
Write your own story
In skies you're soaring
When life is surreal
Put on your disguise
And just live in the sky
Put on your disguise
And just live in the sky
When life is boring
Write your own story
In skies you're soaring
When life is surreal
Put on your disguise
And just live in the sky

It was nothing illegal just a little bit funny
He said "c'mon don't tell me that the rich don't know
Sooner or later it all comes down to money"

When you love her and she doesn't love you
You're only learning the game
When she says that you're the only one she'll ever love
Then you find that you are not the one she's thinking of
Feeling so sad and you're all alone and blue
That's when you're learning the game<start>Now it's complete,
Ravel is in the rain
Standing in my dream street.
I'd like to meet
Ravel in New Orleans,
Hold out my hand to his.
I was warned, now I'm old,
Still searching for what I'm told
Is gone, is God, is not.
Don't try to leave,
I've tried so many times.
The street is named desire.

I was warned, now I'm old
Still searching for what I'm told
Is gone, is God, is not.

That feels so strange to say
How does eighteen years ago
Seem just like yesterday
A hundred kids from around the world
On a ship to the great unknown
Two boys for every girl
You had never been away from home
You were drinking something really green
Hopping around like a grasshopper
I was sipping diesel gasoline
Then I threw up on the mezzanine
I wonder if it ever crosses your mind
'Cause I'm afraid its something I dwell on all of the time
I hear your doing amazing, and
Believe me that makes me smile
But I hope you think of me every once in a while
We watched the stars shine
Ate chicken by the slot machines
I was with a friend of mine
He got into your roommate's jeans
We danced to Aerosmith
And then we watched the sun appear
I took a bracelet from your wrist
You took an earring from my ear
You twisted one last twirl
Then kissed me so fuckin' hard
And all at once our friends would leave
Our hair tangled in the ocean breeze
You told me you loved me
I asked you if you were sure
You said you thought so
And then I said that I loved you too
I wonder if it ever crosses your mind
'Cause I'm afraid its something I dwell on all of the time
I hear your doing amazing, and
Believe me that makes me smile
But I hope you think of me every once in a while
Georgia girl meets Texas boy
Place in time so far away
Like Leonardo DiCaprio
But our ship sank a different way
A lifetime in four short days
Said goodbye and we never looked back
A few letters always ended the same
I love you, did you know that?
I wonder if it ever crosses your mind
'Cause I'm afraid its something I dwell on all of the time
I hear your doing amazing, and
Believe me that makes me smile
But I hope you think of me every once in a while
Yeah I hope you think of me every once in a while<start>Four o'clock, I've been walkin' all night. It's the time I always think of you. If you could only see through my eyes, Then you'd know just what I'm goin' through. Here am I, I'm taking a chance, In running around with stars in my eyes. Here I am, I'm looking for you, Wondering why do I feel so blue. I'm dreamin', dreamin' of me and you. Oh I'm dreamin', dreamin' will see me through. Never let any chances pass me by, I'm gonna dream you right into my life. Yeah, dream you right into my life. Dreamin', dreamin' will see me through. Woman, you'd better believe that I'm dreamin' you into my life. Five o'clock, still walkin' around. I call you up, but you just bring me down. I guess you'd say I'm getting nowhere. But in my dreams you always come around. Here am I, I'm taking a chance, I'm walkin' on air, flyin' so high. Here am I, facin' the truth, There's no other way, I'll ever make you mine. I'm dreamin', dreamin' of me and you. Oh I'm dreamin', dreamin' will see me through. Never let any chances pass me by, I'm gonna dream you right into my life. Yeah, dream you right into my life. Dreamin', dreamin' will see me through. Woman, you'd better believe that I'll be dreamin' you into my life. Woman, you've got to believe me, woman. Oh, woman, you've got to believe me, woman. I'll be dreamin' you into my life. You've got to believe me, woman. Woman, oh woman, you got to believe me. I'll be forever dreamin' you into my life. Ã¡<start>Waking light, it grew from the shadow
Brace yourself to the morning low
Night is gone, long way turning
You've waited long enough to know
When the memory leaves you
Somewhere you can't make it home
When the morning comes to meet you
Lay me down in waking light
No one sees you here, roots are all covered
There's such a life to go and how much can you show?
Day is gone on a landslide of rhythm
It's in your lamplight burning low
When the memory leaves you
Somewhere you can't make it home
When the morning comes to meet you
Rest your eyes in waking light<start>When your heart is beating black and blue
And a cold world's looking back at you
When you're fading low around the bend
Go on turn around you'll see me
I will always be your friend
Set your heart free
Set your heart free...
Said you can't say much about today
Just that dark cloud coming back your way
And that your dreams are all worn thin
Well, you better stop with all that talk
Before it all starts happening
Set your heart free...
Listen to your heart...
When your heart is beating black and blue
And the old world's knocking down on you
And you're starting to become unglued
Don't go there, come on, you know i love you
Set your heart free...<start>You can tell a changin' heart
Two faces smile and yet there is no joy
They look for wealth no matter what the cost
To someone else that they might just destroy
So many people gather round
A thousand voices lift their praise
For you have reached the top
And so begin you've only got
But when you're singing from the soul
They fail to see your final goal
They only tell you that you haven't
All ways left to go
So you rhyme the changin' line
With one wheel spinning and one on the ground
Then falling victim to the game of time
You place your name out in the lost and the found
So many people gather round
A thousand voices lift their praise
For you have reached the top
And so begin you've only got
But when you're singing from the soul
They fail to see your final goal
They only tell you that you haven't
All ways left to go

A new day is breakin'
It's been too long since I felt this way
I don't mind where I get taken
The road is callin'
Today is the day
I can see
It took so long to realize
I'm much too strong
Not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down
I'll turn it around
I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
Far away and left behind
It's a new horizon and I'm awakin' now
Oh I see myself in a brand new way
The sun is shinin'
The clouds are breakin'
Cause I can't lose now, there's no game to play
I can tell
There's no more time left to criticize
I've seen what I could not recognize
Everything in my life was leading me on
But I can be strong
I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
Far away and left behind<start>Now you know
I'm not a savior
Let me make it
Understood
And the shirt upon
My back is all i own
I don't wanna be
A loner
So i go against the grain
And i feel the blood
Is rushin' through my veins
I cant fake it
And i crucify myself
I have been shot down
By a stone
I'm gonna walk
Across the state line
Gotta take a
Higher road
I'm on the great divide
I'm sanctified
Be by your side
I hope we don't collide
So let me ride
The great divide
Its beautiful
I don't live in superstition
Gonna let my freak flag fly
Gotta black cat moan
My conscience is
My guide
And i use my intuition
There's a liar and a thief
And I've been to hell
Before you were my friend
I cant fake it
And i crucify myself
I have been shot down
By a stone
I'm gonna walk
Across the state line
Gotta take a
Higher road

Poor things. The struggle becoming a battle you've already lost to discover
Yourself, as a pillar a structure, but what have you got? To defend to repel
To begin the resistance that never has ended. We live in a world in a nation
That can't even fly it's own flag. We hang on to the past, with its
Brutality and division. Why cant you just make a decision? The future is
Yours. It's not theirs. It's not gods. It's not anyone's who presumes to own
You or the thoughts that make an original, shift all the subliminal brain
Massage from the rich man's poet who's bright lights will lure your weakness.
Just keep the guns locked out of reach of the Children. Keep the guns locked
Out of reach!
Can't you see you're breaking me
Can't you see you're faking me
Feel It
Can't You Feel It
Can't You Feel It
Can't You Feel That They've Failed You?
You're slowing the drugs in your veins are numbing every pain, every twinge,
Every singe from the fire of globalization, you're warming your hands on the
Bodies of children that learn so that MacDonald's can jack their yearly gross
Earnings if it wasn't real it would seem to absurd. The fear grows, the fuse
Blows on just one more bomb set by extremists that could have been me or
Been you. A push or a shove when a smile or some love would have helped out
That kid off his face on his dexies, his parents shove down his throat so
They don't have to divert their attention from making their quota or buying
That sofa that's just oh so comfy. As all the porn pours in vein the Nike
Channel, just keep your guns locked so very far out of reach!

Don't waste your breathe around me

First world problems<start>Such a feelin's comin' over me
There is wonder in most everything I see
Not a cloud in the sky
Got the sun in my eyes
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream.
Everything I want the world to be
Is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear
It's because you are here
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen.
I'm on the top of the world
Lookin' down on creation
And the only explanation that I can find
Is the love that I've found
Ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world.
Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's tellin' me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees
And the eouch of the breeze
There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me.
There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be
Just the same for you and me

E' la stessa cosa, che viva e morta,
che desta e dormiente, che giovane
e vecchia. Queste cose infatti,
ricadono nel mutamento in quelle,
e quelle viceversa in queste.
(Eraclito, Frammenti, 88)
Passano gli anni,
i treni, i topi per le fogne,
i pezzi in radio,
le illusioni, le cicogne.
Passa la giovent,
non te ne fare un vanto:
lo sai che tutto cambia,
nulla si pu fermare.
Cambiano i regni,
le stagioni, i presidenti, le religioni, gli urlettini
dei cantanti......
e intanto passa ignaro
il vero senso della vita.
Si cambia amore, idea, umore,
per noi che siamo solo di passaggio.
L'Informazione, il Coito, la Locomozione.
Diametrali Delimitazioni,
Settecentoventi Case.
Soffia la Verit
nel Libro della Formazione.
Passano gli alimenti,
le voglie, i santi, i malcontenti.
Non ci si pu bagnare
due volte nello stesso fiume,
n prevedere i cambiamenti di costume.
E intanto passa ignaro
il vero senso della vita.
Ci cambiano capelli, denti e seni,
a noi che siamo solo di passaggio.

In meinen HÃ¤nden werden WÃ¶rter zu Patronen
Immer wenn Ich einen Vers rappe,
Kommt es dir vor als ob ich nie was anderes gelernt hÃ¤tte.
Rapper hÃ¶ren im Fluss
StoÃen dabei an ihre Schmerzgrenze
Du bekommst die besten Reime
Druckfrisch aus der WerkstÃ¤tte
Immer wenn Ich schreib
FÃ¼hlt es sich an wie ein Befreiungsakt
Alles muss perfekt sein
Jedes Wort hat seinen eigenen Platz
Und solang' noch einer beim Konzert steht
Und mir Beifall klatscht
Lade ich meine Feder
Und schieÃ' die Reime zum Takt
FlieÃende Tinte wird zu wÃ¼tenden FlÃ¼ssen
Alles muss raus
Immer wieder kommt es zu lyrischen GefÃ¼hlsausbrÃ¼chen
Ich setz' mich und durchlÃ¶cher' das Blatt mit FÃ¼llerschÃ¼ssen
Jede Zeile trifft
Kein Problem fÃ¼r 'nen geÃ¼bten SchÃ¼tzen
Das alles ist selbstgemacht
Keine VertrÃ¤ge
Mir geht es besser
Denn Schreiben reinigt den Geist und die Seele
Denn wenn Ich schreibe scheiÃ ich auf das Game
Ich scheiÃ` auf die Knete
Ich mache es um den Kopf freizukriegen und weiÃ das Ich lebe

Und plÃ¶tzlich fÃ¼hl' Ich die Magie

Ich schreibe bis mein iPhone keinen Saft mehr hat
Die Miene bricht, die Tinte spritzt
Kein Satz mehr auf das Blatt hin passt
Und spende meinem Hobby jede freie Minute
Bis Ich mir denk` der Text ist fertig
Immer wenn ich Reime suche
PrÃ¤sentiere Ich mein Gedankengut in Form einer Vokabelflut
Ich lass' es einfach laufen
Ich lass es einfach raus
Denn Immer wieder greif' Ich zum Stift
Es ist wie Rettung in Not
Ich bin mir sicher nicht nur mir spenden die SÃ¤tze hier Trost
Ich bin ganz zufrieden
Wenn wirklich jede Phase einen Sinn ergibt
Der Flow so richtig rollt
Und jeder Buchstabe dann richtig sitzt
Ich brauch' keine
Die mehr, ich dann
Doch Ich will schreiben was ich will
Weil mir die Message halt noch wichtig ist
Sie nennen mich einen RevolutionÃ¤r
Ich schieÃ' den Text wie ein Gewehr
Keines der BlÃ¤tter bleibt mehr leer
Ich schieb' die SÃ¤tze hin und her bis es perfekt ist
Jeder Vers trÃ¤gt meine Handschrift

Why are we throwing those stones
Cold sweat and blistering, sounds like a plea to me
Don't just go throwing your words, save your breath and be still
Save your breath and be still
No other drummers have went quite this dark
There's still light but you can't close the _________
You won't know if you're coming in light 'til your ship has arrived
Relish this moment, 'til death do us part
I want answers before it's too late
Take your time old man, take your time
Take your time old man, take your time
These vultures are happy to wait
Savor the sympathy, one final victory_________
Bring me ____________, look it's not hard to find
Scariness under your bed, save your breath and be still
Save your breath and be still
No other drummers have went quite this dark
There's still light but you can't close the ________
You won't know if you're coming in light til your ship has arrived
Relish this moment, 'til death do us part
I want answers before it's too late
Take your time old man
These vultures are happy to wait
I'd like to forgive and forget, but I can't
It's just one of the ways that I'm petty
I'll leave you to carry this weight, to burden the rest of your days
I'll leave you to carry this weight, all alone
And no single regret to the grave
It's not like it used to be, ancient history
Why are we throwing those stones
Cold sweat and blistering, sounds like a plea to me
Don't just go throwing your words, save your breath and be still
Save your breath and be still
No other drummers have went quite this dark
There's still light but you can't close the ________
You won't know if you're coming in light 'til your ship has arrived
Relish this moment, 'til death do us part
I want answers before it's too late
Take your time old man
These vultures are happy to wait<start>Don't you want me to stay?
Make a rocking horse getaway.
The radio says we're in for a fall.
The TV says nothing at all.
Nothing at all.
Nothing at all.
Out of my window, it echoes my heart.
I've been checking for change since the start.
Collide into me, I could do with a fight.
Collide into me, cause it feels right.
Does the honesty deceive?
Try to find a way to leave this party.
Take it out on me cause
All the honesty shut this place down.
Your bowling ball eyes have nothing to say.
They knock me over again anyway.
Collide into me, I could do with a fight.
Collide into me, cause it feels right.
Does the honesty deceive?
Try to find a way to leave this party.
Take it out on me cause
All the honesty shut this place down.
The broken hearts of my neighborhood
Lay cast aside like dreams in Hollywood,
With the boarded up windows at the closing sale.
Does the honesty deceive?
Try to find a way to leave this party.
Take it out on me cause
All the honesty shut this place down.
Does the honesty deceive?
Try to find a way to leave this party.
Take it out on me cause
All the honesty shut this place down.<start>With sense of irony, everyone
You see is chasing their illusion
Take a dive or sink or swim
But in the end
You're in the same pollution
In your world escape is swift
The nonsense list
Is all you need to know
In the land of dreams
You make the right connections
Then you'll be the hero
Ecstasy
The cult of me provides
Our institutions
You can live forever
Besides a grave that stands
Where people used to function
You can join
The saviors of our culture
Vultures circling
Overhead my sky
Like the sin of gluttony
Won't set you free
(But Betty Ford can help you try)
You can get all the things
You never needed
You can sell people crap
And make them eat it
Where is our John Wayne
Where is our sacred cowboys now?
Where are the Indians on the hill
There's no Indians left to kill
People die with oxygen
And all their money
Can afford a breath
People starving everywhere
And staring in the face of death
Prostitutes and politicians
Laying in their beds together
You can be the savior
Of the poor
Making up the policies
To open the back door<start>I got my girl, I want your girl

Hopin' that it doesn't come too late
Hearin' the sirens in the distance
Hold on help is on the way
Mister Ambulance Driver I'm right here beside her
And though I'll live somehow I've found
Mister Ambulance Driver I'm not a real survivor
'Cause I'm wishing that I was the one that
Wasn't gonna be here anymore
The one that wasn't here anymore
The one that wasn't here anymore
Oh we can't trade places
Our lives are strangely our own
Mister Ambulance Driver tell me
For everyone that dies, someone new is born

And head on down to Washington
And I want you to climb up high
High in the sky and shoot them all
Th-th-they, d-d-don't deserve to live
What did they ever give to you?
Na na na na na
You know what I want you to do?
I want you to go upstairs to that apartment
Where that guy keeps playing that Barry Manilow record
Copacabana over and over and over again
I want you to ring the doorbell
And when he answers the door
I want you to stab him in the neck
With a number 2 pencil over and over and over again
Because he must pay, chop him up, put him in the freezer
And as you leave the apartment, light the place on fire
Voices in my head, these are
The voices in my head
Voices in my head these are
The voices in my ear
You should dress up like a clown
Hi, you never called me back
I got the pictures back from Thanksgiving
I don't know why you wear that earring?
If your father was alive, I don't know what he'd say
I was talking to Mrs. Corelli yesterday
You know Bobby Corelli who was in your grade?
He got promoted again in his law firm
He's making 175,000 a year now, are you on drugs?
Why don't you ever call me back?
When are you gonna get married son?
Isn't it about time you settled down and got yourself a wife
And got yourself a house and got a kid and got a car
And got a dog and got a lawnmower and got a nice picket fence
Voices in my head, these are
The voices in my head
Voices in my head
These are the voices in my head
The voices in my head
Why, why is it every time I gotta wait on a fuckin' line?
Why is it every time I turn on my television set
I gotta see Sally Struthers and those starving kids?
Why can't somebody just send her a check
And shut her and those god damn kips up?
Where's Rob Reiner when you need him?
Why, why don't they drop the bomb
Right on top of everyone?

Swears, I'm the only one for her
But she never wants to be alone with me
She says she's only havin' fun
And I hope that she
Will come running back to me
In this reality
She goes out every weekend
Yeah, hangin' with all my friends
No matter what I do, I just can't win
And I think, I think she's gonna dump me
Stood me up on Tuesday
Our 3 month anniversary
I might not make it through the day
Well I think, think she's gonna dump me, yeah, oh no
I want her to wear my ring
But she flirts with everyone but me
It's like I've got a bad disease
She says she's only havin' fun
And it's killing me
I hope that she's still mine
In this reality
She goes out every weekend
Yeah, hangin' with all my friends
No matter what I do, I just can't win

Our 3 month anniversary

Well, I think, think she's gonna dump me, yeah, oh no, yeah, oh no
I came home from picking up roses
I wanna make it all okay
She left a message for me
And when I pushed play
I'm busy this weekend
And I'm sleeping with your best friend
Sorry this is the end
I think she dumped me
But he's only gonna use her
They could never be what we were
And I feel like a loser
'Cause she just, she just dumped me
Stood me up on Tuesday
Our 3 month anniversary
She told everyone, I might be gay
And then she, and then she dumped me, yeah
She's so mean
She just dumped me, yeah
On my machine
She just dumped me, yeah

den ich nicht verstanden hab.
Doch er muss wohl witzig gewesen sein,
denn die anderen haben gelacht.
Sie schlugen sich auf die Schenkel
und hielten sich ihren Bauch.
Dieser Witz muss ein Treffer gewesen sein,
denn das Lachen hrte nicht mehr auf.
Ha, ha, ha!
Ha, ha, ha!
Es war ein richtig guter Witz,
bestimmt fllt er mir gleich wieder ein.
Sich an einen Witz zu erinnern,
kann manchmal sehr schwer sein.
Dieser Witz war witzig -
so unglaublich witzig.
Er war wirklich witzig -
so witzig.
Es war irgendwas mit Negern oder war es mit Ostfriesen?
Mit Schwulen oder Trken oder waren's Vietnamesen?
Juden oder Ossis oder waren's nur Blondinen?
Auf jeden Fall war's komisch, das weiss ich ganz bestimmt!
Einen Witz gut erzhlen zu knnen,
ist sicher eine hohe Kunst.
Denk dir einen Witz aus
und lach dich drber tot.
Ha, ha, ha!
Unglaublich witzig.
Ha, ha, ha!
Wirklich witzig.
Ha, ha, ha!
Unfassbar witzig.
Ha, ha, ha!<start>Got love, if that's what you need
I got three or four babies sittin' on my knee
I got love waitin' for you
I come sneakin' round the corner of the avenue
You gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, or I will get you
You know you gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, before I get you
There's one thing that's on my mind
And that's getting hold of you before I serve my time
I'll keep on, with my heavy load
Till I see you come a strollin' down that open road
You gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, or I will get you
You know you gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, before I get you
I love you Ma-Ma-Ma Belle
That's why I want to get it all well I'm sure you can tell
I got, good soul, runnin' so deep
Gonna get you in the corner so that I can keep
Can't you hear me once Ma-Ma-Ma Belle

Mouth slack and wide
Ill-housed and ill-advised
Your face is as clean
As your life has been, so
Crash into my arms
I want you
You don't agree
But you don't refuse
I know you
And I know a place
Where no one is likely to pass
You don't care if it's late
And, you don't care if you're lost
And oh, you look so tired
But tonight you presume too much
Too much, too much
And if it's the last thing I ever do
I'm gonna get you<start>She knows that I'm waiting by the door
I know that she's trying
To cover up staring at the floor
Let's go, don't say, maybe
Forget everyone around let's together and get down
I know it sounds crazy one, two, three times a lady
Oh no, I've got the notion
Let's get together and start the commotion
Round and round till everyone stops
'Til the next needle on the record player drops
It's almost time to say our goodbyes
And get home tonight
Let's do it up one more time
Show these people what we had in mind
Let's go, don't say, maybe
Forget everyone around let's together and get down
I know it sounds crazy one, two, three times a lady
Oh no, I've got the notion

You were wrong when you said everything's gonna be alright
You were right when you said all that glitters isn't gold
You were right when you said all we are is dust in the wind

And when you said manic depression's a frustrated mess
You were wrong when you said everything's gonna be alright

You were right when you said this is the end<start>You're playing with my weakness
I'm sliding in the dark
I'm falling so deeply
I don't see your mercy
And I don't see your signs

Perhaps it takes too long we go astray
Stop playing God
This is no game
Abusing your power
Without any shame
Stop playing God
I can't stand no more
Stop playing God
Stop playing God
We overcome the crisis
But did we change a thing ?
We're crawling, crawling deeper
Fuck the new millennium
We're learning how to kill
They never teach you what it's like for real
Stop playing God
This is no game
Abusing your power
Without any shame
Stop playing God

Refusing you

Call the preacher we must pray
Round up the kids 'cause this is
Not your average wedding day
What do we have?
Seven brides for seven sinners
What do we need?
Father, son, and holy smokes
Just, get them to the church on time
How could this happen? Has hell frozen over?
Don't question lest you go insane
Oh, when sons of loggers marry
Daughters of gold digging squatters
Quiet towns are never quite the same
What do we have?
Seven brides for seven sinners
What do we need?
Hollers, guns, and rolling oats
What do we have?
Seven brides for seven sinners
What do we need?
Father, son, and holy smokes
Just, get them to the church on time
The girls are saints the boys are sinners
Come place your bets at church for winners
Don't question miracles of God
A marriage so disparaged is the stitch
When rich and poor are hitching
Just run when lightning strikes the rod
What do we have?
Seven brides for seven sinners
What do we need?
Hollers, guns, and rolling oats

Seven brides for seven sinners

Let me welcome you here officially
To the back drop of martini clatter
Break the ice with superficial chatter
I'm glad to be this year's MC
To greet the chic and the elite
Yeah, you finally get to mix and mingle
Pressing flesh until your fingers tingle
Worldwide socialites unite
OK, alright
The band is grander than I recall
The talk is cultured, if a little small
Keep parading your charading manners
Keep pretending that it really matters
Don't ask, don't tell
And please don't stare at the emperor
In his underwear
Special thanks to the snack committee
Heavens, don't those tarts look pretty
Worldwide socialites unite
Enjoy the conversation
But try to keep it light
Just avoid the friction
And if you feel conviction
Well then, baby, step outside
Let's keep the "lite" in social
Let's keep the social light
Let's keep the "lite" in socialite
Worldwide socialites unite
Avoid the dreaded question
The meaning of our lives
And as to God's existence
Well, that's your private business
And, quite frankly, impolite

Seen a little girl crying along the way
She'd been hurt so bad said she'd never love again
Some day your crying girl will end
And you'll find once again
Two hearts are better than one
Two hearts girl get the job done
Two hearts are better than one
Once I spent my time playing tough guy scenes
But I was living in a world of childish dreams
Someday these childish dreams must end
To become a man and grow up to dream again
I believe in the end
Two hearts are better than one
Two hearts girl get the job done
Two hearts are better than one
Sometimes it might seem like it was planned
For you to roam empty-hearted through this land
Though the world turns you hard and cold
There's one thing mister, that I know
That's if you think your heart is stone
And that you're rough enough to whip this world alone
Alone buddy there ain't no peace of mind
That's why I'll keep searching 'til I find my special one
Two hearts are better than one
Two hearts girl get the job done
Two hearts are better than one
Oh, two hearts are better than one

Two hearts are better than one

Find my way out in the world
Somethin's callin' me and I can't stay
As the leaves are fallin' down
Soon the snow upon the ground
Hope you'll understand, why I can't stay
Waiting for the sun
As I start to run
Waiting for the sun
Though I'm young not quite a man
I'll try and do the best I can
Duty calls my friends are all aboard
Feel the wind across my face
Standing ready all in place
With this trigger I'll become a man
Waiting for the sun
Will I make it home, again?
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for
See the people falling down
Crimson colors all around
Tryin' to make it to the higher ground
Mother dear I had to go
Even though I loved you so
Sorry but I won't be comin' home
Waiting for the sun
As I start to run
Waiting for
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun<start>If I had my way
If I had to lose
Wouldn't take back one thing, never had much to choose
Then it dawned on me
Coming down on you
Like a cold sky raining under a burning moon
You've waited all your life
Your wish is coming true
Bless your heart for beating me right outta you
Miss the misery
Need a reason for a change
Need a reason to explain
So turn it on again
Don't change your mind
Your wasting light
Get in and let's
Go, go
What a nice long leash
What a nice tight noose
Never worked for me but sure look good on you
You've waited all your life
Your wish is coming true
Bless your heart for beating me right outta you
Miss the misery
Need a reason for a change
Need a reason to refrain
So turn it on again
Don't change your mind
Your wasting light
Get in and let's
Go, go!

Gimme a reason for a change
Miss the misery
Gimme a reason to refrain
Miss your misery in a day

Go, go<start>We almost shared a dream
We almost made it as a team
How nice it would have been.
We almost touched the stars
And there stood heaven, almost ours
We were just outsiders looking in.
We had the chance to fall
But fate stepped in to end it all
Before it could begin.
And if it's true, you're really going
There's nothing but goodbye to say
The saddest part of all is knowing
We almost went all the way<start>Could it be that I am just a product
Of my own selfishness?
Could it be that I am just a model
That no one should follow?
Couldn't take Your word as it was given
Predestined to wander
So I'm here to reflect and to ponder
Where I've gone, I miss You
Replace this weight I feel
Break this heart until
I feel You breathing
I'm falling over You
Hearing this voice again
All across my skin
I feel you breathing
I'm falling over You again
Falling over You again
My reasons are gone
You knew all along
That I would be falling over You again
Without You it felt wrong
It wouldn't be long
'Till I would be falling over You again
Can I go back to when it was just us?
I could care less what life brought to us
I never will understand why I left this
When I felt more, I trusted You
I knew this was wrong
But I needed to be on my own
Now it's been so long
Since my freedom is me bound to You<start>Did you ever see the concrete stares of everyday?
The lunatic, the hypocrite are all lost in the fray
Can't you see their lives are just like yours?
An unturned stone, and undiscovered
Door leading to
The gift of hope renewed
Eternity for you
The masses of humanity have always had to suffer
The business man whose master plan controls the world each day
Is blind to indications of his species of his species' slow decay
People blow their minds
They choose to resign
This deformed society is part of a design
It'll never go away
It's in the cards that way
The masses of humanity have always had to suffer<start>The panorama of the city is wrong
In fact the city seems to be gone!
Burning rubber and smoke in my eyes
There's a flat burning junkheap
For twenty square miles!
They took it into the nuclear mine
Judging by this, they left nothing behind
Down in the bunkers in the crust of the earth
Now crouch the wealthy and the noble of birth
If I could a ride a train around the city
That holds this as our fate
I'd hide from electro-circuit central
To the shock inducer gate
Not forgetting the by-pass
Across the Washington hooks
Through the phones and desks and screens
Of the Kremlin's crook of crooks
There's some panel in a circuit board
Destination of the override
Scanning the wild wind
Blowing through the Berlin corridor
Spotlit in a palace, shielded from dust
Malfunction or not, the fail safe is the crux
So far away from us,
Shaking with the mystery tears
One lonely night in Ladbroke Grove
Far away in the deserts of Omaha!
They got it nailed down-Swiss tight!
The bank notes of Europe
The emperors and kings
Curl in the autumn as the burning of leaves
And I've cleaned my black guitar<start>Yesterday I would not have believed
That tomorrow the sun would shine
Then one day you came into my life
I am alive again I am alive again
All the empty yesterdays have disappeared
Now that you have filled my life with love
No one else could ever mean so much to me
Every day my high lasts longer
As our love grows ever stronger
Yesterday I would not have believed
That tomorrow the sun would shine
Then one day you came into my life
I am alive again I am alive again
When you gave your love to me you changed my life
Dreams that once seemed hopeless come with ease
Thank you girl for being just the way you are
I would never try to change you
All I live for is to love you
I'm feeling alive again
I'm feeling alive again<start>Cuando me muera y me tengan que enterrar

Para que no me de miedo estar abajo
Para que no se me olvide como es tu cara
Para imaginar que estoy contigo
Y sentirme un poquito vivo
Matenme porque me muero
Matenme porque no puedo
Matenme porque me muero
Matenme porque no puedo
Esta enfermedad es incurable
Esta enfermedad ni con un valium, no.
Cuando me muera y me tengan que enterrar
Quiero que sea con dulces y no con piedras
Por si alguna vez me buscas
EstarÃ© eternamente lejos
Como para darte solo flores
Te guardare mil estrellas
Matenme porque me muero
Matenme porque no puedo
Matenme porque me muero
Matenme porque me muero<start>If you really love him and there's nothing that I can do
Don't try to spare my feelings, just tell me that we're through
And make it easy on yourself, ''cause breaking up is so very hard to do
If the way I hold you can't compare to his caress
No words of consolation will make me miss you less,
My darling.. if this is goodbye, I just know I'm gonna cry,
So run to him before you start crying too...<start>This is what they say
You go to school
So you'll move
Just like the rest
And if I say that I dont wanna feel
If I say that I dont wanna kneel
If I say that I just want to be
Free!
Break free
Don't fear
Look upon tell me what you feel
What you feel
What you see
Yeah,
Bring the fire on
Take a step up
To the underworld
To the underwold
Excuse me mother
I need to go on
Excuse me father
I need to run
Wel,l nothing's wrong
Yeah
I'm here to rock and roll!
Never said that I don't wanna feel
And If I say that I dont wanna kneel
Yeah
If I say that I dont wanna feel yeah
Will you still love, love me?<start>Oh Rodney won't you play this song tonight?
O radio can you save my soul tonight?
Cause we saw you standing there
Please don't deny it
Waiting for the show to start
I left feeling low, did you feel the same way I did?
Alone with a broken heart
So radio radio get us through the night
When pop heroes go down without a fight
500 parkas were in the house tonight
Looking good and feeling right
Cigarettes were burning bright
That dance hall it was out of sight!
Time to set this place alight
But let's be honest now
Now let the truth be told
The only salvation for us tonight is to turn on the radio
So Rodney, we need you tonight
Oh Rodney won't you play this song tonight?
O radio can you save our ship tonight?
And now I guess the night is done
There's nothings left open and no place for fun
So we turn on the radio
Light a fuse cause I'm about to blow
The streets are empty
My heart is heavy
So slowly I will go
By the neon lights of the city glow
[Chorus]
Just pick one out for me
Make it loud and hard and fast
Play the songs that we love
Cause the modern world just kicked our ass
Just pick one out for us
Loud and deep and true
Play the songs that we love
When the heroes still came through<start>Who's the one that makes you happy
Who's the one that always makes you laugh
Who's the reason you're smiling
And dragged you through these time, so rough
I was the one that made you happy
I was the one that eased the pain
But I'm the reason that you're crying now
My own tears scattered by the rain
You can sacrifice me
You can sacrifice me
You can set me free
You can be who you want to be
Deeper than deep you took me on a trip baby
You shared your wildest dreams and more
You dare me to express my feelings to you
I never felt that need before
But suddenly you needed freedom
You felt the need to break free
You started drowning in your sorrow
You didn't want to know I had the key
You can sacrifice me
You can sacrifice me
You can set me free
You can be who you want to to be
You can sacrifice me, sacrifice me
You can be who you want to
You can be who you want to be<start>If you leave me now
You'll take away the biggest part of me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, baby please don't go
And if you leave me now
You'll take away the very heart of me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, baby please don't go
Oh, oh, oh, oh, girl, I just want you to stay
A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could we let it slip away
We've come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret
The things we said today
A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could we let it slip away
We've come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret
The things we said today
If you leave me now
You'll take away the biggest part of me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, baby please don't go
Oh, girl, I just got to have you by my side
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, baby please don't go
Oh, my, my, I just got to have your loving<start>(English: The Heart's Region)

Lately I've been feelin' somethin' else
These thoughts ain't helping me, to let go of your memory
Lately I just ain't been myself
There's a time to hurt, a time to heal
Yeah but lately, that just ain't the way I feel
Like some famous final scene, I saw once on my TV screen
You'll come back to me, ain't that the way that it's supposed to be
(Chorus)...I said, You're the one I hold onto
You're the one who gets me through
Every second without you
Is just wasted time
You can take my soul, you can take my freedom
Take my heart cuz I won't need it Every second without you
I've come to find
Is just wasted time...
So many things I can't replace
I miss your smile, your tears, the lines on your pretty face
Didn't know what I lost until you were gone
What felt so right, now feels so wrong
The same road that carries me
Is now the one that buries me, you see...
(CHORUS)
All the things I meant to say are now so clear
I know what I'd say if you were standin' here
Somewhere between the dark and the light
Between the who's wrong and the who's right
Between the hellos and the goodbyes
If you were here with me tonight, I'd say
(Chorus)<start>Where did they go?
You're left behind
It seems like you are
Deaf and blind
Crowded crossroads, shops and squares
Nobody's there
You'll never be that strong
Little man
You've always stayed behind
Losing them
They didn't see you trying hard
To bounce off the ground
You were an invisible
Soundless cloud
Crowded crossroads, shops and squares
And you standing there
Trying the best you can
You can find your own place
you naver had
Oh, trying the best you can
Nevermind what's next
You can't lose again
Trying the best you
Nevermind what's now
But it's not the end<start>I have waited
For your love
For so long
How do i go on?
I have told you
So many times
It's no good
You're treating me so wrong.
Out there so far away
Above the sky will say
For you...
Here it comes again
It's all around me
It must be magic
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I can see you
In my mind
The lost time
That you're saving
I could reach out
And touch you
What can i do?
The sun ain't shining.
Out there so far away
Above the sky will say
For you...<start>It's not up to me, its not A13
It's not the Circle K at the top of street
I know it may seem debonnaire
But there's time on the line that we just can't spare
Hold up everybody, put it all on ice
Gotta feeling on the mic that's twice as nice
Gotta cope with the dope by cutting soap
So turned on livin' out my horoscope
No one can do it like we can
We take the stand with a master plan
We are the educated, motivated, skin tight, rawhide, hardworkin',
Blood sweatin', Hollerin', your world wreckin'
Ladies of eighty three
Ladies you want to be
We're not the first but that matters least
'Cause there's free rough justice for the masterpiece

Never gonna get ninety nine percent
My get up and go just got up and went
So unrelenting, pay strict attention
My mind is heading In the right direction
More hits than bazooka smooth
Our guarantee is we can move
Our Q and A don't ricochet
We make the play with a double A
We are the educated, motivated, skin tight, rawhide, hardworkin',
Blood sweatin, hollerin, your world wreckin'

You wanna bring it back like me
Yeah!
Yeah!<start>One soft infested summer, me and Terry became friends
Trying in vain to breathe the fire we was born in
Catching rides to the outskirts, tying faith between our teeth
Sleeping in that old abandoned beach house, getting wasted in the heat
And hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets
With a love so hard and filled with defeat
Running for our lives at night on them backstreets
Slow dancing in the dark on the beach at Stockton's Wing
Where desperate lovers park, we sat with the last of the Duke Street Kings
Huddled in our cars, waiting for the bells that ring
In the deep heart of the night they set us loose of everything
To go running on the backstreets
Running on the backstreets
Terry, you swore we'd live forever
Taking it on them backstreets together
Endless juke joints and Valentino drag
Where famous dancers scraped the tears up off the street, dressed down in rags
Running into the darkness, some hurt bad, some really dying
At night sometimes it seemed you could hear the whole damn city crying
Blame it on the lies that killed us, blame it on the truth that ran us down
You can blame it all on me, Terry, it don't matter to me now
When the breakdown hit at midnight, there was nothing to say
But I hated him, and I hated you when you went away
Laying here in the dark, you're like an angel on my chest
Just another tramp of hearts crying tears of faithlessness
Remember all the movies, Terry, we'd go see
Trying to learn to walk like the heroes we thought we had to be
And after all this time, to find we're just like all the rest
Stranded in the park and forced to confess
To hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets
Where we swore forever friends
On the backstreets until the end<start>Well, I got a baby crazy for me
Yeah, I got a baby won't let me be
Who, baby baby, Clarabella
Baby baby, Clarabella
Baby baby, wo wo, yeah uh
Well, she needs no coaching on making love
All she needs is the stars up above
Who, baby baby, Clarabella

You're my honey, Clarabella
Ooh yeah now, Clarabella

Already knows her ABC's

Baby baby, wo wo, yeah yeh
Ahh ow! Woo<start>Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I know I'm gonna die
Goodbye my love bye bye
There goes our lady
With a "you know who"
I hope she's happy
And "old 'Clapper' too"
We had good rhythm
(and a little slide)
Then she stepped in
Did me a favour
I threw them both out.
(Hmm) goodbye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye my love bye bye
(Hmm) bye bye love (Hmm)
It's gonna be a raining out of doors
(Hmm) hello happiness (Hmm)
Goodbye my love goodbye
Now I'm into romance
I shy away from love
Got tired of ladies (ooh ooh)
That plot and shove me
And that's the reason
We all can (see) so clearly
They see that our lady
Is out on a 'spree'
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
Think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello emptiness<start>Come on baby, hold my hand
Tell me you'll understand
Friday night, I can't go out
You know I play guitar in a band
Gotta make money and weekend's seem
To be the best time to play
Be glad to have you come along
Why can't you see it that way?
Ooo you know my jokes are clever
Ooo but I can go on like this forever
Repeat entire song<start>[Talib Kweli]
Yo Dee (What?)
Come on (Yeah..)
What? What? Come on

"Give me the fortune, keep the fame," said my man Louis
I agreed, know what he mean because we live the truest lie
I asked him why we follow the law of the bluest eye
He looked at me, he thought about it
Was like, "I'm clueless, why?"
The question was rhetorical, the answer is horrible
Our morals are out of place and got our lives full of sorrow
And so tomorrow comin later than usual
Waitin' on someone to pity us
While we findin beauty in the hideous
They say money's the root of all evil but I can't tell
YouknowhatImean, pesos, francs, yens, cowrie shells, dollar bills
Or is it the mindstate that's ill?
Creating crime rates to fill the new prisons they build
Over money and religion there's more blood to spill
The wounds of slaves in cotton fields that never heal
What's the deal?
A lot of cats who buy records are straight broke
But my language universal they be recitin my quotes
While R&B; singers hit bad notes, we rock the boat
of thought, that my man Louis' statements just provoked
Caught up, in conversations of our personal worth
Brought up, through endangered species status on the planet Earth
Survival tactics means, bustin gats to prove you hard
Your firearms are too short to box with God
Without faith, all of that is illusionary
Raise my son, no vindication of manhood necessary
[M.D.]	Not strong
[T.K.]	Only aggressive

[T.K.]	Chasin after death
so we can call ourselves brave?

[Mos Def]
Yo, I'm sure that everbody out listenin agree
That everything you see ain't really how it be
A lot of jokers out runnin in place, chasin the style
Be a lot goin on beneath the empty smile
Most cats in my area be lovin the hysteria
Synthesized surface conceals the interior
America, land of opportunity, mirages and camoflauges
More than usually -- speakin loudly, sayin nothin
You confusin me, you losin me
Your game is twisted, want me enlisted -- in your usary
Foolishly, most men join the ranks cluelessly
Buffoonishly accept the deception, believe the perception
Reflection rarely seen across the surface of the lookin glass
Walkin the street, wonderin who they be lookin past
Lookin gassed with them imported designer shades on
Stars shine bright, but the light -- rarely stays on
Same song, just remixed, different arrangement
Put you on a yacht but they won't call it a slaveship
Strangeness, you don't control this, you barely hold this
Screamin brand new, when they just sanitized the old shit
Suppose it's, just another clever Jedi mind trick
That they been runnin across stars through all the time with
I find it's distressin, there's never no in-between
We either niggaz or Kings
We either bitches or Queens
The deadly ritual seems immersed, in the perverse
Full of short attention spans, short tempers, and short skirts
Long barrel automatics released in short bursts
The length of black life is treated with short worth
Get yours first, them other niggaz secondary
That type of illin that be fillin up the cemetary
This life is temporary but the soul is eternal
Separate the real from the lie, let me learn you
Not strong, only aggressive, cause the power ain't directed
That's why, we are subjected to the will of the oppressive
Not free, we only licensed
Not live, we just excitin
Cause the captors.. own the masters.. to what we writin
Not compassionate, only polite, we well trained
Our sincerity's rehearsed in stage, it's just a game
Not good, but well behaved cause the ca-me-ra survey
most of the things that we think, do, or say
We chasin after death just to call ourselves brave
But everyday, next man meet with the grave
I give a damn if any fan recall my legacy
I'm tryin to live life in the sight of God's memory
Like that y'all
[Mos Def]
A lot of people don't understand the true criteria of things
Can't just accept the appearance
Have to get the true essence
[Talib Kweli]
They ain't lookin around
[M.D.]	Not strong
[T.K.]	Only aggressive
[M.D.]	Not free
[T.K.]	We only licensed
[M.D.]	Not compassioniate, only polite
[T.K.]	Now who the nicest?
[M.D.]	Not good but well behaved
[T.K.]	Chasin after death

It was the next big thing
Exploding over our heads
And soon the next generation
Will emerge from behind the bike sheds
What are we going to offer 'em
The exact same thing as before
But a different way to wear it
And the promise of a whole lot more
Oh pity the pressures at the top
The tantrums and the tears
And the sound of platinum cash deals
Ringin' in their ears
Money maketh man a Tory
Don't fire that assumption at me
I like toast as much as anyone
But not for breakfast dinner and tea
So don't saddle me with your ideals
And spare me all your guilt
For a poet with all the answers
Has never yet been built
I see no shame in putting my name
To socialism's cause
Nor seeking some more relevance
Than spotlight and applause
Neither in the name of conscience
Nor the name of charity
Money is put where mouths are
In the name of solidarity
We sing of freedom
And we speak of liberation
But such chances come
But once a generation
So I'll ignore what I am sure
Were the best of your intentions
You were judged by your actions
And not by your pretensions
There's drudgery in social change
And glory for the few
And if you don't tell me what not to say
I won't tell you what not to do<start>Jenny come back from California
She said her mother's doing fine
Jenny come back from California
With a sparkle in her eye

Early last June, she bought a round trip ticket
To San Francisco by the bay.
Trouble at home, she said she couldn't take it.
She needed time to get away.

Jenny come back from California.
With a brand new pair of shoes
Jenny come back from California
She come back without her blues
Solo:
(repeat chords of verse)
Well there's something about that ocean
that's got a romantic feeling
When you're standing by the shore
A little more time, a lot more healing
Maybe she'll love me once more
(repeat chords of chorus)
Jenny come back from California.
A little lighter when she steps.
Jenny come back from California
Full of life with no regrets
(bridge)
Never knew what she saw in San Francisco
Maybe moonlight by the sea
It can fall off in the water
Just as long as she comes back to me.
(repeat chords of chorus)
Jenny come back from California
With a brand new diamond ring
Jenny come back from California
She gathered up the rest of her things.
Jenny went back to California.<start>Waffle of the ancients
way too much of bobby
laying in the gutter
Abraham Lincoln Beard<start>I'll sing you this song
Filled with words that make no sense
Played with chords that never ends
Please just give me one more chance
To sing this song to you
To sing to you this song
This senseless song
I'd never thought that I'd be
Captured by your smile
You rock my world, without you
I can't imagine life
I close my eyes
It see your face that huants me
Deep down inside
And so i pick up my guitar
And hear me sing this senseless song
All this song i sing
what joy it may bring
It's all about a story
Of a hopeless romantic fool
Thanks singing along
I will leave you with this song
Coz i may pass away
But this song will always be
With you
You'll never miss the water
Till the well is went dry
You'll never miss the moments
Till it pass you by
You'll never miss the time
While i'm still here
You'll never miss me
Till i disappear<start>Moving forward using all my breath
Making love to you was never second best
I saw the world thrashing all around your face
Never really knowing it was always mesh and lace
I'll stop the world and melt with you
You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time
There's nothing you and I won't do
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(You should know better)
Dream of better lives the kind which never hate
(You should see why)
Dropped in the state of imaginary grace
(You should know better)
I made a pilgrimage to save this human race
(You should see why)
Never comprehending a race that long gone by
(I'll stop the world)
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(I'll stop the world)
You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time
(Let's stop the world)
There's nothing you and I won't do
(Let's stop the world)
I'll stop the world and melt with you
The future's open wide
(Let's stop the world)
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(Let's stop the world)
I've seen some changes but it's getting better all the time
(Let's stop the world)
There's nothing you and I won't do
(Let's stop the world)
I'll stop the world and melt with you
The future's open wide
Na na na
Na na na na
Na na na
Na na na na
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(Let's stop the world)
You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time
(Let's stop the world)
There's nothing you and I won't do
(Let's stop the world)
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(Let's stop the world)
I'll stop the world and melt with you...<start>Been a hard day
But Im feeling sane
Though they point at me
With their fingers of blame
My lifes derailed
And I know its a shame
Could get on track
But is that my aim
Apologize, destined to apologize
Apologize, destined to apologize
Its a fresh day
But adrenalins low
And I ask myself
Should I just let go
Wanting to sleep
But its to-and-fro
If I take that leap
Will they even know?
Apologize, destined to apologize
Apologize, destined to apologize
Cant read the future
No believing in miracles
Im just stepping on water
Stumbling into some order
Cant read the future
No believing in miracles
Im just stepping on water
Stumbling into some order
Yeah just stepping on water
Making it through
And Im satisfied
When I hear them say
Ive death defied
When they crowd round
I still wanna hide
But my head is straight
And Im laughing inside
Apologize, destined to apologize
Apologize, destined to apologize
Cant read the future
No believing in miracles
Im just stepping on water
Stumbling into some order
Cant read the future
No believing in miracles
Im just stepping on water
Stumbling into some order
Yeah just stepping on water<start>Shut down the gospel singers and
Turn up the old heartbreakers
I'm dying to tell you that I'm dying here
Throw up the sickly joy and I'll
Swallow the sweet self-loathing I'm
Just dying to be unhappy again
Oh where love won't grow
Oh I'll build my home
And if happiness won't come to me
Hand me the nitrous gas
Leave the acute warm heartedness
Go where the joyless bastard lives
He's dying to bring you down with him
Suck in the bright red major key
Spit out the blue minor misery
I'm dying to bring you down with me
Oh, oh, oh, oh
But if happiness won't come to me
Hand me the nitrous gas
You can keep all of your oxygen
Hand me the nitrous gas
If happiness won't live with me
I think I can live with that
Keep all of your oxygen
Hand me the nitrous gas<start>I'm lost in imagination
Still contemplate animation
I just groove on your breathing
I do it all for you
You've got a problem witcha boyfriend
He don't squeeze you right
He got you facedown and waiting, baby
Keep you waiting all night
So do me a favour
Won't you
Move with me slowly
Get too close to me
Move with me slowly
Just like we're meant to be
Just like we're meant to be
Hey say sister
You're dreaming
You got stars in your eyes
A little conscious behavior
Is gonna cut
You down to size
You hear me knocking
So let me in
When your blood runs cold
And your love wears thin
It's over passion
It's under the skin
If love ain't a miracle
It sure ain't a sin
So let me in
Take me to the city
Take me on my knees
Take me anyway
You find me baby
I've got this love disease
And there ain't nothin'
I can do<start>(duet with Ryan Adams / Rolling Stones Cover)
Take me to the station and put me on a train
I've got no expectations to pass through here again
Once I was a rich man and now I am so poor
But never in my sweet, short life have I felt like this before
Your heart is like a diamond, you throw your pearls at swine
And as I watch you leaving me, you pack my peace of mind
Our love was like the water that splashes on a stone
Our love was like our music, it's here and then it's gone
So take me to the airport and put me on a plane<start>My child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talking 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say, "I'm gonna be like you, dad
You know I'm gonna be like you."
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
"When you coming home, dad?" "I don't know when
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then."
My son turned ten just the other day
He said, "Thanks for the ball, dad; come on, let's play
Can you teach me to throw?"
I said, "Not today, I got a lot to do."
He said, "That's okay."
And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed
And said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him."
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
"When you coming home, dad?" "I don't know when
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then."
Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man, I just had to say
"Son, I'm proud of you. Can you sit for a while?"
He shook his head, and he said with a smile
"What I'd really like, dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later; can I have them please?"
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
"When you coming home, son?" "I don't know when
But we'll get together then, dad
You know we'll have a good time then."
I've long since retired, and my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, "I'd like to see you if you don't mind."
He said, "I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time
You see, my new job's a hassle, and the kid's got the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you, dad
It's been sure nice talking to you."
And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
"When you coming home, son?" "I don't know when
But we'll get together then, dad
We're gonna have a good time then."<start>And though my sermon salts the air
My ears are soon left empty, silence still holds dominion
Words once adorned are now laid bear
Unpolished lumps of nothing, so much unheard opinion
Silence now dill, hush now be still
All is at ease, rest now 'n peace
Come now sleep
So shut my mouth and close my eyes
I've no strength left to patronize
So much to see with eyes wide open
But not a thing worth placing hope in
So hold me now in sweet pretense
If life's not worth the effort at least it keeps my interest
Like fools embracing ignorance
Striving to still ambition, hopes grip is so relentless
Silence now dill, hush now be still
All is at ease, rest now 'n peace
Come now sleep
So shut my mouth and close my eyes
I've no faith left to compromise
There's so much to see with eyes wide open
But not a thing worth placing hope in
Is that the Idea, It all seems like such a rip-off
Am I supposed to act like it's okay?
And take it like a man?
Don't give me that fantasy, I've nothing
But apathy and impotent anger
And not a thing worth placing hope or anticipation
Accept the gentle thought of darkness
And silence and slumber<start>A cool breeze was caressing
The still of the night
A camp fire was burning
And flickering light
Your body swayed
As I played my guitar
I don't know your name
I don't know where you are
Gipsy girl you tantalise me
Dancing in the fireglow
Gipsy girl why did you have to go
Gipsy girl your vision haunts me
Ev'ry minute of the day
Gipsy girl why did you run away
Your dark eyes were sparkling
Reflecting the fire
Your black hair was flowing
I filled with desire
Oh gipsy girl
Where are you, wish I knew
I search ev'rywhere
I dream of holding you
Gipsy girl you tantalise me
Dancing in the fireglow
Gipsy girl why did you have to go
Gipsy girl your vision haunts me
Ev'ry minute of the day
Gipsy girl why did you run away
Gipsy girl why did you leave me
Disappearing as you came
Just a shadow dancing on my brain
Gipsy girl I'm gonna find you
One day soon you'll be right there
Gipsy girl why did you disappear
Gipsy girl you tantalise me
Dancing in the fireglow
Gipsy girl why did you have to go
Gipsy girl your vision haunts me
Ev'ry minute of the day
Gipsy girl why did you run away
Gipsy girl why did you leave me
Disappearing as you came
Just a shadow dancing on my brain
Gipsy girl I'm gonna find you
One day soon you'll be right there
Gipsy girl why did you disappear<start>Rejoice in your naivete boy, cause it's all gone for me
I know we lived on stupid dreams; it was all we had you see
But when the balance totters there's no time for starry eyes
Clear your thoughts to earn the good life and then I'll call you wise
Now in the end I predict that you'll be just like me
'Cause only the foolish or the blind don't want a new t.v.
And you won't want to haunt the thrift stores when you're old and gray
You'd better earn a packet now for all those lonely days
I see the fire in your eyes and I wish you all the best
But if you want to stay in my world put all of the that to rest
There it is, I've said it, now the rest is up to you
Things were great when we were young; now march with me, its through
If you could only see things my way, then you'd know I'm right!
I believe you can hold on and live life in ways you choose
Confusion and my desperation are far too dear to lose
If all of this meant nothing then you've wasted all that time
But I can't un-tattoo my life, and that's the bottom line
I'm not stupid and I know that everyone plays the game
But how far you go on prefab terms is where we're not the same
Don't want to live my life today for when I'm 65
If we all make it that far, dear god I'll be surprised
Anyway the point is this: I too wish you the best
But when I walk down city streets I don't feel like the rest
Don't worry; I won't wave a red flag or march on the city square
Somewhere between revolution and you, you'll find me there
If you could only see things my way, then you'd know I'm right!<start>Heads down, buried in the sand
She's back now, I better wash my hands
She talks like a man gettin' higher than I can
Lovin' me when I'm in a rock band
(Let her go)
She's livin' in shadows
Waits there in the shadows tonight
And sleeps on a bed of nails
(Let her go)
Close the window, it's time to shut the door
Say a prayer now, and get down on the floor
There's a howlin' wind blowin' through my brain
Movin' in slow, just like the hurricane
(Let her go)
She's livin' in shadows
Waits there in the shadows tonight
And sleeps on a bed of nails
Let her go
Oww, let her go
Go, let her go
(Let her go)
She can't fall in love
Her heart cold as ice now
Let her go
She can't cry for love
There's no tears left inside for one to show
(Let her go)
She waits in the shadows tonight
And sleeps on a bed of nails
(Let her go)
She's living in shadows
Waits there in the shadows tonight
And sleeps on a bed of nails
(Let her go)
Yeah, let her go
Go, let her go
(Let her go)
Aah<start>The doors are closed and walls are white
Someone calls but I don't want to talk tonight
Stay away you all want to stay away
I'm going to be all right, all right
Within the arms of slumber, going to leave it all behind, mmm yeah
Comatose gone under, like all the other times
With pride and disdain I'm going to ignore this pain
When someone falls you're supposed to get up again
I try to oblige but I, I can't tonight
I'm going to be all right, all right
Within the arms of slumber, going to leave it all behind, mmm
Comatose gone under, like all the other times, yeah
Comfort of my dreams I resign myself to you
Dream as I might, oh I'm sleeping when I'm blue
Such a pleasure when I feel myself go under
Stay away, stay away while I'm in the arms of slumber
And I'm leaving it all behind
Mmm, going to leave it all behind
The magic of sweet morpheus, you're doing it once again
You saved me from my sadness, you saved me from my pain
Protect me from depression, protect me one more night
And I'll be all right, all right
Within the arms of slumber leaving it all behind, mm
Comatose gone under, like all the other times, yeah
Comfort of my dreams I resign myself to you
Dream as I might, oh I'm sleeping when I'm blue
Such a pleasure when I feel myself go under
Stay away, stay away while I'm in the arms of slumber
Comfort of my dreams I resign myself to you
Dream as I might, well I'm sleeping when I'm blue
Such a pleasure when I feel myself go under
So stay away, stay away while I'm in the arms of slumber
And I'm leaving it all behind, mmmhm
Stay away you all want to stay away
Stay away you all want to stay away
Stay away you all want to stay away
Stay away you all want to stay away<start>Popped the door of the hinges of his closet
Black curtained doorway and into the death room
Took out the ceiling and climbed into the attic
Tied the ropes to the rafter and he snapped into his doom
'Cause Richard hung himself
Richard hung himself
Just the other day they talking Richard hung himself
They said that Richard hung himself
They said too many reasons for him to cease to exist
And not enough reasons for him to want to stay
Looking for an escape, a better way than this
He may have found it or may have lost the way
'Cause Richard hung himself
Richard hung himself
Just the other day they talking Richard hung himself
They said that Richard hung himself
Switch to Pomona behind the cornfield
Around back, underground, where the trees shield
In the corner of the yard, another death room
Where the dead are buried in an unmarked tomb
Stiff blue painted cat wired to the roof
Cyanide in the darkness and dangling goat hooves
Floor covered in dirt, dead grass, and decay
Now Richard joins them and calls it escape
Just the other day they talking Richard hung himself
They said that Richard hung himself
They said that
'Cause Richard hung himself
'Cause Richard hung himself
I know Richard hung himself
'Cause Richard hung himself
'Cause Richard hung himself<start>Washing machine, pinstripe dream stripped the gloss from a beauty queen

Don't worry now
Don't worry how

Would you sing me now to sleep

Stand in line behind me
We've got tons of time to
Let it all hang out
And cast the demons out.
Once we're in the roof falls
I heard that we have got to raise it up
And let the fucker burn.
And this is sure to take awhile
But if we're going out, we're goin' out with style
So we all jump around, and we fall to the ground
Like it's the last rock show of our lives.<start>When the distant charge of love is felt
And the fruit is heavy on the vine
Rivers rushing as the snow it melts
I should take some time
Really make you mine
Happenstance
Such a charmer
Like an extinguished star
You're gone yet still remain
And you've taken it so far
Return to outer space
If I lay me beside you
Your golden hair frozen
Happenstance
Such a charmer
Close your eyes in the dark
And open up a door
You feel the energy arc
You're not here anymore
When the honeyed days of love return
And the king is drunk upon his throne
City's empty and the crystal burnt
I should take some space
Be with you some place
When the hopeless nights of love have gone
And the spirits are still within the trees
And we're running back to Albion
I should take some chance
Given happenstance
Happenstance
Such a charmer<start>It's way past noon, I just woke up
Man, I feel like shit
One drink too much, took me right out, pass
How the hell did I get home
I was still in bed when I heard the door
Somebody kept on knockin'
And there she was, neat as a pin
Smile on the face, staring down on me
There she was, there she was
Asking for the little donation
There she was, there she was
Shakin' more than my foundations
So I asked her in, and to my surprise
She didn't waste no time
She took off her dress, kicked off her shoes
And threw away her glasses
She was here, she said, to save my soul
Asking for a little donation
I gave her all I had to give
Waiting for my salvation
There she was, there she was
Praying for the little donation
On her knees, there she was
Shakin' more than my foundations
There she was
Begging for a little donation
Down on her knees
She rocked me down to my foundations
Dwn to my foundations
It's all for a good purpose
But it ain't for charity
It's all for a good purpose
She came for money, and gave her dignity
C.O.D.- Charity
C.O.D.- Charity, no charge
C.O.D.- Charity, no fees
C.O.D.- Charity
C.O.D.- Charity, she came, she saw, she conquered
C.O.D.- Charity
C.O.D.- Charity, she came, she saw, she had it from me
C.O.D.- Charity
C.O.D.- Charity, down
C.O.D.- Charity, down on me
C.O.D.- Charity, oh Lord
C.O.D.- Charity, she's sucking out the devil, the devil in me
You know, I'm good
Do you like my holy donation
Just call on me, whenever your want
And rock me down to my foundation
There she was
Asking for a little donation
Don't ever stop, don't spill a drop
Keep a shakin' on a my foundations<start>Too depressed to think
A train of empty thoughts
Where's the meaning
Confused and distraught
Behind your dreams
Lies your past

Find peace
Find truth
Find my way
Eternal youth
Not look back
Not give in
Fight the fight
Always win
Dont forget your past
You've arrived at last
Now you can think
TOo many random thoughts
Found the meaning
Confused and distraught
Here lies your dreams upon your lap
Better take them boy hurry fast<start>Wendy Wetlip stares from a poster

Looking the other way
Ronnie the Raincoat hangs out in a book store
He's never seen his own wife in the nude
Somebody called him depraved
But think of the money he saved
Dwarf on a moped speeds through the park
To Killroy's Renaissance the Temple of Art
Signs with a flourish and makes it his own
Pockets his pencil and slyly rides home
Annual cultural African dancers
Bereft Isabella in rubber thigh boots
A man was arrested today
For something he put on display<start>Trouble me, disturb me with all your cares and you worries.
Trouble me on the days when you feel spent.
Why let your shoulders bend underneath this burden when my back is sturdy and strong?
Trouble me.
Speak to me, don't mislead me, the calm I feel means a storm is swelling;
there's no telling where it starts or how it ends.
Speak to me, why are you building this thick brick wall to defend me when your silence is my greatest fear?
Why let your shoulders bend underneath this burden when my back is sturdy and strong?
Speak to me.
Let me have a look inside these eyes while I'm learning.
Please don't hide them just because of tears.
Let me send you off to sleep with a "There, there, now stop your turning and tossing."
Let me know where the hurt is and how to heal.
Spare me? Don't spare me anything troubling.
Trouble me, disturb me with all your cares and you worries.
Speak to me and let our words build a shelter from the storm.
Lastly, let me know what I can mend.
There's more, honestly, than my sweet friend, you can see.
Trust is what I'm offering if you trouble me.<start>-

Strung out on lasers and slash-back blazers
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go, and everything tastes right
Poor little Greenie, ooh-ooh
Keep her comin'
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls (Jean Genie)
Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoah
Sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She love him, she love him but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, ooh-ooh
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls (Jean Genie)
Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoah
He's so simple-minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in a capsule
Loves to be loved, loves to be loved
Oh, Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls (Jean Genie)
Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoah
Go!
Go!
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls (Jean Genie)

She's the kinda trouble I'd like to be in
I wanna be a lover - I wanna be a slave
But she's the kinda women makes me wanna misbehave
So give it what you want boy - let's make it understood
That if ya wanna be bad ya gotta be good
She says there'll be no lying - no foolin' around
No seven day weekends -
No nights on the town
Well that's the way I wast it -
That's the way it's gotta be
If you're looking for trouble better get it from me
So get on your knees boy and do what you should
If ya wanna be bad ya gotta be good<start>Backfired
Your plan, your plan
Backfired
Backfired
My man, your plan
Backfired in your face
You came into my life to test me
Your diplomatic drag depressed me
And even your eyes undressed me
You were poly-slick, really thick
Wasting time, dropping lines
Like I could get you into movies
But we wound up at 'Hoy Joys' for hamburgers to go
Backfired
Your plan
Backfired
Backfired
My man, your plan
Backfired in your face
To steal my mind was your objective
The way you spoke was too aggressive
Your silly jokes were not impressive
Like a travelling salesman
Fondled my three daughters yet
All the creeps were so suggestive
Then we ran down to 'Hoy Joys' for hamburgers to go
Backfired
Your plan
Backfired
Backfired
My man, your plan
Backfired in your face
Oh, come here, my little dear I've got what it takes
Give me just what I want and I'll give you a break
Sounds like your steeping on your lips your lips 'cause you're talking so fast
Buying for first, crying for last
Now come on, little lady, don't shoot me down
I've got strong connections all over the town
Just drop to a dead stop
Backfired
Your plan
Backfired
Backfired
My man, your plan

You were poly-slick, really thick
Wasting time, dropping lines

Alice smiles in chemical glow, "tea's just about ready", she doesn't want to know
The hatter laughs, he's bought the rights
To the t-shirt of the movie of the terminal tonight
So take brittania by the hand and waltz her through this crumbling land
Kiss her apocalypse goodbye
Goodbye
I'll have this last waltz with you, we'll dance until the end
I'll have this last waltz with you, until midnight chimes again
Round and round we go, round and round we go
I'll have this last waltz with you, we'll dance until the end
I'll have this last waltz with you, until midnight chimes again
Round and round we go, round and round and round we go
Waves digest white cliffs of dover, a blindman looks for four-leafed clover
Canute cried an ocean's tears, peter pan - well he's showing all his years
The mortgage he and wendy planned
Down in never, never, never never, never, never never, never land<start>There's so much I want to say now
But it's too late I know
Well there's no way to heal these wounds now
And my heart bleeds for you
And our love is crashing
Like a tidal wave, coming over me
So I wanted you to know that I finally let you go
After all I've held on to, this is my goodbye to you
I was always there for you but you never saw the truth
And the reason that I know is I've finally let you go
I finally let you go
Yesterday you were my best friend
But tomorrow took you away
There's not much for me to say now
Just goodbye, farewell
And our love is crashing
Like a tidal wave, coming over me
So I wanted you to know that I finally let you go
After all I've held on to this is my goodbye to you
I was always there for you but you never saw the truth
And the reason that I know is I've finally let you go
And every time I close my eyes
My heart is bleeding deep inside
But now my eyes are open
And I'm never gonna be the one for you, the one for you
So I wanted you to know that I finally let you go
After all I've held on to this is my goodbye to you
I was always there for you but you never saw the truth
And the reason that I know is I've finally let you go
Finally let you go, finally let you go
Let you go, let you go
So this is my goodbye to you<start>Bound at every limb by my shackles of fear
Sealed with lies through so many tears
Lost from within, pursuing the end
I fight for the chance to be lied to again
You never were strong enough
You you never were good enough
You were never conceived in love
You will not rise above
They'll never see
I'll never be
I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of me
But through my tears breaks a blinding light
Birthing a dawn to this endless night
Arms outstretched, awaiting me
An open embrace upon a bleeding tree
Rest in me and I'll comfort you
I have lived and I died for you
Abide in me and I vow to you
I will never forsake you
They'll never see
I'll never be
I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of me
They'll never see
I'll never be
I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of me<start>Keiner wußte wie's geschah

Böhse Onkelz immer wieder
Keiner wußte wie's geschah
Plötzlich warn wir da
und keiner der uns sah

Böhsen Onkelz kann keiner wiedersteh'n
Böhse Onkelz kann man nicht seh'n
Böhse Onkelz bringen Unheil
Böhse Onkelz bringen den Tod

verderben wir das ganze Land
böse Menschen böse Lieder
Böhse Onkelz immer wieder<start>This campfire won't last forever
The Hip have only wrote so many songs.
And we can sort of harmonize together -
You hold my hand, as you try to hold on.
We can't stay up north for the summer -
Head back to the city and find a job.
I know my family loves you like their daughter
But I know you feel like I strung you along
At a time you were kissing me,
The camera found chemistry; cheering for us in cheap seats.
Driving home I can see you stare at me differently.
We're stuck in the nosebleeds baby.
True love never needed luxury.
Our love never needed any pretty scenery.
We embraced the summer heat,
And those walks that took forever through suburban streets.
If you want to leave me
True love is always complicated.
Your friends never liked me much at all.
There'd be times that I'd come home crying,
She never knew it was always my fault.<start>Hey now, baby, you're rolling
And your kitty in the middle is calling
You got me hot like a diamond at Christmas
Oh, my Lord
Meet me on a corner at midnight
We'll get down 'cause you know that it's alright
You keep my rocket like you need the sunlight
Oh, my Lord
Oh, my Lord
You are hotter than a firestorm
You will never have to be alone
You'll be treated like a precious stone
Girl, you've got some dedication
I wanna give you all of my affection
You got all the boys at your attention
Oh, my Lord
Oh, my Lord
You are hotter than a firestorm
You will never have to be alone
You'll be treated like a precious stone
Oh, my Lord
I have never seen this before
You must have been blessed when you were born
Wanna wrap you up and take you home
Baby, you're the main attraction
I wanna give you some satisfaction
I hear you knocking at my backdoor
Oh, my Lord
Oh, my Lord
You are hotter than a firestorm
You will never have to be alone
You'll be treated like a precious stone
Oh, my Lord
I have never seen this before
You must have been blessed when you were born
On my knees praying, oh, my Lord<start>Latimer
After words
and long goodbyes...
Tears and lies
at the end of the day.
An early night
and madness rains...
The moon pulls your dreams
and the pressure fades.
And now,
the final encore,
a last farewall.
The fantazy is over,
the spirit flies away...<start>Jesus is on the main line, tell him what you want
Jesus is on the main line, tell him what you want
Jesus is on the main line, tell him what you want
Call him up and tell him what you want
Yeah, he will come in a hurry, just tell him what you want
I said, he will come in a hurry, just tell him what you want
Oh he will come in a hurry, just tell him what you want
Oh, call him up and tell him what you want
Jesus is on the main line, tell him what you want
Jesus is on the main line, tell him what you want
Jesus is on the main line, just tell him what you want
Oh, call him up and tell him what you want
If you're sick and you can't get well, just tell him what you want
If you're sick and you can't get well, just tell him what you want
Yeah, if you're sick and you can't get well, tell him what you want
Call him up and tell him what you want<start>Aww yeah!
I'm off an' runnin'
Clear off the beaten path
I don't know where I'm goin'
But I know that I ain't comin' back
Don't know where I'm goin'
But I can't wait to get there
Sometimes I laugh to win
Cause he who laughs lasts
I see the headlights burnin'
Casts a magic spell
Will I make that turn?
An' only time will tell
Time after time I'm walkin' the line
Between trouble an' my Lady Luck
I can't deny that woman is mine, all right
Lady Luck
She said
Don't sing me ballads
Life's a game for me
She liked to ride 'em cowboy
So don't throw that book at me
And ride 'em cowboy that we did
More than most could stand
Pass the buck an' live it up
Then she found another man
Who can race me child?
Who can tell it well?
Who can take me, baby?
Only time will tell!
Time after time I'm walkin' the line
Between trouble an' my Lady Luck
I can't deny that woman is mine, all right
Lady Luck, yeah!
Ooh, baby
Owall right
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
Woh, yeah, Lady of mine, yeah
Mine all right
Hear the light'nin', whoa yeah
And fear the thunder, whoa yeah
Aww right!
I'm hot!!
Wow!
Now baby please, babyPlease!
Lady luck, I tried to please tho'
I seen your behind, aw yeah
All right
Baby please
Trouble ahead, Trouble behind
Never leave me Lady Luck
Trouble ahead, Trouble behind
Lady Luck
Whoa, all right<start>Please find your place
The room grows scarce
Once were all inside
The service can begin
For a moment, if you please
Forget what you believe
And naked, you will see
That we are all the same
But how, your kiss
Your words, your lips
Your flesh, your bones
Exactly what you need
Why should I feel intrusion?
Why be afraid of what we do not understand?
To eliminate exclusion
Cut out the differences to feel like we belong
Drum beats louder
Open up your head
Open up you primitive
Open up your mouth
Open up your head
Your sweet primitive
Open up your mouth
It's coming out
Out there, no food or drink
How many days do you think youd last
On your diamonds and your pearls?
Im not a king, no, not a hero, not a fool
I'm not perfect, I'm flesh and bone
And I'm exactly what you need
Drum beats louder
Open up your head
Open up you primitive
Open up your mouth
Open up your head
Your sweet primitive
Open up your mouth
It's coming out
Open up your head
Scream, you sweet primitive
Tell me what you said
But how, your kiss
Your words, your lips
Not a gun to your head
You're gonna die before you're dead
Not sad, when you're gone
But when your lights still on
Your wingswont let you fly
Don't be dead before you die
Hunger, till fed, give love instead
When it gets inside, watch the dead man squirm
Above all things
If kindness is your king
Then heaven will be yours before you reach your end<start>Everywhere you looked there was confusion, violence, drama and drugs
So many righteous revolutionaries spouting Utopian love
Everyone shrouded in purple haze
Then one day they woke up from their dream state
They found themselves no more at peace than before
Older, meek, and conformed
Empty causes
A bluster for the soul, a fix for their mind
Empty causes
Cling to everything you find
Well, the shots rang out like popcorn
And the Chief was hit and rushed out of sight
The Mohawk-chain, leather brigade rejoiced maliciously on that night
Someone cried out "fuck the government"
His mates couldn't define what he meant
So no one gave him the time of day
And the scene died away
Empty causes
A war for the body, an army in the mind
Empty causes
Losing steam as time goes by
Could it be that everybody selfishly desires their own personal retinue
And that causes are just manifestations
Of too much time and far to little to do
Empty causes
Direction for the soul, conviction for the mind
Empty causes
Cling to everything you find
Empty causes
You've got yours and I've got mine<start>Living like a stone in a river,
All alone, peaceful at the bottom,
While the rest fight not to drown,
Sitting while the current of the stream passes me by,
Forget about the fighting and the flow as I empty my mind
Living like a fossil,
Still from the torrent of time in a broken world,
Still a stone at the end of the line
My trajectory is so true they float away and I don't move
Crooked head pulling at the end of a rope, waiting for a sign
Swimming through the flood, so afraid because there is so little time.
Always running, always searching, always making it a race,
So detached like a leaf, never fixed to life in one place,
Getting lost in the shuffle makes you feel so small.
Fight against the swell just to throw yourself at the wall,
They're all dogs, fighting over the bone.
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna leave it alone
Crooked head<start>We're gonna go
What ya gonna do
We're goin' out tonight
Runnin' through the streets like hooligans
We can see the morning lights
Kickin' down the door
To every corridor
We're gonna clear a path
Better get out of the way
'Cause we're comin' through fast
We have got to fight
To keep this party goin' all night
100 beers in me that is the plan<start>When the lights go up and the game is on
Are you ready for me
Cause I'm ready for you
When the bell rings out and the fight is on
Are you ready for me
Cause I'm ready for you
When the lights go up and the game is on
Are you ready for me
Cause I'm ready for you
When the bell rings out and the fight is on
Are you ready for me
Cause I'm ready for you
It's time for us to start throwing down
Take a look and see who's standing now
It's time for us to start throwing down
Look and see who's standing now
Didn't even know that you and I were cross
Until a sneak attack on the weak side
Unaware that we were in a fight
I guess that's part of the problem
But guess what
When the lights go up and the game is on
Are you ready for me
Cause I'm ready for you
When the bell rings out and the fight is on
Are you ready for me
Cause I'm ready for you
It's time for us to start throwing down
Just look and see who's standing now
It's time for us to start throwing down
Look and see who's standing now
Say what you want about me
Throw up what you want to throw up at me
But when you mess with those are around me
That's when you and I will have a problem
When the lights go up and the game is on
Are you ready for me
Cause I'm ready for you
When the bell rings out and the fight is on
Are you ready for me
Cause I'm ready for you
It's time for us to start throwing down
Just look and see who's standing now
It's time for us to start throwing down
Look and see who's standing now
I'm not afraid of loving my enemies
Turning the other cheek
Blessing those that would curse me
I honestly want peace with you
But when you come against my country
When you come against my family
You try to destroy my people
I can't just stand by
There's no way that I can stand by
This time I will not stand by
I am coming, and if I come
Then pain is coming with me
Now I'm coming and pain will be with me
When the bell rings out, this fight is on
Are you ready for me
Cause I'm ready for you
It's time for us to start throwing down
Just look and see who's standing now
It's time for us to start throwing down
Wow, look and see who's standing now
Look and see who's standing now
Look and see who's standing now
Look and see who's standing now<start>Cheers to the day I'm on my way
I'm living inside with the words you say
It's killing me
How you're always bringing me down
So put to rest this breath that i can't forget
These marks just left on the side of his neck
Its killing me now
You're always bringing me down
You never learn to expect the worst
It always takes just the slightest little turn
To open up your eyes
And though it seems like we'll grow to change
You'll never learn cause you'll always be the same
Predictable inside
The way you are
It's not your fault you knew that
The way we were
So young and caught up in it
Too far to see how things can be
I thought I knew who you were
You never learn to expect the worst
You're falling short of every line that you've rehearsed
It's opened up my eyes
And now you'll see that we've grown to change
A contradiction to the lives that we have made
Still I miss you deep inside
The way you are
It's not your fault you knew that
The way we were
So young and caught up in it
Too far to see how things can be
I thought I knew who you were
Just close your eyes and dream of how you want your life to be
now getaway, don't run away from all that you can see
Just trust that you'll be strong and just let your life move on
The way you are
It's not your fault you knew that
The way we were
So young and caught up in it
Too far to see how things can be
I thought I knew who you were
The way you are
It's not your fault you knew that
The way we were
We're just so caught up in it
Too far to see how things can be
I thought I knew who you were
I thought I knew who you were
I thought I knew who you were<start>I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees.
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees.
Asked the Lord above for mercy, "Save me if you please."
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride.
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride.
Nobody seemed to know me, everybody passed me by.
I'm going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side.
I'm going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side.
You can still barrel house, baby, on the riverside.
You can run, you can run, tell my friend-boy Willie Brown.
You can run, you can run, tell my friend-boy Willie Brown.
And I'm standing at the crossroads, believe I'm sinking down.<start>Keep your things in a place meant to hide
But I know they're there somewhere
And I know that's where you'll go tonight
I'll be thrown over just like before
The white lady loves you more
Need a metal man just to pick up your feet
It's a long time since you cared enough for me to even be discrete
I know what this metal is for
The white lady loves you more
I'm looking at a hand full of broken plans
And I'm tired of playing it down
You just want her to do anything for you
There ain't nothing that you won't allow
You wake up in the middle of the night
From a dream you won't remember flashing on like a cop's light
You say she's waiting and I know what for<start>I need you to hold me
I need you to help me
I needed all those things and more
But I look out a window
I saw the sun setting
Things don't make sense anymore
If only we could find the time
Find the perfect place
But I'm shaking
In the shade
If we could find the time
If we could find the place
I'd like to see your face
Moving away from the spotlight
We don't have to make no sense
We don't have to get it right
It's not what we give away
It's what we keep inside
But now I'm not so certain
I've lost all my ambition
And all the drive I had before
I need you to hold me
I need you to help me
I needed all those things and more
If only we could find the time
Find the perfect place
But I'm shaking / in the shade
If we could find the time
If we could find the place
I'd like to see your face
Moving away from the spotlight
We don't have to make no sense
We don't have to get it right
It's not what we give away
But what we keep inside<start>Scream, shout
Scream, shout
We are the fallen angels
We are the in between cast down as sons of war
Struck to the earth like lightning on this world we're torn
We will cause the pain of living out there, love
Take joy in who you are
We know how wings are flown
We're bored to death in heaven and down alone in hell
We only want to be ourselves
We scream, we shout
We are the fallen angels
We scream, we shout, whoa whoa
Too lost to see the road
No need to feel this sorrow
We scream, we shout, whoa
We are the fallen angels
Follow the morning star
On a land when darkness failed
The passion left unholy
Now you found yourself
We have nowhere to go, no one to wish us well
A cry to find a home, our stories they will tell
We're bored to death in heavens and down the alone in hell
We only want to be ourselves
We scream, we shout
We are the fallen angels
We scream, we shout, whoa whoa
Too lost to see the road
No need to feel this sorrow
We scream, we shout, whoa
We are the fallen angels
Scream, shout
We are the fallen angels
Scream, shout
We scream, we shout
We are the fallen angels
We scream, we shout, whoa whoa
Too lost to see the road
No need to feel this sorrow
We scream, we shout, whoa
We are the fallen angels
We scream, we shout
We are the fallen angels
We scream, we shout
Whoa, whoa
We shout
We are the fallen angels<start>Eve is gone again
Back to her palace, back to her island
Eve can smile again
And run round the hedges in the Garden of Eden
Run the way you did before the nightmares
Run just like before the overkill
Run the way you did it's over darling
Oh, could I be so gentle
Oh, so soft and tender
Oh and could I forgive
And could I die in my mother's arms like her
Eve's a child again
Sing her a lullaby
Read to her every night
Eve's in heaven
Plenty of friends are there
No one the enemy
Run the way you did
Before the nightmares
Run just like before the
Overkill
Run the way you did it's
Over darling
Oh, could I be so gentle
Oh, so soft and tender
Oh and could I forgive
And could I die in my mother's
Arms like her
Like her
Run the way you did
Before the nightmares
Like her
Run just like before the
Overkill
Like her
Run the way you did it's
Over darling
Like her
Run the way you did
Before the nightmares
Like her
Run just like before the
Overkill
Like her
Run the way you did it's
Over darling
Could I die in my mother's
Arms like her<start>We'll come home when the battle's over
We'll come home with clothes all drenched in blood
This is the life we chose
This is how the story goes
For those who fight in the 3rd world war
It's us against the world today
You know, could go on forever
(Forever)
Pollute our minds with what they say
You gotta run alone but I know it ain't so
(Ain't so)
We can have it our own way
But we gotta learn to work together
(Together)
I see them capitalizing on other peoples woes
I see them on the streets and everywhere I go
We'll come home when the battle's over
We'll come home with clothes all drenched in blood
This is the life we chose
This is how the story goes
For those who fight in the 3rd world war
You try to understand everything we say
You try to analyze everything we do
Ask me what it is that we're fighting for
It's for freedom that we fight the 3rd world war
Living in the world today
I see that things could be much better
(Better)
But I'm never gonna give up
Not gonna lay my head down, no never
(Never)
You live your life for just one day
The faceless never remembered
(Remembered)
I see them capitalizing on other people's woes
I see them on the streets and everywhere I go
We'll come home when the battle's over
We'll come home with clothes all drenched in blood
This is the life we chose
This is how the story goes
For those who fight in the 3rd world war<start>If you wonder why I always look so bad and even when I smile I still look sad
Well it's just because I've lost the only love I've ever had
Now I'm livin' in tumble down shack on shabby little street on the hill in Lonelyville
If you think I'm livin' pretty well it's true
But there's nothing else that's left for me to do
She packed my clothes showed me the door and then she said we're through
Now I'm livin' in tumble down shack on shabby little street on the hill in Lonelyville
Well Lonelyville is not a happy place but now I'm forced to live here in disgrace
I heard her slammed the door behind me tight and I realized I didn't treat her right
So I'll have to face the sadness and the sorrow every night
In my tumble down shack on shabby little street on the hill in Lonelyville
In my tumble down shack on shabby little street on the hill in Lonelyville<start>I heard the sound of your bike
As your wheels hit the gravel
And your engine in the driveway, cutting off
I pushed through the screen door
And I stood out on the porch
Thinking fight, fight, fight, at all costs
But instead I let you in
Just like I've always done
I sat you down and offered you a beer
And across the kitchen table
I fired several rounds
But you were still sitting there when the smoke cleared
You came crawling back to say
That you want to make good in the end
Oh, let me count the ways that I abhore you
You were never a good lay
And you never were a good friend
But oh, what can I say, I adore you
All I need is my leather
One t-shirt and two socks
I'll keep my hands warm in your pockets
And you can use the engine blocks
We'll ride out to California
With my arms around your chest
And I'll pretend this is real
'cause this is what I like best
You've been juggling two women
Like a stupid circus clown
Telling us both we are the one
And maybe you can keep me
From ever being happy
But you're not going to stop me
From having fun
So let's go, before I change my mind
I'll leave the luggage of all your lies behind
'cause I am bigger than everything that came before
You were never very kind
And you let me way down every time
But oh, what can I say, I adore you<start>We're taught unconditional love,
That blood is thicker than water,
That a parent's world would revolve,
Always around their son or their daughter.
You pretend I was your own,
And even believed that you loved me.
But were always threatened by some
Invisible blood line that only you could see.
You took advantage of an outreached hand
And twisted it to meet your every need
"Gimme time to recharge my batteries,
I'll see her when she's older
And I'll bounce her on my knee"
Well listen to me you ungrateful fool,
Here comes a dose of reality.
You'll go to your grave a sad and lonely man,
The door is now closed on your
Pathetic little plan.
On and on and on and on it goes,
It's so easy to run away with
Nothing in tow.
How can you ever sleep a wink at night,
Pretending that everything is alright,
And have the nerve to blame this mess on me?
Never in my life have I seen someone
So Ignorant to the damage he has done.
You're the rotted root in the family tree.
I tried your 4 bill therapy,
I tried to make amends.
But nothing could lure you out of your
Selfish shell again.
Expecting everyone
To bow and kiss your feet.
Don't you see respect is not a
One way street?
Blaming everyone,
For all that you've done wrong.
I'll get my peace of mind when you
Hear this song.
On and on and on and on it goes,
And with every passing day
True colors show.
How can you ever sleep a wink at night,
Pretending that everything is alright,
And have the balls to blame this mess on me?
Never in my life have I seen someone
Oblivious to the damage he has done,
You're the rotted root in the family tree.
Watch where you walk,
Don't you dare cross the crooked step.
Watch the way you talk,
Don't cross the crooked step.
On and on and on and on it goes.
Chauvinistic, heartless, selfish,
Cold.
How can you ever sleep a wink at night,
Pretending that everything is alright,
And have the balls to blame this shit on me?
Never in my life have I seen someone
So fucking blind to the damage he has done,
You're the rotted root in the family tree<start>Vacancy, room to let any dumb ideas in to this empty head
"Gospel, man!"
Don't quote me please,
It was the first thing I thought but now it's been said
And you'll lead the conversations that lie ahead
Whit the empty phrases by which you're led
Do you know what I heard the other night?
Guess what so, and so said to me
The majority of ears were only being polite
Couldn't be bothered to disagree
A social distance set
By a liking of something hard to forget
A need to remember and recognize
And inspiration that over-rides
Any hesitation or compromise
Not relying on dubious facts in disguise
What you eagerly collect
And subsequently resurrect
From acquaintances and T.V. set
Falls on distant ears
But when you tell it like it is
From your own ideas and what they give
We're all involved in the way you live
And the distance disappears<start>The backlash has started, but we ain't fucking laughing, take a look at how
much has changed, there ain't mush to smile about. We've done four years of
begging and a lot longer struggling, well ain't it about time, we took back
what is ours.
Punk formed as a movemnet to set right what was wrong: the opposing side said
No. we're right, you're wrong. They controlled our bands with money and they
all sucked off our sweat, well that's the fucking lesson we never must forget.
The time moved on and rebellion Just seemed to be a bore, as one by one the
leaders collapsed, the money bought the whore, time and time again we heard
new promises were made, but words was all it was, the action was delayed.
They tried to salvage something, but the mistake already done, with C.B.S. and
E.M.I. backing what went on. Those tears upon the stage, we heard they all
came from the heart and if we all stood together, it would just be the start.
Well the start just never happened, as our hopes ran down the drain, now
take a good look, you'll see it's happening again, the punk movement once
strong, once offering real change, is searching fame and fortune, and that
just ain't the fucking way.
Punk is still our movement, we can put tight what is wrong by learning to say
No, we're right, you're wrong, fuck their fucking future it means oppression
war and hate its time to turn the tables around and recreate the state.<start>Instrumental<start>You never did care
Never dared to say what I disliked about you
What I hated about you so now
I'm breaking all we had in two
Time and time again I did what you said
Should have left me for dead and I refuse to do it anymore
There's nothing left in this heart for you
But I'm really feelin' like the sunshine is shinin' right down on my face
And I'm runnin' with the best of them oh of the change
Whoa I'm lovin' but I'm feelin' like shit and I'd never leave you for that
Never leave you dyin' alone
Even now with my hatred for you and everything that you put us through
I would never leave you all alone
How could you leave me lyin' like that when I'm fallin' away
You leave me lyin' when you know that these are my dyin' days
Oh and everything we laughed about
Can't think about none of that
It's just the past I'll forget about something we let pass by
So much to do here but none of it's for you
Sometimes I look on the inside and I swallow my pride
Could things have been easier somehow
Doesn't really matter now there's nothing in this heart left for you
Whoa I'm lovin' but I'm feelin' like shit and I'd never leave you for that
Never leave you dyin' alone
Even now with my hatred for you and everytihng that you put us through
Still I'd never leave you all alone
How could you leave me lyin' like that when I'm fallin' away
You leave me lyin' when you know that these are my dyin' days
Oh I'm fallin' away
These are my dyin' days
All I needed to say-I have all but fallen away<start>Eyes, boring a way to me
Paralyze, controlling completely
Now there is a fire in me
A fire that burns
This fire is out of control
I'm gonna burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm gonna burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
Im gonna burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm gonna burn it, I'll burn it, I'll, I'll, I'll burn it down
Eyes, burning a way through me
Overwhelm, destroying so sweetly
Now there is a fire in me
A fire that burns
This fire is out of control
I'm gonna burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm gonna burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm gonna burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
And I'm, I'm out of control and I burn
Oh, how I burn for you
Burn, oh, how I burn for you
Burn, how I burn
How I burn, oh, how I
This fire is out of control
I'm gonna burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm gonna burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm gonna burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm gonna burn it, I'll burn it, I'll, I'll, I'll burn it down<start>I am on your side
You light me up inside
You fill my eyes with stars
It doesn't get me very far
Just look around
You don't need no fairy tale to get you by
Just look around
You don't need no Santa Claus
You don't need to make things up
But if there's something more than this
I'll meet you sucked inside a kiss
And if there's something more to this
Then I will be the catalyst
I wish I could say something beautiful to
Make you fall in love again
But love has slowly faded away like
Spotlights shining in to space
I am on your side
You light me up inside
You fill my eyes with stars
It doesn't get us very far
Just look around
You don't need no fairy tale to get you by
Just look around
You don't need no Santa Claus
You don't need to make things up
But if there's something more than this
I'll meet you sucked inside a kiss
And if there's something more to this
Then I will be the catalyst
I wish I could say something beautiful to
Make you fall in love again
But love has slowly faded away like
Spotlights shining in, spotlights shining in to space
Just look around
You don't need no government to get you by
Just look around
You don't need no Santa Claus
You don't need to make things up
But if there's something more than this
I'll meet you sucked inside a kiss
And if there's something more to this
Then I will be the catalyst
I wish I could say something beautiful to
Make you fall in love again
But love has slowly faded away like
Spotlights shining in, spotlights shining in to space<start>Alone again.
You're breaking point is near.
Lay down your head on your pillow
Stain with tears from the past year.
Wouldn't you know it's because of him?
You can't let go.
It's a dead end.
You've done all that you can.
Given up your friends.
Your support left unmanned.
By His command.
I've only know you for a short time.
But, here's my advice.<start>When you know that i know that you think you like me

because of me your smile seems just to never end oh yeah
oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah<start>All the pieces fall into place
When we walk these fields
And I reach out to touch your face
This earthly heaven is enough for me
So break the bread and pour the wine
I need no blessings but I'm counting mine
Life is much more than money buys
When I see the faith in my children's eyes
I've felt the power in a holy place
And wished for comfort when in need
Now I'm here in a state of grace
This earthly heaven is enough for me
So break the bread and pour the wine
I need no blessings but I'm counting mine
Life is much more than money buys
When I see the faith in my children's eyes<start>You beat up Fearl's bass player
You were all surfers last year
3 years ago it wasn't cool
You spit on me, but I'm no one
Eh, bobby pin had long hair
But you spit on darby crash
He had a fucking mohawk man
3 years ago
Forming in 1975
I'm a new waver
My girlfriend's a surfer
She's more cool than you are
And she's not going to fuck you anyways
Eh, it dosen't matter, you all suck
You don't know shit about punk rock
You're just a bunch of drug addicts
Screwing up what we call FUN
I hate everything, that means you
I hate you more than I do
I got no time to sleep, time to get laid
I got a 2"x 2", but it dosen't matter
Fake hard core
You spit on URINALS<start>You know you're everything to me
And I could never see, the two of us apart
And you know I give myself to you
And no matter what you do, I promise you my heart
1-I've built my world around you and I want you to know
I need you, like I've never needed anyone before
2-I live my life for you
I want to be by your side in everything that you do
And if there's only one thing you can believe is true
I live my life for you
I dedicated my life to you
You know that I would die for you
But our love would last forever
And I will always be with you
And there is nothing we can't do
As long as we're together
I just can't live without you, and I want you to know
I need you like I've never needed anyone before
(repeat 2, 1)
Wow, yeah I live my life for you<start>I told you that some day
If you kept on being untrue
Somebody else would come along
And release me from you
You'll be glad to know now
Your fickle world
Can have its own way
For it finally happened
I've met her today
I used to think I just couldn't live
A day without you
In spite of the thousand doubts and tears
That you put me through
All at once I don't care as much for you
I'm sorry to say
For now there's another
I met her today
How I treasured each smile, each kiss
You gave to me now and then
Well, you needn't be kind to me now
Oh no, not ever again<start>Surely it's a waste of time
You hold me highly, I suppose it's fine
I feel worthy 'cause I've gained your trust
I've done it for myself
I have eaten on a cold dead horse
I have wandered down a blind man's course
I have promised everything will be fine
I don't say this to no one else
If I fail, if I rise, will you trail behind?
If I fail, if I rise, will you trail behind?
Got home pretty late last night
Where's that scratch from, did you get in a fight?
I have told you over, over again
You should stand up for yourself
Scared it was about your size
Look, don't worry, I can see it in your eyes
Strength in numbers is the chef fireman
Don't say this to no one else
Anyway you look at this
There's nothing you could do
Calm yourself and evade yourself
Remember I'm with you
If I fail, if I rise, will you trail behind?
If I fail, if I rise, will you trail behind?
If you want to follow
Don't leave the light on
Don't leave the light on with her
Don't leave the light on<start>Eternidad
La pasin es premio a la eternidad, tenacidad, valor.
El control es bsico, primordial, para alcanzar y alzar
Las banderas de una nueva nacin, con lealtad, verdad.
Romper las caretas hipcritas, es la misin por realizar.
Cmo saber bien cul es la verdad, cuando da igual mentir
En un mundo lleno de falsedad y corrupcin, sin paz.
La dominacin smbolo fatal, para vendar, tapar
Nuestras mentes amplias de libertad, sin traicionar jams.
Corre, corre....
Corre, corre, cada vez ms fuerte y elvate al cielo.
Vuelo supremo del poder.
Elvate al cielo, ests preparado? Ya!<start>Yo, Nori know this and Nori know that
Yo but Nori know gat, why
'Cause Nori buck dat
Iraq'll make you famous
Throwing gang signs like it's sign language
Distinguish us from the others
Kidnap your baby, mothers
Bringing drama to the deep covers
Salute G, bust you down like a Lucie
Jose probably lay with a gold Uzi
Crunk Italy, Africa and Sicily
Niggaz acting sissy see
Pointing guns and missing me
Yo son, it's on son
Hey, yo, there's beef in the hood again
Niggaz came with hoods again
Thinking that it woulda been
Saw us from what we first did
When we did
Now we twist another wig, a mother lose another kid
But it's beef now, keep it short
Real brief now
Strike vigorous, no intentions of missing it
They sent the message or example, whatever
Set it up, man on man
Only to score we apply the plan
Quickly explain why you ran in this dark land
We lay you down in the sand
On the lines like the Internet
Many would come if you would pose off
Against my set, there ain't a nigga yet
Smoke so much, niggaz say I need nicarette
You say bogie but you used to say cigarette
Nine-oh, a new religion, a new beginning
I'm leaving
Baby, don't go
I know the block is hot
Boo, I'll watch your spot
I'm leaving, sweetie don't leave
I need you to stay with me, come on
Uh huh, uh, uh, uh huh, uh, uh
I'm leaving
Boo, I can't understand
And don't think that I'll be back again
It's like a bad dream and I can't wake up, mouth caked up
Knowing these cats is fake fucks and it ain't right
With no love, them hugs ain't tight
Son we used to pop bottles and slugs the same night
Hey, yo, they left me
Right hand damaged and I ain't lefty
Couldn't bust when I's supposed to pull
What I'm supposed to do?
Lay down, watch these niggaz
Spray me or maybe
We strike accurate
Blaze them plus they ladies
I woulda never thought we'd ever get caught in this way of life
Prosecution, if you violate a player's rights, say it twice
Nature soon to be engraved in ice
Hanging off my neck, glistens like it's framed in light
Niggaz call me Jose, shootin the Artie Clay
Benedict Arnold type, getting this rap loot
Still selling China White, either Allah or Christ
Married to marijuana, now my niggaz don't write
(Still ice, still living this life)
I'm leaving
Baby, don't go
I know the block is hot
Boo, I'll watch your spot
I'm leaving, sweetie don't leave
I need you to stay with me, come on
Uh huh, uh, uh, uh huh, uh, uh
I'm leaving
Boo, I can't understand
And don't think that I'll be back again
You got the nerve to say that Nature's slipping?
The greatest vision, bald-head kid
Cartier frames, the latest Pippens
Doggystyle was my favorite position
Until I switched it, dead shit, got on some head shit
Headed in the wrong direction up in the Sheraton
QB to LA, still puffing my medicine
For those lost in the streets up north or deceased
For those struggling, unfortunate to eat
I dedicate this, tell me right now how do you rate this?
Whatever happened to the mule and the 40 acres
It's outrageous, the way the God finesse the basics
Invasion, me and Noreaga Firm made men<start>The leaves of brown came tumbling down
Remember, in September, in the rain
The sun went out just like a dying ember
That September in the rain
To every word of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to play a sweet refrain
Though spring is here, to me it's still September
That September in the rain
To every word of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to play our sweet refrain
Though spring is here, to me it is still September
That September in the rain<start>I want to be a boss
I want to be a big boss

I want to do it right away
I want to do it right now
I want to do it right away
I want to do it now
Don't want to be a dancer in the Bolshoi Ballet
Don't want to work for daddy
In daddy's shop, 0K
I get confused, so confused
I get a pain, I get a pain up here in the Shirley Temples
What you gonna do
How you gonna do it
What you gonna do
How you gonna do it
Little by little, ooh
Little by little, bit by bit
Sssh, not too loud, don't tell everybody
Don't give away the game
Oh, I ain't quite ready to reveal my campaign
This is not the time
My hero's are alive and well in a cave
I'm keeping them on ice in suspended animation
Till the very right occasion comes along
To our rally come along
Come along to our rally
Come along to our rally come along
To our rally come along
Come along to our rally
Come along to our rally come along
A Brave new world will rise from the ashes
And there upon a rock titanic
I'll cast a giant shadow on the face of the deep
And never again will they dare to call me
A freckled, spotty, specky, four eyed, weedy, little creep
No more tremblin' and quakin' in the gym
No more come on fellas, let's get him

Bit by bit, bit by bit
Everyone's going to be free
But they'll have to agree to be free
They'll have to agree to be less free than me
'Cause I rule the world you see
So wait for the army of kiddy-winkies
And terrible tiny tots
In armored school buses
Firing poison pea-shooters
And sinking their milk teeth into your thighs
Delapsus resurgam when I fall I shall rise
I want to be a boss
I want to be a big boss
I want to boss the world around
I want to be the biggest boss
That ever bossed the world around<start>In the beginning God made the land
Then He made the water and creatures, then He made man
He was born with a passion, love and hate
A restless spirit with a need for a mate
But there was something that was missing, something lost
So he came with the answer, here's what it cost
One part love, one part wild
One part lady, one part child
I give you
(Women, women) lots of pretty women
(Men, men) they can't live without them
(Women, women) lots of pretty women
(Men, men) they can't live without them
And in the garden, lust began
The animal instinct, the wanton man
She fed him with a hunger, an appetite
And fillin' with emotion he took a bite
It was one part love, one part child
One part lover, one part wild
I give you
(Women, women) lots of pretty women
(Men, men) they can't live without them
(Women, women) lots of pretty women
(Men, men) they can't live without them
Skin on skin, let the love begin
Women
It was one part love, one part wild
One part lover, one part child
A whole lotta fire, a little bit of ice
A whole lotta something you can't sacrifice
I give you
Hair, eyes, skin on skin
Legs, (legs) thighs, (thighs) what's that spell? (what's that spell?_

She's going to break your heart in two, it's true
It's not hard to realize
Just look into her false colored eyes
She builds you up to just put you down, what a clown
[Chorus:]
'Cause everybody knows
(She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please
(She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease
(She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks
You're put down in her book
You're number 37, have a look
She's going to smile to make you frown, what a clown
Little boy, she's from the street
Before you start, you're already beat
She's gonna play you for a fool, yes it's true
[Chorus]<start>She's got everything a man could ever ask for
She is lovely, brighter than a morning star
She is so beautiful, portrait of a sunset
She got everything, including my old car
Next time you see her, tell her that I love her
Next time you see her, tell her that I care
Next time you see her, tell her that I love her
Next time I see you, boy you'd better beware
I'm just trying to warn you that you're bound to get hurt
I couldn't be her last love, so how could you be her first?
I want to tell you, buddy, things are bound to get rough
I know that she's only flirting, but I think that I've had enough
Next time you see her, tell her that I love her
Next time you see her, tell her that I care
Next time you see her, tell her that I love her
Next time I see you, boy you'd better beware
And if you see her again, I will surely kill you
And if you see her again, I will surely kill you
Next time you see her, tell her that I love her
Next time you see her, tell her that I care
Next time you see her, tell her that I love her
Next time I see you, boy you'd better beware
And if you see her again, I will surely kill you
And if you see her again, I will surely kill you
Next time you see her, tell her that I love her
Next time you see her, tell her that I care
Next time you see her, tell her that I love her
Next time I see you, boy you'd better beware<start>There's no one in this world for me
There's never gonna be
There's no one in this world needs me
There's never gonna be
Yet sometimes in my dreams I hear
Sundown
I miss you, sundown
I need you, sundown
Come on, come on, come on, come on, back to me
Come on, come on, come on, come on, back to me
I need you, sundown
I need you, sundown
There's no hands ever reached for me
There's never gonna be
There's no one meant for lonely me
There's never gonna be

You washed
Didn't even notice
That I followed
Please, you better some love
Please, you better send it
Right away, yeah, yeah<start>Augie Nieto's got a story to tell you
Though it's hard to hear him speak
He caught Lou Gehrig rounding third one day
Now he's happy as he'll ever be
He's running through the night
He'll die before he sleeps
Augie's found what I've been looking for
Augie Nieto can tell you he loves you
He's two wheels close to God
His captain Lynn sailing by his side
He'll never leave you lost
Though his arms can't squeeze you tight
He'll hold you when you sleep
Augie's found what I've been looking for
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Take it any way it goes
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Open up your never mind
Open up your mind
Augie Nieto has never been happier
You got to see to believe
He caught Lou Gehrig rounding third one day
Now he's carrying the whole team
It's not the breaths you take
It's how to breathe
Augie's found what I've been looking for
Augie's found what I've been looking for<start>Here is the one here is the one here is the one mistake that can not be made
There is a line that is crossed over once and only once let it be said
All of the hubris clenched in our fist won't punch our way out of here
You know what I've told and I tell but you won't let it pass into your ears
Even the oxen ramming their heads on wood rails
Come to know pain before the rusted barrier falls
Before the radio long before radio waves struck down to touch
Off the wild flame that took all in it's path and trampled the young underbrush
Music shooed clouds away billowing anxieties are rolled over and out
Seems like a lot of folks gave up and got out except for the truly devout
Who like the oxen ramming their heads on wood rails
Came to be dizzy before the barrier fell
Love is the one love is the one weapon that hasn't been brandished yet in this song
Strikes fear in the pockets of bankers and generals without it we can't carry on
And all of us knew this at one time from teething to toothless it's safe to say
But useless perhaps to point out that we've lost our instincts and awe in this day
And like the oxen ramming their heads on tin walls
Might come to know mercy before the barrier falls
And I come to know mercy before the barrier falls
And I come to know mercy before the barrier falls
Falls falls
And it falls falls falls
And it falls falls falls<start>It was abrupt
I remember the day clearly
Dropped my head,
Walked until nothing I knew was near me
Forged ahead/ to make a new way
Looking to fill a void, no reason to stay
Been here a while,
waiting my heart's mending
To reflect, a life that
I've come to regret/ and yet
What I thought wasn't right is the love that I
Never thought would be mine
Unresolved,
left some loose ends behind me
Thought I knew,
some things I just accepted blindly
Need to go back, miss what we had
Marking our days ahead, so many plans
I've come to find,
made a mistake in leaving
You alone,
please show me a way to return back home
Where my heart confides and my secrets lie
Revealed in your eyes
Where can I find you to stand beside you?
Wonder how that would be
And if when I call you fail to answer
What's to become of me?
How do I get back to you?
Which road would lead to the truth?
Show me how to get back to you
Show me how to get back to you
Show me how to get back to you
Tell me what I need to do (anticipating)
Gotta find my way
I just wanna come home
I've been gone too long
I just wanna come home
Where can I find you to stand beside you?
Wonder how that would be
And if when I call you fail to answer
What's to become of me?
How do I get back to you?
Which road would lead to the truth?
Show me how to get back to you
Show me how to get back to you
Show me how to get back to you
Tell me what I need to do
Gotta find my way
I just wanna come home
I've been gone too long
I just wanna come home<start>Every now and then, get the feeling, you let me win
I don't want it that way, like a child, let me play
I don't know what I want, don't know what I'm feeling inside
Would you take sometime, wrap me up, let's go for a ride
Got a bad thing longing, baby
And it's growing stronger each day
Got a bad thing longing, honey
So bad, they'll put me away
Don't you ever tell me I'm not the one
I'll come undone, I'll come undone
Every once in a while, get the feeling you've lost your smile
Hope it's not my fault, all my faces are canned and bought
I don't know what I want, don't know what I'm feeling inside
Could you spend the night, wrap me up, let's go for a ride
Got a bad thing longing, baby
And it's growing stronger each day
Got a bad thing longing, honey
So bad, they'll put me away
Don't you ever tell me I'm not the one
I'll come undone, I'll come undone
I'll come undone, I'll come undone
I know you can't understand all the things I do
But I'm tired of explaining the things I put you through
I don't know what I want, don't know what I'm feeling inside
Would you turn out the light, wrap me up, let's go for a ride
Got a bad thing longing, baby
And it's growing stronger each day
Got a bad thing longing, honey
So bad, they'll put me away
So bad, they'll put me away
So bad, they'll put me away
Don't you ever tell me I'm not the one
I'll come undone, I'll come undone
I'll come undone, I'll come undone<start>No one needs to know how I feel
No one needs to understand
Because they can't have a hold on us
It's not just any kind of love
I know when something is too sacred to touch
[Chorus:]
They don't see you're right where I want you
And I think you could be something that's more than expected
Why let this go all the way down from here?
I'm here
We both tend to run when we're hurting
We both tend not to forgive and forget
The past can't have a hold on us
For you my heart will give its trust
I'll dote as much of you
Just need your love
They don't see you're right where I want you
And I think you could be something that's more than expected
Why let this go all the way down from here?
I'm..
Here you go again
Doubting yourself
For no good reason
You're listening to someone else
[Chorus]<start>You oughta be a little more careful baby
You know I'm dangerous
With my wild imagination
You'd better stop right now
Yeah you better
Oh, it's too late
That pink cotton candy, the sound of your voice
Completely destroys me
I've got no choice
Yeah, I'm coming apart at the seams
Feeling you pulling my strings
Waking me up with a dream
That's so real
With passionate desperate
Passionate desperate
Passionate desperate love
You're holding me closer than a whisper baby
Mmm secretly I love the way you drive me crazy
want to feel, gotta feel
Your hands cooling my skin
I'm caught in the flames of my desire
Your pour on your kisses
Baby, that's fire
Yeah, I'm coming apart at the seams
Feeling you pulling my strings
Waking me up with a dream
That's so real
With passionate desperate
Passionate desperate love
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I know I'm making a scene
But don't wake me up from this dream
I finally know what it means
To feel
Yeah, I'm coming apart at the seams
Feeling you pulling my strings
Waking me up with a dream
That's so real
With passionate desperate
Passionate desperate
Passionate desperate love

i want to be among the dead tonite
i want to stumble through a moonless nite
i want to see my flesh go through decay
i wouldnt have it any other way
i think i knew you
once when my viens flowed blood
but now I'd rather
go sleep in the mud
i want to be among the dead tonite
i want to stumble through the moonless nite
i want to see my flesh go through decay
i wouldnt have it any other way....oh yeah
among the dead tonite.

And mail it to you
Ill try to live the memories
Remind me of you
Moments of decision
Keep haunting me now
Pictures just like photographs
Head hangs so low
One man couldnt write these words
One man could never make himself heard
One heart like a big drum beating so loud
One man with a loaded gun locked in his soul
If I dont remember
To post out these words
I hope you can forgive me
Every time that I try
Sounds are like echoes
Going round in my head
Things that Id forgotten
Hidden meanings that are dead
One man couldnt write these words
One man could never make himself heard
One heart like a big drum beating so loud
One man with a loaded gun aimed at his head
(Instrumental)
One man couldnt write these words
One man could never make himself heard
One heart like a big drum beating so loud
One man with a loaded gun aimed at his head
Aimed at his head
One man - one man - one man
One man - one man - one man
Oh oh one man couldnt write these words
One man could never make himself heard
One heart like a big drum beating so loud
One man with a loaded gun aimed at his head
One man one man one man<start>This moon was a planet just like the earth, only it is even deader.
The pistols of its flowers are the only protection against insetcs,
which were more preoccupied with the half rotted inhabitants soiled to the brim undet their own garments.
History tells us of their blood flowing down one leg and up the other.
Memories insoluble to their conscience, memories,
outside themselves in a twisted prank played upon them by dogs tired of chasing their food.
Thin oxygen curves their posture substantially.
Flashes of their purpose stripped to skeletal ornaments of meat
and resin from animal marks flciker over the loudscreen.
Machines hum quietly in the distance.
A few naive inhanbitants wander foolishly after sundown in search of black spots,
but no one leaves this moon carefree of memory.
Survivors often match their hands upward towards greater satellites,
wronged in the eyes by a million miles and a million more bodies to sift through.
The smaller creatures have the secret to pinning us down to the dirt:
When they breathe, they inspire, when we breathe, we expire.<start>I made up my mind
You know when you're sick of tryin'
You've gotta be on your way
I was always denying
The things that I felt inside
I really don't wanna stay
This is all my brand new life
You wake up one day
And realise you're wastin' time
You know there's a better way
I know if you try
You'll get it to go your way
Jump and you just might fly
This is all my brand new life
You never really wanted it so bad
So take the time to do it right I know that
Its really hard but you will be so glad
So take the time to do it right before its over
You wake up one day
And realize you're wastin' time
You know there's a better way
This is all my brand new life<start>I hate the steam train that whistles woozy my bird brain,
That sends my spaniel insane.
And I'll stop riding side saddle if they don't stop the clickity clattle,
I'll jump in the undertow penguin paddle and drown in my wedding gown.
I've been told the Bronx River stream on moonlit nights is meant
To seem like the Rhone in a glacier icy dream but then in a poof t's sulfur steam.
I hate the aeroplane that nearly misses my birdie brain,
That terrifies my terrier insane.
And I'll stop riding side saddle if they don't stop the clickity clattle,
I'll jump in the undertow penguin paddle and drown in my wedding gown.
I was drinking by the Des Plaines River when the naught of night
Served for making me shiver and me the squirrels would hold hands
And quiver cause that damnable diesel never fails to deliver.
I hate the livery cars that have my bird brain seeing stars,
That drive my Doberman to drink in bars.
And I'll stop riding side saddle if they don't stop the clickity clattle,
I'll jump in the undertow penguin paddle and drown in my wedding gown.
I hate the steam train that whistles woozy my bird brain,
That sends my spaniel insane.
And I'll stop riding side saddle if they don't stop the clickity clattle,
I'll jump in the undertow penguin paddle and drown in my dressing gown.<start>I didn't ask, they shouldn't have told me
At first I laughed but now
It's sinking in fast, whatever they sold me
But baby
I don't want to take advice from fools
I'll just figure everything is cool
Til I hear it from you
It gets hard, when memory's faded
And who gets what the say
It's likely they're, just jealous and jaded
Or maybe
I don't want to take advice from fools
I'll just figure everything is cool
Til I hear it from you
Til I hear it from you
I can't let it get me off
Break up my train of thought
As far as I know nothing's wrong
Until I hear it from you
Still thinking about not living without it
Outside looking in, till we're talking about
Not stepping around it
Maybe
I don't want to take advice from fools
I'll just figure everything is cool
Til I hear it from you
Til I hear it from you<start>She's writing she's writing she's writing a novel
She's writing she's weaving conceiving a plot
It quickens it thickens you can't put it down now
It takes you it shakes you it makes you lose your thought
But you're caught in your own glory
You are believing your own stories
Writing your own headlines
Ignoring your own deadlines
But now you've gotta' write them all again.
You think she's an open book
But you don't know which page to turn to
Do you
You think she's an open book
But you don't know which page to turn to
Do you [Repeat: x2]
You want her, confront her, just open your window
Unbolt it, unlock it, unfasten your latch
You want it, confront it, just open your window
All you really have to do is ask
But you're caught in your own glory
You are believing your own stories
Timing your contractions
Inventing small contraptions
That will roll across your parlor's hardwood floors

You think she's an open book
But you don't know which page to turn to
Do you

Everyone in every hour
All is me, is all I need and that's all that I care
Propelled through all this madness
By your beauty and my sadness
I'll never change or rearrange
'Till I've finished what I've started
And life leads me here
It shows me, I have never really loved no one but me
Like the time, you slipped through my hands
I'll never understand
Why I'm such a selfish man
Walk around me not before me
I'll pretend not to ignore ye
But I'll compromise if I realize you can do something for me
I'm ugly and you know it
But you think that I'm a poet
So I'll keep the rhyme if I feel in time
It gets me where I'm going
And life leads me here
It shows me, I have never really loved no one but me
Like the time, you slipped through my hands
And I'll never understand
No, I'll never understand
Why I'm such a selfish man
All I heard was an unearthly silence
Apart from the violence, explode in my head
Where all at once was this moment of beauty
No more since it slew me, no never again, again, again
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
No, I'll never understand
No, I'll never understand
Why I'm such a selfish man
Selfish man, selfish man, selfish man, selfish man, selfish man<start>I saw time turn so much there to unlearn,
You were envy you wouldn't say you tore heart strings
That sorry day dark light hid the tears one for each of the years
Love has reasons reason never knows
Time turns over love overflows I should have spoken sooner
On that sorry day your arms are open
And I wondered why
Wondered why
Five years passed to the day time heals some people say
When you hurt the ones I love you're also hurting me
And time turns over turning you from me I thought you'd never reach me
On that sorry day your arms were open wide and I wondered why<start>(How can we know Love when we were never shown it?)
Little Richie was the runt of the litter, given a thick hide by father and brothers
Identified more with his sisters and mother, always felt a bit different from the others
A loving marriage from the outside, but oh, how ferociously he'd hit her
Richie stood by the bleach white bedside
Ma held his face in her hands while he cried:
"Hush, now, precious lamb, everything will be alright
I know how it looks but I swear he's a good man
Oh baby, G-d has a much bigger plan
I have my family, I have my health, and I'm quite content with that."
"How can you say this time that it'll be alright?
How can you still look in his eyes and see the love of your life?"
(He works all things for good! In the end, it is Love that wins!)
Love was his inclination
Belief, his dearest passion
A beautiful escape from resentment, fear of the next crushing blow
(How can we know Love when were never shown it?)
He'd wait on his lonesome for that blue hair in her station wagon
Attending those Baptist services alone, in the house of the Lord, he found purpose and a home
Richie stood on a chair, peeked over the pulpit, reminded himself and the beloved, not lacking in youthful wit:
"This is what's promised: He works all things for good! In the end, it's Love that wins!"
How are we to know how to Love when every attempt is met with the back of a hand?
It would only be Love to mend the damned, who never grew to know compassion
Just another unfortunate, beaten senseless by his old man
"How can you say this time that it will be alright?
How can you still look in his eyes and see the love of your life?"
(He works all things for good! In the end, it's Love that wins!)

By all means I'm getting mad
That don't mean I don't feel sorry for you

I wish I could stick around
To see your face when you realize
You've permanently changed
And it's all thanks to me

You'll wake alone and run around your lonely home
Look for my face, but I'm already gone
You, you never call
You never write me or nothing

I was stupid, then, to try
There was something in the way
Something in the way
Something in the way that you shut the door

By all means I'm getting mad
That don't mean I don't feel sorry for you
How sad you're gonna be

You've permanently changed

Look for my face, but I'm already gone
One day you're going to see
The life sentence you gave to me
But I swear one day we will share this cell
I know it's cold but I will keep us warm
With all the hate I radiate
We'll be walking hand in hand in hell
How sad you're gonna be

Slowly turned in to a scream.
Searching for an answer
Where the question is unseen.
I don't know where you came from
And I don't know where you've gone.
Old friends become old strangers
Between darkness and the dawn
Amen omen,will I see your face again?
Amen omen,can I find the place within
To live my life without you?
I still hear you saying
"All of life is chance,
And is sweetest,is sweetest when at a glance"
But I live,
I live a hundred lifetimes in a day.
But I die a little
In every breath I take.
Amen omen,will I see your face again?
Amen omen,can I find the place within
To live my life without you?
I listen to a whisper,
Slowly drift away.
Silence is the loudest,
Parting word you never say.
I put I put your world
Into my veins
Now a voiceless sympathy
Is all that remains.
Amen omen,will I see your face again?
Amen omen,can I find the place within
To live my life without you?
Amen omen, will I see your face again?
Amen omen, can I see your face again?
Amen omen, can I find the strength to live my life

Crush my heart with Desmond Dekker
Little itty bitty of Freddy Fender
Start me up return to sender

baila que se marchen las maÃ±anas
hacia el mes de abril.
Dia de San Juan la madrugada,
a los 4 vientos de zarpada,
que bien te sienta asi.
Bailaras (bailara), saltaras esa hoguera que aparece
en tus ojos encendidos por un rito asi
Dale que toma, toma que dale
todos los acertijos son iguales,
pero este no es asi.
Martes y 13, 14-F tocan los tambores en la calle
Noviembre no es asi.

Bailara (bailara) saltaras esa hoguera que aparece
en tus ojos encendidos por un rito asi.
Bailaras saltaras esa hoguera que aparece
en tus ojos encendidos por ritos asi.
Dale que toma, toma que dale,
ya viene el vieto fresco de la tarde,
ya hueles en ti,
Que dia es hoy que dia es maÃ±ana te respondere con un abrazo,
por otro rito asi.<start>My momma talkin' to me tryin' to tell me how to live
But I don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve
My daddy, he disowned me 'cause I wear my sister's clothes
He caught me in the bathroom with a pair of pantyhose
My basketball coach, he done kicked me off the team
For wearin' high heel sneakers and actin' like a queen
The world's comin' to an end, I don't even care
As long as I can have a limo and my orange hair
And it don't bother me if people think I'm funny
'Cause I'm a big rock star and I'm makin' lots of money
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Ahh, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
I'm so bloody rich ha ha ha ha
I own apartment buildings and shopping centers ha ha ha ha
And I only know three chords ha ha ha ha<start>the candy looks so good to me

I was parched and dry from the cold
I've been travelin' four days and nights, sir
And I do want to thank you for the ride, sir
And the soup your wife made tasted fine
If it's all the same
I'll be on my way at the next turn
And I'm free marched out in my town
And my baby is waitin', I hope, sir
After fifteen trucks and an old Ford
And the Government madness, I ran away

It's filled with worn out places
Forgotten faces
And nothing changes
Whatever happened
To that new day rising
We're just surviving
And living is dying
Are you tired
Of being let down
Another day
Another shakedown
I'm with you
We hope is gone
All you want is the truth
(I'm with you)
You carry on
when it seems no use
I'm with you
I'm with you
If I got one thing
I got something to prove
We all got nothing
If there's nothing to lose
(I'm with you)
I walk in shadows
That seem all familiar
I've read the papers
A life forsaken
A mumble some from
I'm one more for sale sign
Down on Main street
You just walk by
How many times you gotta
Break down
Before somebody's
Gonna shout out
I'm with you
We hope is gone
All you want is the truth
(I'm with you)
You carry on
When it seems no use
I'm with you
If I got one thing
I got something to prove
We all got nothing
If there's nothing to lose
(I'm with you)
When hope is gone
And all you want is the truth
(I'm with you)
You carry on
When it seems no use
It seems no use, It seems no use
When I got one thing
I got something to prove
We all got nothing
If there's nothing to lose

From a thousand yesterdays
I read it in this ancient book
When the old man passed away
I drifted through the pages
And its magic filled my eyes
I dreamed she once loved me
In the land called Trinidad
I ride the wind
Sail the water
She calls my name
To come on back to her in
Trinidad
Trinidad
The silence on the ocean
Like the silence in my heart
She still sings to me softly
Through the night and in the dark
I ride the wind
Sail the water
She calls my name
To come on back to her in
Trinidad
Take me back
Take me back
Take me back
Trinidad
She waits by her window
And she shines a light for me
To help me through the harbor
In the land called Trinidad
I ride the wind
Sail the water
She calls my name
To come on back to her in
Trinidad
To Trinidad (Trinidad)
Take me back
Take me back
Take me back, now
(Take me back)
Trinidad (Trinidad)
Come on home to hold me
(Come on home)
Trinidad
Trinidad
Take me back
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Trinidad
Take me back
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh<start>The day you came my way
I was such a fool to say
All the things I said about you just to make you jealous
But I've learnt my lesson then
Now I'm prepared to start again
If I promise to be true
Can I go with you
Whenever you're around
All the boys I know are found
Trying to be the one to hold you by the hand
But I feel if it's O.K.
Only one thing I can say
If I promise to be true
Can I go with you
Can I take you by the hand
Can I love you
Please tell me
Please tell me
Can I go with you
If you think I'm a fool
Let me tell you there's no rule
That can stop me wanting you
And I do, so help me
I won't feel like having fun
'Til you say that I'm the one
So if I promise to be true
Can I go with you
If I promise to be true
Can I go with you<start>Don't listen to their politics or employ their bullshit laws
You never ask why
Don't get caught up in the civil war which your rulers hope to cause
Don't listen to these bastards, don't listen to their lies
Take your fucking race war and shove it up your ass
It's fucking propaganda dispensed by the ruling class
Don't listen to these bastards, don't listen to their lies
In spite of everything you know, You're still playing their game
When you support these fucking bastards the results remain the same
The starving are still hungry
The suffering in pain
The poor still have no money
While the rich drink their champagne<start>Well I'm, I'm Mr. Lonely
I'm Mr. Caught up in between
Well you, my only sunshine
My good and bad times
It isn't fair
Yeah, I'm in love
And I'm at war
Inside my head I'm
Just not quite sure
I'm not quite sure yet
Is this the one?
That I've been waiting for all my life
Could this be the one?
That I've been lookin for all my life
Could this be the one?
Black smoke pours out your lips
And I breathe it in
I breathe you in
My beautiful girl,
My beautiful sin
Who's gonna win your heart I've gotta know
I need to know, yeah
Is this the one?
That I've been waiting for all my life
Could this be the one?
That I've been lookin for all my life
Could this be the one?
That I've been waiting for, yeah
I'm, I'm Mr. Lonely
I'm Mr. Caught up in between
Is this the one?
That I've been waiting for all my life
Could this be the one?
That I've been lookin for all my life
Could this be the one?
Could you be the one?
Could I be the one for all my life? Yeah...
Oh, yeah
Could this be the one?<start>Well it's 10 pm and all the ladies are looking fine
I'd rather trade off my old steel guitar
just to taste her sweet red wine.
Cause I'm a rusty boy with a nasty toy
that would be my heart,
Just a few shots of that Yukon Jack
You might be my sweet push start.
CHORUS
It's just another hopeful night
for a hopeless guy.
It's just another hopeful night
for a hopeless guy.
Well I stepped out on that dance floor
I smelled honey in the air
When I spotted that queen of diamonds
with her ultraviolet stare
I said hey easy come easy go it's my latest groove,
but it don't make things much easier when some are born to lose.
CHORUS
Well I sat down at my buddy's table
and I bought another round
They say it's better off to go and loosen up
before you run and get shut down.
So I made my move across that room
to my sweet little sugar pie
I winked and I asked her for a dance
She said I could make you fly.
She said my boyfriend's here and
it really would be nice,
but he doesn't want me dancing with you hopeless guys.
CHORUS
Well I grabbed her hand and I kissed her cheek
Man I sure did fly, but it was out across
that dance floor with her boyfriend and two black eyes.
It was an easy come but a tougher go
but I guess that's nothing new
as that sexy waitress iced my head
someone tell me this is true.
I'm getting really sick and tired
of this hopeless fight,
I'm just another hopeless guy on a lucky night.<start>The house where you still live
Walk on by
The place where we would kiss
And the room where I held you tight
Tonight I must walk on by
Walk on by
The room where you still sleep
Walk on by
The company that you keep
And the room where I held you tight
Tonight I must walk on by
Somehow I know whoa
I won't forget you no no no no no, I won't
You won't forget me no no no no no, you won't
I'll keep on walking away from here
I'll forget you when I reach the other side
Walk on by
The house where you still live
Walk on by
The place where we would kiss
And the room where I held you tight
Tonight I must walk on by<start>When they gave out eyes like diamonds
That would shame the stars that shine
My darlin' my darlin'
You were the first in line
When they gave out lips like honey
That hold a new thrill every time
My darlin' my darlin'
You were the first in line
There may be others
that know you longer
Who pledge their hearts to you
But there's no other
could love you stronger
Any stronger than I do
Don't refuse me, say you'll choose me
My darlin' say I'm your darlin'
The first, and the last in line.<start>Dusty day dawning
Three hours late
Open the curtains
And let the rest wait.
My mind goes running
Three thousand miles east
I may miss the harvest
But I won't miss the feast.
And it looks like you're gonna
Have to see me again
And it looks like you're gonna
Have to see me again
And it looks like you're gonna
Have to see me again.
Illinois, oh, Illinois.
South California
Your sun is too cold
It looks like your hills
Have been raped of their gold.
I should have come out
When I was first told
This lamb has got to
Return to the fold.
And it looks like you're gonna
Have to see me again
And it looks like you're gonna
Have to see me again
And it looks like you're gonna
Have to see me again.
Illinois, oh, Illinois.
Illinois, I'm your boy.
Flat on the prairies
Soil and stone
Stretching forever
Taking me home
'Cause I've got a woman
Who waits for me there
And I need a breath of that
Sweet country air.
And it looks like you're gonna
Have to see me again
And it looks like you're gonna
Have to see me again
And it looks like you're gonna
Have to see me again.
Illinois, oh, Illinois.
Illinois, I'm your boy.<start>Upon a roof below the moon
Nearby a park-bench in the sun
Upon the stairway to your room
Why won't you wrap your life around
Those certain words I just found
I wear your golden ring inside
Suits me very fine
I wear your golden heart in mine
Suits me very fine
A backseat sofa in the dark
Upon a viewpoint in our town
Nearby a fountain in a park
Why won't you wrap your life around
Those certain words I just found
I wear your golden ring inside
Suits me very fine
I wear your golden heart in mine
Suits me very fine
I wear your golden heart in mine
And life is very fine<start>In my rooom
I'm alone in my room
And I'll be in for a while
And can't you see
I'm holier when i'm....
I'm feeling good enough to try?
All the drugs that you bring
If they're antiquated beyond belief,
Might good enough to get me high.
Am i
Am i
My only only only friend that
I am, i?
Am i
Am i
My only only only friend that
I am, i?
In my gloom
I'm only in my doom,
And I'll be in for a while.
I used to think,
While I sit and wait for the phone to ring
That I'd be happier if I just am.
Only, only, only, only,
Only, only, omly, only,
Only, only, only friend that
I am, i.<start>you say it's not a how
but rather it's a why
if you think you've got the answers
then get up and try
if my belief comes with an empty hand
don't call me a sinner
even though I am
don't waste your time
my mind is set
don't hit me up tomorrow
cause I won't forget
let's talk of the things
that we concur on
and move along to something else
I'm sitting in the corner
got my face against the wall
I can't be sold on what I'm told
I'm too scared to fall
don't disregard me if I don't buy your brand of bread
I cant help it if I don't find strength in what you've said
don't waste your time
my mind is set
don't hit me up tomorrow
cause I won't forget
let's talk of the things that we concur on
and move along to something else

well that's all nice and fine
understand me when I say
that I'm satisfied with mine
I know you want to help me
but I'll be fine on my own
now I'm going out to dinner
if I have to all alone
don't waste your time
my mind is set
don't hit me up tomorrow
cause I won't forget
let's talk of the things that we concur on
and move along to something else<start>The most important thing
Is listening the recording of the music
It makes them gain a, um, musical sense
And uh, gets to the point of the fast progress
And also, every day, every lesson
We have to make sure they learn about tonalization<start>This is the day that I
Figure out the rest of my life
Who do I want to be?
Will I ever get to be somebody?
Apart from you
A part of you
Always gets carried around
So get all dressed down
And go and hit the town
Funny how it always works out
You're not the only
One who is lonely
Everyone knows
We're different speeds
With light years between
And yet it goes
On and on
So we joke around again
Could we ever really be friends?
I'll always say I want you and
Secretly mean it
We could talk about it
But I doubt it
Would make any difference now
It would take forever
For us to stay together
Funny how it never works out
You're not the only
One who is lonely
Everyone knows
We're different speeds
With light years between
And yet it goes
So let me go
Don't let it go
On and on
It's hard to know if this is for the best
But I guess we'll find out in time
All you've ever wanted lies ahead
You're not the only
One who is lonely
Everyone knows
We're different speeds
With light years between
And yet it goes
So let me go
Don't let it go
On and on<start>Think of your fellow man, lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see, it's getting late, oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see
Another day goes by, and still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know, we won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see. Wait and see<start>We are difficult to understand
It was hard to make the simple plan work
Difficult, that's what made it burn
You're a satellite
Around my heart
One million miles before the start
Indescribable, that's what makes it you
Shivers up and down my spine
Feet to the deep
Inside this big, bright world
Inside this big, bright world
Inside this big, bright world
You rage against the dying
Rage against the dying light
You're mysterious, you make no sense
I love you 'cause you're innocent
You fell out through a hole inside the sun
So magnify the best inside me
Fill the parts that you can't find me
The parts that won't give out when things get hard
Shivers up and down my spine
Feet to the deep
Inside this big, bright world
Inside this big, bright world
Inside this big, bright world
Round and round in the setting sun
Round and round in the setting sun
Round and round in the setting sun
Round and round round and round and round
Inside this big, bright world
Inside this big, bright world
Inside this big, bright world
Rage against the dying
Rage against the dying light

I'm with you<start>She broke down, on a highway
Miles from nowhere, it had no number
She was lost, a long way from home
She was fed up with the routine
She got trouble with her man
She blew town with a vengeance

Who am I, who are you
I was only passing through

A strange encounter to be sure
He was wicked he was pure
Hear him calling, he's calling for you
Come with me into the mystic
Come with me into the night
We can live, live forever
Painted desert, peyote rain
Lord, don't let me go insane
Skinwalker, skinwalker
Through your eyes I can see
you have left your mark on me
Skinwalker, skinwalker
Painted desert, peyote rain

Talk to the wind

This beach head road

But tomorrow's back for more
Don't let the days go by, no more

But I'm lost just name the shore
Just name the shore
The melted chest

When all I had to say
Came flooding her way

Can't let the days go by, once more
Days gone by
Days gone by
Days gone by
It's where I am, so here I go
Rehearse and first

What good is a speech
When at the beach?
Can't walk or talk or stand

Give it all, give it all
Give it all, give it all
Do it, do it, all right
Do it, do it, all right
Got ideas to supply
And a passport to try
Everything we should but don't
Everything we could but won't
Got out backs to the pack
And no plans to take back
Anything we've ever owned
Anything we've ever known
And what happens next
Will be yours now
'Cause we've gotta figure out
If we're gonna show you how
Do it, do it, all right
Do it, do it, all right
We have the right combination
We got everything
And to strike faster than lightning
We raise what we bring
We have the right combination
It ain't time to crawl
Give it all, give it all
Give it all, give it all
Do it, do it, all right
Do it, do it, all right
Got ideas to supply
And a passport to try
Everything we should but don't
Everything we could but won't
Got out backs to the pack
And no plans to take back
Anything we've ever owned
Anything we've ever known
And what happens next
Will be yours now
'Cause we've gotta figure out
If we're gonna show you how
Do it, do it, all right
Do it, do it, all right
Do it, do it, all right
Do it, do it, all right<start>So you showed me around your town
To hell again and back
Our love has served to alienate
All the friends you depend on
I know it might seem odd
I know it might seem odd
Cause your not the only one
I remember my self as a lonely child
So I was
And you've got me wrong
You've got me wrong
(Ground your sense of worth
Til the spark of morning burns
And all those searching eyes
Could scold your tender mind)
Remember what they say
There's no shortcut to a dream
It's all blood and sweat
And life is what you manage in between
But what you don't know
Is you're too young and eager to love
Seething eyes
So you're about to get into
The ditch that you opened up
(Ground your sense of worth
Til the spark of morning burns
And all those searching eyes
Could scold your tender mind)
So the stars aligned
And leave you behind
You wanna sow it up
Here come the light
Of an autumn moon
Sister you know enough
But for now just let it go
Don't run, don't rush
Just flow
Through the give and take you had to learn
How to cross the coals and not get burned
But you're really just a little girl
Playing in the park until the sun goes down
Sometime you want to rise
One did it's our desire
No doubt you think you braided your own hair
So you're all grown up
Should you want to cross the line
Which way do you want to fly?
Pretend that love could help you find your way
But you got me wrong
Yeah you got me wrong<start>The sheik he drove his cadillac
Shareef
Rockin the casbah
Rock
He thinks it's not kosher
Fundamentally he can't take it
You know he really hates it
Really, really hates it<start>There's a room at the end of the world
Where my secrets go to hide
There's a room at the end of the world
Where I'll wait for you tonight
Where the roads all go to end
Where lost Valentines get sent
Where a rose comes back to life
Where young love never dies
Where we never say goodbye
Don't say no, just give in
Close your eyes, there's no sin
Don't hold back, just let go
Take your time, take it slow
It's me and you in our room at the end of the world
There's a room at the end of the world
Where your memories are safe
There's a room at the end of the world
Just gotta have some faith
Where all prayers go to be heard and the truth will have its turn
Take a look into these eyes, there's no place I'd rather be tonight
No place I'd rather be tonight
Don't say no, just give in
Close your eyes, there's no sin
Don't hold back, just let go
Take your time, take it slow
It's me and you in our room at the end of the world
There's no looking back in our room
Fade to black
There's a room at the end of the world
That I hang on to
There's a room at the end of the world
Where I wait for you, I'll wait for you
Don't say no, just give in
Close your eyes, there's no sin
Don't hold back, just let go
Take your time, take it slow
It's me and you in our room at the end of the world
Where I wait for you, in our room
Dreams are coming true, in our room
It's just me and you, in our room<start>Saw my reflection in the mirror, didn't recognize myself
I felt more distant and more useless than the dust upon the shelf
I tried to fix it but I only ended up hurting someone else
Oh lover can you hear me, I'm so scared and I need a little help
I've built so many bridges, then I sat and watched them burn
I had so many chances, never took the time to learn
If I could change the past, go back erase what I had done
I'd redo everything, youth is wasted on the young
Yeah, you gotta crawl before you walk
Sometimes you gotta scream before you talk
You can't take back everything you've done
Youth is wasted on the young
Youth is wasted on the young
Even the thought of me without you sends a shiver down my spine
I'd spend a lifetime on my knees for just the chance to keep you mine
And like a rocket I shot up and then I crashed and burned
I put the pieces back together as the seasons turned
If I could change the past, go back erase what I had done
Redo most everything, youth is wasted on the young
Yeah, you gotta crawl before you walk
Sometimes you gotta scream before you talk
You can't take back everything you've done
Youth is wasted on the young
Youth is wasted on the young
Wasted on the young
Youth is wasted on the young
Wasted on the young
Yeah, you gotta crawl before you walk
Sometimes you gotta scream before you talk
You can't take back everything you've done
Youth is wasted on the young
Youth is wasted on the young<start>There's wars and insurrection
Trouble comes in all directions
Hair loss and indigestion
You only pump after you pay
You know all I've gotta say
Is...
[Chorus]
Come on, dance with your hands above your head
Take a toke, and float that keg
Let me hear everybody holler
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Call the craziest friends you can find
Get your supercallafragalistic freak on
Let your uptight ass unwind
Party like
It might be your last good time
Nobody knows when it comes or fades
Numbers up when the dam break
Yesterday is a day too late
You gotta make your tail feather
Shake, shake, shake
We got the here
We got the now
We got the whammy bar guitar
Goin' wow, wow, wow, wow
[Chorus]
Your last good time
[Chorus]
Your last good time<start>I like coffee, I like tea
I like you baby next to me
You're as cool as red hot lava
Jumpin' east of Java
Cream and sugar sure tastes sweet
But baby, you got all that beat
You're that chick with the swingin' feet
Jumpin' east of Java
It takes a lot of coffee beans
Just to make a single cup
You got me perculatin'
Let's hit that place where the cats all meet
East of China, past Bourbon street
We'll be as cool as red hot lava
Jumpin' east of Java<start>Bled the line tonight
fading as the lies lay weeping on the page
nothing was saved
falling at the sight
photographs of white bright grin and sunny days
and all was betrayed
and i think i know
the reason that your light would never stay
and all thats left to show
are memories now but i can truly say
i was king for a day
and i think i know
the reason that your light would never stay
and all thats left to show
are memories now but i can truly say
i was king for a day
chorus<start>Just give me the warm power of the sun
Give me the steady flow of a waterfall
Give me the spirit of living things as they return to clay.
Just give me the restless power of the wind
Give me the comforting glow of a wood fire
But please take all of your atomic poison power away.
Everybody needs some power I'm told
To shield them from the darkness and the cold
Some may see a way to take control when it's bought and sold.
I know that lives are at stake
Yours and mine and our descendants in time.
There's so much to gain, so much to lose
Everyone of us has to choose.
Just give me the warm power of the sun
Give me the steady flow of a waterfall
Give me the spirit of living things as they return to clay.
Just give me the restless power of the wind
Give me the comforting glow of a wood fire
But please take all of your atomic poison power away.
Just give me the warm power of the sun
Give me the steady flow of a waterfall
Give me the spirit of living things as they return to clay.
Just give me the restless power of the wind
Give me the comforting glow of a wood fire
But please take all of your atomic poison power away.
Won't you do this for me?
Take all of your atomic poison power
Take all of your atomic poison power
Take all of your atomic poison power
Away.
Note: The original has a second stanza which Crosby & Nash omitted in concert. It appears below.
We are only now beginning to see
How delicate the balance of nature can be
The limits of her ways have been defined
and we've crossed that line.
Some don't even care or know that we'll pay
But we have seen the face of death in our day.
There's so little time to change our ways
If only we together can say<start>Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Feel when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd
I can drive down the road, my eyes don't see
Though my mind wants to cry out loud
I, I, I, I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd
I can drive down the road, my eyes don't see
Though my mind wants to cry out loud
Though my mind wants to cry out loud
Dance floor is like the sea
Ceiling is the sky
You're the sun and as you shine on me
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
I, I, I, I<start>I've spent my whole life surrounded
and I've spent my whole life alone
I wonder why I never wonder why
The easiest things are so hard
I just want, I just want love
I just want, I just want love
I just want, I just want love
I just want something
Something for nothing
Something, something for nothing
I'm a beggar and I'm a chooser
I'm accused, I'm an accuser
But nothing's unconditional
I hold the whole world accused
I've only got myself to blame
I wonder why, I never wonder why
The easiest things are so hard
I just want, I just want love
I just want, I just want love
I just want, I just want love
I just want something
Something for nothing
Something, something for nothing
I just want, I just want love
I just want, I just want love
I just want, I just want love
I just want something
Something for nothing
Something, something for nothing
I'm a beggar and I'm a chooser
I'm accused, I'm an accuser
But nothing's unconditional<start>What's the point of standing
Ten feet tall if you never learn to fall
If you want to win you've got to play the game
But if you lose you must accept the pain
So don't reach for the sky if
All you want is heaven.
Reason makes us human
But love makes us believe we can conquer all
I ask for fire and you give me rain
I ask for nothing and you give the same
And I'd give you the sky but
All you want is heaven.<start>Look into my eyes
You will see, what you mean to me
Search your heart, search your soul
When you find me then, you'll search no more
Don't tell me its not worth trying for
You cant tell me its not worth dying for
You know its true, everything I do, I do it for you
Look into your heart, you will find
There is nothing there to hide
Take me as I am, take my life
I would give it all, I would sacrifice
Don't tell me its not worth fighting for
I cant help it, there's nothing I want more
You know its true, everything I do, I do it for you
There is no love, like your love
And no other, could give me more love
There's nowhere, unless you're there
All the time, all the way
You cant tell me its not worth trying for
Just cant help it, there's nothing in the world I want more
I would fight for you, yeah I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you, yeah I'd die for you
You know its true
Everything I do, I do it for you<start>Used to have home
With a room and bed
A porch and a driveway
With a big garage
But I traded it in
I kept some faith
And laid my head down every night
And it seems so far away
Remember me now 'cause things
Always change
Five long years have gone
I've done some time
Sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same
I learned somethings
About the places I saw
I learned something about myself
I guess it came the hard way
Now I know what counts
I've got one prayer
It's in your confidence
I know all the places
I don't want to be everyone's
Gone there's no one just me
Remember me now 'cause things
Always change
Five long years have gone
I've done some time
Sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same
Remember me next time I go away
For the first time I want to stay
I can count one hand here today
The only thing that matters to me
Anyway and it seems so far away
Remember me now 'cause things
Always change
Five long years have gone
I've done some time
Sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same<start>Way you look at me like that, something's got to give pretty soon
Throw it on a camel's back, something's got to give pretty soon
Living hard to chase the dream, way beyond our ways and means
Yours don't mean a goddamn thing.
That's what you said, but, don't believe it.
That shattered look upon your face, something's got to give pretty soon.
Swallow, but can't stand the taste, bark at the wind, chase the moon
Living fast and drinking lots. List of things we haven't got.
Tired of life with the have-nots
That's what you said and I believe it.
Maybe what you need's for someone to send you flowers
Someone strong and mean who can prove he has the power to
Show you more than charm and take you on your way
To where you want to be at the end of the day
And it breaks my heart in two to know it ain't meant to be
But, it ain't me,
It ain't me.
And you say it's these things I do, about me that's attracted you
So if I started doing something else, what would we have left.
And you say you just want compromise, then act so different all the time.
These reasons why you said goodbye, just another way of telling lies.
Something's got to give, got to give pretty soon
Or else we're gonna lose the very things that made it bloom
Sitting in silence in a cold and lonely room
While the world goes on around us
Something's got to give, got to give pretty soon
Or else we're gonna hate each other
And that would be the saddest thing I ever seen.<start>Take you back
Do do do do
Take you back
Take you back
Do do do do
Take you back
I don't know why I should even try
To take you back
Take you back in my life
You say there's a reason
That you can't live without my love
Push me back
You push me just too far
You never stop
You are what you are
You lie and you hurt me
When you do the things you do
Now the nights are forever
All the low lie together
No one else will it matter
There's nothing you can say or do
Change my mind of you with you
Don't put me down no more
Here's walking out the door
You know that I love you
But I can't be a fool no more
I need someone in my life<start>Don't hold yourself like that
You'll hurt your knees
I kissed your mouth and back
Is that all you need
Don't build your world around
Volcanoes melt you down
What I am to you
Is not real
What I am to you
You do not need
What I am to you
Is not what you mean to me
You give me miles and miles of mountains
And I'll ask for the sea
Don't throw yourself like that
In front of me
I kissed your mouth and back
That's all I need
Don't drag my love around
Volcanoes melt you down
What I am to you
Is not real
What I am to you
You do not need
What I am to you
Is not what you mean to me
You give me miles and miles of mountains
And I'll ask for the sea<start>The blue of blue
Is mostly grey
Ain't no silver line
No brighter day
Last of the coming up
Didn't come my way
Looks like I'm down here to stay
Down to stay
So kick me, I won't feel a thing
My senses have all been run
And there's nothing left of the used to be
But the weeping that's just begun
That sour taste too late
But now I duck my head
And no cradle rocks this empty bed
If crying's not good for me
Then I guess I'm doing wrong
So I sing this crying song
Cry along
You packed it in too soon
You lose me but not your nerve
Well I guess I know it's what I deserve
Crazy to think that I could keep you on reserve
And so the curtain falls
Curtain falls<start>Want to rule the outlands
And I want to rule the sea
But if you're not coming back
I will sleep eternally
I don't want no heavy dogmas
And pearls crush my teeth
I just want my sailor
To sail back to me
The captain has a treasure
(He)
Says I hold the key
Only roses swim and blossom to you and me
Want to rule the outlands
And I want to rule the sea
But if you're not coming back
I will sleep eternally
Every time you're up and gone
I'll be up and gone
Just as long as I can
Every time he be up and gone
He be up and gone
Just as long as you tell me
Want to rule the outlands
And I want to rule the sea
But if he's not coming back
I will sleep eternally<start>Can you dig it?
Can you DIG it?
True Goo by Free Paul Simon Magoo
Fame confront truths stink glory one
Your itchy doo
Angry spoo just grew and grew
till the drops were few
As I look the windo shutters
Flap! Hark!
Yonder my sweep, in willowing flocks
Star brave one,
Sewer brave one, Sewer pipe stretch throught the city
twist, turn, FEEEL
Grow!!! Zoom Zoom
For burn ash in the epitamy of life
Pesimism, Prision, Bisim, Bossom, of epitism illusion TWIST
Pancake batter splatters, campas boredom, preppy basket!?
Nail the sink cupboard, spaces enempt
Ice too cold, almost warm FREEZE
As the goo is harvested, magic scorches, sight is born
A wave is broken
Need Need Need Need... BARK!
Confusion state of country
Plastic metal needed pass at the hand
WOAH the river WOAAH
The concrete, can we? Shelter...
Fuck the pigs
Middle finger grows and grows
Bash the wack, tear dehydrated, my sweet pack your danger growth
Twist melt please pace the week
One that might break or snap
For since we are one compound compound
Serhan Serhan we rest
Embalm me!!! Ahhhh pleasure! Life is born!!!
Thank you

HÃ¸r musikken ikke tenk pÃ¥ ord
Tenk pÃ¥ hav og himmel sol og jord<start>Wasted tears of sadness fall
on an acid ground
there's no vision left to realise
self destruction all around
We ignored the danger
all warnings left unheard
to return it's too late
bound to our fate
we feel like a flightless bird
There's no hope, no future
all (our) (true) values slain
meanless words to disperse our fear
empty promises drown in pain
All honest feeling
are caught in chains
we believed all the lies
now pay the price
despair flowing through our reins
In a world of madness
ruled by war and crime
where violence cries
for more sacrifice
quite at home in perverted rhymes
We pray for rescue
but all in vain
no tomorrow for change
for the future is now
as only little time remains
Vanity and pride
brought blindness in strife
true values held in hide
still burning inside
captured in the claws of fear we enter
the eclipse of mankind<start>Then they came on me
They dragged me from the bar
Still wet from sweat and beer
I bruise so prettily by men
Blinded by their fear, these men
Broke my back and made me lame
Then she said to me
"I'd give you everything to make it like before
To make you love me like you used to"
Make you love me more
She said to me
"Your life is large but your mind is lame"
I can't believe my eyes
When I see the truth
And all the things I've done
And every place, I'm queer
I never stay, I run
I know now why I live in shame
Lame
It's hard to sleep at night
I hardly ever sleep at night<start>Now I see this way

Even though I wish for miracles

I want to love? I want to live<start>You're real efficient
You work 15 hours a day
Your basic food is beta-blockers
The 21:st century way
You log in everyday
To your favorite gang bang site
Still you can't get it up
In the "heat of the night"
You're talking all the time, but say nothing at all
Incest and rape-jokes is your way to have a ball
You think Treblinka
Is a new Playstation game
You own a golden fountain-pen
But you can't spell your name
Take me away, take me far, far away
'Cos I need to get rid of the Dead Soul Man
I try and I try but I don't have the strength
Won't you take me away from the Dead Soul Man
I am the dead soul man and so, my friend, are you
Frustrated sons of bitches
All dressed up without a clue
It's not a pretty sight to see your intellect erode
Think for yourself before your brain implode
Take me away, take me far, far away
'Cos I need to get rid of the Dead Soul Man
I try and I try but I don't have the strength
Won't you take me away from the Dead Soul Man
What happened to your son?
What went wrong, yuppie mama?
What are we gonna do?
With all the dead soul men...<start>Right now I feel - just like a leaf on a breeze
Who knows where it's blowin'
Who knows where it's goin'
I find myself somewhere I - I never thought I'd be
Going 'round in circles
Thinking about you and me
How do I explain it when I don't know what to say
What do I do now - so much has changed
Nothing I have ever known - has made me feel this way
Nothing I have ever seen - has made me want to stay
But here I am - ready for you
I'm torn 'n, I'm fallin' - I hear my home callin'
Hey - I've never felt somethin' so strong - oh no
It's like nothing I've ever known
Now you're the one I'm lookin for
You're the one I need
You're the one that gives me - a reason to believe
Following a star - has lead to where you are
It feels so stong now - this can't be wrong now
Nothing I have ever known - has made me feel this way
Nothing I have ever seen - has made me want to stay
But here I am - ready for you
I'm torn 'n, I'm fallin' - I hear my home callin'
Hey - I've never felt somethin' so strong - oh no
It's like nothing I've ever known
It's like nothing I've ever known
Right now I feel - like a leaf on a breeze
Who knows where it's blowin'
Who knows where I'm goin'<start>I ran down the road, pants down to my knees
Screaming "please come help me, that Canadian shaman gave a little too much to me!"
And I'm writing a novel because it's never been done before
First house that I saw I wrote house up on the door
And told the people who lived there they had to get out "cause my reality is realer than yours"
And there's no time for the present
And there's a black dog on the bed
I went to the backyard to burn my only clothes
And the dog ran out and said "you can't turn nothing into nothing is with me no more"
Well I'm no doctor but that monkey might be right
And if he is I'll be walking him my whole life
I rode to Malibu on a dune buggy with Neil
He said "you're gonna have to drive me down on the beach if you ever want to write the real"
And I said "I'm sorry, young man what is your name again?"
Now everywhere I go in West Hollywood
It's filled with people pretending they don't see the actress and the actress wishing that they could
We could do ayahuasca
Baby if I wasn't holding all these drinks
Something 'bout the way Violet whips her hair
That makes me empty my pockets on the corner to corner bumming twenties as if I was the mayor
I don't need any new friends, Momma
But I could really use something to do
So if you're up for it sometimes
I swear you wouldn't have to be my muse
Heidegger and Sartre, drinking poppy tea
I could've sworn last night I passed out in my van and now these guys are pouring one for me
I'll never leave the canyon 'cause I'm surrounded on all sides
By people writing novels and living on amusement rides<start>Caroline laughs and
It's raining all day
She loves to be one of the girls
She lives in the place
In the side of our lives
Where nothing is
Ever put straight
She turns herself round
And she smiles and she says
'This is it'
'That's the end of the joke'
And loses herself
In her dreaming and sleep
And her lovers walk
Through in their coats
She's...
Pretty in pink
Isn't she?
Pretty in pink
Isn't she?
All of her lovers
All talk of her notes
And the flowers
That they never sent
And wasn't she easy
And isn't she
Pretty in pink
The one who insists
He was first in the line
Is the last to
Remember her name
He's walking around
In this dress
That she wore
She is gone
But the joke's the same
She's...
Pretty in pink
Isn't she?
Pretty in pink
Isn't she?
Caroline talks to you
Softly sometimes
She says
'I love you' and
'Too much'
She doesn't have anything
You want to steal
Well
Nothing you can touch
She...waves
She buttons your shirt
The traffic
Is waiting outside
She hands you his coat
She gives you her clothes
These cars collide
She's...
Pretty in pink
Isn't she?
Pretty in pink
Isn't she?<start>Let loose
Before it causes problems
Let loose
Before it tears you apart
Let loose
Let loose
You gotta reach out, reach out and touch someone [Repeat]
Boy (Oh girl) you better communicate
Before it's too late
You better start talking
You better talk
Let loose
Before it causes problems
Let loose
Before it tears you apart
Don't bottle it up
Don't bottle it up
Like a bottle of pop
A bottle of 7-Up
You better let it
Talk from your heart and not just your brain [Repeat]
C-O-M-M-U-N-I-C-A-T-E

C-O-M-M-U-N-I-C-A-T-E

Channel 17, ho
Communicate, ho
Communicate, ho
Baby baby bounce it off your satellite,
Yeah<start>It was the day I hoped would never come
It wiped all of my dreams out
You said you're sick of me and sick of love
I used to care about, I used to dream about
Don't cry your eyes out
You gonna ruin your makeup
And keep your mouth shut
It's just a fucking break-up
I should have known that
You've always lied
You want me to get out of here
I'll go, and sing along
Hey Deejay let the music play
Nobody's gonna listen to it anyway
Hey Deejay let the music play
It's a great day, it's just another great day
And one day I will
No longer care
No longer to think how to repair
Myself
I gave you a chance
To fix it all
While you remained so mean
Remained so small
Hey Deejay let the music play
Nobody's gonna listen to it anyway
Hey Deejay let the music play
It's a great day, it's another fucking great day<start>Black and broken
Dirty mirror
Hands I've shaken
Blessed with fever
Back and forth against the wall
With second sight to see it all
Moving slowly
Until she breaks apart the animal
[Chorus] x2
She prays her voices stop
Remove the cavity
A fragile hero
Makes a villain
Where'd your mind go?
A simple serum
Back and forth against the wall
With second sight to watch the fall
Mele
[Chorus] x2
[Bridge] x2
She plays around
We've lost you now
[Chorus] x2
Stop<start>Chicka-pow! Don't shoot me down
Oh no, how low can you go
Driving fast to get to work
Queen is there just being a jerk
Running her mouth a million times an hour
She's talking trash
It's going sour
That stuff that makes you hurt
Cut you down, make you hit the dirt
Say, she's driving that DIVA thing
That D-I-V-A diva thing
Sing
Why can't you say you're sorry
For treating me so naughty
Just want an apology
Is that against your personal theology
What'd I do to deserve this
How'd I get on your bad list
Just want to make it right
Please Queen please
Let's not fight
Let's not fight, let's not fight
I don't wanna fight tonight
You had your chance to right your wrong
Can't we all just get along
[Chorus:]
You go and talk behind my back
Don't you know that's whack
It's a personal attack
Oh snap
Some friend you are to me
You're Miss Personality
Are you too blind to see
You're such a drama queen
Fresh off the chopping block
She cut me deep and it hurts a lot
She hit me with her best shot
And never gave a second thought
That's too much drama for me mama
Why do you like to stir it
When I am near you throw fits
You cry oh me, me, me
Ain't you got no decency
You dish it out, I take it
I wish you'd just stop fakin'
In your mind your grass is green
But I know you's a drama queen
You're such a, you're such a
You're such a drama queen
[Chorus]
She's a drama queen, if you know what I mean
She'll get under your skin and make you scream
Oww, drama queen
I need a vaccine 'cause you so mean
You got a disease I don't need
And it pays no heed to get it
So better quit it
'Cause a friend in need is a friend indeed
And you ain't that
You's a drama queen
Emphatic, dramatic, you're like a psychosomatic
You're always so problematic
Your drama is cinematic
There's no comparison to the damage you've done
But you've only begun with your hit and runs
[Chorus]<start>In the days when children sung
In the heart claim shattered son
You were right in telling them
Where they were beneath the snow
Space call god right now
Let them be judged upon
What they've done to him my son
In the snow before the sun
Please god right now
Please god right now
If they could only say all the things they saw would they?
They were only boys
With time I create
Invest investigate puzzle saw belated
If they could only say all the things they saw would they?
They were only boys

Which one killed my boy?
My question to incriminating convoy
I want death and blood for my son
We will curse that forms the sun

Please god right now

They were only boys

Meet Mrs. Doreen Pompidou / She'd like to do the shimmy on top of you
The wall is coming down / The one which holds the house up
A brass band playing in a dumptruck is visible through clouds of brickdust
As people dressed as cows form an orderly queue
For a drug that makes you dead for a second or two
I raise myself from my punchbowl, drowning:
"The Yakuza are singing--it can't be true!"
"Go home, Bible Mike!" / "Go home, Bible Mike!"
"Go home, Bible Mike!" / "Go home, Bible Mike!"
Her hand squeezes mine and I shudder
She says, "That was one shock, now here comes another
You really don't remember, do you?" / I said, "Why? Am I supposed to?
Me, the slut of dishevelled women / whom fun has made sad and careless?"
And she's knocked me onto the greasy floor
And a eunuch is barring the only door
Pilar, in her room above the farmacia,
Smiles as she pictures your little thing
Imagine her surprise when she looks through the window
And sees you riddled with bullets while the cops all sing
"Go home, Bible Mike! / Go home, Bible Mike!
You preach without a right / Go home, Bible Mike!"
You don't make me laugh, you don't make me horny,
So what the hell are we doing here?
Gasping all night in this Nazi city
You bit it, I'm bleeding, we're sliding in my blood
Humping in my blood / Market my blood! / Market my blood!
You got a tourist mind
Deaf, dumb and blind to all the pain you bring
This is more than just sin
"Am I really such a nightmare? If I had a home I'd go there."
Anytime you look / This court says, "Take a hike"
The slate will not be wiped / Just go home, Bible Mike
Go home, Bible Mike...<start>If you had the chance I know you, surely would
And anytime I want it baby, I could
Said you'd never saw it coming, did you dear
But you can't run from everything you fear
Hey, don't you want to fall in love?

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
A long time ago before the ice and the snow
There were giants that walked this land
And with each step they took, the mighty mountains shook
And the trees took a knee and the seas rolled in
Then one day they say the sky gave way
And death rained down, it made a terrible sound
There was fire everywhere and nothin' was spared
That walked on the land or flew through the air
And when it all was over
The slate wiped clean with a touch
There God stood and he saw it was good
And He said<start>Well, all my friends are boppin' the blues
It must be goin' 'round
All my friends are boppin' the blues
And it must be goin' 'round
I love you, baby but I must be rhythm bound
Well, the doctor told me
Boy, you don't need no pills
Yeah, that doctor told me
Son, you don't need no pills
Just a handful of nickels
And a jukebox will cure your ills
Well, all my friends are boppin' the blues
And it must be goin' 'round
All them cats are boppin' the blues
And it must be goin' 'round
I love you, baby, but I must be rhythm bound

Man, I don't feel no pain
Yeah, jitter bug caught me
Man, I don't feel no pain

people I'm in one room little country shack
I'm sitting here thousand miles from nowhere

I'm gonna leave early in the morning
people because I'm 'bout to go out of my mind
I'm gonna leave early in the morning

I'm about to go out of my dog gone mind
I'm gonna find me some kind of good man

so many ways
so many way you can get the blues
so many ways, yeah
so many way, so many ways you can get the blues
yeah, when down here on one of these cotton fields
Lord, you ain't got nothing to lose.<start>When you were a boy
You had no place inside your parents' world
You were falling like the leaves
From an old and dying tree
You went to school
But the teachers made you feel a fool
While the children played with joy
You were the one they would avoid
Some day
You will find a better place to stay
You'll never need to feel this way again
Again, again
Show a smile
They'd like to have you in their members' club
They'll buy you drinks and tell you lies
They pour rumbrella with some ice
No one cares
About that fucking pretty face you have
It means nothing much this life
So find the highest cliff and dive
Some day
You will find a better place to stay
You'll never need to feel this way again
Again, again
Some day
You will find a better place to stay
You'll never need to feel this way again
Again, again
Some day
You will find a better place to stay
You'll never need to feel this way again
Again, again<start>The winds of change are now blowing again,
I can sense it, I can feel it, Like a breath of fresh air.
Thousands upon thousands of words, is our right to reply.
A question of priorities, in a universal role.
Memories surround of bitter times, so don't expect
Too much, as all seems lost,
When the worls finally says give up.
From the dark wind wept streets, I see a glimmer of
Light, of hope, a presence of defiance.
I wonder, and I realise that while some wait for miracles,
others may help create them.
From a room that has no view, I gaze from the window
I consider our purpose, the cold starsd look down, and
There's a feeling that someone, or something, is
Always looking, strange, 'cos it's, it's like, careful
Observation, the sweetest manipulation, those smiling
Images of love, A confused pattern of trust, a feeble
Structure fleeing, responsibility and feelings, and I
Wonder who, what, why where and when and if in fact
I'm still believing?
In all those moments we've shared.
Of all the things that we have been through.
I feel happiness, sadness, remeber the places that we
Have been to push our views and ideas home.
Of meeting people who feel alone.
Of seeing anguished faces smile again,
An achievement? Well I hope.
As we swim from the shore,
I can feel the undercurrent.
I hear songs of hope and glory, but how deep is their
Ocean? We turn and face obsession,
A painful reminder from tomorrow.
The seas a funny shade of blue now,
Do we drown in mistakes sorrow?
A nation remains silent, burnot out skulls, blank expressions.
An image of convenience, in reality's succession.
Blind in the one-eyed kingdom, following those who
Followed last, who follow those,
Who followed before them.
Is there a future in the past?<start>You don't even have to try
It comes easy for you
The way you move is so appealing it could make me cry
Go out drivin' with my friends
In bobby's big old beat up car

Good times, bad times gimme some of that
Good times, bad times gimme some of that
Good times, bad times gimme some of that

Fiction halts, the drugs began to wear thin, oh
Colored obvious, the world slid off it's tilt
Waking up each night from the gravitational pull
What is the sound of something trying not to make a sound?
So sick of all the same old shit, so spent on being sick
Will everybody wake up before it gets too late?
Ghost wrote in the middle of the night, chocking and obvious
Will everybody wake up before it gets too late?
Always afraid, afraid of what the truth may bring, oh
The last horse has finally crossed the finish line, yeah
Long and clever titles doesn't bring a clever song
This show has been going downhill since season one
Just an open book reading itself to sleep
So sick of all the same old shit, so spent on being sick
Will everybody wake up before it gets too late?
Undone in the middle of the night, stinkingly obvious
Will everybody wake up before it gets too late?<start>woke up slow this morning to quiet walls and a sunlight flood. this place it seems so empty and everything except for this wait has left me. try not to dwell on this time. how long can it last? hold your breath and close your eyes. the pain will pass. try to rise above the distance of all that you want and soon you'll know the why. why and for what. for the sake of a love like no other. for something we've never known. for the hope of another chance at happiness. we forsake. i've watched the colors fade where windows cast their shape. the same way i have changed in the light of these dark days. i believe in happiness and in love that never fails but the longer i wait here the more they just seem like a fairy tale. i need you to save me. you seem beyond a stones throw. helpless hands tied. i try but this garden's overgrown on the inside. try to rise above the distance of all that i want and remember the why. why and for what.<start>Don't close your eyes
Just let me be
The air you breathe
Everything you need
Don't say goodnight
I'll take you there
Anywhere, anywhere you want

With nothing left to prove, but everything to lose
And all I know is all I want it is you
All I want it is you
Just let me lead
You will follow on
Until the sun comes asking questions now
Then fall to sleep inside my arms
And hear my heart cryin' out for you
Lay it all down
Heavens been found in your arms
All that I know is that I won't let go until you do
With nothing left to prove, but everything to lose
And all I know is:

There's an awkward young shadow that waits in the hall
He's cleared all his things and he's put them in boxes
Things that remind him, life has been good
Twenty-five years, he's worked at the paper
A man's here to take him downstairs
And I'm sorry, Mr. Jones, it's time
There was no party, there were no songs
'Cause today's just a day like the day that he started
No one is left here that knows his first name
And life barrels on like a runaway train
Where the passengers change, they don't change anything
You get off, someone else can get on
And I'm sorry, Mr. Jones, it's time
Streetlight shines through the shades
Casting lines on the floor and lines on his face
He reflects on the day
Fred gets his paints out and goes to the basement
Projecting some slides onto a plain white
Canvas and traces it, fills in the spaces
He turns off the slides, and it doesn't look right
Yeah, and all of these bastards have taken his place
He's forgotten but not yet gone
And I'm sorry, Mr. Jones, and I'm sorry, Mr. Jones
And I'm sorry, Mr. Jones, it's time<start>Baby, I've been wanting more of that, love you give

Late at night when you're alone
Do you think about me now that I'm gone?
When I'm on the road I often dream and think of you girl
And I hope that you do too
We don't, gotta work it out

So I sing a song of love, Julia.
Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering
In the sun

So I sing a song of love, Julia.
When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia.

So I sing a song of love, Julia.

Take my word for what its worth
Life at a stand still not one second passes
And in the asphalt I see a best friend

Don't move
Save me
Cry out
To god above
And would you save everyone if you
Saw them dying
Watch as they slip through your hands
Bring me back to life bring them back to life
One step further form all of this
Abstract emotions in dealing with death
The warmth of my breath turns to ice
Beating the concrete your hands
Cut and bruised and in the end
Not a question of why

Don't move
Save me
Cry out
To god above
And would you save everyone
If you saw them dying
Watch as they slip through your hands
Bring them back to life bring them back to life
One step further from all of this
Never forget what I'm bleeding
Gasp for air now I am apart of this
Leave me suffering never break
Your promises
Never forget and you'll
Never forget what I've done
And would you save everyone
If you saw them dying
Watch as they slip through your hands
Bring me back to life bring them back to life
One step further from all of this
Don't move
Save me

Sex
When they wanna be suave 'n' debonair

Sex
At yer bongo party an' yer weenie roast

Some girls try it 'n' go on a diet
Then they worry 'cause they's too fat
Who wants t'ride on a ironin' board?
That ain't no fun...i tried me one
Grow that meat all over yer bones
Work the wall with the local jones
'n' while you do it, remember this line
The sniffer says it all the time
"the bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'
The bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'
The bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'
The bigger the cushion..."
Makes no difference if you're young or old

Don't you act like it's made of gold

Ladies they need it just like the guys

Maybe you could use a protein surprise

Any time, anywhere

Why d'ya think it's growin' there

Some girls try it 'n' they don't like it
They complain 'cause it don't last
Who wants to ride on a debutante?
They talks too much...they moves too fast
Watch the scenery while you ride
You can be very warm inside
'n' when the train goes 'round the bend
Check the shrub'ry on the other end

The bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'

It will be alright, feel now sorrow
I'm right by your side
We're in this together, trust is the key
Blood brothers forever, destined to be
I got your back and you got mine
This friendship equals quality
And heart combined
I got your back and you got mine
Someone to put your trust in
In these worried times
Don't you worry about the narrow-minded
Or what they say
Head high, continue to walk your own way
Ignore the commotion
Evil tongues speak
Entertainment for losers
Salvation for the week.<start>Every inch of you looks like a lady
So don't get caught here in the city at night
And if you want to take a chance and go down crazy
I sell protection for a price
Well, call it love or call it murder
This is the crime of the century
No, don't point that thing on me
[Chorus]
All in all my aim is better
Shots as clean as a mean goal-getter
A bad man on the run
I'm gonna be your dark stranger
Contact man 'tween you and danger
I'll protect you baby with my elephant gun
Every minute counts and you play both sides of the law
Mm, these dangerous days
Mean nine lives doin' anything at all
A lot of folks been blown away
Well, call it love or call it murder
This is the crime of the century
No, don't point that thing on me
[Chorus]
Bang!
Well, call it love or call it murder
This is the crime of the century

Don't try to use that thing on me<start>N -U- T - T - M - E - G

Churning in the vault of bitterness and hurt
Twist what should be left alone in solitude
Still I picture you trying to repent
Feel the burn, watch us burn
Time and time was spent finding out the truth
We believed in our undying youth
Nothing ever more modeled after you
Nothing ever more modeled after
Now, everybody knows, anyone can see
The way the story goes and what you did to me
Tasted once before, unlock sacred doors
Shut to our requests, say you did your best
Feel the burn, watch us burn
Time and time was spent finding out the truth
We believed in our undying youth
Nothing ever more modeled after you
You said you were our friend
And the lies were common place
What happened to forgiveness?
I'll never see your face again, again
Time and time was spent finding out the truth
We believed in our undying youth
Nothing ever more modeled after you
Nothing ever more modeled after<start>Elephant,

Oh, Elephant,

You're sad, and in a cage but that's irrelevent,
Irrelevent,
'Cause everyone is jealous when they see me riding by,
On a friend of such great size!
Other kids ride bikes,
That's true,
Or daddy's pick them up from school,
But that won't do for me you understand.
Understand!
Other kids have horses,
Other kids have dogs!
Other kids have hamsters,
Other kids have frogs!
But the pet for me is something much more grand......

It's bumper touching bumper on the motorway
The sun is in the sky just now
But the road is grey
They drive in Winnebagos from the Everglades
Pulled over by the troopers in the mirror shades
The Caravan is sorry
The driver has a twenty and change
And we're leaving all the road for dead
We're getting tired of the twists and turns
You gotta go when human nature calls
We're driving, we're driving
Through the valley of malls
And God forgive the passengers if we should fail
To find a penny fountain of a half-off sale
I need a merchant
I've just started searching for the Holy Grail
Fighting for the freedom from a common bond
To be a barracuda in the guppy pond
So little time for so many things to try on
And we're leaving all the road for dead
We're getting tired of the twists and turns
You gotta go when human nature calls
We're driving, we're driving
Through the valley of malls<start>I'll for you...

Maybe there is something that you know that I don't?
We adopt a brand new language
Communicate through pursed lips
And you try not to put on any sexy clothes or graces
I might never catch a mouse and present it in my mouth
To make you feel you're with someone
Who deserves to be with you
But there's one thing we've got going
And it's the only thing worth knowing
It's got lots to do with magnets and the pull of the moon
Why won't our love keel over as it chokes on a bone?
We can mourn its passing and then bury it in snow
Or should we kick its cunt in and watch as it dies from bleeding?
If you don't want to be with me just say and I will go
We can change our partners, this is a progressive dance
But remember it was me who dragged you up to the sweaty floor
Well, this has been a real
I've got shin splints and a stitch from weed
But like a drunken night, it's the best bits that are colored in
Should look through some old photos
I adored you in every one of those
If someone took a picture of us now they'd need to be told
That we had ever clung on tight and maybe not with arms at night
I'd say she was his sister but she doesn't have his nose
And now we're unrelated and rid of all the shit we hated
But I hate when I feel like this and I never hated you<start>Now that it's all said and done
I can't believe you were the one
To build me up and tear me down
Like an old abandoned house
What you said when you left
Just left me cold and out of breath
I felt as if I was in way to deep
Guess I let you get the best of me
Well, I never saw it coming
I should have started running
A long, long time ago!
And I never thought I'd doubt you
I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know
I'm slowly getting closure
I guess it's really over
I'm finally gettin' better
Now I'm picking up the pieces
From spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together
Cause the day I thought I'd never get through, I got over you!
You took a hammer to these walls
Dragged the memories down the hall
Packed your bags, and walked away
There was nothing I could say
And when you slammed the front door shut
A lot of others opened up
So did my eyes, so I could see
That you never were the best for me
Well, I never saw it coming
I should have started running
A long, long time ago!
And I never thought I'd doubt you
I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know
I'm slowly getting closure
I guess it's really over
I'm finally gettin' better
Now I'm picking up the pieces
From spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together

Papa he said if you've done everything I've told you to
And I've never had the feeling in the past
And I never felt I needed to impress
I should know

Oh papa he said if you don't someone else will

by John Sebastian
Performed by Crosby, Stills, & Nash
on "Nintendo: White Knuckle Scorin' "
1991
How have you been, my darling children
While I have been away in the west
Though you are strangers I feel like I know you
By the way that you treat me and offer to feed me
And eagerly ask if I'll stay for a rest
Now sit yourselves down in a pile here before me
I wish I had presents for each of your smiles
But I have been travelling without much to carry
Just a broken guitar case with paint on the sides
A bag and a few signs to help me get rides
But here are some beads from the throat of a Princess
Who lived in the years around 200 BC
Divide them and wear them, but make sure to share them
'Cause I want you to have them in hopes that you'll be
As lovely as the lady who gave them to me...
And here is a strange European guitar string
I found on the floor of a club in Marseilles
It's fat for the third string and skinny for the fourth string
But I kept it in hopes that I'd use it some day
It's funny how people just keep things that way
And here is a turtle from the Long Island Expressway
He says that his home has been covered with tar
So I gave him a ride on the back of my suitcase
And he says that he'd like to stay here in your yard
At long last his life won't be quite so hard
And how have you been, my darling children
While I have been away in the west
Though you are strangers I feel like I know you
By the way that you treat me and offer to feed me
And eagerly ask if I'll stay for a rest
And how have you been, my darling children<start>Said who's that girl there
I wander what went wrong so that she had to roam the streets.
She don't do major credit cards I doubt she does receipts it's all not quite legitimate.
And what a scummy man just give him half a chance I bet he'll rob you if he can.
Can see it in his eyes yeah that his got a driving ban amongst some other offences. And I've seen him with girls of the night. And he told Roxanne to put on her red light. We're all infected but he'll be alright cos his a scumbag don't you know... said his a scumbag don't you know.
(Guitars)
Although your trying not to listen.
Avert your eyes and staring at the ground.
She makes a subtle propostion.
I'm sorry love i'll have to turn you down.
Oh and he must be up to something
what are the chances, sure, its more than likely.
I've got a feeling in my stomach, you start to wonder what his story might be, what his story might be.
Chorus:
Yeah, cos they said he changes when the sun goes down,
And they said he changes when the sun goes down,
And they said he changes when the sun goes down around here, around here...oh
Look here comes a Ford Mondeo, isn't he Mr Inconspicuos.
And he don't even have to say out'
shes in the stance ready to get picked up.
Bet shes delighted when she sees him.
Pulling in and giving her the eye,
because she must be fucking freezing.
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky.
It dun't stop in the winter no.
And they said he changes when the sun goes down,
Cos they said he changes when the sun goes down,
and they said he changes when the sun goes down around here.
Well they said he changes when the sun goes down, over the river going out of town
and they said he changes when the sun goes down around here, around here oh.
and what a scummy man.
Just give him half a chance i bet he'll rob if he can.
Can see it in his eyes yeah that his got a nasty plan.
I hope you not involved at all.<start>My heart ticks in beat with
These kids that I grew up with
Living like life's going out of style
And you came to watch us play
Like a big shot talent
But at the end of the day you know
Where we came from and where we call home
Hey Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, we love you back
They'll say it's not worth
So we'll leave this town in ruins
Living like life's going out of style
And you came to watch us play
Like a big shot talent
But at the end of the day you know
These busted lips we take back home
Hey Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, we love you back<start>Over Lord Hills Bridge we must go
Where the hearts burn at night and the guns unload
Oceanographers are charting the rise of the seas
Today is a submarine setting course to a land under me
Nature springs are lost in a war
The imperious demands are the local law
It is pulling us down to the Emperor's Gate
Everyone is a submarine, looking for a dream far away<start>Well, bless my soul, what's wrong with me?
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' queer as a bug
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
Uh huh huh, oh, hey, yeah, yeah
Well, my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Now who do you think of when you have such luck
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
Uh huh huh, oh, hey, yeah, yeah
Well, please don't ask what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up but I'm feeling fine
When I'm near the girl that I love best
My heart beats so that it scares me to death
Well, she touched my hand what a chill I got
Her kisses are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
Uh huh huh, oh, hey, yeah, yeah
Well, my tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this soul of mine
That's to have that girl that I love so fine
She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her kisses are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
Uh huh huh, oh, hey, yeah, yeah

It's not lacquer or gold
but it shines anyway
It's nothing you can hold
No one can steal it away
It's invisible
to everyone but me
But if you're for real
Well, maybe I'll let you see
inside of me
and if you're true
I just might save a place for you
In my box
is the last ray of the sun
In my box
are the songs I left undone
In my box
is the smile off your face
You've got such a pretty face...
It's not paper mache
and it's not made of glass
There's no lock or key
but it was nice of you to ask
It's invisible
to everyone but me
But if you're for real
I'll let you see
inside of me
and if you're true
I just might save a place for you
In my box
I'll let the wizard guide the way
down the river
to my little candle cave
in my box
is your favorite fantasy
So, are ya gonna tell me about it now?
It's my own work of art
It depends on my mood
Can be as hot as a kiss
or as cool as a groove
It's invisible to everyone but me
But if you're for real
Well, maybe I'll let you see
It's as free as your mind
and as real as your flesh
It's deeper than soul
It's the best of my best
In my box
is the last ray of the sun
In my box
are the songs I left undone
In my box
is everything we already know

Under her rock, she feels quite safe
Hangin' out with her can sometimes be fun
But other times, I'm in a state of shock
We make up but not much later, I'm stung
The crazy stuff that she will do
The second chances always bring me undone
With all the shit she puts me through
Now, I'm afraid she's an alien
You never know just what she's gonna do
I'm afraid she's an alien
But she sticks to me like glue
I wonder if my friends are thinking I'm dumb
Whenever she yells her abuse
She has me wrapped around her littlest one
In bed, there's nothin' she won't do
Now, I'm afraid she's an alien
You never know just what she's gonna do
I'm afraid she's an alien
But she sticks to me like glue

A phase I'm going through
Dreaming of the willow pattern
Theres something I should do
Id never see the world without you
You opened up my eyes
Id never see the world without you
And now I realise
Never turn around
Never transit / chance it
Never play dead
Don't ever walk backwards
Never turn around
Never transit / chance it
Never play dead
Don't ever walk backwards
You should never take a thing for granted
You only miss it when its gone
And its stupid to be holding grudges
Because we only got so long
So long [x7]
Im dreaming of the willow pattern
She kept it in her room
An oriental china set
A gift I would assume
She told me how you loved her so much
That everybody died
Another universal theme
Dont hold it all inside
Never turn around
Never transit / chance it
Never play dead
Don't ever walk backwards
Never turn around
Never transit / chance it
Never play dead
Don't ever walk backwards
You should never take a thing for granted
You only miss it when its gone
And its stupid to be holding grudges
Because we only got so long
So long [x7]
I affiliate with you [x6]
I know wed all have died
Never turn around
Never transit / chance it
Never play dead
Don't ever walk backwards
Never turn around
Never transit / chance it
Never play dead
Don't ever walk backwards
You should never take a thing for granted
You only miss it when its gone
And its stupid to be holding grudges
Because we only got so long
Laaauuuh...<start>Hey mister can you help me
I'm a loner on the run
I'm just looking for tomorrow
And I ain't gonna hurt no one
I jumped headfirst into a bottle
I was looking for a friend
Came up just short of nothing
I didn't find the truth I only found an end
So tell me who's gonna save me
Or my father or my son
When the only justice a man can see
Is the barrel of a loaded gun
I been broke and I've been hungry
I think they're both my middle name
But I don't never ever never seem to get enough
Still guess I can't complain
'Cause what you get in life you take it
You've gotta hold on and make it last
They say good things come to those who wait
But it's life that goes so fast
And when there's just one rule you live by
Each day you kiss the rising sun
When you live and die by the life we breathe
In the barrel of a loaded gun
Guns talk to me in my sleep at night
And a gun somewhere is burning
With my name
Winners are losers
And losers will have to face
All those yesterdays
And all of the dreams they blew away
So mister can you help me
Or are you my gun
Have the ghosts of justice
Brought you here to me to taste
The barrel of a loaded gun
There's justice in the barrel
Of a loaded gun<start>, ,

Nothing's changed, I am still here
If you're running out of breath
And your building's burning down
You can jump, I will catch you
Nothing's changed, I am still here
With heavy hands and an absent mind
Did I blow your candle out?
With shortened words and a lack of time
Am I ever on your mind?
Was I cruel and never there?
Nothing to rely on
Was our romance a black hole?
You kept the better half than me
Well if you really wanted to know
Well no the earth's not moved for me since
I wish I could've given you lightness
The lightness that you deserve

I can't wait, I can't wait, come over
Come over, come over, come over
Why don't you come over?

You touch a wall
And if you could
You would suck up its plaster
You want to pull a brick
To see
What is behind a wall when you sleep
The light of a slit
Clings to thoughts
When you are pushing through it
You feel breath
On your wet shoulders
Then run into a lift and falls down...<start>Is this another complication I face?
Here is the mistake, coming back to catch me
To you, to you I hold
Now I know that I'm alive
All the loneliness is filled by you inside
And as I finally breathe the air
You opened up my eyes, now I'm alive
A lesson in breathing is never using control
Seconds from this place, I've never been so unsure
To you, to you I hold
Now I know that I'm alive
All the loneliness is filled by you inside
And as I finally breathe the air
You opened up my eyes, now I'm alive
To the heights, to the heights, there is hope
It's been waiting all along
To the heights, to the heights, there is hope
Waiting
Now I know that I'm alive
All the loneliness is filled by you inside
And as I finally breathe the air
You opened up my eyes, now I'm alive<start>In chorus we stagger.
Closed eyes
Bring more light inside.
Small breeze
Helped us keep our strides.
The large gust
Won't keep you in tact.
And if i'm forewarned
I'll make the same mistake.
Fill in the blank.
And though the crane is gone i see my way,
I may hit one too far,
Been said it's all more likely to save.
And though the rain is gone,
Regenerates,
I pushed it calm and still,
Until it's all just breaking away.
Wait.
For him.
He might be late.
Light a match to the fire,
Sit warm by the fireplace,
Here he comes, it's the realtor,
Maybe he'll have something different to say.
"take it all"
No one sees what someone sees,
Built my house on sand,
No one knows what someone knows,
If rebuilt i'd protest.
No one hears what somone hears.
Thats the sound of my scar.
I'm tense but i breathe.<start>Oooh Ya save your time and think it over
Spend your time with your wife or your lover
Lover wins cant stand the pain
Lover wins and her days are filled with pain
And you know, yes you know that its so
Oooh Ya save your time and think it over
Spend your time with your friends and your lover
Neither can win they cant stand the spin
Leave it until they feel no more pain
And you know, yes you know that its so
Lord you feel, yes you feel that its real
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
Oooh Ya save your time and think it over
Spend your time with no one but your lover
Be with her in the bad times and the good
Be with her always like you know you should
And you know, yes you know that its so<start>Can't shake these thoughts
Can't slip this skin
Can't open up
Can't let you in
Descending into darkness
Descending into madness
All used up
My days are sealed
Fallen further
Than you'll ever know<start>There's beauty inside - there is beauty inside
The darkest of nights - the black and red lights
This spring has been frozen - the gods have been chosen
They dance in their blood
Your life has been sold - your life has been sold
For your face looks so old - how your face grew so old
Near the city of broken hearts - to the city of broken hearts
But we all fell apart - how we all fell apart
We drive with the devil on our side
We drink the land - it tastes like wine
I never said my love was true
I put that in the hands of you
Communication, no communication - just sex and frustration
You're killing, you're killing, you're killing, you're killing
You're a killer kid, you are a killer kid
But you did what you did - oh you did what you did
We drive with the devil on our side
We drink the land - it tastes like wine
I never said my love was true
I put that in the hands of you
There's beauty inside - there is beauty inside
The darkest of nights - the black and red lights
At the tip of your head - it's black and it's red
How does it feel to be dead? (4x)
I know how it feels to be dead (7x)<start>Rock you in my car
Feel the fire superstar
Turn up the bass and adjust the seat
I'm on you like a shark on meat
Push the button on the stereo
Then baby, we can go go go
I got new speakers that go really loud
I can't wait to get away from the crowd
C'mon, c'mon, I wanna get you alone
I wanna have you all to my own
C'mon I gotta get you alone
And lure you into the danger zone
I wanna take you down
But everyone's around
Let's make them all go away
Tonight I gotta make my play
Push the button on the stereo
Then baby, we can go go go
I got new speakers that go really loud
I can't wait to get away from the crowd
C'mon, c'mon, I wanna get you alone
I wanna have you all to my own
C'mon I gotta get you alone
And lure you into the danger zone
C'mon baby get in
Let's turn up the sin
Now it's dark and there's no one around
Baby you make my heart pound
Push the button on the stereo
Then baby, we can go go go
I got new speakers that go really loud
I can't wait to get away from the crowd
C'mon, c'mon, I wanna get you alone
I wanna have you all to my own
C'mon I gotta get you alone
And lure you into the danger zone
C'mon, c'mon, I wanna get you alone
I wanna have you all to my own
C'mon I gotta get you alone
And lure you into the danger zone<start>I am a Fluke in the world
I haven't spoken a single word
I'll have to wade through the bullshit
Baby just to find my own vision of pearl
I am a fluke in your world
And even tho it's a bit absurd
I've been living in a dreamworld man
And I hope you'll enjoy what I've heard
Can't you see through me?
Can't you hear through me?
Just a moment in time...
FREAK!!! ...FLUKE!!!
Down and under I've felt the toll
You can't hurt me any more
I'm not afraid of you anymore!
Can't you see through me?
Can't you hear through me?
...Corona without a lime.<start>Five minutes to flush
Nature:
They say they just want to question me the interuption
4 in the morning they knocked and caught me fuckin'
Throw on something mad provocative play with the top lock
Buy me some time so I can hide the shit kinda quick
Move the guns clip the herb
They got me shook up plus my nut was disturbed
Hide the chocolate pickin' up shells form off the carpet
Baracaiding the door for war like a hostage
It's my crib, got my name on the lease
Can't explain niggas just get arrained and released
But who snitched set me up, I think it's you bitch
Sacrificing my life for you two kids?
Truth is, I got a business to lose eyewitness news
Paper tellin' bitches to move, police turned this into a zoo
Mad reporters, I laugh as I'm sippin' my brew
They think they caught us
Hook:
4 in the morning Feds are out at the door
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do when they come through for you?
Ooh ee ooh ee ooh ee yeah yeah yeah yeah
4 minutes left
Nature:
About a minute went by they knocked harder
My bitch went hysterical in shock
Slapped her to calm her
4-4 cocked to armor
It's been a long day now I raid with jakes playin' in the hallway
It's senseless, enter my crib and can't prevent this
Blockin' my enterence, trying to knock it off the hindges
Battering rams coming inches, my hoe was buggin'
Throw a fit thowin' puttin' coke in the oven
Like I'm Larry Davis the phone rang some D.A. bitch
"Nature turn yourself in" I didn't say shit
Knowin' in my heart I'm a stay rich
It's abusing, confusing them until they lose patience
Try to ease up, calm my nerves with the cheeba
Hoping the door doesn't fall before the keys flush
Thieves rush, plus the riot squad
No surrender no retreat shit's deep but times is hard
Hook
Nature:
By the time they had busted in I had touched the cash
Just flushed the last hundred grams nigga subduct the math
They made me either that or let them take me
Still in my night clothes fake like I'm asleep
Spoke to my rat heard him ask where the coke at
Predicate felon hope to never go back
They had survelance aware of all dealings
Knew about bitches that liked to shoot and loot kept in ceilings
Searching my spot behind curtains stay cursing
Chief of police finally meet him in person
But I just flushed the yayo what could he say do
Trying to flip on me, once was on the payroll
Trying to laylow he can't find what he need
So instead I'm cuffed taken down for some weed
But it's just for a short say, I call the Firm then emerge
On the streets to return the next court day
Hook<start>I thought the river was safe for now
I could never think like you
Seem like derailing a train of thought
Is impossible to do
Each little image a runaway car
I've got one more frame, one more frame to choose
Tonight won't let me wander far from you
If I do
Tonight won't let me wander far from you
I've been sinking in knee deep tar
Now it's sticking in my shoes
Dreaming it's over and all right now
Feels beautifully untrue
If the kids going over the bridge look down
They could see me here, see me here, see me here confused
Tonight won't let me wander far from you
If I do...
Tonight won't let me wander far from you
If I do...
Tonight won't let me wander far from you
If I do...
Tonight won't let me wander far from you
Filling it over with stinking ground
I can see it in my head
Leaches and lovers all six feet down
And they're always playing dead
We can't see to the surface so help me out
I've got one more try, one more try, one more try, one more try or two
Tonight won't let me wander far from you
If I do...
Tonight won't let me wander far from you
If I do...
Tonight won't let me wander far from you
If I do...
Tonight won't let me wander far, wander far, wander far from you<start>Make this clear in a statement
And break me here through the pavement
And I can trust in the silence
And I'll adjust to the violence
Inside, I can't deny I've burned
Alive in pain but without you
I'll go insane reaching out to
I'm almost gone but believe me
I feel so wrong
I can't believe what you've done to me
(Would you cut me if you love me)
I can't believe this was meant for me
(Don't you touch me don't you push me)
I can't believe what you've done to me
(Would you cut me now)
Life (life) It passed away (wrong)
Another chance at this life but it passed away (I'm so alone)<start>[Verse 1]
I fell for every line on your lips,
only lies
A broken heart in the first degree
I thought we were just fine
should have seen all the signs
they were right in front of me
The way you looked at me
Made it easy to believe
I was blind, but now I see
[Chorus]
And I was falling for you
I couldn't help myself
You hypnotize me
I was under your spell
You got me LoveSick
but now baby I can tell its just a game to you
so baby shame on you
[Verse 2]
I thought you were the one,
but its all come undone
And now you're begging me to take you back
Can't you see? I've moved on
all those feelings are gone
There's no turning back
The way you looked at me
Made it easy to believe
I was blind, but now I see
[Chorus]
And I was falling for you
I couldn't help myself
You hypnotize me
I was under your spell
You got me LoveSick
but now baby I can tell its just a game to you
so baby shame on you
And I was falling for you
I couldn't help myself
You hypnotize me
I was under your spell
You got me LoveSick
but now baby I can tell its just a game to you
so baby shame on you
This was just a game to you
You'd never thought you'd lose
You'd never thought you'd-
This was just a game to you
Now the blame's on you, so shame on you
[Chorus]
And I was falling for you
I couldn't help myself
You hypnotize me
I was under your spell
You got me LoveSick
but now baby I can tell its just a game to you
so baby shame on you
And I was falling for you
I couldn't help myself
You hypnotize me
I was under your spell
You got me LoveSick
but now baby I can tell its just a game to you
so baby shame on you
It was just a game to you
so baby shame on you, shame on you
It was just a game to you
baby shame on you<start>I've got something up my sleeve
I've got something up my sleeve
Without saying the word
I'm ready for a party tonight
My fire is on the front burner
Can't you tell by the mood I'm in
You have no need to doubt
Do I have to spell it out
Just read between the lines
Yeah, tonight we're going to unwind
I'll make you see
Baby, we can talk it out
Everything, everything
That I'm thinking about
I've got something up my sleeve
I've got something up my sleeve
Something up my sleeve
There's a place just for two
And it's just right for me and you
To let our emotions go free
And be what we want to be
Turn off the lights
Pull out the phone
Do not disturb
Nobody's home
Baby, for so long
I wanted to get next to you
Just let me love you
There's no telling what I may do
'Cause
I've got something up my sleeve
I've got something up my sleeve
Something up my sleeve
Stay with me, baby
We can work it out
Just let me get next to you
Ain't no telling what I may do
I've got something up my sleeve
I've got something up my sleeve
I've got something up my sleeve
I've got something up my sleeve, baby
I've got something, baby
Up my sleeve, baby
Give me a chance
I've got something, baby...<start>There's a light in the darkness
Oh, tomorrow
And the wheel keeps turning in the skies
Never close your eyes before tomorrow
A new life, a new love will find its way
So hold on, child, to what you've got:
To your dreams, your visions and your heart
Hold on, child, and wait until dawn
Because tomorrow is the seed of a new life
There's a light in the darkness
Oh, tomorrow
And the wheel of fortune's turning round
Never close your eyes before tomorrow
Because the fire of love is still alight
So hold on, child, to what you've got:
To your dreams, your visions and your heart
Hold on, child, and wait until dawn
Because tomorrow sees the end of your night<start>It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And signing songs of joy and peace
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm going to make a lot of money
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I made my baby cry
Well she tried hard to help me
You know, she put me at ease
And she loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye
Well It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
Singing songs of joy and peace
God I wish I had a river
I could skate away on<start>You dont know what song I could sing inside,
You dont know what song I could sing inside.
You dont know what song I could sing inside,
You dont know what song I could sing inside.<start>It is ever gonna come
I want to believe but I can't really see
'Cause I'm afraid to even lift my head up
If I look for you are you gonna be gone
I want to jump ahead and just run, so it'll be done
I'm stuck, I can't get up
I want to but I can't stop the chase
Want to win the race
I know, it's all a show
And you promise me
You keep telling me
Tomorrow is close, but will it ever come
And you promise me
You keep telling me
Tomorrow is close, but will it ever come
I never thought it'd be more than this
But you promised me and unfortunatley
I bought it completely although
After I wake up I'm sure that I'll know
That today was just the rest of my life
I'm not gonna die sitting there hoping that I
Can someday come and claim the ring
It's not anything I know or want to become
And you promise me
You keep telling me
Tomorrow is close but I know it will never come
And you promise me
You keep telling me
Tomorrow is close but I know it will never come
Will tomorrow ever come
Will tomorrow ever come
Will tomorrow come, I just want to know
Will I be happy tomorrow, happy tomorrow, happy tomorrow
I want to know if I've gotta reason
To keep hanging on when I want to let go
Or is it just part of a much bigger show
'Cause I'm not gonna just lay down
While I slowly drown
I never agreed to do that
And I'm not gonna hold my breath
'Till there's nothing left
I'd start laughing anyway
And you promise me
You keep telling me
Tomorrow is close but I know it will never come
And you promise me
You keep telling me
Tomorrow is close but I know it will never come
Will tomorrow ever come
Will tomorrow ever come
Will tomorrow come, I just want to know
Will I be happy tomorrow, happy tomorrow, happy tomorrow<start>Come on now mystery train
Bring her back to me again
I want to feel her hold me tight
And never be lonely at night
Roll down your mystery track
Pass the cities all blazin' black
I'm counting hours till she comes back
Not gonna be lonely again...
(Chorus)
Oh I can hear you coming
Yeah & you're carrying something
Got my baby on your mystery train
(Repeat chorus)
Yeah come on now mystery train
Through the mountains blowing rain
But when you get there mystery train
It'll never be rainy again...<start>Face them, the time will erase them
Stop trying to chase them
I've taken my place and it's not worth the tears
I waited so long for this love
As another was slipping away
I waited so long for this moment
As the others were wasted
Cast a shade to save your eyes
Take this time to turn and say goodbye
Frozen, the words go unspoken
New victims are chosen
My heart will be broken but so will my fear
I waited so long for this love
As another was slipping away
I waited so long for this moment
As the others were wasted
Cast a shade to save your eyes
Take this time to turn and say goodbye<start>They call it stormy Monday, but Tuesday's just as bad
They call it stormy Monday, but Tuesday's just as bad
Wednesday's worse, and Thursday's also sad
Yes the eagle flies on Friday, and Saturday I go out to play
Eagle flies on Friday, and Saturday I go out to play
Sunday I go to church, then I kneel down and pray
Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy, my heart's in misery
Crazy about my baby, yes, send her back to me<start>If there's a heart inside your eye
If there's a clock inside your head
If there's a girl outside your bed
Put your face in my place
My head is falling off my head
And I don't want to see clear again
Everyone is talking about Jesus
Everyone is talking about Jesus
Everyone is talking about Jesus
Everyone's fucking my princess
Goodnight to my new dead wife
Goodnight to my Nazi friend
I'm standing on the tip of my stinking ship
Hey princess over there
Why you sitting over there
When you've got a warm spot to share
In the prince's bed
In the prince's bed
In the prince's bed
In the prince's bed
In the prince's bed<start>He's a detection device,

Let me hold it in the palm of my hand
What I wanna hear
Tell me that's your best laid plans
You cross your fingers when you
Look me in my eyes
Fire in the hole
Higher than you've ever known
It's a bitter pill
It's a hard old row to hoe
You're standing in the way
Fucking up the ebb and the flow
You smile and tell me that this
Happens all the time
Fire in the hole
Higher than you've ever known
I can't see why you are the one
Who holds the key
When you take yours it looks like
Nothing left for me<start>im calling in sick

And so are we, so are we
Dreams come true
In blue Hawaii
And mine could all come true
This magic night of nights with you<start>You keep knockin' but you can't come in
The way you love I adore
You always come never know where you been
But a-now I'm here baby to even the score
You're up, you're down
You're always running in place
Triathlon if you please
You're always beggin' me for a taste
But I ain't up to snuff if you sneeze
Yak yak yak
Lord you give me the bends
Heads and tails
You're all out of love
[Chorus:]
Like the reason a dog
Has so many friends
He wags his tail instead of his tongue
Your older sister
She's a lot like you
She likes to grab my microphone
Now there ain't too much she won't do
Especially when we're all alone
You're up, you're down
You're always runnin' in place
Triathlon if you please
Her mind's on rewind and erase
You might get shot, babe
When you're shootin' the breeze
Yak yak yak
Lord you give me bends
You're heads and tails
Are calling for love
[Chorus x2]
Your older sister
She's a lot like you
And there ain't too much she won't do
There's always something
That you got to say
I lose my mind and then I surely fade away, yeah
Yak yak yak
Lord you give me the bends
You're heads and tails
Now look what you done
[Chorus x2]<start>I started out so starry-eyed
Full of hope and wonder
And I wore flowers in my hair
Not aware I'd been defiled
(Every time I see you) I know it's going down
(How can I believe you) karma comes around
I know this ride, you must be there by my side
You going down, I must be descending
I didn't want to play the song
That gave people so much hope
I turned my back and turned away
Here's the rope that made me choke
(Every time I see you) I know it's going down
(How can I believe you) karma comes around
You can see it in my eyes
You can read it on my face
You can hear it as I cry
God, I hope it's not too late
Can I try to make it up to you somehow?
Can I try to make it up to you somehow?
Now my race is finally run
And as I tumble to the Sun
All these dreams I can't achieve
Brought me crashing to my knees
My descent has now begun
All the music left undone
My world, it is descending<start>We're riding on a rainbow
We're flying free
We're riding on a rainbow
Yes, you and me
There is a place I love in africa,
That they call the rainbow land.
It is a place to grow and live as one,
In a brotherhood of man
There is light that comes from africa,
And it's shining round the world.
Let all the colours speak of pride and joy,
In a voice that must be heard
We're riding on a rainbow,
We're flying free,
We're riding on a rainbow,
Yes, you and me.
There is a heart I hear in africa,
And it's beating like a drum.
Let everyone get up and to the stars,
We will go marching on.
I had a dream I was in africa,
I was soaring like a bird,
And then a million voices all around,
Was singing to the world...
That we are riding on a rainbow,
We're flying free,
We're riding on a rainbow,
Yes, you and me.
We are together on a rainbow
We're flying free,
We are forever on a rainbow,
Yes, you and me.
We are riding on rainbow
We're flying free
We're riding on a rainbow
Yes, you and me<start>[lyrics:Jason Kohnen]
I hear the music
sweet tunes that caress my soul
music begging for music
it woes my soul ...so...
it enchants me...

food for the poets thought
ink for the thirsty pen
lust like the ravaging whore

Everything I own
Well, some day I'm gonna get lucky
And down the road you know I'm goin'

Emotions Tide in like a Breaking Wave,
I can't remember yesterday,
I don't recall ever being this way before
'Cause I feel weak,
Like a Defenceless Animal,
Weak.
Though my Will is gone,
Weak.
As if I never really had any strength at all.
From the inside I could feel myself lost in memory with you,
From the inside I could feel myself Paralyzed,
From the inside I could feel a change coming over me with you,
From the inside I could feel myself spinning clarity with a memory of you.
Within a glimpse,
I can see my entire life,
Flash before my eyes,
Is this more than momentary thing.
'Cause I feel weak,
Like a Defenceless Animal,
Weak.
Though my Will is gone,
Weak.
As if I never really had any strength at all.
From the inside I could feel myself lost in memory with you,
From the inside I could feel myself Paralyzed,
From the inside I could feel a change coming over me with you,
From the inside I could feel myself spinning clarity with a memory of you.
I'm Lifted To the Sky,
And I feel all my boundaries falling away from me,
And I'm lifted to the sky,
As you bring out the better,
Better, Better part of me
From the inside I could feel myself lost in memory with you,
From the inside I could feel myself Paralyzed,
From the inside I could feel a change coming over me with you,
From the inside I could feel myself spinning clarity with a memory of you.
From the inside
From the inside

Hold it square, roll it around
Throw it in the air, stick it in the ground
But it's too bad, I can't get mad
Cause I'm a roustabout
Tie it loose, make it tight
If it's wrong, do it right
Makes me kinda feel like I wanna fight
But it's too bad, I can't get mad
Cause I'm a roustabout
Orders all day and half the night, from the boss
That guys cousin don't wanna see one minute lost
Stack it up, in the rig
Better still, bring it here
Wanna take it out stick it in his ear
But it's too bad, I can't get mad
Cause I'm a roustabout
A handyman is all I am around this place
Every time I turn around he's right up in my face
Bring it in, drag it out
When I'm slow, boy he shouts
Gettin aweful tired runnin' in and out
But it's too bad, I can't get mad
Cause I'm a roustabout<start>I woke up this morning, and none of the news was good
Death machines were rumblin' 'cross the ground where Jesus stood
And the man on my TV told me that it had always been that way
And there was nothing anyone could do or say
And I almost listened to him
Yeah, I almost lost my mind
And I regained my senses again
Looked into my heart to find
That I believe that one fine day all the children of Abraham
Will lay down their swords forever in Jerusalem
Well maybe I'm only dreamin' and maybe I'm just a fool
But I don't remember learnin' how to hate in Sunday school
Somewhere along the way I strayed and I never looked back again
But I still find some comfort now and then
Then the storm comes rumblin' in
And I can't lay me down
And the drums are drummin' again
And I can't stand the sound
But I believe there'll come a day when the lion and the lamb
Will lie down in peace together in Jerusalem
And there'll be no barricades then
There'll be no wire or walls
And we can wash all this blood from our hands
And all this hatred from our souls
And I believe that on that day all the children of Abraham
Will lay down their swords forever in Jerusalem<start>I love her madly though she loves another boy
A boy who sadly
Is just another boy
He stares and stares and stares
With eyes wide open wide
I stare and stare and stare
And come between her thighs
She whispers me bye-bye
She wants to see a boy cry
She wants to hear a boy sigh
She wants to see a boy lie
A tear ran down my spine
It's summer every day
Summer when you're around
It's summer every day
With eyes wide open round
Tossed old hair for a crown
That girl she owns this town
With a bang bang clashing loud
And a bam bam blackout sound
Down at the picnic ground
Look around
Look around
If a black cat's gonna cross my path it might as well be you
Might as well be you
Look around<start>Jean-Luc Ponty - Violin, Keyboards

I fell down again
But I can't complain
Another false step
Could drive me insane
I only got myself here to blame
So I shake off defeat and I start again
Oh no I said
I wanna go back
But I can't win the shit
And I'm gonna stay on track
Yeah, make a deal like that
I keep my head up
But I never react
I wrote it down a list a month ago
Sixteen chapters of one thing you've blown
The best thing yet
To help you through and through
That she was
I feel her more than you
Don't leave
Don't leave her
I get up just to get knocked back down
I sit up just to get knocked around
I wanna say something
But your out of town
I don't wanna have another show down
I say stand up (hey, yo)

Far above the world

An honor to observe the beautiful solution

The tyrant to power, his day is done
In the worldwide revolution
Yeah, the peaceful revolution
All around this small world
Now the people demand to listen
These truths self evident

As the old die out
The young see a better way
Human rights guaranteed to all
Without regard to race, I say
The beginning of the end
Now the people vote, we will not sin
The tyrant to power, his day is done
In the worldwide revolution
In the peaceful revolution
I see the last frontier and the peaceful revolution
World peace is merely the product of social evolution
The conquest lies in accepting different peoples
And thinking right here at home in the sun's kingdom
The beginning of the end
Of the tolerance that once could sin
The tyrant to power, his day is done
In the worldwide revolution

She wrote me a letter and said what have they done
Placed a crown of thorns an this native son
Oh, maybe they're right, but maybe they're wrong
But what can I do, you're not here you're gone
Something in the air is much too quiet
Hear my heartbeat
The storms that rages from within
Three times thunder, blood runs cold
Got this wound on my soul
Down on Hell's Half Acre
Walking on fire
We got trouble in the wasteland
Down on Hell's Half Acre
Back in the land where buffalo roam
Oh is this my home
She said you've changed, you're not the same
Clouds of napalm and the opium
The damage was already done
Down on Hell's Half Acre
Shakin' with fever
Rumble in the jungle

Power and majesty, praise to the King
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
At the sound of Your name
I sing for joy at the work of Your hands
Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand
Nothing compares to the promise I have in You
My Jesus, my Savior
Lord, there is none like You
All of my days, I want to praise
The wonders of Your mighty love
My comfort, my shelter
Tower of refuge and strength
Let every breath, all that I am
Never cease to worship You
Shout to the Lord, all the earth let us sing
Power and majesty, praise to the King
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar

I try to make it home before it gets light
I'm working hard so some day we can play
When I try to explain you just push me away
Don't push me away, you say
I don't spend enough time with you
Or take an interest in things you do
We call it quits almost every other day
And the rare times we're going strong
We let our pride get in the way
Seems like it's always in the way
But don't let go, don't let our love go
Don't let go, just let our love grow
Sometimes we might drift away, don't let our love go
But don't let go of our love when it feels right
This kinda life can put us both to the test
But it's not a question of who knows best
Our love's a ship that has it's sails a little torn
All we need to do is sew 'em up
And we can weather the storm
Gonna ride that storm
So don't let go, don't let our love go
Don't let go, just let our love grow
Sometimes we might drift away, don't let our love go
But don't let go
No, no, don't let go, don't let our love go
Don't let go, just let our love grow
Sometimes we might drift away, don't let our love go
Don't let go of our love when it feels right
I don't see you for days
When you leave me in the dark
My imagination runs away
Just throw me a line
And I'll still hold on
I'll still hold on
I'll still hold on
And I won't let go
Don't let go, don't let our love go
Baby don't let go, just let our love grow
Oh, no, don't let our love fade away
And don't let go of our love when it feels right, oh no
Don't let our love go
Don't let go
Just let our love grow
Sometimes we might slip away
Don't let our love go
But don't let go of our love when it feels right<start>Maybe I'm right and maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak and maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win and maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Somehow, I know at a glance
The terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start
Then left with a heart that is breaking
Maybe I'll live the life of regret
And maybe I'll give much more than I'll get
But nevertheless I'm in love with you<start>Roll on
The hot music's growing burns, my head's playing tricks
I know it's going, going to my brain
Get burnt up before the feeling
(say goodbye) running through my ways
Flying, dying, crying all night long
Roll on
Never stop your moving, feel the night no don't lose it
Try ?
Ready for the spark
?
It's too much, much too much
He's the winner, he's the sinner, let me ?
Thunder and lightning, stand yourself ?
Thunder and lightning, stand it if you can
Squeezing and teasing, touch you deep inside
Thunder and lightning, feel it in your mind

To be told
And another you, wakes up

In a different place
Way 'cross time and space
The door is open wide
Drawn to a different light
Maybe we'll step inside
In another world
We can show we care
You can be sure I'm waiting there
In another world
When the dice were cast
They laid a crazy path we follow to our graves
But I know in different world
We journey a different way
So we live but life
Isn't what it seems
We're only living in our dreams
In another world
You can believe I'll meet you here

Well, this ain't no game
Yeah, we make great friends but it just isn't the same

Wanna see you smile
And it make my day if you would just stay for awhile
Won't you stay with me?

That heaven sent
Maybe love will come our way
And when I stand upon the land
I threw the dreams into the sea
Maybe they will rise again
And maybe, maybe love will come our way
And maybe hope will come to us again
What is this thing called love?
I know I've found it, it's in your eyes
What is this thing called love?
I know I've found it, it's in your eyes

And all the secrets that they hold
Patiently waiting for these days
And when I look into the sky I see that
Hope is coming soon
Praying love will come again<start>You say I get a little nasty
You say I'm just showing off
In front of the visitors
You say I'm going

He's my offstage prompter
It's true he helps me connect
With my big Napoleon
I don't know that that's about,
What's that about?
We will receive you
In the good room
That still smells of Pledge
Pictures of our smiling faces
Stations of the cross
Of teeth and puberty
She cries at motorcades
She cries at motorcades
She cries at motorcades, she cries
Now before you start
I'm not making fun
People cry at the
Strangest things
Mine is the Venezuelan national anthem
So many deepest of feelings
So much emotional porn
Public declarations
Windy words that fill
The sails of empty vessels
She cries at motorcades
She cries at motorcades
She cries at motorcades, she cries
What is it that gets her?
Is it the strong arm of the state?
Little flags and outriders
Shiny gloves that part
The sea of the little people
Or is the getting from A to B?
Behind tinted windows
Carry the weight of the world
But it's the least we can do
To ease your passage
Leave us in this
Blissful ignorance<start>I can hear somebody knockin'
On my bedroom door
I find it rather shockin'
It's my best friend's girl
(Oo) Imagine my surprise
There's a hungry look in her eyes
See how the love goes
Anybody here know how the love goes
She said, I'm feelin' kinda lonely
And only you will do
Would you like to get to know me
Like I wanna know you
(Oo) No tellin' what a man will do
Face to face with a woman like you
See how the love goes
Anybody here know how the love goes
Oh yea, see how the love goes
I can hear her calling (calling)
But no one understands her (no one understands)
Beggin' me to let her in
And she's waiting for my answer
Should I open up the door
And let trouble walk in
Should I resist her even more
Or tell her, come on in
(Oo) No tellin' what a man will do
Face to face with a woman like you
See how the love goes
Anybody here know how the love goes
Oh yea, see how the love goes
Anybody here know how the love goes
Oh yea, see how the love goes
Anybody here know how the love goes<start>She follows me down to the sound of the sea
Slips to the sand and stares up at me
"is this how it happens? is this how it feels?
Is this how a star falls?
Is this how a star falls?"
The night turns as I try to explain
Irresistible attraction and orbital plane
"or maybe it's more like a moth to a flame?"
She brushes my face with her smile
"forget about stars for a while"
As she melts
Meanwhile millions of miles away in space
The incoming comet brushes Jupiter's face
And disappears away with barely a trace
"was that it? was that the Jupiter show?
Kinda wasn't quite what I'd hoped for, you know"
Pulling away, she stands up slow
And round her the night turns
Round her the night turns
Yeah, that was it
That was the Jupiter crash
Drawn too close and gone in a flash
Just a few bruises in the region of the splash
She left to the sound of the sea
She just drifted away from me
So much for gravity<start>Hip Hop ist gerade in ner beschissenen Lage.
Lass uns Tapeten kleben komm schnapp dir nen Pinsel und Farbe.
Ich brauch nur Silben und Vokale fÃ¼r das Bild dass ich Male.
Rap ist nicht Tod komm wir fÃ¤rben diese triste Fassade.
Wirf einen Blick auf die StraÃe, es bringt mich ziemlich in Rage.
Den deutscher Rap Ã¤hnelt heutzutage ner Kriegsreportage.
Ich glaub mit Hilfe der Sprache und ner Stimmlichengabe
Kann man was Ã¤ndern, doch anscheinend seid ihr nicht in der Lage.
Ist ziemlich Schade, ich wÃ¼nsch mir nur ein bisschen Courage.
HeiÃt nicht dass ich in meinen Texten keine SchimpfwÃ¶rter habe.
Doch das alles mit MaÃ und Ziel ich hab ne wichtige Frage.
Wo ist die Message? Wenn ich nix mehr sage.
Tauch in den FarbkÃ¼bel ein, es war schon lang an der Zeit,
Dass jemand kommt und diesem Gack nen neuen Anstrich verleiht.
Jetzt bin ich da hab mir ne Leiter und 'ne Walze gekauft.
Komm pack mit an, doch richt dich ein denn wir Malen jetzt auf.
Es wird Zeit dass wir die Segel setzen, Zeit fÃ¼r 'ne VerÃ¤nderung.
Zeit fÃ¼r 'nen Tapetenwechsel wir fÃ¤rben die WÃ¤nde bunt.
Komm mit uns mit denn wir malen uns die HÃ¤nde wund.
Zeit fÃ¼r nen Tapetenwechsel, Zeit fÃ¼r 'ne VerÃ¤nderung.
Die Leute sehn' mich an und fragen sich was der da will?
Na, was wohl? Ich male ein modernes Bild!
Quatsch ich rette Hip Hop! Denn ich fÃ¼hl mich dazu verpflichtet.
Und vernichte Rappers selbst wenn ich Penne wie Nudelgerichte.
Denn deutscher Rapp hat seinen Glanz verloren, egal
Dann beginnen wir halt ganz von vorn.
Ich hab, von meinem ersparten Geld etwas Farbe bestellt
Nehm' einen Eimer und schwing den Pinsel wie ein Malergeselle.
Zuerst weiÃ gestrichen, bis dann bunte Farbe alle WÃ¤nde ziert.
Ich sag dir diese ganze Hip Hop Szene wird komplett Saniert.
Zeit dass wir die Segel setzen, Zeit fÃ¼r nen Tapetenwechsel.
Rap wird von Idioten dominiert
Und ich find die schwerste Zeit ihn zu befreien, ich geh mit Hunderten Fans
Raus auf die StraÃe bis dann alles wieder funkelt und glÃ¤nzt.
Denn es wird Zeit dass wer den Thron einnimmt um etwas groÃes zu vollbringen
Und ich werd' soviel Strophen singen bis man die Krone zu mir bringt und das bleibt bei mir
Es wird Zeit dass wir die Segel setzen, Zeit fÃ¼r 'ne VerÃ¤nderung.
Zeit fÃ¼r 'nen Tapetenwechsel wir fÃ¤rben die WÃ¤nde bunt.
Komm mit uns mit, denn wir malen uns die HÃ¤nde wund.
Zeit fÃ¼r nen Tapetenwechsel, Zeit fÃ¼r 'ne VerÃ¤nderung.
Idioten werden Hukke-Busch ernten und ernten dafÃ¼r Applaus.
Industrie wohin man sieht, die echten KÃ¼nstler sterben langsam aus.
Immer das gleiche Schema was fÃ¼r 'ne Aussicht.
Keine Abwechslung, keiner der aus der Masse heraus sticht.
Vielleicht wurd' ich einfach zur falschen Zeit in diese Welt gesetzt.
Besser Blumen im Haar als mit ner Goldkette im RapgeschÃ¤ft.
Denn frÃ¼her war Musik noch Kunst und hat Grenzen vereint.
Heute schafft sie Eifersucht und Neid damals hat sie Menschen vereint.
Es wird Zeit dass wir die Segel setzen, Zeit fÃ¼r 'ne VerÃ¤nderung.
Zeit fÃ¼r 'nen Tapetenwechsel wir fÃ¤rben die WÃ¤nde bunt.
Komm mit uns mit, denn wir malen uns die HÃ¤nde wund.
Zeit fÃ¼r 'nen Tapetenwechsel, Zeit fÃ¼r 'ne VerÃ¤nderung.
Aha, Zeit fÃ¼r 'ne VerÃ¤nderung
Aha
Aha, Zeit fÃ¼r 'ne VerÃ¤nderung
Zeit fÃ¼r 'nen Tapetenwechsel, Zeit fÃ¼r 'ne VerÃ¤nderung
Es wird Zeit dass wir die Segel setzen, Zeit fÃ¼r 'ne VerÃ¤nderung.
Zeit fÃ¼r 'nen Tapetenwechsel wir fÃ¤rben die WÃ¤nde bunt.
Komm mit uns mit, denn wir malen uns die HÃ¤nde wund.

How come I see you
I'm never coming down
From the ceiling sister, losing life
We're spinning down and down
Watch the medium, sister
Gonna flow a note/Come flow now through yourself
I hate to love you now baby on my own I see you
You have to haunt yourself
How come I see your lights
They keep paralyzing me
Try a little light on me
Everything's so bright
How come I see your lights in me
Winding your way through this room full of flesh
Science, sexuality, the heat of your breath
Each bead of sweat, the message is sent
And army of hips, and trenches to defend
You can call your name/court a young maid again and again
Wear out your welcome, and escape on a train
Slither on up to a shining star
Concern yourself with the weird and bizarre
Disappear like smoke in a cold night sky
With a warm soft throb and a flash of light
How come I see your lights
They keep paralyzing me
Hey, try a little light on me
Everything's so bright
How come you see your lights in me

Come away, come away

Watch this turn one's gonna put you away
But I'm doing my very best dancing

I could move out to the left for a while
I could slide to the right for a while
I could get up and back
Right on track
But is right on track
Is that gonna get you back
I've been trying to get your attention
And I'm very, very close to thinking of a way
I could be big and tough and other funny stuff
But you just keep looking the other way
How far away can you go
And still be dancing with me
Would you mind staying in the vicinity
I've not been faring badly
But I would gladly take you back
There must be some kind of bad connection
'Cause this music does not sound the way it did
I got to get up and back 'cause I've been off track
And that may be just why you disappeared
But now I've got you in the corner<start>As I slept
You whispered in my dreams
You said
That fate could never end our love
That there was no power stronger
On Heaven, Earth, or Hell
You gave to me your last soft breath
Now I pray for death
The rest of time without your touch
How I long for death
Then they came
To take you back to heaven's edge
Now soft your wings hang at your side
And the branches close around you
To hold you for all time
I held your heart
And you fell from heaven's grace
Held your gaze
But your eyes see nothing now
Felt your breath
But your voice is silent now
Death comes swift
But love never fades away<start>American black hole.
The life's too sweet to eat like candy.
Drain is now king.
King with a sampler.
Hook me up.
Eat like candy.
Shut the freak up and dance.
I'm only on this ride.
I'm only in your eyes
To see if I'm lucky.
Hook yourself inside.
One way only to ride.
American black hole.
Go be a movie.
Your stars are all in line.
Go be a movie.
After all this...
After all this time.
In the realm of the value neutrals,
Out here puffin' crazy lies to infinity.
American black hole.
The life's too good to eat like candy,
And I want more than you can give me.<start>On the day I was born
The nurses all gathered 'round
And they gazed in wide wonder
At the joy they had found
The head nurse spoke up
And she said leave this one alone
She could tell right away
That I was bad to the bone
Bad to the bone
Bad to the bone
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
Bad to the bone
I broke a thousand hearts
Before I met you
I'll break a thousand more, baby
Before I am through
I wanna be yours pretty baby
Yours and yours alone
I'm here to tell ya honey
That I'm bad to the bone
Bad to the bone
B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-Bad
Bad to the bone
I make a rich woman beg
I'll make a good woman steal
I'll make an old woman blush
And make a young girl squeal
I wanna be yours pretty baby
Yours and yours alone
I'm here to tell ya honey
That I'm bad to the bone
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
Bad to the bone<start>Are You one of the real ones?
She thinks while she checks his face
Or will this turn out to be another one of my big mistakes?
Are You one of the real ones?
He might be, but she could be wrong again
He could be like the others who promised til the end
Are You one of the real ones?
He thinks or have I found me another fake
Does she love to control and manipulate?
Are You one of the real ones?
She might be, but he could be wrong again
She could be like the others who promised til the end
They'll fall for it everytime
It's just that they're the trusting kind
Who ever made it wrong?
Who bid trust and love so long?
Who made the choice for us,
to throw out the words and forget the song of songs?
Am I one of the real ones?
Do I ever think or try to be
exactly what you need or more thanwhat you dream?
Am I one of the real ones?
I could be, but you could be wrong again
But I think I'll fight to make me right for you and for me
Just not for them<start>I'm always around you to show that I care
But I don't know what for
Seems to me that you couldn't care less
So I'm not going to do it anymore
I see no reason why I've placed
Such a value on you
My thoughts have changed now
Oh, I opened my eyes, now I'm through
Lookin' back in my short life, the few pleasures that I've found
All your misconceptions pummel me into the ground
Now I look at your small life and it doesn't mean a bit
I pick myself up off the ground 'cause I don't give a shit
They say all good things come to an end
I wish this didn't apply
You were once someone, called my friend
That's all now changed and I don't know why
Things are very different now
You've got nothing to say
Sad when someone you know very well
Decides to fuckin' die and go away
Lookin' back in my short life, the few pleasures that I've found
All your misconceptions pummel me into the ground
Now I look at your small life and it doesn't mean a bit
I pick myself up off the ground 'cause I don't give a shit, don't give a shit
I look at your small life, it doesn't mean a bit
I pick myself up off the ground 'cause I don't give a shit, don't give a shit
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit
[Incomprehensible]<start>Lead vocal: the flying pickets
Well it's funny you should say that
It's a most peculiar thing
Yes it's funny you should say that
I was talking to a man
And I saw he wore a ring
Yes it's funny you should say that
And I told him of a dream
Where I caught and ate a whale
Then I woke up feeling hungry, he said
Thats a curious tale
For a dream contains a wish
In this case a giant fish
As the pressure you were under
Might have woken you from slumber
To relieve the pangs of hunger
You just dreamed yourself a dish
Well it's funny you should say that
It's a most peculiar thing
Yes it's funny you should say that
For I also met a man
And he also wore a ring
Yes it's funny you should say that
And I told him of a dream
Where the sun was at its height
But my toes were blocks of ice, he said
Let me get this right
You are tall and so your feet
Must protrude beyond the sheet
While you sleep they're unprotected
And it's just as I suspected
You were trying to dream some heat
But there are six white wolves
In the dead of the night
On the branch of a tree
And they have such big eyes
And they're shining so bright
All the better to see
And they have such big ears
All the better to hear
And they're listening to me
And they have such sharp teeth
All the better to eat
And they're looking at me
Well it's funny you should say that
It's a most peculiar thing
Yes it's funny you should say that
I was speaking to a man
But I don't recall a ring
Yes it's funny you should say that
And I told him of a dream
Where I turned into a snail
And he said it is simplicity
To follow such a trail
For this creature takes his shell
Anywhere that he may roam
But work must keep you on the move
You fear your wife may disapprove
So like the snail you just remove
And take along your home
If I step on a line
Something will happen
There are rats in a jar
Something terrible will happen
And they have such big eyes
And they're shining so bright
All the better to see
And they have such sharp teeth
All the better to eat
And they're looking at me
Tell me what do they want
Tell me what can they be
Tell me what does it mean
Tell me what do you see
Fantasia
Nothing is what it seems
Fantasia
A world that's made out of dreams
Fantasia
Nothing is what it seems
Fantasia
Well it's funny you should say that
It's a most peculiar thing
Yes it's funny you should say that
Though I haven't met this man
So he didn't wear a ring
It's so funny you should say that
If I told him of a dream
Where I turned into a hat
That was round and made of fur, would he say
Nothing wrong with that
As I sit here in my chair
I can see your growth is spare
And it is my observation
That this caused you much frustration
So you dreamed a consolation
To replace the loss of hair
I'm going to be a mother
I'm going to have a child
There are wolves in the tree
But the tree never grew
There are rats in the jar
But the curse wasn't true
Fantasia
Nothing is what it seems
Fantasia
A world that is made out of dreams<start>It was meant to be
But all along it never meant a thing
Never stopped to ask you why
You didn't pass me by
Did you see me in your life
Flash before your eyes
Was it just that I wasn't hard enough
Hard enough for you
Stop using my
Confusion
Wait, wait
There's a world out there
Don't you deny me
Give me one last wish
There's a world out there
Elementary
I solved them all
All your mysteries
Settle down and in good time
We can solve all mine
Tell me lies or tell me when
Tear me up again
And I will let you know
When I've had enough
Had enough of you
Stop using my
Confusion
Wait, wait
There's a world out there
Don't you deny me
Give me one last wish
There's a world out there
I know you've got your reasons
Hey let's call it even
Turn out all the lights and go to bed
Still I get this feeling
No one will believe me
When I let these ghosts outside my head
There's a world out there
Don't you deny me
Give me one last wish
Don't you deny me
There's a world out there
Don't you deny me
Give me one last wish
There's a world out there<start>Lord almighty I feel my temperature rising

You're an inspirin' sight

Or taste your kiss

In a world like this
Cynthia, when you pass it seems
Like this whole town drops
Cynthia, maybe it's just me babe
Some fool stuck here watchin' the clock
Well, you give us a reason to start whisper "why"
To stop singin', baby, and salute your style
Yeah cynthia
Well now you ain't the finest thing I'll never have
And when you go the hurt you leave
Well, baby, it ain't so bad
No it ain't cynthia
Yeah there ain't a man in this whole town
Who'll say you ain't fine
D'you hear them guys talkin'
Tell me, baby, do you mind
Well you make us happy, honey, when we feel sad
To see sump'n'so good, in a world gone bad
There's still cynthia, oh yeah
Cynthia, no one knows your number
No one knows where you live
Cynthia, I wonder do you understand
This strange thing you give
Yeah, well baby, is it your style
The mystery in your smile
Or just how cool you walk
In a world gone wild
Ah tell me if you will, cynthia
Well I gotta be pretty naive to believe in you
I know you ain't ever gonna be my dream come true
That's alright, I gotta dream
That's as good as you, cynthia
Oh now baby, this ain't no come-on

Got all we need and so much more
Could take on the world or just do nothing
All I know is

Laying with no make up

Coming alive, coming alive
Now that I never saw it coming
Something our worlds are looking for
Now that I found you, I'm not running
I see you're perfect, you start blushing

All because his mama was Sadie Jones
Cruel words upon him ever since he was young
You ain't got no daddy boy you ain't no man's son
Children heard the facts at home
Talked them up in school
Teased him 'til his mind was bent and bruised
(you ain't got no daddy Dooley Jones)
Weight upon his shoulder
A thorn stuck in his soul
His body walks and talks
But his mind has no control
Dooley Jones, Dooley Jones
You're no man's son, you're no mans child
Spring time satisfaction
This infants heart is wild
Dooley walks the highways
Every day for miles
Babbling to birds flying by
(Babbling to the birds as they fly by)
Somewhere some man hides his eyes
'Cause Dooley is his child
Son of seasons pleasure
Forever runnin' wild
Dooley Jones, Dooley Jones
You're no man's son, you're no man's child
Spring time satisfaction
This infants heart is wild
Dooley Jones, Dooley Jones
You're no man's son, you're no man's child

Forever runnin' wild
Oh Dooley

airy like an open landscape fertile for thoughts that have yet to grow...
so allow me to plant everything i know.
every sign says turn away from this sweet little waist and porcelain face
so deathly pale but beaming with light to shine on my pathetic life.
i try to stay abstract and intact, but she pulls me to the flame,
and silences the words, and leaves me here again.

shaking their fists at the thought of escape,

making ghosts out of good men (you're just a)

whatever gets you through
Take comfort don't be blind to it
You must do what's a right for you
Every one at times must run for cover
Don't you know you really can't be blamed
For in this you're just like any other
There's no need, no need to feel ashamed
Take comfort where you see it
Whatever makes it right
Take comfort when you need it
To help you through the night
By the way we live in our confusion
And the way that we misspend our youth
By the time we're stripped of our illusions
We may find illusions are the truth<start>If your instinct's always right
How about I step aside?
And let you do your thing again
If there's nothing that can fool you
How come you're all alone?
Anything can happen now
When you close your little eyes
They will plunder all your dreams
And take away your teddy bear
I guess you fucked it up
I guess you fucked it up this time
Monkey see and monkey do
Now what a fool are you
To do just what they told you to?
And now you know how roles can change
You used to be so out of range
From anything that brought you down
Every time you go to sleep
You get to feel how this runs so deep
Makes nightmares out of pretty dreams
I guess you fucked it up
I guess you fucked it up this time
I just wish there was something
That you could say
That could make me care again
Something that would make me want to get you out of this
But there is really nothing left
Of anything we've had
So now you're on your own
So now you're all alone
Just like you always wanted it to be
No one to tell you how to think
No one to tell you when to stop
No one to tell you when to think about the fact that you fucked up
That you fucked up
About the fact that you fucked up
That you fucked up
About the fact that you fucked up
That you fucked up again

By the hand
Away from here
To another land
Oh this land in which we live
Where people love and are meant to forgive
And you always prove me wrong
'Cos you're always putting me down
I can't take this anymore
I decided to leave
Walked throught the door
Oh, and why do you think I go
Because you know it can never be so
And you always prove me wrong
'Cos you're always putting me down

He won the lottery and died the next day
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late
Isn't it ironic, don't you think
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought, it figures
Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down he thought
"Well, isn't this nice."
And isn't it ironic,l don't you think
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought, it figures
Well, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out when
You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up
In your face
A traffic jam when you're already late
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife
And isn't it ironic, don't you think
A little too ironic, and yeah I really do think
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought, it figures
Well, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
And life has a funny way of helping you out
Helping you out.<start>Gone you sons of darkness
Gone you tyrants of old

Where we hear Lautari playing
Here in the outfield of Europe
A cry for freedom was heard
Rang out to the world
And we all stood watching
Hold the light
Keep it burnin' so bright
For the children
Copii Romania
Must they live so long In the shadows
Copii Romania
Will we turn and say, like many times before
We did not know?
Once there was a proud people
Filled with laughter and song
Could they feel something wrong
Through the air was blowing?
Here by the mighty Karpatii
The fight for freedom began
The fight for life still goes on
But no-one listens any more
Hold the light
Keep it burnin' so bright
For the children
Copii Romania
Must they live so long in the shadows
Copii Romania
Will we turn and say, like many times before
We did not know?

Must they live so long in the shadows
Copii Romania
Will we turn away tomorrow?

No one does it better I swear
She wears her hair down makeup
She don't even need that stuff
Taking picture everywhere

I would run
I would fly
Into the sun
'Cause I never met a girl like you before
You don't think you're perfect
But you're everything I want and more
And I'll try to make you mine
Cross my heart and I hope to die

A white rose was floating to greet... the sea
Morning light, race me down
The wooden path, can't catch me now... the sea
Will you wade with me? You and me, all alone?
Wadin' on the sea
I grab your toes and now I understand
The symbol of the rose, it floats on my hand
On this great sea strand
Hang on to me and I'll hang on to you
Until the end, or until the day is through
And as we float, I'll wash away that part of me
That lures the devil in the deep blue sea
Will you always float here with me?
I don't want to send second-hand notes
To you my friend, about the sea
So we jump back into the party
And we wade our way out past the bar
I had not planned on going out this far
Hang on to me and I'll hang on to you
Until the end, or until the day is through
And as we float, I'll wash away that part of me
That lures the devil in the deep blue sea
Hang on to me and I'll hang on to you
Until the end, or until the day is through
And as we float, I'll wash away that part of me
That lures the devil in the deep blue sea

And the devil has a smile
And it's thorny and it's wild
And it grows from deep inside
And you try to swim away

You'll never see me
I'll never meet you

I was born at half past one, almost two in the morning
Now my birthday comes again and I don't know how old I am
Half past one or two or three, almost four in the morning
I was born at half past four, almost five in the morning
I was born at half past six, almost seven in the morning
How old am I, you ask of me? One year younger than I used to be
Half past seven, half past eight, half past nine in the morning
I was born at half past nine, almost ten in the morning
I was born at half past ten, almost 'leven in the morning
Today my age is tweedle and twee, I'm prettier than I used to be
Half past 'leven, half past 'leven, almost twelve in the morning<start>My unborn forgive me
I only wish I had the strength to bring
You into this world
More faithful<start>Lost myself in a tangent of words,
Can't decide what I've seen or heard,
Can not sleep for counting sheep,
How long does this river run deep,
How long does this river run deep.
Building a map in order to find,
What's not lost but left behind,
My instinct got bruised,
But I still see,
I was a victim I'll be no casualty.
Just like coming home,
Just like coming home,
Just like coming home,
It was just like coming home,
Coming home.
He said that you weave deadly tricks,
Come right back to the worldly hicks,
Stare it cold in dull surprise,
Spread evil to hell in every tear you cried,
Every tear you cried.
Building a map in order to find,
What's not lost but left behind,
I was a victim I'll be no casualty.
Just like coming home,
Just like coming home,
Just like coming home,
Could be just like coming home,
Coming home.
Cut off my toes to spite my feet,
Drank your poison
Didn't taste too sweet,
Saw that heaven's in my mind,
It's there for me to find,
It's there for me to find.<start>(david henman)

Look at all the places we been, and look where we are
Something is amiss here cause we never seem to get very far
Now I got a feeling, a plan, some music to sing
And I'm looking for the right words to convey the message we bring
If you can hear it, mmm, I'm gettin' near it, if I can say it
Drop your guns, and raise your hands in the air
You're the one that started all the trouble out there
Grease me, I'm near you, blast me, I'm in your way
You're the thing in a song, that really ought to be put away
Now I got a feeling, a plan, some music to sing
And I'm looking for the right words to convey the message we bring
If you can hear it, I'm gettin' near it, if I can say it
Drop your guns, and raise your hands in the air
Drop your guns, and raise your hands in the air
Drop your guns, and raise your hands in the air
Drop your guns, and raise your hands in the air
Drop your guns, and raise your hands in the air<start>Toe to toe
Dancing very close
Barely breathing
Almost comatose
Wall to wall
People hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in Rapture
Back to back
Sacroiliac
Spineless movement
And a wild attack
Face to face
Sadly solitude
And it's finger popping
Twenty-four hour shopping in Rapture
Fab Five Freddie told me everybody's high
DJ's spinnin' are savin' my mind
Flash is fast, Flash is cool
Francois sez fas, Flashe' no do
And you don't stop, sure shot
Go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and you drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light
And it comes right down and lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night, eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercury's and Subaru's
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then, when there's no more cars
You go out at night and eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
Dance toe too toe
Don't move to slow, 'cause the man from Mars
Is through with cars, he's eatin' bars
Yeah, wall to wall, door to door, hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all
Rapture, be pure
Take a tour, through the sewer
Don't strain your brain, paint a train
You'll be singin' in the rain
I said don't stop, to punk rock
Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars when the TV's on
And now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop, and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot
'Cause the man from Mars stopped eatin' cars and eatin' bars
And now he only eats guitars, get up!<start>(J. Hamel)
Walking past one,
Do you want to try for Ottawa?
Let's keep heading north,
Where the sun doesn't boil.
Five blocks past falling,
Bricks and caves and signs,
We'll turn around,
It's so far today.
Next night past one,
I say let's try for Oregon;
The steams were lifting from the road.
If we had some dollars,
The bus would take us anywhere.
But then we'd miss
these humid steams and stars.
Trying to sleep,
The walls were cracking with the heat;
And outside,
The paint was sweating off the walls.
And from the roof,
We saw the neighbors were up too,
And they packed their bags to drive away.
Walking past one,
Do you want to try for Ottawa?
Let's keep heading north,
Where the sun doesn't boil.<start>I'm stoned in the twilight
Screaming on the inside
Give me your water, help me survive
Gonna miss the sunlight
When I lose my eyesight
Give me my red shoes, I want to dance
They search for an answer
But that old man wouldn't listen
Back then I was handsome
Back then he was ignorant
And shave off the years now, it's all inside my head
The boy in the red shoes is dancing by my bed
Put them in a box somewhere, put them in a drawer
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymore
Had garlands in the wings back then
All the pretty little things back then
Calling out my name, oh what fame brings
After curtain calls and bows
I can't see the front row now
Hand me my red shoes just one more time<start>You spurn my natural emotions
You make me feel I'm dirt and I'm hurt
And if I start a commotion
I run the risk of losing you and that's worse
Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
You shouldn't have fallen in love with?
I can't see much of a future
Unless we find out what's to blame, what a shame
And we won't be together much longer
Unless we realize that we are the same
Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
You shouldn't have fallen in love with
You disturb my natural emotions
You make me feel I'm dirt and I'm hurt
And if I start a commotion
I'll only end up losing you and that's worse
Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
You shouldn't have fallen in love with?
Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
You shouldn't have fallen in love with?
Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone

You shouldn't have fallen in love with?
Fallen in love with

la duda infinita, el viejo dolor.
Y mientras recelas del bien y del mal,
por un sumidero, la vida se va.
Nadie da nada por nada, hay que pagar.
Devuelve el espejo tu imagen fugaz
y no estas seguro de tu identidad.
Tu nombre no existe, dejaste el rendil
y en tierra de nadie tendrÃ¡s que vivir.
Nadie te acompaÃ±arÃ¡ allÃ­, nadie.
Y recuerda que no tendrÃ¡s un guia,
no esperes protecciÃ³n ni compasiÃ³n.
Tierra de nadie, oscuridad, sin rumbo fijo debes vagar,
pero piensa que ahora eres libre.
No perteneces a una facciÃ³n,
no crees en dogmas de religiÃ³n,
lo mas probable serÃ¡ que creas solo en ti,
en tu propia fuerza.
No crees en banderas, prefieres luchar
por la madre tierra por la humanidad.
No cavas trincheras en donde vivir
ni crees en consignas por las que morir.
No crees en partidos, es triste saber,
que gane quien gane, tu vas a perder.
No crees en promesas que no cumpliran,
los falsos mesias te engaÃ±aran.
Estas en tierra de nadie ya, en un sombrio lugar,
entre dos bandos que al atacar, te atacan a ti, no puedes huir, irÃ¡n a por ti.
No escucharÃ¡n tu predicciÃ³n de una herÃ©ncia letal,
pero dirÃ¡n:- tiene razÃ³n-, cuando quizas sea tarde<start>I tried the bottle but it only brings me further down
And since you left, oh, there ain't a soul around
I've got to get out, if I get home late, just find a way
I need somethin' that's gonna carry me away
Tell me, where's a train when you need one?
Lord knows I could sure use a ride
Tell me, where's a train when you need one?
'Cause I've never been as lonesome as I am tonight
There's a set of rails that cuts a path to eternity
And I know, yeah, I know there's a boxcar
Waitin' there for me
Now baby, baby, maybe that's the place
I can get you off my mind
I need that lonesome whistle to blow till the end of time
Tell me, where's a train when you need one?
'Cause Lord knows I could sure use a ride
Tell me, where's a train when you need one?
'Cause I've never been as lonesome as I am tonight
Oh, tell me, where's a train when I need one?
Lord knows I could sure use a ride
Tell me, where's a train when you need one?
'Cause I've never been as low
I don't think I've been as low as I am tonight
Oh, somebody tell me where's a train?
Where's a train, where's a train when I need one?
Oh, somebody come, God knows it's been a long run
I've gotta go, take me away<start>Out of a secret longing
They know their way from here
Out of a growing dream
They follow the road we create
I see what I've cut behind me
Lost on the bottom you often found me there
False conscience is beyond me
Lost in the backwoods I lie open to you here
Just leave me here
These men are running hard
But you keep down your voices
Living only to judge heavy
All mysteries aside there was a truth outside
Leave me here and I'm born again
Leave me here in this void again
Now I am open left for dead
Just like salvation comes in the end<start>In room 1023,
if you could only know what you're about to see
you will be ready for what comes to be,
yeah, what comes to be.
You will walk and you will fly, you won't stop to
question why,
and you will learn, and you will grow, it doesn't matter where
you go
You will float on down the road, and you'll be
dreaming as you float,
holding everything you need in your arms.
Well you're on the road,
living life like you have never lived before,
and you won't let nothing hold you in,
on your way to freedom.
and You will walk and you will fly, you won't stop to
question why,
and you will learn, and you will grow, it doesn't matter where
you go
and You will float on down the road, and you'll be
dreaming as you float,
holding everything you need in your arms.
In room 1027, you'll discover heaven,
she'll be like nothing you've ever seen,
like you've never seen.
and You will walk and you will fly, you won't stop to
question why,
and you will learn, and you will grow, it doesn't matter where
you go
You will float on down the road, and you'll be
dreaming as you float,
holding everything you need in your arms.<start>I've seen the light that emanates from you and it makes me feel proud
A voice of reason above the muffling crowds
Such will to live and you've got so much to give
Long lost sincerity
Lost in a world that's been scorched to black
Lost in myself until I finally find
A guide in you and gratitude is mine
I admire the way
Stare down the day from which others shield their eyes
With complete clarity and no trace of apathy
So positive and your heart you freely give
Long lost vivacity
Lost in a world that's been scorched to black
Lost in myself until I finally find
A guide in you and gratitude is mine
I admire the way
Lost in a world that's been scorched to black
Lost in myself until I finally find
A guide in you and gratitude is mine
I admire the way, I admire the way you shine
Lost in a world that's been scorched to black
Lost in myself until I finally find
A guide in you and gratitude is mine
I admire the way
Lost in a world that's been scorched to black
Lost in myself until I finally find
A guide in you and gratitude is mine
I admire the way, admire the way you shine<start>Well, the future spills it's intangibles
An unknown set of variables
A path that spliten infinitely up ahead
So tell me what's the use to pick and choose
From what you should or shouldn't do?
That's time spent better sleeping in your bed
Or wide awake in a shopping mall
Trying clothes on from off of the wall
Yeah, anything to entertain yourself
'Cause a costume can be quite comfortable
It can make you feel more beautiful
It can even make you look like someone else
But it's still you, so there's nothing you can do
Like a bad habit, the one you couldn't kick, there it always is
And it's nothing that no doctor's gonna fix
They pat your back bruised with their accolades
And all four walls are a trophy case
But that doesn't make it any less of a cage
But you can make it all less difficult
By embracing the ephemeral
Then you'd never have to worry or explain
'Cause if it's really all just physical
Then my memory's immaterial
So why then do I remember you at all?
But I do, I do, my friend, I seen your face
We shared a cup, I know the taste
Its sweetness is relentless on my lips
So help me drink in everything that is like a freed convict
Drunk on redemption from the way I've been
But I swear this time, that things will be different
Well, right and wrong, they have never been that far apart
For those who'd write that sentence where you hang, hang
We will be lifted up from all of this
Yeah, we will transcend the insignificance of our existence
Yeah, your body's gone, but angel, you will live
Yeah your body's gone
Now your body's gone
Now your body's gone
Now your body's gone
Now your body's gone
Now your body's gone
Now your body's gone
Now your body's gone

Now your body's gone but angel you will live<start>If it's true that a rich man leads a sad life
N' that's what they from day to day
Then what do all the poor do with their lives?
Have nothing to say on judgment day?
I've been beat up, I've been thrown out
But I'm not down, I'm not down
I've been shown up, but I've grown up
And I'm not down, I'm not down
On my own I faced a gang of jeering in strange streets
When my nerves were pumping and I
Fought my fear in, I did not run
I was not done
I've been beat up, I've been thrown out
But I'm not down, I'm not down
I've been shown up, but I've grown up
And I'm not down, I'm not down
And I have lived that kind of day
When one of your sorrows will go away
It goes down and down and hit the floor
Down and down and down some more
Depression
But I now there'll be some way
When I can swing everything back my way
Like skyscrapers rising up
Floor by floor, I'm not giving up
So you rock around and think that
You're the toughest
In the world, the whole wide world
But you're streets away from where
It gets the roughest
You ain't been there
I've been beat up, I've been thrown out
But I'm not down, I'm not down
I've been shown up, but I've grown up
And I'm not down, I'm not down
I'm not down, I'm not down
I'm not down, I'm not down
I'm not down, I'm not down
I'm not down, I'm not down<start>You live your life recklessly
It's hard to hide jealousy
You talk a mile a minute
You take the truth and spin it

I don't wanna have to do this again

From one altered ego
to another one's fantasy
and yet how should we know?
I confess that it wasn't me
So if you hear no, speak no, see no good
just don't be misunderstood
and if two wrong's don't make it right
keep this thought in mind-
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
it was my split personality
It wasn't me
it's just my split personality, split personality
Talk of the devil
which is the lessor of the evil two?
put two and two together
so what's an evil twin supposed to do?
So if you hear no, speak no, see no good
just don't be misunderstood
and if two wrong's don't make a right
keep this thought in mind-
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, or could it be?
must be my split personality
It wasn't me
it's just my split personality, split personality
My evil Twin
I didn't do it, didn't do it, didn't do it

I feel you in front, I feel you behind
I feel you up above, And I feel you at the side
And you, you're all over me, you're all over me
Your banner is over me, I give it all 'cos
You still captivate me, fascinate me
You still captivate me, saturate me
Inside outside, pulling me in
No matter where I run I know you'll never give in
I see you in the storm, I see you in a kiss

Someone's out when it's over
People steal from you
They take anything they choose
It's good to see you
(I missed you last night)
That's such a lovely color
(It goes with your eyes)
Before we fall asleep
(I just wanted to say)
This all seems so easy
But there's choices to make
Can't decide, then look at the faces
(Candlelight)
We're burning the pages
(Ask us why?)
And hurting ourselves with this false start
(Resign yourself)
And always be
(And we pretend)
Without the one
(It simply gets easier)
Thing you need
(But it doesn't get easier)
Reading words with no replies
When we have these mornings
Where we can say goodbye
I wanted to mean everything to you

You keep coming back disassembled and I
Keep losing this fight

Before we fall asleep

Holding our words at list

We know the way to go

To be here

With her no good lover in front of the bank
Gonna take all the money and leave this town
But the law dogs gonna track 'em down
When mornin' comes she hangs her head
Sittin' there smokin' a cigarette
Her skin is pale sittin' in jail
Hopin' someone will set her free
Explosions have rocked the jail
And all the sirens they start to wail
The man in the duster he runs inside
To grab that girl and take her for a ride
Police running all over the place
They lost that girl it's a big disgrace, yeah
Gonna run but you sho can't hide

The grass is high and the work is done
Send the sun to his sleeping place
Now we'll dance and make love beneath
The serengeti moon
The serengeti moon
The serengeti moon<start>I've made up my mind
I've got to get out in a hurry
I've stated my case
There's no need to come on with worry
'Cause I'm a real straight shooter
And my boot heels are clean
I'll always try to do better
I don't live in no dream
I live down to the line
You know I made it all right (down to the line)
Stayed up all night (down to the line)
It's the way to live life (down to the line)
It's the way to live love (down to the line)
Down to the line, down to the line
Sooner or later it gets you every time
Down to the line
I found me a way
To stand up this way without cryin'
Now they asked for the key
But they're complainin' instead of just tryin'
But I'm a real straight shooter
And my boot heels are clean
I'll always try to do better
I don't live in no dream
I live down to the line
You know I made it all right (down to the line)
Stayed up all night (down to the line)
It's the way to live love (down to the line)
It's the way to love life (down to the line)
Down to the line, down to the line
Sooner or later it gets you every time
Down to the line, down to the line
Down to the line, down to the line
Sooner or later it gets you every time
Down to the line, down to the line
Sooner or later it gets you every time
Down to the line, I'll make it all right
Down to the line, sometimes I stay up all night
Down to the line, down to the line
Down to the line, sooner or later, it gets you every time
I stay up all night, I make it all right
Stayin' up all night, down to the line
Make it all right, down to the line<start>Birmingham, 1974, there occurred a bloody murder
Twenty-one people killed by bombs, Britain reeled in horror
Within three hours the British State found the first available scapegoats--
Five Irish men bound for Belfast, about to board the boat
And this is their story, very sad, but true
Of how six men were falsely imprisoned for something they didn't do
And if any should say, "British justice is the very best in the world"
Tell them, "Well of course it is, for the vested interests it serves"
The men were taken to Morkham to be tested for explosives
Tests which have since proved ambiguous but were at the time held as conclusive
One scientists' word was sufficient to condemn the Irish men
Like vultures the police moved in to begin interrogations
In the circumstances how well do you think the men's rights were observed?
The cops thought they had the bombers; do you think they kept their judgement reserved?
Does 'innocent till proven guilty' have any meaning at all
When you're alone in a police house surrounded by cops being kicked around like a ball
In a dark windowless room half a dozen detectives were waiting
Billy Power was thrown in, the serious questions about to begin
He was kicked and hit and punched from all sides, spread-eagled against the wall
They kicked him and hit him again, a voice from the dark said, "Stretch his balls"
Soon after, poor Billy surrendered, screamed, "I'll tell you anything you want me to say"
Sat in his own excretia, he could hardly speak he remained in a daze
Whilst cops compiled his statement of how he planted the bombs
They threatened him with the treatment again so Billy signed a confession
Thursday night became Friday night, the five men were took back to Birmingham
The threats and the violence continued--a taste of what was to come
Deprived of food and sleep, all part of procedure to break the men
Johnny Walker blacked out twice; they untied his hands while he signed his confession
And Richard McIlkenny was threatened with a gun
The cop said it was OK to shoot him, that the home officer'd given permission
The cop asked him if he was going to sign, put the gun against his head
Playing Russian roulette with a blank; when he banged McIlkenny thought he was dead
Hugh Callaghan, a sixth man, was picked up in Berm and tortured
He, too, hadn't done it but they made him sign a confession to mass murder
Six men kept in isolation no contact with each other
And it weren't until Monday morning that they each got a duty solicitor
Still separate each unbuttoned his shirt to show how he'd been beaten up
The solicitors, filling in legal aid forms, said there wasn't time and refused to look
The only obvious injury, Johnny Walker's black eye in court that day
When he tried to unbotton his shirt all the majistrates said, "Let's take him away"
Leland workers staged a walkout, their banners read "Hang the IRA"
The labor government empowered at the time rushed through the PTA
In their war on the Irish people the British wanted vengeance
Despite glaring omissions in the so-called confessions the six men hadn't a chance
The judge dismissed their claims, said it would've meant there'd been a conspiracy
Between fifteen officers from two different forces, as if it was an impossibility
The police in fact became heroes, got their promotion and victory medals
The six men got life imprisonment and fifteen years on they're still in jail
The men protested their innocence but it fell mainly on deaf ears
They wanted to bring the policemen to trial, the appeal took seven years
Lord Denning dismissed their case out of hand, saying "These actions cannot go on"
What he really meant was the State machine could never admit it's done wrong
Another six years, another appeal, another set of judiciary
To uphold the original convictions as safe and satisfactory
For if it ever gets out that the State judges wrong, well what would people say?
We'd say, "We know who are real enemies are now", and we'd form our own IRA
Oh let me tell a story, very sad, but true
Of how six men were falsely imprisoned for something they didn't do
And if any should say, "British justice is the very best in the world"
Tell them, "Well of course it is, for the vested interests it serves"
For as long as we remain ignorant they'll fight their war against Ireland
For as long as we remain silent they'll imprison any they want
For as long as we keep our eyes shut they'll continue to contain us
For as long as we remain passive they'll trample us into the dust
Hugh Callaghan, Patrick Hill, Richard McIlkenny, Johnny Walker, Gerry Hunter, and Billy Power
Still fighting for their freedom fifteen long years on
Their spirits shall remain when our State is dead
When our State is dead
When our State is dead and gone<start>Confesso l'ho fatto apposta
Nell'intento di ferirti
Ti sembrero' alquanto stupida
Sicuramente immatura
Per tutte quelle volte in cui ho sentito l'istinto di abbracciarti
Per tutte quelle volte in cui ho creduto sul serio
Di annullarti dalla mia testa
Annullarti dalla mia testa
Annullarti
Il tutto in funzione di nessuna logica
Ammetto ero al sicuro
Nel mio guscio di carta pesta
Ho agito facendo in modo
Di non mostrare incoerenza
Per tutte quelle volte in cui ho creduto di non assecondarti
Per tutte quelle volte in cui ho creduto sul serio
Di annullarti dalla mia testa
Annullarti dalla mia testa
Annullarti
Il tutto in funzione di nessuna logica
Il tutto in funzione di nessuna logica<start>It could've been her golden hair
That turned my head
I didn't look to stare
Like I was hypnotized
But I was fixed
On how she pointed slowly down
And low I sank
And still without a sound
The world was far away
And I was tricked
It could've been her silver skin
That drew me on
I didn't mean to spin
Like I was mesmerized
But I was rapt
Without a name or memory
I waited there
Too scared to even breathe?
She sang, she sang, she sang
[Chorus]
She sang
"Tell me you love me
And beg me to stay"
She sang
"Tell me you love me
Before it's too late"
She sang
"Give me your life
Or I must fly away
And you will never hear this song again"
It could've been her crystal eyes
That made me stop
I didn't want to sigh
Like I was stupefied
But I was thrown
And at that point of no return
My whole life hanging
On a single word
To be hers evermore
Or mine alone
She sang, she sang, she sang
[Chorus]<start>Wir hocken uns traurig in die Dmmerung
Auf der Suche nach dem guten alten Schwung
Wessen Schnapsidee war es denn hierher zu gehen
Und dem weichgesplten Elend ins Auge zu sehen
Denn eins war doch vorher vllig klar:
Hier ist nichts, nichts mehr wie es war
Am Tresen wird betrgerisch eingeschenkt
Und die Mehrheit will sowieso ein Sportgetrnk
Und genauso wie sie trinken, so tanzen sie auch
La die Kippen in der Tasche, hier wird nicht mehr geraucht
Das bringt doch die Gesundheit in Gefahr
Hier ist nichts, nichts mehr wie es war
Die 15 Mann auf des toten Manns Kiste
Die muten da weg, weil die jetzt fest vermietet ist
Das Gebsch mit dem sthnenden Ungetier
Das hatte an Armen und an Beinen vier
Das ist auch schon lange nicht mehr da
Es ist nichts, nichts mehr wie es war
Ein alter Sack zu sein, ist hier nicht schwer
Und traurig ist das Leben als Reaktionr
La uns abgehauen sein, bevor man uns erwischt
Und wo ein Wille ist, mein Herz, da ist auch ein Gebsch
Schlielich sind wir jetzt die Avantgarde
Denn es ist nichts, nichts mehr wie es war<start>Picking up the sleaze in my car
Hell no distance too far
Burning down the road in the night

Hapiness spits in your face always

Then you're the fool who lives to die

Eu nÃ£o soube o que dizer
!ah vida real!

Por acreditar que ela viria
Deixei no ar a porta aberta
No final de cada dia

De madura vai ao chÃ£o
Na hora da canÃ§Ã£o em que eles dizem baby
Eu nÃ£o soube o que dizer

I can't remember what just happened
Lyin' in this pool of blood
Is this real or am I dreamin'?
They called an ambulance
And someone's talkin' to me in another language
In distance I hear this song
Will they remember you when you're gone?
What happened today
Can never happen again
So is this really it?
I thought things would be very different
Forgot got to kiss my wife
Forgot to tell my kids goodbye
So can I leave a message?
Just one last thing before I go
Regret these things I've done
It's too late now to tell someone
What happened today
Can never happen again
Will these be my final words?
Will they remember me for somethin'?
Will these be my final words?
Will they remember me for somethin'?
So is this really it?
Well, I thought things were gonna be different
I forgot to kiss my wife
I forgot to tell my kids goodbye
What happened today
Can never happen again
Will these be my final words?

When you need them most
Scared, are you?
You do it on your own
We all did
Scared, are you?
Half the lines you make up here
The best that we can do
Hope bring you luck
Doors open up

On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto
People, don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see,
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way
Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight in the ghetto
Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto
As her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto<start>It's morning two and you haven't called me
It's like a thorn burning in my side
Open the blinds, but something is different, can't put my finger on it
The bright clean air makes me wanna hide
'Cause now, ohh, now, this is how it ends
Based on promises that we'll still be friends
But ba, da, ba, da, ba, ba, ba, da, I know it'll never be the same
Ba, da, ba, da, ba, ba, ba, da, now it's all been broken
Ba, da, ba, da, ba, ba, ba, da, I know it'll never be the same
Ba, da, ba, da, ba, ba, ba, da, you know I'd still do anything for you
Where is the day you used to inspire me?
Where is the time I used to depend?
On the relief of your anchor I thought I'd never need
Now that it's gone, will I slip away?
So now, ohh, now, this is how it ends
Based on promises that we'll still be friends
But ba da, ba da, ba ba ba da, I know it'll never be the same
Ba, da, ba, da, ba, ba, ba, da, now it's all been broken
Ba, da, ba, da, ba, ba, ba, da, I know it'll never be the same
Ba, da, ba, da, ba, ba, ba, da, you know I'd still do anything
This is only a letter
Jumbled words, no false pretense
It's not a true confession
'Cause you've cost me much more than you'll ever guess
But I'm not your fallen hero
Someone who came to your defense
And when it's all done and over
I'll make it, I'll make it, I'll make it, I'll make it make sense
Know it'll never be, know it'll never be
Know it'll never be, know it'll never be

Surrounded by the infidels
As his gaze surveyed the landscape
Crosshairs dancing in his eyes
Peter's cry from the tower did not sound so merciful
As he goes down
Peter hears the voice again
Drowning out the icy sky
In his head is the answer
Loads his rifle with a sigh
Peter's cry from the tower shatters on the street below
And he goes down
He goes down among them all
Peter feels the great release now
He does not cry
Letting go
And he goes down
And we all pretended
Thought he never intended to take upon himself an action
And carry it out
Now we lie in what he knows
And we never expected
He'd mind being rejected
He took upon himself an action and carried it out
Now we die for what he knows<start>Ein zwei drei vier

When she knows her daughter's sad
On the other side of the earth?

Sent a message both bold and bright
Good morning, mystery of life
La la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la
How does a man lose all that he loves
And find the strength to rise above
Havin' nothing to call his own?
How does he find that he still has love?
No more sorrow, no more strife
Always some daylight followin' the night
Good morning, mystery of life

I'd be off the couch and my phone would start ringing
Hey when you're
Stacked like that
Stacked like that
Stacked like that
Stacked like that
You know you can't go wrong
My soccer coach said if I wasn't so limited
I'd be on the pros and all the girls would be into me
Hey when you're
Stacked like that
Stacked like that
Stacked like that
Stacked like that
You know you can't go wrong
When you're stacked like that
You know you can't go wrong<start>Look out sister, well, who will be released?
A latent savior gradually deceased
And you're no stranger as often come to mind
When I'm watching the rain fall
Wondering whatever makes it shine, it do
It seems like something shines, seems like it
I went back where the criminal saved the day
There's so much wreckage around here
Always some price to pay
But I found me a fragment all of a thing you left behind
I was left wondering, wondering whatever makes it shine
It seems like something shines, it seems like something shines
It seems like something shines, it seems like something shines
Well, take what you can find, till it, till it seems like it
Seems like something shines
Like some thing shines
Seems like something shines
Well, I'm just a peddler hustling the street
Blind to the jewels, I've been begging at my feet
But she got the diamond, oh, engaged upon her spine
While I'm in her shadows, I'm wondering whatever makes it shine
It seems like something shines, seems like it do
It seems like something shines, seems like something shines
It seems like something shines, it seems like something shines
It seems like something shines, I'll take what I can find
It seems like something shines
It seems like something shines
It seems like something shines
Seems like something, seems like something shines<start>When will i be left alone
Wish i knew the words to say to you
But i guess i never do
We have gone this far
And i know its not that easy to let you go
And now im trying to find my way out of this curse
I'm realizing the things we need to rearrange when you're gone
So here i am
Saying sorry, please understand
I know im not worth dying for
But im trying i am, i am
(Intrumentals)
Its so hard to say that its over
A thousand reasons will be left unsaid
Its over, its over
(drum rolls...my favorite part!.yeah!)
Its so hard to say that its over
A thousand reasons will be left unsaid
Its over, its fuckin' over!
The pictures of your face (yeah, this is the end now)
The moments and promises (yeah, this is the end now)
All the times we had (this is the end)
Its not forever
This is the end of it all yeah..
Cancel<start>Count down the rings
Or pick up the phone
But she's sure to know
That you're not alone
More on the side
And less at the home
Dust and dry earth
Where a garden should grow
It's your decision now
To give love or just get out
Don't be another half life in this house
Why'd you come here?
What did you want?
You did something right
Just look what you got
You can fake at work
Fake it for friends
But not for your children
Or the woman you wed
And it's you decision now
To give love or just get out
Don't be another half life in this house
Don't be another half life in this house
But I know you've got it in you
Let it go, just let her in to you
There's dirt in your nails
Blood on the floor
You play for the angles
You play what you know
So make your decision now
Dig in or get the hell out
Don't be another half life in this house
You'll be another half life in this house
Don't bring another half life to this house
But I know you've got it in you
Just let them into you
Why can't you let them in
Why can't you
Let them in<start>Keep your eyes wide open, babe
If you decide to take the long walk
My city screams of danger
And you're on borrowed time
It comes from a jealous clock
And you're a permanent stranger
So the last of the wild frontier kings
Is held for further questioning
When nothing's left but death and taxes
The matter of the real fact is
You go through life as someone's doormat
Cause you don't get no sportin' chance
There ain't much distance 'tween a pat on the back
And a kick in the pants
You do the Dogtown Shuffle
Now do you talk the talk?
Yes I do!
I do the Dogtown Shuffle
But can you walk the walk?
Lemme see ya do it one time...
Some self-made guy gets it in the ass
At the local mini-mall
Looks more like a warning than an example
And late at night
They said he used to sleep the sleep of the just
I sleep the sleep of the just after
They said the wild boys go head to head
And like the good book says be quick or dead!
So ante up or let 'em go
Cause I'm filing charges on your soul
It's just a joke and you're the punchline
Yeah, the streets are a million laughs
And if I must, well in, God I trust
Everybody else gotta pay cash
You do the Dogtown Shuffle
But can you talk the talk?
Let me hear ya!
You do the Dogtown Shuffle
But can you walk the walk?
Now purely off the record, man
Yeah, I figured I was gonna go down
And get a little breakfast
At the local Taco Truck
Yeah, my guise could use some refinement
But I'm on a self improvement kick these days
So what the fuck?
Hey man, there was a line behind me
A line behind me
Yeah they always try to nail ya
Mom, God, Pie the whole routine
Well here's a little trick that'll never fail ya
In your time of need
You do the Dogtown Shuffle
Yeah, can you talk the talk, baby?
You do the Dogtown Shuffle
Lemme see you walk the walk!
Walk it!
Are ya, are ya, are ya ready boots?
Start walkin'
Scuse me, but I'm new in town
I was wonderin' if I could get directions to your place?
There goes the neighborhood<start>Its never gonna work
I don't know what I'm doing in here
My inners go berserk
Everytime your voice gets near
But when I get under control
I see you ache for it and all
I get some sugar for your bowl
I got some lemon for your soul
Some twinkle for you eye
I, I'm getting sick of being this alone
They think its not right
Fine
Each to their very little own
I want you now
I don't care how
We're both too young to be sitting around
I want you now
I want you now
You make me sure
You make me live
And that's more than I ever do give
I don't know how
I want you now
So Timmy goes to school
And Janey goes to work all day
But we just hang around
And think of clever things to say
You deserve to get your wish
But you don't know what it is
First it was that and now its this
But there's one thing that you've missed
Together we can find, find
Least we can say we wont be lonely
Find, find
I don't ever wanna be alone
I want you now
I don't care how
We're both too young to be sitting around
I want you now
I want you now
You make me sure
You make me live
And that's much more than I ever could give
And I don't know how
But I want you now
I want you now
We're both too young to sit around
Round round round round
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

You make me sure

A far promesse senza mantenerle mai se non per calcolo
Il fine Ã¨ solo l'utile, il mezzo ogni possibile
La posta in gioco Ã¨ massima, l'imperativo Ã¨ vincere
E non far partecipare nessun altro
Nella logica del gioco la sola regola Ã¨ esser scaltro
Niente scrupoli o rispetto verso I propri simili
PerchÃ© gli ultimi saranno gli ultimi se I primi sono irraggiungibili
Sono tanti, arroganti coi piÃ¹ deboli,
zerbini coi potenti, sono replicanti,
Sono tutti identici, guardali,
stanno dietro a maschere e non li puoi distinguere.
Come lucertole s'arrampicano,
e se poi perdon la coda la ricomprano.
Fanno quel che vogliono si sappia in giro fanno
spendono, spandono e sono quel che hanno
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio
e come le supposte abitano in blisters full-optional,
Con cani oltre I 120 decibel e nani manco fosse Disneyland,
Vivono col timore di poter sembrare poveri
Quel che hanno ostentano, tutto il resto invidiano, poi lo comprano,
In costante escalation col vicino costruiscono
Parton dal pratino e vanno fino in cielo,
han piÃ¹ parabole sul tetto che S.Marco nel Vangelo..
Sono quelli che di sabato lavano automobili
che alla sera sfrecciano tra l'asfalto e I pargoli,
Medi come I ceti cui appartengono,
terra-terra come I missili cui assomigliano.
Tiratissimi, s'infarinano, s'alcolizzano
e poi s'impastano su un albero
Nasi bianchi come Fruit of the Loom
che diventano piÃ¹ rossi d'un livello di Doom
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio
Ognun per se, Dio per se, mani che si stringono tra I banchi delle chiese alla domenica
mani ipocrite, mani che fan cose che non si raccontano
Altrimenti le altre mani chissÃ  cosa pensano, si scandalizzano
Mani che poi firman petizioni per lo sgombero,
Mani lisce come olio di ricino,
Mani che brandisco Manganelli, che Farciscono Gioielli,
che si alzano alle spalle dei Fratelli.
Quelli che la notte non si puÃ² girare piÃ¹,
quelli che vanno a mignotte mentre I figli guardan La TV,
Che fanno I boss, che compra Class,
che son sofisticati da chiamare I NAS, incubi di Plastica
Che vorrebbero dar fuoco ad ogni zingara
Ma l'unica che accendono Ã¨ quella che da loro l'elemosina ogni sera,
Quando mi nascondo sulla faccia oscura della loro luna nera
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.

She had my head full of lovers,
and I can never get enough of you.
I take my medicine,
we all need somewhere to go.
Medicine,

Safety in...

When you burn you're the dynamite lover.
You're turning me on,
when you think like you do as a livitine.
We are all that matters,

I'm a runaway son of a nuclear a-bomb
I am the world's forgotten boy
The one who searches and destroys
Honey please help me out
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby please plea for me
Look out honey, 'cause I'm using technology
Ain't got time to make no apology
Soul radiation in the dead of night
Love in the middle of a fire fight
Honey gotta strike me blind
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby please take my mind
I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy

Armageddon time on the firing line
don't know what they're doing
Looks like troubles brewing

Hitlers in the charts again
You look like a tramp put you in a camp
Join the shower quenue in your dancing shoes
Be the dancing champ of your concentration camp
Keep on movin fast remember belsen was a gas
Hitlers in the charts again
Moving in trance watch the soldiers dance
Bloodstains on their feet scared of everyone you meet
Armys on the street can you feel the heat
Watch the soldiers fall it couldn't happen here<start>Well I just saw you out with another
And I watched as you held his hand
It seems funny to see you with him instead of me
Funny but I'm not laughing
Then I heard you say it's all over
That you never loved me anyway
That the things we have done were only in fun
Funny but I'm not laughing
Then I turned away so my eyes couldn't see
His arms were around you where mine used to be
You would have laughed if you'd had only seen me
Yes I guess I was a funny sight to see
Standing there on the street with my heart at my feet
Funny but I'm not laughing funny but I'm not laughing<start>I remember so long ago wondering
Could we stay this way forever
On this carousel turning and laughing
We just wanted to be together
And so we did it
We left on our own merry way
Into this world alone
In the sand at the sea we lay gazing
At the stars up above in the heavens
There was nothing to keep us from playing
We just wanted to be together
Why did we do it
We left on our own merry way
Into this world alone
Little did we know
Where we were going then
And when things got cold
Trying not to pretend
Ooo...
And still we did it
We left on our own merry way
Into this world alone
How were we to know
Things were so simple then
Somehow we lost hope
Falling to earth again
Then came that cold winter's day
When we ended it forever
After everything we used to say
There was nothing to keep us together
And so we did it
Each left on our own merry way
Back to this world alone<start>I swore it on my life
And helplessly i'm falling, crawling
Can't shake your gravity, your velvet talk just takes me
Holds me, pulls me away from being me, i'm lost into unknown
Don't know what's right for me
Your love is my black hole
My feet won't touch the ground
But i keep falling down, and down
You're pulling me in, breaking me out
Starting to be, all i'm about, gotta break through
Find my way out, from you
You're feeding off of me, my light is your existence, resistence
Forget it, your touch is blinding me
I try to leave you in, i'm sliding back again
Your love is my black hole
My feet won't touch the ground
But I keep falling down, and down
You're pulling me in, breaking me out
Starting to be, all i'm about, gotta break through
Find my way out from you
From you, from you...
Just find a way back to myself
Your love is my black hole
My feet won't touch the ground
But I keep falling down, and down
You're pulling me in, wearing me out
Starting to be, all i'm about, gotta break through
Find my way out, from you, you, you...
(black hole) I gotta find a way
(black hole, black hole) I gotta find a way
From you, you, you<start>My baby she may not a-look
Like one of those bunnies out of a Playboy Club
But she got somethin' much greater than gold
Crazy 'bout that girl 'cause she got so much soul
[Chorus]
I said she got the kind of lovin'
Kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow
Glad that I'm her fellow and I know
That she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me
Cause she knocks me off my feet
There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do
My baby when she walks by
All the fellows go, oh, and I know why
It's simply 'cause that girl she looks so fine
And if she ever leaves me
I would lose my mind
[Chorus]
Yeah, everybody in the neighborhood
Will testify that my girl she looks so good
And she's so fine
She'd give eyesight to the blind
And if she ever leaves me I would lose my mind
[Chorus]
Baby, yeah, you got that soulful feel
Yeah, it's all right

(Go Granny, go, Granny, go, Granny, go)
Has a pretty little flowerbed of white gardenias;
(Go Granny, go, Granny, go, Granny, go)
But parked in a rickety old garage,
There's a brand new shiny super stocked Dodge.
And ev'rybody's sayin' that there's nobody meaner than
The Little Old Lady From Pasadena.
She drives real fast and she drives real hard,
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard.
It's The Little Old Lady From Pasadena!
If you see her on the strip, don't try to choose her,
(Go Granny, go, Granny, go, Granny, go)
You might have a go-er, but you'll never lose her;
(Go Granny, go, Granny, go, Granny, go)
She's gonna get a ticket now, sooner or later,
'Cause she can't keep her foot off the accelerator.
And ev'rybody's sayin' that there's nobody meaner than
The Little Old Lady From Pasadena.
She drives real fast and she drives real hard,
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard.
It's The Little Old Lady From Pasadena!
You'll see her all the time, just gettin' her kicks now,
(Go Granny, go, Granny, go, Granny, go)
With her four speed stick and a four - two - six now;
(Go Granny, go, Granny, go, Granny, go)
The guys come to race her from miles around,
But she'll give 'em a length, then she'll shut'em down.
And ev'rybody's sayin' that there's nobody meaner than
The Little Old Lady From Pasadena.
She drives real fast and she drives real hard,
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard.

I know he's lying, I'm losing my sight
Should've examined the eyes of my mind
20/20 vision and walking 'round blind
Lost her, I've lost her, I feel so alone
Carrying a heart that is heavy as stone
Knew that she cheated, I knew all the time
20/20 vision and walking 'round blind
Just couldn't know her that way that I do
Said "she's wicked" and maybe it's true
One thing I do know, she's no longer mine
20/20 vision and walking 'round blind
With eyes wide open I laid in my bed
Wasn't for dying, I wish I was dead
This is my punishment, death is too kind
20/20 vision and walking 'round blind
I've lost her, I've lost her oh what will I do?
Bet your not happy if she's there with you
The eyes of your heart will have trouble like mine (hey)

20/20 vision and walking 'round blind
Well I'm walking 'round blind

Walking around blind<start>Smoke cleared I never feared
Just rolling low decisions
Don't let your focus waiver
Just be a dedicator
Make you mind like a dagger to slit the throats of haters

Take time, get out of line

Don't fall on superstition
Or blame that malnutrition
Just make your heart like a hatchet to crack the competition

And I'ma ride it until the day I die
This life is mine for the taking
And I'ma ride it, ride it, ride it

Pumping through my veins
Never faded, I got this old blood
This life is mine for the taking

This life is mine for the taking
And I'ma ride it, until the day I die

Dressed in white and slowly dreaming
Stops all time
I slow my steps and start to blur
So many years have filled my heart
I never though I'd say those words
Further we go
And older we grow
The more we know
The less we show
The very first time I saw your face
I thought of a song and quickly changed the tune
The very first time I touched your skin
I thought of a story and rushed to reach the end too soon
Oh remember
Please don't change
And so the fall came thirteen years
A shiny ring and how I could forget your name
The air no longer in my throat
Another perfect lie is choked
But it always feels the same
So they close together
Dressed in red and yellow
Innocent forever
Sleeping children in their blue soft rooms
Still dream<start>Some girls want bright diamonds
Some girls wanna stick like glue
Not her, no, she's a little different
She ain't into things everybody seems to lose
This girl's got her own reputation
Everybody's got somethin' to prove

A little bit of me and a whole lot of you"
So free, you know what I mean
Somethings you just can't keep
She might take her coat off
Tell you that she's gonna stay, yeah
Lay you down and float off
She's a kite like girl, you gotta let her fly away, hey
Let her fly away
She's a kite like girl, you gotta let her fly away
She's as light as a feather
But she'll kick off of her cloud
Got nothin' to do with the weather
When you're wakin' up alone and she's nowhere to be found
We all wanna live in the moment
Always talkin' 'bout the here and the now
New bucks sellin' old religion
She's still the only one knowin' what I talk about
So free, you know what I mean
Somethings you just can't keep
She might take her coat off
Tell you that she's gonna stay, yeah
Lay you down and float off
She's a kite like girl, you gotta let her fly away, hey
Let her fly away
She's a kite like girl, you gotta let her fly away, hey
And if she takes you to the top, don't look down
This girl is not that innocent
And if she's lettin' you drop, there'll be no sound
She'll be playin' your heart, are you listenin'?
She might take her coat off
Tell you that she's gonna stay, yeah
Lay you down and float off
She's a kite like girl, you gotta let her fly away, hey

I've had this lonesome hurtin' feeling all night long
I didn't know I loved her and now she's gone
I think that I just wrote my first country song
I always like to hear those country singers sing
And the way they play those guitars boy they sure do make 'em ring
But when they sing the words I can never sing along
I didn't believe things happen that way I thought our love was here to stay
Till yesterday she walked away and now they're hittin' home
I think that I just wrote
I wrote some words about the good times that we had
And then some lines about losin' my mind or missin' you so bad
And I did leave out a thing about the way you done me wrong
And I sang my song to the saddest note that anybody ever wrote
And I think that I just wrote my first country song<start>Sing your song, words that have to continue.
Tell a tale, seal the screen that is in you.
Make your peace, face to face that is after.
Reasons plain, tears of pain are not laughter.
Cast off the mold, buy all you've sold,
Confidence lost, pay for the cost.
Choose your way, realizing our mission,
Figures lay, pulling strings for position.
Take your bows, hear the people are calling.
Play the game, Take the blame as you're falling.
Time to confess, clean up the mess,
Stand in the white, step in the light.
Use the time, show the face that is sorry,
For the day, questions leading to worry.
Hide your mask, show the face that is sorry.
Time to question, answering all their worry.
Time to confess, clean up the mess,
Cast off the mold, buy all you've sold.<start>Sitting by the telephone
Waiting for what would never come
A chance to be the chosen one is all
But gone

Longing for the love to start
Far beyond the rigid face that you come to know
Are you finally losing patience?
May your [marching] time has come
May you fight for what's been taken
Find your strength where there is none
A message from so long ago
Reminding you that you let go
Why did you throw it all away
And [still aren't you so]
But now you see what's come to past
You're screaming for a second chance
If life is what you made to [be]
To make it your own
Are you finally losing patience?
May your [marching] time has come
May you fight for what's been taken
Find your strength where there is none
No, your life is still worth saving
Can't you see how far you've come
If you find you losing patience
Then just [?] your time has come
Your time has come
This may be the only way
You got
Second chance to turn the page
Move on
If you choose to wallow any sorrows
What will be the cost
If you [dare and] follow no tomorrow
Find where you belong
Move on
Move on
Are you finally losing patience?
May your [marching] time has come
May you fight for what's been taken
Find your strength where there is none
No, your life is still worth saving
May you fight for what's been taken
No
The time has come
If life is what you made to [be]
To make it your own<start>I wanna be out there seein' big rock moving
Get my head groovin', I wanna get high alright
I see the tracks are forming
Stones keep moving, get my head ruined
Wanna be on that ride all night
I did the two ton boogie
And then the bed rock shake
I did the desert froogie
And my head got baked
I wanna be out there seein' big rock moving
Get my head groovin', I wanna get high alright
I see the tracks are forming
Stones keep moving, get my head ruined
Wanna be on that ride all night
I wanna be out there seein' big rock moving
Get my head groovin', I wanna get high alright
I see the tracks are forming
Stones keep moving, get my head ruined
Wanna be on that ride all night
Wanna be on that ride all night
Wanna be on that ride all night<start>I got a number in my pocket
Keep it in my wallet, right on my hip
When my paycheck's steady and I'm damn good and ready
I roll it up to my lip, and I go to the moon
I got my foot down on the throttle
Hands around the bottle, I think my speakers are blown
No rubber on my tire, I'm a getting higher
Higher than I've ever been
And I ain't coming down soon
I can't remember the last time I touched the ground
You look at me like I'm gonna let you down
Hey, every time I come around
You got your finger on my button
Acting like it's nothing, bitching from your golden throne
You ain't no anybody acting high and mighty
Waiting for me to explode, fire in the hole
Look out down below, here I go
You're wasting time
Why bother even coming 'round
If you know I'm gonna let you down<start>Here come old flat top
He come groovin' up slowly
He got joo joo eyeballs
He one holy rollers
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker
He just do what he please
He wear no shoeshine
He got toe jam football
He got monkey finger
He shoot Coca Cola
He say I know you, you know me
One thing I can tell you is
You got to be free
Come together, right now
Over me
He bad production
He got walrus gumboot
He got Ono sideboard
He one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knees
Hold you in his armchair
You can feel his disease
Come together, right now
Over me
He roller coaster
He got early warning
He got muddy water
He one Mojo filter
He say one and one and one is three
Got to be good looking
Cause he's so hard to see
Come together right now
Over me<start>I understand the night's last call for another star.
I watch it fall Cast atop a wish I give, together we alone.
I piece together love's last joy and ask myself is it worth the void?
Half a feeling away the more I scream to say.
I'd rather spend a lifetime,
I'd rather spend a lifetime in the rain.
The more I think about it, the more and more I see
How this misery could be what I need.
At times I often wish you were here by me,
How this misery could be what I need.
On a night where creatures talk, a lifetime's death or a moment's lost,
I think I'd mean the world to you if I could just believe in myself.
As we gaze a sky so dark, I think about my heart that's lost.
Half the shine, and I say:
I'd rather spend a lifetime in the rain.
Can you find the good inside this blackened heart of mine?
Or will you change and follow love's dismay?<start>well here I am, yeah, I'm back again
in the town that I used to call my residence
now it seems I dwell in a silver van
you might have seen it once, yeah, it's parked out front
but homecoming used to be a sweet affair
I'd be swimming to the arms of a lover there,
today there doesn't seem to be a niche for me,
just a couch at todd's house, and jim, me, and the tv.
the house is empty, the shadows are growing tall
against the book shelves and the paintings as dusk begins to fall
this city has abandoned me, it's forgotten who I am
the landscape change its shape,
the streets twist and bend until I've lost my direction
I woke up late to the sound of drums
so I headed downstairs to see what was going on.
Roger was playing to a metronome,
he said it's just not right, man, it's got no soul.
I told him what my sister said in chicago:
"boy, you've made a choice you've got to uphold,
i know it might sound unbearable,
but when you chose to write, you chose to be alone."
so the house is empty and thats how it has to be
so I better not complain, I guess it's best for me,
but the city keeps haunting me
like the house on Lafayette
it was built for world war vet's
we laughed and said "how appropriate"
who do you think of when you think of the city?
well, mostly, I think of you.
you're the peanuts at their city
you're the two way big at Lewi's
you're the monday nights at Sullivan's
you're the underground on Highland
you're the dogtrack
you're the dubliner
you're the forty-niner's shuffleboard
you're the big beer at the underwood
you're the brothers
you're the drug store
well, I miss this city,
I miss this city,
ohh, I miss this city,
I miss this city,
(well, here I am, yeah, I'm back again)<start>The searchlight cuts through the heart of the night
We know your out there, don't put up a fight
If you resist you're gonna miss all the fun
From that backbeat rhythm you just can't escape
You can plan your break but baby your gonna surrender
Baby, you're under the gun
Let it down just as far as you can
Shakin' violation again and again
So come on, rock 'n roll prisoners
Let the music turn the key to your soul
There is no escaping when the joint is shakin'
We're prisoners, prisoners of rock 'n roll, oh no
I was just a boy when the music took hold
Watchin' the stones on the Sullivan show
I was hooked, their rockin' took me away
Well, I made my dreams and I made my plans
Now I'm out on the road and got my home in my hand
And I'm lonely, sometimes it's a ball and a chain
Let it down just as far as you can
Shakin' violations again and again and again
Rock 'n roll prisoners
Come on, prisoners rock 'n roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let it down just as far as you can
Shakin' violation again and again
So come on, so come on, so come on
Rock 'n roll prisoners
Let the music turn the key to your soul
There's no escaping when the joint is shaking
We're prisoners, prisoners rock 'n roll
Oh no, oh, oh
Just a prisoner<start>Divine intervention
So few and far between
Like lightning when it touches to the ground
Answer me the question
I'm ready to believe
I hold my breath before I let it out
The face we show
The one we hide
The hands we hold and leave behind
For all we lose
And all we find
Here while we live and while we die
The wait for redemption
It gets heavy on the mind
And I burn my eyes out staring at the sun
At this intersection
We are looking for the signs
And up ahead these roads they bend to one
The ties we bind
The ones we break
The solid ground beneath us shakes
What it tears down and what it makes
And what we give is all we'll take
To ride along the horizon
When these days are gone
It's what we become
As we ride along the horizon
When these days are gone
It's what we become
The face we show
The one we hide
The hands we hold and leave behind
For all we lose
And all we find
Here while we live and while we die
The ties we bind
The ones we break
The solid ground beneath us shakes
What it tears down and what it makes
And what we give is all we'll take
Divine intervention
Hanging in the air we breathe
And I'll fill my lungs with all that they can hold
As for all the questions
We've got everything we need
To guide us now whichever way we go<start>,

She says every girl in the past is just a waste of time
You know, whoa
She don't believe in miracles and make-believe
If you were blind you still could see
That she believes in me, Oh
Feels like I found a pocket full of gold
[Chorus]
I'm lucky baby
So lucky baby
Lucky to be with you today
Lucky to be the one to say "I'm lucky baby"
So lucky baby
Whenever I see your smiling face
Lucky to be the one to be lucky
Now all of heaven's angels have to wear their wings
She likes cheap sunglasses and diamond rings
You know, oh
She brings sunshine to a cloudy day
When we walk on by people stop and say
[Chorus]
I'm lucky baby
So lucky baby
Lucky to be with you today
Lucky to be the one to say "I'm lucky baby"
I'm lucky baby
I got lucky when you found me
It only took one kiss to see
What did I do to get to be so lucky baby?
[Chorus]
I'm lucky baby
Whenever I see your smiling face
Lucky to be the one to be lucky<start>I remember you in cine film
The sunshine always burst the cloud
The smell of cut grass fills the sky
Just like the birds of mid july
I remember you in cine film
I fell in love to easily
Sometimes we stayed up through the night
Walked through the streets electric light
My beautiful demon
My beautiful demon
Flood lit veins and I enhale you
I'm missing the sweetest ghost
Killed with silence
Feels like I am
Missing the sweetest ghost
I remember you in cine film
The way you ran to catch me out
Do you think about it to
On days like these I think of you
My beautiful demon
My beautiful demon
I remember you in cine film
My beautiful demon<start>We skipped the light fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kind of seasick
The crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned A Whiter Shade Of Pale
She said: "There is no reason
And the truth is plain to see."
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well be closed
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned A Whiter Shade Of Pale
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned A Whiter Shade Of Pale
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned A Whiter Shade Of Pale<start>Blessed be
Messed up me
Should I feel different? Was I
Crying to get my face wet
To discern what I did from what I thought
It's hard to discern what I gave from what I got
It's part of me.
Blessed be.
Low lit theater
Quiet crowd
I'm on the screen projected
I'm in the aisle yelling fire.<start>One to another
Sister and a brother
Changing the way that you feel
Pleased to meet you
Hope I never see you
I'll be at ease watchin' you sleep watchin' you smile
Love I adore you
Always lookin' for you
And I'll be there whenever you need me
Be my Spiderwoman I'll be your Spiderman
I hear our day is comin'
Grows sweeter every year
Tomorrow could be too easy
And today's goin' to be too near
Justice for believers and love can keep the faith
I don't need you I can't buy you I can't hurt you
One to another
Peace to my brother
Always giving me his thing for free
Sad to knock you
Its good to rock you
And I'll do it the best that I can
I hear our day is coming
Gets sweeter every year
Tomorrow's gonna be too easy
And today's gonna be too near
Trust is for believers and love can keep the faith
I don't need you I can't buy you I can't hurt you
Stand by my accusations
I'll come clean I don't need no vice
I know you want to keep me waitin'
I think its funny that you might
Love is hard to leave
And it's hard to never have
Can you please crawl out of your window
You can play with all my love
Yeah yeah yeah
Box up all our records
And a head full of ideas
And a hand full of escape routes
They're going to burn you<start>The days are full of happiness,
The nights are full of gay.
Everywhere you feel a special joy,
Because it's Christmas day!
For the foods and clothes are different,
And the words are not so same.
They are really not so different,
For this is what they say,
Feliz Navidad! Merry Christmas
Feliz Navidad! All on Earth
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la
Feliz Navidad! Merry Christmas
Feliz Navidad! All on Earth
If you want to sing it, do it
Say Feliz Navidad!
Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
And to rest upon His word.
To spread the good news in this land,
Let's all join hand in hand!
Because there are lots of differences,
That work to keep us apart.
Let's spread the joyful news around,
We'll sing with all of our hearts,
Feliz Navidad! Merry Christmas
Feliz Navidad! All on Earth
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la
Feliz Navidad! Merry Christmas
Feliz Navidad! All on Earth
If you want to sing it, do it
Say Feliz Navidad!<start>Some people say
That the way
An ever winding journey through the blear
So far from here
Yet so near
Obscure
Yet so clear
A light went on in my head
Sometimes I think
Many things
Are far from the way they ought to be
Sometimes I gaze
Numb and dazed
Amazed by what I see
Sometimes it seems
A laughing God has played his joke on me
A light went on in my head
Spiders in the souls of men
Spiders in the souls of men
Mice in the hole
And lions in the field
Jackals in control
And dogs are on the heels
Vipers in the sand
Vipers in the sand
Waiting for you
Biting at you
Preying on you
Coiled around you
Poisoning you
Constricting you
Jaws unhinge to
Swallow you alive
Flies
Flies
Flies

We shall overcome someday
Here in my heart, I do believe
We shall overcome someday

We'll walk hand in hand someday
We shall live in peace, we shall live in peace
We shall live in peace someday

We shall live in peace someday
We are not afraid, we are not afraid

Do the things you don't wanna do
Maybe fold that week old pile of clothes
Note to self, get some exercise
Feels bad but you have to try
But as far as I can tell, that's how life goes
Note to self, don't let yourself worry quite as much
It'll end up fine enough, it always has up until now
Something else, you should think of other people a little more
You should've thought of that before
Cause of everything you've written down,
This is the first note that you've wrote for someone else
Note to self
Note to self, keep choosing her
Cause she's yours and wonderful and
Forever is a long time to be sad
And one more thing, call your mother back
Talk for too long, it's probably half of
What she'd like, she's the only mother that you have
Oh and don't let yourself worry quite as much
It'll end up fine enough, it always has up until now
Something else, you should think of other people a little more
You should've thought of that before
Cause of everything you've written down,
This is the first note that you've wrote for someone else
Note to self
I don't know how long I have to keep reminding myself
To be who I wanna be and not somebody else
Just thought by now I'd figure out the who and how I wanna be
Because I still let myself worry way too much
Maybe it ends up fine enough, it always has and does still now
I still need to think of other people more
Yes I've thought of that before, maybe one day I'll figure out
You don't find peace till you love somebody else
You don't find peace until you love somebody else
Note to self<start>If you start here late, no one will know what you did
No, the streets are straight, it's the soul that's crooked
I've been treated fine, I've been treated elegantly
But I'm not one for bathing in the waters of plenty
East is East, West is West
And Bowery is screaming while Delancey rests
Well, I'm south of the skating, but I'm north of the cash
I could sure use the money, but I'm ashamed to ask
The traffic has buried all of last night's rain
The words are all different but the accent is the same
The sun is white, and the moon is gray
And the river is black, blue and green
The young are young, and the old are old
And there are no shades of gray in between
There's at least ten different strains of smoke in the air
And my prints are on them all, to prove I was there
And I love the curses, but I'm not one for the trenches
And I do love the walking, but thank god for the benches
It's hard to tell where green begins, and the city gray stops
I guess the trees all bought their armor at second hand shops
My second had is working, but the minute hand is broke again
I know time will pass, but I don't know when
The sun is white, and the moon is gray
And the river is black, blue and green
The young are young, and the old are old
And there are no shades of gray in between
And there are no shades of gray in between
I know the great ones have been here, but where I can't tell
there's dreams here a plenty, but they're being withheld
And I'm more impressed with the closed doors than the ones that are open
The whole place tells time by a tower clock that's broken
The pigeons are ravens, and the gulls are vultures
And trash is art, and cash is culture
The sun is white, and the moon is gray
And the river is black, blue and green
The young are young, and the old are old
And there are no shades of gray in between
There are no shades of gray in between
There are no shades of gray in between<start>My mind reflects a strange vibration, Into the valley of time
I cannot reach a new dimension, Its just a matter of time
I cannot get an inspiration, Confusion makes me unkind
How can I get an explanation, Its just a matter of time, time
My mind is rife with degradation, forever weighing me down
I can't translate my hate to action, Its just a matter of time, time
Hey can I go, I cant remember, cant remember
What shall I do, I cant remember, cant remember
I know Im lost and disconnected, confusion comforts my mind
I drown my troubles down the hatches, Its just a matter of time, time
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Whats going on is driving me insane
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
All the noise is driving me insane
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Whats going on is driving me insane
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
All the noise

Looking for something to do
I'm walking every beach and I find
That I'm thinking about you
I wouldn't have to be here if I knew what to do
Is there something wrong with me?
I asked this friend of mine what could it be
He told me the tip of the iceberg
Is all you let them see
And he called me a penguin in a palm-tree
Well I'm here in lahaina, I've got nothing to say
My music says it for me
And I try and make it every day
That's why I'm here in this palmtree
Thinking of things to say
Is there something wrong with me?
I asked this friend of mine what could it be
He told me the tip of the iceberg is
All you let them see and he called me
A penguin in a palm-tree
I'm here in the islands,
Watching everything grow
The sun keeps on shining down
On the seeds I got to sow
I'm feeling pretty good about myself
Much more than you'll ever know
Is there something wrong with me?

It started in san antonio
You puked on stage? ? ?
I did when I was right in the middle of singin' easy meat or somethin' and all of a sudden I started pukin' out of my mouth and I just put my hand over like that
Oh!
You didn't get it on film?
Outa-site!
Gimme that in slow motion...
I thought you guys all cut that... I got really sick from ah... that jumpin' around each time... all that scotch and wine? just weird, I only did it for about a second, you know it's just like a little sound-hooker I kinda shoved it back down my throat and went on stage

Back up to their brains to form expressions on there stupid faces

Oh the heartbeats at its peak when you're coming up to speak
And I'm so tense, never tenser
Could all go a bit frank spencer?
I'm talking gibberish, tip of the tongue but I can't deliver it
Properly, oh it's all getting on top of me
And if it weren't this dark you'd see how red my face has gone
Everybody's trying to crack the jokes and that to make you smile
Those that claim that they're not showing off are drowning in denial
They're not half as bad as me say anything and I'll agree
'Cause when it comes to acting up, I'm sure I could write the book
And now that you're more than a part in the play
It's slightly easier to think what to say
You had us all, standing on our heads
Doing our best tricks
Never again
Never again, will there be another one that's as desirable as you
One look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races

I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright
And who's to care if I grow my hair to the sky
Ill take a wish and a prayer cross my fingers cause I always get by

Just to keep the rat in the race

And when she's cold it's the chill of a frozen Moscow lake
And when she smiles is it real or the smile an assassin makes
Before he sends you to hell ?
She's an east end girl
When she sighs it's the sigh of a sleeping tiger's stir
And when she cries it's a storm like the world has never heard
And when she lies you'll believe in every single word
Coz you can never tell
With an east end girl

And when they're kicking down the door she'll be there at your side
They'll never take her alive coz she's an east end girl
She's dangerous and beautiful and proud
With her feet on the ground and her head high in the clouds
And all it takes is one look through a late night party crowd
To put you under the spell
Of an east end girl
[Bridge]
And she may move to the country or the coast
For the kids and the Volvo and the Sunday roast
But there's one thing her posh neighbours can never boast
Underneath her shell
She's an east end girl.<start>Lost in the sky
Clouds roll by and I roll with them
Arrows fly
Seas increase and then fall again

Every breath leaves me one less to my last
Watch the sparrow falling
Gives new meaning to it all
If not today nor yet tomorrow then some other day
I'll take seven lives for one
And then my only father's son
As sure as I did ever love him I am not afraid
This world is spinning around me
The whole world keeps spinning around me and
All life is future to past
Every breath leaves me one less to my last
Pull me under
Pull me under
Pull me under I'm not afraid
All that I feel is honor and spite
All I can do is to set it right
Dust fills my eyes
Clouds roll by and I roll with them
Centuries cry
Orders fly and I fall again
This world is spinning inside me
The whole world is spinning inside me
Every day sends future to past
Every step brings me closer to my last
Pull me under
Pull me under
Pull me under I'm not afraid
Living my life too much in the sun
Only until your will is done
Pull me under
Pull me under
Pull me under I'm not afraid
All that I feel is honor and spite
All I can do is to set it right
Pull me under
Pull me under
Pull me under I'm not afraid
Living my life too much in the sun
Only until your will is done
Oh that this too
Too solid flesh
Would melt<start>Walkin' down the road, tryin' to lose my load
Chick walks up to me and says "Man I feel so cold!"
Do I have to shout, get your sad ass out!
Freaks like you just make me sick, you leave me with no doubt
Dada's always drunk, he's a piece of junk
Beatin' up on his girl, actin' like a punk
Dada's always broke, can't afford the coke
The alcohol will choke, he's a freakin' joke!

Jimmy's gone to school, he had to keep his cool
Couldn't make the grade, they said he was a fool
Jimmy pulls his piece, "Everybody freeze!"
Miss Spencer tried to cool him down 1-2-trigger squeeze
Jimmy's in the jam, why, thank you Uncle Sam
You fucked up my life, I take the blame, oh my oh what a shame
"Wasted, that's what I am," Jimmy started to think
If this is what it takes to be a man, it fuckin' stinks

Jenny's gone to work, her boss is such a jerk
Pattin' Jenny on the butt, he treats her like a perk
Jenny screams aloud, I may be well endowed
But you don't know your right from wrong, you know that ain't allowed
Jenny's lost her job, just to execute a slob
Standin' up for her rights, it's "Goodnight" Mr. Bob
The court was "Fair and square," Jenny combs her hair
Everybody, step aside,
Electric chair
Get a handle on it.<start>I'm home again in my old narrow bed
Where I grew tall and my feet hung over the end
The low beam room with the window looking out
On the soft summer garden
Where the boys grew in the trees
Here I grew guilty
And no one was at fault
Frightened by the power in every innocent thought
And the silent understanding passing down
From daughter to daughter
Let the boys grow in the trees
Do you go to them or do you let them come to you
Do you stand in back afraid that you'll intrude
Deny yourself and hope someone will see
And live like a flower
While the boys grew in the trees
Last night I slept in sheets the colour of fire
Tonight I lie alone again and curse my own desires
Sentenced first to burn and then to freeze
And watch by the window
Where the boys grew in the trees<start>Er hat sie geliebt
schon seit vielen Jahren
endlich sagte sie ja
als sie alleine waren
Sein Herz schlug wie wild
er gab ihr einen Kuß
sie lachte ihn aus
und sagte jetzt ist Schluß
Mit Tränen in den Augenlief er durch die Nacht
und er schwor sich
sie hat heute zum letzten Mal über ihn gelacht
Zum letzen Mal
Allein' im Geschäft
blieb er plötzlich steh'n
denn im Schaufenster
hatte er etwas geseh'n
Er nahm einen Stein
er hatte Nichts zu verlieren
er schlug die Scheibe ein
Sie lag alleine im Bett
und der Vollmond schien
sie hörte ein Geräusch
und dann sah sie ihn
Zum letzten Mal
Sie lag im Bett
und der Mond schien ihr ins Gesicht
er küßte sie noch einmal
diesmal lachte sie nicht
Zum letzten Mal<start>You don't need my Christmas cards
You already have my heart
This has been a holiday romance
Right from the very start
For we know how to spend the time
Who cares about the weather
We'll dance in the town till the sun goes down
And push our beds together
From the land of the midnight sunglasses
To the mountains of the moon
You could never stay a day too long
Nor never come back too soon
And you know what a fool I am
With my short attention span
Flying in the rainy season too,
Nothing can keep me away from you<start>It`s started to come to me
Your new career would probably end like this
All that professional lipstick pressed into an amateur kiss
Farewell to the studied lines and carefully broken hearts
The overpowering perfume and the glimpse of her garter
Mingling with the sweet smoldering scent of the martyr
Well it`s starting to come to me (come to me, come to me)
Starting to come to me
So you began to recognize the well-dressed man that everybody loves
It started when you chopped off all the fingers of those pony skin gloves
Then you cut a hole out where the love light used to shine
Your tears of pleasure equal measure crocodile and brine
You try to laugh it off saying "I knew all the time...
But it`s starting to come to me" (come to me, come to me)
Starting to come to me
Sometimes you bring me down to play reluctant confidant
You say you may reward him if he gives you what you want
But these are days to treasure and to hold
They are much too precious to be sold
You`d probably play the pirate if you weren't so busy digging up the gold
Now you could tell he wanted you `cause you almost taste it on his breath
But you always cheated life just like the bold dare-devil cheated death
Incidentally, late last night your understudy finally got what you deserve
In private she`s seductive but in public she`s prim, porcelain and nervous
Afraid someone will recognize the shame in her eyes
You've still got your dignity or the next best disguise
You never know when to say no and when to compromise
But it`s starting to come to me (come to me, come to me)
Starting to come to me (come to me, come to me)
Starting to come to me<start>Hetzaw!

Consequently be the last one I turn to
Denial doesn't need to be my friend
When I'm a healer that's in need of healing
Is it okay to not know
Not have the answers
And simply be someone
Who is searching for someone to save me
You're the only one that sees
The only thing inside of me
When it's all stripped away
Hidden underneath the clay
I am simply someone
Searching for You to save me<start>Bees buzzing, birds singing
The jack turning off the crown
A lawnmower in the distance
The wood coming nicely 'round
Sitting near the green just chatting
A bad rub, a blocked line
Watching that throw for length
A bias on the garden cutting it fine
"See you tomorrow, Ada"
"See you tomorrow, Bill"<start>My mind is like a video of memories, but I don't know if I'm crazy
In the classroom I would pray I wouldn't have to read that day, I was lazy
People thought but didn't say, I turn the page of red and gray...I'm bolder
The golden boys who got the girls are going bald with no more curls, they're older
Well, the moon is full tonight and I'm going back, tell me where you are tonight
'Cause I'm going back to my school, going back to my school
Teachers smirked but never knew what I had inside and when I'd grow I'd show them
But I realized the other day it wouldn't matter what they'd say, I'd know when
Well, the moon is full tonight and I'm going back, tell me where you are tonight
'Cause I'm going back to my school, going back to my school
You locked me up inside, my feelings I denied
Well, the moon is full tonight and I'm going back, tell me where you are tonight
'Cause I'm going back to my school, going back to my school
Tell me where you are, oh, tell me where you are tonight
Oh, tell me where you are tonight?<start>There's no more wishes in the well

There's no more lies for you to tell
Your heaven is your hell

Ever, ever, evergreen

Ah, ah, ah

Fingers fit to burn

Aim for the stars and hit the sky

Never again the darkness seems to follow
I have no future I just want to die
Heavy guilt mine to keep
Weight of depression cannot rise above
Try to hide as it drags me deeper
Mind full of hatred suicidal urge
Aching eyes count deceivers
Tried so hard nothing works
Crawling towards a fairly grave
Trauma is the trigger the aim you gave
Life so meaningless day by day
Different shades of rage
Cant think cant think straight
I laid on you all the things i miss
Precious death set me here
Fragile little mind blessed with a fist<start>Hold on to me
I am am weak without you
I can't breathe without you
But I can make it through if you hold on to me
When my life is broken
Still your arms are open
Your love can make me new
You are my everything
I run into your name
Jesus, Jesus
I know my world is safe
Forever in your name
Jesus, Jesus
My God is stronger
He won't let go of me
Christ my saviour
Faithful through eternity<start>you don't think the way I do
you've got your own point of view
we don't see eye to eye on many things
even when we try
I find in you what I don't in me
a side of life I never see
so you be you and I'll be me
its okay If we disagree
I'm learning more and more each day
I'm thinking about the things you say
why you do the things you do
and why you are the you that's you
I find in you what I don't in me
a side of life I never see
so you be you and I'll be me
it's okay if we disagree
I've been listening to every word you say
maybe someday I will feel your way
but not today
what I do is what I see
you said when you were just like me
you've grown lot and now you're wise
but I just don't see though your eyes
I find in you what I don't in me
a side of life I never see
so you be you and I'll be me
it's okay if we disagree<start>Only the very young
And the very beautiful
Can be so aloof
Hanging out with the boys
All swagger and poise
I don't even care
What other people are there
I just stare and stare and stare
I see your shadow in the swimming pool
I see your face in the shaving mirror
Time and time and time again
I follow your footsteps
So quietly up the backstairs
And I hope and I pray
You're never going to find me there
Smooth skin and tenderness
Long ago on a dark night
Wish I could see you once again
Just to remember it was true
I want to be still beside you
Quiet and still beside you
Listening to your breathing
And feeling your warmth again
War baby - you were a
War baby - this means
War baby - I'm scared, so scared
Of whatever it is
You keep putting me through
I don't think I could stand
Another ten years of this fighting
All this stabbing and wounding
Only getting my own back
I don't want to batter you
To your feet and knees and elbows
When I'm kneeling like a candle
At the foot of my own bed
Corresponding disasters
Every night on the TV
Sickening reality keeps
Gripping me in its guts
All my friends talk and joke
And laugh about Armageddon
But like a nightmare it's still
Waiting there at
The end of every day
War baby - you were a
War baby - this means
War baby - I'm scared, so scared
Of whatever it is you keep putting me through
I don't think I could stand another
Ten years of this fighting
All this stabbing and wounding
Only getting my own back
But later that same evening
We were out in the car talking
When I suddenly wondered who the hell
It was we were trying to fool
Cause you were the
First one that I ever wanted
And it's you I come home to
At the end of every day
Like a mother-sucking baby
Demanding and so helpless
A little old balding man
All wrinkles and bulging eyes
War baby - you were a
War baby - well this means
War baby - I'm scared, so scared
Of whatever it is you keep putting me through<start>Save my heart
For all of time
If you're going to open up
Well, come and pay the price
And take this love
Take it to the streets
Burn down everything
Till you see it all complete
My body, it moves
Like a shooting star
My body, it moves
Like a shooting star
Underneath the stars
They were fading into life
Love was full of slaughter
We moved out of the night
My body, it moves
Like a shooting star
My body, it moves
Like a shooting star
My body, it moves
Like a shooting star
My body, it moves
Like a shooting star
Star, star, star<start>I always flirt with death
I look ill but I don't care about it
I can face your threats and
Stand up straight and tall and shout about it
I think I'm on another world with you
With you
I'm on another planet with you
With you
You get under my skin
I don't find it irritating
You always play to win
But I won't need rehabilitating, oh no
I think I'm on another world with you
With you
I'm on another planet with you
With you
Another girl, another planet
Another girl, another planet
Space travel's in my blood
There ain't nothing I can do about it
Long journeys wear me out but
I know, I can't live without it oh no
I think I'm on another world with you
With you
I'm on another planet with you
With you
Another girl, who's loving you now
Another planet, who's holding you down
Another planet<start>All this time
All this worry
All this way to go
For nothin'
What's the sense
Of the hurry?
You tell me
If you sense somethin'
I dreamed a lot when I was younger
I'm older now, and still I hunger
For some understanding
There's no understanding now
Was there ever?
One thin line
Draws the border
Between madness and the genius
But no pen can erase it
So we keep these things between us
I dreamed a lot when I was younger
I'm older now, and still I hunger
For some understanding
There's no understanding, now
Was there ever?
And my front brain would not accept my thinker
See? No kiddin'<start>Overseas through the air
Touched your heart down with care
All the thoughts left behind
Soon will catch you in time
Well if I could you know I would
Let salvation reign on you
So won't you push away
All this pain that you've been through
Yeah Sister don't cry
Sister don't cry no more
Sister don't cry anymore
While the scenes shuffle 'round
Let your world anchor down
Pull your heart from your sleeve
First react then believe
You won't always get thunder
To warn you of storms ahead
So bury all this pain
And get on with your life again
Conquer some serenity
Lay yourself in fields of poetry
Close you eyes to all you see
Lay your weary head here with me<start>(Brewster-Neeson-Brewster)
Well I never cared too much about tomorrow,
and yesterday is just a memory,
I never give you back the things I borrow,
but I give back all the love you gave to me
and I like to turn you gently in my fingers,
and I like to watch you light up with a smile,
when you're gone the taste of you still lingers
like the way you're drifting through my mind.
I wanna tell you that I get high on you,
I get high on you, there's no one else who can do what you do
I get high -- high on you
while I never had much time for wine and roses
and I never got strong lines or big ideas,
I wanna live my life the way I choose it
and you can make the future disappear.
I wanna tell you that I get high on you,
I get high on you, there's no one else who can do what you do
I get high -- high on you
(solo)
you're in my eyes when I look in the mirror,
you're in soul when I step in my shoes
I wanna tell you that I get high on you,
I get high on you, there's no one else who can do what you do
I get high -- high on you
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<start>There's a love in my life neither mistress or wife
And she waits for me every morning by the sea
Where the fishing hawk wheels and the sun warms the seals
There she lays at her silent anchorage for me
She is fine, she is fleet, she will run, reach or beat
With a song in her rigging and her sails
And when day is done we will lay two as one
And sleep 'neath the rolling rhythm of the stars
And we sail away off to jericho bay
Where the blue of the sea meets the sky
And the song that she sings me, it brings me such peace
When the seas rise up angry and high
She's a friend of mine ~ the minstrel
There are loons off to port and the porpoises sport
In her wake as she breaks the rolling main
And with the wind in her sails, we will run with the whales
As they swim through their dark, diminishing domain<start>Everything's heaven sent
That's what you said and went
Inside your fairy glass
Somethin' you think will last
And when they crop you like a clown
You got your smile on upside down

Uh, you can pick or choose
(I do refuse)
Find 'omebody else to use
(I do refuse)
'Cause I refuse to come along
And everything's on a whim
That's what you said to him
Lyin' in wunderlust
Are feelings you never trust
And when they pamper you with ice
I can't believe you don't think twice
Uh baby I refuse
(I do refuse)
Uh, you can pick or choose
(I do refuse)
Find somebody else to use
(I do refuse)
'Cause I refuse to come along
And everyone makes the play
With nothing left much to say
They're all in an endless line
Waiting for equal time
They keep screaming it's the truth
And you keep kneelin' in the booth
Oh baby I refuse

Don't get on that trouble train
The trouble train is comin'
It's full of troubled souls
Who have gone astray
The trouble train is burnin'
It's puffing smoke and fire
And it's headed your way
Now don't get on that train again
It's a long way down
Please listen, my friend
If you hear the devil call your name
Don't get on that trouble train
(Trouble train, trouble train)
If the devil's calling out your name
He's riding on that trouble train
(Trouble train)
The trouble train's left the station
It's claimed another soul
It'll come back again
The trouble train's damnation
Is a one-way ticket to the fiery end
Don't get on that train again
It's a long way down
Please listen, my friend
If you hear the devil call your name
Don't get on the trouble train
Don't get on that train again
It's a long way down
Please listen, my friend
If you hear the devil call your name
Don't get on that trouble train<start>Under the sky
You see me walk alone
You wonder why
I honestly don't know
To be alone tonight
To find the answers
What's wrong or tight
Your right or wrong
How can I see
Your right or wrong
Which will it be
Your right or wrong
How can I know
Your right or wrong
Which way to go?
Lying awake at night
Thinking of all the things
I have to do
And things I should have done
Decisions to be made
I see the path
Is it the way?
I know the answers out there
If I keep looking, will I find it?
The answers in the night
And if I find it, what then?
What then?<start>If everybody in the U.S.A
Could come with us to Californ-i-a
We could take 'em to a place out west
Where the good sun shines everyday
Now there's a touch o' Californ-i-a
In everyone who's ever been this way
And when your telephone begins to ring
And the operator comes on the line
California callin'
I'll be there right away
There's some beautiful women
Gonna find me one
To show me how to ride the ultimate wave
Now I've joined the surfin' nation and so
I'll take a permanent vacation and go
To the golden shores of 'Frisco Bay
I'll ride 'em all the way to Malibu
And I'll take ya' boogie boardin' with me
'Cause when we're surfin' it's so great to be free
And when you're on a California beach
You might even find 'em windsurfin' too
California callin'
I'll be there right away
There's some beautiful women
Gonna find me one
To show me how to ride the ultimate wave
In the fifties it was "Hey Daddy O"
Then came the surfers and the Hodads ya' know
We had our woodies and our custom cars
And when we drove around we knew we were bad
My baby listens to my car radio
And when we're cruisin' lets the whole world know
And when our favorite surfin' song comes on
We always let 'em know it's "Totally Rad!"
California callin'
I'll be there right away
There's some beautiful women
Gonna find me one
To show me how to ride the ultimate wave
California callin'
She's still on the line
There's a beautiful woman
Gonna show me how
To ride 'em at the county line
California callin'
I'll be there right away
There's some beautiful women
Gonna find me one
To show me how to ride the ultimate wave<start>Time is the promise
It turns and tells them what to do
It makes them dishonest
They let the suspicion kill the truth
Broken heart, broken mind
When you let me in
Did you not know where I had been?
And love's what they wasted
A lie that makes their dreams come true
They're hiding their faces
Their smiles can break the heart in two
Broken heart, broken mind
When you let me in
Did you not know where I had been?<start>(Gene Simmons)
[Verse]
Born in the ashes of ruin at the birth of your kind
In the dawn of creation you conjured me in your mind
Love thy neighbor as you love yourself
You just can't hear the sound of your own church bells
What you reep is what you get
[Chorus]
I bring you the weapons of mass destruction
E pluribus unum
Illusion
Delusion
[Chorus]
No matter where you go there I am
Like salt on a wound you're the sacrificial lamb
You deserve everything that you get
You're guilty 'til you're proved innocent
What you see is what you get
[Chorus]
[Guitar Solo]<start>I am just a weary singer
Moving through this world of ills
Hark the choir of predecessors
When the paint grows darker still
Once I found a golden trumpet
In the mash of an old landfill
Now I play for the spirits
When the paint grows darker still
Winter waited in my garden
When the sun did refuse to shine
Honeybees all in a slumber
Skies filled up the sea
Falling down on me
Winter waited in my garden
When the sun did refuse to shine
Honeybees are in a slumber
Skies filled up the sea
Falling down on me<start>On the loose, but hearin' gunfire
To time to cruise, leaving for our destiny
Cold hearted city, don't wanna stay
Undeserving of pity, better get out our way
Out of the dark and into the light
Moving shadows, full moon on the rise
I wanna know, where we have to go
A thunderous roar, we're changing times
I wanna know, where we have to go
A thunderous roar, we're changing times
In a different time, a cry for solutions
Fallin' out of the ski, losing control
All roots of evil, appearing at once
Don't dance with the devil, cause you'll have no chance<start>I've gotta hold on
As these days go by
I keep on fallin'
You walk away
I give you everything, that I have to give
Made my sacrifice, but you won't let me live
Love is so green, in a beautiful kind of way
You've got me wrapped around, your prison ball and chain
I've gotta hold on
As all these days go by
Hold on baby, yeah
'Cus I'm fallin'
And you keep on walkin' away
And I can not see the sunrise
You can never tell which you're gonna be
'Cus you're so obsessed, with your personalities
Love is so sick, and you know God is love
You think you're somethin', somethin' from above<start>Two train tickets into L.A.

und auch so manche Kuh hab ich schon verschlungen.
Doch mit dem Fleischgenuß ist für mich endlich Schluß
mein Gewissen hat mich dazu gezwungen.
Ich werd' niemals dick und rund weil ich mich gut ernähr'
von jetzt an leb' ich gesund und bin zu Tieren fair.
Denn für mich macht niemand Tiere tot ich leg' mir
Löwenzahn aufs Brot - Halleluja ...(denn ich ess'...)
Ich ess' Blumen, denn Tiere tun mir leid
lieber Akazien statt 'nen dicken, fetten Schinken
Ich ess' Blumen Fleisch bringt mir Übelkeit
und die Fäkalien tun dann auch nicht mehr so stinken.
Wenn ich auch neidisch werd' wenn jemand Steak einzerrt
ich esse Schnittlauch und ein Omelett mit Rosen
Wenn's Würstchen noch so lacht es ist aus Tier gemacht
nur meine Katzen fressen Kuh-Ragout aus Dosen.<start>Who will take the coal from the mine?
Who will take the salt from the earth?
Who'll take a leaf and grow it to a tree?
Don't look now, it ain't you or me.
Who will work the field with his hands?
Who will put his back to the plough?
Who'll take the mountain and give it to the sea?
Don't look now, it ain't you or me.
[Chorus:]
Don't look now, someone's done your starvin';
Don't look now, someone's done your prayin' too.
Who will make the shoes for your feet?
Who will make the clothes that you wear?
Who'll take the promise that you don't have to keep?
Don't look now, it ain't you or me.

Baby if you only knew
Everything I need I get from you
I'll never let you out of sight
I need you through the day and night, baby
Always there to see me through
Darlin' don't you know I'm hooked on you
Habits I've had before
But never came back so much for more
I need your lovin' every day
I couldn't live without it, no way
And everybody knows it's true
Everybody knows I'm hooked on you
Well I've never been dependin'
and never thought I would
Oh but now I find that I don't mind,
the change is for the good
So don't be feelin' sorry,
for the freedom that I lost
'Cause I found out what I'm missin',
and I'm glad to pay the cost
Now that I've tasted you
I know nobody else will ever do
I'm glad that I can say you're mine
I love ya 'cause your sugar's so fine
And no one else'll ever do
There's nothin' like bein' hooked on you
Always there to see me through
Baby that's why I'm hooked on you<start>Meet me at the mistletoe
You're glowing like these Christmas lights
You're the Belle of the ball tonight
Our friends stopped in and will only leave when
We tell them all they have to
You wink from way across the room
I send a smile right back to you
Nothing is wrong but conversations go long
I only want a minute with you
Let's rendezvous and sneak a kiss the time is right
No one will know
Meet me at the mistletoe
It will be while before the party ends
Another couple just walked in
The night's been great but I can hardly wait
Until it's only us again
The mistletoe is looking so good tonight
Let's rendezvous and sneak a kiss the time is right
No one will know
Meet me at the mistletoe
We're having so much fun I don't really want the night to end
I need a moment or two with you just to make it until then
Let's rendezvous and sneak a kiss the time is right
No one will know
Meet me at the mistletoe
Come on and meet me baby
Meet me at the mistletoe<start>Dope priest prophecy

Who was soon to pass away
He said, "My life has been so good to me
Now I've still got one more day"
Now he said that as he watched the morning sun
And then he smiled my way
Because he said that every morning
He'd lived his life that way
He said, "I am the sunshine
You are the sunshine
We are the sunshine
Help me understand
We are the sunshine on the land"
He said this day is like a life you live
It's never here to stay
Because your time is always runnin' by
Like the sun across the day
But it's like lookin' at the sunshine from the earth
The light does come and go
But when you're lookin' at the earth shine from the sun
It's quite a different show
He said it's time you know
That I am the sunshine
You are the sunshine
We are the sunshine
Help me understand
We are the sunshine on the land
Now I'm thinkin' of the things he said
We're walkin' toward the grave
And I haven't lived a life like his
But I've still got one more day
Now you could say it's only flesh and bone
The life that's in your hands
But I like to think it's something more
Like the sunshine on the land
And I am the sunshine
You are the sunshine
We are the sunshine
Help me understand
We are the sunshine on the land
We are the sunshine on the land<start>Lyrics And Music By Bill Stevenson I'm Sorry I Corrupted You - Took Away Your Youth I'm Sorry You Remember It That Way I Remember It Was True Love And You Can Never Take That Away From Me No Matter How Your Friends And Your Family Tried To Put The Blame On Me Silly Me I'm To Old For You Silly Me I Corrupted You I'm Sorry That Our Love Didn't Work Out Quite The Way We Planned And I'm Sorry You Remember It That Way I'm Sorry You Weren't Old Enough I Should Have Stayed Away I Remember It Was Not My Fault But You Could Never Know What It Meant To Me I'm Sorry You Remember It That Way No Matter How Your Friends And Your Family Couldn't Get Used To Me Silly Me I'm To Old For You Silly Me I Corrupted You And I'm Sorry You Remember It That Way Sorry That Our Love Didn't Work Out Quite The Way We Planned I Remember It Was True Love And You Can Never Take That Away From Me No Matter How Your Friends And Your Family Tried To Put The Blame On Me Silly Me I'm Too Old For You Sorry Our Love Didn't Work Out Quite The Way We Planned Silly Me I Corrupted You And I'm Sorry You Remember It That Way I'm Sorry You Remember It That Way<start>We put tape in the blaster
Got up on our bikes
Had no destination
We just did whatever we liked
Those were the days that shaped us
We hung out in the harbor
Where the cranes reached for the sky
In the shadows of the piles of junk
We spent both days and nights
Those were the days that shaped us
Sometimes I wish, I could go back
This place was our kingdom
And no one could take it away
The fun never ended
On our nightly escapades
Those were the days that shaped us
Sometimes I wish, I could go back
And it was long before the crossroads
Where we could go our separate ways
No I, I can't believe
That it's been ten years
It's been some tears
It feels like yesterday
We didn't really care if the rain came pouring down
'Cause there was always something goin' on
And we had to be around
Those were the days that shaped us
The freight trains came and left
And so did the years
Before I knew it, it was gone
It's new time but we're still here
Those were the days that shaped us
Sometimes I wish, I could go back
And it was long before the crossroads
Where we could go our separate ways
No I, I can't believe
That it's been ten years
It's been some tears
It feels like yesterday
No I, I can't believe
That it's been ten years
It's been some tears
Now here, here we are today
No I, I can't believe
That it's been ten years
It's been some tears
It feels like yesterday
No I, I can't believe
That it's been ten years
It's been some tears
Now here we are today
No I, I can't believe
That it's been ten years
It's been some tears
And it feels, feels like yesterday<start>Dodge Swinger 1973, Galaxy 500,

Hey kid, are you going my way?
Hop in, we'll have ourselves a field day.
We'll find us some spacegrass,
Lay low, watch the universe expand.
Skyway, permanent Saturday.
Oh, by the way, Saturn is my rotary.
Hop in, it'll be eternity
Till we make it to M83.
Once around the Sun, cruising, climbing.
Jupiter cyclops winks at me, yeah, he knows who's driving.

Let the vortex pull my weight.
Push the seat back a little lower.
Watch light bend in the blower.

And oh, can you know what's right beside?
You don't wanna know if the tide is high or low.
If you don't wanna lend a hand then try to stay at home
Millions more will come and go yet we are still alone
Alone.
I know:
I have the right to fight for flight
But oh, do we villify what's right beside.
If you don't wanna lend a hand then try to stay at home.
Human beings may take your heart and hang on to your soul
...your soul
Please don't forget that you are beautiful
Ah, do you know who we are inside?
And oh, so they criticize..but we tried, we tried.
If you don't wanna lend a hand then try to stay at home
Millions more will close the door it chills us to the bone
Others still will take your and consciously atone
Subtlety reminds you that you never were alone.
You must fight for your soul!
Your soul (you've got to want it for me...)
Your soul (you've got to want it for me...)
Your soul (you've got to want it for me...)
Your soul (you've got to want it for me...)

Gone now in a field of green, gone where feelings go.<start>We salute at the threshold of the North Sea
in my mind
And a nod to the boredom that drove me here
to face the tide and swim
(Whoaaaa) I swim (Whoaaa) oh swim (Whoaaa)
Dip the toe in the ocean. Oh how it hardens and it numbs.
And the rest of me is a version of man
built to collapse into crumbs
And if I hadn't come down
To the coast to disappear
I may have died in a land-slide
Of the rocks, the hopes and fears.
So swim until you can't see land.
Swim until you can't see land.
Swim until you can't see land
Are you a man or are you a bag of sand?
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Are you a man or are you a bag of sand?
Up to my knees now, do I wait? Do I dive?
The sea has seen my like before though it's my first
And perhaps last time.
Let's call me a baptist, call this the drowning of the past
She's there on the shoreline
Throwing stones at my back
So swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Are you a man or are you a bag of sand?
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Are you a man or are you a bag of sand?
Now the water's taller than me
And the land is a marker line
All I am is a body adrift in water, salt and sky
So swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Are you a man or are you a bag of sand?
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Are you a man or are you a bag of sand?<start>The picture of her still hangs on the bedroom door
Reminding me of what I once was living for
Though now that she's gone I'll try to go on
With whatever's left of me
A handful of hopes and a heartful of memories
September love
You're all I ever think of
Since you left me crying
In the pouring chicago rain
September love
I swear by the stars up above
I'll still go on trying
To stop living in yesterday
September love

Now she took the kid and I took the v.h.s.
I did what I did but she only did her best
And I'll never know why I let her go
I guess I will always be

You're all I ever think of
Since you left me crying
In the pouring chicago rain
September love
I swear by the stars up above
I'll still go on trying
To stop living in yesterday

You're all I ever think of
Since you left me crying

Frozen in motion, time is ticking by with every moment

Here I am, stuck in the metal with you
Stuck in the metal with you
Well, I'm stuck in the metal with you

Lose control and I'm all over the place

Well, you started out with nothing
And you're proud you're a self-made man
And your friends they all come crawling
Slap you on the back and say, "Please, please"

Now its time you realise, the river of no return

To be born to a freak
[?] expectation from your first crown and peak

Favorite and world

You're gonna get your fingers burned
Watch me closely understand
That what you see is only an illusion
If I'm wrong and you are right
Then I will light your darkness with confusion
Ask me why I don't know
You ask me why and I say
Chances are you're playing with fire
I thought by now you'd learned
You're gonna get your fingers burned
Watch me closely be aware
That all I do is only to suprise you
Every move is sleight of hand
And every word is planned to mystify you
You ask me why I don't know
You ask me why and I say
Don't get fooled a second time
I thought by now you'd understand
You're gonna get your fingers burned<start>I will light the match this mornin' so I won't be alone
Watch as she lies silent for soon light will be gone
Oh I will stand arms outstretched pretend I'm free to roam
Oh I will make my way through one more day in, hell
How much difference does it make
How much difference does it make yeah
I will hold the candle till it burns up my arm
Oh I'll keep takin' punches until their will grows tired
Oh I will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind
Hey, I won't change direction, and I won't change my mind
How much difference does it make
How much difference does it make, how much difference
I'll swallow poison, until I grow immune
I will scream my lungs out till it fills this room
How much difference
How much difference does it make<start>How long can you hold out against me
How long can you resist to kiss me
'Cause you know you want to
You know I want to
I know I want to
You know you want to
But you can't let this be
The reason for a season of love
You're so complicated
And I can't figure you out
You're just so complicated
In every one of your ways
As I've often stated
Girl, I'm not messing you about
You're just so complicated
In everyone of your displays
How long must I pretend to like you
When it's so plain to see I love you
'Cause I want to have you
I want to hold you
I want to always be there for you
So please don't be frightened
By the strength with which
I'm holding your heart
You're so complicated
And I can't figure you out
You're just so complicated
In every one of your ways
As I've often stated
Girl, I'm not messing you about
You're just so complicated

Girl, I'm not messing you about
You're just so complicated
In everyone of your displays<start>What can I say?
I've got no room to complain
Every mistake I made was out, okay
But you're asking me questions
Making suggestions
Telling me how to do what I do best
Considering we don't play requests
It's nice to see you're taking some interest
Things are playing on my mind
I can't wait to leave behind
This small place
Walking crisis
Make sure everyone knows your pain
Keep a surprise not your private lives
To make sure we're all entertained
And it's a shame that shit goes wrong
But it happens to the rest of us
Considering we don't play requests
It's nice to see you're taking some interest
Things are playing on my mind
I'll be here till closing time
I can't wait to leave behind
This small place
Drama, go team, go team, go team, go
Drama, go team, go team, go team, go
Drama, go team, go team, go team, go

Things are playing on my mind

This small place, this small place<start>On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love
On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow i'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo<start>Oh God of heaven come and hem me in
Gather the pieces that are broken
Show me the wonder of you again
Oh God of heaven
God of my hope, God of my need
God of my pain that no one else will ever see
God of my healing, God of my strength
God who has always and will forever reign
God of my everything
In all creation you call my name
In all the beauty that this world displays
Still I'm the one for whom your heart aches
In all creation
God of my hope, God of my need
God of my pain that no one else will ever see
God of my healing, God of my strength
God who has always and will forever reign
God of my everything
God of my everything
And when the mountains shake
You are my God
You never change
And when the earth gives way
You are still God
You never change

I think we will last forever
your the one that keeps me alive
your the one that makes me thrive
I come over every friday night
all these months we havn't had a fight
every day and night
your the best thing in my life
I couldn't stand being apart from you
the day I die is the day were through
your always gonna make me smile
whenever im depressed or in denial
your the one i've been searching for
having sex on your front room floor
those weeks you went away and played
I so much missed being layed
when you said yes that morning
the happiest day I was soaring
this magic is going to last
these days have flown by so fast
I couldnt stand being apart from you
the day I die is the day were through
your always gonna make me smile
whenever im depressed or in denial<start>I can see
No matter how near you'll be
You'll never belong to me
But I can dream, can't I?
Can't I pretend
That I'm locked in the bend of your embrace?
For dreams are just like wine
And I am drunk with mine
I'm aware
My heart is a sad affair
There's much disillusion there
But I can dream, can't I?
Can't I adore you?
Although we are oceans apart
I can't make you open your heart
But I can dream, can't I?
Can't I adore you?
Although we are oceans apart
I can't make you open your heart
But I can dream, can't I?<start>There's a worm in your head,
Squirming over on me.
Leaves a paper thin scab
And you're laughing.
It's too crowded
With the skull cap on. (? )
When you're amplified.
And everybody's tired of the noise that you make,
And everybody's tired of the voice you're faking.
Nobody's counting, cause everybody's fine.
And everybody's whistling because everybody's blind.
There's a page of your face from the xerox machine.
Gray matter, bending, blending.
Makes me sleepy when you can't define
How far you're trailing behind.
You're always sedated.
You're simplified.
Picking off the scabs
From the skin of your lies.
And nobody's counting, cause everybody's fine.
And everybody's buying it cause everybody'd blind.<start>Woe is me, something dramatic like I could be
Ophelia
Love's labor lost, before it began
Im not trying to be clever
Im just saying what I am
Ophelia
Oh, Im turning over will
And Im cleaning up this holy mess I made
Everythings fine
Everythings okay
Everybody loves a fool
Everybody walks away
Everybody walks away
Oh, my love
Oh alas, this has been such a sad affair
Such a sad affair
Well here I go again
Im sinking in my faithlessness and fear
Everythings fine
Everythings okay
Everybody loves a fool
Everybody walks away
Everybody walks away
Oh, Im turning over will
and Im cleaning up this holy mess I made
I want to feel your arms around me
I want to know your love is real
I want to give you all youve given to me
But Im still afraid to leave, to you
Woe is me, something dramatic like I could be
Ophelia<start>All eyes on you now
The cigarette burning, the taste of ash in your mouth
I understand, I understand
This ain't a dream, it's your world caving in (I always knew)
Your world caving in (I always knew)
Strange clouds I'm under
Waiting from nothing, now you've got no place to hide
Our love is a moment in time
I always knew you'd get the feeling that's right
Get a feeling that's right
Oh, get a feeling that's right
Jump in the city
To get a feeling that's right (I always knew)
(I always knew)
(I always, I always, I always knew)
Don't start believing
Jump in the city, hide the voices within
Our love is a moment in time
I always knew we'd get the feeling that's right
Get a feeling that's right

Jump in the city

Well, you can tell ev'rybody down in ol' Frisco
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello<start>You try to tell me where your heart is
you say there's nothing wrong
and the honesty in your eyes tells me
that I should be strong
I don't want to get wrapped up in morbid reflection
because that's a pessimistic space
and the situations I imagine
are lost somewhere in you face
because when were together it's bittersweet
now your with him and I miss you
I feel somehow incomplete
I try to stand on my own
I take it one day at a time
and if you ask me how I'm doing
I bite my lip and say I'm fine
well I don't know
I can't sing
can't sleep do anything
I just know I'll be there waiting
for you to come around
I know you tell me all the time that I worry too much
but not a day goes by where I'm not thinking about you
what we had
what we could have
if you just give me one more chance
I miss you
and it's so bittersweet<start>Sto vivendo da due secoli in oceani,

Still stranded somewhere

Your long-distance love is coming through alright

Lost in the Orient

Turn around in Tokyo
Gotta send it back to you
Turn around in Tokyo
Well I feel like a stranger
In a modern land
Outside the sky light stands like a Buddha shrine
And on the east horizon there's complete design
It's the quiet hours of darkness before the light
The words don't come easy
Lost in the Orient
I miss you
Turn around in Tokyo
Gotta make it back to you
Turn around in Tokyo

Kissing girls in English at the back of the stairs

Because you never show it
You always get your way

Because you never show it
You always get your way
Have you and her been taking pictures of your obsessions?
'Cause I met a boy who went through one of your sessions
In his blue velour and silk
You liberated
A boy I never rated
And now he's throwing discus
For Liverpool and Widnes
You liberated
A boy I never rated
And now he's doing business
The stars of track and field, you are
The stars of track and field, you are
The stars of track and field are beautiful people
Could I write a piece about you now that you've made it?
About the hours spent, the wilderness in your training
You only did it so that you could wear
Terry underwear
And feel the city air
Run past your body
Your terry underwear
And feel the city air
Run past your body
Could I write a requiem for you when you're dead?
"She had the moves, she had the speed, it went to her head"
She never needed anyone to get her round the track
But when she's on her back
She had the knowledge
To get her into college

She had the knowledge
To get her where she wanted

Making lines across the darkening sky

And the waiter at the restaurant sets a table just for one
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round
So I had a plane to take me to a place so far away from you
Eventually we began to see that we could be completely free
And I could get away from you
And you could get away from me
And we could live each separately in our cities in the sun
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round

Save me<start>You like the flame and you are drawn by desire
Watching and waiting in line for your turn
I've learned to walk with my back to the fire
I like the heat but I don't want to get burned
And if you need water
I'll be a river
Like a wave I will come over you
You need someone to fall into
I'll be a river
And my love will carry you through
Here stands a fortress built with great walls of silence
Ready to crumble at the slightest word
Finding the right one is becoming a science
I'd like to scream but I ain't gonna be heard
And if you need water
I'll be a river
Like a wave I will come over you
You need someone to fall into
I'll be a river
And my love will carry you through<start>Come to me, baby mine
And I'll make love to you
Just when the sun begins to shine
On the morning dew
I've been gone, far away
The days they seemed like years
Right by your side I'm gonna stay
Kiss away your tears
Gently I'll wake you
I won't hardly shake you
Gently I'll wake you
I won't hardly shake you
And I'll make sweet love to you
Hold me tight, don't let go
We'll dream the whole day through
I missed you more than you could know
I love only you
Come to me, baby mine
And I'll make love to you
Just when the sun begins to shine
On the morning dew
Gently I'll wake you
I won't hardly shake you
Gently I'll wake you
I won't hardly shake you
And I'll make sweet love to you<start>Take a picture of this moment with me.
Is it everything you want it to be?
Cause when they go to blow it up,
You always fill my cup
With figurines and dishonesty.
And you're rubbin' me the wrong way.
You're jerkin' me around when we hit the club.
Doin' me the hard way.
Always shootin' me down before I get back up.
Why you acting a fool now darling?
Step into to my hand, we'll see some light.
Cause Heaven rents a space in Harlem.
And baby we can go there tonight.
You just gotta come over and rub me right.
Oh I sing...
Save your drama for a rainy day
And just forget what all your girlfriends say.
Before the evening can explode,
You gotta kiss that toad
And activate his charming princely ways.
So quit rubbin' me the wrong way.
Quit jerkin' me around when we hit the club.
Quit doin' me the hard way.
Quit shootin' me down before I get back up.
Why you looking to slow this night down?
You're sucking all of the venom out of my bite.
Heaven is my place in Me-Town.
And baby we can go there tonight.
Ahh you gotta rub me right!
Oh I sing,
Come on and rub me right.
Come on and rub me right.
Come on and rub me right.
Na na na, na na na.
Na na na, na na na.
Na na na, na na na.
Na na na, na na na.<start>My last words to you, I think I might romanticize
Don't think I'd be satisfied
If all I said was goodbye
My last words to you, don't come out as time goes by
I think you said thank you
Or I might have said see you around
But hey?
What the hell's the difference anyway?
I never could find the right words to say
You always made me speechless anyway
Words that lurk me to this day
No you never heard any famous last words
No!
My last words to you, don't come out as time goes by
I think you said thank you
Or I might have said see you around
But hey?
What the hell's the difference anyway?
I never could find the right words to say
You always made me speechless anyway
Words that lurk me to this day
Not much more I can do not all
No you never heard any famous last words
No!
No you never heard any famous last words
No!
Not much more I can do ..not all
On, on and on
No you never heard any famous last words

(Would it matter hard winner)
That's the reason why they join the gang
No friendship, just cause
We just stay the way we are
(...) heroes
We control the city roads
Free wheelin' on the highway
A hundred enjines are racing around
Like thunder and lightning
Can't you hear the roaring sound
Breaking rules getting on us
You're thinking fat, you are the star
(But we hate you, them faces)
You're little houses and (...) cars
Hate you hate you, leave us alone man
Keep your stuff and stay where you are
Hate you hate you, leave us alone man
Keep your stuff, and stay where you are
Hate you hate you, leave us alone man

Keep your stuff, and stay where you are<start>All of the nights when the light was low and day seemed so far away
Darkness was endless and I kept seeing ghosts turn in shades of gray
I wanted to see things just the way they used to be
Don't want those shadows hanging over me
[Chorus]
Daylight, I want to see daylight
want to see daylight that shines all around
Daylight, I want to see clear blue light
want to see daylight that shines all around
Hours and hours in towers on the back road of tragedy
Voices are calling and fingers come on crawling all over me
Then when I sit up and my hands begin to shake
Suddenly there I see the dawn break
[Chorus]
Only one thing keeping me sane, oh
[Chorus]<start>Poor guy that man John Thomas
His woman truly was a devil
And she wasn't all that honest
She tore him down on every level
You're a no good lazy motherfucker
Gotta a shit job you worthless motherfucker
You're a, a dead beat feel sorry for your mother
If I had time I'd trade you for another
He don't like that
He wants his life back
He wants to go back home
He tried so hard to please her
He sold his soul to keep her happy
But nothin' he did impressed her
She always left him feelin' shitty
This is it, no; this can't be all you bought me
Said I'm, I'm high class and this is where you brought me
Gonna strike low just like my mamma taught me
You're a, a low life you're lucky that you got me
He don't like that
He wants his life back
He wants to go back home
Down deep way down inside him
The will to leave was growin' stronger
And he bit his tongue for so long
He couldn't hold back any longer
You're a two faced ruthless instigator
You're a, a low down triflin' Masquerader
You're a, a cold bitch controllin' conversator
This is too much I'm out I'll see you later
She don't like that
But he got his life back
No she don't like that
But he's right back on track
I said he went back home<start>She stepped in the light
Opening night
And delivered her lines
Life is nothing she sighed
Nothing without
The fire inside
She lives alone
And cries when she paints
Self-portraits seldom seen
She swore she loved me and I believed her
Then she lowered her eyes
There's a real thin line between actor and deceiver
She knew how to play the true believer
On the edge of the night
She studied her lines
For the very last time
Life is nothing she cried
Nothing without
Someone by your side
She lived alone
And died on the stages
Of her broken dreams
She swore she loved me and I believed her
And then I saw that look in her eyes
There's a fine black thread between deceived and deceiver
She once played the true believer<start>Falstaff

I still believe it John, we lived those nights
Like we were dyin' on the long haul drives
For our Maria, with the ragged sails high
And the radio on
And I always have remembered, in case you're wonderin'
84 takes a lifetime but Bobby does it better
I still sing 'em ragged for you and Maria
I don't drive nowhere without the radio on
And I'm still here singin', thinkin' 'bout the government
In my old man's shoes, and how you'd understand that
Are you hidin' in a basement mixin' up the medicine?
Every April Fools I say your name
I know your name
I still know your name
And I always have remembered, in case you're wonderin'
84 takes a lifetime but Bobby does it better
I still sing 'em ragged for you and Maria
I don't drive nowhere without the radio on
And on and on and on and on and on
And I always have remembered, in case you're wonderin'
84 takes a lifetime but Bobby does it better
I still sing 'em ragged for you and Maria
I don't drive nowhere without the radio on
We always loved the sad, sad songs<start>No explanation
No words describe
Serving sentence in your head
You murder time
Some waiting station
One endless night
Take the empty trains to nowhere
In your idle mind
And sometimes I feel like the last one on the planet
Only one, your the only one
Sometimes I feel like the last one in the world
Only one, your the only one
Don't get so near to me
Don't disappear on me
Here comes the morning
Venetian blind
I'll do the haunting
I'm killing time
It's dark on Broadway
It's kind of like
Walking down the lonely streets
In your idle mind
I'm the only one I'm the last one in the world
Only one, you're the only one<start>I've got something that I must confess
My little heart is racing in my chest
But I gotta get used to this, I guess,
'Cause your love is moving me
I don't know how, but I lost my cool
Like a kid jacked up on sugar
In a nursery school
You swept me off my feet
And then I fell for you
I'm hooked on you, it's true,
Hm
Now that I know
That lonely won't come around,
No, no, no,
Lonely won't come around
Since I laid my burdens down,
Lonely won't come around,
Lonely won't come around,
Yeah
I felt like a flame trapped under glass
But then you lift me up,
The dark is in the past
So let's face time
And make the sunshine last
Forever you and me
With our song stuck on repeat
Singing I feel like a little child
My hands are free we're running wild
And I am flying sex feet off the ground
And now that I know that lonely won't come around,
No, no, no,
Lonely won't come around
Since I laid my burdens down,
Lonely won't come around,
Lonely won't come around,
Yeah
Now that I know
That lonely won't come around,
Oh, no, lonely won't come around
Since I laid my burdens down,
Lonely won't come around,

Ooh, lonely won't come around,
Ooh, lonely won't come around,
Hm, since I laid my burdens down,
Lonely won't come around,
Lonely won't come around,

Drug I take gonna wake
My fear right now

I'm passing away on
To the better
I'm about to see just how far I can fly,
Surely your gonna break my fall
I'm about to run as fast as I can,
Head long into that wall

Never know how much I care.
When you put your arms around me,
I get a fever that's so hard to bear.
You give me fever when you kiss me.
Fever when you hold me tight.
Fever in the morning.
Fever all through the night.
Sun lights up the daytime,
And moon lights up the night.
I light up when you call my name,
And you know I'm gonna treat you right.
You give me fever when you kiss me.
Fever when you hold me tight.
Fever in the morning,
And fever all through the night.
Everybody's got the fever.
That is something you all know.
Fever isn't such a new thing.
Fever started long ago.
Romeo loved Juliet.
Juliet, she felt the same.
When he put his arms around her,
He said, "Julie, baby, you're my flame.
Thou giveth fever when we kisseth.
Fever with thy flaming youth.
Fever, I'm afire.
Fever, yeah, I burn, forsooth."
Cap'n Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair.
When her daddy tried to kill him,
She said, "Daddy, oh, don't you dare.
He gives me fever with his kisses.
Fever when he holds me tight.
Fever, I'm his missus,
So Daddy, won't you treat him right."
Now you've listened to my story,
Here's the point that I have made:
Chicks were born to give you fever,
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade.
They give you fever when you kiss them.
Fever if you live and learn.
Fever 'til you sizzle.
What a lovely way to burn.
What a lovely way to burn.
What a lovely way to burn.
What a lovely way to burn.<start>I stopped tryin' to write the things I don't like
And I started goin' back to where I'd been before
She said "I don't blame you I'd do the same"
Opportunity knocks knocks knocks open the door
But I think she saw through it
I see through myself
Another chance gone, won't get many more
But I'm not the only guy I know that
I'm not the only guy I know that
You never notice
The only guy I know, well I'm not the only guy I know
That you never notice
I stopped tryin' to write the things I don't like
And I started goin' back to where I'd been before
She said "I don't blame you I'd do the same"
Opportunity knocks knocks knocks open the door
But I think she saw through it
I see through myself
Another chance gone, won't get many more
But that's not the only lie I told you
That's not the only lie I told you
You never notice
The only lie I told you, that's not the only lie I told you
You never notice
The only lie I told you, that's not the only lie I told you
You never notice<start>When the fat man shaving
In the Pullman washroom
Grunts, "What's this?"
Leave me on the moon
I must be coming back too soon
Pieces of pieces laying upon
Somebody's walking on my hands
Leave me on the moon
Everybody knows it's true
Everything is good as long it's stays still
Coins jingle in my brain
You've been watching me through your jewelry
Sending rings around my hands
Now that I'm near you, I slowly disappear you
Your fingernails are much too long<start>When we started out I had my doubts
I let them in
Now I can't begin
When I apologize
See it in your eyes
You don't give a damn
Honey please don't give up on your man
Time has its ways of stealing days
From me and you
Now what can we do
If every time I crawl
Crawl to Montreal
Don't seem like no plan
Honey please don't give up on your man
Of all the things we said
Laying in our bed
Which words will I hold true?
If I could stay the course
My voice hollered hoarse
From screaming the sky is blue
Now here we are again
Both wishing now was then
When I do all I can
Honey please don't give up on your man<start>Can you see?
Can you see, can you see
Oh, can't you see?
You're not fooling me
But it's all right, baby
It's all over now
Thought I knew
Thought I knew, thought I knew
What did I know?
Guess I didn't know you
But it's all right baby
It's all over now
Did we love
Did we love, did we love?
Who did you love
When I was loving you?
But it's all right, baby
It's all over now
How I cried
How I cried, and I cried
All the time
The time spilled over you
But it's all right, baby
It's all over now
Can you see?
Can you see, can you see?
Oh, can you see
You're not fooling me
Well, it's all right baby
It's all over now
Well it's all right, baby
Look who's crying now
Look who's crying now
Do it now
Do it now
Well, it's all over now<start>Another night I sit alone
Another night I my heart is so heavy
I can't believe that it's beating on it's own
I know You tell me to be glad when trials come to me but instead
I always question if You love me at all
But I know You know me Jesus
I know You listen to my cry
I need You to come inside
And I will praise and give You thanks
For You have lifted me to carry me one more time
I will praise and give You thanks
For You have lifted me to make me see my life is in Your hands
Seems like the ones I love the most when I am needing their affection
They're never there and I'm left all alone
I know You tell me to be glad when trials come to me but instead
I always question if You love me at all<start>,

There was a place
Where every flesh was light and laughter
Did not need any nations
All has been one
But you were bored in paradise
There was no thrill and no adventures
So you began to push me
And now you're gone
Way down I did it all for you
Way down I did it all for you
It's said and done
It's said and done
All you are is light in the sun
Way down I did it all for you
You chose a world in material space
And I promised you independence
But you could always call me
I hear you pray
So many lost their link to me
What was a truth is long forgotten
Now it's time to wake up
And find back home

Way down I did it all for you

I'm findin' it hard to give, why is it hard to give
M-m-move along, you're taking up my space now
You've made my brain like a sieve, is this how I wanna live
But you can learn you can fight with the will to survive
Or you can follow on the path of your lifebloods your peers and your leaders
Yeahhhh

Tearing down the preachers
ahhhh
Had enough of Jesus
ahhhhh
Disappear into the ether

Breaking out from the animal keepers

I'm taking my man for a drink, then making it hard to think

Control your kids, they're growing up to praise false idols

Keep slippin' through my hands
And I end up crying, but listen
I can be a millionaire
Honey when you're standing there
You're so exciting
You can make me dance, you can make me sing,
You can make me do just any old thing, and I love it
Sometimes I want to get up so early
And get away from here girl
Summer's gone, and before long
North winds blow, that bring the snow
I'll keep us warm girl
My schemes it seems, are merely dreams
Fading with each morning, hey babe
But this old heart of mine
Is far too proud not to keep on tryin'
You can make me dance, you can make me sing,
You can make me do just any old thing, yeah baby
Ah yeah
So little bird don't fly away
Want you here every day
Don't ever leave me
I'd rather lose both my eyes
Than never see your smiling face again girl

You can make me do just any old thing
You can make me dance, you can make me sing,
You can make me do just any old thing

Reckless and innocent
The open door to everyday
Tried giving it up but it was already gone

The living fortress of pestilence
Over and under
Bow down for resistance
Too many fools have made their fortune
Broke drown the walls and found them crying
If I waited too long
To make right all that was wrong
It was innocent, only innocent

Never casting aspersions
Finding the solitude
Bow down for aversion
Too many fools have made their fortune
Broke drown the walls and found them crying

Erosion
Always worse lit down

Ain't not much
Neither breath nor hope
And I need to know
How to right these wrongs
Give the light back on (light back on)
Light back on (light back on)

Always make that sound

Give what you can (while you can)
Take what you want now (what you want)
Take what you can (what you can)

And no sight of a guiding light
I need to know
Where the road has gone

Always wears a crown
Always leaves me down

you try to leave the night behind you but wait
You hear them still
You always will.
The lonely ones.
Out on the edge of town, you start to turn around.
But in your mirror you see the one who is crying, the lonely ones.<start>Welcome baby, speak your mind
I?m waiting, won?t you give me a sign?
I?m walkin? on a fine line
I?m gonna make it right this time
Soon you will discover
Now you know you?re the next in line
Speak your mind
She?s a prize fighter
She?s the one who comfort me
I can feel we?re gettin? tighter
Sweet as honey to the bee
Soon you will discover
Now you know you?re the next in line
One way or another
Now it?s time to speak your mind
I know you?ll recover
?Cause you know that you?re one of a kind
One way or another
Now it?s time to speak your mind
Now you can?t decide
Between the passion and pain
And you?re reachin? inside
Now you?re talkin? to God
When you close your eyes
You just can?t let it be
Tellin? yourself that you realize
There is a reason to set you free
Now it?s time to speak your mind
Soon you will discover
Now you know you?re the next in line
One way or another
Now it?s time to speak your mind
I know you?ll recover
?Cause you know that you?re one of a kind
One way or another
Now it?s time to speak your mind
Soon you will discover
Now you know you?re the next in line
One way or another
Now it?s time to speak your mind
I know you?ll recover
?Cause you know that you?re one of a kind
One way or another
Now it?s time to speak your mind
I'm gonna make it
I've been looking you [Incomprehensible]<start>You got a head on your shoulders
You get a bone in your back
So you're not a rock and roller
And there's nothing wrong with that
I read it in a picture book
Your latest interview
You can try you can't deny
The animal in you.
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh
Animal
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh
Emotional
You gotta be somebody's baby
You gotta learn to lose control
You gotta go a little crazy
Release the animal
I'm beating on your ego
Until it's black and blue
All that's left to save me
The animal in you
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh
Animal
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh
Emotional
We are both common people
Sharing the same combination
It's lethal
Each of us loyal to the night
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh
Animal
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh
Emotional<start>I scrape through the morning,
Kicking the twilight as she comes.
Time waits ever dawning,
Spooning the thickness out and
Feeding your open mouths.
The price you pay is always,
Too high or too familiar, sunshine karma killer.
Time waits ever dawning,
When you're following the animals around, around.
I scrape through the morning,
Feeding our open mouths and
Spooning the thickness out.
The price you pay is always
Too high or too familiar, sunshine karma killer.
Too high or too familiar, sunshine karma killer.
My eyes are weary now, my eyes,
My eyes are weary, my eyes are weary.
Too high or too familiar, sunshine karma killer.
Too high or too familiar, sunshine karma killer.
Karma killer, karma killer, karma killer,
As it kicked you did it ever miss you,
Will I ever miss you, will I ever miss you,
Will ever miss you, will I ever miss you,
Will I ever.<start>I bruise you
You bruise me
We both bruise too easily
Too easily to let it show
I love you and that's all I know
All my plans
Have fallen through
All my plans depend on you
Depend on you to help them grow
I love you and that's all I know
When the singer's gone
Let the song go on
But the ending always comes at last
Endings always come too fast
They come too fast
But they pass too slow
I love you and that's all I know
When the singer's gone
Let the song go on
It's a fine line between the darkness and the dawn
They say in the darkest night, there's a light beyond
But the ending always comes at last
Endings always come too fast
They come too fast
But they pass too slow
I love you and that's all I know
That's all I know
That's all I know<start>(Crywolf)
Wasting all my time on your smile
Watching all the days pass by
Run away, run away from here
Never knew my lies were so tall
'Till you knocked me out of my mind
Come away, come away my dear

So baby come down
To your door tonight
Blood is pumping with desire
Baby come down
I see it in your eyes
You wanna set it all on fire
Is this gonna be the love that makes it better?
Are you gonna be the one I hold forever?

He sits and stokes the coals while you're asleep
He wants to burn your souls with his fire
Never letting up or giving you relief
Broken bodies wrapped in bloody blankets
But the victory was paid for at a price
Words of peace are met with screaming bullets
Now you're looking through a soldier's eyes
A greater life abounding in the Prince of Peace
He sits in intercession for your prayers
He wants to see your souls in prosperity
He's the only one who ever really cares
Battle worn His flesh is torn and bleeding
Eternal life comes through the souls God's feeding
Words of peace are met with screaming bullets
Now you're looking through a soldier's eyes
Mighty words He spoke to us in Spirit
For He's come to give us life
Share the Bread and Living Water
Eat the Flesh, drink the blood of Christ
Battle worn His flesh is torn and bleeding
Eternal life comes through the souls God's feeding
Words of peace are met with screaming bullets
Now you're looking through a soldier's eyes
Mighty words He spoke to us in Spirit
For He's come to give us life
Share the Bread and Living Water
Eat the Flesh, drink the blood of Christ

Eat the Flesh, drink the blood of Christ<start>Where's the love song to set us free
Too many people down
Everything turning the wrong way round
And I don't know what life would be
If we stop dreaming now
Lord knows we'd never clear the clouds
And you've been so busy lately that you haven't found the time
To open up your mind
And watch the world spinning gently out of time
Feel the sunshine on your face
It's on a computer now
Gone to the future way out in space
And you've been so busy lately that you haven't found the time
To open up your mind
And watch the world spinning gently out of time
And you've been so busy lately that you haven't found the time
To open up your mind
And watch the world spinning gently out of time<start>Listen to me, just hear me out; if I could have your attention
Just quietin' down for a voice in the crowd.
I get so confused; I don't understand.
I know you feel the same way; you've always wanted to say,
But you don't get the chance; just a voice in the crowd.
I don't know the score anymore; it's not clear anymore.
I can't tell right from wrong anymore; I just don't understand.
I was sitting here thinking of exchanging a new world for old,
Like changing channels on the tv, or the dirt we stand in to gold.
When I was young, my father told me just the bad guys die;
At the time just a little white lie.
It was one of the first, but it hurt me the most,
And the truth stung like tears in my eye;
That even the good guys must die.
There's no reasoning, no crimes, and I never knew why;
Even now it still makes me cry.
If there's somebody up there could they throw me down a line?
Just a little helping hand, just a little understanding.
Just some answers to the questions that surround me now.
If there's somebody up there could they throw me down a line?
Just a little guiding light to tell wrong from right.
Just some answers to the questions that I'm asking you.
I keep a vigil in a wilderness of mirrors
Where nothing, here, is ever what it seems.
You stand so close, but you never understand it.
For all that we see is not what it seems; am I blind?
And you sit there and talk revolution,
But can you tell me just who's in command?
When you tell me the forces we are fighting
Then I'll gladly join and make plans.
But for now, only, our t-shirts cry freedom,
And our voices are gagged by our greed.
Our minds are harnessed by knowledge
By the hill and the will to succeed.
And if that's not what you believe,
Would you let me know I'm not standing alone;
That I'm not just a voice in the crowd.
If there's somebody up there, could they throw me down a line?
Just a little helping hand, just a little understanding.
Just a little understanding to the questions that I'm asking you.
If there's somebody up there, could they throw me down a line?
Just a little guiding light to tell wrong from right.
Just some answers to the questions that I'm asking you.
I'll keep a vigil in a wilderness of mirrors
Where nothing, here, is ever what it seems.
I'm scared to shout in case I draw attention from the powers
That preside over our minds and our lives.
When they find what I want is the deadliest weapon; that is truth;
Day by day it's getting louder,
And day by day it's getting stronger.
But when I can't scream no more, and I need reassurance,
I listen to the crowd.
(And the boy stood, and stared at the hill. And the hill stared back.)<start>I could see that the sun it was deadly
She's putting her hand in the fire
Her velvety skin it was cooking
Lily white, lily white turning to raspberry
But when she slips in between the sheets tonight
The memory will linger and burn
And when she look at the face in the mirror
What a terrible sight
Lily white turning to raspberry
(When it burns you rub on the lotion
If it stings you sit in the ocean, oh no)
Les nouveaux riches, when they
Tres fatigue they fly, off to the sunshine
They set jet away, they don't
Get a kick, they don't get a buzz man

They hot foot away, they don't
Get a buzz, they don't get a kick
Man they, talk in circles
They must be thick, a say tick dem
A tick tick tick-a
I could see that the guys were a hassle
She tried to handle them cool
But her interbreeding was showing
Tumbling out on the banks of the old
Swimming pool, oh oh oh
So she buried her fears in a bottle
The juices beginning to flow
But her stiff upper lip it was trembling
Tripping her up, her words were beginning to roll
Hush your mouth, you can't fool the natives
Telegraph, they's going to relay it, oh no
Les nouveaux riches, when they
Tres fatigue they fly, off to the sunshine
They set jet away, they don't

I remember the tears in her eyes
She tried to hide them away
But her time it was going too quickly
Just another few days, she'll soon be flying away
But her memory will stay here forever
A time she will never forget
All the sun and the sand and the water
Such a beautiful place, she never got her feet wet
No way, she keeping a cool head
She got a tan, from under the sun bed, oh no

Tres fatigue they fly, off to the sunshine
They set jet away, they don't

You can read me my horoscope
I like to hear your voice
It doesn't mean that much to me
You see, surely you have to know
How much you mean to me
Fearing my destiny it seems
I've shipwrecked myself
Before I ever left to sea
Hoping you'll rescue me from my
Fill in the blank philosophy
Whatever that may be
Used to be magical until
She ran away and took with her
My five star day
I've been walking with a swag in my step
Have a feeling that I just can't forget
Feel like maybe I should pack up and go
The only question now is where I don't know
Fell in love with the institution
Lost respect for the whole industry
They will always leave you
Down on your knees
Only place I know that
I never want to be
Used to be magical
She rand away and took with her my five star day
Played like a sad guitar's refrain
Beautiful melodies are orchestrated by my pain
Used to be magical until
She ran away and took with her my five star day<start>Si me cansÃ© de cansarme
No fue por notario, ni fue por corsario
Ni fue por amargo, ni bueno, ni fiel
Ni fiel
Fue por ver: que todos la hacen
Que todos la toman,la venden, la roban
Y despuÃ©s se morfan sin asco la mejor miel
La mejor miel
Si me canse de esperar
Fue porque el tiempo no curÃ³ ni una herida
Si me cansÃ© de olvidar
Fue porque el olvido es la pastilla suicida
Si me cansÃ© de perdonar
Fue porque cuando duele nunca, nunca, nunca se olvida
Si me cansÃ© de mentir
Fue porque la verdad lastima solo al principio
Si me cansÃ© de dormir
Fue porque al sueÃ±o no lo sueÃ±o dormido
Si me cansÃ© de asistir
Fue porque asistiendo o no asistiendo
Siempre empezaron sin mÃ­
Si me cansÃ© de obedecer, de ser correcto
Me corresponde ser obediente a mi parecer
Y hoy me doy cuenta que padeciendo tambiÃ©n me canso
(siempre que no pertenezca voy a pertenecer)
Si me cansÃ© de ceder
Fue porque cediendo te vas muriendo en vida
Si me cansÃ© de llorar
Fue porque en las lÃ¡grimas no encontrÃ© salida
Si me cansÃ© de correr
Fue porque muchas cosas las perdÃ­ corriendo noche y dÃ­a
Si me cansÃ© de mirar
Fue porque mirando vÃ­ una vez a la muerte
Si me cansÃ© de perder
Fue porque una vez me desangre por perderte
Si me cansÃ© del culo cerrar fue por el hambre
El miedo a la guerra y a la frÃ­a soledad<start>I tried to be myself
'cause there's no one else to blame
I tried the easy way
But then things just weren't the same
The road to nowhere is easily confused
With everything I tried to do
The simple way was not the path I always chose
But every thorn must have a rose
I tried to tell you
But you won't listen
Everything is not all right
It's time to act amused
Act like nothing's going wrong
You'll stab me in the back
I'll just write another song
Chorus<start>I, don't mind, if you're keeping someone else behind,
I, don't care, cuz you've got something I can share,
Hey, take your chance, even if it's only -
Only while we're dancing in the light, of your second sight
Because when you understand me you might feel good around me now.
I don't want your love to bring me down.
I don't want your love so turn it around.
I, won't turn you out, if you've got someone else -
Someone else you care about, because you, must realize,
My obsessive fascination is in your imagination (now pick it up)...
I don't want your love to bring me down
I don't want your love so turn it around
(I don't what your love, I don't what your love)
Your rythym is the power - to move me
It's something you control - Completely,
I don't want your love,
I don't want your love.
(I Don't what your love)
I, like noise, cuz I like waking up the house
I cannot sit down, I can't shut my mouth,
But when you understand me,
You might feel good around me (now back it up)...
I don't want your love to bring me down
I don't want your love so turn it around
(I don't what your love, I don't what your love)
Your rythym is the power - to move me
It's something you control - Completely,
I don't want your love,
I don't want your love.
(I Don't what your love)
I don't want your love to bring me down
I don't want your love so turn it around
(I don't what your love, I don't what your love)
Your rythym is the power - to move me
It's something you control - Completely,
I don't want your love,
I don't want your love.
(I Don't what your love)
I don't want your love.
(I Don't what your love)
I don't want your love.

I don't want your love to bring me down..

I'm the queen of spades
A ruler of hearts
Clash at the moon
I take my trips right from the start
I'm a sucker for love
Joker running wild
My heart it can break
Ooh it can break
Frail as a child
[Chorus]
Whatever it is, it is
Whatever will be, it's gonna be
Whoever you are, you are
But those games that you play
Don't cha play 'em with me
You're a visionary dreamer
Fool in a state, takes of chance
Love is a hazard, ooh such a hazard
When you flirt with romance
It's like shootin' the dice
Flip a coin in the air
You running on luck
Odds are against you
You're not playing fair
[Chorus]<start>I can't remember
The last time I felt love for you
I hate pretending
That all those things I said were true
So let me go, let me fade
Let me just spread my wings and fly away
Let me run, let me leave
Let me just be the one that I wanted to be
It seems so funny
When you're the one that's laughing
I hate to hurt you
Cause you're everything I should want
That I should be
So let me go, let me fade
Let me just spread my wings and fly away
Let me run, let me leave
Let me just be the one that I wanted to be<start>When I see you on the street, I lose my concentration.
Just the thought that we might meet creates anticipation.
Won't you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you ought to know.
Well I've been thinkin' about you day and night
And I don't know if it'll work out right
But somehow I think that it just might, if we try.
Faces come and faces go in circular rotation.
But something yearns within to grow beyond infatuation.
Won't you look my way once before you go
And my eyes will say what you ought to know.
Well you've got me standin' deaf and blind
Cause I see love as just a state of mind
And who knows what it is that we might find, if we try.
You're walking a different direction from most people I've met.
You're givin' me signs of affection I don't usually get.
I don't want you to pledge your future the future's not yours to give.
Just stand there a little longer and let me watch while you live.
'Cause when I see you on the street, I lose my concentration.
And just the thought that we might meet creates anticipation.
Won't you look my way once before you go
And my eyes will say what you ought to know.
Well I've been thinking about you day and night
And I don't know if it will work out right
But somehow I think that it just might, if we try.
Somehow I think that it just might if we try.
Yes somehow I think that it just might if we try.<start>Sun is getting down
Shadows get bigger
Mean noises around
The air tastes bitter
Pictures start to move
They make bad faces
Bats are flying 'round
In fast races
The moon is greeting me
But I can't see it
The bad spell is here
And I sure can feel it
Creatures 'round my bed
I can hear them mumble
Their eyes shine red
And they stumble
I don't wanna die
Scare me everynight
Against you I will fight
'till the sun will rise
I'm living this hell
Violent dreams
And when it's light
The deamons taking flight
Out of mind and sight
I'm rid of this spell
Violent dreams
Sun is rising up
Shadows get thinner
After last night
I am the winner
This night isn't better
I don't wanna stay here
Why should it matter
My visions are queer
Cold sweat on my skin
My heart is beating
Might have been a sin
'Cause my hands are bleeding
It's been already years
Since it first happened
All I have are tears
And no weapon
Go away bad ghost
Disappear
You don't make me feel any fear
I do not give a damn 'bout you
What did I do to you?<start>You better come on into my kitchen
Cause it's sure to be raining outdoors
When a woman's in trouble
Everybody puts her down
She look for her good man
Lord he can't be found
You better come on
Into my kitchen
Because it's going to be raining outdoors
There's a cold wind blowing
Leaves tremblin' on the trees
Don't you know that that good girl
Ya she's leaving me
You better come on
Into my kitchen
cause it's going to be raining outdoors
The woman I've been loving
Left with my best friend
That joker got lucky
Stole her back again
You better come on
Into my kitchen
Cause it's going to be raining outdoors
Well that good girl's leaving
She ain't coming back
Took her last nickel from her notion sack
You better come on
Into my kitchen
Cause it's going to be raining outdoors
Mama's dead and gone
Father's no where's to be
I ain't got nobody
To love and care for me
You better come on
Into my kitchen
Cause it's going to be raining outdoors
Yes, it's going to be raining outdoors
Yes, it's going to be raining outdoors<start>Step out of the car
Inner-city action
It's already won
It's already won
Charges bring a swarm

It's already war
It's already war

So surrender to me
In this storm
It's hard to see
There's a thin
line between
Love and hate
Love and hate
Step out of the car
Acts of desperation
Leave you in a mess
Leave you in a mess
Americana's glow
Is gone without a place to go
It's already war
It's already war
And I'm looking for you
So surrender to me
In this storm
It's hard to see
There's a thin
line between
Love and hate
Love and hate

Undercover in my head
Voices winning me instead
Triggers pointed at my head

Step out of the car
Step out of the car<start>Dices que tengo el cenizo

cayo la ultima lluvia del verano.

lo que trato de decirte.
Tengo el poder de atraer los rayos.
Botas, botas de terciopelo,
nubes de caramelo,

Nothing for me here
Nothing to do, nowhere to go
No words to say, no thoughts to think
Oh I'm leaving. The pressure building up on me,
The air is really thick.
Can't breathe. I'm leaving.
I'm running, I'm running, running out of time
Out of breath and out of desperation.
Now you see me, now you don't
Can't stay here much longer
Situation I've been making for myself
Can't take it, I'm leaving, I'm running
I'm running, catch my freedom
Now you see me
But I won't be here for long.
I gotta get out, out from under you
(What are you trying to make me do?)
I'm running, I'm running
Gotta get out, gotta catch my freedom
I'm running, I'm running
Running out of desperation
Gotta get out and catch my freedom
Gotta get what I can
See I'm running
Out of desperation.<start>I was thinking out loud
One life's such a short time for love
When a match made in heaven arrives
Eternity is never enough
It's all been so simple 'til now
There's no brilliance like beauty out there
No knowledge as wise as the heart
We all need reason to care
I need to dance with life
Sweep you away into the night
When there is no one else around
I will make every day count
We need to dance with life
Swim in the soul of your eyes
'til we melt into the night
We need to dance with life
And we leave a brilliant light behind
We could lay on the ground
We could look at that light in the sky
Show the moon and the million stars
The stars that we become when we die
I need to dance with life
Sweep you away into the night
When there is no one else around
I will make every day count
We need to dance with life
Swim in the soul of your eyes
'til we melt into the night
We need to dance with life
And we leave a brilliant light behind
It's no secret how I feel
This flesh and bone I love you is sealed
To cover me up and hide the deal
And the deal with me
To dance with life
Breathe the sweet fresh air
And make every second your last
And I'll touch you from the world I wake in
Make the most of the present and the past
I need to dance with life
Sweep you away into the night
When there is no one else around
I will make every day count
We need to dance with life
Swim in the soul of your eyes
'til we melt into the night
We need to dance with life
And we leave a brilliant light behind<start>I...........was born one morning
When the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel
And I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons
Of number 9 coal
And the straw boss said,
"well, a bless my soul"
*********chorus***********
He loaded sixteen tons
What do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. peter don't you call me
Cause I can't go,
I owe my soul to the company store
I was born one morning when it was drizzling rain
Fighting and trouble is my middle name
I was raised in a king break
By an old mother lion
Ain't no high talking woman gonna make me walk the line

Some people say a man
Is made out of mud
A poor man's made outta
Muscle and blood
Muscle and blood, skin and bone
A mind that's weak
And a back's that strong

Well, if you see me comin'
Better step aside
Cause a lot of men didn't
And a lot of men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don't get you
Then the right one will

The one has gone
Lovesongs, they kill me
They kill me... Now
Love songs are killing me

Bull eye shot in black

Lying in my bed...
These whips make me bleed

Love songs are killing me
Are killing me... Right now
Love songs are killing me
Are killing me... Right now
I can't hear the sceneries
Of constant tragedies
Of what I meant to feel no more
'cause I'm already dead
And I just cannot bear
To hear another word no more

The birth has occurred and the time has begun, it's the end of this age and the
preparations must begin for a new time that takes so much work and will hurt in the
beginning, change always does, and know strength is not something you buy or sell
through aggression and fear. Only love and acceptance of faith will convince you
that you're not alone and exist among friends so have patience...
Don't give in...
Don't give in...
Have patience...

become? Is this the way you want to live?)

Smooth as silk, cool as air
Ooh it makes you wanna cry
She doesn't know your name
And your heart beats like a subway train
Oh it makes you wanna die
Oh, don't you wanna take her?
Wanna make her all your own?
Maria, you've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Medina, Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights
I've seen this thing before
In my best friend and the boy next door
Fool for love and full of fire
Won't come in from the rain
She's oceans running down the drain
Blue as ice and desire
Don't you wanna make her?
Oh, don't you wanna take her home?
Maria, you've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Medina, Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights
Oh, don't you wanna break her?
Oh, don't you wanna take her home?
She walks like she don't care
Walkin' on imported air
Oh, it makes you wanna die
Maria, you've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind

Your compassion will be put on trial.
And when stripped of all innocence,
will your actions still commence?
You won't be losing your awareness aytime soon.
Is common sense left in the closet?
A caring mind taking action right away.
Saying, "What will influence you is where you stand."
The truth that I have possessed says,
"How we stand is what I test, "
though you feel entitled to your ignorant opinions.
Evaluate your concerns:
stale assumptions that fill an otherwise vacant mind.
And only lies shall open your eyes.
But when will the world awaken, before it's taken?
Too late for too much.<start>Magnified up close, in pickle jar
Is the last hope the world has, yeah, yeah
Thinking that his head surely would explode
His thoughts go deeper than ever, yeah, yeah
Something never dreamed in all the science books
The biggest light switch gets turned on yeah, yeah
And he's on the way to a real first in all the universe yeah, yeah
He saves the day and the world knows, the sonic boom explodes
Hesitant to tell the real reason, the Nobel Prize is given-yeah-
It's hard to celebrate with a headache oh yeah, yeah
And he's on the way to the real first in all the universe yeah, yeah
And he saves the day and the world knows. Now watch his head explode<start>There's no picture,
I could paint to tell you what you mean to me
And no poem,
I could write to tell you what you mean to me
You're more than fire
You are more than rain
You're more than love
And you are more than pain
No, no, there's no single word
That could explain
There's no flower,
Blooming like the smile in your ethereal eyes
And no scholar,
Ever could explain it ÃÂ¢Ã¢?Â¬Ã¢?? he could be so wise
You're more than heaven
You are more than Earth
You're the origin
You are more than birth
You're more than beautiful
You're everything to me
It's not the way that you move
It's not the glowing
On your face when you smile
That makes me trembling and calm
It's not that look in your eyes
When I am going
It's just everything ÃÂ¢Ã¢?Â¬Ã¢?? what you are
There's no ocean,
Deep enough to show you what you mean to me
And no mountain,
High enough to show you what you mean to me
You're more than meaning
You are more than time
You are redemption
You're the reason why
You're so mysterious
You're everything to me
It's not the way that you move
It's not the glowing
On your face when you smile
That makes me trembling and calm
It's not that look in your eyes
When I am going
Don't you let them live in your soul
Whenever they will try
To barricade the way that you go
You're fragile souls can fly
It's not the way that you move<start>She knew it about Route Three
Oh, she blew it, you know she could've told me
He can't say no, he can't ask why
Go through it, highway bride
He delivers, he's a road sider
He gets no road from a back seat driver
Away we go, yes or no?
I love you honey, gimme a beer
But just like Jerry Lee, she's tuning in on me
And I've got no defense, but it makes no difference
'Cause just like Jerry Lee, she's tuning in on me
She does it easy, like a CB
He's hard to hold on the rolling road
He knows his rig's hot, get through that roadblock
Ten miles to go, oh, radio
She knew it, now so does he
Ah, I love you honey, gimme a beer
Ooh, go through it, come sit right here<start>He's a perfect stranger
Like a cross of himself and a fox
He's a feeling arranger
And a changer of the ways he talks
He's the unforseen danger
The keeper of the key to the locks
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner
If you see him in the subway
He'll be down at the end of the car
Watching you move
Until he knows he knows who you are
When you get off at your station alone
He'll know that you are
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide...
I wanna live with a cinnamon girl
I could be happy
The rest of my life
With a cinnamon girl
A dreamer of pictures
I run in the night
You see us together
Chasing the moonlight
My cinnamon girl
Ten silver saxes,
A bass with a bow
The drummer relaxes
And waits between shows
For his cinnamon girl
A dreamer of pictures
I run in the night
You see us together
Chasing the moonlight
My cinnamon girl...
Be on my side,
I'll be on your side, baby
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me
Staying here all alone
When you could be taking me
For a ride.
Yeah, she could drag me
Over the rainbow,
Send me away
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead.
You take my hand,
I'll take your hand
Together we may get away
This much madness is
Too much sorrow
It's impossible to make it today.
Yeah, she could drag me
Over the rainbow,
Send me away
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead.
Be on my side,
I'll be on your side, baby
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me
Staying here all alone
When you could be taking me
For a ride.<start>A preacher shuns his brother
Cause his bride's a different color
And this is not acceptable
His papa taught him so
It was love that he'd been preaching
But this was overreaching
The boundaries stretchin' further
Than his heart would choose to go
Like an angel with no wings
Like a kingdom with no king
What have we become?
A self indulgent people
What have we become?
Tell me where are the righteous ones?
What have we become?
In a world degenerating
What have we become?
Speak your mind, look out for yourself
The answer to it all is a life of wealth
Grab all you can cause you live just once
You got the right to do whatever you want
Don't worry about others or where you came from
It ain't what you were, it's what you have become
Mom and Dad are fightin'
As Rosie lies there crying
For once again she's overheard
Regrets of their mistake
With Christmas bells a-ringing
Little Rosie'd leave them grieving The gift she'd give her family
Would be the pills she'd take
An inconvenient child
She wasn't worth their while
(repeat choruses 1 and 2)
What about love?
What about God?
What about holiness?
What about mercy, compassion and selflessness?
You know it's true
He is there for me and you
Doesn't matter what you do

What have we become?
Have we come undone?
What have we become?
Have we come undone?
What have we become?

Selfish...
With selfish...
Selfish people
When you gonna learn?
Everyone of us
Gathered 'round in trust
What have we become?<start>(this song is translated from French)
The way that the willow bows over the stream
like a mourner crying for their loved one
reminds me of last fall
when on one knee, I pledged myself to you<start>(Instrumental)<start>We're ready to go
Ticking like a bomb that's about to blow
It's taking control
Pulling at your feet like an undertow
You don't really know
If you're all that capable
But you've been told
Don't pretend you're stupid
Figure it out
Sort it out
Go make yourself useful
You're better than dead
You really made a mess with the words you said
So easily fed
The flames of the fire rise above your head
They want to be led
You've joined the ranks instead
There's a voice in your head
I can't figure it out
Any more than the generation before me
I can't figure it out
How we got where we are today
I can't figure it out
Any more than the generation before me
I can't figure it out
We've got to fight not to fade away<start>I've been waitin' on the fault line
Let the needle take me on
I'll be standing with my dyin' bell
If you care to come along
Racin' with the risin' tide to my father's door
Racin' with the risin' tide to my father's door
I've been lyin' in the bright lights
See my shadow from below
Never wanted from another man
Never wanted from my own
Drownin' in the risin' tide in my father's door
Drownin' in the risin' tide in my father's door
Through a window to the last mile
Little picture on the wall
From the banks on the far side
See the lights come ashore
Racin' from the risin' tide to my father's door
Racin' from the risin' tide to my father's door
Racin' with the risin' tide to my father's door<start>Pull your arms up around your knees
And hide out inside your room
Pretend you can't feel at all
Just realize that I know how
You feel now
If all I am is distraction for you then I can't complain
That you can't feel something for me
Take all you can find in me
Can you think back to when things worked
When dreams were the days you lived
When you never cried alone
Just realize that I know how
You feel now
If all I am is distraction for you then I can't complain
That you can't feel something for me
Take all you can find in me<start>When she walked in the room I was drawn
Like a fool almost hypnotised
You made my heart beat, baby, like never before
Underneath her disguise I saw trouble and lies
But I walked right in
She said tonight I'm gonna make you push it
And that's the score
Chorus
I don't want her, don't need her
I'll just take what I want in the morning
I'll leave her
But she took me, she shook me now I'm
Under her spell and there's no getting over
The black-hearted woman
Now to her it's a game trading passion for pain
And there's no way out
She's gonna use and abuse, take your body
Control your life
Like a demon possessed she put me to the test
Only just survived she said tonight I'm gonna make
You use it like never before
Chorus
Don't want her, don't need her
I'll just take what I want in the morning
I'll leave her
But she took me, she shook me and now I'm under
Her spell and there's no getting over the black-hearted woman
She's a filthy girl-dressed in black
Walk them heels up and down your back
Chain you up, pure desire
Gonna set your soul on fire
When she walked in the room, I was drawn like a fool
I was hypnotised
She made my heart beat, baby, like never before
Underneath her disguise I saw trouble and lies
But I walked right in
She said tonight I'm gonna make you push
It like never before
Chorus
Don't want her, don't need her
I'll just take what I want in the morning
I'll leave her
But she took me, she shook me and now I'm under
Her spell and there's no getting over the black-hearted woman<start>the furrowed bed of sand worries again
as it had before, waves left the land.
for the falling leaves the child weepeing alone,
he's letting go of the anchor and all the lines...
waiting for the fingers of the grey wave
of his mother's hand to roll over him
with endless water... 10,000 bridges
show me father.
now I'm older, now much older
and this wake can take me out to sea.
and this wake can take me out to sea.
I can see her, she is calling me
I can feel her there...I can feel her there.

Oh baby, why can't you treat me right?
You took all my money and you done me wrong
Staying out all night baby and you won't come home
Oh baby, why can't you treat me right?
Oh baby, you know my love is true
Oh baby, you know my love is true
I do everything you tell me to
You won't do anything baby but try to make me blue
Baby, you ought to treat me right
Oh baby, you're gonna reap just what you sow
Oh baby, you're gonna reap just what you sow
Someday baby, you gonna learn that
If you play with fire you're gotta get burned
Baby, you better treat me right<start>When my white shirt lets me down
Like one we race against the wind
You said that I've seen better days
I wash her silver hair away
I'm going to be
(I'm going to be)
In heaven when you say
(in heaven when you say)
I'm too young to waste to ever be denied
(you`re too young)
She laughed and then she died
Heard you said to me today
You're safe but you're so far away
You're beautiful how could you be so green
Tomorrow it holds the cause again
(chorus)
And someone said to me
You've taken this too far
But I can't be asked to change
You're so vain
You're open all day
I'm glad I got it sorted now
Heard you said to me today
You're safe but you're so far away
'cause'I'm beautiful how could you be so green
Tomorrow it holds the cause again
(chorus)<start>All my life is on me now, hail the pages turning
And the future's on the bound, hell don't know my fury
You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need - and maybe some faith would
Do me good
I don't know what I'm doing, don't know should I
Change my mind, I can't decide, there's too many
Variations to consider
No thing I do don't do no thing but bring me
More to do,
It's true, I do imbue my blue unto myself,
I make it bitter
Baby, lay your head on my lap one more time
Tell me you belong to me
Baby say that it's all gonna be alright
I believe that it isn't.<start>Pretty thing on her feet
She's gonna leave them sorry
She's a sweet and sour miss
Too hot to handle now
Spend all night
In a red light town
Looking for a green light
Green light girl
Looking for a green light
Green light girl
All the boys want you
Your glamour and despair
She smiles and rolls her eyes
In a rock and roll uprise
Touch if you want to
She's the girl of the year

Talking about a green light

Sweet sixteen is looking in her rear-view mirror

Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, threepenny pierrot
Happy little feet that dance all day
Lonely little heart with lots to say
Stepping footprints on your mind
Offering thoughts of columbine
Bang the drum and blow the bugle call
Pierrot takes the stage to play for all
For here's a life his fortune rules
Forsaken by his columbine
Threepenny pierrot - we love you
Threepenny pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, threepenny pierrot
To tap his feet to greet dear harlequin
The hearts of folks so keenly hard to win
A patchwork frame of tears and wine
The nectar for cruel columbine
The part of three and leaves the stage forlorn
Puppets cold, their faces sad and drawn
Relive each trial of rise and fall
The love which lacks between us all
Threepenny pierrot - we love you
Threepenny pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes

And left just a part of me,
And look, look, look what you've done.
Well, you took all the best of me,
So come get the rest of me,
And look back, finish what you've begun.
There is some one you ought to meet,
It's me, mister incomplete.
Look, at what I've become.
For it's due to the lack of you
That I'm now only half of two.
Look back, finish what you've begun.
Come and sit by my side
Where there's nothing to hide.
And we'll try to decide what you needed;
But from where I stand today,
I can't think of the way
Or the words that I might say
That will change your mind and make you stay.
Oh, no, not for all the times I've pleaded.
Look, look, look what you've done.
You have taken the best of me,
So come get the rest of me,
And look back, finish what you've begun.
I'll be done.<start>Ando buscando

Vamos a hacer un silencio
Vamos a ver como fue
Ayer un un angel nos rapto
Y nos dejo en la pasion
Vamos a ver otra vez...
Vamos a hacer un silencio
Vamos a vernos la piel
Vamos a hacer sangrar el cielo
Vamos a hacerlo nuestro en serio
Vamos a hacerlo una vez
Vamos a hacerlo una vez

Un silencio<start>I see our stars tonight
Do you recall that light
Or do you ever think of me
And in your world somewhere
Do memories rip and tear
The ones that always keep you hangin on
To all that might have been
And I love you now
And I hate you now
And I miss you most of all
All those times we laughed
The scars that you left
Still I miss you most of all
And by the waters side
The tall grass where we lied
The nights we cried ourselves to sleep
Most septembers now
I break down somehow
Rememberin all we said
And all those dreams we never got to see
(chorus)
Are you somewhere
Without a care
Or are you as alone as I am
Did you ever make it home<start>Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now
Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
Na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now
Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now<start>I saw this old friend at the Eveleigh bar
Life hadn't treated him so well
A heart so gold, and words so blue
In a body home from hell
He said, "If I could tell you one thing, I would tell you this:
There's only one mistake that I have made
It's giving up the music in my fingertips
By trying to get to heaven through my veins."
All our lives
I watched you search beneath the fallen skies
This was no path to glory
You always walked before me
But you came back to warn me
All our lives
I saw this woman with tears in her eyes
Driving beside me yesterday
She turned her head, then I turned mine
And I watched her drive away
I thought, if I could tell her something, I would tell her this
There's only two mistakes that I have made
It's running from the people who could love me best
And trying to fix a world that I can't change
All our lives
I watched you search beneath the fallen skies
This was no path to glory
You always walked before me
But you came back to warn me
All our lives
I remember being young and staring at my hands
In the middle of the night, the first light of the morning
My room like a church, voices down the hall
I barely made 'em out, but sometimes you don't want to know
Now that I'm older, I can tell you this
The mornings I miss, but I don't really miss the voices
You've got a choice, I've got the hands
Skeletons and plans, you've got to let 'em go
All our lives
I watched you search beneath the fallen skies
All our lives
I watched you search beneath the fallen skies
This was no path to glory
You always walked before me
But you came back to warn me
All our lives
All our lives
I watched you search beneath the fallen skies
This was no path to glory
You always walked before me
But you came back to warn me
All our lives<start>[instrumental]<start>Crack the Heart with true Intension
Blood and scars and no rejections

We got nothing to take on

We go back where we belong
Where wasted ways amount to nothing
But your opinions keep on coming
Were dead inside in your rejection
Well risk it all and did I mention
Ill say it again

And he won't be my last
My hunger and my thirst
My brilliant future
And my ugly past

My blessing and my curse

Until my work is done

Catch me, catch me when you can
I can't control myself
You won't have a clue
Of what is coming next
What I'm gonna do

Which limb will I choose?
Which one gets sawn in half?
Which leg would you lose?

Catch me, catch me if you can
I wrestled with the devil and I'll do it again
Catch me, catch me when you can

We thought we were invincible
We probably made no sense at all
Oh
And we belonged
Wherever we wanted to be
No one could tell us anything
Oh
I'm not the type to stay cold in the winter
But I know we had something special, my dear
We all had our struggle but faith kept us strong
And we always knew we would end up right here
Sometimes I wish we could go back
You remind me of
Cinnamon and lipstick
And the summers that we kicked it
And the late nights that we stayed up
Singing our favorite songs
In my beat up old apartment
We were broke and we were starving
But it's nights like that
That we will never forget again
We were strong
We thought we had the ever-glow
It felt so irresistible
Oh
We prolonged
That some day we would have to leave
No one could make us not believe
Oh
I'm not the type to stay cold in the winter
But I know we had something special, my dear
We all had our struggle but faith kept us strong
And we always knew we would end up right here
Sometimes I wish we could go back

And the summers that we kicked it
And the late nights that we stayed up
Singing our favorite songs
In my beat up old apartment
We were broke and we were starving
But it's nights like that
That we will never forget again
I know that there's nothing better than this
But please know that in my heart you will be missed
All we can do is make new memories
We can still change the world if we believe
Sometimes I wish we could go back
You remind me of
Cinnamon and lipstick
And the summers that we kicked it
And the late nights that we stayed up
Singing our favorite songs
In my beat up old apartment

It really gets under my skin
You say it's easy when it's faster
I still can't guess what you're after
It's the color of your skin
Your skin is black metallic
It's the color of your skin
Your skin is black metallic
Your skin is black metallic
Your skin is black metallic
I think of you when you're sleeping
Of all the secrets that you're keeping
You can't stay all day under the covers
'Cause under there you'll discover
It's the color of your skin
Your skin is black metallic
It's the color of your skin
Your skin is black metallic

You see, I've been in a bad way
A disconnect from my heart to my tongue
You see, I've been in a bad way
I talk, talk but only hurt the ones that I care about the most
I talk, talk but only push away the things I keep close
I'm going to knock on the door
With my shoulder to the frame
Let me in
Leave the light on the porch
With my shoulder to the frame
I'll make it back somehow, someway
Let me in
I only see the things I want to change
I feel like I am falling
Face to face with my own excuses
I always find the exit to escape
I want, want to make those around me proud
Proud of who I am
Fall, fall asleep soundly, wake up and start again
Hold my tongue just to confess
I'm nowhere near my best
Hold my tongue just to confess
I'm getting closer all the time
All alone is no reason to be scared
I need broken bones and honest air<start>The storm is raging,
Winds are howling,
The water's calling, rescue you,
A flash of lightning,
At times a frightening,
A wind is coming, and the sun don't shine,
Rainy day, May day,
May day, stormy rain day,
Rain day, May day,
May day, stormy rain day,
Stormy May day,
The sky is darkening,
The dogs are barking,
A call for help you hope they get you through,
A clap of thunder,
A split us under,
The people running, and the moon doth rise,
Rain day, May day,
May day, stormy rain day,
Rain day, May day, rain day, stormy May day,
Rain day, May day, rain day, stormy May day<start>(instrumental)<start>I lost my heart to infatuation
You can't cure that with a vaccination
A bad blood is pumping through my veins
I can't slow down, livin' life in the fast lane
Your body language, it's telepathic
I'm caught up in the middle of a two-way traffic
Wondering if this is the impossible dream
Or whether we could make such a beautiful team
I don't know what to do when I get this feeling
I don't know what it is but it stops me breathin'
A little white lie that you got to believe in
Don't know what it is but it's ten times bigger than love
Intoxicated till I can't feel a thing
I feed my thirst on your unchained adrenaline
My body's shakin' like a man on the run
You blow my mind like sex and machine guns
I got scars and bloody knuckles
Diggin' for a diamond in a whole lotta trouble
You detonate me like a nuclear bomb
Wiped out and sleepin' with the TV on
I don't know what to do when I get this feeling
I don't know what it is but it stops me breathin'
A little white lie that you got to believe in
Don't know what it is but it's ten times bigger than
Love is love, it ain't always right
Make you sweat, keep you up all night
Walkin' in with your eyes wide open
You're looking out on a lost horizon
Always something to knock you over
And make you feel like you're getting nowhere
If you can't stand up when you're on your knees
Then close your eyes and float up to the breeze
I've lost my heart but, hey, you can keep it
'Cause it ain't no good at keeping a secret
It's got me doing things that I'd never do
Another fine mess that it's gotten me into
I don't know what to do when I get this feeling
I don't know what it is but it stops me breathin'
A little white lie that you got to believe in
Don't know what it is, I don't know what it is
I don't know what to do when I get this feeling
I don't know what it is but it stops me breathin'
A little white lie that you got to believe in
Don't know what it is but it's ten times bigger than love<start>They're picking up the prisoners
and putting them in a pen
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
Rebels have been rebels since I don't know when
And all she wants to do is dance
Molotov cocktail, the local drink
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
They mix them up right in the kitchen sink
And all she wants to do is dance
Crazy people walking around with blood in their eyes
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
Wild-eyed pistol wavers who ain't afraid to die
And all she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
She can't feel the heat coming off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
Well the goverment, bugged the men's room
In the local disco lounge
All she wants to do is dance, dance
To keep the boys from selling
All the weapons they can scrounge
All she wants to do is dance
But that don't keep the boys
From making a buck or two
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
They still can sell the army
All the drugs that they can do
And all she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
Well, we barely made the airport
For the last plane out
As we taxied down the runway
I could hear the people shout, they said,
"Don't come back here, Yankee."
But if I ever do,
I'll bring more money
Cause all she wants to do is dance
And make romance
Nevermind the heat
Coming off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
All she wants to do is dance<start>Something I forgot that I used to know
Keeps on coming back around.
Somewhere in the dark right before the dawn
Like a light from down the hall.
Suddenly some old familiar music
Songs I know I've never heard before.
I gotta play along I can't refuse it
I hear the call.
We've all been so proud of our blindness
No kindness to share
[Chorus]
I used to cry for the lost
Until I had to turn away.
Then I looked inside, past the fool,
And found some deeper words to say
To bring us together.
We can make it better
We can make it right.
We hide behind the veil of our own success,
While we're following the rules.
Our eyes refuse to see past our little hands
To the never changing truth.
Freedom needs to speak a little louder,
Justice needs to try her other arm.
Some of us could push a little harder
To sound the alarm.
And I see children marching
And I hear the drums again
I used to cry for the lost
Until I had to turn away.
Then I looked inside, past the fool,
And found some deeper words to say.
If we hope and pray,
It will come, give it half a chance.
Everyone, understand
In our hearts and our mind,
You know there's nothing left to hide,
We're already there.
I used to cry.
Cry for the lost I was walking away.
I used to try to find a reason.
Then I looked inside,
I used to mind every time I was walking away,
I gotta find what I'm feeling
To bring us together.
[Chorus: Repeats till fade]<start>Curles and combs just drive me out of my mind
Oh you sure look bad when I leave you in the morning time
And I ask myself each morning when I see you in the light
Is it the girl that I was with last night
Picking up clothes that you piled up in the den
Guess you'll never learn which room your closet's in
And the stormball hit the bathroom and sure left there awful mess
I don't see how a man can do all best
But we're the greatest lovers in the world
Oh I'm a heavy man and I'm a lucky girl
Come up the end of the day Prince Charming's on his way
And I find my princess waiting at the door
We're the greatest lovers in the world
Oh I'm a heavy man and I'm a lucky girl
We prove it every night when we hold each other tight
That we're the greatest lovers in the world
O we just got to be the greatest
Oh there's no doubt that we're the greatest
Yes we're the greatest lovers in the world<start>[Chorus]
Sitting on a bar stool
Acting like a dern fool
That's what I'm a doin' today
I'm sittin' here drinkin'
Tryin' to keep a thinking I'm crusin' my troubles away
Well now I couldn't make her stay
Well dog gone her anyway
She can't say that I didn't try-hi-hi
Poor me another one I'm finished with the other one
I'm drinkin' my baby goodbye
Every time we disagree she was always asking me
Are you a man or a mouse?
Now that she's gone she probably thinks that I'm home just a moping around the house
She probably thinks that she's the one thing I just couldn't get along without
Well wouldn't this surprise her
I gotta sympathize her as long as these bottles hold out
Well I'm a
[Chorus]
Every time I tried to sit down and talk with her it always ended up in a fuss
I tried to reason with her right up till the time that she got on that Grayhound bus
It'd be better if I just forget if 'cause she sure forgot about me
And if it takes all night I'm gonna do it right
I'm gonna sit here till I can't see
Well I'm a
[Chorus]
Well I'm a

I said to pour me another one I'm finished with the other one.
I'm drinking my baby goodbye
I said to pour me another one I'm finished with the other one.
I'm drinking my baby goodbye<start>Night falls on the city, baby feels the beat
Slick and sexy angel of the street
The queen of all the night birds watch her when she walks
She don't say nothing but, baby makes her blue jeans talk
Baby makes her blue jeans, yes she makes her blue jeans talk
Baby makes her blue jeans, yes she makes her blue jeans talk
You know what she's thinking about and it turns you inside out
She don't say nothing but, baby makes her blue jeans talk
Night time in the city, magic in the air
The action starts at midnight, she'll be there
The queen of all the night birds, a player in the dark
She don't say nothing but, baby makes her blue jeans talk
Baby makes her blue jeans, yes she makes her blue jeans talk
Baby makes her blue jeans, yes she makes her blue jeans talk
You know what she's thinking about and it turns you inside out
She don't say nothing but, baby makes her blue jeans talk

She's a modern girl in a modern world
Where only the strong can survive.
Too many dreams have been laid at her door,
But the modern girl will ride on, oh oh oh.
Where would you fit in the scheme of her day
And where could you fit in her heart?
Trying to be small will get you nowhere at all,
But the modern girl will ride on, oh oh oh.
Don't throw your love away.
Don't throw your love away.
Don't throw your love away.
Don't throw your love away.
She moves through your life like a warm summer breeze,
And nothing will stand in her way.
The sound of her voice brings your heart to its knees,
But the modern girl will ride on, oh oh oh.<start>The little people in my head
They push me down and make me mad
I can't stand the way they look
Some blue meanie stole my books
But I'm okay some bad days
Make no sense till they go away
Mailman runs from my dog
Hoping his day is better than mine
Well he better run faster
A giant pigeon eating at my brain
Catastrophe in the sewer drain
Philosophy as to what seems smart
They bought their wisdom right at kmart
But I'm okay such great minds
Join their forces to stop mankind
But I don't know seems so weird
I hope it will figure itself out soon
Well it better figure faster
Sick of feelings I just hate
Blue the color in my way
I must be special because they told me I was
But they flipped out when I said Elvis lives
I could of swore I saw him hanging out
With those great teachers of the modern thought
But I'm okay some strange days
Make no sense till they go away<start>Did you get what you wanted when you told me goodbye?
Did you get what you thought you needed to make a grown man cry?
Now there's a hungry look inside your eyes,
And there's a shiver I've felt between your thighs
And I've been good and kind, sweet and nice for way too long.
I'm gonna be bad,
And it's gonna feel good.
I'm gonna do everything your mother said we never should.
I'm gonna be bad, and I'll wanna do wrong,
And you're gonna be every broken heart inside my every song.
Was it really as easy as you made it seem?
I never heard you raise your voice.
You never heard me scream.
But when you tuck yourself in bed at night
And read a book alone by candle light,
Do you wonder what I just might be getting into.
I'm gonna be bad,
And it's gonna feel good.
I'm gonna do everything your mother said we never should.
I'm gonna be bad.
I wanna be cruel.
I'm gonna try everything they taught me down in Catholic school.
'cause if you want to see the brand new me,
Just look at the brand new you...
I'm gonna be bad every time I think about you,
Every time I think about you.
Every time I think about you,
I'm gonna be bad.<start>Ik moet lachen als ze langskomt
Met haar roodgestifte mond
Met haar roodgelakte nagels
En haar strakgerokte kont
Ik moet zuchten van haar schoonheid
Oogverblindend, dag en nacht
Ik bezwijk onder haar knipoog
En de blik waarmee ze lacht
Ze heeft de duivel in het bloed
Ze heeft de duivel in het bloed
En ik hou van wat ze doet
Ze heeft de duivel in het bloed
Ik moet zwemmen in de ogen
Die ze telkens op me richt
En ik voel mijn knieen knikken
En ik ben alweer gezwicht
Ik moet denken aan rivalen
Als ik ergens op haar wacht
En ik walg van zatte kerels
En de grap waarom ze lacht
Ze heeft de duivel in het bloed
Ze heeft de duivel in het bloed
En ik hou van wat ze doet
Ze heeft de duivel in het bloed
Ze doet me goed, ze geeft me vuur
En ik moet iedere dag
En ieder uur en elk moment...
Lachen om haar schoonheid
Oogverblinden, hard en zacht
En ik val voor al haar charmes
En haar allerzwakste kracht
Ze heeft de duivel in het bloed
Ze heeft de duivel in het bloed
En ik hou van wat ze doet
Ze heeft de duivel in het bloed (2x)<start>Where do I begin?
To tell the story of how greater love can be
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start?
With her first hello
She gave a meaning to this empty world of mine
They'll never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart
She fills my heart
With very special things
With angel songs
With wild imaginings
She fills my soul
With so much love
That anywhere I go
I'm never lonely
With her alone
Who could be lonely
I reach for her hand
It's always there<start>I walked in you walked out
i knew right then something was up
ya said 'don't ask me no questions won't tell ya no lies'
it comes as such a surprise
think I'll close my eyes to the pain
'cause tonight i don't wanna know where you've been
so won't you lie to me
then i can't be mistaken
swear that you will lie to me
i don't wanna hear my heart breakin'
tell me the things that i wanna hear
i don't give a damn if you ain't sincere
baby just swear (baby just swear)
swear that you'll lie to me
you walked in - i walked out
baby this ain't what - we've been about
if i touched your hand - would ya pull it away
was it something i didn't say
i forgive ya all - the same
but tonight i don't wanna know where you've been
(chorus)
you can't say the things you want
i won't let ya tell the truth
'cause i don't (cuz i don't) give a damn (give a damn)
and I don't (and i don't) wanna know where you've been.<start>Blues shadows fallin', since my baby went away
Blues shadows fallin', since my baby went away
You know the blues is my companion, every night and every day
The blues walked in this morning, when my baby said goodbye
The blues walked in this morning, when my baby said goodbye
I wish I could change her mind, but I know it's no use for me to try
Yes will you talk to me baby, if it's just by the telephone
Won't you please talk to me baby, if it's just by the telephone
Let me tell you how I miss you baby and how it feels to be alone
So brother, if you got a good woman, man, you better take my advice
Say, if you got a good woman, man, you better take my advice
You better treat her like an angel and keep her home at any price<start>Built to land hard
That's exactly where we left it
Slippery downslide
And you could never fake it
I apologize, so excuse me
Slow we pacify
Come in full swing
Silence
Maybe it'll seem like it's gone
Vacant
Knowing what you want when you can't
Balance
I could never stress it enough
Of all the right choices
I start with the wrong ones
Still falling, reckless and on again
Rumor mills got me locked in
Killing time, just hope it doesn't kill me
What is free?
What is free when you won't stop watching me?
Everything I do is adding up
Now I'm taking the warning
Everywhere I go...
I can't avoid it, but I can control it
Everything I do... I can't avoid it
Everywhere I go...
I can't avoid it, but I can control it.<start>I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh
I want to hold you high and steal your pain away
I keep your photograph, and I know it serves me well
I want to hold you high and steal your pain
'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you've gone away
You've gone away,
You don't feel me here anymore
The worst is over now and we can breathe again
I want to hold you high, and steal my pain away
There's so much left to learn, and no one left to fight
I want to hold you high and steal your pain
'Cause I'm broken when I'm open
And I don't feel like I am strong enough
'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away
'Cause I'm broken when I'm open
And I don't feel like I am strong enough
'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away
'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away
You've gone away,
You don't feel me here anymore<start>[Music: Pauly/LaBrie]

Learn to teach
And teach to learn
Open your eyes
Knowledge returns
Pass on the word
The modern virus
Spread it through the crowd
Watch it grow
Your mother taught you
How to sing a song
Your father showed you
How to tie a knot
Will you teach your kids
In the same way
Coming generations
Will they play this game
What makes us different
Like no other
Is that we can listen
Learn from our father
Mistakes that were made
We don't have to repeat
We've been given a choice
If we care to believe
Every single teacher
Has been taught herself
She takes this information
And feeds the new machine
Once there were wise men
Who told a story
Current tales spread on a web
And rumours fuel the pages
What makes us different
Like no other
Is that we can listen
Learn from our father
Mistakes that were made
We don't have to repeat
We've been given a choice
If we care to believe
What makes us different
Like no other
Is that we can listen
Learn from our father
Mistakes that were made
We don't have to repeat
We've been given a choice
If we care to believe<start>I've had a world of possibilities
Slip through my hands
And prayers that went unanswered
That I couldn't understand
There's a faith that can move mountains
But I never let it move me
I only trust in things that I could see
So much frustration in trying it alone
I've had the revelation I can't make it on my own
Deep in my heart
Deep in my soul
There was always something missing
Now you've got my full attention
I give you my life
Surrender control
I finally learned to listen to the call
I give you my all
There are moments in the journey
Where I wonder where you are
And sometimes I forget
That you live inside my heart
It's then I hear you whisper
"I've been here all along"
And I'm in the hands of mercy where I belong
A silent conversation when you speak to me
It's the sweetest inspiration and all I'll ever need
Deep in my heart
Deep in my soul
There was always something missing
Now you've got my full attention
I give you my life
Surrender control
I finally learned to listen to the call
I give you my all
Every single day in my life I live
Every little thing that I have to give
Lord I freely give it
Lord I freely give it
Every single day in my life I live
Every little thing that I have to give
Lord I freely give it
Lord I freely give it
Deep in my heart
Deep in my soul
There was always something missing
Now you've got my full attention
I give you my life
Surrender control
I finally learned to listen to the call
I give you my all
I give you my everything
All my life I surrender<start>Sweet Inspiration
For the whole of my nation
Every day you spend in captivity
Every day you're denied your liberty
You were always searching for a better way
Always searching for a brighter day
Looking for a way
Searching for

Sweet, sweet inspiration
You give me
Sweet inspiration
You give me
Sweet, sweet inspiration

Every time I look into your eyes
You always take me, take me by surprise
You're always looking for a better way
Always searching for a brighter day

,<start>We live in hope of love
And wait to die
And sadness all around us
Waits for crying
And feelings
That once meant so much
Are left to dry and trun to dust
And ashes
We learn to wheel and deal
And say goodbye
And madness all around us
Makes for dyin'
Young deceivers soon turn old
And loft to die amongst their gold
And cash it
Give it up or me live just to die
Give it up (Give it up)
Give it up, give yourself time
(Give it up)
Give it up, save yourself
Give it up
(Give it up)
Give it up
(Give it up)
We drive a million miles to see the sun
Hoping we are not too late for saving
The Lord will smile on you today
And give you love that you can trade
For matches and TV and movie stars
And driving cars as cashes
Give it up or me live just to die
Give it up (Give it up)
Give it up, give yourself time
(Give it up)
Give it up, save yourself
Give it up
(Give it up)
Give it up
(Give it up)
Give it up
Give it up<start>Everything I'm saying is coming out all wrong,
Please bear with me
I've got so much to say
Let me explain myself to you
Forgive me, forgive me not
I'm sorry for what it's worth, I know I'm wrong
Can't you see I'm still me
Are you listening?
Nothing I can say will make this right
Just give it time
Why can't I spit it out?
I need relief
Your sympathy
Forgive me, forgive me not
I'm sorry for what it's worth, I know I'm wrong
Can't you see I'm still me
Are you listening?<start>(Before we begin, thank you
Thank you, oh thank you, thank you
Thank you)
I'm not a bad person, I don't drink and I don't kill
I've got no evil habits and I probably never will
I don't sing like Elvis Presley, I can't dance like Fred Astaire
But there's one thing in my favour, (what) I'm a millionaire (that's beautiful)
And I got more money than a horse has hairs
'Cause my rich old uncle died and answered all my prayers
But having all this money is gonna bring me down
If you ain't with me honey to help me spread it around
I could get myself a nose job, I could diet for a year
But I'll never be Robert Redford, 'cause I'm much too fond of beer
Please don't misunderstand me it's not love I'm trying to buy
It's just I got all this here money and I'm a pretty ugly guy
But I got more money than a horse has hairs
'Cause my rich old uncle died and answered all my prayers
But having all this money is gonna bring me down
If you ain't with me honey to help me spread it around
I don't mind if you love me for my money
If you love me for whatever else I've got
Except for all this stuff I'm alone in Fort Knox
I don't guess I'm doing all that hot
But I got more money than a horse has hairs
'Cause my rich old uncle died and answered all my prayers
But having all this money is gonna bring me down
If you ain't with me honey to help me spread it around
Hey you, come here babe
Stop crying
Put a quarter in the jukebox<start>Fading everything to black and blue
You look a lot like you
Shatter in the blink of an eye
You keep sailing right on through
Every time you say you're learning
You just look a lot like me
Pale under the blistering sky
White and red
Black and blue
You've been waiting a long time
You've been waiting a long time
To fall down on your knees
Cut your hands
Cut yourself until you bleed
Fall asleep next to me
Wait for everyone to go away
And in a dimly lit
room where you've got nothing to hide
Say your goodbyes
Tell yourself we'll read
a note that says
I'm sorry everyone
I'm tired of feeling nothing goodbye
Wash your face
Dry your eyes
Cause you've been waiting a long time
You've been waiting a long long time
To fall down on your knees
Cut your hands
Cut yourself until you bleed
But fall asleep next to me
Have a dream I'm falling down
On my face
Scrape my knees
Scrape my hands until they bleed
Cause you're fast asleep next to me
Next to me, next to me, next to me<start>(wally rathie/tom rathie/ed stevens)

If I was a stranger, lookin' for love, standin' in the rain
And if I needed some help from above
Would consolation be enough
Would you remember, could we forget
If I was a stranger, would you let me in
Find a place inside your heart, wash away my loneliness
If I was a stranger, would you let love begin
Right from the start, to the end
I've been waiting all of my life, for love to arrive
Now that I found you, my soul is alive
This dedication will survive
I still remember, that night we met
If I was a stranger, would you let me in
Find a place inside your heart, wash away my loneliness
If I was a stranger, would you let love begin
Right from the start, till the end
I've been waiting such a long time
For this love to come along
True devotion is so hard to find
Could you give your heart again
Wash away my loneliness
Would you remember, could we forget
If I was a stranger, would you let me in
Find a place inside your heart, wash away my loneliness
If I was a stranger, would you let love begin
Right from the start, to the end
If I was a stranger, would you let me in
Find a place inside your heart, wash away my loneliness
If I was a stranger, would you let love begin
Right from the start, to the end<start>Sid shot dope and then got drunk
He did it his way "punk"
He didn't have a problem
Till he met that bloody cunt
Sid Vicious was innocent
They say he killed her it can't be so
The fucking queen should know
Heroin and anarchy
Ah ah ah
Innocent, innocent, innocent, innocent
It's not his fault that she died
He liked his chick fried
Now his face is on my shirt
We won't forget his famous smirk
Innocent, innocent, innocent, innocent!<start>Giver of every breath I breathe

People Burying their dead
I ask somebody what the time is
But time doesn't matter to them yet
People talking without speaking
Trying to take what they can get
I ask you if you remember
Propekt, how could I forget?
Drums
Here it comes
Don't you wish that life could be as simple,
As fish swimming round in a barrel.
When you've got the gun?
Oh and I'll run
Here it comes
We're just two little figures in a soup bowl
Trying to get the anaconda control
When I wasn't one<start>And wil the vows be heard
Of immortal desire
A breathtaking darkness
Into the abyss we dive
As you were mine
And as memories fade
Just like trails of smoke
On a midwinter's night
You kept holding me tight
As you were mine
On came the nights
When stormclouds veiled the skies
All heavens stood still
And all the worlds did collide
"Forgive me - I failed!"
Lovelorn I will die
Nothing more than a dream
That you were mine
In my cold whilte hands
A lover's bequest
There were stars on our side
Oh Eva - just one last caress
For your were mine<start>I see you from across the room
My eyes tied and ever so consumed
Oh girl, you know you've got me
I wish you all the best of luck
To catch a careless thief that broke your heart
Oh girl, you know you've got me
I feel you but your just so far away
Let's fight fire with fire so my confession's made
[Chorus]
Oh and I'm just a thief that stole your heart from out on a limb
You be the sheriff and point out everything that I did
And I regret to say it but I killed love again
So baby just do your job and put me away for it
I'm locked up and weighted down with chains
Like a bandit, you don't know my name
Oh girl you know you've got me
You say you need some clarity to figure out what you're gonna do with me
Oh girl you know you've got me
I feel you but you're just so far away
Let's fight fire with fire so we can burn the page away
[Chorus]
Oh and I'm just a thief that stole your heart from out on a limb
You be the sheriff and point out everything that I did
And I regret to say it but I killed love again
So baby just do your job and put me away for it
I was the thief and I know you have to send,
To send a note that will put me to my end
Oh girl have mercy on my soul
[Chorus]
Oh and I'm just a thief that stole your heart from out on a limb
You be the sheriff and point out everything that I did [2x]
And I regret to say it but I killed love again
So baby just do your job and put me away for it<start>Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
An' cov'ring the crossroads I'm standin' at,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Mama, you're just on my mind.
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
I am not pleading or sayin', "I can't forget."
I do not walk the floor bowed down an' bent, but yet,
Mama, you're just on my mind
I am not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no,"
Please understand me, I'm not calling for you to go.
I'm just breathin' to myself, pretendin' not that I don't know,
Mama, you're just on my mind.
When you wake up in the mornin', baby, look inside your mirror.
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be there.
But I'd be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on his mind
Someone who has had you on his mind
Maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Mama you're just on my mind<start>Capo at 2 (intro D Em G Em D

So turn off this sound I'm ready to go down
I don't know myself, I don't you either
You're full of disease it's something I discovered
I know you've been mixing with Big Brother's brother
It ain't the knife in the heart that tears you apart
It's just the thought of someone
It's just the thought of someone
Em Em
It's just the thought of someone sticking it in, sticking it in
So if you think that's funny I'm not really laughng honey
Your love letters are confetti I ripped them up my hands were sweaty
And then those ghastly faces recur in nightmare places
Happy hours come and go much too short and much too long

There's a Brave New World awaiting all you kids out there
With a brand new way of getting through your day there
Don't you ever be mistaken about whose looking out for you
Ego is easily shaken when you find that it's only you
And this Brave New World
It's a Brave New World
It's a Brave New World
There's a disappointment awaiting all you fools out there
If you entertain the notion that society cares
In a world of nuclear fear presumably seeking peace
Our lives are drawn together by the sheer necessity
Of this Brave New World
It's a Brave New World
It's a Brave New World

Because the Light is slowly spreading the truth begins to dawn

It's a Brave New World
It's a Brave New World<start>Between me and you
I've been thinking about the future and
Between me and you
I think I'm losing it now
Between me and you
I've been worried about the future and
Between me and you
I think I'm losing it now
And all my life, I've been told
Follow your dreams but the trail went cold
And the heart don't lie
And that's a good luck charm
But I'm watching it tear out of my arms
And there's a power in letting go
I guess I didn't want to let you know
These hours I'm working ain't nearly enough
And sometimes its like a bullet came and blasted me right of out of the blue
But I'm doing my best to not let it get between me and you
Between me and you
(Come on child)
I've been struggling to carry the weight
(Get up child)
Between me and you
(Come on child)
I think I'm losing it now
(You got to fly)
The first time that I saw your face
Time stood still
I found my place
Now I'm watching it tear right out of my arms
And there's a power in letting go
I guess I didn't want to let you know
These hours I'm working ain't nearly enough
And chasing every dollar girl is this what I was born to do?
But I'm doing my best not to let it get between me and you
I remember you in white in the garden
Its been trial after trial
Through the ringer in the back
At the window of this track
I was just too proud to know
(Come on child)
'Cause there's a power in letting go
Never thought it'd be so hard
These hours I'm working ain't nearly enough
And sometimes its like a bullet came and blasted me right of out of the blue
And I feel like I've got nothing to show
And I've been wondering what I'm suppose to do
And I'm doing my best not to let it get
And I'm doing my best not to let it get
Between me and you<start>I'll give you careless amounts of out right
Acceptance if you want it. I'll give you
Encouragement to choose the path that you want if you need it.
You can speak of anger and doubts,
Your fears and freak-outs and I'll hold it.
You can share your so-called
Shame filled accounts of times in your life and I won't judge it.
And there are no strings attached,
You owe me nothing for giving the love that I give.
You owe me nothing for caring the way that I have.
I give you thanks for receiving, it's my privilege,
And you owe me nothing in return.
You can ask for space for yourself
And only yourself and I'll grant it.
You can ask for freedom as well
Or time to travel and you'll have it.
You can ask to live by yourself
Or love someone else and I'll support it.
You can ask for anything you want
Anything at all and I'll understand it.
I bet you're wondering when
The next payback shoe will eventually drop.
I bet you're wondering when my conditional police will force you to cough up.
I bet you're wondering how far you have now danced your way back into dead.
This is the only kind of love
As I understand it that there really is.
You can express your deepest of truths
Even if it means I'll lose you and I'll hear it.
You can fall into the abyss
On the way to your bliss
And I'll empathize with.
You can say that you'll have to skip town
To chase your passion and I'll hear it.
You can even hit rock bottom, have a mid-life crisis and I'll hold it.<start>If I just think about it, I'm always wasting time
Applying cream to this.
It never stops the itching, the burning cracking skin
And I have had enough of it
We are the most challenged of friends
Taking what we need to live
But I will fall with one more pull or pluck of this
Pray for the time, I've got my mind, set, pay for the seats
I've got to see the way we pull through
We are the most shallow of friends
Taking what we want to live
But I will fall with one more pull or pluck of this<start>The mountains are waiting
The full moon has come
I got lost on highways
But don't ask me where I've been
Or what I've done
Oh Lord send me transmission
Forgive me for what I've become
The Sun is gonna save me
Put a little love into my lonely soul
The Sun is gonna save me
Put a little love into my lonely soul
Oh don't you know I need her loving you
It's no desire<start>You and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive
Please just let us go insane
We're travelling where spiders lay eggs
With our heads above the waste
The water broke our fall
You and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive
You and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive
I can't carry on for long
I'll start to feel the pain again
Now the days are all the same
Losing sight and hold of home
You and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive
Cause there will come
A day when you silence
The crowds
And you and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive
It feels as black as the thoughts I had
When the road was as dark as my fears
And just take comfort in knowing that
All of this ends when I am done
Please just let us go insane
There's nothing to declare but ours
You and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive
Cause there will come
A day when you silence
The crowds
Because you and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive<start>Questa storia, ha un'unica morale

When I'm with you
I will thank-you for all you've done for me
I love you so
We will last forever, I know
Forever and one day
I will always give my love to you
Till the day I die
Chorus:
Always and forever
I will love you
Always and forever
My love is true
I love you just the way you are
Always, forever
Always and forever
I will love you
Always and forever
My love is true
I promise you that we'll never part
Always, forever
I don't wanna lose what we've begun
Two lovers at one love
Faith and honesty in our hearts
That's what we share
We will last forever, I know
Forever and one day
I will always give my love to you
Till the day I die
Chorus
We will last forever, I know
Forever and one day
I will always give my love to you

baby baby baby love love love love you<start>When the roof falls in, the sky begins to pour
All the ground erodes away with rushing water
The tide comes in and swallows up the shore
All the land disappears, we walk no longer, we walk no longer
[Chorus:]
We float upon a broken ocean
Where nothing ripples in its wake
We float but nothing stays in motion
'Til the broken ocean breaks
When the lesson's learned and written on a page
I'll buy the book to watch it burn and save the ashes
For soon arrives an age, a loss of innocence when we get judged in every way
That stop the splashes, stop the splashes
[Chorus:]
We float upon a broken ocean
Where nothing ripples in its wake
We float but nothing stays in motion
'Til the broken ocean breaks<start>There's a soul man
And he's shuffling in my head
He lives ah he lived ah he live ah he's living
And I'm never going to grow old wishing
Could have my time again
He shuffle with the gypsy lady in my dreams
And she screams with her hips when he kiss her oh so
Something when he moves doesn't have to move much
But he does it with such gentle tenderness. I'm singing
Young men stomping in the bullpen
Looking for some good zen
Often to do the dumb things
Looking for some a-ah-ah-amen
There's a soul man listening to the soul tamb
Playing in his right hand now he found his own sound
And it's okay
He never speak for-the-sake-of-speaking
Doesn't talk all-that-talking no he doesn't say nothing
Til he got something to say
He shuffle with the gypsy lady in my dreams
And she screams with her hips when he kiss her oh so
Something got me singing oh I never never
Never gonna
Grow old wishing
Could have my time again<start>The picture is far too big to look at kid
Your eyes won't open wide enough
And you are constantly surrounded
By the swirling stream of what is and what was
Well, we all made our predictions
But the truth still isn't out
But if you wanna see the future
Go stare into a cloud
And keep trying to find your way out
Of that maze of memories
It all sort of looks familiar
Until you get up close and then it's different clearly
But each time you turn a corner
You are, you are right back where you were
And your only hope is that forgetting
Might make a door appear
Well, is it your fear of being buried
That makes you so afraid to speak?
An avalanche of opinions
Like the one that fell, that I am now underneath
It was my voice that moved the first rock
And I would do it all over again
So, I mean it's cool if you keep quiet
But I like singing, yeah
So I'll be holding my note and stomping
And strumming and feeling so very lucky
There is nothing I know except this lifetime
Is one moment and wishing will just leave me empty
So you can try and live in darkness
But you will never shake the light
It will greet you every morning
And it'll make you more aware with its absence at night
When you are wrapped up in your blankets, baby
That comfortable cocoon
But I have seen the day of your awakening, boy
And it's coming soon
So go ahead and lose yourself in liquor
And you can praise the clouded mind
But it isn't what you are thinking, no
It's the course of history, your position in line
You are just a piece of the puzzle
So I think you better find your place
And don't go blamin' your knowledge
On some fruit you ate
'Cause there's been a great deal of discussion
Yes, about the properties of man
Animal or angel? You were carved from bone
But your heart it's just sand
And the wind is going to scatter it
And cover everything with love
So if it makes you happy then
Keep kneeling, Mama, but I am standing up
Because this veil, it has been lifted, yes
My eyes are wet with clarity
I have been a witness to such wonders
Oh, I have searched for them all across this country
But I think I'll be returning now
To the town where I was born
And I understand you must keep movin' friend
But I am headed home
Yeah, I'm gonna follow the road
And let the scenery sweeping by easily enter my body
And I'll send you all this message in code
Underground, over mountains, through forests and deserts and cities
Ah, ah, ah, all across electric wires, and baited line, ya
The hook's in deep boys, there is no more time
So you can struggle in the water, be too stubborn to die
Or you could just let go and be lifted to the sky, ah, ah, ah<start>Gomena ato sukoshi

My love
Summer's kiss is over, baby
Over
Do you know the words?
Sing along with me
And put on your rose fur coat, baby
It's 1973
My love, this dream I have each night
I stare into a blinding light
Alone, I stare
Demons, be gone
Away from me
And come on down to the corner
I got something i want you to see
The burning sun
Too hot for shade
Come lay down in the cool grass
With me, baby let's watch that
Summer fade
My love, this dream I have each night
I stare into a blinding light
Alone, I stare
So sweet
This dream is not a dream
I wake with it
Inside of me
Alone, I swear<start>Well, I knew you'd return to the other side
Well, the day began, I woke again and died
If you don't come around
I'll know what it's worth
How deep is the ground?
As flat as the earth
How deep is the ground?
As flat as the earth<start>Folks, I'd like to sing a song about the American Dream
About me, about you, the way our American hearts beat
Down in the bottom of our chests, about the special feeling
We get in the cockles of our hearts, maybe below the cockles
Maybe in the sub-cockle area, maybe in the liver
Maybe in the kidneys, maybe even in the colon, we don't know
I'm just a regular Joe with a regular job
I'm your average white suburbanite slob
I like football and porno and books about war
I've got an average house with a nice hardwood floor
My wife and my job, my kids and my car
My feet on my table and a Cuban cigar
But sometimes that just ain't enough
To keep a man like me interested
(Oh no)
No way
(Uh-uh)
No, I've gotta go out and have fun
At someone else's expense
(Oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I drive really slow in the ultrafast lane
While people behind me are going insane
I'm an asshole
(He's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole
(He's an asshole, such an asshole)
I use public toilets and piss on the seat
I walk around in the summertime saying
"How about this heat?"
I'm an asshole
(He's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole
(He's the world's biggest asshole)
Sometimes I park in handicapped spaces
While handicapped people make handicapped faces
I'm an asshole
(He's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole
(He's a real fucking asshole)
Maybe I shouldn't be singing this song
Ranting and raving and carrying on
Maybe they're right when they tell me I'm wrong
Nah!
I'm an asshole
(He's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole
(He's the world's biggest asshole)
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna get myself a 1967 Cadillac, El Dorado convertible
Hot pink with whaleskin hub caps and all leather cow interior
And big brown baby seal eyes for headlights, yeah
And I'm gonna drive around in that baby at 115 mph
Getting one mile per gallon, sucking down quarter pounder
Cheese burgers from McDonald's in the old fashioned
Non-biodegradable Styrofoam containers
And when I'm done sucking down those grease ball burgers
I'm gonna wipe my mouth with the American flag
And then I'm gonna toss the Styrofoam container right out the side
And there ain't a goddamned thing anybody can do about it
You know why? Because we got the bombs, that's why
Two words, nuclear fucking weapons, okay?
Russia, Germany, Romania
They can have all the democracy they want
They can have a big democracy cake walk
Right through the middle of Tienanmen square
And it won't make a lick of difference
Because we've got the bombs, okay? John Wayne's not dead
He's frozen and as soon as we find the cure for cancer
We're gonna thaw out the duke and he's gonna be pretty pissed off
You know why? Have you ever taken a cold shower?
Well multiple that by 15 million times
That's how pissed off the Duke's gonna be
I'm gonna get the Duke and John Cassavetes
(Hey)
And Lee Marvin
(Hey)
And Sam Peckinpah
(Hey)
And a case of whiskey and drive down to Texas
(Hey, you know you really are an asshole)
Why don't you just shut-up and sing the song pal
I'm an asshole
(He's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole

Who lost his love when he turned bad
Take a message to Mary but don't tell Ã¢??er where I am
Take a message to Mary but don't say I'm in a jam
You can tell her I had to see the world or tell Ã¢??er that my ship set sail
You can say she better not wait for me but don't tell her I'm in jail
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail
Take a message to Mary but don't tell Ã¢??er what I've done
Please don't mention the stagecoach and the shot from a careless gun
You can tell her I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding day
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Until my dying day
Take a message to Mary but don't tell Ã¢??er all you know
My heart's achin' for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so
Just tell her I went to Timbuktu, tell her I'm searchin' for gold
You can say she better find someone new to cherish and to hold
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold<start>Verse 1:
A third party at a table for two
Im sorry I dont mean to intrude
But it was me and you before you met her
And all the love songs you wrote for me
(You) stuck her name where mine used to be
But my name in them fit the rhythm better
Prechorus:
Id go if you had a ride
And Id smoke if you had a light
And I fall every time for this
Chorus:
And love is trippy like that
Sometimes you think that youve got it
Nobodys gonna trip you
Outta this one baby
But love will slip through your hands
You never know how to hold it
Control it youre gripping
Its tripping you up
Verse 2:
Says the woman who sings at the bar
This is for you, you know who you are
I was you once, looking for someone
I never found
She paints in a low smoky voice
Pictures of bruises, bad days and boys
And how they stood her up just to let her down
Prechorus:
Shed win if you were the prize
(She) gives in to all of your lies
She falls every time for this(Chorus)
Verse 3:
For all of the girls who feel like theyre overdressed
Undersexed, starving for yesses or maybes
Tired of always being ignored
He might see the available chair
Beside me, the invitation is there
But Im not the kind of scratch hes itching for
Prechorus:
Id go if you had a ride
Id smoke if you had a light
I fall every time for this<start>Today I realized I was gay
I've been gay for a while now
I like to fuck guys in the ass
Fuck you, that's my life
I'm gay, fuck you, I'm gay
Do you wanna be gay?
It's fun to be a flamer
I'm gay, fuck you, I'm gay<start>Well, I know where you've been
And I've seen what you've seen
And I've read all the books
On your shelves and in your nooks
Still I don't understand
Though it's there in your hands
Why you beg and you steal
For a love that isn't real
Happiness can find you nowhere
Happiness can find you nowhere
Happiness can find you nowhere
Oh baby, don't make me sad
You're the only one I ever had
Oh baby, don't make me sad
You're the only love I ever had, ever had
Don't make me sad
In a field by a stone
I could sit for days alone
Not a thought for myself
Not my happiness or health
Just a fool that I love
With a push and a shove
It ain't easy to be true
But I do it just for you
Happiness will find us somewhere
Happiness will find us somewhere
Happiness will find us somewhere
Oh baby, don't make me sad
You're the only one I ever had
Oh baby, don't make me sad
You're the only love I ever had, ever had
Don't make me sad
Do I love? Yes, I love
Think I love, I love you, baby
All my days I've never known it
All my life I've never known it
I'm not scared to be alone
And my house feels like a home
I don't care if no one phones
And I don't care a thing
About getting gray and old
And I don't care
Oh baby, don't make me sad
You're the only one I ever had
Oh baby, don't make me sad
You're the only love I ever had, ever had
Don't make me sad
Do I love? I think I love
Oh yes, I love, I love you, baby
Do I love? I think I love
Oh yes, I love, I love my baby<start>I wish I could push a button and make the pain all go away
I wish I had the magic words but I don't know what to say
I wish I could take the wasted years and throw them all away
And it might sound easy for me to say
You are going to find a way to fix what's broken
Fix what's broken
You say you like people with fire, but you don't like it when you get burned
Broke about a thousand hearts, now you don't like it when it's your turn
You wonder when you're going to figure out all the lessons that you need to learn
And it might sound simple for me to say you will learn someday that
All you need is love
All those big dreams that were so important, they don't mean anything now
All you need is love
All those hard times when people hurt you, they don't mean anything now
All you need is love
Love is all you need to fix what's broken
Love is all you need to fix what's broken
You turn sunshine into chaos everywhere you go
Now your girl has got a brand new life with a guy you used to know
She got tired of the drama you make when life gets too slow
And it might sound simple for me to say you will heal someday now
All you need is love
All those big dreams that were so important, they don't mean anything now
All you need is love
All those hard times when people turned on you, they don't mean anything now
All you need is love
All those happy endings that never happened, they don't mean anything now
All you need is love
Love is all you need to fix what's broken
Love is all you need to fix what's broken
Love is all you need
Now, enough is enough
Enough is enough
The time is going to come when you stop feeling sorry for yourself
Yeah, you were broken when you were young and you never got over it
You were damaged when you were young, and now you take it out on everyone
The time is going to come when you say that enough is enough
The time is going to come when you stop beating yourself up
Stop beating yourself up
Stop beating yourself up
The time is going to come when you see that all you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love, love, love, love, love
The time is going to come when you see
All you need is love
All you need is love
Love is all you need to fix what's broken

You hold in your hands

Can never be sold
For all we know, these days are all numbered,
But things could get better I know,
Cause I'll be the first and the last one to go,

Only did it because she could
Chewed you up and spat you out
Bad girl was never no good

Thinks I'm gonna repeat herstory

Makin' you follow me, makin' me a suspect
You seem to think I'm playing her game
Don't you know my name
That was her this is me
We're different as can be
She and I are nothin' alike
You're confusing day and night
That was then, this is now
You wanna trust me but you don't now how
I'm never gonna mess around let you down can't you see
That was her and baby, this is me
Stop makin' me feel so bad
Cause I'm the best thing that you ever had
The only thing I'm guilty of is giving you too much love
It's makin' you crazy, makin' you a wreck
Makin' you follow me, makin' me a suspect
You seem to think I'm playing her game
Don't you know my name
Don't suffocate me
Give me some space
Don't make me pay for all her mistakes
Believe in the love that's in my kiss
Don't see things that don't exist
It's makin' you crazy, makin' you a wreck
Makin' you follow me, makin' me a suspect
You seem to think I'm playing her game
Don't you know my name<start>Such is the way of the world
You can never know
Just where to put all your faith
And how will it grow
Gonna rise up
Burning black holes in dark memories
Gonna rise up
Turning mistakes into gold
Such is the passage of time
Too fast to fold
Suddenly swallowed by signs
Low and behold
Gonna rise up
Find my direction magnetically
Gonna rise up
Throw down my ace in the hole<start>Would you like a way home
I bleed my own
Round the hangin tree
Swaying in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one
Swaying
Can you see under my thumb
There you are
Round the hangin tree
Swaying in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one
Swaying<start>By Graham Nash
When you were asleep
I was kissing your forehead
You gave a frown
So I kissed you again
You started waking
And put your arms round my waist
Just making sure I was there
Then you drifted away
Then you drifted away
And when I awoke
I found out I'd been dreaming
Some of my bed clothes were still on the floor
I looked around
Realized you were leaving me
I saw the back of your dress
As you slipped through the door
As you slipped through the door
And when I return
I will kiss your eyes open
Take off my clothes
And I'll lie by your side
Then I will wait
Till The sandman is done with you
And as you sleepily rise
You'll find I'll be there
You'll find I'll be there
There, there

With an awful achin' head.
Woke up this mornin'
With an awful achin' head.
My new man left me.
I'm just a bloom in an empty bed.
Now, when my bed gets empty
I get to feelin' kind of mean and blue.
When my bed gets empty,
Get to feelin' awful mean and blue.
The springs are gettin' rusty
Sleepin' single like I do.
I bought me a coffee grinder,
The best one I could find.
You know that I bought me a brand new coffee grinder,
The best one I could find,
So he could grind my coffee.
Babe, I got a brand new grind.
You gotta try, girl, you gotta try.
He was a deep sea diver
With a stroke that could not go wrong.
Deep, deep sea, deep sea diver
With a stroke that just could not go wrong.
He could touch the bottom,
And his wind held out so long.
Oh, he boiled my cabbage,
And he made it awful hot, mmmm.
He boiled it, I got to tell you
That he made it, made it awful hot.
But when he slipped the bacon in,
He overflowed the pot!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
What a sweet man he was.
I went and told my girlfriend Lou.
Remember that old rag of a girl named Lou?
Real sweet man.
I went and told my girlfriend Lou.
That way that girl is, baby,
She must have had a piece of it, too.
And now when you get good lovin',
Don't you, don't you spread the news.
Don't you spread the news.
When you get it and it's good, good, good,
You really ought not to,
You ought not to spread the news.
Because those gals will doublecross you and leave you,
Those gals will doublecross you, and they do,
Those gals will doublecross you
And leave you, leave you, leave you,
Leave you with the empty bed blues!

The best of times the worst of times
We've had some good times in between
Walking down on the boulavard of broken dreams
Up and down the long and winding road
I know we've had our share of pain
Out from under our dark cloud
Left you standing in the rain
Never had too much to say
Just turned your back and walked away
That's the game you played
Oh - Are you shaking in your shoes
Lookin' dazed and confused
Now are you cryin' baby blues
Yeah - Some things you just can't hide
Don't keep them bottled up inside
Now what's behind those baby blues
Baby blues
Baby blues
Baby blues
What's behind those baby blues right now
How far did you go deep down inside
Follow you heart don't live a lie
Life will pass you by in the blink of an eye
Dressed to kill was your look sureal
You had me going in Japan
Lookin' out for number one
You had me eating out your hand
Little boy blue whatcha gonna do
Now ever since you said goodbye
Is it champagne and caviar
You eating humble pie
Was it worth the price to pay
Are you looking back at yesterday
Whatcha got to say
Oh - Are you shaking in your shoes
Looking dazed and confused
Now are you crying baby blues
Yeah - Some things you just can't hide
Don't keep them bottled up inside
Now what's behind those baby blues
Baby blues

when theres nothin wrong and you dont wanna talk about this
something on your mind
you try and point the finger, but you wont let this linger
cant take this anymore
shock my systems with charisma
leaves you breaking in my waste
lost my faith, ive lost my faith,
ive lost my crucial time and place
its hard to say youre sorry when theres nothing wrong
and you dont wanna talk about this
you will understand that you will never need me,
so why dont you just leave me
and let me be the one to take the fall
shock my system with chrisma
leaves you breaking in my waste
lost my faith, ive lost my faith,
ive lost my crucial time and place<start>A friend of mine woke me up
To tell me about his dream
All the lights in the world went black
He felt like a tiger in a burning tree
It was like he was late for something that he did not want to see
His life looked better on paper, he lives like a tiger in a burning tree
Blow out the candles and make a wish
I thought about a woman from a city in the South
She lost her car when the bottom fell out
She sold her life to the deep blue sea
She left a message for the world to see
She knows better what its like to be a tiger in a burning tree
Close your eyes and take a big deep breath
Blow out the candles and make a wish
When I was a child I painted my toys
Angel blue and devil red
I broke them into pieces, set them on fire, and shoved them under my bed
I never learned how to play nice with all the other kids
I never learned how to draw inside the line and probably never will
Close your eyes and take a big deep breath
Imagine a world so much better than this
Now close your eyes and jump to a place you would think to be
Then you could tell me what it feels like to be
A tiger in a burning tree<start>Grab your arms and choose a side
There's a battle to be won
A psychic war's upon us, and the walls are closing in
And it's time to change the time
Brave are those who do decide
? (the next part I cannot figure out at all)?
Unless the calls get misdirected
Another trend to follow
Another word to linger on
They may not even know the reasons why
You think without a vision, and they try to call it ours
And it's causin' me to culture shock
The fools all hide behind the fashion
The new age rebels have no cause
But little do they realize, that a true change can come from within
But that's too simple to be true
My hair looks better now in blue
Is it true profession, or just another way to stay along?
Sometimes I even ask myself
Another generation, another forward state of mind
It's somewhere deep within our consciousness
Is it a new beginning, for those who need a second chance
Maybe then we'll find out why we did
Another generation, another forward state of mind
It's somewhere deep within our consciousness
Problems of the ???, problems of the kids
Problems are the mistakes of the past we've made
It's time to look forward to a third generation
Another generation, another forward state of mind
It's somewhere deep within our consciousness<start>Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
Until the break of day, let me see you make him smile
His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one you love?
When he's standing right in front of you
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed<start>Now she's gone without a sign
Without a warning.
The voice of anybody else
Is on the answering machine.
The story's ending,
You have to do it by yourself, tonight.
So many years have passed,
You shared so many hours
Expensive ones, you've never cared
And now she's gone without goodbye,
She's left no number
Like anyone from anywhere, oh boy.
Are you lonely?
Did she hurt you
In this northern town?
Ain't nobody
To console you?
She has get you down.
All your longings she returned,
She's lit the candle of love and passion in your heart,
But now you're forced again to dial another number.
You should have known it from the start, oh boy.
Are you lonely?
Ain't nobody in this northern town?
Are you lonely now?<start>Barren stares as they light up the screen
Bearing teardrops that shatter in slow motion
Novocaine our brains and we're out like lights
And as I'm growing older I'm bored
And I remember when misery thrilled me much more
When I can't relax and I'd like to go back
But that's gone, yeah that's gone
Turn around, turn the volume down
We're counting the days down
'Til the day when we'll live in a video
I'll be stone faced and pale you'll pout in stereo
Twenty four hours every day of the year
Now what fun, I can't wait 'til the future gets here
Closing in on the pain and the torture
He's slamming the door like it's something to strive for
The girl tearing curtains down, looks funny as hell
And of sense of humor can there be any doubt
Yeah well natural selection has weeded it out?
Just to keep me from laughing out loud
But that's gone, we don't think that way no more
That's gone, turn around, turn the volume down
We're counting the days down
'Til the day when we'll live in a video
I'll be stone faced and pale, you'll pout in stereo
Twenty four hours every day of the year
Now what fun, I can't wait 'til the future gets here
Well I've seen some old friends sort of die
Or just turn into whatever must have been inside them
And whatever all of us had then in common grew up and left home
We don't think that way no more
Turn around, turn the volume down
We're counting the days down
'Til the day when we'll live in a video
I'll be stone faced and pale, you'll pout in stereo
Twenty four hours every day of the year
Now what fun, I can't wait 'til the future gets here<start>there are no lyrics. Mensforth Hill is simply "something about england"

Watching the bobbins,
go up and down.
Fine Irish linen
for a ladies gown.
One shirt a penny,
seven in a tag;
ten hours a day
and her heart begins to drag.
This never ending cycle goes on.
But she promised she would never stay...
for long.
Rocking the treadle,
ache in her soul.
She keeps the rhythm
and it takes a toll.
Threading the needle,
strains in her eyes.
Old withered fingers
steal her young girl's pride
She's saving every penny she earns,
because the passion for her freedom
still burns.<start>It was a wild idea to start
We were lost in an hour, every thinking part
In the middle of nowhere
Oh man hey look where we are
I know your teeth are shut and proud
But there are rhythms in the city make your head feel loud
Uh-huh so get it out, get it out
You are a long ways up river from home
Right here this water is mean but its the same as your own
You better swim for your life
It's both at the same time
It was a wild idea to start
A drip on the head got it wet in the heart
And it looked just like a river but was a freeway in the dark
Oh in the dark
Oh you're always so damn ready oh
Oh were you always so damn ready oh
I never want to call it off
I never want to call it off oh
Never been that ready
I never want to call it off

One leg stretched for the curb
The other one grounds itself against rebirth
So the swallows will stay in the barn
The finches left a long time ago
The fall must be oh so close
I cannot exist in this circumference
I keep a crippled leg on home base
Where I hang my crutches
I'm so weak and needy
My knees are so weak
Crutches keep me from kneeling
I need something I can fall back on
Something to relate to
Something to rotate to, now
Nothing's so far away
And nothing so good can ever stay
Now, could it?
And I know that the stars all have names
Some of them just aren't as good as others
Some of them are just letters and numbers
Sometimes I forget
That the smallest things can be oh so big
Where'd you hang my crutches?
I'm so weak I'm bleeding
I bleed every week
Crutches keep me from kneeling
And there's nothing here to fall back on
Nothing to relate to
Nothing to replace you
Now, nothing seems so far down
Down, I'll shove my foot
Deeper into the ground<start>When your mind is set
And you're just out to get
Things that which I don't know
I guess you're gonna go
And find those things I don't do
Yeah you know it's true
Feels like all I know is not gold
So take it easy
And get your good shoes on
Make like you've nothing to lose
It'll help you choose
'Cos I love you baby
Well it seems like lately
I don't think you feel the way I do
Well our affair is done
It's just come and gone
We're just the same as those fools
Who try and make up the rules
We're born out of evil and gain
The song will remain the same
It's gonna take all the words and just not change
So take it easy
And get your glad rags on
Let's make like we've nothing to lose
It'll help us to choose
'Cos I love you baby
Well it seems like lately
I don't think you feel the way I do<start>That night they were burning for truth
Down on the corner of 14th and U
They took your soul and they took you for fools
Took all the windows from prisons and schools
Now what's a poor man left to do?
One heart now broken in two
You start untying the hands of the youth
New kids hear the sound of the drumming
Mother Nature your Summer is coming
Yesterday and today
Revolution on its way
Amen
It was The Feast and the Famine
Amen
It was The Feast and the Famine
Feast and the Famine
Crossroads with nothing to lose
Out of the basement and in to the news
Come change, now shit getting heavy
Salvation at the ready
You look when I walked by
Still screaming 'til I die
You can't find peace if you can't find a home
You can't survive as an island alone
Black heart with a gaping wound
Put back together by a troubled groove
Check yourself
Wreck your brains
Where is that P.M.A.?

It was The Feast and the Famine
Amen
It was The Feast and the Famine
Feast and the Famine

Hide me
Come find me
Don't wait for help forever flies by me
Here, are you scared, are you lost
in a wasted haven
I could not but I lost myself
Out (out), out (out)
Here, on your skin, in your touch

I could lie, but I lost myself

Let it burn our love disaster
Better on my own
We're better off alone
Holding on the flames get faster

When I asked you to dance
You said there's no band, there's no radio
I got up real slow, started singing real low
When I was melting in your arms I had to let go
So let's re-enact that scene
From what's his name's one act play
I'll be your hero and you'll be the one
If there was no tomorrow
There were no yesterdays
The stolen moments we've borrowed
We wouldn't let slip away
So let's re-enact that scene
From what's his name's one act play
I'll be your hero
So let's re-enact that scene until our dying day
I'll be the hero and you can the one
Yeah, you could be the one that got away<start>Forty-seven dead beats living in the back street
North east west south all in the same house
Sitting in a back room waiting for the big boom
I'm in a bedroom waiting for my baby
She's so mean but I don't care
I love her eyes and her wild wild hair
Dance to the beat that we love best
Heading for the nineties
Living in the wild wild west
The wild wild west
Wild west
Well, Mandy's in the backroom handing out Valium
Sheriff's on the airwaves talking to the D.J.'s
Forty-seven heartbeats beating like a drum
Got to live it up live it up
Ronnie's got a new gun
She's so mean but I don't care
I love her eyes and her wild wild hair
Dance to the beat that we love best
Heading for the nineties
Living in the wild wild west
The wild wild west
Wild west
Now put your flags in the air and march them up and down
You can live it up live it up all over the town
And turn to the left, turn to the right
I don't care as long as she comes tonight
She's so mean but I don't care
I love her eyes and her wild wild hair
Dance to the beat that we love best
Heading for the nineties
Living in the wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
Auw, wild west
Living in the wild wild west
The wild wild west
Wild west
Heading for the nineties living in the eighties
Screaming in a back room waiting for the big boom
Give me give me wild west
Give me give me safe sex
Give me love give me love
Give me time to live it up
She's so mean but I don't care
I love her eyes and her wild wild hair
Dance to the beat that we love best
Heading for the nineties
Living in the wild wild west

You've hurt me for the last time
I'm going away tonight
Fly away, tonight

"I don't want to play
All your games
You're throwing fuel on the fire
Now my desire is burned away"
'Cause waking up in your arms

Though I could pride myself in battles won
For I've been blessed beyond measure
And by His strength alone I'll overcome
Oh, I could stop and count successes like diamonds in my hands
But those trophies could not equal to the grace by which I stand

In Christ alone
I place my trust
And find my glory in the power of the cross
In every victory
Let it be said of me
My source of strength
My source of hope
Is Christ alone
In Christ alone do I glory
For only by His grace I am redeemed
For only His tender mercy
Could reach beyond my weakness to my need
And now I seek no greater honor in just to know Him more
And to count my gains but losses to the glory of my Lord

How's it gonna feel when there's no one to support ya?
How's it gonna feel when you're standing there alone?
You are no exception
There are no reruns
Justify your reasons
Now it is my turn
Your fits of paranoia
Drive your every whim
Well, have you seen her?
This unbearable creature
This is the point, we have the choice to survive the winter
We have achieved so much more than you possibly thought we could
Well, now that you see me
You can achieve anything, just remember, no I in team
There's two in brilliant
We are the wolves of winter
We live in a kingdom of blood
When you gonna rise, seek a man you can dispose of?
When you gonna try to boil my last bone?
This is true obsession
Take me at my worth
Subtle as a steam burn
More than just a scald
You stink of hallelujah
But you wash yourself in sin
Well, have you seen her?

the devil knows I couldn't get far
went to the beach but I couldn't find the path
tried to catch a train but it wasn't where I went
(wanted to) catch a plane but it wasn't (where I flew)
(all the time) I flew (just to get) back to you
I love your way (x2)
wished I had the heart to (presume or) take it out-side
take it outside just to catch a little rain
catch a little rain just to pour a little (ride)
I love your way
I'm a-dreaming of you
and it seems so very simple that
I don't think that I can tell you
and the knocking on my cranium
reminds me of a travel drum
makes it sound a simple feeling
can we go around (a-dreamin') crazy
I love your way
I'm a-dreaming of you<start>Oh, your pretty smile banish any gloom
And when I frown I feel unsound, I drag you down to ground level
I interrupt your flyin' high and summer sky in your mind
But then you grab me by the scruff and we're up, up and over
Over the dirty men, the streets where I retreat from living
Your pretty smile, it could light up any room
I've seen it many times banish any gloom
Darlin', don't you ever stop with that smilin', yeah
Your pretty smile, it could light up any room
I've seen it many times banish any gloom
Darlin', don't you ever stop with that smilin', yeah
One time I've seen the low lands green, I was sixteen and spellbound
I think of you when I glance over these old reels
Greta Garbo, Brigitte Bardot, Marilyn Monroe, such photos
The smog descends around my silhouette of dreams

I've seen it many times banish any gloom

The feeling dies, the reflex stays
We've got a space outside of time
Where no one's no one, and no one's mine
You're going to forget who you were
And learn to become who you are
Fever's fever, hallucinate
Teeth just like powder, tongue detonates
Sleeper's sleeper, you got the sack
It's time that your ghost comes tumbling back
It's one more way to mark your time
The rush of air, the lack of mind
Join the cogs minus love
Abyss with trance falls from above
You're going to forget who you were
And learn to become who you are
Fever's fever accelerates
The wave of submission that marks your fate
Sleeper's sleeper, your paperback
Is crumpled with dreams and what you lack
You're going to forget who you were
And learn to become who you are<start>Rosalita's crawling round the knees
Rest my head, she's calling to me
In my dreams she's there for me
But open my eyes to see you there
I am falling
Sweetness, since you left me
It's been your flag I'm flying
But I'm sick of crying
Why did you choose to deceive me?
Was your plan just to kiss, fuck and leave me?
So, considerately, just please talk to me
I won't portray myself so pitifully
My little conceit, you see
Is that I will never need you more than now
Rosalita's walking out on me
Close the door, she's stalling, I see
She's so sweet, but not for me
But as we sit around and laugh about
She's trying to call me
Darling, though you hurt me
It's not from my lack of trying
You've got a fear of flying high
You have lost your patience
I see myself sink in your estimations
Forget the salutations
Just please study these tears
Your bitter words they just confirm my fears
Gonna let it fuck up all the years
Yet I will not need you more than now<start>Under that smile, behind those eyes I see it all
Your words breed lies, you cry for sympathy
Sometimes the truth unleashes more than you can take
Lost world, lost hope, lost vision, killing you
Don't kill before it grows
Throughout this all, you've learned a lot from me still it grows
That weight you bear is destined to crush your everything
Through time through pain my yearning has never ever wanned

Another child with the stars in her eyes
A wild hearted woman

She could see the light
My efforts went wasted due to falling night
And I know
By the end of the evening
I was in no doubt of all the things
That you could live without
Now, I know
I drag up ancient history
Hope that they'll forgive me
They had nothing but ego's
But they multiply
All the reasons that I would try
That I know
To be making it harder to be seen but, oh
Is it too much to ask for to be left alone?
Yeah, I know
I drag up ancient history
Hope that they'll forgive me
I drag up ancient history
Hope that they'll forgive me
Lay my cards on the table
She could see the light
My efforts went wasted due to falling night
And I know
I drag up ancient history
Hope that they'll forgive me

Always go to church and try to be really nice, really nice.

No! Heaven isn't like that, pal.
No! Heaven isn't like that, now.
No! Heaven isn't like that, child.
Learn to play the harp,
You'll need it while you're there.
Get yourself some wings;
I'm sure you'll get a lovely pair, a fluffy pair.
Reach for a halo, keep it in your hair.
Live a fairy tale eternally with nothing there but puffy air.

Our hero bold, who so it's told,
is a lot like you and me.
His passion burns, the world it turns,
He fills his hand to fill the void,
And fuels the constant feeling,
Of nothingness inside his soul.
Feels like nothing ever did.
Kills like nothing ever could.
Dark and jaded world I hated,
Everything I left behind.
I don't need you, and I don't want you,
World that left me blind.
Beneath the sands of the mighty Sahara lies,
Buried treasure sunken deep,
in darkened tombs where dead men sleep.
Gold fills hands, or is it sand,
The same that covers everything?
Where cities stood, soon deserts found,
Now sink beneath the swelling ground.
Feels like nothing ever did.
Kills like nothing ever could.
Dark and jaded world I hated,
Everything I left behind.
I don't need you, and I don't want you,
World that left me blind.
This world is for the taking,
This world is suffocating.
Plastic bags of novacain,
Some PCP to kill the pain.
Build a tomb to store your rust,
Moth-eaten piles of blowing dust.
Under the sands of the mighty Sahara,
Goes our hero bold, in seach of gold,
a casket for a dying world.
Our hero stands, wealth in hand,
The prize for his endeavors.
The masses cheer, to hide their fears
That no man lives forever.
Feels like nothing ever did.
Kills like nothing ever could.
Dark and jaded world I hated,
Everything I left behind.
I don't need you, and I don't want you,
World that left me blind.

should pay me 5 dollars.
I wrote this song and they said they would pay me,
and I want to buy a hot dog.
What could this be, too much MTV?
Chalk another fad up for its fall into infamy.
What's in a standard if it changes all the time?
You're still having trouble in defining your own kind.
Need I remind you, we all knew you before,
you threw the rocks at the stage from your glass house on the floor?
Now I think you're punk, just because it's in.
You found a foul mouth and a couple safety pins.
Got a peaceful feeling,
I don't want to fight no more.
Got a peaceful feeling,
I don't care if we're punk, or ska, or hardcore,
enough for you, it's sad but true,
you can call us names till your face turns blue.
Our assurance comes from God,
it's nothing new,
we'll never care 'cause we're never cool enough for you.
That smug look on your face,
your nose up in the air,
your patches say you're open-minded,
but still you couldn't bear,
some punk thrown in with ska.
You said it wouldn't work.
Well you can take your Vespa home 'cause ska made you a jerk.
The purist turns a deaf ear.
He's such an intellect,
Does he think his censorship is gaining our respect?
The raising of a fist, like a trigger of a gun.
Stop and see we're all alike, and we can dance as one.
I walked into the room, and she was right there waiting.
Leaning up against the bar,
well she was perpertraitin'.
Slick as snot her spandex,
and blacker than some coal,
she set her gaze upon my bootie,
with disco in her soul.
So much for indecision,
so quick did she decide,
the temptress with her doors open inviting me inside.
"I want to take you home with me",
said the sparkle in her eye.
"I would like to honey, but I'm about to die."
I have got a time bomb,
I strapped it to my chest.
When it blows I'm out of here,
you can have what's left.
The room got kind of quiet,
and you could smell the fear.
I only heard the jukebox play "A Tear is in My Beer".
"So what's the verdict Mister?
When's it gonna blow?"
I just winked at her and said,
"Darlin' I don't know."
Time-bomb tickin' in the room,
everybody goes someday,
blows so quick you better be,
somewhere where it's safe.
Thin skinned thread-bare thinkin',
now you're gonna die,
don't try to rock the jukebox,
just kiss this world good-bye.
What's the deal, don't you feel,
alone now in the silence?
Pushing up the daisies now,
there's better ways for you to diet.
Seeking after sucker wealth,
suckers feel what suckers dealt,
All your life you stuffed your face,
now you're dead I rest my case.
Got a story here to tell,
so you better listen well.
some old lady in a church,
got a nickel in her purse.
You were rich, she was poor.
You dropped some fifties on the floor.
She dropped her nickel with a clank,
she was thinkin' Third World Think Tank.
The Karaoke master,
the drunkard,
and the jerk,
ditch this sorry world and all its worth.
Keep your candle burning,
waiting for the time,
ready to explode,
the bomb is primed.
Up until the middle of the 20th century,
many Americans believed in the idea known as the "Manifest Destiny."
It held that all of North America,
from sea to shining sea,
was rightfully the property of the U.S. and was given to us by God.
Native Americans were unscrupulously thrown off their homelands
and slaughtered in the name of Jesus.
Horror stories of entire tribes being led through rivers while being baptized,
just to be shot and scalped on the other side,
rival those of the Spanish Inquisition.
Today, I see street corner preachers screaming at passers-by,
while the amount of Neo-Nazi Hate crimes are escalating every day.
All of this under a blanket name of "Christianity."
Read Your Bible.
Jesus never beat people or insulted them into believing in him.
He spoke the truth
And set an example by loving every man.
We are called to follow his example.
Remember the Massacres at Sand Creek and meeker.
Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.
Some cowboys were a ridin', ridin' on the range;
The grass was over grazed there,
and spotted like some mange;
The buffalo were dead there,
the trees they all were through,
and if they saw some Injuns,
why they would kill them too.
West or bust, in God we trust,
"Let's rape, let's kill, let's steal"
We can almost justify, anything we feel;
I'm climbing up that ladder,
more brownie points for me I'll work my way to Jesus you wait and see.
Said one cowboy to another,
"I think it would be nice,
if we could take these injuns and convert them all to Christ;
See, they are all disgusting, and bringing me great pain,
and if they don't believe me,
we'll put a bullet in their brains!"
I am always shoutin',
when I go outside,
how people should repent now,
or they're going to die.
My motives are all selfish,
I'm a cannon brimmed with powder.
If people don't believe me,
I just beat them and yell louder.
I see a city on a hill,
I see the only way to be filled,
mighty rushing wind around us,
Holy Spirit burn within us.
[Chorus:]
Burn. Burn. Burn. Within us, within us.
Spirit of truth, my eyes deceive me,
Teach me how to see,
Ears cannot hear, my mouth is too dry to speak.
You have searched me, you, you know me, there is nothing good inside me.
Purge me, make me clean.
My heart needs courage so burn inside of me.
Burn within our hearts oh God.
Teach me to be still.
Let the tears roll from our eyes,
all we want is Jesus Christ.
We want to...
[Chorus]
This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine, I'm gonna hold it up, I'm gonna let it.
[Chorus]
Johnny's got a grip on a blissful life,
He sucks on the smoke from the dope in his pipe.
Wrapped around his fingers, a noose is loosing slack,
strangling his forearm to fill his vewins with smack.
P.C.P. spells gun to the head,
half a syringe or a barrel full of lead.
grasping at straws and coming up empty,
Carving with his life
this somber song of hope:
"Kill me."
Sally spells success M-O-N-E-Y.
If she steps on some toes, it's an eye for an eye.
She's climbing up the ladder, she's building up a wall,
to block out the world or the fear that she'll fall.
Tightrope thins, conviction never stops.
Money means nothing from a 40 floor drop.
her security blanket has worn itself thin,
she's hanging in the closet from a rope of her own sin.
Nothing changes nothing will.
Always skeptic, primed for the kill
Seeking nothing but selfish gain,
filling your pockets, again and again.
Selling your soul, taking you fill.
Grasping at straws, feeding your own will.
Killing your conscience, empty, bereft.
Losing your life for the world, you are left alone.
Some throw bricks through windows and yell,
others beat their backs for fear of hell.
Two-edged sword that cuts flesh to the joints,
the path is narrow, you missed the point.
Fistful of sand a pitiful prize.
YOu're blinding yourself, closing your eyes.
The point was made eons ago,
chaff in the wind, your life's gonna blow.
Nothing you do, nothing can be new.
What is good? What is true?
Seeking to serve not ourselves, never.
The Lord is God, we will live forever.
If you could ever find it in your heart.
If you could ever think to find some sympathy.
Never ask us to play this song, or that song about our pants, or our Kitty-Doggie.
Never ask us to play Godzilla, or Shut Up, or a song we haven't written yet about that time we did some stuff.
I feel pretty good today,
This time I can see it.
This time when I see her face,
the words will come out right.
I comb my hair, and put on my favorite shirt.
I take one last deep breath, then I go outside...
Praise the Lord, Everybody praise. Ahhhhh. People of th earth, praise.
Give me back my sandwich!
Keith is a vegetarian,
Not vegan 'cause he drinks dairy and,
He's not like me who also eats meat.
He protests the war with the sandals on his feet.
Omnivores for mediocrity! (several times)
Helpless vegetables are trapped,
for killing only them you should be slapped.
At least a cow can run and be free,
Omnivores for mediocrity.
That tastes horrible!!!!!! (Ahhhh, my face!)
No Grandma! Know Grandma! Gnome Grandma, ahhhhhhhh.
Get patchouli.
Get the dreadlock.
Get the sandal.
Stinky hippy today.
Stinky hippy, stinky hippy.
Perspiration.<start>You're time is done, I'm moving in
I've come to fight or lose, so go ahead and try me
You know I've just begun, just begun
(Chorus:)
You've never seen a fight like this before
(Like this before)
I take you down and leave you there wanting more
(More)
You've crossed the line that I cannot ignore
(Cannot ignore)
You've never seen a fight like this before
(Yeah)
Feel the pain, I bring down on you
You won't deny my will, cause what I start I will follow through
Craving all that I can see
Making something out of me
(Chorus)<start>It's not like I wouldn't dream
If you had not shown the way
It's not like I wouldn't fight
Not knowing 'bout your life
It's not like I wouldn't stand
Right here with my friends
You threw us all alive
When our days slipped away
You gave us of your time
'Cause you are my hero
My Friday night
You wrote the soundtrack to my life
And gave me something
To hold on to
When i was growing up
You were the rock
In my life
It's not like I live my days
By every word you spoke
Like I'm up every night
Drinking with your ghost
It's not like I can't look back
Without movin' on
You threw us all alive
When our days slipped away
You gave us of your time
You are my hero
My Friday night
You wrote the soundtrack to my life
And gave us kiss
A chance to dream
Days when I had enough
You were the rock
In my life
You still throw me that like
As my days slip away
You give me of your time
You're still my hero
My Friday night
You wrote the soundtrack to my life
You give me something
To hold on to
As I'm still growing up
You are the rock
In my life<start>When it goes dark
Get me to bed
Forget the night
Wait for the light of day
Sleep till the sun
Comes into sight
CHORUS
I'm gonna capture the light
And keep it in my heart
Yeah grab on to the light
And hold it in my heart
Light and luck and love
Everybody wants
To touch the stars
Take a piece of happiness
Hold on tight
Keep trying hard
CHORUS
To capture the light
And keep it in your heart
Yeah grab on to the light
And hold it in your heart
Used to hunt for darkness
And it would follow me
Wherever I go
Now I'm looking up again
I got no more time
For feeling low
CHORUS
'Cuz I captured the light
I've got it in my heart
Grabbing on to the light
And hold it in my heart<start>I'm so small, do you think I matter at all?
When I call your name out loud
Can you hear me in the crowd?
Oh, when I look up into the starry sky, I think my, oh my
I get dizzy and weak and it makes me think
I have the life span of a fly
Can you see me breathing?
Hear me screaming
For you, for you
I'm so small but if I was a movie star
My youth would be sealed in a can on a reel
Then I could be twelve feet tall
That's why I wear my hair so big
Some people think it might be a wig
But it's all part of my plot to prove I'm not a dot
Can you see me breathing?
Hear me screaming
For you, for you
Can you see me breathing?
For you, for you
I'm so small, I am so small, I'm so small
I'm so small, I'm so small, I'm so small
I'm so small, I'm so small, I'm so small<start>I didn't mean to rip off. I thought it was a get off in mine. I tried to make the scence off. The plan was doomed to set off on time. The time that I was wastin' I spent on only chasin in the pits, and now I pay the price to make the sacrifice of the fool. I was on me. I chose not to be, cheated on part of the thrill, bargain was not fulfilled. lost in a crazy scheme that got strapped up in my dream. And now my times run out, what's it all about. Another DOA can you help me, how low can a punk get. My, My, My How low can a punk get?<start>Breathing hard. Static on the line. I'll never get enough.
Emptiness of telephonic sex.
I imagine you undressing and i can barely stand.
Turn down the lights.
Your mouth turns me to rust. So let's unwind.
I can't escape the hotline.
Take your picture. Bite you on the neck. It's all i wanna do.
Secretly romancing the recluse.
There is no touch. I am dead inside. This is all that's left.
Where are you now? I need your voice.
I've been wrapped up tight and spending all my nights...
There's not enough.
You cant stop now I'm almost there.<start>Try to piece it all together
Try to make it all make sense
Strange, my fingers seem electric
Everything is under control...
My teeth are falling out here
My lips glow in the dark
Strange, or is it paranoia?
Everything is under control...
There's something wrong with your car
There's something wrong with my head
Maybe we took this too far
Maybe we're already dead
There's something wrong with this place
There's something wrong with this bed
Don't recognize your face
Maybe we're already dead
I can't remember nothing
I can't remember who I am
Strange, the mean hallucinations
Everything is under control...
There's something wrong with your car
There's something wrong with my head
Maybe we took this too far
Maybe we're already dead
There's something wrong with this place
There's something wrong with this bed
Don't recognize your face
Maybe we're already dead<start>And now, the Reverend Abraham Meekly, saver of souls
Though they broke my legs
They gave me a crutch to walk
Though they broke my legs
They gave me a crutch to walk
Though they broke my legs
They gave me a crutch to walk
Their laws to guide me
And a crutch to walk
Brothers and sisters, I have sinned more than sinning,
I have been away these last four long years,
But now I am returned to the fold to be among my flock.
I come as humble shepherd embodied by the almighty, the power above,
The power which is in me. Because I am reborn, brothers and sisters,
I am living proof that government saves. Brothers and sisters,
I want you to show our faith in the powers that be, for we are the true believers.
I want you to come forward together, come to me, and let us feel the power of the cross.
Today's lesson, stay in your homes except on Thursday,
Do not stray from the path, as our signpost says,
You can't miss it really, and we're open all day.
Now there's no need to rush, we've got plenty of pencils for everyone.
Now there're collecting tins for ordinations, check,
Credit card facilities are payable, government savings,
Stickers and badges on sale, T-shirts in small, medium,
Or large, all at competitive prices.
Put a down-payment on your place in heaven,
And buy me another four years, brothers and sisters.
Dance wherever you may be, I am the lord of the dance said she.
And if you don't dance, we have ways of making you dance.
Government be with you!
Amen<start>Can't you feel the angst just eating at you?
Tape your knuckles for the fight
Someone said the first shall be the last
See you on the streets tonight
And if you change your mind
Here and now-with the rising tide
If you change your mind
Cast your nets on the other side<start>I dont care what people say, im gonna say what i want to say

For a little while I owned all the world
For a little while you were my girl
Then you just went away and left me behind
Now the next thing leavin' me would probably be my mind
Blue blue blue so blue but what what can I do I'm lost without you
For a little while blue was just a word
For a little while no cries would ever heard
But things are different now since you said goodbye
All the time is crying time so lonesome I could die
Blue blue blue so blue but what what can I do I'm lost without you<start>This is the story
Oh this is the way
Gospel of reason
When the pain came to stay
The life of a loser
Who wins with a smile
The sinners redemption
In the tears of a child
Me & Katie
We go dancing down the stony road
See her laughing through the pain
Of such a heavy load
Me & Katie
We go dancing down the stony road
You're looking for sugar
To kill the grey
You're looking for the laughter
To take the pain away
God don't give nothing
No you got to steal your own smile
Learning to find it,
In the tears of the child
And me & Katie
We go dancing down the stony road
See her laughing through the pain
Of such a heavy load<start>When panic grips your body and your heart is a hummingbird
Raven thoughts blacken your mind until you're breathing in reverse
All your friends and sedatives mean well, but make it worse
Every reassurance just magnifies the doubt
Better find yourself a place to level out
Got a cricket for a conscience, always looks the other way
A cocaine soul starts seeming like an empty cabaret
Hey, where have all the dancers gone? Now the music doesn't play
Tried to listen to the river but you couldn't shut your mouth
Better take a little time to level out
I never thought of running
My feet just led the way
Mixed up signals
Bullet train
Cars are switched out in the crazy rain
I could meet you any place
If the brakeman turns my way
All this automatic writing I have tried to understand
From a psychedelic angel who was tugging on my hand
It's an infinite coincidence but it doesn't form a plan
So I'm headed for New England or the Paris of the South
Going to find myself somewhere to level out
Are your brothels full, oh Babylon, with merry middlemen?
Never peer out of their periscopes from those deep opium dens
All this death must need a counterweight, always someone born again
First a mother bathes her child, then the other way around
The scales always find a way to level out
I tried to pass for nothing
But my dreams gave me away
Mixed up signals
Bullet train
People snuffed out in the brutal rain
I could live to any age
If the brakeman turns my way
It is an old world, it's hard to remember
Like a dime store mystery
I'm a repeat first time offender
Who has rewritten history
Mixed up tea leaves
Phantom pain
Fuzzy logic in the the crazy rain
Getting better every day
If the brakeman turns my way
Mixed up signals
Bullet train
Cars are switched out in the blinding rain
He'll be smiling as he seals my fate
When the brakeman turns my way<start>Aaaauuuuwww
First let me start by saying i'm sorry

Between his brain and his tail

She's standing in the hallway
Looking out on me
And nicotine stains, on her fingernails
The darkest shade of grey,
The color of her day, yeah
The painting on your walls,

You're haunted by your name,
I'm sure you've heard?
And the castles made of sand,
Sliding through my hands
The castles made of sand,
Go easy on me
We all die young..all..
And Caroline says, she is out of time
Bare feet cold, on the kitchen floor
The painting on your walls,

You're haunted by your name,

But it has gotten melded into an enharmonic whole
Consciousness has plagued us and we can not shake it
Though we think we're in control
Questions that besiege us in life
Are testament of our helplessness
"there's no vestige of a beginning,
No prospect of an end" (Hutton, 1795)
When we all disintegrate it will all happen again
Time is so rock solid in the minds of the hoards but they can't
Explain why it should slip away
History and future are the comforts of
Our curiosity but here we are
Rooted in the present day
If you came to conquer you'll be king for a day
But you too will deteriorate and quickly fade away
And believe these words you hear
When you think your path is clear

We do not understand
You have no control
You are not in command!<start>(Phone dialing)

Come on. Come with us.

Land on the earth before we crash into the ground.
Lovesick teenagers don't ever die.
They will live forever

Never carry that white flag

Know you've done no wrong
Few know sorrow as you did
You've made it, you've made it
As life dims and fades away
Like shadows in vain
And when all light is gone
I'll be there, waiting
The echoes there
Were more than most could bare
Yet no regrets at all

Thanks to Martin (tinerino@hotmail.com) for these lyrics<start>Well I've been riding a winning horse
For a long, long time
Sometimes I wonder
Is this the end of the line
No one should take advantage
Of who they are
No man has got it made
If he thinks he does, he's wrong
[Chorus]
Every mother's so
Better hear what I'm saying
Every mother's son
Will rise and fall one day
Seen it happen so many times, so many times before
Some man got so much money he doesn't worry no more
Or he's got such a pretty woman that'll treat him fine
My friends have all been fools
It happens every time
[Chorus]
I'm not tryin' to preach to no one, to no one at all
Seen a lot of my good friends just rise to fall
'Cause they got so much money or a woman so fine
Well my friends have all been fools, it happens every time
[Chorus]
What I say
[Chorus]
What I say
Oh, every mother's son will rise and fall one day
And so it goes<start>Yes
No
Beautiful eyes long gone
Beautiful eyes return
Beautiful lies set in stone
Come alive, disarm
Take my life, alter form
You look at me on the level, uh-huh
Like we got shit to settle, uh-huh
But all you do is cop like a cop
And go
Here he comes shaking his old alibi
Here he comes eating his whole pie in the sky
Beautiful eyes, strange glow
Beautiful eyes, danger zone
Beautiful eyes, undertow
Creepin' up on your soul
Ain't no time to take it slow
Look at me on the level, uh-huh
Like we got shit to settle, uh-huh
You cop like a cop in a cookie jar
Get what you what did you get it all?
Oh please, give a little back for me
Beautiful eyes, burning slow
Thousand yard stare in my horoscope
Fully loaded so unload
Can't save myself, I been told
Look at me on the level, uh-huh
Like we got shit to settle, uh-huh
Cop like a cop in a cookie jar
Get what you want? Take it all
Cop like a cop
You cop like a cop
You cop like a cop like a cop

You cop like a cop and you go go go go
You cop like a cop and you go go go go

Cop like a cop and you go go go go, oh
Won't you give a little back to me?<start>One, two
Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo huh
Yeah I know who you remind me of
A girl I think I used to know
Yeah I'd see her when the days got colder
On those days when it felt like snow
You know I even think that she stared like you
She used to just stand there and stare
And roll her eyes right up to heaven
And make like I just wasn't there
And she used to fall down a lot
That girl was always falling
Again and again
And I used to sometimes try to catch her
But never even caught her name
And sometimes we would spend the night
Just rolling about on the floor (just rolling about on the floor)
And I remember even though it felt soft at the time
I always used to wake up sore
You know I even think that she smiled like you
She used to just stand there and smile
And her eyes would go all sorts of far away
And stay like that for quite a while
And I remember she used to fall down a lot
That girl was always falling
Again and again
And I used to sometimes try to catch her
But never even caught her name
Yes, I sometimes even tried to catch her
But never even caught her name<start>I looked out this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away
It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
Till I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away
So many people have come and gone
Their faces fade as the years go by
Yet I still recall as I wander on
As clear as the sun in the summer sky
It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
Till I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away
When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
And dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away
She slipped away
It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
Till I see Marianne walk away<start>[Chorus:]
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars
[Verse 1]
I see this life
Like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I feel something so right
By doing the wrong thing
And I feel something so wrong
By doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
[Chorus:]
Lately I been, I been losing sleep (hey!)
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard (hey!)
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately I been, I been losing sleep (hey!)
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard (hey!)
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
[Verse 2:]
I feel the love
And I feel it burn
Down this river every turn
Hope is our four letter word
Make that money
Watch it burn
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
And I feel something so wrong
By doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly
[Chorus:]
Lately I been, I been losing sleep (hey!)
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately I been, I been losing sleep (hey!)
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard (hey!)
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
Oh, oh, oh.
[Bridge 4x:]
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I learned
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
[Chorus:]
Lately I been, I been losing sleep (hey!)
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard (hey!)
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
[Outro 4x:]
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I learned<start>Fake light from the sun
it's driving me mad
it's poisoned our good name
somebody said
the sky's turning red
no one can be trusted
I want you to know that the sky's full of wires
fake light from the sun
it's all in my mind
your nature is so kind
this water taste better when I have been fooled
your absence is so cruel
nobody can know
I just want control
I see enemies always
they hide in the trees
insidious fleas cause cancer in strange ways
I want you to know that the sky's full of wires
fake light from the sun
it's all in my mind your nature is so kind
this water taste better when I have been fooled
your absence is so cruel
I want you to know that the sky's full of wires
fake light from the sun
it's all in my mind your nature is so kind
this water taste better when I have been fooled
your absence is so cruel<start>Evening Comes
Cliff Richard
Sun sets, night falls
Ending of the day, time to slip away into sad dreams
Night falls
Dreams would all come true if I were with you, my princess
Evening comes what to do, my love, without you, my love
Evening comes gone the dreams of day, they just slip away
The stars have lost their glow, the moon beam seem to know
That somewhere, somehow, Ill find you by God it be right now
But right now
The evening comes with the thoughts it brings, oh a thousand things
Evening comes what to do, my love, without you, my love
Evening comes what to do, my love, without you, my love
My love<start>What will you do when you get lonely
With nobody waitin' by your side?
You've been running and hiding much to long
You know it's just your foolish pride
[Chorus: Repeat 3X]
Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind
Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging darling please
Let's make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please don't say we'll never find a way
And tell me all --- my love's in vain
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]<start>I've been out
On my own for so long
I can feel the cold wind
Wearing me down
I'm blowin away
And lightning strikes me
There's a whole lot of craziness
In this town
Shadowrealm
Inside this head of mine
It's getting scarier
And harder with time
Met a lover
Put my money on the long shot
Came out smelling like a dog
And not feeling so hot
I'll take anything that you've got
Anything you've got
Madeline
Madeline
Just save me from myself
Gas station prophet
Kept giving me the sign
Saying tell it like it is
Lay it on the line
This simple life
Holds no reason
You play the game
And turn the dial
Alligator shoes
Tarantula breath
It looked good on paper (in the darkness)
Now it's scaring me to death
I'm all wrung out
And nowhere to go
Feel like a second string
Romeo<start>Now we take our time
So nonchalant
And spend our nights
So Bon vivant
We dress our days
In silken robes
The money comes
The money goes
We know it's all a passing phase,
We light our lamps
For atmosphere
And hang our hopes
On chandeliers
We're going long
We're gaining weight
We're sleeping long
And far too late
And so it's times
To change our ways
But I've loved these days.
Now as we indulge
In things refined
We hide our hearts
From harder times
A string of pearls
A foreign car
Oh we can only go so far
On caviar and Cabernay.
We drown our doubts
In dry champagne
And soothe our souls
With fine cocaine
I don't know why I ever care
We'll get so high
And get nowhere
We'll have to change our jaded ways,
But I've loved these days.<start>MinÃ¤ vajoon teidÃ¤n lattiaan, tÃ¤nÃ¤ aamuna

About our state of affairs
Hey hey, what do you say?
Are you ready to go?
Go! go! go! go!
If you think that everything's ok then go on home and lock your brain away
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Are you ready? Ready!
Hey hey, what do you say?
About our state of affairs
Hey hey, what are we for?
Are you ready for war?
Fight! fight! fight! fight!
Now's the time to defend your worthless life!
Are you going to kill, or be liked?
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Are you ready? Ready! To die?<start>I wish I had cheated
At least that's a reason
I'd understand why you're leaving now
We both stopped breathing
It could not last
I guess I'm just afraid to ask
But what if you don't?
What if you stay and
Break your plans tonight
Lay your hand in mine
There's no guarantee we'll make it, make this thing right
But break your plans for me tonight
Tonight
You call this closure
It's barely over
How do you move on so fast?
Maybe there's someone
Maybe it's all gone
I guess I'm just afraid to look back
But all that counts
Is what comes next
Break your plans tonight
Lay your hand in mine
There's no guarantee we'll make it, make this thing right
Break your plans for me tonight
And I know better
Than to stay just wondering for it
Will you stay and be with me?
Break your plans tonight
Lay your hand in mine
There's no guarantee we'll make it, no guarantee we'll make it
Just break your plans tonight
Lay your hand in mine
There's no guarantee we'll make it, no guarantee we'll make it
Just break your plans for me tonight<start>Maybe I'll call, and then maybe I won't
ever be there, I know you need me,
I don't know no one like you do.
So I'm taking my time, taking some time alone,
time I realised the pain I'm feeding,
I don't know no one like you do.
If I'd known you'd follow,
I'd be there 'til the end,
and just give me strength if you can,
And I've no sorrow I'll be feeling in the end,
and just give me strength if you can.
So I wrote out a list of all that I've ever done,
all that I miss is there to meet me,
I don't know no one like you do.
And I'll never be there,
and I'll never let you know
I'll ever care about your feeling,
I don't know no one like you do.
If I'd known you'd follow,
I'd be there 'til the end,
and just give me strength if you can,
If I'd known the sorrow I'd be feeling in the end,
and just give me strength again,
c'mon and give me strength for all I've done,
just give me strength to go on.
Happiness take my hand, I'll be alone until you understand
all that I want now our love has gone,
Happiness take my hand, I'll be alone until she'd understand
what good that I know you're out the door.
Now if I'd known you'd follow,
I'd be there 'til the end,
just give me strength if you can.
If I'd have known this, God would have jumped up, get in line,
and just give me strength again,
c'mon, just give me strength for all I've done,
Just give me strength.<start>Well we started shooting hoops,
Now we're sipping Black and Tans
From the park to the pub
Was the course we ran.
The times have changed, but friends remain
My heart and soul's with you
Cause one thing's for sure, i always swore,
I'd never turn my back on you-
Never turned our backs,
Stuck together through and through,
The times have changed,
But my heart and soul's with you
Wouldn't turn your backs
And you didn't walk away
We'd never run,
We'd stand as one,
And this is what we'd say:
[Chorus]
Times were tough,
But the memories remain
Situations rough,
But we overcame.
Side by side, one for all,
Together we grew
Cause when it's said and done,
I'll look back on friends like you
When I was down and I was out
And no one liked my games,
One too many fights and bloody night
For which i was to blame
But you wouldn't turn your backs
And you didn't walk away
Cause we'd never run We'd stand as one
Until this very day
Never turn our backs
Together through and through
The times have changed,
But my heart and soul's with you
Wouldn't turn your backs
And you didn't walk away
We'd never run, we'd stand as one
Until this very day
[Chorus: x2]<start>Why do we never get an answer
When we`re knocking at the door
With a thousand million questions
About hate and death and war?
`cuz when we stop and look around us
There is nothing that we need
In a world of persecution
That is parting in its greed
Why do we never get an answer
When we`re knocking at the door?
Because the truth is hard to swallow
It`s like a wall of blood before...
It`s not the way that you say it when you do those things to me
It`s more the way that you mean it when you tell me what will be and when you stop and think about it
You won`t believe it`s true
That all the love you`ve been giving
Has all been meant for you I`m looking for someone to change my life
I`m looking for a miracle in my life
But if you could see what it`s done to me
To lose the love I knew
That safely leads me through...
Between the silence of the mountains and the crashing of the sea
There lies a land I once lived in
And she`s waiting there for me
But in the grey of the morning
My mind becomes confused
Between the dead, and the sleeping,
And the road that I must choose
I`m looking for someone to change my life
I`m looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see what it`s done to me
To lose the love I knew
Could safely lead me to
The land that I once knew
The land as we grow old
The secrets of our soul
It`s not the way that you say it when you do those things to me
It`s more the way you really mean it when you tell me what will be
Why do we never get an answer
When we`re knocking at the door?
With a thousand million questions
About hate and death and war
But when we stop and look around us
There is nothing that we need
In a world of persecution
That is parting in its greed<start>Four walls I built one winter
She came to share my name
For years we lived as lovers on the open plains
Far off the heat wave shimmers
Pipelines and the gasoline
One day it all came running like a bad dream
Fire, smoke-filled lungs
I hope I'll be standing when the day is done
We're
Staring out at the red plains
And we're hiding out from the smoke and the rage
A lifetime living on the red plains
Watching out as it all goes up in flames
Get up on Sunday morning
Repent for Friday night
Don't let 'em tell you it's gonna be a fair fight
I gave her clothes and a diamond
She loved the things that shine
But one day the gold and the silver get left behind
Fire, smoke-filled rooms
I hope I'll be standing when the day is through
Staring out at the red plains
And we're hiding out from the smoke and the rage
A lifetime living on the red plains
Watching out as it all goes up in flames<start>Fuera sopla el viento fuera estÃ¡ lloviendo
Un aullido aterrador
Y yo te observo mientras duermes, respirando dulcemente
En la calma de esta habitaciÃ³n
Todo lo que siento llueve desde dentro
Aguacero de electricidad
Y al besarte en la majilla, yo creÃ­ que me morÃ­a
Se rompÃ­a este pobre corazÃ³n
Quiero besarte
Tengo miedo a despertarte
Entro en tu sueÃ±o, y te grito desde lejos
Que te quiero
En sÃ³lo un segundo
He comprendido lo que importa y lo que no
El fin del mundo, la tormenta, el dolor
Quedan muy lejos de esta habitaciÃ³n
Fuera sopla el viento, fuera estÃ¡ lloviendo
Un aullido aterrador
Pero un susurro nos envuelve, nos abraza lentamente
Como un mantra conocido por los dos
No son fantasmas
Es mi espÃ­ritu el que habla
Entra en tu sueÃ±o y te grita desde lejos
Que te quiero
En sÃ³lo un segundo
He comprendido lo que importa y lo que no
El fin del mundo, la tormenta, el dolor
Quedan muy lejos de esta habitaciÃ³n
Quiero besarte
Tengo miedo a despertarte
Entro en tu sueÃ±o y te grito desde lejos
Que te quiero
En sÃ³lo un segundo
He comprendido lo que importa y lo que no
Los desengaÃ±os y los malos presagios
Las envidias, las intrigas, que complican nuestras vidas
Quedan, quedan muy lejos de esta pompa de jabÃ³n
Nuestra burbuja de amor
Sube por el cielo, mÃ¡s allÃ¡ del universo
Sube y estalla en tu sueÃ±o<start>Calling, distorting
Reach the ends for you
Burn a hole right through
Talking, we keep talking
Filling empty space
In this lonely frame
As the image fades in to one
Today it all feels fine
A sense of freedom fills your mind
Can't think about tomorrow
Just breathe the air inside
And bring on back that lonely smile
Can't think about tomorrow
Twisting, constricted
On the edge for you
You know I'd jump right through
Falling, we keep stalling
I can see the ground
Someplace new to land
As the image fades into one
Today it all feels fine
A sense of freedom fills your mind
Can't think about tomorrow
Just breathe the air inside
And bring on back that lonely smile
Can't think about tomorrow
Can't think about tomorrow
Because you, feel yourself
Fall apart again
You hold your face inside your aching hands
The angels tears come flooding down again
Bring us back again
Yearning, returning
To this empty street
As the city sleeps
Tearing, despairing
As the day comes in
As the morning sings
As the image fades into one
Today it all feels fine
A sense of freedom fills your mind
Can't think about tomorrow
Just breathe the air inside
And bring on back that lonely smile
Can't think about tomorrow
Today it all feels fine
A sense of freedom fills your mind
Can't think about tomorrow
Can't think about tomorrow<start>They found Mary Bellows cuffed tot he bed
With a rag in her mouth and a bullet in her head
O poor Mary Bellows
She'd grown up hungry, she'd grown up poor
So she left her home in Arkansas
O poor Mary Bellows
She wanted to see the deep blue see
She drove across Tennessee
O poor Mary Bellows
She met a man along the way
He introduced himself as Richard Slade
O poor Mary Bellows
Poor Mary thought that she might die
When she saw the ocean for the first time
O poor Mary Bellows
She checked into a cheap little place
Richard Slade carried in her old suitcase
O poor Mary Bellows
'I'm a good girl, sir," she said to him
I couldn't possibly permit you in
O poor Mary Bellows
Slade tipped his hat and winked his eye
And turned away without goodbye
O poor Mary Bellows
She sat on her bed and thought of home
With the sea breeze whistling all alone
O poor Mary Bellows
In hope and loneliness she crossed the floor
And undid the latch on the front door
O poor Mary Bellows
They found her the next day cuffed to the bed
A rag in her mouth and a bullet in her head
O poor Mary Bellows
So mothers keep your girls at home
Don't let them journey out alone
Tell them the world is full of danger
And to shun the company of strangers
O poor Mary Bellows
O poor Mary Bellows<start>In demon days, it's cold inside
You don't get nobody, people sigh
It's so bad, lasting far, but love yourself
Hiding in a hole in there
All the glasses are too big
Bring it back, got to hold it back
To let you do that yet you don't want me back
Before it fall down, falling down falling down
Falling out to go far from the soul
Well these demon days are so cold inside
It's so hard to live, and so to survive
You can't even trust the air you breathe
'Cause Mother Earth has a soul to leave
When lies become reality
You love yourself because it's easy
Pick yourself up it's a brand new day
So turn yourself round
Don't burn yourself, turn yourself
Turn yourself around to the soul
Well these demon days are so cold inside
It's so hard to live, and so to survive
You can't even trust the air you breathe
'Cause Mother Earth has a soul to leave
When lies become reality
You love yourself because it's easy
Pick yourself up it's a brand new day
So turn yourself round
Don't burn yourself, turn yourself
Turn yourself around to the soul

You gotta get behind the wheel?

'Cause tonight, you're alive

What about now?
You wanna start a fight?
You gotta take the swing
Gotta get your hands in the dirt
To see what the harvest will bring
You wanna raise your voice?

Don't be afraid to hurt
Don't ashamed in need

For the faceless and the teacher
Stand up and be proud
What about now?
Believe for that reason that dream through the seasons
'Till dreams are just fade dark and grey
And all of your plans that slip out through your hands
Are the dreams that you take to your grave
Tonight, you're alive
Who stand for the restless?
And the lonely?, For the desperate?, And the hungry?

What about now?<start>With the sweet drip of every raindrop
Time brings you closer to me
And with each new sign at every train-stop
Another hour without you is consigned to history
And with each tick of my alarm clock
I get crazy for the days to get to you
When I can hold you and kiss you and have you
Instead of staring at some photo like a fool
But as day turns to night there's this hopelessness to fight
When I think that I might not make it through
But honey sometimes I just have to say your name
To hear it hanging in the air, to know it sounds the same
And sometimes when I'm blue, I know just what to do
To keep the blues at bay you know I only have to say your name
So this morning I picked up the paper
In the useless descent of the rain
While partners in heartbreak the whole world over
Lie and cheat just the same
And the headlines proclaim everything has changed
Love can't save you now
As each little motion of my writswatch
Holds up my faith somehow
But as day turns to night there's this hopelessness to fight
When I think that I might not make it through
But honey sometimes I just have to say your name
To hear it hanging in the air, to know it sounds the same
And sometimes when I'm blue, I know just what to do
To keep the blues at bay you know I only have to say your name
When I've used up all my patience
When your letters have been read twenty times through
I can drink all the wine in this place of mine
But it ain't no replacement
It ain't no replacement for you<start>She broke down and let me in
Made me see where I've been
Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again
You don't know what it means to win
Come down and see me again
Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again<start>Sophisticated lady tryin' to change my ways

You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone<start>Walking alone in the rain
Water in my shoes
All I can feel is this pain in my heart
And these Muddy Water Blues
River weep for me
Got nothing left to loose
Under the weeping willow tree
With these Muddy Water Blues
Muddy Water Blues
Muddy Water Blues
Muddy Water Blues
Ooh, tell me to lose
Try to get free from you, baby
Oh, but I'm stuck like glue
Try to get free from you, baby
No one else but you
(No one else)
Hey, yeah
Muddy Water Blues
Muddy Water Blues
I got the Muddy Water Blues, yeah, yeah
Somebody tell me, tell me to lose
The women and whiskey will frame you
It's no good you're looking for clues
You got them bad and who can blame you?
Muddy Water Blues, hey, yeah
Muddy Water Blues
Tell me now, Muddy Water Blues
I got the Muddy Water Blues
Hey, hey, hey, now tell me to lose
Muddy, Muddy Water Blues
Yeah, Muddy my Water Blues
You got the Muddy Water Blues
Tell me, tell me, tell me to lose
(Tell me to lose)<start>After the torchlight red on our pale faces.
After the frosty silence of agony.
Prison and reverberation (of tears) over distant blood.
What is that sound low in the air (murmur) of maternal lamentation ?
Who are these hordes swarming over endless plains - ringed in fire ?
What is the city over the mountains dressed in violet air ?
Falling towers of CANAAN unreal.<start>Sometimes you're sad and you don't know why
You sit under the stars and you almost cry
It's at times like these you know I'm lonely and I wanna die
And you're looking for a cigarette to ease your pain
And your life's a drag and you work in vain
Burn down your office and walk out into the rain
Life is short you gotta look around
Pretty soon you'll be all grown up
With dead-eyed kids and a life of hell
Stick with me and you'll feel swell
Lonely heart company
Selling shares in sympathy
Lonely hearts company
Share with me your misery
Well I don't like to smoke 'cause it takes your cash
And I don't roll notes 'cause I ain't that flash
But at times like these you know I feel like getting trashed
Yet the thing about you is that you see me through
And I can sit around and just talk to you
This world is such a cynical place, people can be so cruel
Life is short you gotta look around
Pretty soon you'll be all grown up
With dead-eyed kids and a life of hell
Stick with me and we'll feel swell
Lonely heart company
Selling shares in sympathy
Lonely hearts company
Share with me your misery X2<start>Carry me, angel please far from here
And I wont fall from you
Aim at me, let your arrow fly
I'm not afraid to die
I wanna know a cost worth paying for
I wanna feel lost in you
I wanna know there's more worth dying for
I wanna know more
Lay with me, make these demons disappear
whispering in my ear
Stay with me, maybe I'll get a full nights sleep
if you'll stay next to me<start>Sunday nights that you want her like velvet cake
Sweet heart can bargain half price mistakes
She will go down with her ship like a good captain
You're sitting on the dock playing for an audience of one
Pacing your apartment, linoleum floors
Get a call from an old friend, she never liked him before
He will drive all over three lanes, you sit tight, shotgun
Windshield wipers waving for an audience of one
You came out from the country wearing mama's clothes
You were born in the city with daddy's domino's
You need a record you can move to, well, we got one
Drop the needle, we are playing for an audience of one
Drop the needle, we are playing for an audience of one
One gets all of you, two's jealous, three gets even less
Four divides you up then you're left pleasing all your guests<start>Where's the love song to set us free
Too many people down
Everything turning the wrong way round
And I don't know what life would be
If we stop dreaming now
Lord knows we'd never clear the clouds
And you've been so busy lately that you haven't found the time
To open up your mind
And watch the world spinning gently out of time
Feel the sunshine on your face
It's on a computer now
Gone to the future way out in space
And you've been so busy lately that you haven't found the time
To open up your mind
And watch the world spinning gently out of time
And you've been so busy lately that you haven't found the time
To open up your mind
And watch the world spinning gently out of time<start>all the thoughts i can't erase
seem to wind up on your face
propelling me to outer space
press the backspace key of time
all the words i can't define
i'll sing in an old fashioned line:
na na na na, na na
we should be...
na, na na na na, na na
every day, every...
na, na na na na, na na
everything we'll ever be
na, na na na na, na na
i could rip this world into
tiny fragments made of blue
if it would bring me back to you
on the footsteps of your mind
there is nothing left to find
no signs of reason left behind
na na na na, na na
we should be...
na, na na na na, na na
every day, every...
na, na na na na, na na
everything we'll ever be
na, na na na na, na na<start>Oh gentlemen
Swallow your prayers
Because the wind makes a mockery of men
Your soul becomes a fish
You swim in idle waters
And drink other fishes piss
Your soul feeds on fish
On piss, puss and men
Who in turn, become as you have become
A fish
No, not even that, but a symbol of fish
Hooked by the baby flesh of maggots
A ripple of life in tin
This tin could become your world too
So choose between this and water
Choose between tin and piss
Do you still feel thirsty now
Are you thirsty now
Are you thirsty now
Do you still feel
Thirsty
Thirsty now<start>Whoa
Hey ya
All 'tis time this life
Is a rhythm without a rhyme
'Cause it makes me feel, uh
I'm like a train without a wheel, whoa
You got me down, so low
I gotta be tough, won't touch the ground, ah
But - I'm alright
I won't give up without a fight
If you don't want to realize
That I would never compromise my
Integrity or my right to be free
There's nothing left for me to say
'Cause
Yo trippin'
There ain't nothing wrong
With the way I sing my song
Yo trippin'
Why you make me feel
Like my feelings ain't so real
Yo trippin'
There ain't nothing wrong
With the way I sing my song
Hey, whoa
Yo trippin'
Why you feel (why you feel, why you feel)
That to be cruel
Is to be real, yeah
Honesty (honesty, yeah, honesty)
Is how I live
But you refuse to see that
You'll never win the game of life
Ask why
You live in sin
From telling all those lies
Can't live in peace
Your heart won't let me free
There's nothing left for me to say, yeah
Yo trippin'
There ain't nothing wrong
With the way I sing my song
Yo trippin'
Why you make me feel
Like my feelings ain't so real
Yo trippin'
There ain't nothing wrong
With the way I sing my song
Whoa
Yo trippin'
Yeah
Why you always trippin' on me?
Yo trippin'
There ain't nothing wrong
With the way I sing my song

Why you make me feel
Like my feelings ain't so real
Yo trippin'
There ain't nothing wrong

Baby why you always
Trippin baby

Whoa

You're almost someone else now
Perfect
perfect as I want it to be
you were everything to me for a time...
Fuck no hard feelings
All I got is hard feelings, you know?
Get so emotional after you go and hope I'm not approachable so?<start>She had that
Camarillo brillo
Flamin out along her head,
I mean her mendocino bean-o
By where some bugs had made it red
She ruled the toads
Of the short forest
And every newt in idaho
And every cricket who had chorused
By the bush in buffalo
She said she was
A magic mama
And she could throw a mean tarot
And carried on without a comma
That she was someone I should know
She had a snake for a pet
And an amulet
And she was breeding a dwarf
But she wasn't done yet
She had gray-green skin
A doll with a pin
I told her she was awright
But I couldnt come in
(I couldnt come in right then...)
And so she wandered
Trough the door-way
Just like a shadow from the tomb
She said her stereo was four-way
An I'd just love it in her room
Well, I was born
To have adventure
So I just followed up the steps
Right past her fuming incense stencher
To where she hung her castanets
She stripped away
Her ranchid poncho
An laid out naked by the door
We did it till we were un-concho
An it was useless any more
She had a snake for a pet
And an amulet
And she was breeding a dwarf
But she wasn't done yet
She had gray-green skin
A doll with a pin
I told her she was awright
But I couldnt come in
(actually, I was very busy then)
And so she wandered
Trough the door-way
Just like a shadow from the tomb
She said her stereo was four-way
An I'd just love it in her room
Well, I was born
To have adventure
So I just followed up the steps
Right past her fuming incense stencher
To where she hung her castanets
She said she was
A magic mama
And she could throw a mean tarot
And carried on without a comma
That she was someone I should know
Is that a real poncho...i mean
Is that a mexican poncho
Or is that a sears poncho?
Hmmm...no foolin ...<start>You play the fool again
And hide behind your friends
You say you walked away
But that's not on your face
You're waiting for the sign
To leave them all behind
You shudder all the way
And wonder what they'll say
You have your chance
To wash the stars away
But it's too late
Everybody
Wants to touch your hand
But don't you worry
About the talk behind your back
'til it's too late
Now you're bracing for the fall
They're blinded by it all
You're frozen by the fear
Of what they want to hear
You had your chance
To wash the stars away
But it's too late
Everybody
Wants to touch your hand
But don't you worry
About the talk behind your back
You're all alone now
Living in the past
'now it's too late
Fast as they can
Slipped from your hands
And left you bare
Now yesterday is all you have
But it's too late
Now you're too late
Everybody
Wants to touch your hand
But don't you worry
About the talk behind your back
You're all alone now
Living in the past
Now you're too late
And everyone who touched your hands
Now it's too late
Is talking now behind your back
Now it's too late
Alone and living in the past
Now you're too late<start>When I was born the world tried to keep me down
all the way, all the way, all the way
before I could even walk
When I could stand the back hand swung at me
all the way, all the way, all the way
until I could fight it off
Oh No
What do you want from me? What do you want from me?
Just can't leave it alone
Oh No
Why do you follow me? Why do you follow me?
Can't seem to let it go!
It's not the way you wanted
It's not the way it goes
It's not the way (you saw it)?
knock me down I get back on the road
Young in the sun
My feet (front?)as I go
all the way, all the way, all the way
Still got along way to go
Home in the sand the grown man battling
all the way, all the way, all the way
Nothings gonna make me (slow)?
Oh No
What do you want from me? What do you want from me?
Just can't leave it alone
Oh No
Why do you follow me? Why do you follow me?
Can't seem to let it go!<start>Whooo ... wheee!
You there, comin' up the stair, the feelin' is ice-blue cold.
Shake, it's more than I can take, I'm startin' to lose control.
Watch out, what's that noise, there's somebody at the door.
It must be black licorice, she come back to make me cry some more.
Time, ain't on my side, I'm losin' it more each day.
Licorice, licorice.
She's got evil in her eyes, and catnip is her taste.
Licorice, licorice.
She wraps me up in her slender legs, her hot black skin to mine.
Licorice, licorice.
Ple ... ple ...please, don't touch me, oh, I know I'm dead this time.
Oh, oh, yeah ... licorice, yeah, black licorice.

I wish I knew where I'd been
I don't need you
I don't need you
The lights are going down
Look at us we're fading out
It's been good to have you
The look across your face
Distorted, crushed and hazy eyed
Go fuck your white lies
You strung me all for this time
I won't wait, I won't wait
You dragged me back without mine
I won't fall down
I wish I knew where I came from
I wish I knew where I'd been
I don't need you
I don't need you
The lights are going down
Look at us we're fading out
It's been good to have you
The look across your face
Distorted, Fucked and hazy eyed
Go fuck your white lies
Just look away
Oh..
And I'll be there
You find<start>(instrumental)<start>It's a chilly Florentine evening
Two men in evening hats
Telling tales of the underground and
Fishing for Reds
Policemen armed with Uzis
Stand guard but they don't speak
Ain't seen no Michaeangelo
He'll be here next week.
The girl in the shoes
With the crystal heels went chaperoned by her brother
They raise a glass of amber wine
Take pictures of each other
Of the policemen in the fountains
And the sickle and the hammer
And they came with Uncle Romulus
With his walking cane and camera
She looked like someone's girlfriend
She looked like a dream
She looked as unlikely
As the people's limousine.
Come and sit by me, girl, before I breathe the breath out of you
Hush your mouth and cover your eyes for I'll tell your father of you
He paid to have you painted in the company of angels
Only to find you flirting anew with Chico Marx and perverted Engels
The patron saint of television smiles down from the shelf
Romulus can't criticize but he can't bless himself
He has a tin of pea-green paint and a big roll of black tape
To vandalize these obscenities then make his escape<start>No need to be here anymore
My door to heaven's finally come
Can't stick around for the parade
It's time to end this fool's crusade
THIS IS WHAT I WAITED FOR!
Take this home for me, take this home for me
SHAKE MY HAND FOR I WILL GO!
Take this home for me, take this home for me
I'll climb the ladder to the door
Peer inside to watch the show
And cleanse this world off of my skin
For then I've found what lies within
THIS IS WHAT I WAITED FOR!
Take this home for me, take this home for me
SHAKE MY HAND FOR I WILL GO!
Take this home for me, take this home for me
(I have seen the revelations
Seen the gardens of faith
I could tell you such stories
That I snatched from the grave)
Ballast undone
And free to go
Unnecessarily flawed my soul
(I can leave)
(YEAH!!)
I've watched me coming down
On the way of enternity
So - why - am - I - not - quite - at - EASE
THIS I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR???!!!
Take this home for me, take this home for me
TAKE MY HAND AND TAKE ME HOME!!!
Take this home for me, take this home for me<start>Oi oi oi!
We are the fuckin' punx the the fuckin' streets
We are the fuckin' punx that make you get down on you're knees
You want to fuck with us well we will meet you on the streets
[Chorus]
Just so you fuckin' no there is no way out
No way out!
O fucking way out!
Oi oi oi
Oi oi oi
Oi oi oi!!
You fucking crazy from head to toe
Your fuckin' crazy I just want you to no
Your fucking crazy
That's what I say
Your fuckin' crazy

Still looking for love
Everything we do is in search of it
Everything we say or think of
And every time we reach for somebody
We're reaching out for love
Everybody's looking for love
Everybody is looking for love
When someone says a kind word
It's music to your ears
Yet somewhere inside you're wondering
If you really deserve to let go of your fears
You want to make a connection, you're looking for a way
To escape the loneliness and the tears
That you've had for years
Everybody's looking for love
Everybody is looking for love
But you know you gotta
Hold out, don't settle for less
Hold out for the real thing, hold out for the real thing
Hold out, you deserve the best
Hold out for the real thing, hold out for the real thing
Hold out for love
Maybe you're looking for security
But without a doubt
You're gonna miss the love you wish you had
'Cause love is what life is all about
Well, if it don't feel right, then don't do it
If the night is dark, don't sell your soul to get through it
Listen to your heart, it'll tell you how to do it
Love will be worth the wait
Everybody's looking for love
Everybody is looking for love
But you know you gotta
Hold out, don't settle for less
Hold out for the real thing, hold out for the real thing
Hold out, you deserve the best
Hold out for the real thing, hold out for the real thing
Hold out for love<start>I've never done anything strange
I'm just alive
I never got nowhere great
By surprise
All I do is silly things
With my life
I'm sorry already but
I think I'll survive
I have to walk
Though I'm gonna fall down again
The same as always
But I stay tough
Hope I'm gonna rise and remain
To swim through the rain
Once again
Its nice to see the girls swirl
Like flies around you
You say you don't notice, but
Well, I'm sure you do
And its funny to see you father
Grow physically through you
You way you want action but
You've got too much to lose
If you don't choose to
Walk
How are you gonna fall down again
And learn something, oh
Life's insane
Hope you're gonna rise and remain
To swim through the rain

Ayreon, don't you know who I am

It wasn't hard to kill the confidence
So scared we'd never be the same again
So afraid
I can't feel the love again
You thought I couldn't feel it in your kiss
Betrayed yourself with broken promises
It's everywhere it's in the air I breathe
And it's killing me
And it's killing me
It's killing me.
When everything is wasted
Everything is rushed
And your heart is broken
Lying in the dust
There's no way to change it
Time is running out
I don't wanna feel this
All we need is a little forgiveness
A little forgiveness
A little forgiveness
A little forgiveness
There's nothing that I wouldn't sacrifice
To take away the sadness in your eyes
To hear you whisper "I'm the only one"
But the trust is gone
And the trust is gone
I tried to keep it all inside of me
I didn't wanna be your enemy
No it's everywhere
It's in the air I breathe
And it's killing me
And it's killing me
It's killing me
I would swallow down my pride
And let go if I can make a difference
Keep on going though
It's hard to breathe
I don't even know what's real
I would swallow down my pride
And let go if I can make a difference
No, no, is truth really worth the fault.
If you were never sorry at all.
oh mmmm yeah
When everything is wasted
Everything is rushed
And your heart is broken lying in the dust

No more crying on her shoulder

Waiting for godot hell

I hate the things I think about you
When I'm all alone
I know you're tough
But I've been gone
For so long
I play the memories of you
Inside my head
So all those pictures of us
Burn and radiate
Watch the clouds, and I'm falling
Falling through the cracks
Head beats

Off the ground
Into the starry dark, into your arms
I'm falling

And my world is pale
When a blind man cries
Lord you know, there ain't no sadder tale
Had a friend once, in a room
Had a good time,
But it ended much too soon
In a cold month, in that room
We found a reason for the things
We had to do

I'm a blind man
I'm a blind man
Now my room is cold

Lord you know, he feels it in his soul<start>You wake up late day is still dawning
You get out on the road
You meet up with a man his face is well worn in
He's carrying a load
On the way to paradise
Summer rain falls, so you head for some shelter
Close to a wall
See a lady dressed in chance you try to help her
She heeds your call
On the way to paradise
Ornamental or warm and gentle
On the way to paradise asyou will someday
You find a hidden door that leads to a garden
And venture through
Sunshines bright a witness to pardon
The world that you knew
On the way to paradise
All is well on the distant horizon
It's there in wait
Get so close, you grow so much wiser
But wake up late
On the way to paradise
Ornamental or warm and gentle
Can you tell heaven from hell
As you will someday<start>Imagine me
And you, I do
I dream about you
Day and night
It's only right
To dream about the girl
You love
And hold her tight
So happy together
If I should call you up
And pass the time
Have you say
You belong to me
And ease my mind
Imagine how the world
Could be so very fine
So happy together
I can't see me
Loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me
Baby
The skies'll be blue
For all my life
Me and you
And you and me
No matter how
They toss the dice
It has to be
The only one for me
Is you
And you for me
So happy together
I can't see me
Loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me
Baby
The skies'll be blue
For all my life
So happy together
So happy together
So happy together<start>Wildflowers grow everywhere
Vibrations flow, things will have to change
(good evening, madam. it's a recording. yes.)
Strange new ideas fill the air
Some people leave, others grieve
Some were bare but things will change
Old concepts go, new ones grow
All at once the world begins to love again
(..... hello uncle bill)
And the wildflowers grow out of fields
Fields of people
There's no such thing as a weed
Seeds of hatred
Plant them and soon they will breed

Such change of heart
Now I can't stand to be around you
I can't bear to be this near to you
Don't believe a word I say
Repeat x 4<start>My mind tells me, what will be, shall be
Not a thing I can do about it
'Cause in my heart, I can't do without it

And I'm trying to get through to you, baby
I've got my heart on ice and it's about to freeze, yeah
Only you can pull me through
'Cause I want some of your unusual heat, yeah
And I need more and more, unusual heat
My body tells me, hold on, I gotta hold on
But I'm so cold and hungry
All stretched out like a month of Sundays
I've been out of my head from that very first day
Searchin' for somebody like you
I've been stumblin' around, every step of the way, alright
And only you can pull me through
'Cause I want some of your unusual heat, yeah
And I need more and more, unusual heat, yeah, yeah
I need it every way, every minute of the day
Baby, I'm yours, I'll do anything you say
If you just give me some of your warm unusual heat, yeah
It's so cold out here, I'm about to freeze
But I'm still trying to get through to you
I've got my heart on ice, oh baby please, please, please
Only you can pull me through
'Cause I want some of your unusual heat, yeah
And I need more and more, unusual heat, oh
I need it every way, every minute of the day
Baby, I'm yours, I'll do anything you say
If you just give me some of your warm
Baby, won't you keep me warm with your unusual heat, yeah
Unusual, unusual heat, yeah, yeah<start>I want you to hit it

Good God, hit it and quit it
I want you to, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You can shake it to the east
Shake it to the west, hit it
Good God, hit it and quit it
Yeah, all up and down

You can shake it for dinner
Or you could spread it all around, hit it

Eve taught him sin, that's the way it all began
But every time you kiss me, my heart pounds like a drum
So trouble is a woman, trouble here I come
I'm lonely like Adam, you're evil like Eve
I shouldn't take forbidden fruit 'cause I believe
I'll be heading straight for heartache
I should cut loose and run
But if loving you means heartache
Heartache, here I come
You're not the angel that I dreamed about
But you're the devil I don't want to live without
A woman's a woman, a man is a man
I can't be free I'm just putty in your hands
Who cares about tomorrow, I need your love tonight
And even if you're evil, baby hold me tight (Hold me tight)
You're not the angel that I dreamed about
But you're the devil I don't want to live without
A woman's a woman, a man is a man
I can't be free I'm just putty in your hands
Who cares about tomorrow, I need your love tonight
And baby if you're evil, baby hold me tight (Hold me tight)
Hold me tight (Hold me tight)
Hold me tight (Hold me tight)
Hold me tight (Hold me tight)<start>Every time you come around
There's another bouquet for me
A corsage of promises and I am pinned
Like a butterfly on a card
Now I'm naked and I'm scarred
And you're so perfect to me
Violent eyes but hands like a steeple
Tell me lies with a tongue like a needle
And every word's shot down my throat
A face like an iron fist
That I could never resist
I learned it all by rote
Words of wisdom, from your tyrant mouth
I'm stuck just like a pig
Roasting in your eyes
I'll believe anything that you want
You better teach me how to live
'cause you make me want to die
You took it all, now you're all I've got
These noises in my head
Just noises in my head
If I could I'd drown them right out
And bury all of these noises from your tyrant mouth
You're just a noise in my head
I'll drown you out and I'll bury all the
Noises from your hateful little mouth<start>The walls are filled in here with glass
My eyes are stolen with a glance
And the cheap persuasion that has emptied
It's perfume and left us weary
Has been overlooked as art
I'm handed cups of tepid gleam
From smiles colorless and careful
My face is frozen as the winner takes his prize
And all eyes turn to stare
The lonelier the better
And all my friends are there
The click clicking of the floss
A dabble here and there
Why I'm here and why they're there?
I don't know why
The shaker's breaking up the peace
But I heard him stare, I heard him stare
The lonelier the better
And all my friends are there, are they all there?<start>Greyhound bus on a corner of a rainy street seems to say
Climb aboard by morning you will sleep far away
From this town where falling down brings laughing crowds
And not one hand to help you to your feet
Get on board (I'll take you away) get on board (I'll take you away)
Don't wait till it's too late get on board (I'll take you away)
Reflections of raindrops in the headlight beams seem to say
Go from this neon jungle for the price of your dreams is too much to pay
Leave this place this ride race this madning pace
It's just one great big chase for phoney face
Get on board (I'll take you away)...
Get on board (I'll take you away) get on board (I'll take you away)
Get on board (I'll take you away) get on board (I'll take you away)<start>Feel like a riddle today.
Glamor is in and I must say that you are barely okay.
Meanwhile I fight for reason.
Glamor in hand to defend, this my only body stance.
Take a look around,
Everything in turn will come down.
Don't depend on these broken promises,
They won't hear a sound.
Last chance to find the way out.
We only drive till sun down, these are the stick in the mud
I solved a riddle today.
Glamor is in and I must say that none of us are okay.
Take a look around,
Everything in turn will come down.
Don't depend on these broken promises,
They won't hear a sound.
We plant the seed
To grow the tree,
But save the fruit for the family.
Evolution turns another bloody hand,
Certainly that cannot stand.
Match sticks start the fire, but we point the blame,
And through the trees I scream your name.
Take a look around,
Everything in turn will come down.
Don't depend on these broken promises,
They won't hear a sound.
They won't hear a sound...<start>I want to steam you open
Want to swim your ocean
We would fly
I want to suck your motions
Exercise devotion
Never die
I'm growing you inside the star's eye
You fascinate the loops with open belt
If dreams were we, I'd be the sea
And you're some crazy fishing man
You're line's on fire
You're caught in my tide
Your sky's expiring
You're rolling again
I want to let you see it
Want to truly free it
You and I
I want to bleed your cedar 'til it gives me fever
And I'm high
And knowing you, you'll ride the far side
You liberate the moon from it's own shelf
If dreams were we, I'd take the lead
You're down on your knees
The wave is rising
A blink is all you need
Now you're inside me
Rolling again<start>Just what you need to make you feel better
Just what you need to make you feel
Just what you need to make you feel better
Just what you need to make you feel
At the far end of your tether
And your thoughts won't fit together
So you sleep light or whatever
And the night goes on forever
The your mind change like the weather
Your in need of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether
Even clouds seem bright and breezy
'Cause the livin' is free and easy
See the rat race in a new way
Like you're walkin' up to a new day
It's a wise thing if you're clever
Take a lead from Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether
Find the end of the rainbow
Fly wherever the winds blow
Laugh at life like a sideshow
Just what you need to make you feel better
Satisfaction altogether
Guaranteed by Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether
Find the end of the rainbow
Fly wherever the winds blow
Laugh at life like a sideshow
Just what you need to make you feel better
Don't stop bringin' the girls round
Don't start havin' a showdown
Keep on handin' the jug round
All that you need is wine and good company<start>I used to think that we could drink from the bottle of pure and simple life
Now I know that we can't go two or three days without a pointless fight[I truly think that we should reposition
The cold reality of what we're thinkin'
Stop, look and listen
Maybe that's the way that we'll know]In just a blink, we could shrink to something that might not make it back
In the end, I hope we mend, maybe we can finally make it right[Chorus]
Maybe this time we can heal our woundsCause if we don't, we'll just make some more
We've got a long way to go, It just takes a moment to kiss goodbyeIt just takes a moment to kiss goodbye
{Stop, look and listenMaybe that's the way that we'll know} - {Repeat - Fade}<start>I saw you walking down our street
Well you looked quite neat
Baggy jeans and long blond hair
Without a care in the world
What happened to the attitude you used to have at school
What happened to the attitude when you broke all the rules
I saw you just the other week
But we did not speak
You turned your back and flicked your hair
As if you did not care
Well I don't care where you come from
I don't give a damn
Well I don't care where you come from
It's all a sham
You're so special
You're so special

Get on, get on, get on, get on 'the groovy train'

For so long
I've been hoping
Your love's not gone
Houses are sliding in the mud
Rivers are raging in your blood
Where would I be
Without your love?
Where would I be
Without your arms around me?
You were to be
The only one
If I knew you
I would not run
You have been
Cloudy distant and dark
I'm thinking of
Noah and the ark
Where would I be
Without your love?
Where would I be
Without your arms around me?<start>I'm Running Around In A Loop,
Don't Know Why You Are So Hard To Find.
This Is A Crowded Place To Be,
Maybe That's Why I'm Confused.
I Didn't Know It Was So Hard To Find You.
Left, Right, Up And Down, I
Have Searched Every Floor.
Where, Tell Me Where Are You Now.
Don't You Want Me To Find You, Why?
I Know You're Counting On Me,
But I Don't Know Where To Start.
Every Time I'm Asking For Directions
There're Pointing At Different Ways.
I'm Confused, So What Shall I Do?
Little Red Beauty, You're Driving Me Crazy.
I've Been Here For Hours, I'm So Very Tired.
Suddenly I Saw A Sign To Show Me The Way.
You Know I Promise To Bring You What You Want.
Bringing You All Of My Loving.
Sir, How Are You Doing Today?
Looks Like Yo Need Some Help To Find
What Ever You Are Looking For,
That Is So Important To You.
Close Your Eyes,
Take A Breath Then Try Again.
You Know That You Can't Show Up
With Your Hands All Empty, Oh No.
[Chorus]
I Finally Saw You,
You Put A Smile On My Face.
Yes You Were Standing,
Beside The Others, Your Friends.
How Could I Be So Blind,
So Blind That I Didn't See You There?
Standing Right Beside The Others, Your Friends.
Show Me The Way,
You Know I Promise To Bring You What You Want.
Bringing You All My Loving,
Bringing You All My Love To You.<start>If you want to hear a love song
I could sing one
If you want to feel the fire
We could build one
If you need to catch a rainbow
We could chase one
If you want to be together
We could be one
Now, you talk about tomorrows
I can see one
There's no mountain we can't climb
If we reach one
If you believe in forever's
We could start one
If you want to be together
We could be one
One and one, I've always heard
Adds up to two
But one and one is only one
When that one is me and you
If you believe in forever's
We could start one
If you want to be together
We could be one<start>Nandito nakaukit pa rin sa puso ko,
Nang sabihin mong wag na lang.
Nandito nakatatak pa rin sa isip ko,
Kung paano mong tinalikuran ang lahat.
Kay bilis ba't umalis, nakakamiss
Na bigla lang di ko man lamang nalaman
Na mawawala,
Na bigla lang di mo man lamang naisip
Na idahan-dahan.
Hindi ako sanay sa biglaan,
Unti unti na lang sanang nawala.
Hindi ba natin kayang magkunwari,
at sabihing sige na lang
Hindi ba natin kayang dayain,
Ang mga yakap sa tuwing lumalamig
Kay bilis ba't umalis, nakakamiss
Na bigla lang di ko man lamang nalaman
Na mawawala,
Na bigla lang di mo man lamang naisip
Na idahan-dahan.
Hindi ako sanay sa biglaan,
Unti unti na lang sanang nawala.<start>you better run, you better hide

better run for shelter / and those dreams
everything is helter skelter / i would keep
better run for shelter / i would keep them from being free
better run for shelter baby

melt, youre starting lined up straight to the bitches
poke a face, smelt with the chronic up in my clitches
addicted, bullets are, bullets just barely missing you by inches
catching a box hold, clap and we lock load
grabbing the rock road, tracks and the spots blown
and cringe and the opposition is bridging
better run for shelter

something real that i can feel
got my arms
something real that i can feel

dont know it but were already dead
what was meant to be heard never was said
since the beginning of time been misled
times and times, eyes among the signs
universal truths defied, human rights denied
signs started black for mankind to live and serve on the front line

now all it takes is the push of a button
ten thousand miles away
better run for shelter
everything is helter skelter
better run for shelter
better run for shelter baby
better run for shelter / and those dreams

You picked them up and stepped right in

No more letters, just a will
All the prophets on the mountaintop
But no one's hanging on the hill
From now on, from now on
From now on I'm gonna be your friend
Something put you in my way

Fall in to the what is
Let your body do all the rest

Jazzers paid by J. Paul Getty II

Jazz police I think I'm falling,

Am I in trouble with the Jazz police?
Jazz police are looking through my folders
They will never understand our culture
They'll never understand the Jazz police

Blood is thicker margarine than grease
Let me be somebody I admire
Let me be that muscle down the street
Stick another turtle on the fire
Guys like me are mad for turtle meat

Eighteen, I gotta get away
I've gotta get out of this place
I'll go running into outer space

Took eighteen years to get this far
Don't always know what I'm talking about
Feels like I'm in the middle of doubt
'Cause I'm

The process of error
To lose access, to control
The greater of all thought without
Fear or emotion
To program to think to learn
Technology abyss
Mass productions of the errorless
Minds
Soon a helpless maker
Robotic genetics
Limitations in reality
Artificial intelligence
Assemble, construct the thought
Pattern
Deadly repercussions of science
No thoughts of self
Breaking down the mind
Under one control, forging
Obedience like a dog
Complete domination
Electricity the life's blood
Walking thin lines
To deaden is to live
Efficiency without feeling
Now your soul is lost
Wielding immense power
Without fear or emotion
In man's struggle
The rights of life
Uniform command
Erosion in all unity
Imprisoned by intelligence
Imprisoned by progress
Industrial empire
The greater of all thought
Production of a mind
The power of creation
Now a silent God

Trapped in the abyss
Technological cell
Electronic living hell

And if not me
Find someone who knows who you are

She once knew me
We had our own world
My life was free
I loved someone
I set them free
They haven't yet come back to me
But if they do
I'll surely be
More lucky than anyone could be
An empty house
A sacrificial mouse
A head full of lead
Weighing all the things that she said
But I digress
My tunnel vision
Make me pay
I know what i'm missing

She once knew me
We had our own world
My life was free
I loved someone
I set them free
They haven't yet come back to me
But if they do
I'll surely be
More lucky than anyone could be
So won't you please
Find your way back to me
My one and only
Find your way back to me
I once knew a girl
She once knew me
We had our own world
I like what's free
I loved someone
I set them free
They haven't yet come back to me
But if they do
I'll surely be
More lucky than anyone could be
And if not me
Find someone who loves you<start>Nothing ventured nothing gained
Tired and washed out by the pain
Do we share this problem, will it slip away ?
Or do we fight another day ?
Was I looking for a friend ?
One I count on 'till the end
Is there something that I didn't do ?
Does it all begin with you ?
[CHORUS]
So how did I, Oh I
Give you reason ?
But how did I, Oh I
Give you reason ?
After all the fallen tears
When we wake the taken dream
Who let the water slowly draw away ?
All the colours that we made
[CHORUS]
To give you reason, to change the river's flow
To give you reason, to point the bone
To give you reason, go set your spirit free
I don't know, I don't know why
Is there nothing I can say ?
Is there nothing I can do, girl ?
Didn't mean to break your life
Didn't mean to burn your world, no

You can keep the silver band
You can have the memories, girl
Now as 'Pilate' cleans the hands
It's no more to do with me, no

So how did I, Oh I
Give you reason ?

I can feel your love
Shooting holes in my stupid pride
When you love
I don't fear your love
Of all the angels you're the most divine
Holy love
You can really have anything you want from me
Anything you ask me to, I'll do
We can live in poverty or prosperity
Anything impossible, I'll try
You can really have everything you ask
And I'll be intimate with you
Giving everything over
To making everything right
Holy love
When you love
I can feel your love
Shooting holes in my stupid pride
When you love
I don't fear your love
Of all the angels you're the most divine
Holy love
You can really make anyone you want of me
Anyone you need tonight, I'll be
Whether you want empathy, animosity
An enemy or company, call me
I can even be nothing if you ask
I'll turn invisible for you
I'm the bird on your shoulder
Singing psalms through the night
Of holy love<start>You said you needed love to warm you in the night,
So you gave yourself to strangers,
Who left you crying at first light.
You think the world you live in doesn't notice you
But, don't you worry, baby,
I'll be there to comfort you.
So take it easy, easy,
Easy does it, baby, nice and slow,
I'll take you anywhere the four winds blow.
So weep no more, my lady, don't you cry,
I can't paint your portrait with those tears in your eye.
But, I can give you love, every night and day
An' we will walk together,
The sun and moon will light our way.
So take it easy, easy,
Easy does it, baby, nice and slow,
I'll take you anywhere the four winds blow.
I'll tell you something you'll understand,
Grab a hold now, baby,
And I'll lead you to the promised land.
I'll make you feel so good, make you feel alright
Chase away the shadows and keep you warm at night,
Ooh, I'll keep you warm.
Take it easy, easy,
Easy does it, baby, nice and slow,
I'll take you anywhere the four winds blow.
Gonna keep you smiling and satisfied,
Nothing but blue skies on a magic carpet ride.
Take it easy, easy,
Easy does it, baby, nice and slow,
I'll take you anywhere the four winds blow.
Anywhere the four winds blow, I'll take you there.
Here we go, baby, hold on.
No more worry, no more pain,
The sun is always shining,
And it never, ever rains,
And it never, ever rains,
And it never, ever rains.<start>You're right you opened my eyes to
a beautiful world
So close I came to the dark side
to be rescued by you
It's dawn now, the suns coming home
to heat my bones and clear my head
I'm littered, scattered and jitters
I'm the best I've ever been
It's overrated, all we do
It's overrated, all we do
I owe you
I love you
and I trust you, that you'll love me too
your rescue, my refuge
your rescue, my refuge<start>So up rolls a riot van
And sparks excitement in the boys
But the policemen look annoyed
Perhaps these are ones they should avoid
Got chased last night
From men with truncheons dressed in hats
We didn't do that much wrong
Still ran away though for the laugh
Just for the laugh
And please just stop talking cause they won't find us if you do
Oh those silly boys in blue
Well they won't catch me and you
Have you been drinking son, you don't look old enough to me
I'm sorry officer, is there a certain age you're supposed to be, cause nobody told me
And up rolls the riot van
And these lads just wind the coppers up
They ask why they don't catch proper crooks
They get their address and their names took
But they couldn't care less<start>They were driving south on the highway
Their business was in another town
Bigger than the town they were driving from.
Business took place during office hours in both towns.
This drive was considered business
The feeling of passing other cars was also considered business
A feeling of business being done.
The feeling of drifting slowly through a field of moving vehicles.
This was the REAL speed - the speed of business.
Not the numbers on the speedometer.
One of them was playing with the radio
Slowly changing the channel from one station to another
Sometimes listening to both channels at once.
On one channel a man was talking to another man on the telephone.
The other channel was playing oldies
"Gone for Good"
"Listening Wind"
"Puzzle Power"
"Beechwood Serenade"
"Sunshine and Sugar"
"Golden Windows"
"Taste of Believing"
"Carnival Girl"
"Love Walks Away"
"Wishing Well"
"Knew You Could"
"A Face Like That"
"Dark Highway"
"Shakin Venus"
"Colored Wheels"
"Visit Me Quick"
"Lonesome Money"
"School of Heartache"
"Painted Smiles"
The sound of business being done.<start>Well I was never good at picking what to wear, for somebody else
This dress will go good with her hair
At least I think in this light
From the lamp beside this couch
With half the bulbs burnt out
I'm starting to know how that feels
Autumn leaves
Come back to you
Autumn leaves
You feelin blue
But when autumn leaves
Her love for me won't
Well the cancer got her good this time around
18 hours left before they put her in the ground
Was this the hand of god
That they talk about in church
If it is then it won't hurt
Only believers will know
Autumn leaves
Come back to you
Autumn leaves
You feelin blue
But when autumn leaves
Her love for me won't
There's a cold front that's headed for the town
This one will be rough
Some killers never make a sound....
They just walk up, take a knife to you and yours
Leave a message on my door
When I return to normal you'll know
Autumn leaves
Come back to you
Autumn leaves
You feelin blue
Autumn leaves
What can I do
When autumn leaves
Her love for me won't<start>Good morning little schoolgirl

Come a little closer my pretentious whore I'm living with a feeling that I can't ignore
Come a little closer my pretentious whore I'm living with a feeling that I can't ignore
Come a little closer my pretentious whore I'm living with a feeling that i can't ignore

Same book just another chapter
I never though it could be worse then last year
But here I am again today
I laugh 'cause it hurts when i scream
But I'll make it through 'cause I believe
Chorus:
That even when my heart breaks
And everything's shaken
I'm left alone in the rain
You won't, you won't, won't
You won't let me go
When life's insane
And everything's crazy
You carry me through the pain
And you won't, you won't, won't
You won't let me go
Here we go it's a three-ring circus
Juggling it all, trying to find my purpose
With each new day, I'm praying just to make it through
When my next disaster is near
I know that you'll meet me right here
Chorus:
That even when my heart breaks
And everything's shaken
I'm left alone in the rain
You won't, you won't, won't
You won't let me go
When life's insane
And everything's crazy
You carry me through the pain
And you won't, you won't, won't
You won't let me go
I feel your love that surrounds me
My world can shake but it won't drown me
'Cause I'm trusting you
No matter what I'm going through
Chorus:
That even when my heart breaks
And everything's shaken
I'm left alone in the rain
You won't, you won't, won't
You won't let me go
When life's insane
And everything's crazy
You carry me through the pain
And you won't, you won't, won't
You won't let me go<start>Right now
Well it's finally time to face my fears
Gonna get the hell out of here
And create a fresher atmosphere
But the consequences clear
There's a furnace set on high
And the yearning undefyed
But it's time to turn the tide
It's social suicide
Like you
Perseverance is a useless tool
Just a patron on a ship of fools
Painting interest in the cast and crew
Why you've broken every single rule
There's a furnace set on high
And the yearning undefyed
But it's time to turn the tide
It's social suicide
Shadows entertain me
I don't want it masses
Shadows explain their known reactions
I don't even know if I can ever find truth
But I'm sure it won't come from far away
There's a furnace set on high
And the yearning undefied
But it's time to turn the tide
It's social suicide<start>If in your sickness you are desperate to recover
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute now
When you're a seeker who is longing to discover
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute now 'cause
[Chorus]
They who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength
They will mount up on wings, they will walk and not faint
Seasons of this life change but God's faithfulness remains
They who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength
When you keep asking but the answer still eludes you
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute now
When the anger burns and threatens to consume you
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute now 'cause
[Chorus]
So wait, wait, just wait, wait
When you've been running
Love comes sneaking up behind you
Hey, wait a minute now
[Chorus]
Shall renew their strength, so hurry up and wait<start>Verse:
I fell asleep to the television
I woke up with a new religion
I'm designed to fall
I'm frightened by my new condition
Apathy's my new tradition
I despise the fall
Pre Chorus:
And now I feel like this is just a moment where I can't admit I'm lost in it
And I hold tight to any kind of memory that won't commit I'm losing grip
Chorus:
My slate's been cleaned by someone else
Now I'm a stranger to myself
The whisper in my sleep is
The ghost in the machine, yeah
Verse:
I'm following the fleeting masses
Frolicking among the ashes
I'm designed to fall
I've never felt so sentimental
Nostalgia's proving detrimental
I despise the fall
Pre Chorus:
And now I feel like this is just a moment where I can't admit I'm lost in it
And I hold tight to any kind of memory that won't commit I'm losing grip
Chorus:
My slate's been cleaned by someone else
Now I'm a stranger to myself
The whisper in my sleep is
The ghost in the machine, yeah
I've run my circles proud and well
The ghost is lost inside its cell
The flicker in my sleep is
The ghost in the machinery
Bridge (Guitar Solo)
Chorus:
My slate's been cleaned by someone else
Now I'm a stranger to myself
The whisper in my sleep is
The ghost in the machine, yeah
I've run my circles proud and well
The ghost is lost inside its cell
The flicker in my sleep is
The ghost in the machinery<start>Are your garments all spotless?
Are they white as the snow?
Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?
Is your soul all spotless?
Is it clean as the snow?
Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?
I am washed, yes I'm washed
I am washed in the blood
I'm all washed in the blood of the lamb
I'm all clean I'm all spotless
I'm all pure like the snow
I'm all washed in the blood of the lamb
Have you laid down your burdens?
Have you found peace and rest?
Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?
I've laid down all my troubles
I've found peace and rest
I'm all washed in the blood of the lamb
Have you learned to love your neighbors?
Of all colors, creeds and kinds?
Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?
I've learned to love my peoples
Of all colors, creeds, and kinds
I'm all washed in the blood of the lamb
I am washed, yes I'm washed
I am washed in the blood
I'm all washed in the blood of the lamb
I'm all clean I'm all spotless
And I'm pure like the snow
I'm all washed in the blood of the lamb<start>Though you say we're through
I'll always love you
And you can depend on me
Though someone that you've met
Has made you forget
Honey, you know
You can count on me
When I wish, I wish you success
And loads, loads of happiness
But baby, I gotta confess
I'll be lonely
If you ever, ah, if you ever need a friend
I'll be yours until the end
And you can depend on me
I wish you success
And loads of happiness
But, darling, I gotta confess
I'm gonna be lonely<start>Walking alone 'cause the night is dead
Crossed my mind when I crossed the bridge
How you lost your mind and your wrist got bruised
And you wanted better love when it's sleeping in your bedroom
Hold on, stay on my side, don't go
If you could see me whoever I am, it's not like a movie but it's not all skin and bones
So come on love(come on, come on, come all and go)
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go
Now I'm walking alone 'cause the night is dead
My feet don't glide like they did back then
When I would call you up so we could shoot the moon
These days I'm left to howl in toon
Hearts do break and I must admit, I've got a better set of chords so I might've been fakin??? it
Think I really cried just once so
If you could see me whoever I am, it's not like a movie but it's not all skin and bones
So come on love(come on, come on, come all and go)
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go
After all the shows, after the boys of summer will go
Amid all the confusion
These friends I've been losin???
I always thought from the start
I'd be the one moving on
I guess I'll never know
Where all the boys of summer will go
But I'll miss what we made
All those days were not wasted
There are some things I may never know
How you lost your mind and your wrist got bruised
And you wanted better love when it's sleeping in your bedroom
Hold on, stay on my side, don't go
If you could see me whoever I am, it's not like a movie but it's not all skin and bones
So come on love(come on, come on, come all and go)
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go
If you could see me whoever I am, it's not like a movie but it's not all skin and bones
So come on love(come on, come on, come all and go)
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go
(Walking alone 'cause the night is dead)
If you could see me whoever I am,
(Crossed my mind when I crossed the bridge)
It's not like a movie but it's not all skin and bones
(Walking alone 'cause the night is dead)
So come on love(come on, come on, come all and go)
(Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go)<start>Not so long ago I set out on this road
With my friends and my companions by my side
And I think of you wherever I do go
I'm a rambler, I ain't hard to satisfy
[Chorus:]
Won't be long till I am home again with you
Just a few more miles to go
Won't be long till I can get back on my own
Won't be long till I can spend my time with you
In the airport I'm standing in a line
Search my pockets, check me out and I'm alright
It's not hard but it ain't easy all the time
To be in some other town most every night
[Chorus:]<start>what have we done
what have we done
another fate
another mind
another face in time
if you want to reach those sonic heights
you've got to pay your cosmic dues
the game may change but the name remains
Brainticket blues
Brainticket blues
black dwarf
white hole
rings of Saturn
human soul
as meteorite burns to earthly pebble
a little space rock in your shoe
the journey's long but the song goes on
Brainticket blues
Brainticket blues
what have we done
what have we done
alien forms
infinite ocean
the rhythm of stars
celestial motion
moondust
sound eye
Ra and Horus
sun and sky
I've got strangers in my antechamber
vibrations cast in synthesized hues
we've traveled far to be where we are
Brainticket blues
Brainticket blues
quarks, neurons
connective branches
the river of being
ephemeral trances
what have we done
what have we done
and can it be undone
east west
cultures collide
societies committing suicide
there are reactions in fractions
great vestibules in molecules
may mystery's fire sustain our desire
Brainticket blues
Brainticket blues<start>I don't know what it is but
It makes me feel I'm crazy
I don't know what it is but
It makes reality hazy
I don't know what it is but
I got the feeling that it might be love
I don't know what it is but
It's a feelin' that moves me
I don't know what it is but
It sends a shiver running through me
I don't know what it is but
I got the feeling that it might be love
It might be love
I don't know what it is but
It makes my heart beat faster
I don't know what it is but
It has become my master
I don't know what it is but
It has a taken control
I don't know what it is but
It's taken my very heart and soul
I don't know what it is but
It's this feelin' that moves me
I don't know what it is but
It sends these shivers running through me
I don't know what it is but
I got the feeling that it might be love
I don't know what it is but
I got the feeling that it might be love
I don't know what it is but
I got the feeling that it might be love
I don't know what it is but
I got the feeling that it might be love<start>I see your mama, and the candles and tears and roses
I see your daddy walk his daughter down the isle
I feel my knees start to tremble as I tell the preacher
Don't she look beautiful tonight
All the wonderful words in my head I've been thinking
You know I want to say 'em all just right
I lift your veil, and angels start singing
Such a heavenly sight, yeah
Lost in this moment with you
I am completely consumed
My feelings so absolute, there's no doubt
Sealing our love with a kiss
Waitin' my whole life for this
Watching all my dreams come true
Lost in this moment with you, yeah
I smell the jasmine floating in the air like a love song
Watch my words draw sweet tears from your eyes
Bow our heads while the preacher talks to Jesus
Please bless this brand new life, yeah
Lost in this moment with you
I am completely consumed
My feelings so absolute, there's no doubt
Sealing our love with a kiss
Waitin' my whole life for this
Watching all my dreams come true
Lost in this moment with you, yeah
Lost in this moment with you
I am completely consumed
My feelings so absolute, there's no doubt
Sealing our love with a kiss
Waitin' my whole life for this
Watching all my dreams come true
Lost in this moment with you
Lost in the moment, (in the moment) in this moment with you
Lost in the moment, yeah
Lost in the moment, (in the moment) in this moment with you
Lost in the moment<start>Screaming for a love-bite
And you hide it, that it makes you feel alright
See your secret in a mirror
It's black 'n' blue and it happened to you
In the heat of the night
It hurts just the first time
Ooh, it hurts
It hurts just the very first time
Screaming for a love-bite
For a love-bite
Hiding that it feels right
Screaming for a love-bite
Grinding makes so uptight
And you gotta face it, 'cause it decorates your neck
It's gonna stay there
Stay there for a long time
Just to remind you while you like it
When you went on and on
It hurts just the first time
Ooh, it hurts
It hurts just the very first time
Screaming for a love-bite
For a love-bite
Hiding that it feels right
Screaming for a love-bite [Repeat: x1]<start>You better open your eyes wide, it's all here
You been too long on the inside
Time to try some fine tuning, focus in if you can
You better open your eyes now
Better seen as they say, there's just no way
I'm falling for all of that
Just leave your things at the door and nothing more
But take what you can
The sun better open your eyes wide 'cause it's all clear
You been too long on the inside
Time to try some fine tuning, focus in if you can
You better open your eyes now
Better seen as they say, there's just no way
I'm falling for all of that
Just leave your things at the door and nothing more
But take what you can
There's one small problem I see, I disagree
Falling for all of that
Just leave your brain at the door and nothing more
But take what you can
Better seen as they say, there's just no way
I'm falling for all of that
There's just one problem I see, I disagree
Better before you're fine [unverified]<start>After I leave for worlds unknown
Over the border line
Never again on earth to know
What will I leave behind?
Leave behind, oh, leave behind
What will I leave behind?
After I leave for worlds unknown
What will I leave behind?
Will I be missed by those I love
Or have I been unkind?
And have I been true to God above
What will I leave behind?
Leave behind, oh, leave behind
What will I leave behind?
After I leave for worlds unknown
What will I leave behind?<start>Probably get it wrong much as I get it right
But I got it right woman when I caught your eye
I remember most about that night
Is I love the way you move baby
Yes I love the way you move baby
I like most liquor, but I don't like gin
Dont always like the skin I'm in
But when I get it wrong gotta start again
But I love the way you love me, baby
And I love the way you move
I love the way you move
(Chorus)
All the freaks are on parade
I wanna fill my belly, so I gotta get paid
Doesn't everybody deserve to have the good life?
But it don't always work out
Cry cry baby, if we must
Just remember, Oh remember
I love the way you love me, baby
And I love the way you move
I'm not all bad, but I'm a faithful sinner
I might get lost, but I'll be home for dinner
If God don't like me, he can send me to hell
But I love the way you love me, girl
I love the way you move
I pray to heaven to keep my place
But I looked in the mirror, saw the devil's face
And Id be a dog for a tail to chase
But I love the way you kiss me baby
I love the way you talk, baby
you move, I love the way you move but
(Chorus)
All the freaks are on parade
I wanna fill my belly, so I gotta get paid
Doesn't everybody deserve to have the good life?
But it don't always work out
Cry cry baby, if we must
But Just remember, just remember
I love the way you move me
Oh yea I love the way you love me, baby

Bad days come when the good day's gone
Working as hard as the day is long
And a working man works
when I get home
I love the way you talk baby
I love the way you talk baby

All the freaks are on parade
I wanna fill my belly, so I gotta get paid
Doesn't everybody deserve to have a good life?
But it don't always work out
Cry cry baby, if we must
But, Oh remember, Oh remember
All the people are on parade
thought I saw a spaceman tryna get laid
Doesn't everybody deserve to have the good life?
And it don't always work out
Cry cry baby, if we must
Oh remember, Just remember
I love the way you love me baby.
I love the way you move.<start>Your life, mislaid
Spoon-fed, well raised
[Chorus]
Hey you you're nodding out
What's this all about
Hey you you're nodding out
What's this all about
Hey you! hey you! hey you!
Hey you what's this now
Going down going down
Are you sorry now
Going down going down
What's your story now
Going down, why do you want to die
Black tar in your veins
Once new, now stained
[Chorus]<start>Hey bro, take it slow
You ain't livin' in a video
You're flying low with a high velocity
No doubt, you're stressin' out
That ain't what rock n' roll's about
Get off that one way trip down lonely street
Now I know you've been kicked around
You ain't alone in this ugly town
You stick a needle in your arm
You bite the dust, you buy the farm
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
What ya tryin' to do
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
They win you lose
Hey, hye, hey, hey, hey stoopid
C'mon girl, it's a better day
Get your foot out of that grave
Don't let that one love tear your world apart
C'mon babe, kick that stuff
Show the street it ain't so tough
Quit lyin' around with a crippled, broken heart
Now I know you've been seeing red
Don't put a pistol to your head
sometimes your answer's heaven sent
Your way is so damn permanent
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
What ya tryin' to do
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
They win you lose
Hey, hye, hey, hey, hey stoopid
This ain't your daddy talkin'
You know, I know
Your story ain't so shocking
You know, I know

And pull me down, again
Well now come on easy rider
Turn this screaming fire
Down low

Pull this pain
And let it go
This time around
Don't think that I can take it
This twisting pain

Easy rider
Help me
Easy rider<start>Qu triste se nos fue la vida
Atras del cielo nos miran llorar
Fumando lunas a escondidas
Revoloteando entre viejas paredes
Qu triste se nos fue la vida
La lluvia acida mojaba octubre
Y de rodillas vuelan lamentos
De algunos buitres de algunos cerdos
Avientame
Avientame hasta donde quieras
Y luego ven a mirar como revivo
Avientame
Avientame hasta donde quieras
Y luego ven a mirar como no muero
Como aguanto
Qu tristes senos tiene carmela
El silicon le ha roto el corazn
Y ahora llora como ernesto
Que se ha castrado por falta de amor
Avientame
Avientame hasta donde quieras
Y luego ven a mirar como revivo
Avientame
Avientame hasta donde quieras
Y luego ven a mirar como no muero
Como aguanto<start>Listen mister, brother, sister
Family and friend
I fear with each day pass
Our time grows closer to the end
Listen stranger, passerby
And those I never knew
And not one day that you are living
Has been promised to you
And I am a God fearing man
I'm a God, I'm a God fearing man
And I reach out, I reach out for my God's hand
I'm a God fearing man
Listen mother, sister, brother
Relatives and kin
You want to know just where you're going
You've got to know where you've been
And tell me what gives one the right
To say their God is better than anybody else
Don't we all have a right
To find God for ourself
And I am a, God, God fearing man
I'm a God, hey, hey, hey, hey God fearing man
And I reach out for my, for my God's hands
I'm a God fearing, fearing man
Yes I am
So when I rise with the morning sun
I give thanks to my God for the gift of another one
Oh and when my day is over and complete
I reach to my God to put me back on my feet
And I am a God fearing man
I'm a, I, I, I'm a hey, hey God
And I reach out for my God's hand
I'm a God fearing man
Yes I am<start>Gut the animals, they won't feel a thing.
You're all pigs in shit
You should just call your mothers out, they'd be so proud of you,
As you celebrate human suffering.
You make it obvious.
Should we hang them high up under the gallows?
Are we ever going to learn, are you ever going to value this life?
We are privileged, we are all obliged
Just go fuck yourself
I am your sword of Damocles
Get down on your knees, will you have mercy on us please.?
How did we all fall down?
You make it obvious
Should we hang them high up under the gallows?
Are we ever going to learn, are you ever going to value this life?<start>[Instrumental]<start>Lost in a world created by Man
I can't recall how it all began
Tell me who am I?
Fictional stars in lost Galaxies
Synthetic dreams and false Memories
Is it all a lie?
There is no escape
There is no way out of here
I'm locked in this universe
The real world will disappear
Where fantasy dies
You will see our dreams
Material lies
Materialize
Computer eyes
Computerize
Virtual reality - computer Override
Actual fantasy locked away Inside
Am I no more than a Program
An artificial dream
A river of electrons flowing With the stream
A parallel dimension battle Simulations
Mind over matter brain Stimulation
I don't know if I exist I think Therefore I am
Without emotions I'm but a Hologram
There's no escape I'm locked In this universe
Where fantasy dies material Lies
Computer eyes<start>It's a hard world to get a break in
All the good things have been taken
But girl there are ways to make certain things pay
Though I'm dressed in these rags, I'll wear sable some day
Hear what I say
I'm gonna ride the serpent
No more time spent sweatin' rent
Hear my command
I'm breakin' loose, it ain't no use
Holdin' me down, stick around
But baby (baby)
Remember (remember)
It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my mind and I'll think what I want
Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime
But some day I'll treat you real fine
There'll be women and their fortunes
Who just want to mother orphans
Are you gonna cry, when I'm squeezin' the rye
Takin' all I can get, no regrets
When I, openly lie
And leave only money
Believe me honey, that money
Can you believe, I ain't no saint
No complaints
So girl go out
Hand it out
And baby (baby)
Remember (remember)
It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my mind and I'll think what I want
Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime
But some day I'll treat you real fine

I'll stand beside you baby if you break down
Ain't no mountain that I won't climb, yeah
Hey little girl, come on let's
Knock on love, come into my little world
'Cause if I touch you there, I'll touch you here
And all your troubles will disappear, little girl
Come on let's, knock on love, all night long

I would swim across the stormy seas
I'd rode down any river just to get to you
I'd do anything that you please

I ask myself if I let you down

I can't believe that you're in my arms

Shall we let the rain fall over us
Shall we sing a settlement song
Should have been who I was all along (all along)
Let your mind keep you strong
It's too late you're long gone
It's too late we're undone
I find you all by yourself on the street again
Baby come home again
Baby come home again
It's dangerous cause the people are struggling
It's dangerous cause you're hard to see
I want to make everything better
I want to make you believe
I lost myself to the sea of memories
I lost myself to irreverent dreams
I lost myself when I first met you
I lost myself more than I ever knew

It's too late we're undone
I find you all by yourself on the street again

I suck the same lines as anyone
I do the same time as anyone

And weekends away in the city
Far too far gone to well-say
It seems today's like any other day
You just call me up to tell me
You're gone when I already know
You couldn't stand it any longer
A Mexican engineer
Who told me I should do some running
Before it gets too goddamn late
Now stealing cars in Guanajuato
The drag queen comes to the window
She says I'd been told you had already gone
Why don't you stay a little longer?
Shutting
Shutting
Shutting down
Closing up for awhile
Shutting
Shutting
Shutting down
Forget me now
Human shit and cigarettes
And weekends away in the city
Far too far gone to well-say
It seems today's like any other day<start>Tides of glass, return to ash.
In the dawn, we follow the path away from the sun.
Shadows cast in wake of the past.
Reaching out, into the dark and out of the light.
Crawling underneath our feet,
A river running black and green
From the heart of the gallows tree,
Where the future and our fate
Will bleed into the world below.
Stone to bear the mountain stairs.
In the night, we dance with our devils and dine with the snakes.
The dead will stare in joy and despair
Rising up, away from the earth, into the clouds.
From the eye of the Graeae we stole,
A truth that we can't unknow.
Spinning on the threads they sew
In a river of the tears that flow into the world below.
Over, under, threads of fate.
Weaving patterns, soon and late.
As in this life, so in all things
The end result, the action brings.
The fates will divide in three.
A sight that we can't unsee.
We're falling to our hands and knees
As the past and the future bleed into the world below.<start>Digging deeper in my mind, can't get you out of my head
There's no way to describe, just how you make me feel
I don't know is it love, I have lost control
Even when I'm gone, I can't get away
I can't focus, when I'm near you
Do you notice, me at all?
I can't focus, when I hear you
Do you notice, that I can't focus?
Like the moth flies to the light, catch it at first sight
I can't deny, I'm taken by the beauty in your eye's
I don't know is it love, I have lost control
Even when I'm gone, I can't get away
I can't focus, when I'm near you
Do you notice, me at all?
I can't focus, when I hear you
Do you notice, that I can't focus?

Do you notice, that I can't focus?<start>I've been hearing voices
Voices in my head
Can't escape the noises
Lying in my bed
The winter nights grow colder
The darkness falls too soon
I will hide till morning
How silent is this moon?
Just one look and I will find
Someone else on the other side
A trick of light or the darker mind
Ghost in the mirror
And as the dawn is waking
The shadows burn away
The sun reborn the savior
The safety of the day
Just one look and I will find
Someone else on the other side
A trick of light or the darker mind
Ghost in the mirror
The darkness calls me
The shadows fool me
Is it safe on the other side?
Is this my future?
If it's a dream why can't I wake?
Just one look and I will find
Someone else on the other side
A trick of light or the darker mind
Ghost in the mirror<start>Als ich gefallen bin, reichtest du mir deine Hand.
Schenktest mir mein LÃ¤cheln wieder, selbst wenn ich in TrÃ¤nen stand.
Wie ein Fels in der Brandung, du warst Fels und Sturm zugleich.
Wie eine BrÃ¼cke die die Welten verbindet, ein starker Wille der viel Ã¼berwindet
Wie der Baum der allem stand hÃ¤lt, wie der Freund der immer Wort hÃ¤lt
Wie ein Bruder, wie ein Bruder und du warst immer fÃ¼r mich da.

Als du dann Gegangen bist, ging auch ein groÃer Teil von mir.
Ein Engel fliegt niemals allein fort, ein Teil der Seele lÃ¤sst er hier.
Zwischen Asche aus Trauer und Schmerzen wÃ¤chst die Erinnerung.
Komm sag mir, sag mir warum denn jetzt schon?
Noch so Jung, und weshalb denn so frÃ¼h schon?
Immer die besten gehen zu erst fort.

Just making sure that you got my drift.
It's the one that dropped you off that cliff.
Wake up, this is yesterday screaming to you from god knows where.
I'm sorry I left so quick, but eating all that shit made me sick.
I hope you understand.
I'm torn between screaming and kissing you, so alone I forgot to miss you.
I shoulda told you the truth, well you know what they say.
Hindsight's always 20 knives to the brain.
Congratulations, heart.
You've committed the ultimate crime.
At least we know you're still working but I followed you the wrong way this time.
What's up with me not calling, telling you everything I feel?
Even the devil turned down that deal.
Don't you remember all those things we believed in?
I guess worse things have been done, just let me know when you think of one.
We oughta be ashamed.
Always thought of myself as an honest guy.
Turns out I'm only painfully, partially right.
Lesson learned posthumously, so it goes.
Hindsight's always 20 Tyson-type blows.
Congratulations, heart.
You've committed the ultimate crime.
At least we know you're still beating, but apparently you can't keep time.
How can we expect to live with the truth under our matresses,
suffocating the souls we were trying to save?<start>If you should fall
If you should fall
Far from grace
If you should call
I'll be here
Wakes up to music again (again)
You can feel sunlight in your eyes
Living, it's so useless 'round here
The city's so dangerous,
On your own
A beauty that's yours
If you should fail
If you should fall
From grace
A beauty, beauty fades
If you should fall
If you should fail
Far from grace
Far from grace
No, a beauty you can own<start>I don't know about using plastercine
To close my wounds or to hold the smile on my face
Meaningless hours turn into meaningless years
Meaningless promises to meaningless fears
Show me your answers, baby, show me the light
Show me the goal and I will get there on my own
Fallout, all inside your words
Fallout, deep inside of you
Fallout in my world is made of your lies
Fallout pouring down on me
How much more can the sewers hold inside
Reincarnated evil never meant to hide
Meaningless words turn to meaningless truth
Meaningless acts of love to meaningless you
Blood is the answer, baby, blood is the light
Deny me the door and I will find my own way out

Fallout, deep inside of you
Fallout in my world is made of your lies
Fallout pouring down on me
Fallout, all inside your words
Fallout, deep inside of you
Fallout in my world is made of your lies
Fallout pouring down on me<start>We find our faith in the damnedest place
The thin line between love and hate
Sold it all for a shot of hope
You can feel but you can't cope
Although you know that it hurts
They can't make it any worse
You can't break a broken soul
Warm heart that's turned cold
Here it comes again, that familiar feeling
Almost tastes like hate
In my own strage way
I like being left in the dark
Because I'm always there to watch it fall apart
On the long road finding means to an end
Here we fucking go again
Believing left me empty handed stuck with a heavy heart
Unraveled and fucking broken
I'm just trying to play it smart
Dazed in the past, forced to die alone
I'm headed downhill fast to parts unknown<start>from the heavens in the heights above all the angels
show your love sun and moon
and the shining stars the deepest waters and skies so far
we can love forever and never pass away
all the lightning the clouds and wind the moving mountains
and the trees that bend the wild creatures and the mighty birds
show your love all across the earth
we can love forever all through the nights and the days
we can love forever and never pass away<start>On and On
On and On
She broke my heart, he hurt me too
That's something that only unworthy souls do
They said goodbye, we say hello
An introduction for a perfect love to grow
Let's stop thinking about the past
And start thinking about the future
So that love can go on and on
Let's stop thinking about the past
And start thinking about the future
So that love can go on and on
She said she'd stay, he said that too
So sad when you find out your love has found a new
She made me cry, he made me weep
But life has love in store for us that's ooh so sweet
On and On (love keeps going on)
On and On (they've got the whole of life)
On and On (love keeps going on)
On and
It's time to say goodbye to crying eyes and broken dreams
And get back to the joy that to each other we will bring
That starts from summer love to last through autumn, winter, spring
Our hearts will sing forever, love<start>[Prodigy:]
Patterns are forming
Breaking through the noise
A beautiful symmetry
Slowly falling into place
Inspiration is flowing
Filling up the void
A perfect harmony
Full of elegance and grace
I've come alive
The road is so much clearer now
I'm finally awake
Destiny waits
[Father:]
Oh, am I getting through to you
Can you hear me, son?
I never doubted you
I always knew you'd win this fight
I am reaching out to you
Can you help me, son?
I'm so close to the answer
But I need your brilliant mind
We've come alive
Our goal is so much closer now
Now it's time to turn the page
Destiny waits
Now we will fulfill our fate
Destiny waits!<start>Ya comido, se iba descansar
mecido por las mosquiteras y por el ruido en la cocina,
por las ventanas entreabiertas, reflejos en la pared,
y alguna cosa abstracta se aduenaba de mi,
senta ablar bajito para no molestar,
y era como un mal de Africa, mal de Africa .
Con las sillas sentados en la calle,
pantaln corto y camiseta por el calor que haca.
En la ventana tras la reja mi padre si peinaba,
el olor de brillantina se apoderaba de mi.
El placer de sentirse juntos para criticar,
y era como un mal de Africa, mal de Africa.
En la ventana tras la reja mi padre si peinaba,
el olor de brillantina se apoderaba de mi.
El placer de sentirse juntos para criticar,
y era como un mal de Africa, mal de Africa.<start>Memories creep in circles
Beggin' for life
Beggin' for love
Your sweet gaze so tender
Loving and precious I just can't deny
It's not easy being the strong one
When I never was in control
Chorus
'Cause I stopped being right
And started to listen, to listen
When I look to your eyes
It makes me feel crazy
Yeah crazy inside, yeah inside
Starlight and the moongaze
Gives me a feelin' I can't resist
You stand quiet
The wise one
Making me beg for oh just one kiss
It's not easy being the tough one
When I'm buckin' at my knees
Repeat Chorus
Oh, tell me baby
It's not easy
But it's not hard
'Cause I know it's been so long
Since I told you the way I feel
Repeat Chorus
Oh crazy, yeah crazy inside
Oh crazy, yeah crazy inside<start>It's crawling with idiot
I'm itching to leave
I'm soft with fatigue I need something
I've never seen anything quite like you
In here
Come on it's not serious
I just need arms tonight
You're blue collar pride
And you're loose cotton cool
You're wilting a little
Nothing grows down here<start>I will stand my ground,
wont be pushed around,
I'll never give it up to you!
I will stake my claim,
Won't burn in the flames,
I'll never give it up to you!
Chorus: Say it loud now,
want no part of you!
And these foolish games,
that you play!
Now I won't fall down,
toe to toe, and pound for pound,
I'll never give it up to you!
God has planted a seed,
and I have made my creed,
I'll never give it up to you!
I will fight to the end,
you'll never hurt me again,
Cause I'll never give it up to you!
my Savior died for me,
that's when He set me free,
now I'll never give that up to you!<start>We were green as grass when I took your hand
And the whole world held it's breath
Cause you don't look down when you step out on faith
Now I take pride that we've stood by
These sacred words we said
Even though it hasn't all been sunny days
[Chorus]
We've been eye to eye with a full fledged hurricane
Seen the water high and felt the winds of change
But like a rock we stood strong
Side by side through it all
Now we don't fear those cloudy skies
'Cause baby you and I
Got a love come rain or come shine
I've placed the blame and you've cursed my name
And there were many times
Lightning cracked and thunder shook our door
I know our life ain't been some kind of perfect paradise
But baby we can weather any storm cause
We don't fear those cloudy skies
'Cause baby you and I
Got a love come rain or come shine.<start>NasÄ±l nasÄ±l da usulca kolay da bulunca bi de zorla mÄ± alcaktÄ±n kolay mÄ± sandÄ±n?

I've been wide awake
She hit me with a hand of broken nails
It hurts to give
When my heart has had too much to take
Another blow
Another broken spell
And it hits so hard
Heart fist
Love me to the head and hurts too bad
You're going all around
(I don't know why you can be so cold)
Oh yeah
It beats so hard into my chest
I prop my feet against the ground
(you've got to bite the hand that feeds you)
All right
I'm going down so why put up a fight
It's gonna hit me
It's gonna hit me
Heart fist
Don't leave another bomb to blow my head
It's gonna hit me
It's gonna hit me

Heart fist
Heart fist
Heart
Heart fist
Into the way of pumping blood from me
Alive before I drown

All right
You lure me to your bed of nails
And then hit me when I'm down
(you gotta bite the hand that feeds you)
All right
I'm going down so why put up a fight
It's gonna hit me
It's gonna hit me
Heart fist
Don't leave another bomb to blow my head
It's gonna hit me
Yeah, it's gonna hit me
Heart fist
You love to hit me when I'm down
And set me up again

I feel the pain that brings me to the ground
I feel another fist begin to pound
Bleed everything and love into submission
Cause I will hit you like a heart condition

You don't mean that much to me
Just another kiss to leave me when I'm down

Yeah it hits so hard<start>Going out alone tonight
And I don't even care
I've got an endless appetite
And something's in the air

And all I want is something new
I'm better off dancing without you
I can't hear a word you say
And I don't even care
I'm throwing all your notes away
Stop me if you dare

You don't have to show me how to move
Get out of my way, get out of my life

And all I want is something new
I'm better off dancing without you

When all the lights come on
And everybody's gone
I'll still be dancing
I'm better off dancing
I'm better off dancing without you

Will you forgive me for living?
Can't believe the things that they said
Wonderful day for a killing
It's killing me!
What do they do with your soul?
Is it just lying there busted?
When did you lose all control?
Is there someone to be trusted with my mind?
Oh there's insufficient evidence
Of what just might come after
But sometimes out of nowhere
There's demented sounds of laughter
Are we all haunted by the ghost - imagination?
It just can't be, I've seen them there howling at the moon
Is it just me or does somebody else, believe this
Well I'm not alone and I'm not afraid
There's just one way to see after all
After all
After all
After all
What do you say to the dead?
Is there a place where it's burning?
It says in a book I once read
Yes, there's a chance of returning
Turn to me
The fundamental principles
Say nothing of forever
But those are voices that I hear
Or I'm just not so clever
It can't be me I know somebody else, believes this
Well I'm not alone, I'm not afraid
Just one way to see after all
After all
Coming after all
After all
After all<start>There is nothing new
Put in front of you
Nothing you don't understand
Don't try to rationalize

You don't want to hear

Tell me that you've tries
Mind is open wide
But you're not listening at all
Please don't question me I don't have the time
If there's a problem that it's easier to set aside
There is nothing that will make you want to change your mind
You can't take it
You can't make it
You can't make it so why try?
There is nothing new put in front of you
Tell me that you've tried to
Tell me that your mind is open<start>I know your deepest thoughts the secrets you keep
The lies you choose to believe
You are just like me

You're the reason I believe
As long as I live
You are just like me<start>Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!
From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!
Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!
And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go "Ding dong ding dong ding!".
Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!
Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!
Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!
Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go "Ding dong ding dong ding!".<start>When you're tired

I will be yours
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

The waiting has worn and you are alone

A shoulder to lean on

I tried to say this
But now there's nothing left for me to do
And I've never been one to brag
Please don't go, just stay
I watched with tears in my eyes as you walked away
Miss your voice, and your touch
And if I told you I loved you could that be enough?
An awkward silence
It's been too long since I've heard from you
And I lay sleepless
Knowing that my heart still belongs to you
And I've never been one to brag
Please don't go, just stay
I watched with tears in my eyes as you walked away
Miss your voice, and your touch
And if I told you I loved you could that be enough?
Please don't go, just stay
I watched with tears in my eyes as you walked away
Miss your voice, and your touch
And if I told you I loved you could that be enough?

And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides
And a dark wind blows
The government is corrupt
And we're on so many drugs
With the radio on and the curtains drawn
We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine
And the machine is bleeding to death
The sun has fallen down
And the billboards are all leering
And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles
It went like this:
The buildings tumbled in on themselves
Mothers clutching babies
Picked through the rubble
And pulled out their hair
The skyline was beautiful on fire
All twisted metal stretching upwards
Everything washed in a thin orange haze
I said, "Kiss me, you're beautiful -
These are truly the last days"
You grabbed my hand
And we fell into it
Like a daydream
Or a fever
We woke up one morning and fell a little further down
For sure it's the valley of death
I open up my wallet
And it's full of blood<start>Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch
The band is playing "Dixie", a man got his hand outstretched
Could be the Fuhrer
Could be the local priest
You know sometimes Satan, you know he comes as a man of peace
He got a sweet gift of gab, he got a harmonious tongue
He knows every song of love that ever has been sung
Good intentions can be evil
Both hands can be full of grease
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace
Well, first he's in the background, and then he's in the front
Both eyes are looking like they're on a rabbit hunt
Nobody can see through him
No, not even the Chief of Police
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton
He could be standing next to you
The person that you'd notice least
I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull
I can smell something cooking
I can tell there's going to be a feast
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace
He's a great humanitarian, he's great philanthropist
He knows just where to touch you honey, and how you like to be kissed
He'll put both his arms around you
You can feel the tender touch of the beast
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace
Well, the howling wolf will howl tonight, the king snake will crawl
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall
Want to get married? Do it now
Tomorrow all activity will cease
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy
She's holding them little white shoes and that little broken toy
And he's following a star
The same one them three men followed from the East
I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace<start>I'll take you under my skin

Finding strength to call and ask her
Roller coaster, favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time
Leave me standing here
Act like I'm not around
The coast will probably never clear
Can I please go home now?
I had that dream
About you again
Where I wait outside
Until you let me in
And there I stayed
Lay beside me
And listen at the wall
We'll keep on lying
Until the summer comes
I had that dream
About you again
Where you drive my car
Right off a fucking cliff
And now I'm breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Roller coaster, favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time
Make me promise
That I will never tell
All I remember is
The way her bedroom smelled
I had that dream
About you again
Where I wait outside
Until you let me in
And now I'm breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Roller coaster, favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time

With gold medals and role models
Drugs and media and national pride
Why join in when you can watch it on tv?
So out of the stadiums!
Into the hills!
Out of the armchairs!
Onto the fells!
Staggering through mud and peat
Gasping breaths and sucked-in cheeks
Bogs like lead to clutch your feet
Through the rivers, over peaks
So out of the stadiums!
Into the hills!
Out of the armchairs!
Onto the fells!
Studmarks next to summit heather
Everything suddenly comes together
No audience viewing-figures
Just you against yourself
So out of the stadiums!
Into the hills!
Out of the armchairs!
Onto the fells!<start>Why did I come here tonight
With all these feelings inside

And all the pain that you hide

Wipe the tears from your eyes
But all that stands in the way is
That you don't realize
Why I
I am addicted, addicted to you
Like a bad pill, like a sick thrill
I can't get enough of you
I am afflicted, afflicted by you
Like a bad pill, like a sick thrill
I can't get enough of
You you
You you
I want you so bad tonight
That I can almost taste it
I want to take you away
Wipe the tears from your eyes
But all that stands in the way is
That you don't realize
Why I
I am addicted, addicted to you
Like a bad pill, like a sick thrill
I can't get enough of you
I am afflicted, afflicted by you
Like a bad pill, like a sick thrill
And when it all comes crashing down
Will you still love it
And if tomorrow never comes
At least I had it
I am addicted addicted to you
I'm addicted
I can't get enough of you
I can't get enough of you
I am addicted, addicted to you

That really has to mean she's going anywhere
I haven't seen it showing in her eyes
But I swear it must be there
I don't know why I feel it so strong
But I feel it just the same
I can't see a single storm cloud in the sky
But I sure can smell the rain
She'd still say 'I love you' if I ask
But she never volunteers
Somehow what she never says
Means more than all the other words I hear
Still she should win an Oscar
If she's lying when she says that nothing's changed
I can't see a single storm cloud in the sky
But I sure can smell the rain
Every day I brace myself
To hear the words I'm scared she's gonna say
And every night I thank the Lord
Somehow I dodged a bullet one more day
Sometimes there are things a man just knows
That he really can't explain
I can't see a single storm cloud in the sky
But I sure can smell the rain
I can't see a single storm cloud in the sky
But I sure can smell the rain<start>I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singin' in the wire,
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you,
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
And I need you more than want you,
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line<start>took it all and take it over
taking as much as you can see
i can almost think about it
but i cant arrange for you to see yeah
didnt know what im afraid of
i can learn it from a dream
theres a light that never goes out
burning a hole inside of me yeah
keep your lamps all trimmed and burning
might be alarmed with what you see
i agreed to always love you but never enough to set you free<start>Quei muri bassi
di pietra lavica
arrivano al mare
e da qui
ci passava ogni tanto
un bagnante in estate.
Sciara delle Ginestre
esposte al sole
passo ancora il mio tempo
a osservare i tramonti
e vederli cambiare
in Secondo Imbrunire.
E il cuore
quando si fa sera
muore d'amore
non ci vuole credere
che meglio
stare soli.
Cortili e pozzi antichi
tra i melograni
chiese in stile normanno
e una vecchia caserma
dei carabinieri.
Passano gli anni
e il tempo delle ragioni
se ne sta andando
per scoprire che non sono
ancora maturo
nel Secondo Imbrunire.
E il cuore
quando si fa sera
muore d'amore
non si vuol convincere
che bello
vivere da soli.<start>I wake up and wonder how everything went wrong.
Am I the one to blame?
I gave up and left you for a nowhere-bound train.
Now that train has come and gone.
I close my eyes and see you lying in my bed.
And I'm still dreaming of that day.
What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be.
Didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me.
And now that I'm alone, all I have is emptiness that comes from being free.
What could have been love will never be.
An old friend told me that you found somebody new.
Oh, you're finally moving on.
You think that I'd be over you after all these years.
Yeah, but time has proved me wrong.
'Cause I'm still holdin' on.
What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be.
Didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me.
(What could have been love)
And now that I'm alone all I have is emptiness that comes from being free.
What could have been love will never be.
We've gone our separate ways.
Say goodbye to another day
I still wonder where you are.
Are you too far from turning back?
You were slipping through my hands and I didn't understand.
What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be.
Didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me.
(What could have been love)
And now that I'm alone, all I have is emptiness that comes from being free.
What could have been love will never be.
What could have been love will never be.
What could have been love
What could have been love
What could have been love
What could have been
What could have been
What could have been love<start>In the middle of the summer
I'm not sleeping cold wind blowing
In the middle of the night they
Try to find me but I'm still driving
If you're going to San Francisco
Lay some flowers on the grave stone
There's music on the station
And I'm just listening to cold wind whistling
And if they ever find me
Tell the papers
Cold wind cold wind cold cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing
Hey hey hey
Something ain't right
Something ain't right
And if they ever find me
Tell the papers
Cold wind cold wind cold cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing<start>I used to be the first one to cry
So afraid of a lonely tomorrow.
Heartache was all that I had
To call my own- so all alone.
You came along and gave to my life
Something more than the pain and the sorrow.
Now that you're with me, we'll never be alone,
In love, in love.
Chorus:
I believe
In the love that you gave,
I believe
In the life that you saved,
I believe how you make me feel
Today
I believe in you
Night after night, I waited alone
For something deeper than yesterday's feelings.
Never believing that love would ever come
To me- oh no.
Then there was you, and out of the blue,
Once a heart that was broken was healing.
Love is the reason we'll never be alone,
Oh no- oh no
Chorus
I still believe,
Believe in something right.
'cause I love you for believing in me.
I believe in you.
Chorus<start>Light of the world,
You stepped down into darkness.
Opened my eyes,
Let me see.
Beauty that made this heart adore you
Hope of a life spent with you
And here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that you're my god
You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.
King of all days,
Oh, so highly exalted.
Glorious in heaven above.
Humbly you came
To the earth you created
All for love's sake became poor.
And here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that you're my god
You're altogether lovely.
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
And I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
No, I'll never know how much it cost
Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that you're my god
You're altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

Takes a bus every weekend just to come across the miles to me
Leaves her room in the shadow of the bridge
To spend two days life blind in my dirty bed
Doesn't asks questions, never talks down
About the things I do when she isn't around
Yeah I just about live in the bars around town
I lose myself in the voice of the crowd
Each and every day I need static
I don't wanna go home alone
I know a girl just outside of lacrosse
She meets me in milwaukee when the weather gets humid and hot
She leaves her husband and retarded baby girl
Just to walk for a while unencumbered in an easier world
No questions, never asks why
I walk the floor in the middle of the night and stare
Out the window of an ugly motel
At the neon signs outside
Think about the hell I sell
To make my static
I don't wanna go home, I don't wanna go home
I don't wanna go home alone...
Got a girl in saux st. marie
Takes a bus every weekend just to come across the miles to me
Leaves her room in the shadow of the bridge

Doesn't asks questions, never talks down
About the life I lead when she isn't around
Yeah, I just about live in the bars around town
Lose myself in the voice of the crowd
Walk around stupid and blind and proud
Each and every day I need static

I couldn't run, I know running gets old in a way
You sure know how to make or break a day
Well, you just fled the scene, so out of reach
You think a lot about yourself so much
For someone who relies on someone else's trust
I cower to your touch, you think I'd be the one to let go
So carry on
Thrilling to know there is no control
She's got the soul of a poet and the fire of a bullet
She is what she is, nothing less or unspoken
She don't love you no more, she's in love with her motive, yeah
This jealousy can't hold me over
I can't get mad, you know that anger gets all in your way
My jealous mind, it hates it but takes it
Those haunting memories are laced with secrets
Although I'm hard pressed and back from a fight
You think that this would end soon but it's taking its time
Confusion it is such an all time bad written melody
Of course you'd sing, please carry on
Thrilling to know there is no control
She's got the soul of a poet and the fire of a bullet
She is what she is, nothing less or unspoken
She don't love you no more, she's in love with her motive, yeah
Ask about her ways and her secret life
She'll say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ask her if she thinks she can sleep at night
She'll say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ask about her ways and her secret life
Ask her if she thinks she can sleep at night
Thrilling to know there is no control
She's got the soul of a poet and the fire of a bullet
Thrilling to know there is no control

She's in love with her motive, yeah<start>Everywhere I go someone's trying to be my girlfriend's best friend
I'm tryin' to pretend I'm relaxed but I'm playin' castonettes with my knees
I try to be cool and give her space but a guy's always there ready to jump right up and take my place
Everyone in this room seems to want to make a big fool outta me
Everybody open your mouth
Everybody just say ah (ah ah ah ah)
Everything will be alright if you play along
Everywhere I go there's someone in a trench coat staring at me
And when I'm not at home I'm sure someone's rummaging through my trash
What ever could they want from me?
Is it just a part of a giant government conspiracy?
I gotta go see my doctor about this itchy pentagram shaped rash
Everybody open your mouth
Everybody just say ah (ah ah ah ah)
Everything'll be alright, this won't hurt at all (turn it up)
Everybody get in line
Everybody turn and cough (ah ah)
Everything'll be alright if you just lay off
Dictate a memo to myself
Tryin' to finally find the only one in complete health
Consult contemporaries if there are some to see
There really isn't anyone who's in my lane
Every night at a lane, someone thinks they've got a find beyond me
I try to take three deep breaths as I walk up to my minivan
Everyone says I'm lookin' great but it's hard to stand up let alone to try to concentrate
I wish that everyone that I knew hadn't sold out to the man
Everybody open your mouth
Everybody just say ah (ah ah ah ah)
Everything'll be alright, this won't hurt at all
Everybody get in line
Everybody turn and cough
Everything'll be alright if you just lay
Everything'll be alright if you just lay
Everything'll be alright if you just lay off<start>Well I don't want to see you waiting
I've already gone too far away
I still can't keep the day from ending
No more messed up reasons for me to stay
Well this is not for real
Afraid to feel
I just hit the floor
Don't ask for more
I'm wasting my time
I'm wasting my time
You can't stop the feeling
And there's no reason
Let's make the call
And take it all again
Woah again
Months went by with us pretending
When did our light turn from green to red
I took a chance and left you standing
Lost the will to do this once again
Well this is not for real
Afraid to feel
I just hit the floor
Don't ask for more
I'm wasting my time
I'm wasting my time
You can't stop the feeling
And there's no reason
Let's make the call
And take it all
I'm wasting my time
I'm wasting my time again
Woah again
See you waiting
Lonesome, lonely
See you waiting
I see you waiting
Well this is not for real
Afraid to feel
I just hit the floor
Don't ask for more
I'm wasting my time
I'm wasting my time
You can't stop the feeling
And there's no reason
Let's make the call
And take it all
I'm wasting my time
I'm wasting...<start>She rolls the window down
And she
Talks over the sound
Of the cars that pass us by
And I don't know why
But she's changed my mind
Would you look at her
She looks at me
She's got me thinking about her constantly
But she don't know how I feel
And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she's figured out
I'm crazy for this girl
Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl
She was the one to hold me
The night
The sky fell down
And what was I thinking when
The world didn't end
Why didn't I know what I know now
Would you look at her
She looks at me
She's got me thinking about her constantly
But she don't know how I feel
And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she's figured out
I'm crazy for this girl
Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl
Right now
Face to face
All my fears
Pushed aside
And right now
I'm ready to spend the rest of my life
With you
Would you look at her
She looks at me
She's got me thinking about her constantly
But she don't know how I feel
And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she's figured out
I'm crazy for this girl
Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl
Would you look at her
She looks at me
She's got me thinking about her constantly
But she don't know how I feel
And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she's figured out
I'm crazy for this girl
Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl<start>Ways that, ways that i can mean
Ways that, ways that I can be
Over, ways that mean other,
Could you temp it out of me
Could you temp out my soul again
Wait up, I will die
Wait up I will die
Many ways that I could say, many ways
Many ways that I could sing, but I can't
What if the road on the cover
Many others than this
Would you like me if I fall in the ground like you did
Would like me now? if I fall in the ground you did
Im not going that far
Im just going the ways I know
Because I found a victory on the best ways that I'll be<start>Get some sticks and a set of wheels
Get to where it's going on
I'll bet with strange that's just like me
I can feel like I belong
Gettin' it straight - gettin' it set
Maybe someday they won't forget
That I'm out on a wire
I tried so hard to be like
To fit into your plans
But school for me and reality
Are hard to understand
Gettin' it cut - getting it straight
Being on time without being late
I'm out on a wire
It's tough for you to think like me
In a life with your demands
Your rules and laws just crowd me in
I've got nowhere left to stand
You've pushed and held, am I so wrong
To break away and go beyond
I'm out on a wire<start>When I saw the sign, it was the first day
Heading south to the north
I went the long way I came back
What's left you left me I left you
You-turns constantly
No stopping no stopping no stopping now
How many
How many killer on the road
I see the way home, the exit's closed now
Objects are closer than they appear
The sun is in my eyes and though I can't see you
If I don't see you anymore I'd be O.K.
No stopping no stopping no stopping now

O vento faz as luzes entre as<start>If the trials up here
Are really getting you down
You had a close call
I didn't even see it in another one
I hardly believed it all
What the writers say
It means shit to me now
Plants and animals
Appear on the bend when its 80 degrees
The end of December whats going on
Now before
You and me
In the showing up here
Its going back to the south
Were hungry next that I know
And running a blender in a lightning storm
The disguise is a blessing i'm sure
And growing up here
There comes a fork in the road
Pants have got to go
We're on an island on the 4th of July
It looks like the tide is going home<start>God ain't in his heaven
Something ain't right
I hear church bells ringing
In the middle of the night
They're dragging a man by his insides
Through the broad daylight
Thieves have their season sure
But it's getting on midnight
And the river's gonna rise
It's gonna rise
There'll be dancing in the street
When the river done rise
Cold wind is blowing
Flags flapping much too slow
The monkey men sell paradise
To the girls from Tupelo
Black shirted boys in the badlands
Play machine gun rodeo
The downtown missions packed too tight
With folks that got nowhere to go
But the river's gonna rise
It's gonna rise
And there'll be dancing in the street
When the river done rise
God ain't in his heaven
Something ain't right
The TV newsman smiles and says
The curfew starts tonight
They're killing a man from the inside
In the broad daylight
While the propped up puppet wags his head
And watches all the proud things die
But the river's gonna rise<start>What good am I some like all the rest
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry
What good am I?
What good am I if I know and don't do
If I see and don't say if I look right through you
If I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin' sky
What good am I?
What good am I while you softly weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try
What good am I?
What good am I then to others and me
If I had every chance and yet still fail to see
If my hands are tied must I not wonder within
Who tied them and why and where must I have been<start>I still hang on every word
In a world of faded memories
Where you're still in love with me
I can see it in your eyes
A look as if your major tom has lost control
I must hold on
This happens all the time
I still find my faith in you
I can't hold on
This happens all the time
I still find my way to you
If the dreams all that I got
Then I wish you in a fairy tale
Where you're still in love with me
I can see it in your eyes
A look as if your hero fell and lost his soul
I must hold on
This happens all the time
I still find my faith in you
I can't hold on
This happens all the time
I still find my way to you<start>Now I lay me down to sleep
And dream of my treasure map
It shows me the place my maypole's buried at
And I dream of all the fun I have
When my maypole comes out to play
Yeah, and I dream things I can't say
Or I'll get put away
So now, I better stop
Before I give them all away<start>Under the amazing sun
the ingrown tone speaks
to cancel out the tears
but i remember well
of once remembered states of emptiness
the water is rising
in your eyes to bleed and see
these empty walls are forming the tides
inside the rediscovered sky
I only exist as the sun
in truth as the pages turn now
of once remembered states of emptiness
the water is rising
in your eyes to bleed and see
these empty walls are forming the tides
these words of yours they say to me
theres something more you want from me
this heart you break
this life you take
I'll be in end
and with raised fists
and oceans in our eyes
we fear our fears
we fear we once controlled the sky
we fear right to the end
this one time right to the end.<start>Every night I lay my head
On my pillow on my bed
And I just cry myself to sleep
I know I shouldn't cry
Over words that were all lies
But still I cry myself to sleep
Each night I fight the tears
But still they fall
And all the memories linger on
He's gone he's gone
And now there's nothing but to cry
Cry myself to sleep
Still I cry myself to sleep
Each night I fight those tears
But still they fall
And all the memories linger on
He's gone he's gone he's gone
And now there's nothing but to cry
Ah, cry myself to sleep
Ah, cry myself to sleep
Ah, cry myself to sleep<start>You think that I'm made of money
You've got something coming, honey
This ain't no land of milk and honey
My accountant thinks that's funny
Instead of trying to use your brains
You sit 'round and suck my veins
Your kind of rat belongs in drains
You're gonna get around
You like all those big fancy cars
Trendy people and their wine bars
But your lying will leave its scars
Get around, get on your horse
You think that I'm made of reddies
That makes me choke on my Shreddies
I may smile and act so sunny
But this boy is not your dummy<start>I can't understand,
She let go of my hand
An' left me here facing the wall.
I'd sure like t' know
Why she did go,
But I can't get close t' her at all.
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime,
She said she would never forget.
But now mornin's clear,
It's like I ain't here,
She just acts like we never have met.
It's all new t' me,
Like some mystery,
It could even be like a myth.
Yet it's hard t' think on,
That she's the same one
That last night I was with.
From darkness, dreams're deserted,
Am I still dreamin' yet?
I wish she'd unlock
Her voice once an' talk,
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
If she ain't feelin' well,
Then why don't she tell
'Stead of turnin' her back t' my face?
Without any doubt,
She seems too far out
For me t' return t' her chase.
Though the night ran swirling an' whirling,
I remember her whispering yet.
But evidently she don't
An' evidently she won't,
She just acts like we never have met.
If I didn't have t' guess,
I'd gladly confess
T' anything I might've tried.
If I was with 'er too long
Or have done something wrong,
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run an' hide.
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played,
Her mouth was watery and wet.
But now something has changed
For she ain't the same,
She just acts like we never have met.<start>She gave away all her love
No reason to keep it
She'd saved it for only one
But he didn't need it
And downtown the midnight circus
Hypnotised like a spinning top
Offering dreams, like the gloss magazines
She had so much to give so she gave it away
And all of the loves you've known
There must have been someone
Who gave you that starry night
And whose gonna point the finger
Only those who never known
She lost and she cried, the tears run dry
She had so much to give so she gave it away
Mary was like you and I
She remembers how she lay with him
But to the world she's just a drunken cheap trick
Red light side kick, an angel downtown
The priest calls her Wednesdays
And shows her a wooden cross
He tells of the love he's found
She thinks of the one she lost
And downtown the midnight circus
Hypnotised like a spinning top
So easy to choose when there's nothing to lose
She had so much to give so she gave it away<start>Didn't know what time it was and the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll 'lotta soul, he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no D.J. that was hazy cosmic jive
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too
Switch on the TV we may pick him up on Channel Two
Look out your window I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la<start>remember we'd confide without a second guess
the feeling now a loss or maybe less
emptiness a feeling self regret
something i will never ever forget
the faces you have stepped on have been broken down
understand your motivation
guilt lies on
knowing you were desecrating
friendships gone
you threw it all away
something you should have known
we both were wrong
was left unsaid and it weights on me
it's just like you to be setting for less than nothing
you're making assumptions
my views mean nothing to you
remain half a step away without
mending the trust that has been torn apart
misunderstanding has left this all for naught
swallow your pride and let's slavage what we both knew
take down your guard
it will be dismissed<start>I'll take the best of your bad moods
and dress them up to make a better you,
'cause all the company calls amount to one paycheck.
I'd squeeze a heart through my fingertip,
but I type too slow to make expressions stick.
And it's like TV with a microchip.
[Chorus]
Set your sights, destroy this party line,
Cause it's so tired.
Set your sights, destroy this mock-shrine,
Cause it's so tired.
Let's cut our losses at both ends
and aim your car away from all our friends,
leaving the dishes stacked in the sink.
[Chorus]
I'd keep my distance 'cause the complications cloud it all,
and mail a postcard sending greetings from the Eastern Bloc.
Synapse to synapse: possibilities will thin or fade.
Your wedding figurines: I'd melt so I could drink them in,
and drink them in, and drink them in
I'll take the best of your bad moods
and dress them up to make a better you,
'cause all the company calls amount to one paycheck.
[Chorus: x2]<start>Just three days
And I'm missing you more
Than I thought I would
I miss you more
Than I'd like to say
I'm hanging on a hope
That's swinging form a rope
That's all the same
My biggest mistake
Was letting you get away
Oh baby
[Chorus:]
California sun
So bright and beautiful
Yeah but that was yesterday
How'd you slip away?
California sun
California sun
Been about a week
And I finally fall asleep
As the sun comes in
Through the broken blinds
Lying all alone
Sinking like a stone
Wish you were here
Can't sleep you off my mind
Oh no, baby
[Chorus:]
I'm searching door to door
Sunset down to the shore
Where'd you disappear
I wonder were you go
I don't really want to know
You can find me here
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]<start>When things get stale
You get on a boat and sail to Rio
The beaches and the sea
That's where I long to be
In Rio
But I'm workin' for the man every day up in the city
Got to get away on a boat around the corner
And it's waiting there for you and me
In Rio
Dark eyed lady
Drive Mercedes everywhere
In Rio
She said, "Do you want to take a ride?"
So I jumped right in beside her
In Rio
But I'm workin' for the man every day up in the city
Got to get away on a boat around the corner
And it's waiting there for you and me
In Rio
When things get stale
You get on a boat and sail to Rio
The beaches and the sea
That's where I long to be
In Rio<start>What lures what traps? Intentions are fast snaps, fast snaps
A simple high cage, from your whisper to rage
Every time, every single time
The bleeding obvious, bold as
You complain
The bleeding obvious, bold as
You complain, you complain
All of it adds, up to your trappled eggs?
No one knows why, you can't sell it
Lucky but how much, is give away you want to wear
Don't you, everybody does
The bleeding obvious, bold as
You complain
The bleeding obvious, bold as
You complain, you complain
Choose to be over, your own instincts
Glisten me down, glisten me down
Why can't we believe in ourselves, maybe even each other
So bleeding obvious, you complain
Happens over head, you scream
So bleeding obvious, bold as
You complain, you complain<start>A deep dark secret down at the bottom
But this bay can't keep it unforgotten.
And a story that was told has now grown taller than we'd ever wish to be
Beyond belief
I'll grab the boat if you go grab the anchor,
The tarp and twine and the weights that sank her.
They weren't enough look who showed up
A new light shed is shining through. Illuminating you as we lay
Side by side, dead and broken
Our lives aren't the same since the night yours went stolen.
Blood ran black beneath the moonlight. Your lover's blood ran cold,
Cutting off the hands he used to hold.
A deep dark secret down at the bottom
But this bay can't keep it unforgotten.
And a story that was told has now grown taller than we'd ever want to be
Beyond Belief.
Side by side, dead and broken
Our Hearts aren't the same since the night yours went stolen.
Blood ran black beneath the moonlight. Your lover's blood ran cold,
Cutting off the hands he used to hold.
We used to hold.<start>You may be sweet and nice
That won't keep you warm at night
Cause I'm the one who taught you how
To do the things you're doing now
He may feel all your charms
He may hold you in his arms
But I'm the one who let you in
I was right beside you then
Once upon a time
You let me feel you deep inside
And nobody knew, nobody saw
Do you remember the way you cried?
I'm your toy, I'm your old boy
But I don't want no one but you to love me
Oh I wouldn't lie
You know I'm not that kind of guy
Once upon a time
You let me feel you deep inside
And nobody knew, nobody saw
Do you remember the way you cried?<start>I met this girl
She looked like Axl Rose
Got drunk and took her home
And we slept in our clothes
And in the morning put
My feet on the floor
And thought
Being awake never felt
Like this before
And Julianne you know
She wouldn't approve
Talked all day on the phone
Cause I had nothing to do
Got rid of Axl by the afternoon
Being awake never felt
So clear and blue
[Chorus:]
That's all I knew
Guess that I was innocent too
I'll sing a song yeah
And it won't be the blues
Cause I don't miss Julianne
My friend she told me
She felt sorry for me
She said the truth would
Come crashing down on me
That I'd be sorry,
But the truth of it is
That I feel guilty for
Not giving a shit
[Chorus]
I got a bag of trash
I got my bag of trash
I walk it up and down
And drag it up and down
The road.
How could she miss a man
Who drags a bag of trash
Down the road?
Saw, what she ever
Saw in me aw hell no
This week I feel
Like I've been born again
I know that Julianne
She would have a fit
She'd find a reason for
The things that I did
And give me credit
For the things that I
Never been
Ohh, that's all I knew
Guess that I was innocent too
Yeah I can try just
As hard as I can
And I don't miss Julianne
Ah ooh that's all I do
Guess that I was innocent too
Yeah I can try just
As hard as I can
But I don't miss Julianne
[Chorus]<start>(Brooker / Sutherland)
Every Morning - sunrise dawning
Shadows lifting - night clouds drifting
Rolling away
Open your eyes from dreaming
Look to the sky - the sun is streaming down.
Lightning up the world to greet us like a friend
Lending a guiding hand until the twilight ends
- No don't give us up Mr. Blue Day
- Shine out just enough through the cold grey
To lead us home again.
Every morning sundown
Shades of darkness draw round
Day is slowly dying
Night birds homeward flying on their way
- Can't stop the night from falling
- Can't stop the shadows calling to us all
From another world of timeless mystery
Out floating helpless on some far and lonely sea
- So don't give us up Mr. Blue Day
- Shine out just enough through the cold grey
To lead us home again.<start>When I saw you, down at the lido
It was a hot Saturday night
Oh but you were on fire, and I was burning up
One look from you and I knew it'd be all right
We did the Bombanaza
(Chorus)
diki diki diki diki diki
Yeah, yeah
The Bombanaza
diki diki diki diki diki
oh, oh
The Bombanaza
diki diki diki diki diki
yeah, yeah
Well that moon, it was in the ocean
Oh but all the stars they were in your eyes
And I thought my heart might be lost forever
Oh But one look from you,
It brought it back to life
We did the Bombanaza
(Repeat Chorus)
Mambo baby, Mambo!
Some fools call it love
Some fools call it amore
Oh that feeling that'll come all over you
When your heart has come together
Well someone else's heart it never comes en route
That's the Bombanaza!
(Repeat Chorus)
Oh now when the earth, It begins to tremble
And when the ground, It begins to shake
In your heart, you're so filled with wonder
Oh it's so filled with love, you think the thing might break
That's the Bombanaza!
(Repeat Chorus)
You can not stop the Bombanaza!

Grab the bull by the horns the old addage goes.
Nobody tells you where to go from there.
I see whats grateful in you.
Decisions have to be made.
The the best half is the hardest earned.
Back and forth the struggle consumes us all.
Trying to keep a level head.
In the most unsettling of times.
Today I'll become the bull.
There is so much to stake.
I'll stumble I'll loose my place.
Crowded in while surrounded by sin.
Destiny takes its hold.
Fight it or let it go.
But I choose how the day will end.
Back and forth the struggle consumes us all.
Trying to keep a level head.
In the most unsettling of times.
Today I'll become the bull. [x2]
This small heart can get lonely.
I lose myself inside myself.
No one can touch you when you're outside staring in.
Remove myself from this rat race.
Back and forth the struggle consumes us all.
Trying to keep a level head.
The most unsettling of times.
Today I'll become the bull. [x5]<start>,

About mysterious lights in the sky
The magnetic poles start to shift
The world is chargin' at the speed of light
It's got somn' to do with an attitude
Not carin' if we live or die
Crowds start runnin', breathin,
Starin' at the sky
One more death means one more lie
Red Alert
Red Alert
Red Alert
Red Alert
Red Alert
Better take cover
Now that I'm much older
I can see a lot is over
And a lot has passed me by
I try to see the sun comin' over the hill
On a dark and dusty night
I wanna feel the way I used to
Guess the secret lies inside
But if you want the truth
Better hide tonight
One more death means one more lie
They won't save me [several times]<start>Take my time.
Take it easier.
Don't need no lines.
Cause my move are hot, and I never stop girl.
Hey, I know.
You've heard it all before, and you seen it all.
Hey, I know.
Its the same old song, its the same old song.
I'm the kind of guy that you ain't ever seen before.
If you want to hit the floor, are you ready for more?
I'm the kind of guy that it ain't easy to forget.
Girl, I'm gonna make you sweat.
Are you ready?
Are you ready for more?
I may not be nice.
I won't remember your name, girl.
The things you understand, they could never comprehend.
No.
No need to explain it.
Hey, I know.
I talk a lot, but I back it up.
You got.
Hey, I know.
You got me all wrong.
Got me wrong.
I'm the kind of guy that you ain't ever seen before.
If you want to hit the floor, are you ready for more?
I'm the kind of guy that it ain't easy to forget.
Girl, I'm gonna make you sweat.
Are you ready?
Are you ready for more?
Boy, I know what you're gonna say.
Or did you think I was born yesterday?
I know you must think, I got something to prove.
But girl, I really only want to hit the floor with you.

The cuts no longer bring me down
Don't you even bother
I've seen enough to take you down
Love, hate, pride
Bottled up inside
Let it go
I'm gonna let it go

(Bang) I'm invincible
I'm bulletproof
(Bang) I'm on a revolution
(Bang) I'm invincible
I'm bulletproof
Don't you know I'm bulletproof
The fight has made me stronger
I could never turn back now
Don't you point the finger
Your words no longer bring me down
I'm finally taking over
The truth has surfaced all around
The days are going under
I have risen up and can't be found
Love, hate, pride
Bottled up inside
Let it go
I'm gonna let it go
(Bang) I'm feeling super human
(Bang) I'm invincible
I'm bulletproof
(Bang) I'm on a revolution

Don't you know I'm bulletproof

You get tossed
You go running around
Until you know you're gonna fall off
He knows what you need he, knows how much, how much you want
Knock familiar,
Welcome in,
Can't believe that you let him
Introduce you as a friend.
But you're always polite
In case you need him again
No not again,
No not again.
Can't believe the way I see you
Run, run, run,
Can't believe the way you bleed when you
Run, run, run,
Are you having fun?
Run-
Hands are shaking. lips are cracked
You swore (I heard you swear) that you were
Never coming back, but
One more time. just one more night
And once again, you lost the fight
Fight
So fight a little harder now.
Can't believe the way you bleed when you
Run, run, run
Can't believe the way you need to
Run, run, run
Are you still as young as you started
When you started to run?
Can't believe the way I see you
Run, run, run,
Can't believe the way you bleed when you
Run, run, run,
Are you having fun?
Run, run, run,
'Till you drop.<start>In the old stairway
In the streams of rain
Your love is imprisoned
It's got only one queen
Golden heart
You laid at its feet
Had cracked before you understood
It will destroy you
With each step
With each gesture
It will destroy you
With each word
Bewitched by its melody
You drink off sounds
Deluded by a failure
You tempt fortune
From joy to suffering - short way
You'll defeat it
Though you know the end<start>Burning tree, blackened sky - this land God forsaken
A thousand men prepare to die - their spirit long been broken
In misery, hear their cry - mouths hang wide open
Flashing steel, hot lead - the white man has spoken
Painted smiling face
Pockets filled, lust fulfilled - the butchered know no mercy
Painted smiling face
Blind eyes, closed hearts - they do not remember
Brutal past from the start - no justice now forever
Humankind is but a part yet they find no answer
Harmony is the art these men refuse to master
Painted smiling face
It's clear, the end is near - this path leads to nowhere
Painted smiling face
Yeah, I see you
See right through you
And I hear you
But your words will never ring true
My mind is clearer now
At last I can see all too well
Deceiving shades are wearing thin
Humankind prefers living in hell
Painted smiling face<start>Well, I don't want a thing to do with you kind
And I ain't got no time to kill on your dime
Strung up, hanging 'round
Looking like you're upside down
Well, I ain't wanting to shed no blood, that's your crime
And I ain't wanting to sling no mud, I clean it up
You ain't what I'd call a friend
I wouldn't even if I could pretend
Man, you ain't like anybody else
As night becomes the sun to rise
As dirt becomes the butterflies
As sure as though it always seems to stay the same
And I'll be waiting anxiously
And I'll be falling fast asleep
And I'll be dreaming of the day the dream died
Uh huh
No sticks, no stones could break my bones like you can
If I knew hate, I'd call it love for you, man
High up on the hill, cheaper than a dollar bill
Man, you ain't like anybody else
Should we pretend that it's the end?
Are you my curse or are you my friend?
And if we got hit to the end of the road
Will you be there to carry my load?
I'm getting it back with that terrible feeling
My vision is cracked, but it looks like it's healing
I'm getting it back like it's four in the morning
When the sun only shines as if it's giving a warning
I'm getting it back with the rest of the leap year
I'm keeping the rabbit, the bat, and the reindeer
I'm getting it out, whatever I've gotta keep in
I'm telling the truth, said it don't win with pretend
Should we pretend?
Should we pretend?
Should we pretend?<start>Holding out, she knows what I'm about
I start to play the silent card
You make this easy or you play me like a shark
Arms folded, nose to the floor
If it's got to be a leap of faith
I wish somebody'd push me
That way I'd know who to blame
When we go out tonight
I'll be looking so far past the flashing lights
Finally open my arms wide
Finally I let you inside
Finally made it past the end
To finally begin
Weigh the pros but the cons come first
I've got a black belt in doubt
I get claustrophobic
All these open doors around
Still the pros are the hardest to ignore
I've never felt this light before
I took off my sunglasses
And waited for the words
When we go out tonight
I'll be looking so far past the flashing lights
Where and when
The hours we keep, the days we save
They add up to years, now face to face
With you by my side, now I can stand, to finally begin<start>Colors and numbers
And there's so many never be seen
It's not the big picture
Nothing
The system that we call the
And the areas of avid color
Their origins are undiscovered
Don't go trying
To reveal
defying
Your intelligence it will always be impossible
No human will ever live to reveal
The undiscovered numbers and colors
No man will live to see colors
Colors and numbers
And there's so many never be seen
It's not the big picture
Nothing
The system that we call the
No man will ever live to see the undiscovered
Numbers and colors<start>It would break your heart, if you knew me well.
See, I have run so far that I've lost myself.
And there are things I have seen that I never will tell.
They drove me out of my mind and inside of myself.
And oh, my my, it would break your heart,
If you knew how I loved you, if I showed you my scars,
If I played you my favorite song lying here, in the dark.
Oh my my, it would break your heart.
It would bring you to tears, if you knew what I know.
See, I spent all of my money on second hand love
But I trusted somebody way and back when.
And I loved her like fire until it drove me insane.
And oh, my my, it would break your heart,
If you knew how I loved you, if I showed you my scars,
If I played you my favorite song lying here in the dark.
Oh my my, it would break your heart.
And you can lean on me until your heart don't beat,
I'll leave you lying there on the floor.
You can lean on me until your heart don't beat,
I'll leave you spinning there on the floor.
And oh, my my, it would break your heart,
If you knew how I loved you, if I showed you my scars,
If I played you my favorite song lying here in the dark.
Oh my my, it would break your heart.
And oh, my my, it would break your heart,
If you knew how I loved you, if I showed you my scars,
If I played you my favorite song lying here in the dark.
Oh my my, it would break your heart.
Until it breaks your heart.<start>There used to be a time when I thought I had the answers
Answers to the questions that nobody knew
Used to be a time when I had some time
But when I had the time, I didn't know what to do
Wasted all those years never gettin? any younger
Times kept a changin? but I still got the hunger
Only trouble is the walls are closing in
Sometimes I want to give it all away
I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again
Maybe I?ll head down south to New Orleans
Wouldn't have no taxes ?cause I wouldn't have no means
Lookin' for a Genie that could fill my dreams
But dreams become reality and real ain't what it seems to be
I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again
I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again
Sick for the cure on this roller coaster ride
It can take you real low and it can get you real high
Just passin? time
But time ain't on our side
Ah, guitar
I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again
I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again
I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never comin' back again, alright<start>Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
On the very next day with a nose full of pus
Yea, heavy and a bottle of bread
Yea, heavy and a bottle of bread
Yea, heavy and a bottle of bread
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze too
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're headin' out
For Wichita in a pile of fruit

Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout

Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells

Just beyond the break
I should run and hide with the others
But I can't look away
She's a hurricane
And I hear thunder (hurricane, and I hear thunder)
But I won't run, I won't run
I wanna meet her
I wanna see her dancing in the street
I wanna feel her
I wanna hold her body close to me, yeah, yeah
But she's a hurricane
Oh, hurricane, yeah, yeah
Lost in the riot, peace and quiet, and the one I lost
I'll be buzzing, she'll be mine from dust to dust
She's a hurricane
And I hear thunder (hurricane, and I hear thunder)
But I won't run, I won't run
The sun is rising, the rain is falling
I wanna give you all that's left of me
I will run, I will run into the hurricane
(I will run, I will run)
(I will run, I will run) you're my hurricane
(I will run, I will run)
(I will run, I will run) you're my hurricane
Hurricane
She's a hurricane<start>[Instrumental]<start>Down where your paint is cracking
Look down you backstair buddy
Somebody's living there and
He don't really feel the weather
And he don't share your pleasures
No he don't share your pleasures
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he don't run to catch your ash
Everybody always wants to kiss your trash
Ah you can't help him
Nobody can
Now that he knows
There's nothing to get
Will you still place your bet
On the neighborhood threat
Somewhere a baby's bleeding
Somewhere a mother's needing
Outside a boy is lying
But mostly he is crying
And he just shouts in anger
You'll find him interesting
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he doesn't build for you
Everybody always wants to run with you
Ah you can't help him
Nobody can
Now that he knows
There's nothing to get
Will you still place your bet
On the neighborhood threat
You're so surprised he don't run to catch your ash
'Cause everybody always wants to kiss your trash
Ah you can't help him
Nobody can
Now that he knows
There's nothing to get
Will you still place your bet
On the neighborhood threat
On the neighborhood threat (a night in your face)
Don't place your bets (a night in your place)
On the neighborhood threat (will you still place your bets)
Don't place your bets (when the neighbor comes)
On the neighborhood threat (neighborhood threat)
Don't place your bets
On the neighborhood threat<start>Er sitzt die meiste Zeit am Fenster
mit einem Kissen unter'm Arm.
Ist ein Fahrrad auf dem Gehweg,
ist ein Wagen falsch geparkt?
Er ist allzeit bereit und schlgt Alarm.
Vor einem Jahr ging er in Rente,
nun wei er nicht, wie's weiter geht.
Sein Wellensittich ist der letzte,
der hin und wieder mit ihm spricht,
wenn er allein vor seiner Fototapete sitzt.
35 Jahre lang

35 Jahre lang
Haken fr den Duschvorhang.
Frher stand er mal am Flieband
in Halle 24 B.
Er war Kolonnenfhrer,
denn er hat sich hochgedient.
Die Stechuhr hat seinen Lebenslauf bestimmt.
Sein allererster Blaumann
hngt wie 'ne Uniform im Schrank.
Den Abschiedsbrief der Firma
hat er sich eingerahmt.
Er macht die selbe Frhstckspause wie in all den Jahrn.
35 Jahre lang

35 Jahre lang
Haken fr den Duschvorhang.<start>The time has come
Come undone
I gotta run
Im showing all the symptons
Im a receiver of the fever
And as you undress
What a mess I become
Take a slide a ride with me
Right down to the bottom
Castaway no escape no message
In this broken bottle
Entertain me
Sufforcate me
Open up lets have a look
Theres nothing here worth saving
Its not a mystery
When you asleep
With the dogs
You rise with the fleas
I gotta new diseas
I gotta new diseas
I gotta new diseas
Come on in
Look inside
Theres nothing left
Left here alive
Give it up like a slut
Give this creature
Back some of its life
Without a doubt you bring it out
The sickness starts to grow and grow
And grow
I gotta need
I gotta feed
Dont wanna leave
Dont wanna be no show<start>You're the one stepping on the back of my shoes
You're the one using me as a muse
You're the one with the jet pack strapped to your back ready to
go
It's you and her and nobody else the lights are low and she's so
ready
You're already on your way to the door
You're at the bar the tender gives you a free drink and winks,
she's perfect
You sweat bullets, spill the drink and you leave
Everyone leaves the party except a gorgeous twenty something,
you turn and run
You call me up
You're the one stepping on the back of my shoes
You're the one using me as a muse
You're the one with the jet pack strapped to your back ready to
go
So the way you act, is it just an act or some strange courtship
ritual
A habitual nervous reaction
Hey it's just me, set yourself free, why don't you let me know
what's going on
Inside your cluttered head
You're the one stepping on the back of my shoes
You're the one using me as a muse
You're the one with the jet pack strapped to your back ready to
go
What the hell are you talking about is that what you would say
If I were to wonder out loud would it make you turn away
Just a curious question
If it was you and me and nobody else would you want me to want
to be ready to go
Would you want to take the lights down low
You're the one stepping on the back of my shoes
You're the one using me as a muse
You're the one with the jet pack strapped to your back ready to
go
Hey it's just me, set yourself free, why don't you let me know
what's going on
Hey it's just me, set yourself free<start>Got you in the headlights
Of a stolen car
Sold my soul
Your TV your VCR
Deserve me, you deserve me
Deserve me, you deserve me
I'm your father's pimp
Your mother's whore
Your children all know my name
Come to score<start>Like an unsung melody
The truth is waiting there for you to find it
It's not a blight, but a remedy
A clear reminder of how it began
Deep inside your memory
Turned away as you struggled to find it
You heard the call as you walked away
A voice of calm from within the silence
And for what seemed an eternity
You're waiting, hoping it would call out again
You heard the shadow reckoning
Then your fears seemed to keep you blinded
You held your guard as you walked away
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all is not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness can show you the light
An unforgivable tragedy
The answer isn't' where you think you'd find it
Prepare yourself for the reckoning
For when your world seems to crumble again
Don't be afraid, don't turn away
You're the one who can redefine it
Don't let hope become a memory
Let the shadow permeate your mind and
Reveal the thoughts that were tucked away
So that the door can be opened again
Within your darkest memories
Lies the answer if you dare to find it
Don't let hope become a memory
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all is not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness can show you the light
Sickening, weakening
Don't let another somber pariah consume your soul
You need strengthening, toughening
It takes an inner dark to rekindle the fire burning in you
Ignite the fire within you
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all is not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness can show you the light
Don't ignore, listen to me now (all is not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light<start>She was just a girl who knew the way
I was so naive
Everything she ever said to me
I wanted to believe
I was close to too far gone
When she sat down and
Told me tenderly
Don't fall in love with me
I'll only break your heart
For us forever is just tomorrow
Don't fall in love with me
Don't let the fire start
If you should fall
I'm afraid I'll follow you
Now I'm on the other side of love
Lookin' right at you
There you are so young and sure
Your life has room enough for two
So it's up to me to try and say
Words that didn't stop me yesterday
Don't fall in love with me
I'll only break your heart
For us forever is just tomorrow
Don't fall in love with me
Don't let the fire start
If you should fall
I'm afraid I'll follow you<start>Look at the man in the corner
He's sitting all alone
His blankets are made out of cardboard
And his pillows are made out of stone
Every face tells a storcy
It never tells a lie
Every face tells a story
It never tells a lie
See the man walking on the water
See the light in his eyes
He came into the world with a message to tell
He came into the world to die
Every face tells a story
It never tells a lie
Every face tells a story
It never tells a lie
You're always telling stories
You're always telling me lies
You're always telling stories, why?
So think of yourself in the water
Seeing your days flashing by
It's too late to see what you wanted to be
You've spent all your time, you must die
Every face tells a story
It never tells a lie
Every face tells a story
It never tells a lie, oh
You're always telling stories
You're always telling me lies
You're always telling stories, why?
Why don't you step down
And make it work out right
I'm trying to get to you with my warning
Been here for nearly half the night
Look it's nearly four in the morning<start>If I had my way I would not be here
Not for one day, my leaving is clear
I've had my share of heartache and pain
For happiness I'm searching in vain
I've got to get rid of my ball and chain
For all of my life, the times they've been bad
And hard luck and strife, they're all I've ever had
I've had my share of heartache and pain
For happiness I'm searching in vain
I've got to get rid of my ball and chain
I've just got to be free
God in heaven, help me
If I had my way I would not, would not be here
No, not for one day, my leaving, my leaving is clear
I've had my share of heartache and pain
For happiness I'm searching in vain
I've got to get rid of my ball and chain
Help me!
I've had my share of heartache and pain
For happiness I'm searching in vain
I've got to get rid of my ball and CHAIN!<start>O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight
For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And peace to men on earth
How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven
No ear may hear His coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him still
The dear Christ enters in
O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel<start>I understand your point of view
So what do I say
I've been so underwhelmed before
You've got a lot to prove
Somewhere lines get crossed it's true
It's the nature of things
The longer we can see it through
The more we make believe
Baby likes a blue sky
I don't mind if it's gonna rain on me sometime
Maybe got her mind made up for sure
Baby won't you come back home?
All the people that we love
Disappoint us the most
Makeshift friends and low demands
We're running outta time
My late night call
One way to fall
I miss you still<start>Her spine is tingling, her mind lingering
Way back a year ago,
The name's on the door, yeah she's changed a lot more
I'll tell you how I know
Later on we dropped her off, she was mad at first
In a fog, what does she want, to throw it in reverse
And with that boredom, the burden's grown too much
She waits for help to come, but nothing ever does
Later on we dropped her off, she was mad at first
In a fog, what does she want, to throw it in reverse
She'll let herself go, won't work it over
She'll burn the house down, then run for cover
She'll slip into a hot bath and then sleep
Later on we dropped her off
In a fog, what does she want?
What does she want?
What does she want?<start>Form, the wordless truth that burns so long, so long
It runs me through
Come in blur and light that turns so wide, so wide
I'm purified
The blood, my love, my soul mixed in with you
The life, I now live you, new wine
The meld, the mix, the blue shifting power
The word to the letter, I breathe you in
Shape this dark divine
From sleep so long, so long to mystify
Come in slur and slide and dim so bright, so bright
You are glorified
The blood, my love, my soul mixed in with you
The life, I now live you, new wine
The meld, the mix, the blue shifting power
The word to the letter, I breathe you in
The blood, my love, my soul mixed in with you
The life, I now live you, new wine
The meld, the mix, the blue shifting power
The word to the letter, I breathe you in
Breathe you, breathe you, breathe you
Breathe you, breathe you
Breathe you, breathe you<start>Well, I wake up burnin' in a soaking sweat
My pillows are drippin' and the sheets are wet
I jump out of bed and I turn on the light
This happens to me every night
Sometimes you turn into a snake with long black hair
Then you turn into an angel, blonde and fair
You can turn yourself blue and I don't care
You can change your look
You can change your race
But it's always your touch
And always your face
[Chorus:]
Dirty dreams
How you want to do me
Dirty dreams
Let me get through
Dirty dreams
A triple X-rated movie starring me and you
Well, I close my eyes
And you open your lips
There's a shock from my head to my fingertips
I fall through a hole 'cause I can't get a grip
The room starts to spin and the world starts to turn
My heart catches fire and my bed starts to burn
Dirty dreams
How you want do me
Dirty dreams
Anything for you, babe
Dirty dreams
Technicolor movie starring me and you
Make my dreams come true
Shake my nights
Rattle my sleep
Roll my eyes, I'm in too deep
[Chorus]<start>I'm under your spell
Ain't nobody's business
I'm already there
It ain't nobody's business
Baby.. say..
Every time he walks out the door
I wonder if he's ever coming back
I can't help but love the taste of danger baby
And the how and the when and the roughness baby
I got caught out in the rain
If I die I don't care, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love with this man
I got caught out, caught out
Caught out in the rain
I heard him crying in his sleep last night
No man wants to be told he been crying
When he wakes up I tell him it's gonna be alright
But I know that he knows that I'm just relyin
I heard he shot a man down in the street
And it torn his soul apart
Last night when he was making love to me
There was a, another woman in his house
I got caught out in the rain
If I die I don't care, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love with this man
I got caught out, caught out
Caught out in the rain
In the rain..
I got caught out in the rain
If I die I don't care, I don't care
I'm in love, I'm in love
I got caught out, caught out
Caught out in the rain
In the rain..
His name
His pain

A little down the line
The jungle and the plains and peaks
Are scheduled to be mine
I'm gonna be the ruler
Of most everything around
From the grandest of the mountains
To the humble common ground
My reign will be a super awesome thing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
I'm gonna be a noble king
Unscrupulously fair
I only need a little time
Perhaps a little hair
I'm gonna be the mane event
Like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my roar
The fauna and the flora gonna swing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
No one saying do this
No one saying be there
No one saying stop that
No one saying see here
Free to run around all day
I'll be free to do it my way
No one saying do this
No one saying be there
No one saying stop that
No one saying see here
Free to run around all day
Free to do it my way
The time has come as someone said
To talk of many things
May be true
But I would rather stick to talking kings
It's easy to be royal
If you're already leonine
It isn't just my right
Even my left will be divine
The monarchy is waiting to go zing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
Oh, I just can't wait to be king<start>Dark in the city night is a wire

And catch my breathing even closer behind
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
In touch with the ground
I'm on a hunt down after you
Smell like I sound I'm lost in a crowd.
And I'm hungry like the wolf.
Straddle the line in discord and rhyme
I'm on a hunt down after you.
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Stalked in the forest too close to hide
I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
High blood Drumming on your skin it's so tight
You feel my heat I'm just a moment behind
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
In touch with the ground
I'm on a hunt down after you
Scent and a sound. I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf.
Strut on a line it's discord and rhyme
I howl and I whine I'm after you
Mouth is alive all running inside
And I'm hungry like the wolf.
Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
Burning the ground I break from the crowd
I'm on the hunt down after you
I smell like I sound. I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line it's discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt down after you
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf<start>seven miles the end of all is near

Until the bitter taste is gone
These images then burn my eyes
Like the thumbprints of the sun
Come, come everything to please me
Candy canes on parade
Lay me in the sun till every trace is gone
I am bleached away, bleached away
Oh sugar pill I believe you
Oh sugar pill I wanna eat you up up up up
Now I am blissed out
I have kaleidoscope eyes
I'm light as cotton
I am wide as the sky
This is where my thoughts come to die
And I am happy
Oh sugar pill I believe you
Oh sugar pill I wanna eat you up up up up.<start>It's been one of those days when the sky falls down
And the world around me comes crumbling down
I'm picking up the pieces of the life that she left behind
I've got a million of her lies swimming in my head
And a million reasons why I wish we never met
Cause everyone believed our love was true
And didn't see the pain that I went through
No one knows
She crushed my heart; she broke it with a hammer
No one knows
All the things I've done to try to understand her
No one knows
I've died a thousand deaths ever since she left me there
Yeah she left me there
'Cause she didn't care
I've been stuck here in my room going crazy by myself
And I'm setting fire to your pictures on the shelf
I know I should have thrown them all out a long time ago
Well I've never been a man that lives with regret
I forget to live and I live to forget
How everyone believed our love was true
And didn't see the pain that I went through
No one knows
She crushed my heart; she broke it with a hammer
No one knows
All the things I've done to try to understand her
No one knows
I've died a thousand deaths ever since she left me there
Everybody thought that we were doing fine
But deep inside we were doing time
And in the end she ran off with my soul
Sometimes it's hard to say good-bye
I gave her everything; she took my pride
And now I don't know where I'm gonna go
No one knows
Crush my heart; she broke it with a hammer
No one knows
All the things I've done to try to understand her
No one knows
I've died a thousand deaths ever since she left me there<start>Deliciously
I drink up all your tears
On a piano out of tune
I sit and persevere
Deliriously
I eat up all your words
And jumble them around
'Til they become absurd
Remember how it was
They said it wouldn't last
You proved them wrong
Took on everyone
Ferociously
We fumble in the dark
Two lovers acting like strangers
Society won't cage
Remember how it was
They said it wouldn't work
You proved them wrong
Took on everyone
Like a clock that can't keep time
Bad thoughts to hide
Or a poem that can't ever rhyme
Now strangers sing, this song for her
Mao mao mao
Oh remember how it was
They said it wouldn't last
You proved them wrong
Took on everyone
Remember how it was
Remember how it was<start>Un petit khmer rouge est dans une mer noire

Purify my heart
Spirit, fall on us
Spirit, fall on us
CHORUS x2
His fire never sleeps
(Fire)
Fire never sleeps
(Fire)
Your fire never sleeps
(Fire)
Your fire never sleeps<start>On a winter's Sunday I go
To clear away the snow
And green the ground below
April all an ocean away
Is this a better way to spend the day?
Keeping the winter at bay
What were the words I meant to say
Before you left
When I could see your breath lead
Where you were going to
Maybe I should just let it be
And maybe it will all come back to me
Seeing, oh, January, oh
How I lived a childhood in the snow
And all my teens in tow
Stuffed in strata of clothes
Hail the winter days after dark
Wandering the gray memorial park
A fleeting beating of hearts
What were the words I meant to say
Before she left
When I could see her breath lead
Where she was going to
Maybe I should just let it be
And maybe it will all come back to me
Seeing, oh, Janu...
Oh, January, oh<start>I'm not sure what they said
But if it's true I'll bet
It's just one more thing I'll regret
I hate my weaknesses, they made me who I am
"Yeah, it's cool I'll be ok"
As I felt your pain wash over me
I dry your eyes and hide my shakes
Cause I hate the look that's on your face
These things inside my head
They never make much sense
So I wouldn't hold my breath
I hope I die before they save my soul
"Yeah, it's cool I'll be ok"
As I felt your pain wash over me
I dry your eyes and hide my shakes
Cause I hate the look that's on your face
Don't hang up because I don't have anyone left here
Don't give up, don't hang on to anything I've said
I hate my weaknesses, they made me who I am
It makes no difference, I'm insignificant
This is not the end for us<start>Castaways, gypsies of the dawn
Angels out of darkness with
Nowhere to belong
Bound together, we've been cast
Into the storm
Castaways, children of the damned
Abandoned by the future and the
Past can't understand
You've never had a change since
Your journey began
Castaways, misfits out of time
Tomorrow it won't matter and
Yesterday's behind
You won't live forever, you've got
Tombstones in your eyes<start>She said oh my, I don't know why
I was just busy watching everyone go by
Outside the shite bar, and you're a red car
Me and your girlfriend and your sister with the big scar
I said oh Christ, I told you twice
It's just not easy going through all these things thrice
What's this I wonder, you drive a bluebird
You got no money for the petrol, that's what I heard
And it's all right, she'll be sucking fingers all night
Wearing those shoes, oh any excuse to go to the gang fight
And oh she's alright, everybody says she's uptight
Sick in the head, first in the bed
So easy to be Friday's nightmare
I said oh no, oh please just go
You got no eyelids and sweet ella loves me so
She got my number, though I can't stand her
I can't help diggin her a hope I guess I wonder
And oh it's clear, you want me dear
It would be easier if I was never here
You got the money, and I got the reason,
I'll stick around with you for just another season
And it's alright, she'll be sucking fingers all night
Wearing those shoes, oh any excuse to go to the gang fight
And oh she's alright, everybody says she's uptight
Sick in the head, first in the bed
So easy to be Friday's nightmare
She's just getting along,
So don't tell me she's yours
Oh please tell me I'm wrong again
It's all in a daze/day,
So what can you say
Just; sleep in yer shoes
With the winterbox blues
Any time you choose, Oh yeah
She said oh my, I don't know why
I was just busy watching everyone go by
Outside the shite bar, and you're a red car
Me and your girlfriend and your sister with the big scar
She said oh Christ, I told you twice
It's just not easy going through all these things thrice
What's this I wonder, you drive a bluebird
You got no money for the petrol, that's what I heard
And it's alright, she'll be sucking fingers all night
Wearing those shoes, oh any excuse to go to the gang fight
And oh she's alright, everybody says she's uptight
Sick in the head, first in the bed
So easy to be Friday's wonder<start>Estoy presente, aunque no me veas
Yo existo por que existen mis ideas
Defiendo mi pasado contra cualquier rayo
Mientras mas profundas las raÃ­ces mas largo es el tallo
Un Ã¡rbol no se cae cuando las raÃ­ces estÃ¡n bien sembradas
La erosiÃ³n del suelo, mi piel no la siente
Siego caminando por que me adapto al medio ambiente
Cuando nace la duda, muere la fe
DespertÃ© preguntÃ¡ndome cuando dÃ³nde y que?
Madre tierra felicidad y miseria
Todos somos tiempo, espacio y materia
Lo que aprendÃ­ todo lo que olvide
Lo que no encontrÃ© todo lo que busque
Lo que no te di todo lo que te doy
Lo que deje ayer lo que me vino hoy
Alguien trazo tu camino dentro de la selva
Todo te lo dio sin nada a cambio
Alguien besÃ³ tu frente con la boca fresca
Y cada noche te puso un Ã¡ngel en tu cuarto
TÃº, quien eres tu
Si no existiera madre tierra
TÃº, quien eres tu
Si no existiera madre tierra
Si no existiera
Si no existiera madre tierra
Si no existiera
Tocar acariciar, golpear, pegar
Sudar expulsar, destilar, traspirar
Escuchar, atender, percibir, oÃ­r
Empezar, terminar, nacer y morir
TÃº, quien eres tu si no existiera madre tierra
TÃº, quien eres tu
TÃº, quien eres tu si no existiera madre tierra
TÃº, quien eres tu<start>Citizens with a secret in our hands
That could ignite our shadow lands
Light it up and let it go
Let it shine with love and grace and redesign
A ray of hope for the common man
Light it up and let it go
Woah, we've gotta give it away
And there's a price to pay
When we give it away
Break the silence, break the silence
Cross every boundary that divides us, divides us
Break the silence, break the silence
Cross every border that divides us, unite us
[Incomprehensible]
We turn the page to a future just begun
If heaven is real then let our heaven become
Peace on earth, let it flow
We raise our voice where the color's all but gone
Paint the world with redemption songs
Stir it up and let it flow
Woah, we've gotta give it away
And there's a price to pay
When we give it away
Break the silence, break the silence
Cross every boundary that divides us, divides us
Break the silence, break the silence
Cross every border that divides us, unite us
Break the silence, break the silence
Cross every boundary that divides us, unite us
We've gotta give it away
We've gotta give it away
We've gotta give it away, give it away
So break the silence, break the silence
Break the silence, break the silence
Cross every border that divides us, unite us<start>I have personally won over...
Well
Lookin' like a muscle man
You crawled out from the swamp
Slimy, wild, you honey child
Give me your hump
You done my brain in
Whahh!
You done my brain in
Right in
And I just can't handle it
Wooo!
You done my brain in!
Hallelujah!
Don't kiss me with your silver lip
Don't kiss me with your eye
For god's sake, gimme a break
Let me crawl away and die
You done my brain in
Whaah!
You done my brain in
Right in
And I just can't handle it
Whaah!<start>Well, I don't care if the sun don't shine.
I get my lovin' in the evening time
When I'm with my baby.
Well, it ain't no fun with the sun around.
I get going when the sun goes down
And I'm with my baby.
Well, that's when we're gonna kiss and kiss and kiss and kiss,
And we're gonna kiss some more.
Who cares how many times we kiss,
'Cause at a time like this, who keeps score?
Well, I don't care if the sun don't shine
I get my loving in the evening time
When I meet my baby.
Well, that's when we're gonna kiss and kiss and kiss and kiss,
And we're gonna kiss some more.
Who cares how many times we kiss,
'Cause at a time like this, who keeps score
Well, I don't care if the sun don't shine
I get my loving in the evening time
When I meet my baby.
And it don't matter if it's sleet or snow,
The drive-in's cozy when the lights are low
And I'm with my baby.
Makes no difference if the rain comes down
I don't notice when she's around.
Oh boy, what a baby.
Well, that's when we're gonna kiss and kiss and kiss and kiss
And we're gonna kiss some more.
Well, one kiss from my baby doll makes me hot
More more more more.
Well, I don't care if the sun don't shine
I get my loving in the evening time
When I meet my baby.
Well, that's when we're gonna kiss and kiss and kiss and kiss and
We're gonna kiss some more.
Well, one kiss from my baby doll makes me hot
More more more more.
Well, I don't care if the sun don't shine
I get my loving in the evening time
When I'm with my baby.<start>I was thinking about miracles
When you were fast asleep
Of all the things we tried to find
It's only love we keep
And I don't ever want to wake you
Your dreams are taking you so far
It's there that I can always touch you
For love is where you are
(CHORUS)
Fall upon me, take love from me
Nothing is more beautiful to see
Walk beside me, grow inside me
All I have, you gave to me
Each day another miracle
That time can never take
If time should come to claim you now
He knows it's much too late
So let the gates of dawn fly open
And cast your light for all to see
The chains of morning now are broken
And you are drifting into me
CHORUS (x2)<start>Written by Tommy Shaw, Jack Blades, Ted Nugent
Ooooh ya got busted
On a midnight ride
And now ya want justice
Well, just step inside
He's gonna roll ya
Like a loaded gun
You pulled the trigger
I heard the shot
You better get your mother
Ready or not
Goin' down (Goin' down)
Bonestripper
Ya don't know what ya got
Until you turn to MrÃ¢?Â¦
(Goin down)
Mr. Bonestripper
Do ya feel lucky
Are you ready to pay
Do ya feel guilty
'Cause it's judgment day
He's got a notion
You'll never see the sun come up again
You make a motion
But he make the law
You're guilty, son
So down you go
Goin' down (Goin' down)
Bonestripper
You don't know what you got
Until you turn to MrÃ¢?Â¦
(Goin down)
Mr. Bonestripper
Time to take your medicine son
He's got a notion
You'll never see the sun come up again
You'll make a motion
But he makes the law
You're guilty, son
So down you go
Bet you wish you was never born
c'mon
Goin' down (Goin' down)

Until you've seen her MrÃ¢?Â¦
Going down down down down
Mister Bonestripper
I'm goin' down
Yes, I'm goin' down down
Down down down down down down down
Yeah down down<start>There's a breeze that's blowin' in from the land
Instead of salt air all we breathe in is sand
Crippled the cloud that once brought the rain
Good job, now we'll never see our coasts again
But those of us, those of us, us of lesser gods
Won't eat till we're hungry, won't drink till we're parched
But those of us, those of us who forget where we're from
Create now this hell where no devil could spawn
Take me back, take me back
To the way life used to be
A whisper's now sayin' what words used to speak
Starve must the child, hungry sex on TV
For no act of contrition will pardon the soul
The damage now glistens, see how it glows
But those of us, those of us, us of lesser gods
Won't eat till we're hungry, won't drink till we're parched
Those of us, those of us who forget where we're from
Create now this hell where no devil could spawn
Take me back, take me back
To the way life used to be
Yesterday is better than it is today
And today will be better, tomorrow they say
We don't want what you know but we know what we want
That's live and let live, we're all different that counts
But those of us, those of us, us of lesser gods
Won't eat till we're hungry, won't drink till we're parched
And those of us, those of us who forget where we're from
Create now this hell where no devil could spawn
Dark is the shallow man, proud without pride
Worn out comes the welcome from a truth that never lies
Weep now for the tear, cold on the face
So come down from your heaven, Lord
Let me show you hell on earth
Take me back
To the way life's never been<start>I wish I was in the land of cotton,
Old times there are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixie land
I wish I was in Dixe
Away, away
In Dixie land I'll take my stand
To live or die in Dixie
Away, away, away down south in Dixie
Amen<start>This choke hold is driving me away from your world.
Far from complying, I'm so drenched in spite,
I'd chew off my own feet before stepping in line.
Crawl back out to be pushed down.
Come lay down to be dissolved...
(chorus)
Once again you waste what little time we have,
setting limits on a bright and open future,
fueling me with a wealth of cold dissent
and dreams of our extinction.
Keep both eyes away from the damage,
and it is so easy to hide from your mistakes.
He crawls back out to be pushed down.
He won't lay down to be dissolved.
(chorus)
Afraid of being replaced,
the old turn into barricades shouting praises of control.
(break)
Cutting all connection to your reasoning.
Clutching to this failed methodology.
Rebellion is the bastard of conformity.
Choose to step in line or choose your misery.
Choose your misery...<start>She came to and her
Whole life was how she remembered it
She had a mouth full of fur
And she was laughing
She parked her hearse across
Three spaces posted motorcycles only
And jumped out shouting
Wha the cus could make a nice girl like us
Feel so lonely?
Are you weary as water
In a faucet left dripping
With an incessant sadness
Like a sad record skipping
And an ugly and ornery
And shadowy dread
Lurking like a troll under the bridge
Between your heart and your head
Please dumb blind kind sir
Lend little miss listless a little bit of Christmas
She's been a real good girl
But now she's stuck here
The world is so little and still
Mysterious and ominous as ever before
Like an unmarked bottle of pills
On the shelf right next to the thing
You were reaching for
Swing the groove 'round here
Where I can reach it
When I get my ass back on track
I'm gonna need it
Swing shift til I get the money
To buy me and my baby a moon full of honey
Then I'm gonna turn off the nagging voices
Inside my head
That follow me to bed and say
You suck
If you dig it on the sound
Break it down
No walls up, break it down
Break it down
Happiness spread it all around
Break it down
Racism stomp it in the ground
Break it down
So if you dig it on the sound
Break it down
No walls up, break it down
Break it down
Ignorance stomp it in the ground
Break it down
Happiness spread it all around
Break it down
Check, who said folk and hip-hop can't latch
Put us together on the stage and light a match
Kaboom, guess who stepped in the room
Sweeping you off your feet like we had a broom
With Ani Difranco and Maceo
Add a little freestyle flow and who knows
Put a little scratchin' into the mix
And it's enough to get you high if you need a fix
So, if you dig it on the sound
Break it down
No walls up, break it down
Break it down
Ignorance stomp it in the ground
Break it down
Happiness spread it all around
Break it down
If you dig it on the sound
Break it down
No walls up, break it down
Break it down
Racism stomp it in the ground
Break it down
Happiness spread it all around
Break it down
So, if you dig it on the sound
Break it down<start>Eyo, our band straight sucks
we have sex with ducks
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
we suck
we suck
we're the worst band since the people who sang that barbie girl song
and we fight all the time
and skip concerts like we're hot shit
but really we just suck big dicks
we don't show because we can't perform live for DICK!!!
and all our songs suck
because we have no musical abilities
and our lead singer wouldn't even make it on american idol
clay aiken owns our anuses hard
harder
harder
I never wash my hair<start>All night long my body burned, the sheets were wet and cold
The lights were on, my eyes were gone, and any second lose control
The pounding in my window or just the pounding in my head
I wonder who was in my room last night.
Who the hell was in my bed?
There must have been a body there
I swear I smelled some flesh
It took a little time but I figured they were mine
There were fingers going down my chest
My mouth went through the ceiling and my body fell to the floor
I couldn't find a key cause there was nothing I could see
And so I ran through the door
The cops, the priest, the crisis line, and no one really had a clue
No one to tell us who was touchin' me
Or exactly what I could do
My throat was dry my hopes were high
But nothing really ever got said
But who was in my room last night?
Who the hell was in my bed?<start>You
With the past at your back
And the future unsure
Asked
For the chance to try
Love once more.
Well aware of the consequences
Should the dream fall through
You threw down you last defenses
Wanting to try something new
Wanting to try something new.
You found me
In a sea of confusion
Drifting with the tide
Living
On love that had long since died.
But everytime that I touch you, baby
I feel a little more alive
And I`m reminded how much you`ve
made me
Believe in the love that survives
Believe in the love that survives.
Lessons learned are like
Bridges burned
You only need to cross them but once
Is the knowledge gained
Worth the price of the pain?
Are the spoils worth the cost of the hunt?
Are the spoils worth the cost of the hunt?
Borne
On the first warms winds of
Feelings newly found
Fly
But remember
Don`t look down
Take as much as you think you ought to
Give just as much as you can
Don`t forget what your failures have taught you
Or else you`ll learn them all over again
Or else you`ll have to learn them
All over again.
Lessons learned are like

On a lonesome highway it was gettin' late
Not another set of headlights on the interstate
I was miles from nowhere my only friend around
Was a country station fadin' in and out
And the road went on and on
But it just kept hangin' on
I can live with the static Lord but
I can't turn it off
It might not be clear and strong
And sometimes it's here and gone
Long as it keeps comin' back
I can't turn it off
I was feelin' kinda desperate as the sun came up
They played "Hello Darlin'" and it was breakin' up
The signal on that lighted dial was barely comin' through
And I knew in a few more miles it'd be gone for good
And the road went on and on
But it just kept hangin' on
I can live with the static Lord but
I can't turn it off
It might not be clear and strong
And sometimes it's here and gone
Long as it keeps comin' back
I can't turn it off
Be a long ol lonely ride without it
When I can't hear enough
Oh I just turn it up
And the road went on and on
But it just kept hangin' on
I can live with the static Lord but
I can't turn it off
It might not be clear and strong
And sometimes it's here and gone
Long as it keeps comin' back
I can't turn it off<start>I'm waiting for the man
Twenty six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington, One Two Five
So sick and dirty more dead than alive
I'm waiting for the man
Hey white boy, what you doing uptown?
Hey white boy, you're chasing all the women around
Oh pardon me sir it's furthest from my mind
I'm just looking for a good friend of mine
I'm waiting for the man
Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
PR shoes, and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is that you've always got to wait
I'm waiting for the man
Brown stone building and three flights of stairs
Nobody stops you 'cause nobody cares
He's got the works and he gives you sweet taste
But then you've got to split because you've got no time to waste
I'm waiting for the man
Baby don't you holler, darling don't you scream and shout
I'm feeling good, I'm going to work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling so fine
Until tomorrow but that's just another time
I'm waiting for the man
I'm waiting for the man
Twenty six dollars lying there in my hand
Up to Lexington, One Two Five five
So sick and dirty more dead than alive
I'm waiting for the man<start>There's a little boy out in the driveway
His basketball in hand
Saying Daddy could we play a little one on one
You pat him on the back and say not now son
I'm a busy man
His sister's out on the sidewalk
Setting up a lemonade stand
Hey Daddy don't you want to buy a glass from me
You say maybe later, can't you see I'm a busy man
[Chorus]
You got to go, got to run
Hit it hard and get it done
Everyone can see you're going far
You got responsibilities
A crazy schedule that you keep
And when you say that time's a-wasting
You don't know how right you are
Busy man
There's a woman in the bedroom crying
Saying I thought we had plans
You say honey I'm sorry I'll make it up
When the job slows down and I'm not such
A busy man
[Chorus]
Have you ever seen a headstone with these words
"If only I had spent more time at work"
There's a call one day from the office
They need you down in Birmingham
You say no way, the weekend's mine
I got plans with the kids and a date with my wife
I'm a busy man
[Chorus]<start>Red sun go down way over dirty town
Starlings are sweeping around crazy shoals
A girl is there high heeling across the square
Wind blows around in her hair and the flaqs upon the poles
Waiting in the crowd to cross at the light
She looks around to find a face she can like
Church bell clinging on trying to get a crowd for Evensong
Nobody cares to depend to depend upon the chime it plays
They're all in the station praying for trains
Congregation late again
It's getting darker all the time these flagpole days
Drunk old soldier he gives her a fright
He's crazy lion howling for a fight
Strap hanging gunshot sound
Doors slamming on the overground
Starlings are tough but the lions are made of stone
Her evening paper is horror torn
But there's hope later for Capricorns
Her lucky stars give her just enough to get her home
Then she's reading about a swing to the right
But she's thinking about a stranger in the night
I'm thinking about the lions tonight
What happened to the lions<start>Just driftwood floating on the sea
Searching for the me and all that I have known to be
Thank god that you noticed me
And brought back harmony to this lonely soul
Oh it's a revelation
I feel alive again
There are no limitations with love
The day you said that you'd be mine
I can see cloud nine
'Cause I was flying over it
I wasted so much time
Running circles in my mind
I couldn't hear my heart calling out for you
There's only one kind of love
The kind that I've been dreaming of
Don't you know it's unconditional?
And when you hold love in your hand
Only then you'll understand
It's everything that you've been wishing for
Sometimes from out of the blue
An angel comes to you
But you've got to have an open heart
I nearly failed the test of time
But now that you are mine
Girl, I'm here to stay
Oh it's a revelation
I feel alive again
There are no limitations with love
There's only one kind of love
The kind that I've been dreaming of
Don't you know it's unconditional?
And when you hold love in your hand
Only then you'll understand
It's everything that you've been wishing for
There's only one kind of love
The kind that I've been dreaming of
Don't you know it's unconditional?
And when you hold love in your hand
Only then you'll understand
It's everything that you've been wishing for<start>Let me down slow an' easy
'Cause there ain't nothin' I can do
I hope and pray, my faith won't leave me
When it comes down to me an' you
Try a little tenderness
I die a little
For a long lost sweet caress
You lyin' next to me
Fulfilled some destiny
I wanna cry
But I breathe a sigh
Just a little bit of lettin' go
I don't want you to know
I wanna cry
But I breathe a sigh
Overflow of emotion
And a hurt that'll never heal
If you close the door forever
The fate of pain is sealed
Try a little tenderness
I die a little
For a long lost sweet caress
You lyin' next to me
Fulfilled some destiny
I wanna cry
But I breathe a sigh
Just a little bit of lettin' go, yea
I don't want you to know
I wanna cry
But I breathe a sigh
I more than long for your affection
You tell me now that ain't so
Not even gentle persuasion
Is ever gonna let me go
You lyin' next to me, yea
Fulfilled some destiny
I wanna cry
But I breathe a sigh
Just a little bit of lettin' go, yea
I don't want you to know

But I've seen to much to try you
It's always weirdness while you
Dig it much too much to fry you
The weirdness flows between us
Anyone can tell to see us
Freak scene just can't believe us
Why can't it just be cool and free us?
Seen enough to eye you
But I've seen to much to try you
It's always weirdness while you
Dig it much too much to fry you

Freak scene just can't believe us
Why can't it just be cool and leave us?
It's so fucked I can't believe it
If there's a way I wish we'd see it
How could it work just can't conceive it
Oh what a mess it's just to leave it
Sometimes I don't thrill you
Sometimes I think I'll kill you
Just don't let me fuck up will you
'cause when I need a friend it's still you<start>I'll be the girl with the long blond hair
And the really pale skin, if you care
I sit in the corner of the room
Cross-legged and quiet, filled with doom, mmhm
I never ever liked the smell in here
It's cold and wet and reeks of beer
The lights are turned out permanently
But that's OK 'cause I don't want to see
Wayne
Wait for me
And take me up in your hot air balloon
And feed me cotton candy
Wayne
Pray for me
'Cause I'll be there in a couple of years
Until then, wait for me
Who's the strange lady with the big silly hair
And berries on her face, dressed like a pear
Do I really have to hold her hand
And pretend she's mommy, your wife and man
When I know you're not my mommy
It's crowded and I feel lost in here
I'm trying to find a familiar fear
I look everywhere but I just can't see
There's not anything that reminds me of me, oh
Wayne
Wait for me
Take me up in your hot air balloon
And feed me cotton candy
Wayne
Pray for me
'Cause I'll be there in a couple of years
Until then, wait for me
You made me fresh as flowers
Under these rocks and stones
Wayne
Wait for me
And take me up in your hot air balloon
And feed me cotton candy
Wayne
Pray for me

And feed me cotton candy

Pray for me
'Cause I'll be there in a couple of years
Until then, wait for me<start>People say you've been around
How about you and me get down
How about you and me get down
Baby I know you've been around
Unmake your bed
Don't think about what lies ahead
Don't you wanna be misled
Don't you wanna be misled
Fame
Seems a far-off day
When enough was never enough
Vain
How I played my hand
One more reckless man in the rough
Strange
How we explain
The story that we've lived through
Change
My karma train
The person I can be for you is
Safe
(Safe, in the heat of the moment)
A stillness that comes to me
When I'm close to you
Safe
(Safe, at the speed of atonement)
A feeling that runs so deep
That it scares me, too
Dazed
By my own escape
From the single state I was used to
Face
My catch twenty two
Can I stay this way if I choose to
Wrong
To be so contained
Now I can't explain
What is happening
Strong
Is the human chain
As it pulls me through
What I bring to you is
Safe
(Safe, in the heat of the moment)
A stillness that comes to me
When I'm close to you
Safe
(Safe, at the speed of atonement)
A feeling that runs so deep
That it scares me, too
Safe
(Safe, in the heat of the moment)
A stillness that comes to me

How I played my hand

Hook a finger wink an eye
Caresses running up your thigh
Scratch my surface dig in deep
There's always secrets left to keep
Safe not sound
Who made these rules
Crowd control for enlightened fools
So come on boy let's change the pace
Come, feel the chill of my embrace
People say you've been around
How about you and me get down
How about you and me get down
Baby I know you've been around
Unmake your bed
Don't think about what lies ahead
Don't you wanna be misled
Don't you wanna be misled

A stillness that comes to me
When I'm close to you

A feeling that runs so deep

In pots of broken truth

Poets pain, battles fame
And becomes its slave

Bring a light to your eyes though you know it's disguise
When the night turns to day you turn around and say
Magic mirror please tell is this heaven or hell?
Answer to the master
Can you look to the sky? Can you live through your lie?
Of the thoughts you can't trace which time can't erase
To a face on the wall do you often recall
What you said on the night when the new full moon was rising?
Answer to the master
When the night time unfolds and the memories that you hold
Bring a light to your eyes though you know it's disguise
When the night turns to day and you turn around and say
Magic mirror please tell is this heaven or hell?
Answer to the master
Answer to the master<start>I used to wake up at night
With this song going through my mind
Tried so hard to write is all down
But the melody was hard to find
Then one night about a week ago
I was passing a nightclub door
I heard something
that made me turn around
I had to go inside for more
It was the same feeling
a different song
Thought I'd heard it before
but it must be wrong
Same beat - Just a different groove
Whatever it I,
makes you want to move, move, move
Those people were dancing a new thing
Going crazy before my eyes
I felt the shivers come over me
Knew I had to take a run outside
I went back home and turned my radio on
the D.J. had just begun
He said this song is a mystery to me
But I know it has to be a number one
It had the same feeling
a different song
Thought I'd heard it before
but it must be wrong
Same beat - but a different groove
Whatever it is,
makes you want to move, move, move<start>It's the shiver when you're by my side
It's the beauty when our eyes colide
I've been lost
Through the bruises of the past
It's the promise that our love will last
Inside...
[Chorus]
Are you for real?
Are you for sure?
Or is it another dream?
Or is it an open door?
[Chorus]
Are you for real?
Are you for sure?
Or is it another dream?
Or is it an open door?
Isn't it funny to know...that
I've tried so hard to be unlovable
But your touch
Made me want to be the only key
That would finally dare to set you free
Inside...
[Chorus]
Are you for real?
Are you for sure?
Or is it another dream?
Or is it an open door?
[Chorus]
Are you for real?
Are you for sure?
Or is it another dream?
Or is it an open door?
...
[Chorus]
Are you for real?
Are you for sure?
Or is it another dream?
Or is it an open door?
[Chorus]
Are you for real?
Are you for sure?
Or is it another dream?
Or is it an open door?
Why don't you wake me up? (x 12)
by Diana* ='D<start>Can you feel it, see it, hear it today?
If you can't, then it doesn't matter anyway
You will never understand it cuz it happens too fast
And it feels so good, it's like walking on glass
It's so cool, it's so hip, it's alright
It's so groovy, it's outta sight
You can touch it, smell it, taste it so sweet
But it makes no difference cuz it knocks you off your feet
You want it all but you can't have it
It's cryin', bleedin', lying on the floor
So you lay down on it and you do it some more
You've got to share it, so you dare it
Then you bare it and you tear it
You want it all but you can't have it
It's in your face but you can't grab it
It's alive, afraid, a lie, a sin
It's magic, it's tragic, it's a loss, it's a win
It's dark, it's moist, it's a bitter pain
It's sad it happened and it's a shame
You want it all but you can't have it
It's in your face but you can't grab it

Yo, no se la soluciÃ³n
Mas, mas, mas aguanta un poco
Todo se terminara
Mas, mas, mas y el sacrificio
Es inÃºtil
No ver, no hablar, no oÃ­r

Just in odd moments
I wish you could see me
The truth that I am
It's always this way

I try to say something
My words they grow fainter
And you're slipping away

I was wishing for the day
When I didn't even know one word
I don't want to hurt you
Not every single time, no
I just seem to hurt you
Every single time
I wish you could be what's her name
And I could be King Kong
But the chorus was pretty much the same
Every time I wrote this song
I don't want to hurt you
Not every single time, no
I just seem to hurt you
I just seem to hurt you
Every single time
I started this lesson in depravity
Now we're falling apart in this lack of gravity
And my heart is just a muscle in a cavity
But it hurts so bad and I'm trying to say
I'm definitely blind
I don't want to hurt you
Not every single time, no
I just seem to hurt you
Every single time
I started this lesson in depravity
Now we're falling apart in this lack of gravity

I'm definitely blind

Not every single time, no

Living in his fear until the break of dawn

I hope that someday you'll reply
So I'm calling your name to the sky

The absence of the voice

Nobody hears the muted cries

Fading away, before me

And felt you close and warm beside me

I won't make it on my own, so won't you please hurry home
'Cause nothing seems to matter without you
Last time I saw you, there was nothing we could say
We knew it was a time for a change
A time to think you said that night and I lied and said, "All right"
And I left you in the morning, I watched you in the window
And Mexico will never be the same
It was time to be apart, but somehow it seems this heart of mine
Will never find a way to live without you
And now I'm out here on the road and I'm feeling bought and sold
And tonight I just can't but think about you<start>You - you can say hello to tenderness

The blackened soil in the distance
Process starts over again
Near the pyres the women weep
The tears is in the flames

For there sometimes are too....

But who is right? Where is wrong?
Can this go on? It's easier said than done.

Wherein he was the subject of an old salt into the sea.
He buys the winds and tides, neither good, bad, right or wrong
There is a storm ahead in the distance
For the stow away to take cover unless you are
On the right side of the fire
Who is right, and where is wrong
Can this go on? It is easier said than done.

Ohhh...said than done.
Oh, said than done.

Butterfly in cocoon<start>QUALCOSA CHE TI LASCI IL SEGNO (Cristina Don)
Ho sentito il cuore diventare fuoco
mentre parlavo al tuo cuore vuoto
che non mi affascina pi
ma non so chiudere ora
cos sto pensando a un finale
che ti lasci il segno
mi hai dato un abito per sedurti
nel modo migliore
che user per lasciarti, per bruciarti il cuore
sai, sto pensando a un finale
che ti lasci il segno
sai, sto pensando a un finale
che ti lasci il segno
posso stringerti e non farti male
o posso lasciarti svanire
in un dolcissimo bacio finale
che ti lasci il segno
in un dolcissimo bacio finale
che ti lasci il segno<start>I dont need anything I'll get by just fine by myself
I can take a million of us and pretend that we're the sun
I've been thinking about everything
Caught up in my selflessness
And now im seeing how much time I've wasted
Caught up in my selfishness
I guess I was there too late to catch your fall
I've grown strong enough to make my words get stuck in your head
But my weaknesses come from the answers left unsaid
I'm confused with all this tension
I thought that we were still friends (Are we still friends?)
If I asked for another chance id wonder if you would say yes
Would you say yes?
I've been thinking about everything
Caught up in my selflessness
And now im seeing how much time I've wasted
Caught up in my selfishness
I guess I was there too late to catch your fall
I dont see what you want from me, no
I dont see what you want from me
I'm pretty sure when this is over
You're gonna turn your back
If I never took my eyes off of you
Would you say yes?
Cause without this friendship we all lose
Would you say yes?
I guess I was there too late to catch your fall<start>Bells will be ringing this sad, sad New Years
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone, I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again
Choirs will be singing Silent Night
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas by New Years night
Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas, yes Christmas my dear
The time of year to be with the ones you love
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam
Christmas and New Years will find you home<start>Your self destruction has become mine
Your reflection contains nothing but vacant eyes
Those vacant eyes tell the stories, tell the stories
You forsake all loyalties for lies
You're too late to decide, this can't go right
'Cause I got this tonight, I got this tonight
I wondered how hurt you'd be
(The words we've become)
After you read this
(Were they yours or mine)
Did it even speed your heart beat
(Is that what you thought)
Or make you nervous?
(Thought that you would find)
I need say this, the best parts were hush, hush
(What you waited for tonight, tonight)
The best parts were pure luck
But I swore that this time I was more than your hook up
Those vacant eyes looking back
To see your words under my skin
And I am more than a moment
But I had to give in
A person gets just one chance
To say what they really mean
You said yours, I'll say mine
It's all wasted, so fake it at nineteen
The best years have passed you by
The best years have already passed
You forsake all loyalties for lies
You forsake all loyalties for lies
Your penny thoughts of leaving
(I can still hear the sound)
Together from this town
(We can work this out)
Convinced the boy inside me
(With the last of my strength)
To let his guard down
(I said everything)
You played me so well
(Enjoy your time left)
I didn't notice when the floor fell
(Without the blame)
From underneath my feet
I thought we were floating
Those vacant eyes looking back
To see your words under my skin
And I am more than a moment
But I had to give in
A person gets just one chance
To say what they really mean
You said yours, I'll say mine
It's all wasted, so fake it at nineteen
The best years have passed you by
The best years have already passed
Is this the world passing by
Or is it turning, turning?
This is the first time
That I have ever looked inside myself
It was the first time
That I ever looked inside myself
Now the world beneath my feet is turning, turning
Oh, this silly world keeps turning, turning away
All this time the world I knew was turning, turning
All this time that I loved you, you were turning, turning away<start>[Soundclip of LeVay percorming a Black Mass]
Last night Kali came to my room,
She had with her a message,
She brought the mantra
mantra.... mantra..... mantra....
...of doom.
...as the moon raises over the hills
I feel a blessing and a sudden chill,
I guess it's over now, time to let it go,
Yeah, its time to set free.......
...mantra..... mantra .....mantra ....mantra
of Doom.
[soundclip some asshole jankin' on bout satanism]<start>You kept all the things I threw away
A leaf I picked a birthday card I made
Holding on to memories of you and me
We didn't last a year, oh
We're just a box of souvenirs
'Cause
Maybe I pulled the panic cord
Maybe you were happy, I was bored
Maybe I wanted you to change
Maybe I'm the one to blame
This meant more to you than it did to me
I was full of doubt and you believed
The more that you keep coming over
The more I know it's over, dear
We're just a box of souvenirs
Maybe I pulled the panic cord
Maybe you were happy, I was bored
Maybe I wanted you to change
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Maybe you were just too nice to me
Maybe it took me way too long to leave
Maybe once we felt the same
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do
That's the way the story goes, oh
Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do
That's the way the story goes, oh
Maybe I pulled the panic cord
Maybe you were happy, I was bored
Maybe I wanted you to change
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Maybe you were just too nice to me
Maybe it took me way too long to leave
Maybe once we felt the same
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Maybe I'm the one to blame<start>When the sun goes down (when the sun goes down)
And the bats are back to bed (and the bats are back)
The brothers come 'round (the brothers come 'round)

Tap my pretty little feet (tap my pretty little feet)
Feeling brighter than sunlight (oh)
Louder than thunder (oh)
Bouncing like a yo-yo, whoa (oh)
Don't got no problems (no problems)
Ain't got no suitcase (no suitcase)
Ain't got no clothes to worry about (no clothes to worry about)
Ain't got no real estate or jewelry or gold mines to hang me up
I just throw in my hand (throw in my hand)
With the chilliest bunch in the land (in the land)
They don't look much (oh), they sure chilly chilly (oh)
They positively glow-glow, huh (oh)
Chilly down with the fire gang
Think small with the fire gang (It's the only way)
Bad hep with the fire gang (a smile a day keeps the doctor away)
When your thing gets wild, chilly down
Chilly down with the fire gang (Hey, I'm a wild child)
Act tall with the fire gang (whoo, walk tall)
Good times, bad food (yeah)
When your thing gets wild
Chilly down, chilly down
Drive you crazy, really lazy, eye rollin', funky strollin', ball playin'
Hip swayin', trouble makin', booty shakin', tripping, passing, jumping
Bouncing, drivin', stylin', creeping, pouncing, shoutin', screamin'

Think small with the fire gang
Bad hep with the fire gang<start>Turns out I never had a thought at all.
I've been talking in my sleep,
Reciting teleprompted anthems.
A marionette strung tight to the executives upstairs.
I almost had myself convinced that I meant everything I said.
What a shame.
Oh captain, my captain,
You've been drinking.
What happened?
I've been slurring my cadences and blacking out when I stand.
I know about your son,
Who never did return from the war.
But there was poison in that bottle,
I tell you.
I'm coming out with my hands in the air.
And the voice that you're hearing,
Isn't me.
What you are hearing isn't mine.
There's been some horrible mistake.
I'm a proud god-fearing registered democrat.
This is all some elaborate scheme and it will be cleared up
When the governor beckons for me.
He'll clear my name.
It appears that the inmates have overrun the asylum.
There's a madman at the wheel.
We are not even remotely capable of keeping our heads about us.
We've abandoned all semblance of presence.
Dead bolted, buckled in.
Keeping our word to the sinking ship.
Let the rats orchestrate the new mutiny,
I'll met you overboard.<start>Yes
Are you there?
(Is it) wonderful to know
All the ghosts
All the ghosts
Freak my selfish out
(My) mind is happy
Need to learn to let it go
I know you'd do no harm to me
(But) since you've been gone I've been lost inside
Tried and failed as we walked by the riverside
Oh I wish you could see the love in her eyes
The best friend that eluded you lost in time
Burned alive in the heat of a grieving mind
Oh what can I say now?
And it couldn't be more wrong 'cause there's no one there
Unmistakably lost and without a care
Oh lost all the love that we could have shared
And it's wearing me down
And it's turning me round
And I can't find a way now
To find it out
Where are you when I need you
Are you there?<start>Holding tightly on to something you believe
It's getting harder when we practice to deceive
But you know when right fails
I will be there
I will be there
I will be there to hold and guide you
Dark is the night that hides the light from your eyes
I will be there to hold and guide you
Come the morning life is keeping you in chains
But don't you be afraid to call out my name
I come to you in the blue rain
Let the tears fall
I will be there
I will be there
I will be there to hold and guide you
Dark is the night that hides the light from your eyes
I will be there to stand beside you
Now I can see the shadows over you
Thunder rolls but the light breaks through
And there are times in my life
I know love is true
And I need you to know
I will be there
I will be there
I will be there to hold and guide you
I won't let another night steal the light from your eyes
I will be there
I will be there
I will be there to hold adn guide you
When the dream inside you cries just lift up your eyes
I will be there...<start>i dreamed it all again

When all the things you took for granted before
Seem important now, then you know it's too cold
to be cool ... yeah you know you're too cold
Only another person going through pain can understand
The pain you're going through. You don't need a well
adjusted, sterilized computer type to analyze what's
wrong with you. When all the things you took for granted
before seem important now, then you know it's too cold
to be cool ... yeah you know you're too cold to be cool.

I'm a little bit reckless with this life
Well, I don't worry
'Cause Heaven's on my side
When you're walkin' on water
The waves, they try to knock you down
You'll beg and borrow
To go another round
Throw the cards on the table
Hit me once then hit me again
I'm not afraid 'cause I'm able to win
It's like I've never been down before
Like I've never been down
It's like I've never been down before
Like I've never been
Too afraid to risk it
Double down and bet it all
'Cause if you're ever gonna win it
You got to make the call

As long as I get to play
You'll never see me frown, no matter up or down

Throw the cards on the table
Hit me once then hit me again

For there is a difference... oh yeah
Sex satisfies lust, lust wont change you
It just lies there. yeah, yeah
You can pay someone for sex
You cant pay no one to love you
If true love can be bought...
I could never be rich enough
Ah... Leave it alone
Dont bet that Im ready to sell my soul
Ah... leave it alone...
Dont mean that Im willing to make it alone
Am I missing the point
Ah... leave it alone
Some love to lie, dont care with who
I think Im indifferent... what about you...
Two halves are whole, no one is in control
Or more the wiser... yeah, yeah
Sex without love is lust
Thats where we get confused
In love you give yourself...
Lust is just, someone gettin used...
Ah... Leave it alone...
Dont bet that Im ready to sekll my soul
Ah... Leave it alone...
Dont mean that Im willing to make it alone

It helps to ease the tracks of my mind
I thought I'd be much more some way
Did I miss the killing time?
Ooh, I look at all the times I should have walked away
Ooh, I look at all the times I should have cared
Now I'm looking out for a soul to preach to
What I'm searching for is just a world away
I fell into a foreign haze
The mirror's never shown my eyes
Caught up in a cloud for days
Ooh, I look at all the times I should have walked away
Ooh, I look at all the times I couldn't care
Now I'm looking out for a soul to preach to
What I'm searching for is just a world away
Can't you see the dead's alive?
Read the blood between the lines and I'll be there
Can't you feel me petrified? Pull me in and show reality for me
It's only just a dream
Ooh, I look at all the times I never cared
Now I'm looking out for a soul to preach to
What I'm searching for is just a world away
Now I'm looking out for a soul to preach to
What I'm searching for is just a world away<start>Wake up Jack get ready
Here we come to rock this town
Hold on tight and steady
Over under sideways down
You must feel the power
Fix your eyes upon the stage
Watch us now devour
Everything that gets in our way
[Chorus]
Your fascination with my creation
Adds stimulation rock til you drop
Hard rock nation lost generation
End the frustration get shot full of rock
Get shot full of rock get shot full of rock
Taste the hard rock candy
Guaranteed to melt in your mout
Jump back now Jim Dandy
East west north and south
[Chorus]
Catch the rush all over
Take a chance if you dare
ain't got time for posers
Look out Dick you better beware
[Chorus]
You must feel the power
Fix your eyes upon the stage
Watch us now devour
Everything that gets in our way
[Chorus]<start>Across the western world
The fights are going down
The gypsy armies of the evening
Have lit their fires across
The nether side of town
They will not pass this way again
So here in the night
Leave your home it's time for running
Out of the light
I see the hosts of Mohammed coming
The Holy Sister bars her doors against the East
Her house has stood too long divided
The uninvited guests are breaking up the feast
She may not bid them leave again
So here in the night
Leave your home it's time for running
Out of the light
I see the hosts of Mohammed coming
I dreamed I stood like this before
And I'm sure the words that I heard then
Were much the same
It's just an old Greek tragedy they're acting here
Held over by popular acclaim
So here in the night
Leave your home it's time for running
Out of the light
I see the hosts of Mohammed coming<start>He was throwing grain to the ground below, ground below
With dreary circles of his arm, going slow, very slow
His cap pulled down round his ears to
hide the smile and watery tears
My loving life is so wonderful
how small seeds gracefully to grow
into beautiful things that spring from these rows
With their musical names and musical sound
Dreary birds parade across the dreary sky, down below
the woman absent mindedly begins to sow, how she sows the
seeds her husband loved so much, but he's no longer
here with us
But her life is so beautiful
as memories continue to grow
into beautiful things that spring from these rows
With their musical names and musical sounds
Beautiful things that spring from these rows
with their musical names and musical sounds, and musical sounds
Distant tho I am
orange, gold, and green
firing, flaming, colors surround me
I'm always wondering where you are?
I'm always wondering where you are?
Darling shouldn't I be the one
wondering after all I am the one who is gone
I'm always wondering where you are
I'm always wondering where you are
Darling shouldn't I be the one
wondering after all I am the one who is gone
I'm always wondering
I'm the one, who is gone
I'm the one, who is gone
who is gone
But, there's beautiful things that spring from these rows
With their musical names, and musical sounds
there's beautiful things that spring from these rows
With their musical names, and musical sounds
and musical sounds<start>I never said anything cause I was just too proud
But now that I'm looking again, it's all I think about
See I should have told you, but I kept it all inside yeah
And I can't do everything but at least I know I tried
Oh yeah
They never mean the words they say, so take it back they'll fade away
And time will tell take it from me just stick around just take a seat
They never think before they say you twist it up some other way
It's hard to tell when you were wrong so hurry up before they're gone
See I've been avoiding cause I know how much it hurts
And I'll keep on waiting cause I know we'll make it work
And this is a different day a better kind of (kinder) sound
Before I was blinded but I see it clearly now
They never mean the words they say, so take it back they'll fade away
And time will tell take it from me just stick around just take a seat
They never think before they say you twist it up some other way
It's hard to tell when you were wrong so hurry up before they're gone
They were wrong you knew it then what you saw was not in plan
You went off don't understand now you wont give them the chance
Don't you see you're holding back they don't mean what they said then
Gotta give them back a chance or you'll both be a lone
They never mean the words they say, so take it back they'll fade away
And time will tell take it from me just stick around just take a seat
They never think before they say you twist it up some other way
It's hard to tell when you were wrong so hurry up before they're gone
Before they're gone<start>,

And you need some love and care
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon i will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you got to do is call
And I'll be there
Yes I will
You've got a friend
If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
Oh, but don't you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call

Thought I'd let you know<start>I saw you in the headlights
It's gonna be a long night
Cause suddenly those memories
Came flooding back to me
But as much as I keep trying to
I can't seem to forgive you
You know how much I loved you
You know how much I want to
Forget the way I saw you
In someone else's arms
But as much as I keep trying to
I can't seem to forgive you
Can't forgive what you did to me
I think about it constantly
It's like a thorn that's tearing at my soul
Your the one I'd love to hate
For this cruel twist of fate I can't undo
Cause I still love you
You told me you were sorry
I think you even meant it
I wish it was that easy
To ignore the awful truth
But as much as I keep trying to
I can't seem to forgive you
Can't forgive what you did to me
I think about it constantly
It's like a thorn that's tearing at my soul
Your the one I'd love to hate
For this cruel twist of fate I can't undo
Cause I still love you
Here I am alone again
I wish it never happened<start>O' christmas tree

I got a box fit for a king on Queens Street
(Tell me that's not irony)
Money can't buy happiness
Man, I think the opposite
If I had just one chance
I'd buy romance
[Chorus: ]
I want to know the things you're thinking
I want to be the place you are
Under the city lights, I'm sinking
Is anybody out there, anybody out there?
All alone in the strange city
Every other face is a blank to me
But I'm gone, gone, gone
And I'm lost in a sea of anonymity
Money can't buy happiness
Man, I think the opposite
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
I love the way the city turns
I'm yours today, I will be found
I can't stop laughing, I can't stop smiling
All the time
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Is anybody out there, anybody out there? (Repeat)<start>I've got such a mess between my ears
Like dishes in the sink
Stuff I don't believe just tumbles in
'Til I don't have room to think
All my failures are on display
The broken dreams of yesterday
The stuff I should have thrown away
But I've kept it here instead
I've gotta empty out the inside of my head
This could be a room with such a view
But it's covered up with junk
Blocking off the place the light gets through
So it keeps me in this funk
These dark clouds I've stowed away
Just in case of a sunny day
So I could stand in the pouring rain
Of every tear I've ever shed
I've gotta empty out the inside of my head
I'd like to turn this place into my home
Instead of someplace that I dread
It's the only room that's mine alone
And I'll live here till I'm dead
I'll sort through what I have found
Stuff that works I'll keep around
But I can't live weighted down
With every cruel word they said
I've gotta empty out the inside of my head<start>You Made A Fool Of Me Last Night.
Left Me Alone At The Table You Did.
Not Very Bright!
And You Made It Obvious For Sure.
Dancing And Smiling That Might Be All Right.
But You Gave Him More!
Please Let Me Tell You Something About That Guy.
He's Not As Friendly As He Seems To Be.
He Makes You Feel So Free.
But Something Else On His Mind, That's Why He's Kind.
Awkward Behaviour Like That.
Suit You It Doesn't At All.
So Jealous That You Might Fall.
Wake Up, Grow Up And See.
That You Will Never Again
Question My Love For You.
Why Can't You See?
Just How Much You Mean To Me?<start>I've got nothing to say, I've got nothing to do,
All of my neurons are functioning smoothly,
Yet still I'm a cyborg just like you,
I am one big myoma that thinks, my planet supports only me,
I've got this one big problem: Will I live forever?I've got just a short time to see,
Modern man, evolutionary betrayer,Modern man, ecosystem destroyer,
Modern man, destroy yourself in shame,Modern man, pathetic example of earth's organic heritage,
When I look back and think, when I ponder and ask myself "Why?",
I see my ancestor spend with careless abandon,
Assuming eternal supply,<start>(belew/fetters/nyswonger)
You don't retain your calm
Either you're an anvil
Or sell me your aunt
And your car is almost gone
Figure it out
My bag's against the wall
You knocked me up,
You didn't knock me out
And I'm God about to brawl
Figure it out
Talk beheads the cat
Shoes off the couch
Or I catch a rat
But I'll rent you a riot hat
Figure it out
My bulk's across the mall
A wounded ham was an animal
And I've got a bout of gall
Figure it out
My back's against the wall
Figure it out
And I'm not about to crawl
Figure it out<start>Musiche di E. Riccardi
Testo di L. Albertelli
Stretti abbracciati sul plaid sambari
Oggi divido con te quello che ho
Un misto di donna e bambina sambari
Giochiamo a fare mattina
Finch si pu
E le tue scarpe buttale via
Io la mia noia la butto via
Mettiti a sedere e parliamo un po'
Oppure no
Sento che gi non resisto sambari
Nella tua mano un transistor
Suona da un po'
Bella ti asciughi i capelli sambari
Ti tocco e non ti ribelli certo che no
Il tuo vestito buttalo via
Io la mia noia la butto via

We will see who's laughing then
Someday when push comes to shove
We will see who's laughing then
Oh jack-o-lantern man
If you could see the rage inside of me
I could cut my veins and drown you in the flames
And I'd know, I'd know
I would know ecstasy
And I was only seventeen
Stir the blood spill the seed
Psilocybin all the time
Dirty water spill the wine
The birds outside, they never stop
Shut the window call the cops
Oh jack-o-lantern man
I wanna see that smile turn cold surprise
We will see who's laughing then
When I piss in your hollow eyes
I wanna drown you like a kitten in the sink
I wanna see you bleed amethyst
Oh jack-o-lantern man
We will see who's laughing then
With a skull full of piss
And I was only seventeen
Stir the blood spill the seed
Psilocybin all the time
Dirty water spill the wine

Come on, baby, yeah
Hey baby, sure love you fine
You got a way of moving, mama
Make me lose my mind
You know, mama, what you got
Something I need, sure need a lot
I got the rhythm, and you sure got the style
So, shake it, mama, please stomp around a while
Shake on
Hey, baby, yes, you're doing fine
You're stomping so good, mama
You got the boys in the line
Foxy mama
You sure got what it takes
And when you're stomping, darling
Boy, it really shakes
Foxy woman
You don't tell no lies
What you got, darling
Sure would like to advertise
Hear the boys say
Look at that, mama, don't she look fine

Stomp around<start>I want you back again
Uh I want you back
I can't take it
That you're with someone else
Uh I want you here
I want you with me back again
Your very reason for leaving
Was that I let you go
But you know I regret it now
I wish I could make up for it
Somehow
'cause' we were meant for each other
So much love and pain we shared
I didn't mean to hurt you so bad
I want you back again
I want you back
I can't take it
When you're with someone else
I want you here
I want you with me back again
I never understood
That we' were meant to be
Until I saw you disappear
I came to realize
That you were the one for me
And that without you
I would rather die
The only reason I'm living
Is lust for loving you
L wish I could make it all come true
'cause' you are the only one for me
I don't have much hope
When I don't feel your love
You're all that I've got
I want you back again
I want you back
I'm jealous
When you're with someone else
I want you here
I want you with me
And no one else
And no one else
And no one else<start>Sunshine

What must rise, must fall
And what goes on in your life
Is writing on the wall
If all things must fall
Why build a miracle at all
If all things must pass
Even a miracle won't last
What goes up, must come down
What must stand alone?
And what goes on, in your mind
Is turning into stone
If all things must fall
Why build a miracle at all
If all things must pass
Even a pyramid won't last
How can you be so sure?
How do you know what the earth will endure?
How can you be so sure?
That the wonders you've made in you life
Will be seen
By the millions who'll follow to visit the site
Of your dream?
What goes up, must come down
What goes round, must come round
What's been lost, must be found<start>Oh, yes
Oh, yes
Come with me, I'll take you anywhere
We'll feel our way to the top of the stairs
And say hey, oh yes today
Shake your hands through the chains above
Let them fight, we'll catch a dove and
Say whatever you say
I don't mind if you dream out loud
Fix your hair, a fallout cloud
Hey, I don't mind whatever you're going through
If it were up to me, I would leave it up to you
Train the searchlights on some other lives
Forget these kids, forget these wives, 'cause
Hey, who could catch us anyway?
When the moon buries a sun in the dead sea
It's the cemetery of the century, but
Hey, it was a starry day
When it gets dark on the count of night
Find your way with a butcher knife, but
Hey, just be careful out there, watch who you run into
If it were up to me, I would leave it up to you
Come with me, I'll take you anywhere
We'll feel our way to the top of the stairs
And say, oh let's say it's okay
I don't mind if you dreamed out loud
You fixed your hair, a fallout cloud
Hey, I don't mind whatever you're going through
If it were up to me, I would leave it up
If it were up to me, I would leave it up
If it were up to me, I would leave it all up to you<start>Blood stains the ivories on my daddy's baby grand
Ain't seen the daylight since we started this band
No more, no more
No more, no more
Store-bought clothes fallin' 'part at the seams
Tea leaf-readin' gypsies fortune-tellin' my dreams
No more, no more
No more, no more
Holiday Inn, lock the door with a chain
You love 'em and you hate it but to me they're all the same
No more, no more
No more, no more
Baby I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage
Stalemate jailbait ladies can't refuse
You love 'em then you leave 'em with your sold out reviews
No more, no more
No more, no more
Sweet-talkin' bar room ladies disease
Slippin' with her lips slidin' down your knees
No more, no more
No more, no more
Me and my life a screamer bound to a wife in marriage
Baby I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage
Ladies hold the aces while my lovers call it passion
The men call it pleasure but to me it's old fashioned
Times they're a-changin' nothing ever stands still
If I don't stop changin' I'll be writin' my will
It's the same old story never get a second chance
For a dance to the top of the hill
Babe I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage<start>Come to me my baby
Come to me my love
Come to me my darling tonight
Cos I'm here tonight
On my own all night
Cos I'm here tonight
Gonna love you so right
You're the best thing in my life
You're the best thing in my life<start>Spill your drink on her dress
You see her face she's not impressed
And I think and I guess
That you've had a few too many
Go to the bathroom only to find
The door is locked and it's occupied
You spill your guts all over the place
I think you've had one to many
I think I've had one too few
I think you'll find that the room is spinning
And I think I'll have a laugh on you
Your distorted vision and your sweaty palms
Isn't helping you keep calm
Records are spinning, they don't seem to quit
Your girlfriend is screaming, she's having a fit
Broken a window, fell off your chair
The gum you were chewin' is now in your hair
You run to the back to get some fresh air
Thinking to yourself, life ain't fair
An empty bottle on the floor
You're passed out cold but you want some more
You try to speak but your mouth is numb
Too much drinking is what you're done<start>The devil's house in the shape of a chapel
You hid the knife in the core of an apple
Burn me, try to hurt me
Try to hit me when my back was turning
I saw you wait when the shadows were growing
You're talking straight
But your colors are showing
Burn me, try to hurt me
Try to get me when my head was turning
You want to rain on my survival story
You're crazy baby 'cause I've never had a doubt
I'm singin' songs about love and glory
Oh oh oh
Your gun went
BANG BANG BANG
You shot me to the ground
But you can't break me down
BANG BANG BANG
You tried to knock me out
No, you can't break me down
It's just my natural reaction
When I hit the floor
I'm the original assassin
I come up for more
You put me up so you can watch me crumble
I always knew you were some kind of trouble
Lurking, you can't hurt me
'cause I see just how your evil's working
A silver tongue with the best of intentions
But you're a child with the cruelest inventions
Burning, you're just hurtin'
I know somewhere deep in hell you're workin'
You want to rain on my survival story
You're crazy baby 'cause I never had a doubt
I'm singing songs about love and glory
Oh oh oh
Your gun went
BANG BANG BANG
You shot me to the ground
But you can't bring me down
BANG BANG BANG
You try to knock me out
No, you can't break me down
It's just my natural reaction
When I hit the floor
I'm the original assassin
I come up for more
You don't know what you started
You hit but missed the target
BANG BANG BANG
You shot me to the ground
But you can't break me down
BANG BANG BANG
You tried to knock me out
No, you can't break me down
It's just my natural reaction
When I hit the floor
I'm the original assassin
I come up for more<start>Pude acercarme pasando inadvertido
Mi cuerpo baila cuando estÃ¡ contigo
PedÃ­ un deseo para volver a verte
Si te dejas llevar tal vez me traigas suerte
PasÃ© a buscarte y se nos hizo tarde
La noche terminÃ³ perdidos por las calles
DejÃ© mis hojas secas en Buenos Aires
Y ahora puedo dar lo que no pude antes
Y voy buscando un corazÃ³n, que no me juzgue
Que no me haga sufrir
Que haga desaparecer mi miedo a descubrir
Lo loco que fui
Azul y blanco vuela por casi todas partes
Que pena que no te haya,
Que pena que no te haya conocido antes
Que pena que no te haya conocido antes
Pero que pena que no te haya conocido antes
Azul y blanco el cielo y gris, la calle
Tus ojos del color que no tenÃ­a nadie
Plazas en llamas y la noche que arde
Conozco una ciudad que no conoce nadie<start>City lights don't seem to far away
When you look into my eyes
Is it such a big surprise you're here with me tonight
The darkness falls around
But I'm holding on so tight
And now I'm holding on tonight
So is it time,
To let go.
But I said I could be the one to save your life tonight and I will fight
But I said I could be the one to save your life tonight and I will be your superman.
But now I'm flying oh so high
And now I'm falling down
I'm falling down
Would you catch me if I fell
I'm waiting for your arms to wrap around
Don't let go
But I said I could be the one to save your life tonight and I will fight
But I said I could be the one to save your life tonight and I will be your superman.
I have made so many mistakes towards you
But tonight I will break every promise I made
But I said I could be the one to save your life tonight and I will fight
But I said I could be the one to save your life tonight and I will be
But I said I could be the one to save your life tonight and I will fight
But I said I could be the one to save your life tonight and I will be your superman.<start>Lying all alone in this midnight blue
With nothing but these memories of you
Staring at these walls that are closing in
Wondering if you're ever coming back again
Now I'm just a prisoner in this big old bed
Living with the things that I should have said
Why is it always after someone's gone
That you can see where you went wrong
I couldn't see you leaving
But I can see you're gone
That note you left on my pillow
Said I was on my own
I never heard you crying
'Cause I was seldom home
I couldn't see you leaving
But I can see you're gone
I just keep wondering where you are tonight
And if someone else is holding you tight
It took you walking out the door to see
That I'm really nothing when you're not with me
I did a good job of fooling myself
Thinking that you love would stay on the shelf
But how could anybody be so blind
To have to wake up alone and find
I couldn't see you leaving
But I can see you're gone
That note you left on my pillow
Said I was on my own
I never heard you crying
'Cause I was seldom home
I couldn't see you leaving
But I can see you're gone
I couldn't see you leaving
But I can see you're gone<start>[Instrumental]<start>Lying on my back, staring up to the sky,
Thunder black clouds, I hear a distant cry.
Needle sharp start like diamonds on velvet,
And the snail trail of a shooting comet.
Everything I do - it all goes down, it all goes down,
Everything I see - it all goes down, it all goes down ..
.. it all goes down in my nocturnal journal.
Bats are flying high but, the owls don't give a hoot,
No birds singin', seems the whole world's mute.
The slightest noise, echoes through the streets,
Slumber-lands bounce, to a tiny heartbeat.
Walls of old houses, still creak after all this time,
Explanations don't contain no reason or rhyme.
The moon stays awake with ease,
Bangin' car doors are annoying me.
The rain is coming down, started to lash,
And I'm waiting for the glass to smash.<start>Cerco l'estate tutto l'anno
E all'improvviso eccola qua
Lei Ã¨ partita per le spiagge
E sono solo quassu in citta
Sento fischiare sopra i tetti
Un aeroplano che se ne va
Azzurro, il pomeriggio Ã¨ troppo azzurro
E lungo per me, mi accorgo
Di non avere piu pensieri
Senza di te, e allora
Io quasi quasi prendo il treno
E vengo, vengo da te
Il treno dei desideri
Nei miei pensieri all'incontrario va
Sembra quand'ero all'oratorio
Con tanto sole, tant' anni fa
Quelle domeniche da solo
In un cortile, a passeggiar
Ora mi annoio piu di allora
Neanche un prete per chiacchierar
Azzurro, il pomeriggio Ã¨ troppo azzurro
E lungo per me, mi accorgo
Di non avere piu risorse
Senza di te, e allora
Io quasi quasi prendo il treno
E vengo, vengo da te
Il treno dei desideri
Nei miei pensieri all'incontrario va
Cerco un po' d'Africa in giardino
Tra l'oleandro e il baobab
Come facevo da bambino
Ma qui c'Ã¨ gente, non si puo piu
Stanno innaffiando le tue rose
Non c'Ã¨ il leone, chissa dov'Ã¨
Azzurro, il pomeriggio Ã¨ troppo azzurro
E lungo per me, mi accorgo
Di non avere piu risorse
Senza di te, e allora
Io quasi quasi prendo il treno
E vengo, vengo da te
Ma il treno dei desideri
Nei miei pensieri all'incontrario va<start>Ride the subway home
Pretend that you're not home
When somebody calls you
But nobody calls you
And it's me who loves you still
And I always will
But there are tears all over town
Too many tears all over this town
There are tears all over town
Too many tears
Once there were trumpets in the air
And confetti in your hair
And I knew where I belonged
Now I'm singing you this song
And every star we held that night
We reached for it all you know we tried
But there are tears all over town
Too many tears all over this town
There are tears all over town
Too many tears
I'm scattered like newspapers all over the street
I see your face in everyone I meet
I'm avoiding the corners
I'm avoiding your name
I know that I loved you but I loved you in vain
And this city's too small for two
My melancholy friend and you
And these tears all over town
Too many tears all over this town
Tears all over town
Too many tears all over this town
Too many tears
Too many tears...<start>I'm tired, I'm restless
I've already said this
I might need a medic
I'm trapped in these mornings without you
These mornings without you, yeah
I'm more than just nervous
With walls on the surface
I know that you've heard this
I just want a morning here with you
A morning here with you, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, nowhere to run to when it gets harder
Ooh, ooh, ooh, no one can find us under the water, no no
Ooh, ooh, ooh, sharing a breath under the hurricane
Ooh, ooh, ooh, no one can find us under the water, no no
I've been thinking about leaving
Slowly sinking down
But while I'm thinking, you keep reaching
Never let me drown
You show me I'm worth it and no one is perfect
We all have a purpose and mine is to love this life with you
To love this life with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, nowhere to run to when it gets harder
Ooh, ooh, ooh, no one can find us under the water, no no
Ooh, ooh, ooh, sharing a breath under the hurricane
Ooh, ooh, ooh, no one can find us under the water, no no
Cause in this moment we become free
Two warms hearts under the cold sea
Yeah, we float on, we float on
And in this time we become one
We could find peace with nowhere to run
Yeah, just hold on, just hold on
And in the darkness there will be light
Two lost souls in a starlit night
Don't let go because it won't feel right, yeah
I hear you calling, I'm calling back now
The rain is falling under the light town
Ooh, ooh, ooh, nowhere to run to when it gets harder
Ooh, ooh, ooh, no one can find us under the water, no no
Ooh, ooh, ooh, nowhere to run to when it gets harder
Ooh, ooh, ooh, no one can find us under the water, no no
Ooh, ooh, ooh, sharing a breath under the hurricane
Ooh, ooh, ooh, no one can find us under the water, no no
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, no one can find us under the water, no no<start>To your way of thinking a promise is easy to make
Cause to your kind of promise is nothing but something to break
And the laugh fits your lips honey like a hand fits the glove
And your kind of woman don't understand my kind of love
The heartaches you caused me don't cause you the least bit of shame
And I guess if I let you you'd hurt me all over again
And I can't help but wonder what was I thinking of
To think that your kind of woman could understand my kind of love
I made you my life while you made me into your fool
Yes I found that too late that your love meant heartache
Your kind of woman never could be true
But someday you'll know what a hurt when your heart breaks in two
And when your world falls to the pieces then you'll know what you put me through
And I hope I'm around when you'll learn what I'm speaking of
Cause your kind of woman don't understand my kind of love<start>I'll be the one
Who'll stand in the side
When your back's against the wall
I'll be the one
Who always will love you
I'll be the one
Who won't let you fall
Just reach out for me
And I'll give you my hand
I won't turn you away
I'll understand
I'll be the one
The one you can run to
I'll be the one
Who's always standing next to you
I'll be the one
When there's no one to turn to
I'll be the one
The one you can run to
I'll be the one
Who's always standing next to you
I'll be the one
When there's no one to turn to
I'll be the one
Who's always standing next to you
I'll be the one ...<start>Somebody's at the front door, I can hear 'em knockin'
Your mama's on the phone and she feels like talkin'
There's chicken in the barbecue, barbecuein'
Don't worry bout it baby, just drop what you're doing
'Cause they're playin' our song on the radio
Okay mister D.J. and away to go
A million watts of love power comin' on strong
Dance with me darlin', they're playin' our song
Oh, the house needs cleanin', the grass needs mowin'
We both got places that we need to be goin'
Tomorrow's a big day, better get ready
But tonight it's just you and me, rockin' steady

Okay Mister D.J. and away to go
A million watts of love power comin' on strong
Dance with me darlin', they're playin' our song<start>Oh fare thee well my own true love
Fare thee well but for a while
The ship is waitin' an' the wind blows high
An' I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann
(I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann)
Ten thousand miles away from home
Ten thousand miles or more
The sea may freeze an' the earth may burn
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann
(Never no more return to you, Mary Ann)
Oh don't you see that crow fly high
She'll surely turn to white
If ever I prove false to you
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann
(Day will turn to night, my dear Mary Ann)
Oh, if I had a flask of gin an' sugar here for two
An' a great big bowl for to mix it in
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann

Yes I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann

(Mary Ann)
(Mary Ann)<start>Once upon a time, you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud, now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal
How does it feel, how does it feel
To be on your own with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone
You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
Don't you know you only used to get juiced in it?
Nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
Now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say,"Do you want to make a deal?"
How does it feel, how does it feel
To be without a home, with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone
You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns
When they all came down and did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You should never let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at?
After he's taken everything he could steal
How does it feel, how does it feel
To be without a home, with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
Drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts and things
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, and you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel, how does it feel
To be without a home, with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone<start>I stood stone-like at midnight, suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and come out with my soul untouched
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd, but when they said, "Sit down," I stood up
Ooh...growin' up
The flag of piracy flew from my mast, my sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate, she couldn't sail but she sure could sing
I pushed b-52 and bombed them with the blues with my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school, never once gave thought to landing
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd, but when they said, "Come down," I threw up
Ooh...growin' up
I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere, and you know it's really hard to hold your breath
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared, I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well, my feet they finally took root in the earth, but I got me a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car
I hid in the mother breast of the crowd, but when they said, "Pull down," I pulled up
Ooh...growin' up
Ooh...growin' up<start>In Arcady, your life trips along
It's pure and simple as the shepherd's song
Seraphic pipes along the way in Arcady
In Arcady
Never saw I such a scene
Such maids upon such a molten green
They employ their holiday with dance and game
And things I may never name
In Arcady
You said he was your teacher
Taught you so true and so wise
But now you know more than your teacher
I see nothing but cool self-regard in your eyes
In Arcady
So you see how twisted it becomes
See how quickly twisted it becomes
When the cat gut binds my ankles to your bedstead
That ain't love, no that ain't love
Said he was your teacher
Taught you so true and so wise
Now you know more than your teacher
I see nothing but cool self-regard in your eyes<start>Come, let's talk just you and me
For once just let me be.
The little boy you used to know.
Relive that summer's bliss.
Cause they came no more like this.
Those were the days,
The days when love was still in style.
[Chorus]
All I ever dreamed I'd be
Is what you are to me.
Bigger than Elvis.
And for all the missing years,
A memory reappears.
Bigger than Elvis.
I saw you on TV.
The king, you were to me.
Could you feel me watching you?
At times my heart got mad,
Only heroes are allowed
To run free, that they could come back inside of me.
[Chorus]
We know the sadness of goodbyes
Must be the one that's bringing tears to your child's eyes.
Oh, from now on I'll walk with you
Making music like you do.
Would you believe I always knew?
You were never hard to take
In some mysterious way
Bigger than Elvis
And for all the missing years
Your memory reappears
Bigger than Elvis.
Now I've found the missing years,
Forgotten all my tears.
I've found the missing years.<start>Come around when you're feeling low
When you're down you can be sure
That I am the one place you can go
It's been a long long time
And you haven't made up your mind
It's been a long long day
And there isn't enough to say
It's been a long long night
And there isn't an end in sight
Oh
but that's alright.
Make a call when you want to know
After all
you should be sure
That I am the one place you can go.
It's been a long long road
And we've still got a way to go
It's been a long long song
But we're gonna try rambling on
Baby
baby
such a long long night
And there isn't an end in sight
Oh
but that's alright.
I'm heading back to where I've been
But there's a change
I can't get used to being free with you
It's strange
It's been a long (such a) long while
Now I see you smile
Nothing left to do but to let it rain

Volevo fare una poesia
Che non parlasse che di te
Con un pennello sopra I muri scritto avrei
Che cosa sei per me.
Volevo dire per la strada
Alla gente che non ride mai
Che sei diversa, che sei vera
E che col tempo tu non cambierai,
Ma tu non sei con me.

Amore, amore, amore, amore, amore, amore no, (amore no)

Volevo una fotografia
Dove si vede che sei tu
E tappezzare tutti I muri in ogni via
Per dire a tutti che eri mia.
Ma ho solamente una canzone
Fatta di notte in un portone
Mentre ti ho vista come un ladro andare via
Con lui da casa mia
E tu non sei piu' mia.

Word up it's the nasal on the scene one mo' time!
With my man kirk gowdy on the mix
And my man funky owl in the mix
And my man frank nitti on the mix
While the chubbster in the mix, i'ma kick it like, thissssss
Check it out
Verse one: mc nasal (chubb rock)
Don't drink the milk cause it's spoiled form the racists
If you look up all the judicial cases
You see the niggaz yo, dead in the woodwork
Cause of these kkk jerks
And I'm vexed, real vexed, let me tell y'all
While I kick it from the cellular
Well I'm the nasal on the scene and fuck it
I hate cream in my coffee, so take your fuckin redneck off me
Concerning that mississippi, stop that fuckin burning
While I'm over here chillin, ready steady learning
Every racist summer, kill a large number
Of you son of bitch, who switch to archie bunker
Ignorant, accurate, coagulate, you imagine it
Hate the nigga boy, and stabbing it
All over, the odor makes you wish he was down with the force
So you can mess around like yoda
But no-no, and also, you knew so, the nigga grew so
Advances like caruso... robinson, jackie, smooth and jazzy has he
Been respected, for the past three
Decades finds his baseball cards
Niggaz have them then discard, and I'm vexed
Should I flex my pecks on the set?
And watch those bill cosby niggaz just plex?
And his kids buy a white school kit, ana
And you know he talks, bullshit, ana
Throw your hands in the air
And look at that nappiness of your hair
And if you're proud of your peas, nigga say please
And niggaz out there say yeahhh!
*crickets chirping*
I guess there no niggaz out there
Here comes the chorus for the year
Because, the nasal... will eat shrimp and basil
Remaining head to toe on the foes
And he says he will
Flip on the brothers if they don't pump their fists and
Get busy, yell and scream like this
Chorus:
Don't drink the milk! (why? ) it's spoiled
Don't drink the milk! (why? ) it's spoiled
Don't drink the milk! (but why? ) it's spoiled
(hey daddy tell him why) the milk is spoiled!!
Verse two: kirk gowdy
Every night (night), youth get tested (ested)
Mr. establishment himself is well rested (ested)
Miss sectretary, holds his message (message)
I would not make it selling drugs in texas (texas)
Which way would you look, or was you lookin? (lookin)
Every day, a nigga life is being tooken (tooken)
Vietnam, synonym brooklyn (brooklyn)
If ain't a nigga, it's a pussy I'm juckin (juckin)
Alex haley, rasta roots soil (soil)
The beginning, and it's over (over)
It wouldn't make sense if things wasn't so tense (tense)
Snatching purses, jumpin over fence (fence)
It seems so negative (egative)
They even got you robbin your own relatives (relatives)
Daily adventure, extravaganza (ganza)
No time to watch an episode of casablanca
Bonanza, highway to heaven
Stray bullet, down goes a kid, who was eleven
Community sucks (sucks), no such unity
Kids die before they reach puberty stages (stages)
Look at the ages (ages), the parent wages (wages)
The reason was in school they never turned pages (pages)
You get vexed (vexed), and temperature boils
It must be the brat and not the milk that's spoiled (spoiled)
Chorus:
Don't drink the milk! (why? ) it's spoiled
Don't drink the milk! (why? ) it's spoiled
Don't drink the milk! (will you tell me why...) it's spoiled
(yo punk tell him why...) the milk is spoiled!!
Verse three: poke
Well I'm the spanky of the crew and I'll alfalfa you
And if you step to the poke I kick nothing but jokes
One of the masterz of the trak, stick it groovy
Man I got more fuckin juice than the movie
Lights cameras actions, I'm on a fuckin mission
Hissin, white boy fishin
Z-28, camaro, buick regal
The will of these automobiles don't appeal to
The better half, and don't interview my staff
For four hundred years you stole, sold my craft
Now my ignorant dome is hard boiled
I won't drink the motherfucking mic, I mean the milk
It's spoiled!!<start>Who is the clown?
Who is the fool?
Which one knows he is playing
and which one is last in the game?
I can hear the voice, why can't they?
I am glad I wasn't born into your world.
It would be sad to be born into a world
that does not believe in love anymore.
I am not wrong!
They say they understand me
But I can't stand to be understood.
I like for people to like me
But they can never understand why I don't belong to anyone.
Who am I?
I am all of you.
I belong to everyone, because I belong to no one.
In my world there is no time.
Time is being born and dying.
Beyond time is living without being afraid
Without trying to catch something
Or run away from something.
You can't get away from alone.
You have to be alone before you can find other people.
You can't hold onto life
You can only touch it.
How old is forever?
When is too old to hope?
You're tired and I'm not.
You live against time
And I have time to live.
In my world, nothing has always been
So nothing will always be.
In my world we can still believe in hope.
If you believe in forever
You build a wall around the now.
What is, is always changing
If it isn't, then we are dying.
I live in an ocean of time
Where the past is lost in the future.
There is time for everything
There is time to love, to hope, to change.
(Nobody knows me now)<start>It's a beach party Vietnam
Surfin' with the Viet Cong
Cookin' hot dogs with napalm
A beach party Vietnam
Frankie and Annette were layin' on the sand
When Frank got a letter from his Uncle Sam
It said, "Get Moon Dog and all your friends
You're all invited to a"
Beach party Vietnam
Surfin' with the Viet Cong
Cookin' hot dogs with napalm
A beach party Vietnam
Hey Frankie, aren't you gonna give me your class ring?
Oh I'm afraid I can't do that, Annette
Why not?
'Cause I don't have any arms
Beach party Vietnam
Surfin' with the Viet Cong
Cookin' hot dogs with napalm
A beach party Vietnam
Annette, she wants Frankie's ring
Frankie wants Annette's thing
They're layin' on the West Coast
There's gonna be a wiener roast
The beach party Vietnam
Surfin' with the Viet Cong
Cookin' hot dogs with napalm
A beach party Vietnam<start>You showed me my tomorrow
Beside a box of matches
A welcome threatening stir
My hopes of being stolen
Might just ring true
Depends who you prefer
But if it's true you're gonna run away
Tell me where
I'll meet you there
Am I snapping the excitement
If I pack away the laguther
And tell you how it feels
And does burden come to meet ya
If I've questions of the feature that runs on your dream wheel
The day after you stole my heart,
Everything I touched told me it would be better shared with you
And you're hiding in my soup
And the book reveals your face
And there's a splashing in my eyelids
The concentration continually breaks
I did request the mark you cast
Didn't heal as fast
I hear your voice in silences
Will the teasing of the fire be followed by the thud?
And the jostling crowd
You're not allowed to tell the truth
And the photo booth's a liar
And the sharpened explanations
But there's no screaming reason to inquire
I'd like to poke them in their prying eyes
With things they never see if it smacks in their temples<start>Oh, little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in they dark streets shine
In everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all
The years are met in thee tonight
How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of all his heavens
No ear may hear his coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls
Will receive him still
The dear Christ enters in
Amen<start>I don't ever wanna wake up feeling like a tourist
I don't ever wanna wake up feeling like a tourist, baby, baby
I don't ever wanna wake up feeling like a tourist, baby, baby

You've got no breathing room
You got a wasted life

You need a backbone, to roll with the world
You gotta get you one to run with the bulls

You put a house of cards, on a hill of sand
Get up,
Get off the floor
I said get up,
Do something more,
You need a backbone, to roll with the world
You gotta get you one to run with the bulls

Skeleton made of straw
Images on the wall
Keeping you in the dark
You're in a pack of wolves
Trying to live alone
If you're gonna be a mole
Crawl back inside your hole<start>It's time to leave this burning ship behind
It's time to come to terms and realise
There's nothing to be found in that left behind
But reddish traces of forgotten crimes
And I fear the rage will grow above my head
When oil gets spilled, the fire fed
The precious bounds of forgiveness almost met
Indeed I'm better off remembering instead
Every day I diagnose myself and I see more of what I hate
This can't be happening
Oh, cruel twist of fate
YOUR EQUAL, YOUR SEQUEL
(a copy of a copy)
PLEASE TELL ME I'M NOT [4x]
[chorus]
I'm looking at a face I don't believe this can't be my legacy
SAY I'M NOT LIKE YOU, SWEAR I WON'T END UP LIKE THIS
What remains is courteousy and all the rest is history
SAY I'M NOT LIKE YOU, SWEAR I WON'T END UP LIKE THIS
What's mine remains the bond between our lives
I see you in the mirror with my eyes
The spitting image of that worthless life
The shiny happy family a mere disguise
And yet I vow to myself I'll change
The detriment done I'll re-erase
No more will I be marked as what you made
Now all that's left is to face that I'm afraid
Every day I diagnose myself and I see more of what I hate
This can't be happening
Oh, cruel twist of fate
Slip into your skin
Weed out the rot
And reap the right that lies within
Not repeat the mistake
And hate myself
But learn to accept my fate instead

'Cause you're digging yourself a hole

When you've got a no good, mean old
Lowdown lover man
Oh child, love just works that way
How can I sit there and watch him as he walks away?
You've got to let go, I know, just be strong
For how long? Just try
I'm gonna let go off my baby
Because he never gives me the time of day
Sometimes you've got to be alone for a while
Until a better thing comes your way
So just smile at the simple things
And forget about your trials

I remember...<start>You've cut it down, down to the bone
You begin to spite yourself and all that still surrounds
You've been deceived now by what you've sold
Truth gave way to consequence and left you all, left you all alone
Well, I lost the feeling in my heart tonight
When I was holding you I think, I died
Your touch, your kiss, it's killing me so slowly I think
I lost the feeling in my heart tonight
These streets seem empty, not a ghost in sight
You walk alone now while you become one with night
Black cold and heartless, you'll reap what you sow
Truth gave way to consequence and left you all, left you all alone
Well, I lost the feeling in my heart tonight
When I was holding you I think, I died
Your touch, your kiss, it's killing me so slowly I think
I lost the feeling in my heart tonight
But this ghost, but this town has been turned upside down
I don't want to believe but this ghost is all I see
But this ghost, but this town has been turned upside down

I was led on I suppose
For the Gypsy was always out of reach
I crossed her palm with silver just to know
What the future had to hold
But she only turned her back on me
The Gypsy said no man could make her stay
I followed anyway
Living only day to day
I left the rose as quiet as the night
Whatever she felt then, she kept inside
Ah, the years they seemed to change my Gypsy's soul
She grew weary of the road
Looking round for a better way to live
She traded in her caravan for gold
Pretty things to have and hold
Always wanting more than I could give
Came the day I just had to go
She screamed I should have known
But I never thought Id fall
I said You're the one who had the crystal ball
Perhaps you never saw me there at all
Torn between the Gypsy and the Rose
It was Romany I chose
I was only caught up in a dream
If you see someone wearing Gypsy clothes
Be wary of the pose
For she may not be all that she seems
The Rose moved on, she left here long ago
For where, nobody knows
Just to find another life
I think about her sometimes in the night
I never knew the red rose from the white
Torn between the Gypsy and the Rose
I was torn between the Gypsy and the Rose<start>"Easy Answers"
16 kid and just in the scene
But you've learned you have to play their games
Sold out through the chemical route because its easier to pass the blame
Instead of listening they pawn it off on someone else
To try their hands at easy answers
Take these push the buttons and tweak
Manufacturing a new disease
Lump sums making zeros and ones
As your forced into dependency
Instead of listening they pawn it off on someone else
To try their hands at easy answers
Giving up and taking it back to

And you can't get out of bed

Y ahora estoy en el vacÃ­o
EnredÃ¡ndome en los vicios
Pa olvidarme de tu amor
Entregas todo lo que nunca diste
Y aunque si me puse triste
Hoy entiendo que perderte
Para mÃ­ fue lo mejor
Deveras que me duele verte haciendo
Como si no pasa nada
Que lo besas en mi cara
Mira como lo disfrutas
De dejarme como un tonto
Tienes toda la intenciÃ³n
Espero que no seas su pasatiempo
Que te sobren los momentos
Que sepa llenarte de besos
Todito tu cuerpo como lo hice yo
Entiendo que yo aquÃ­ salgo sobrando
Y si me miras tomando
Ya puedes decirle a la gente
Que fui tu juguete
Y que si ando perdido
TÃº eres la razÃ³n
Espero que no seas su pasatiempo
Que te sobren los momentos
Que sepa llenarte de besos
Todito tu cuerpo como lo hice yo
Entiendo que yo aquÃ­ salgo sobrando
Y si me miras tomando
Ya puedes decirle a la gente
Que fui tu juguete
Y que si ando perdido
TÃº eres la razÃ³n<start>Remember when I said
The next time would be the last time
That time came this mornin'
When you came in
You always had a line
To change my mind
So I guess you thought
I'd just let you break my heart again
I don't want to stop lovin' you?but I will
I don't like wakin' up alone?but I will
You're the only one
Who can make my heart stand still
I don't want to let you go?but I will
I could write a book
On the innocent looks you're giving me
You've got one for every story you tell
I've seen it all and I'm not gonna fall
For those make believe tears
So, darlin' I will try to make it clear
I don't want to stop lovin' you?but I will
I don't like wakin' up alone?but I will
You're the only one
Who can make my heart stand still
I don't want to let you go but I will
You're the only one who
Can make my heart stand still
I don't want to let you go?but I will<start>Now the ghouls are back on the streets,
Capturing new victims and starting to feast,
The lost souls haunted eyes show shame and guilt,
Soon fresh blood is set to spill,
Dressed in disguise,
They offer their friendship and trust,
But what they really want,
Is to suck you dry in lust,
Have your spirits,
Disappearing in vain,
Your shadow fading away,
In emotional pain,
Your heart is being torn apart,
When you try to dig yourself,
Out of the dark,
You fear of losing your rests in pain,
But take a chance to see what you have to gain,
Don't think that this is your destiny,
Living under the spell of a charming enemy,
You fear of losing your rests in pain,
But take a chance to see what you have to gain,
Don't let your mind make you a shadow,
To have your heart and soul - fade away.<start>Although you think me cold and slimy
I've got a nice home
Tasted your best guacamole
And siesta'd at noon in the cool of the soil
A worm's life can be easy
If you lay low, out of sight
Sometimes it's too hot for cooking
One wants just a salad
And then comes a breeze in the evening
Men light cigars and their scent fills the air
A worm's life can be easy
If you lay low, out of sight
But then the rains come and the ground fills with water
And I must come up to the surface for air
Then I was plucked from the wet slime
And dropped in tequila
I lay in a stupor for sometime
And one fine night I was gulped down in a shot
A worm's life can be easy
If you lay low, out of sight<start>Mother Mary had a son
Who's days were spent on having fun
Then one day she got a letter
You could make yourself feel better
Mother Mary had a man who heals with healing hands
Millions of boys play dead
Mother Mary baby
You're flipped out to over influence
One day you will see it
You will make yourself feel better
Mother Mary had a man who heals with healing hands
Millions of boys play dead
Go go golden boys
You've got you're war toys looking straight ahead
And with your eyes so blue I will remember you
One for me and one for you
Go go golden boys go go golden boys
Turning water into wine
Go go golden boys go go golden boys
Golden many guys could ask for any time<start>- , , .

until I get the judging done,
It's only fair, I find out where,
You claim your from, why you left there,
Some sketch of you, is coming through,
Just make sure you are still, don't move anything,
Now we'll see just how well you're put together,
And what you're missing
The pieces fit because I pushed them through,
There's no more mystery, I know all about you
The pieces fit the way I want them to,
So don't go changing, don't give me work to do!
The third dimension's fine, most of the time,
But I never thought along those lines,
So I won't try to identify more than just a single side,
As it fades, a brand new(?
) strategy, and it hurts me to think much faster,
It's never clear to me!
The pieces fit because I pushed them through,
There's no more mystery, I know all about you
The pieces fit the way I want them to,
So don't go changing, don't give me work to do!
Now we'll see how you're put together,
And what you're missing,
There are issues with your fearlessness,
And there's no need for evidence,
We've got everything we need right here
The pieces fit because I pushed them through,
There's no more mystery, I know all about you
The pieces fit the way I want them to,
So don't go changing,
The pieces fit because I pushed them through,
There's no more mystery, I know all about you
The pieces fit the way I want them to,
So don't go changing...
So don't go changing, don't give me work to do!<start>I'm a girl with the best intentions
Something I should probably mention
I like to get just what I paid for
So I pay and I get and I pay and I want some more
More, More
And I want something that I want
Something that I tell myself I need
Something that I want
I need everything I see
I'm a girl who's got a notion
I'm gonna show you my magic potion
I can shop 'til I drop right to the floor
And I get right up and I want some more
More, More
And I want something that I want
Something that I tell myself I need
Something that I want

Spinnin' around in a busby swirl
With all that razzle-dazzle
I know at heart you want a down-home girl
Aw, ya know I want to take you to the spaceship races
Watch 'em do a few laps around the sun
But if you don't go in for far-off places
I'll take you home with me
When the day is done
Baby, you're so scattered
Your span of attention is shrinkin' fast
Your brain's been battered
By all the disappointments of the recent past
Aw, ya know I want to take you to the spaceship races
Watch 'em do a few laps around the sun
But if you don't go in for far-off places
I'll take you home with me
Didn't I see you walkin' on Main Street
Lookin' in the windows
Waitin' by turnstiles
Thinking of things you thought you'd like to buy
Living off dreams stored up in film cans
Looking at screens just waiting your turn while
You looked up and saw a rocket in the sky
Aw, ya know I want to take you to the spaceship races
Watch 'em do a few laps around the sun
But if you don't go in for far-off places
I'll take you home with me
When the day is done
When the day is done<start>When you cry
Try not to smile
You could fill up a lake
With the tears of a crocodile
We were too young
To be eating crow
As if I would know
(I'm scared)
Eleven hours till the electric arcs
(I'm scared)
Send scorches through the sky
(I'm scared)
Than the whole earth opens wide
And I cannot wait for the earthquake
That buries us in a warm grave
The one-legged race, on our last leg
The will is yours, so just take it
The will is yours
The will is yours
I'd rather find Jesus outside of a book
The same thing goes for Robin Hood
Never darken my door again
If opportunity knocks, let's make him beg
Let's make him beg
Yeah, where did you go?
I promise I will kill you right now
Oh, where did you go?
Bring a match while you feather your nest
Yeah, where did you go?
I promise I will kill you right now
I promise I will kill you right now
You could fill up a lake
With the tears of a crocodile
You lead by the nose and always get lost
(I cannot wait for the earthquake)
We always get lost
(to bury me in a cold grave)
Get outta this town
Hatchet men yelling timber
Will get us chopped down
Get outta this hell
Off this rusted train track
You still take lying down
So swing us around
While you're armed to the tooth
Keep yourself in the dark
Of some deep cobalt blue
So swing us around
By the skin of your teeth
Writing us off in invisible ink
So swing us around
While you're armed to the tooth
Keep yourself in the dark
Of some deep cobalt blue
So swing us around
By the skin of your teeth
Writing us off in invisible ink
You can still find me
Between devils and deep blue seas
In the desert's hands
On a sheet of sand
A dry tidal wave
Over my feet of clay
On unfinished glass
Looking for greener grass
Trying to make the welkin ring
But all my sounds are boomerangs
Yeah, where did you go?
I promise I will kill you right now
Oh, where did you go?
Bring a match while you feather your nest
Yeah, where did you go?
I promise you I will kill you right now

The blazing light, not a big deal
I wanna make you happy, I don't think i will
I want you to come over, I miss you too
Molly's eyes are blue
I see you, in slow-mo
Draped in turquoise, head to toe
I want you to come over, I miss you too
Molly's eyes are blue
Molly's eyes are blue
Chorus:
What is wrong?
It's been so looooooooooong
I'm the clown when you break down
Panamanian girl
Verse 2:
It's so hard to make this work
I'm the jerk, but i still care
I want you to know that i'm jealous of things that aren't even there
So look at me, Panamanian girl, about to cry
I can tell, what i found
Your eyes are brown
and i don't wanna drown in you
So tell me what is wrong?
It's been so loooooooooooong

To the floor
Of our apartment
A little while later
We are laughing
At our carpet burns
I like the way
That it glows outside
As the room gets darker
How I wish we could
Stay like this
While the rest of the world turns
There has never been a time
When I didn't want to be your boyfriend
There has never been a time
When I didn't want to know your name
Free falling from a work in progress
Free falling from a life on hold
There has never been a time
When I didn't want you

My good lover
Is my one good thing these days
You help me keep it all
From slipping away
I swear I'm gonna marry you someday
(Someday)
I am all alone
And it seems like
All I do is wait
Yes, we spend hours on the phone
But it's never the same
No, nothing good ever does easy
Nothing good ever comes without a fight
I am all alone
And I wish I was home
With you tonight
[Chorus]
Yeah, my girlfriend is like
Magic in the hand
When I lose my sparkle
She's the only one
That understands
I know I'm going to marry you someday [Repeat x2]
Yeah, I swear I'm going to marry you someday
Yeah yeah, I swear I'm going to marry you
Someday [Repeat x3]<start>Let down through the breakthrough
I travel as I hunger for the darkness below me
When I'm praying for the light above
To save this soul inside me
Should I? Would I? Could I?
Outcast from my own kind never knowing
Soaring through my own mind never knowing
How could they live with what their doing
Twist of my spine
Oh god fuck
I don't get it
Breathe with me
Just breathe with me
It's up to me as I hunger
Lay slow and still as I wonder
Pray for darkness down in this hollow
But I try to grope
It's up to me as I sleep again
My body lays down as I holler
It's all inside but I confess in me
I like me<start>Indonesia ...

Into a dreamland
Voyage to somewhere
All inside of a thought
In the center of midnight
In between a black hole
There's a dark orange panel
From which we take control
Watch the full colored sunset
Without need for remark
And then into the hallway
And then into the dark
Welcome to the moving room
See through the picture to the horizon
Into the landscape
Take any chance
So roll up the windows
And consider the season
Then consider the movement
In the tune of this song
You know you can't if you want to
You know you can't if you want to
You know you can't if you want to
If you want to
If you want to
If you want to
If you want to
If you want to
Welcome to the moving room
Fly down the highway
Into a dreamland
Voyage to somewhere
All inside of a thought<start>These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Someday you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn to be
Brothers in arms
Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms
There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones
Now the sun's gone to hell and
The moon's riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We are fools to make war
On our brothers in arms<start>Do you understand just how much I feel for you, do you
Do you comprehend when I say my love is true, do you
Always - with me - forever, oh baby
I know - we'll be - together
I tell you time after time, you bring me up when I'm down
I'm telling you time after time, I don't want to lose what I've found
Real love, I still believe in love
Real love, I still believe in love
Do you realize just how much you mean to me
If I close my eyes you're the only one I see
Always - with me - forever, oh baby
I know - we'll be - together
I tell you time after time, you bring me up when I'm down
I'm telling you time after time, I don't want to lose what I've found
Real love, I still believe in love
Real love, I still believe in love
Time after time, time after time
Real love, I still believe in love
And time after time, time after time
Real love, I still believe in love<start>Once again I start to wonder
Sailing thoughts on endless sea
Might be you I see reflected, from afar
Could be just my fantasy
All my love, and emotion
Life is nothing without you
Like a drop finds the ocean
I'm gonna find my way to you
Low thunder rollin'
Take me away, away
There's something callin'
Askin' me to play
Firedance, it's a firedance
Firedance, just a firedance, oh yeah
I'm the wind against the mountains
I'm the fire deep inside
I feel the magic, the rhythm is my soul
I no longer have to hide
Join me now, come on over
There's a place right here for you
Seize the moment and discover
All the things you always knew<start>Shove me under you again
I can't wait for this to end
Sober, empty in the head
I know I can never win
Why should I have to wait
I'll just look the other way
[Chorus]
We left this land of shiny lights
I wish I may, I wish I might
When all these dreams have come to end
You wish you were, you're not my friend
I can see you suffocate
I can find no other way
Try to make you saturate
I can be your enemy
Why should I have to wait
I'll just look the other way
[Chorus]
Whoa no
[Chorus]
You said you'd love
To see the end
The long hard road
That I have been
When all these dreams have come to end
You wish you were, you're not my friend
Blind eyes shine bright<start>Swallow me as I become
A living blaspheme
Force fed by your tyrant
Choke on the lies of the ancients
So you are the demon to design my fate
Disguise yourself as
An angel of god in his revolution
Spread your disease
Vesseled body
You've consecrated yourself
A missionary, now pray for me
To burn in the inferno of hell
Force fed by your tyrant
Choke on the lies of the ancients
So you are the demon to design my fate
Don't pray for me bitch
Don't pray for me Elise
The spoken word is that of the one who thinks
And how you think that you know me
Swallow me as I become a living blaspheme
Call his name in silent screams
Dethroned by a blackened sky
And even heaven has a black day
Show me the way to light
And truth as your almighty fucks you
Into unconsciousness
Five more angels fall from heaven

His piggy hands were itching for a little piggy bet
So he bought up all the houses and shops under the sun
Then lived off all the money that he screwed off everyone
Put money in your pocket, prove that you're the best
And with money in your pocket you can fuck the fucking rest
Piggy made a friend he found in little Granny Grunt
He did everything sh wanted that ruthless little cunt
So he stole her house before she died, in the ground she lay
She didn't need the cash where she was going anyway
His little piggy eyes were watching for all had turned to gold
And if you didn't pay the Pig then you were left out in the cold
But Piggy he got fatter and then ran out of luck
Poor Piggy died of a heart attack and no-one gave a fuck<start>you became my ghost

the one I want I wish I always had
had you known what I know

had you known what I know
I know the unforgettable
all that I ever want
all that I ever dreamed
what I couldn't say it pushed you away
when I had you in front of me
all that I ever want
was nothing I ever showed
I traded fear for the unforgettable

I know the unforgettable<start>Her skin is salty sweet, she wore sandals on her feet
Side by side we fell asleep in her mother's bed
She stepped inside of me, she said don't ever lie to me
This heart of mine can be yours
Yea that's what she said
But I just played the role, broke the heart I stole
Cause I was young and dumb and fucked up in the head
[Chorus ]
Do you want to be loved for real, do you want to be loved for real
Do you want to be...loved, (Yes, I want to be loved for real)
For real, (Do you want to be in love for real)
(Yes, I want to be in love for real)
Now, I'm down by the river, taking off my shoes
Jump in the water, wash away these blues
Now out into the ocean, the current takes hold
Words already been spoken, tales already been told
Heart's already been broken, wounds already been healed
Do you wannabe loved, do you want to
Do you wannabe love for real.
[Chorus (2x)]
Her eyes were hazel brown, she laughed the sweetest sound
And I just loved the way she lit up when she spoke
She help to ease my pain, she stayed through pouring rain
And I gave her all that she could take till she broke
She fit me like a glove, she taught me how to love
And for some ass I watched it all go up in smoke Chorus (4x)<start>I got a couple addictions
But I swear that I'm coming clean
I got a new way of thinking
Yeah, you're bringing out the best in me
I got a bit of a history
But she's telling me that she don't care
I've been a bit of a mystery
The only thing that I could find around tonight was you
So come on, come on, you want to
Shut your eyes and feel the chemicals collide
You and I tonight, you're the sugar in my high
Shut your eyes, I feel the chemicals collide
Stars and satellites spinning round and round
On the night you saved my life
I got a couple of problems
A thousand puzzles running through my head
But I think that you could solve them
You're always just one step ahead
I've had a couple of heartbreaks
But you're telling me that it's all right
'Cause all the others were mistakes
Yeah, I think this time I finally got it right with you
So come on, come on, you want to
Shut your eyes and feel the chemicals collide
You and I tonight, you're the sugar in my high
Shut your eyes, I feel the chemicals collide
Stars and satellites spinning round and round
On the night you saved my life
Well, the morning is breaking and your heart is shaking
I remember how it feels right now
Well, we're lost in the moment
The sky is exploding, just keep on floating
Shut your eyes, feel the chemicals collide
You and I tonight, you're the sugar in my high
Shut your eyes, I feel the chemicals collide
Stars and satellites spinning round and round tonight
Shut your eyes, I feel the chemicals collide
I feel so alive spinning round and round
On the night you saved my life<start>If I'm closer to the sun,
I'm the furthest from someone,
I'm the chord that wont resolve,
A craze that won't belong,
And I just cannot leave,
I keep on burning from the heat,
I'm blinded from the spill,
Of light here she shines on me.
[Chorus]
And oh she's bringing in, she's bringing in the light,
And I'm, I'm getting it, I get it I'm alive
So don't count on your satellites,
To say she's here tonight,
Just know she's bringing in,
She's bringing in the light.
Oh she likes to lead,
Every way she lead me on,
She took the ground beneath my feet,
And drew me closer to the sun,
My mind is spinning right to the edge,
I'm veering out of control,
She gracefully reels me in,
And oh, here she comes, here she goes.
[Chorus: x3]<start>Don't believe what you hear and see
As the way things ought to be,
Dime a dozen doctrines
Are out there in the plenty.
They twist the truth and say
It's technicality.
They water down the meaning
'Tiil it becomes a nullity.
As long as it agrees
With what they want to think,
The truth that was once in their heart
Will soon become extinct.
It's the fashion of today
This Tinkertoy religion,
But nothing lasts forever
When it's based on on your emotion.
It's time to question what you think,
And challenge its validity,
It's time that you embrace the truth,
And question stupidity.
There's so many ways
In theology
They try to make solutions
Through psychology.
What they have invented,
Is some philosophical excuse,
They blame their imperfections
On ritual abuse.
If you avoid the real problem
You'll never find relief,
And if you want to be free,
Then ditch your misbelief.
How do you distinguish
What is wrong from right
When your standards are so relative
And vary overnight?
What it seems to me
Is the Truth is what you fear,
And if you face up to the facts
You might lose what you hold dear -
A make-believe reality
Where you're always right,
So you concoct and fabricate
To feed your appetite.<start>You know my name

Too feeble to let go.
And you want to bite the hand.
Should have stopped this long ago.
Go now, you've been set free.
Another month or so you'll be gorging on me (poisoning me on 2nd and 3rd times)
With your lovely smile.
I see you slither away with your skin and your tail,
Your flickering tongue and your rattling scales
Like a real reptile.
Had you coiled around my arm.
How could you ever know
How I loved your diamond eyes?
But that was long ago. (chorus)
And I should have believed eve.

She was the apple of my eye.
It wasn't long ago. (chorus)<start>She broke down and let me in
Made me see where I've been
Been down one time
Been down two times

Come down and see me again

Been down two times
I'm never going back again<start>You don't look hard to find
What's deep in your mind
It's easier to hate than see
Your convictions of stone
You kill off your own
You desperately want to be
Masses dead inside open up your eyes
You're broken and cold seeing your blindsight
Why's humankind going down
Am I the only one that can see it
Am I the only one that can feel it
Why's the human mind slowing down
Am I the only one that can see it
Am I the only one
You're going down
I see through your disguise
Your self-righteous lies
Destroy what you don't understand
I cannot help but feel
That time doesn't heal
Impressions that will never mend
Masses dead inside open up you eyes
You're broken and cold seeing you blindsight
You're going down sucker
Why's humankind going down
Am I the only one that can see it
Am I the only one that can feel it
Why's the human mind slowing down
Am I the only one that can see it
Am I the only one
You're going down
You're going down
You're going down
You're going down sucker
Yeah, yeah sucker
I have come to realize
When I look in your eyes
I'm staring back at me
Why's humankind going down
Am I the only one that can see it
Am I the only one that can feel it
Why's the human mind slowing down
Am I the only one that can see it
Am I the only one
You're going down
Why's humankind going down
Am I the only one that can see it
Am I the only one
You're going down
Why's the human mind slowing down
Am I the only one that can see it
Am I the only one
You're going down
You're going down
You're going down sucker<start>A single shot then silence springs
An alarm that blew my whole world apart
Infection spread like a hornet sting
The mark of Cain on a bullet
Shot through a poisoned heart
I could feel the taste of bile come up
Then drop like fire washed with gasoline
Too much just ain't enough when bloodied hands come clean
Then we step off the land
Into the fire
Out of the pan
Into the fire
Just grab my hand
And hold on tight
I'll pull you to
The guiding light
The candle flickered, the wind it howled
The waters crashed, the ship set sail at last
I sometimes sense my brothers scowl
Was molded into a smile
By the coroner's wax
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Rosetta Stone, no laughter
In the face of mirth
No phoenix rising from the rust
From the earth to the earth<start>Instrumental<start>Now I'm sitting here wondering where you are.
Up inside the sky I see a shooting star, and I wish, I wish you'd let me love you.
An outsider in your own hometown
Tellin' me you hope I know my way around and I do,
And I wish you'd let me love you.
Oh, it's cold inside.
Oh, it's cold inside.
And I'm cold too.
Been lookin for a way around
No getting through till your walls come down
But there's hope - a chance you could be happy
You look great in black and white but I know what you really wanna wear tonight
And you can, and you won't.
Oh, it's cold inside.
Oh, it's cold inside.
I'm cold too.
You taught me how to wear my colors.
I'll show you how to wear yours, too.
Now I'm sitting here wondering where you are.
Up inside the sky I see a shooting star, and I wish, I wish you'd let me love you.
I wish you'd let me love you.<start>Solo soy marioneta de tus dedos

you are just a basket case
it's so hard to face you're face

I'm faded and dreary
When my love is away
My cover is blown
When she leaves me alone
I'm weathered and weary
The nights are the days
When my love is away
When she's near the new year's here
And there is not a resolution that I can't do,
I see things clearly when she's near me
When she's near me all the world is new
When life gets me vexed
I stop thinking clearly
I can get so afraid that I push her away,
Repentance is next
I miss her so dearly
See those nights are the days
When my love is away
When she's near the new year's here
And there is not a resolution that I can't do,
I see things clearly when she's near me
When she's near me all the world is new
I'm waiting for the day when I am on her mind,
I'm waiting for the day when love's no longer blind, blind
When she's near the new year's here
And there is not a resolution that I can't do,
I see things clearly when she's near me
When she's near me all the world is new [Repeat: x3]<start>Ah Lucille

But I love you still

Ah Lucille
Baby satisfy my soul
Well you know I love baby
I'll never let you go
Babe I woke up this morning
Lucille was not inside
I asked her friends about her
But all their lips were tight
Lucille
Please come back where you belong
Well I'm talking to you baby
I'll never put you on
Ah! Wha'!<start>How much is too much?
I'm tired of predicting to lose.
But before you point your finger,
Before you cast your stones,
Take a look at yourself.
How can you expect from someone what you won't do yourself?
There's no bottom to your reality.
Your desperation is utter and complete.
What you can't love about yourself you have to steal from someone else;
And what you can't steal you have to deny.
Rapid Decompression.
Sometimes it feels like your whole world is coming to an end.<start>ê²ì´ ëì ììì¡°ì°¨ ì í´ ë´¤ë¤ë©´ ê·¸ë í¬ëëì§ ë§ë¼ ì¢! (GG)

Here comes that sun again
That means another day
Without you my friend
And it hurts me
To look into the mirror at myself
And it hurts even more
To have to be with somebody else
And it's so hard to do
And so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away
With so many people
To love in my life
Why do I worry
About one
But you put the "happy"
In my "ness"
You put the good times
Into my fun
And it's so hard to do
And so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away
And head for the door
We've tried the goodbye
So many days
We walk in the same direction
So that we could never stray
They say if you love somebody
Than you have got to set them free
But I would rather be locked to you
Than live in this pain and misery
They say time will
Make all this go away
But it's time that has taken my tomorrows
And turned them into yesterdays
And once again that rising sun is droppin' on down
And once again you my friend are nowhere to be found
And it's so hard to do
And so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away
And head for the door
You just walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Just walk on, walk on, turn and head for the door, just walk away.<start>Revelations of the mind
Destination changing all the tides
Hate the way, speed of light
Innocent cannot feel this fight or get it right
Falling away, a generation dies
And going in to the new times
Generation day, shot!
Situation coming strong
Premonition, spinning worlds along
Don't you see, it's do or die
Cannot be dead, cannot tear it down to make it right
Falling away, a generation dies
And going in to the new times
Generation day, shot!<start>And I'll be seeing you, in all the old, familiar places,
That this heart of mine embraces, all day through,
And in that small cafe, the park along the way,
The children's carousel, The chestnut trees and the wishing well,
And I'll be seeing you, in every love me summer's day,
In everything that's light and gay, I'll always think of you that way,
And I'll find you, in the morning sun, and when the night is young,
I'll be looking at the moon, but I'll be seeing you.
(followed by Up On The Hill instrumental<start>When all the love
Has turned to hate
How can we relate
When all the things we say
Are heard another way?
When all the trust
Has turned to doubt
Who will hear it out
And strive to take the time
See what it's all about?
How can we relate?
Love has turned to hate
If all the light
Will burn and fade
What will separate
The day from night?
Or is it shades of gray?
When bridges broken
Wash away
Is there any hope
That there will be a link?
A way to clemency?
How can we relate?
Bridges wash away
How can we relate?
When all our songs
Are tools of jade
How can we convey
The things we need to share?
Is there a better way?
When falling short
Our dreams retire
Mired and smothering
In self-beguile and shame
How can we make the scene?
How can we relate?
Is there hope in fate?
How can we relate?<start>Morning comes too early ,
And night time falls too late.
And sometimes all I want to do is wait.
The shadow I've been hiding in
Has fled from me today.
I know it's easier
To walk away,
Than look it in the eye.
But I will raise a shelter to the sky
And here beneath this star tonight I'll lie
She will slowly yield the light
As I awaken from the longest night.
Dreams are shaking set sirens waking up tired eyes
With the light the memories all rush into his head.
By a candle stands a mirror of his heart and soul she dances
She was dancing through the night above his bed.
And walking to the window
He throws the shutters out against the wall
And from an ivory tower hears her call
"Let light surround you"
It's been a long, long time
He's had a while to think it over
In the end he only sees the change
Light to dark
Dark to light
Light to dark
Dark to light
Heaven must be more than this
When angels waken with a kiss
Sacred hearts won't take the pain
But mine will never be the same
He stands before the window
His shadow slowly fading from the wall
And from an ivory tower he hears her call
"Let the light surround you"
Once I was but I was found.
When I heard the stained glass
Shatter all around me.
She whispers words to clear my mind.
I once could see but now at last,
I'm blind.
I know it's easier
To walk away,
Than look it in the eye.
But I have given all that I could take.
And now I've only habits left to break.
Tonight I'll still be lying here surrounded
In all the light.<start>when obstruction blocks my way
to whom shall i turn
when i can't tell my nights from day
to whom shall i turn, oh lord
streach forth thy mighty hand, rescue should i stray, father i know you can
please lead the way

to whom shall i turn
when i can't face this world with a smile
to whom shall i turn, oh lord
streach forth thy mighty hand, rescue should i stray, father i know you can
please lead the way
i turn to jesus
i turn to jesus
my hope and my trust
my hope and my trust
he'll deliver my soul

from trouble and striff
it's from your blood
it's from your blood

forever keep me

Gone to heaven instead
The evening news says he was confused
The motorways will all merge soon
Lottery winner buys the moon
They've come to save us
The space invaders are here
He thought of cars
And where, where to drive them
And who to drive them with
And there, there was no one, no one
There's panic at London Heathrow
Everybody wants to go up into the blue
But there's a ten year queue
Columbia is in top gear
It shouldn't snow at this time of year
Now America's shot gone
And done the lot

Where to fly to
And who to fly there with
And there, there was no one, no one<start>Paint the windows black

Believe it or not i wanna flip him the bird ya know!
but i don't!
Cause we women don't.
Once i gave the finger to a bunch of construction dudes
and they were yelling really bad stuff about my
cookie
It just got em all rowel up and then they yelled "dyke"
and i had PMS so i cried all the way home
Gross, gross, man...
still gawking as i sit here writing
Gee, what's he thinking?
Maybe I'll invite him up to my
SEX DEN
and he can fondle my boobies?
YEAH RIGHT!
Stupid gross man quit starn'
Gosh he wont let up,
it makes me feel really uncomfortable
i wish i could just crawl under a rock.
Cause we women
we are just suppose to feel bad about are selves
like were doing something wrong,
IM NOT I SWEAR!
Being we women sux!
FUCK YOU!<start>Well I rode the green across this country.
Horses lived and died to take me.
Men I killed to help me get there, further West I died to
Take me.
Blackened face and dirty laundry.
Many days since
I have eaten.
Found myself a family.
Broke my back
So I could feed them.
[Chorus]
High in the wind.
Standing in the sun.
We're going to raise up the heavens.
With a shovel and a gun.
I was so much younger then.
I would never ever listen.
I am so much older now.
I thought that things would
End up different.
Farewell, lover in green.
Elizabeth she is my lady.
Says the prayers and
Does the learning.
Waking up all the children.
Making love in the early morning.
We took to building up the cities.
we built the churches
In our cities.
Happy in the green country.
In the green
They buried me.
[Chorus]<start>I got my head in the clouds
Running from the thunder
Proud as I can be I am
Waiting for the grey to replace the black in me
Daddy, will the sun come up again
You and me, we fail to see
Nothing lasts forever
It's plain to see, you will agree
It's hard to stay together
Will we keep the thieves away
Will we both remember
To make the best of every chance
Or will we just surrender
Shouldn't we be making
Any effort needed to
Stop our dreams from fading
The sky is fading black to blue
We should be together
I am runnin' out of faith
And it takes something more each time
Before I put my heart in your hands daddy
You and me, did we fail to see
No one stays together
No it won't be easy
You will agree
To make this a forever
Will we keep the thieves away
Will we both remember
To make the best of every chance
Or will we just surrender
Shouldn't we be making
Any effort needed to
Stop our dreams from fading
Fading, fading, fading, fading, ooh<start>Ever since I was eight or nine.
I've been standing on the shoreline
All my life I've been waiting for something lasting
Oh this town kills you when you are young
Oh this town it kills you when you are young.
I'm not the boy that I used to be
This town has got the youth of me
All the eyes turn hollow
From the work of sorrow
You die young
You die when you're young
You die when you're young
We are shadows
Oh, we're shadows
Just shadows in the alley
Standing on the paving
By the office building
There's so much to do
Never time for you
You die young
You die when you're young
You die when you're young
We are shadows
Oh, we're shadows
Just shadows in the alley
I've got nothing
Nothing to wait for
Nothing to wait for
Ooh
Where is life in this town?
Where is life in this town?<start>(Five six seven fifty)
You fucked it up
You should've quit
Till circumstances
Had changed a bit
You fucked it up
You jumped the gun
I swore you off but
You climbed back on
And when you said
Of course you know
Could I be blamed
If I'd wished it so
I don't think so
You fucked it up
Or was it you
'Cause when you said it
I said it too
What of it<start>Its harder to tell you all
I miss the way it used to be mine
As Im laying on the rain, theyre dancing slowly
Its like a puzzle in place where no one have been
For only a word, only a moment, only a sign or maybe a lifetime
Im lost in here and Im giving us a second chance
To forget about the rest
Well maybe a lifetime cause Ill hold on for seconds
Only a shining livid light to share
Cause youre bringing air to make me feel like Im alive
Im alright if you die, Im alright if you dont ...<start>Saturday night Saturday night

I need it yesterday
I've always been that way, oh

How long has it been

Make it through the darkness

Back in the moment
I'm so grateful that you stayed
The order of the day

I suspected there was something that you weren't telling me
And last night I learned the reason for it all
I was looking through your window saw you kissing someone else
You reached up and turned my picture slowly face to the wall
Face to the wall so you wouldn't have to see anything at all to make you think of me
Did the cheapness of the moment make you feel ashamed and small
Was I farther from your conscience standing face to the wall
Alone out in the darkness were the eyes that worshiped you
As you cheated me I watched my idle fall
With your arms around another and his lips where mine should be
Then I saw you turned my picture slowly face to the wall
Face to the wall...<start>Genius is in the mistakes (Woo!)
The rules do not apply (They don't)
Maybe the wrong time and place (What, huh?)
Listen to the voice inside
Hey, just cause he ain't tall (tall)
So I met him at the mall (mall)
Doesn't mean I should write him off
To the naked eye
To the conscious mind
Shouldn't be denied
Listen to the voice inside
So (so what?)My friends don't think he's cool
He likes Coltrane, I like Tool (Who's that?)
He wears leather patches on his tweed
Yeah! but I know that he's deep (teach me)
The company I keep (whatever)
May not be the company I need
To pay attention to this serendipity (Serendipity)
Genius is in the mistakes (Woo!)
The rules do not apply (They don't)
Maybe the wrong time and place (What, huh?)
Listen to the voice inside
Genius is in the mistakes (Woo!)
The rules do not apply (They don't)
Maybe the wrong time and place (What, huh?)
Listen to the voice inside
Every big decision is a trial by fire
Wisdom acquired
Fuel my desire
ooh, baby, my heart aspires to genius
Genius is in the mistakes (Woo!)
The rules do not apply (They don't)
Maybe the wrong time and place (What, huh?
Listen to the voice inside
Genius is in the mistakes (Woo!)
The rules do not apply (They don't)
Maybe the wrong time and place (What, huh?)
Listen to the voice inside<start>you were walking by
you were looking so sly
with a cigarette
when you caught my eye
it was love at first sight
and i was hypnotized
but nothing ever materialized
i kept it all inside
held my feeling in disguise
and i know this much is true
that you never knew
that it could have been you
[Chorus]
well i guess you never knew
that it could have been you
i saw you sitting there
didn't have a care
black leather jacket and purple hair
wanted to ask you out
but i walked away
cause i didn't know what i could say
now i think back to that day
could things have gone a different way?
but i know this much is true
you never had a clue
that it could've been you
[Chorus]
it could have been...
a perfect match to go down in history
better than sid and nancy
a love to last 'til the end of time
my punk rock valentine
i could've been yours
and you could've been mine
will there ever be a next time?
is there such a thing as destiny?
will we ever be a reality?
all that could have been
all that may never be
is this the end of our story?
they say all things fade away
another guy will come my way
but i've never seen anyone like you
and you never knew
that it could have been you<start>People are all the same
People are all insane
Living underground
Would you like to separate your time?
Living underground
Would you mind to elevate your life?
People, a dying breed
People, an ending dream
Living underground
Would you like to separate your time?
Living underground
Would you mind to elevate your life?
People, only people, only people
Would you mind?
Would you mind?
Would you mind at all?<start>Maybe it was the moonlight, the scent of you on the breeze
Maybe it was your shadow that fell over me
Such a beautiful stranger, eyes darker than coal
Your first look crossed the desert into my soul
Mi corazon es perdido a ti
My heart is lost to you
You have captured my love completely
My heart is lost to you
My heart is lost to you
Maybe it was the music, the way it moved with your hair
Or the heat of the moment that hung in the air
But when I saw you there dancing, mesmerized by your gaze
There was some kind of magic that led me away
Mi corazon es perdido a ti
My heart is lost to you
You have captured my love completely
My heart is lost to you
My heart is lost to you
Oh la, la, la la, la, la la, la, la
Forever I'm under your spell
Oh la, la, la la, la, la la, la, I can tell
Mi corazon es perdido a ti
My heart is lost to you
You have captured my love completely
My heart is lost to you
My heart is lost to you<start>Melancholy mood
Forever haunts me
Steals upon me in the night
Forever taunts me
Oh, what a lonely soul am I
Stranded high and dry
By a melancholy mood
Gone is every joy
And inspiration
Tears are all I have to show
No consolation
All I see is grief and gloom
Till the crack of doom
Oh, melancholy mood
Deep in the night
I search for a trace
Of a lingering kiss
A warm embrace
But love is a whimsy and flimsy as lace
And my arms embrace an empty space
Melancholy mood
Why must you blind me?
Pity me and break the chains
The chains that bind me
Won't you release me, set me free?
Bring her back to me
Oh, melancholy mood<start>If you see a faded sign by the side of the road that says
Fifteen miles to the, Love Shack, Love Shack yeah
I'm headin' down the Atlanta highway
Lookin' for the love getaway
Headed for the love getaway, love getaway

I know you think it's crazy
But I can feel it in my bones
The way the cars and people move
Slow and stop all up and down my block
I can almost hear the trumpets sound
I wish all my friends could be here now
To see these tables turning
That man waiting at the station
Could be an angel sent to whisk me away
The way his coat hangs funny on his back
I bet he hides his wings under there
I can almost hear the trumpets sound
I wish all my friends could be here now
To see these tables turning
If I could change one thing about myself
I would not take it all so seriously<start>There's a place out near the eighties
South of the border, west of the sun
And if we send out all the A-team
Silhouettes will creep out of the dark
There's a place out in the nineties
North of the border, east of the light
We can send out all the be	-team
Silhouettes will creep out every time
In a time before the forties
North of the border, south of the sun
Well, we can send out anybody
Silhouettes will creep out of the dark
In a time after the fifties
South of the border, east of the light
We can send out everybody
Silhouettes will creep out every time
Come all you faithful and rise
Things aren't what they might seem
With all the makeshift lies
You'll never come back clean
You'll never come out clean
Come all you faithful and rise
Things aren't what they might seem
With all the makeshift lies
You'll never come out clean
Come all you faithful and rise
Things aren't what they might seem
With all the makeshift lies
You'll never come back clean
You'll never come out
And silhouettes will creep out of the dark<start>Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around and chose your own ground
For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be
Here's a message to the newborns
Waiting to breath, if you believe you can achieve, just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard, we carry on
Living in the projects, broke, with no lights on
Here's a message to the newborns
Waiting to breath, if you believe you can achieve, just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard, we carry on
Living in the projects, broke, with no lights on
No lights on, no lights on
Run, run rabbit run
Dig that hole, forget the sun,
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race toward an early grave
Early grave
Early grave
Breathe, breathe in the air
Waiting to breathe, breathe
Breathe, breathe in the air
Breathe, breathe in the air
Waiting to breath, breath
Breathe, breathe in the air

No lights on, no lights on<start>One more mother with a broken heart
One more family is torn apart
One more orphan out in the cold
One more fear that takes control
One more tangled in the same old lies
One more shackled to the same old highs
One more scared of what tomorrow brings
And one more chasing yesterday
Lord, let Your kingdom come
Who can right every wrong
You are the only One
Who can calm every storm
You are the only One
You alone are Father, Savior, Spirit, Healer, Redeemer
Lord of all
You are the only One
One more skeptic to believe
One more prisoner has been set free
One more longs to be Your hands and feet
One more standing for the least of these
One more praying in the morning light
One more shining in the darkest night
One more life worth fighting for
No greater love worth dying for

Lord, let Your will be done
Who can right every wrong
You are the only One
Who can calm every storm
You are the only One
You alone are Father, Savior, Spirit, Healer, Redeemer

You are the only One
I want to know You more
I want to make You known
I want this world to see
That You're alive in me

You are the only One
Who can calm every storm

Let the flames reach high and singe my tired feet
Remove the plank, yeah, expose the mystery
Show them polar opposites, don't show them in-betweens
If this is what you got then this is what you need
Behold, honest appraiser of what you should receive
At last come down, scoop up your baby bird
And we might know your word
Don't be afraid, you got it let it go
We're only getting by on illusions of control<start>Oh yes, I'm the great pretender
Pretending that I'm doing well
My need is such, I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell
Oh yes, I'm the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I play the game, but to my real shame
You left me to dream all alone
[Chorus]
Too real is this feeling of make believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal
Oh yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughing and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around
[Chorus]
Oh yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughing and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around<start>- .

She said, "Stop what you're doing and baby come on home."
[Chorus:]
I can't hold out,
I can't hold out too long.
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone.
You said, "Baby don't you worry, you're my heart's desire.
You know that I love you, I can't stand to see you cry."
[Chorus]
She said, "Baby you can run, you can walk or fly.
You know that I love you, you're my heart's desire."

I talked to my baby, I talked to my baby.
I talked to my baby, I talked to my baby.
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone.<start>I been in this town so long that back in the city I been
Taken for lost and gone and unknown for a long, long time
Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl from the
Spanish and Indian home of the Heroes and Villains.
Once at night, cotillion squared, the fight, and she was right
In the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night unafraid of what
A dude'll do in a town full of Heroes and Villains.
Heroes and Villains
Just see what you done-done
Heroes and villains
Just see what you done-done
Stand or fall, I know there shall be peace in the valley, and
It's all an affair of my life with the Heroes and Villains.
In the cantina, Margarita keeps the spirits high.
There I watched her, she spun around and wound in
The warmth, her body fanned the flame of the dance.
Dance Margarita! Don't you know I love you!
My children were raised, you know they suddenly rise.
They started slow long ago, head to toe, healthy, wealthy, and wise.
I been in this town so long, so long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff to ride in the rough, and Sonny,
Down snuff, I'm alright by the Heroes and Villains.<start>It's all too clear now
Well I been running away
Almost on the hour of mostly every day
Now I see colors
That I never seen
And now reddest of them all so vibrant out of me
Without you
I don't know how to be
See this zero
The lowest of the low
I let you take me down until lower I could not go
Now I see scars
I willingly made
I facilitated one need
Now here I lay
Tell me what was I
What was I thinking
Tell me what was I
What was I thinking
Tell me what was I
What was I thinking
Tell me what was I
What the hell was I thinking<start>Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm<start>I see that behind your eyes you're filled with fear, but you just run away.
You want to sit down, you want to talk nowÃ¢??let us get beyond this somehow.
Broken hearts are meant to be free.
Instead you crawl back, your eyes have turned black.
Falling down so everyone will see that never once did you believe.
Don't go. You just run away, you just run away from me.
Turn and run away from who you're meant to be.
Clearer and clearer, you're drawing nearer.
When you return I will be here, I promise this is where you belong.
But you just leave it, you never want it
Because every time it's just the same old story
??Will you ever let me be?Ã¢??
Don't go. You just run away, you just run away from me.
Turn and run away from who you're meant to be.<start>I hear you in my sleep
I've fallen in too deep
Sometimes it's hard to keep
Secrets, secrets
It's like a breath of air
I feel it everywhere
And still I can't declare
Secrets, secrets
Gotta keep whispering on the phone at night
Gotta keep whispering, gotta get it right
Gotta keep whispering 'til the morning light
Secrets, secrets
I need you by my side
Can't say I haven't tried
Sometimes it's hard to hide

Why did Georgia wash your clothes and get a job
Pull your socks up leave me love it ain't that hard

Free the white walls play to please and bleed the blues
Calm the cat calls faceless words don't define you
So take a seat and let me bore you
It's not enough that I adore you

Why's it always so that you were hard to please
Love to the nth degree
Why's it always so true
One heart to please love

Take your girl out
Dress her up and buy her shoes
What's the problem spend some cash and make it new
So take a seat and let me bore you
Slam the phone down lay the blame and walk away
You don't own this town you're not why I want to stay
Shut the fuck up let me bore you
I'm not so sure that I adore you

This heart, it will always feel like this
[Chorus]
Only God could stop me lovin' you
Only God could tell me not to
He sent you from Heaven
Just to make my dreams come true
When he opened the door
That you came walkin' through
Only God could stop me lovin' you
Now we stuck oil in Oklahoma, yeah
We won the Oscar in Hollywood
We climbed the canyons of Arizona
And, baby, makin' love never felt so good
These arms, they will never hold another
These lips, no other girl will ever kiss
This heart, it will always feel like this
[Chorus]
Well, there ain't no girl in the whole wide world
Could take away my heart
And there ain't no man who could steal
Your hand and tear us apart
But there is one God in Heaven above
Who gave me love strong enough to call my own

and with the hands of a surgeon keep this record from taking aim
and if that big sky should open up and swallow my life
on while it's just a field full of horses and lies that are taking place
If you don't care
Last days of the dinosaurs were so easy
Dancehalls to grocery stores the one your writing for who'll take their pants off slowly
take your notes you're sitting on your hands
you're in the graveyard hour
you kid don't stand a fucking chance
you're in the graveyard hour
You worry yourself sick in a town that doesn't give a shit
take it to your grave
boys and girls misbehaving in faith
sink your teeth in on the deep end of faith<start>Maybe let the doll house burn
Maybe I can hit and run
Maybe love was flicking through a magazine
Goes away two moons agree?
Starting over is for free
Maybe now I learn to taste the air I breathe
Feel the earth begin to move
Underneath my buckle shoe
Maybe this is just exactly who I am
Taxi's crawling up the hill
Take me where the world stands still
Away from where the air is frozen in your hands
Oh 36 hours away
36 hours away
In the moonlight
36 hours away
36 hours away
And it's over
In the middle going south
Dirty hands and empty mouth
I am indicating left and pulling out
Turn the map the other way
Through the hope and misery
And tilt the wheel towards the white lights up ahead
Oh 36 hours away
36 hours away
In the moonlight
36 hours away
36 hours away
And it's over
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
La la la la
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
La la la la
Oh 36 hours away
36 hours away
36 hours away
Oh 36 hours away
36 hours away
And it's over
And it's over<start>[Originally by Billy Joel]
Friday night I crashed your party,
Saturday I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again.
I was only having fun,
wasn't hurting anyone
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change.
I've been stranded in the combat zone,
I walked through Bedford sty alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain.
And you told me not to drive
but I made it home alive
so you said that only proves that I'm insane.
You may be right,
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light,
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know, you may be right
Remember how I found you there, alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled.
You were lonely for a man,
I said take me as I am
Cause you might enjoy
Some madness for a while.
Now think of all the years you tried
To find some one to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say.
If I'm crazy then it's true,
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way<start>Revolution rock, it is a brand new rock
A bad, bad rock, this here revolution rock
Careful how you move, Mac, you dig me in me back
An' I'm so pilled up that I rattle
I have got the sharpest knife, so I cut the biggest slice
But I have no time to do battle
Everybody smash up your seats and rock to this
Brand new beat
This here music mash up the nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your ma, tell your pa everything's gonna be all right
Can't you feel it? Don't ignore it
Gonna be alright
Revolution rock, I am in a state of shock
So bad, bad rock, this here revolution rock
Careful how you slide, Clyde, all you did was glide
And you poured your beer in me hat
With my good eye on the beat, living on fixation street
And I ain't got no time for that
Everybody smash up your seats and rock to this
Brand new beat
This here music mash up the nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your ma, tell your pa everything's gonna be all right
Can't you feel it? Don't ignore it
Gonna be alright
Revolution rock,
Everybody smash up your seats and rock to this
Brand new beat
This here music mash up the nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your ma, tell your pa everything's gonna be all right
Can't you feel it? Don't ignore it
Gonna be alright
Revolution rock,
To the cruellist mobsters in Kingstown,
With the hardest eyes and the coldest tongue
Is your heart so made of rock
That the blood must flow 'round the block?
Are you listening mobsters? Hey!
All people grow old, gotta die,
While those kinda fools go rolling by
It's food for thought, mobsters
Young people shoot their days away
I've seen talent thrown away
All you loan sharks!
The organ plays
And they're dancing to the brand new beat
This here music mash up the nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your ma-ma-ma-ma, tell your pa-pa-pa-pa everything's gonna be all right
Can't you feel it? Don't ignore it
Everything's gonna be alright
I say, revolution rocks
There's that old cheese grater
Rubbing me down
This must be the way out

'Til the morning's first light
What did I see?
I know it wasn't me there
I waited for you
For my dreams to come true
What will they be?
I hope I can see you hardly<start>Three fold the news that was breaking today,
I got a body in the back,
I have a feeling its watching me,
Now I'm confused so does this mean its free,
Take life so seriously,
Because we go round, the carousel of sound,
A bit of checking out next phase scars that
Move all around, lets go.
Deep routed opinion,
Suppressing the right to lead,
A life on your own terms,
Own mistakes own triumphs made.
Because I've been falling by the wayside,
Thinking about you all the time,
And you're so fickle,
Thinking about your broad smile,
We got before they weakened,
Could not stand for reason,
The truth, the proof, is coming back on you,
And now is the time to shoot through,
Right back in the face of decisions.
Where there's no sense, there's no feelings,
Were not going nowhere,
Lifestyle changed our worst fears.<start>Baby, we are lying here
Pretending that we're both asleep
I can hear your broken heart
And every single breath you breathe
It's hard to find the words to say
When we both hurt like this
So I close my eyes and pray
Time will heal what we're bound to miss
No one can ever say
Why it goes this way
Sometimes what we want isn't what we get
Sometimes what we get ain't really what we want
Sometimes what we want isn't what we get
Sometimes what we get ain't really what we want
It seems for every one we win
There's another three we lose
We've waited for the answer here
Only just to leave confused
You know you're forever mine
And baby, I'm forever yours
I've waited in the darkest rooms
Ooh, waiting in the open door
No one can ever say
Why it goes this way
Sometimes what we want isn't what we get
Sometimes what we get ain't really what we want
Sometimes what we want isn't what we get
Sometimes what we get ain't really what we want
We've been so long wishing for things
We just keep forgetting that we
Got all we'll ever need in you and me, yeah, yeah
You and me, you and me, baby, yeah
Everything we have, anything we got
It was given babe, it was given, babe
There ain't a thing we need that heaven forgot
It was given babe, it was given, babe
Everything we have, anything we got
It was given babe, it was given, babe
Ain't a thing we need that heaven forgot
It was given babe, it was given, babe
Everything we have, anything we got

There ain't a thing we need that heaven forgot
It was given babe, it was given, baby, yeah<start>Smile

I didn't pay no rent today, just so I could lie on the ground

Is our government makes a living licking shit holes

Too many stagedives into the pile.
Too many beers, too many cops.
Too many rednecks at the truckstop.
They hate our guts, don't like our kind.
But we turned the tables on some real swine.
Can't kill us, already dead.
Too much shit, that's in our heads.
Don't give a fuck what they said 'cause we're all, already dead.
Got no style, no grand finale.
Just hearing loss and an old Rand Mcnally.
Too many scams, too many creeps.
Lotsa fast food, nowhere to sleep.
They say we're wrong, gonna burn in hell.
Here's a nose load, choke on it pal.
Can't kill us, already dead.
Too much shit, that's in our heads.
Don't give a fuck what they said 'cause we're all, already dead.<start>I don't like livin' in this town
I don't like the way it makes me feel
It ain't much better when I moved around
Rolling around rolling from town to town
I don't like to be ignored
I don't like it when you stare me down
My heart and soul are torn twisted thorn woven all around your crown
I don't mean to sound condescending
There's no need in me pretending
Let the deal go down
Well it ain't no breaking news
No it ain't like it was
You got this thing you do
The thing you do
You know what it does
My head's been hanging down mmm...
Dark clouds follow me around
Follow me down
Rolling on from town to town
I don't mean to sound condescending
There's no need in me pretending
Let the deal go down
I don't mean to sound condescending
There's no need in me pretending
Let the deal go down<start>What if I told you I love you
What if I called you in rhythm
In this world there's nothing left
Well nothing that's new
What if I told you without
Loving is simply a lie
Although she moves into the night
Oh, tell me you're mine
Please say it's true
Oh, shame it's over
I was the light and the days of them all
Well push me over
I'm flat on my back but I'm having a ball
And just look whose laughing
What if I flew like a dove dear
What if I would you in rhythm
There's nothing left
Nothing that's good left for me now
Oh,I'll just go and sleep with strangers
I'll live like a lord in a tower
'cause in the city there's too mich air
That I can't dream at night
Well not anymore
Oh, shame it's over
It been such fun and we had a ball
Well push me over
But I'll be the last people to fall
Well just look whose laughing
Oh shame it's over
How like a cow bloated on grass
Well, push me over
Me on my back and you on your arse
Such a shame it's all over
There are so feel days left to grasp
So push me over
We on our back and you on your lazy arse
Well just look whose laughing<start>Instru<start>Oh mama what have I gone and done?
With all these years that I've been gone
My life changed me way too fast
I don't know if I could last
Help me find my way, and mama save me
Help me find today, mama please come and save me, oh
Oh mama if you could've only seen
Everything I've done and where I've been
If only one thing I would ask
Why did you let me grow up so goddamn fast?
Help me find my way, and mama save me
Help me find today, mama please come and save me, oh
There's nothing more that you can do
It's gone beyond what you can't help me through
An emptiness has covered me
Oh mama come and save me
Help me find my way, and mama save me
Help me find today, mama please come and save me, oh
Help me find my way, and mama save me
Help me find today, mama please come and save me, oh

To show what a good shot he was
Cost him fourteen dollars and ninety five
It's on the wall, can you see,can you see,
Can you see, can you see it?
She caught a stuffed tiger full of styrofoam beads
Do you see how she carries with ease?
A safe smile wiped across her face
No fear for his fabric teeth
You're a plate, you're a plate
You're a messy paper plate
You're a plate, you're a plate
You're a messy paper, ah
He swings a silver hammer on a copper plate
Sending lights shooting straight in the air
A brassy bell rings out but I hear one sound as he shouts
I'm the winner, I'm the winner, I'm the winner, I'm the winner!
Stuck carny smiles with no teeth at all
Counting stacks of green paper bills
Next to those milk jugs that just wont fall
And a bursting money till
You're a plate, you're a plate
You're a messy paper plate
You're a plate, you're a plate
You're a messy paper, ah<start>Lyrics: j perkin
I just saw a smile in the crowd and it reminded me of you
In the happy days before this solitude
Time stood still and I realized that against my will
Leaving forced loving into pain
Oh lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, lover, take me in your arms again
Gently heard your voice, felt you close
As if you were standing right beside me
As if I'd never went away
But I'm ready now to face this bitter wrong somehow
And proof what words can not explain
Oh, oh, oh, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, lover, take me in your arms again
Lover, lover, lover, lover, take me in your arms again
Lover, lover, lover, lover, take me in your arms again
I thought that I had lost my love
But you're the one I dreaming of
It came to hunt me everyday
And I tried to run away, I tried to be apart
But I can not escape a loving heart, a loving heart
I will understand if you can't like before
But please take me in your arms once more
Oh lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, lover, take me in your arms again
Lover, lover, lover, lover, take me in your arms again
Lover, lover, lover, lover, take me in your arms again
Lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Take me in your arms and hold me like before
Take me in your arms and I'll be yours
Once more<start>Some are gonna make it look easy, say moderation is the key
Moderation in the heart of excess, as long as you got the money
Some are gonna be just a cog in the machine
Some claim there's no cause higher than me
Some people, sweetheart, they're gonna play you for a fool
Gonna wait 'til you turn your back before they're cruel
Time to put it together, turn yourself back around
Give it right back to em, don't stop honey
Don't let them break you down
Some are gonna be slaves to their appetite
Some are gonna get depressed for success (don't they look nice)
Some are gonna get lost in the fog of the past
Some are gonna emerge from themselves at last
Some are gonna want to just bind you up and never let go
Some are gonna want to structure the universe to fit their ego
Some are gonna come off the charging like a bull
Some just want to smear themselves across something beautiful
Some say there's no ground left to stand on
That we are moving in the midst of an empty sea
Gotta jump ship in the middle of the ocean
Gotta jump ship lookin', find some new security.<start>A twist this time You buckle my mind Like a speechless boy It won't go away Got glass rain It cuts my feet I pull apart Yet refrain from the heart I've got water in my veins It won't go away Turns ice On which I slide
In my soul I have religion I try to preach it And it's stripped away It's beyond contradiction Just my fight with my grace
A dove in hand Do I crush it my friend? Why do I feel no guilt It won't go away This final fear I cannot see This love of hell in which I dwell It makes no sense It won't go away This way that I feel
Break it down Knock it down Push the wall down
Let go Let go of the hatred in your soul<start>i knew the way to get her
was to let her know
that i didn't want her
don't let it show
i knew i could not stop her
her mind was slow
she hoped i couldn't see her
when her tears would flow
now she's long gone
does she know the way
maybe she's wrong
but she likes the jade
and the walls of berlin
couldn't stand the hate
her walls are iron
and i cannot wait
now she's long gone
does she know the way
i know she's wrong
but she likes the jade
now to say i'm sorry
for my heart that's free
is to live in a silence
that's killing me
now to say i'm sorry
for my heart that's free
is to live in a prison
just you and me<start>I know that not everyone will die
But no one is promised they'll live
See it's broken but will not be separate
Without getting blood on the leaves
You're hungry
Like a thousand starving dogs
[Incomprehensible] to avoid
See I wanted, I wanted
My finger tips are numb
And I hear a strange distant hum
The lonely man that payed to see her

Always the same face, lost in the big mace
There's nowhere to hide for you.
Sometimes you act like a child as if you were million miles away
Always the same smile, you pretend to feel fine...
I got something to tell you,do you understand it?
I've got a message for you,won't you take it.
You close your eyes and you think there's no porblem
Just open your eyes, see you're falling
There was a time when we used to be friends
But now,what has vecome of you?
You follow the mainstream, always the same scene,ignoring the world around
Sometimes you act like a child, refusing to face the truth, always the same smile
You say "I fell fine"<start>Looking for something I've never seen
Alone, and I'm in between
The place that I'm from and the place that I'm in
A city I never been

We don't want you to see
We come, and we go
Here today, gone tomorrow
We're only taking turns
Holding this world
It's how it's always been
When you're older, you will understand
If I say who I know, it just goes to show
You need me less than I need you
Take it from me, we don't give sympathy
You can trust me, trust nobody
But I said you and me, we don't have honesty
The things we don't want to speak
I'll try to get out, but I never will
Traffic is perfectly still
We're only taking turns
Holding this world
It's how it's always been
When you're older, you will understand
And then again maybe you don't
And then again maybe you won't

Milk and honey
Do you want to love me
Under the aluminum sun
Did you hear those war torn stories
Where the lifeguards slept in the streets
In the jungle lands
With the cold cola cans
You'll get the keys to the city for free

Back on my feet
Walking down the street

Kind of a tool

Voldrs tronar amb mi,

Another year over, a new one just begun.
And so this is Christmas, I hope you have fun,
The near and the dear ones, the old and the young.
A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one without any fears.
And so this is Christmas for weak and for strong,
The rich and the poor ones, the road is so long.
And so happy Christmas for black and for white
For the yellow and red ones let's stop all the fights.
A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one without any fear.
And so this is Christmas and what have we done
Another year over, a new one just begun.
And so happy Christmas we hope you have fun

You say I've lost control
But you're driving down my road
With pockets full of secrets never said
I've got some things to say and I know you can relate
Kiss and tell I never tell
But I'd love to hear these words roll out your mouth
Run away with me tonight
It's getting late so sleep well angel
Because I'll be back tomorrow
We can stay up late and smoke it down
And feel the breeze beneath our feet
And chalk it up to friends with no families
We're on our own
We're okay you're okay
Just know that I am not giving up on you<start>Dnde est la salvacin que, mortal, buscas?

No me importa, si en mi vida ni hay remedio, ni entra dios.

Cunto gano!, y sin contar las pagas extras.
Cuntas horas! Y sin vivir.
No me importa: todo el da trabajando de cabrn.
Me importa que salga el Sol: no cobran, y es lo mejor.
Dnde est vuestra moral, que nunca entiendo
por ms vueltas que me doy?
No me importa; follo con mucha alegra y con placer.
Me importa tenerte a ti. Sin normas, no hay que fingir.
Subo al cielo desde un ciego,
aunque no haya quin me entienda.
Pobrecitos! Ya soy rico!
Ahora tengo quien me entienda.<start>It wore him down
His head was hanging sideways,
His lids were slits.
This happened almost nightly now.
He raised the glove
And waited for another round.
He waited for the bell to ring,
He prayed the lord would save his eyes.
He heard church-folk swaying and sighing
"it's all right."
He liked his kids,
He liked his sky-blue Valiant,
He like the pay.
"The boss' fine young talent"
They all would say.
And just a pension later
He'll be free,
Do what he wants.
Bereave the dream,
Now sleep,
Now slowly die<start>Push holes in the plastic
Immaculate dolls in the hands of a child with a ratchet
Two fingers too out of control

I can't believe it
Chew me up when needed
Turn over another day older
Another day nearer to jumping on over
Bloodsuckers and lovers that leave you
And tease you and cheat you, deceive you I see through
I hate it...
Don't want it...

And been told so many lies
No one cares what's on my mind
At all
I feel lost while on my own
There's no place I call home
But I still want to believe
I've not been mistreated
Not been mistreated
It's my heart that goes on
To believe there's someone
Who needs me to carry on
'Till the end I'm holding on
I've not been mistreated
Not been mistreated
Not been mistreated
I know in ways, have to be strong
Pouring my strain, it's turning out wrong
Feels like a stream of endless old fears
But I still want to believe
I've not been mistreated
Not been mistreated
Not been mistreated
I've not been
These are the days when dreams are lost
Bleeding in vain and wearing the cost
Of nonpaid lies, I'm crying for help
But I still want to believe
I've not been mistreated
Not been mistreated
Not been mistreated
I've not been
I've tried more than once before
To find out what I've done wrong
Still don't know how to go on
To understand why I've been mistreated, mistreated
Still don't know where to go
Still got no place I call home, call home
I've been hurt so many times
And been told so many lies
No one cares what's on my mind

And it broke me in two

I'm in love with love
Look out baby, it's gonna break you too
I'd pull your ship across the ocean wide
Hold my breath
And dive dive dive
If they held me at the bottom
Then asked me why
I'd open my mouth and I'd tell em why 'cause
I'm in love with love

And it broke me in two

So look out baby, it's gonna break you too

We're saying our prayers
Two lovers in the mist
With the salt in their hair
I'm in love I'm in love
And it broke me in two
I'm in love I'm in love
It's gonna break you too
Yes it will
The waves are breaking in a foreign tongue
Understand but I'm feeling numb.

I'd pull your anchor and hang on to it

Head on my pillow looking like a little ghost
Seems like all of the things that you gave me mother

Gets you wet and sometimes cold
Changing faces in the middle of a dream
Gets you old
Oh, gets you old.
Looking farther than you'll ever hope to see
Takes you places you don't know
Search for someone you can't ever hope to be
And still you go
Oh, still you go.
Don't you think it's kind of sad to say,
Don't you think it's gonna change?
Makes you think you'll have to stay inside
For a while.
Changing horses in the middle of a stream

Changing faces in the middle of a dream
Gets you old.<start>Send my fond regards to Lonelyville
I'm staying in my well-appointed valley on the hill
Oh, I'll grow hale on seawater
A son on the honey milk
And leave something to loneliness
Sweet William will
I once was there to find the girl that mystic morning's eve
There in the shade with all things up its leaves
Waking to the marvel to be northern to be free
You can hear the sound of southern bells follow where she please
Some with the forked tongues they'd love again to unlearn
Some for a heart a brushed yet stainless urn
You see some say for a spell well it's the last they're seen or heard
But for all the night falls for each alone, each alone will yearn
Now say hello to the Blind King
He was two hands younger and both empty of his Queen
In her place, the lone Spade waltzed right in to a silent hymn
See him bow and bend at twenty one and Jack the Blacksmith's crying
This is how they come to leave their loneliness
The weeks will pass in a tennis match
Before she for him undresses
For so long with no point for the Distant Mister and the Near Misses
T'will be love, love from above when at length the arrow hisses
The waterfall wallpaper clings to its dear life
Our 2D holiday burns clear through the night
The Holy Lonely lead their piebalds down to the tide
Singing, oh, no my heart will not be claimed by the fire
They cast the Independent Man his anchor and his spear
First in gold then out the capitol and through the prism of his tears
The moon sets to the great purse of the sea like a folding mirror
As pointed for the promise land the Sisters disappear
I set my prayers tonight for Lonelyville
To fall with the snow at that lone window sill
The ghost of the Wolf Moonlight to fall on Slater Mill
And leave something to loneliness Sweet William will<start>Within these walls their lies abide

Imitators of the archetype
Unaware of better life

Drawn into the open pyre of light
Into the open sea
Drawn unwillingly
A broken line of notion
Overshadowing the days
A one-way avail
In the emptiness of senseâ¨
We are drawn into the fraudâ¨
Within the power grids

Imitating time and again

Your hopes and dreams
Are trivial by your standards

And the stupid things
You say we like to slander
But we won't reel you out too far
'Cause after all, we need you for
Our ongoing quest
We've bonded here in faithlessness
To undermine your happiness
Toying with your paranoia
Everything you do annoys us
It annoys us
We remember how
You bought us all those gifts
You liked to make us think
You were so generous
Be careful in the future
Of everything you say and do
'Cause it can and will be used
Against you by us
We your dearest friends
Judge you "guilty"
Here and now
Of thinking you're a star

It's not the straw
No, it's the final straw you'll say
Finally you've grown a sturdy backbone
There'll be no invitation to
Your rocky coast this year
Your queenly voice will
Ice us down the telephone
You'll never guess who's joining us
For brandy later on
That's right, it's your bete noir from hell
That's who
Are you worried we might spill the beans
Are you worried we might tell
About your little visit to the bin when
You were cuckoo?

Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
That keep on falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Tell me
Why

I may be mad
I may be blind
I may be viciously unkind
But I can still read what you're thinking
And I've heard it said too many times
That you'd be better off
Besides
Why can't you see this boat is sinking
Let's go down to the water's edge
And we can cast away those doubts
Some things are better left unsaid
But they still turn me inside out
Turning inside out turning inside out

Why

And we don't cling together if there's nothing to find
Everybody stands alone in the line

As if a vision and blindness would have become allies
I can see a foreign rainbow
Of a land behind the sun
There's a world where the winds blow
In our mind, in our soul, in our want
We are so often helpless but we all seem to find
Hope and courage by something odd and strong in our mind
I know this is magic that we all have inside
I know this is magic that we all have inside

Built on dreams blameless and callow

Al telefono Ã¨ sempre un segreto
Quante cose in un filo di fiato

Si cresce in fretta alla tua etÃ 
Non me ne sono accorto prima
E intanto il tempo se ne va
Tra i sogni e le preoccupazioni
Le calze a rete han preso giÃ 
Il posto dei calzettoni
Farsi donna Ã¨ piÃ¹ che normale
Ma una figlia Ã¨ una cosa speciale
Il ragazzo magari ce l'hai
Qualche volta hai giÃ  pianto per lui

Far away from my skin

She's in a state of rage
How can I prove
That I've done nothin' wrong
You know in your heart
That you're all that I want
You're all fired up
Just a little bit too tight
Now babe whata can I tell you
You just ain't right
Ain't got a baad reputation
So why you tearin' it down
Don't know what happened
But your mind's gone south
No I can't believe what comes
Out of your mouth
You've got your mind in the gutter
You've got your mind in the gutter
I know what you're sayin'
But it just ain't true
You've got your mind in the gutter
Baby shame on you
So you say I'm foolin' 'round
Playin' the field
You know better
'Cause it's no big deal
I ain't gettin' a little
On thte side
Baby what can I tell you
You just ain't right<start>Someone put me on a plane
Goodbye, farewell, adios my friends
I need a holiday
S.a.s. is takin' off again
CHORUS: I want to have my fun
Where the nights are long
We want to go away
Where the sun will always shine
We're in heaven 2.9
Or just put me on a train
Goodbye, farewell, adios my friends
Tell her I said 'Hey'
And I might not come home again
CHORUS:
A London queen
Tokyo teen
A Frisco fag in the disco scene
A New York doll
And the Berlin boys
Can I ride in your car
Goodbye, farewell, adios my friends
Vacations at the jet set sunset bay
My girls are drivin' me insane
CHORUS:
We're in heaven 2.9
Ohoohoh
We're in heaven 2.9
Ohoohoh
We're in heaven 2.9
Ohoohoh
1999<start>I see you, I told you, I know you, I want it now
This rollercoaster is fucking us both around
Let's get this thing started we both know it's going down
Find a location and take this shit underground
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know how you feel
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know if it's real
Wanna take you home and see if we could strike up a deal
Wanna know what you think, 'cause I think we can sink
Into a full glass overdose of sex appeal
The closer, the contact, the statement you're in the clouds
Yesterday morning you hardly would make a sound
I know what you want so lets stop with the spinning wheel
Open you up and I'll look for the stuff that's real
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know how you feel
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know if it's real
Wanna take you home and see if we could strike up a deal
Wanna know what you think, 'cause I think we can sink
Into a full glass overdose of sex appeal
The moment I saw you, you felt like I had it made
You were a story and not just a single page
I look in your eyes and I know that you feel the same
'm here for the glory and not just to play the game
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know how you feel
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know if it's real
Wanna take you home and see if we could strike up a deal
Wanna know what you think, 'cause I think we can sink
Into a full glass overdose of sex appeal<start>I don't wanna be saved, I just wanna be done
She came as sudden as a bolt of lightning,
Does it matter where from?
I'm gonna stay, do it again
As of the end I'll begin to pretend
But it's too late all over again
Tell me we'll stick to the plans to the end,
Whatever comes
You are all I,
You are all I really need
It's the only way we know,
Manors of a ghost,
Can't we go home?
Always wrong
I'll go home,
It's so alone
I don't wanna be here,
Your eyes are worse than a bomb
It doesn't matter if there's nothing out there,
I just wanna go home
And there I'll stay, do it again
Wiggle it round' to the back of my hand
But it's too late, it's already gone
It's already gone
You are all I,
You are all I'll ever need
Are you alright?
There's no truth inside of me
But whatever comes barking up the wrong,
I could lead you through the storm
Find you shelter against the swarm
I'll be there whatever comes
(It's the only way we'll know whatever comes
It's the only way we'll know whatever comes)<start>Tonight the weight, the weight is more
I will wait no more<start>Every day she gets by
It's just another day closer to the day she die
The day is passing her by
And the night is just a sequence of her heavy cries
Heavy woman
[Ah!]
Heavy woman
When she turns around
Tremors where she stood on the ground
And I promise you you never heard a sound like the sound
Of heavy woman thighs
She don't see no reason why
That a man can't get a horn with the heavy life
Don't she know she don't fly?
She just keeps on shooting butter from her butter knife
Heavy woman
[Ah!]
Heavy woman
When she sat on the ?
On the floor it snapped
And I promise you you never want to find yourself trapped
In heavy woman thighs
Ooh!
Heaviness never lies
And heavy dreams lay beneath her heavy eyes
Yeah she was once a little girl
But somewhere down the line she fell into a heavy world
Yeah
Heavy woman
[Ah!]
Heavy woman
When she leans down
You can feel it in a neighbouring town
Then the scientists might think that it will affect the tides
When heavy woman dies<start>You're a fine one, oh yes you are
You're a fine one just like me
And we're friends now, oh wouldn't you say?
We've been friends now, oh haven't we?
Stay at home tonight if you know what's good for you
I can't say more it would be telling
For if you don't what will become of you
Just isn't worth any king's shilling
I will answer when they make that call, pull upon this ragged uniform
Up 'til now I know it's been your trade
Spit and polish the potato parade
Stay at home tonight if you know what's good for you
I can't say more it would be telling
For if you don't what will become of you
Just isn't worth any king's shilling
Please don't put your silly head in that pretty soldier's hat
You've done your duty, that's enough of that
I don't know if what I'm doing is right
I don't know if you should be forgiving
But for me it seems it means my life
While for you it could just be a living
Stay at home tonight if you know what's good for you
I can't say more it would be telling
For if you don't what will become of you
Just isn't worth any king's shilling
Please don't put your silly head in that British soldier's hat
You've done your duty that's enough of that
You're a fine one, oh yes you are
You're a fine one, just like me<start>Cold winter killed my soul
A spring time fuck was gold
For this my life I sold
For flesh and breath and bone
Got nobody to hold
Got no beauty in this place
Got no water in my cage
I wash myself in shame
I piss on my good name
In a scarlet candle flame
A dog on a rusted chain
I come for a lifetime stain, yeah
Got no beauty in this place
Got no water in my cage
Got pale moon to light my way
Got no beauty in this place
Got no water in my cage
Got pale moon to light my way
Got no water in my cage
No water in my cage
No water in my cage<start>Sometimes I used to wonder
I'm falling from the sky
I don't know have to love?
And have to share a life
Please don't tell me lies
I have a sparkles in my eyes
I'm just a simple man who wants
Wants to share a life
Don't call me an angel
I don't know how to fly
Don't say I'm a stranger
I just wanna be alive
Please let me touch your face
I want to take your pain away
I have a magic in my hands
I'll take you far away
Now only wind can blow away
The cursed to be a man
I just pick up my dream
And then I'll fade away
Don't call me an angel
I don't know how to fly
Don't say I'm a stranger
I just wanna be alive
Don't call me an angel
I don't know how to fly
Don't say I'm a stranger
I just wanna be alive
I'm not an angel - I have no wings to fly
I'm not an angel but you can call me, call me any time
Don't call me an angel
I don't know how to fly
Don't say I'm a stranger
I just wanna be alive
Don't call me an angel
I don't know how to fly
Don't say I'm a stranger
I just wanna be alive
Don't call me an angel
I don't know how to fly
Don't say I'm a stranger
I just wanna be alive
Don't call me an angel<start>-

This is the way back home.
Lover stole your heart and now your bleeding.
The needle in the vein is never dry.
The dagger in your side keeps you from breathing.
And this is what, this is what brings you back.
This is the way back home.
This is the way back home.
Lover stole your heart and now it's bleeding.
The needle in the vein is never dry.
The dagger in your side keeps you from breathing.
And this is what, this is what brings you back.
You're falling away.
You're falling away now.
You're falling away.
You're falling away now.
You mean everything to me.
You mean everything.<start>Lord, she needs someone to hold her when she cries.
She packed her few belongings left a note and now shes gone
And I cant stand to think of her out there so all alone
As soon as shes gone far enough to know shes out of sight
Shell pull off the highway and shell cry.
And she needs someone to hold her when she cries
Someone who really understands the way she feels inside
When her heart breaks the tears won't stop, no matter how she tries
And she needs someone to hold her when she cries.
I dont blame her for leavin Lord, she didnt want to go
But she thinks I dont love her or need her anymore
Ive driven her into a world as dark and cold as ice
With no one there to hold her when she cries.<start>All of the longing
Condensed in this place and time
I invoke you, O spirits, crawl inside
Then awaken my conscience
Lain dormant for all this time
And feed the despair that pervades my life, yeah
In the hold of a nightmare
I see truth in their words and lies
And beauty appears in sorrow's guise
So caught in the moment
We ignore the passing of time
And mistake the empty for the sublime, yeah
Oh, my savior
Give value to these misdeeds
In sin you bathe me
Holy
So I say that the father lies
And my dreams will betray me tonight
Obey the scourge of night
May darkness bring sight
I welcome your grace
Upon this night
All of the longing
And thoughts scribed in soothing fire
The ashes and smoke breed my desire
Abject and misshapen
To you I give all that I'm worth
My swarthy children of the earth, yeah
Oh, can these words be given shape
Oh, does the fool acknowledge fate
I've awaken the monster
The one that exists in my mind
In fear I behold the apparent divine
It grants me one vision
The mother in death giving birth
To the swarthy children of the earth, yeah
Oh, our savior
Pour deep within me
In blackness forsake me
Holy
So I say that the father lies
And my dreams will betray me tonight, yeah
Breathe slightly
Sleep soundly
All through this night
Breathe slightly
Sleep soundly
All through this night
I'm under its spell
I am too small
To try to resist the Ancient One's call
Will you be with me when I fall
I'm under its spell
I am too small
To try to resist the Ancient One's call
Will you be with me when I fall
I'm under its spell
I am too small
To try to resist the Ancient One's call
Will you be with me when I fall<start>Tuesday morning,
Never looked so good.
I'm already in,
In a daydream.
The sun is shining,
To wake me up.
No one around,
Just me and the sky.
I'm already in,
In a daydream.
I'm already in,
In a daydream.
The sky is calling,
Calling out my name.
Telling me just to stay,
Stay and don't go away.
I'm already in,
In a daydream.
I'm already in,
In a daydream.
In a daydream...
In a daydream...
In a daydream...
Already in a daydream...<start>(Instrumental)<start>Looking back at me I see
That I never really got it right
I never stopped to think of you
I'm always wrapped up in
Things I cannnot win
You are the antidote that gets me by
Something strong
Like a drug that gets me high
What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold
And I'm sorry about all the lies
Maybe in a different light
You could see me stand on my own again
Cause now i can't see
You were the antidote that got me by
Something strong like a drug that got me high
I never meant to be so cold
I never really wanted you to see
The screwed up side of me that I keep
Locked inside of me so deep
It always seems to get to me
I never really wanted you to go
So many things you should have known
I guess for me theres just no hope
I never meant to be so cold<start>Sat outside my front window
This story's going somewhere
He's well hung and I am hanging on
There's a song on the radio that says
"Let's get this party started"
So let's get this party started
What you do on your own time's just fine
My imaginations much worse
I just never want to know
And what meant the world had folded
Like legs and fingers holding on to
What escapes me what he has:
A better kiss that never lasts
You said between your smiles and regrets
"Don't say it's over"
Dead and gone
Dead and gone yeah
The calm before the storm, set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight
A reception less than warm, set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight
This is me standing in the arch of the door
Hating that look that's on your face
That says there's another fool like me
There's one born every minute
There's one born every minute
What you do on your own time's just fine
My imaginations much worse
I just never want to know (never want to know)
What meant the world imploded
Inflated then demoted all my
Oxygen to product gas
And suffocated my last chance
You said between your smiles and regrets
"Don't say it's over"
Dead and gone
Dead and gone yeah
Calm before the storm (set it of, set it off)
Calm before the storm (set it off, set it off)
The calm before the storm, set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight
A reception less than warm set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight
Sun burnt out tonight
The sun burnt out tonight<start>I loved you, I wanted you, I never really needed you
I loved you, I married you cause I really wanted to
I loved you, I wanted you, I never really needed you
I love, love, love, loved you
You didn't have to marry me, marry me, marry me
Why did you marry me if you never loved me
Liar, liar, I really loved you
I love you, love you, love you
I hate love
You pushed me, you pushed me
You didn't really want me
You never made love to me
You hardly every touched me
Didn't even talk to me, you made me feel like nothing
You lied, lied, lied, lied
You didn't have to marry me, marry me, marry me
Why did you marry me if you never loved me
Liar, liar, I really loved you
I love you, hate you, love you
I hate love
I cheated, I cheated and I am sorry
You're not the victim, you never loved me
You stole my integrity and now my life is empty
You lied, lied
Liar, liar, liar
I really loved you
You're evil
I really loved you
You're evil
I really loved you
You're evil
I really loved you
You're evil
You stole my integrity and now my life is empty
I was your shamrock and you were my black heart
Liar, liar, I really loved you
I hate you, hate you, hate you
I hate love<start>Wanna be
Your bread and butter
Wanna be
The honey in your jar
Wanna be
Your bread and butter
Wanna be
The honey in your jar<start>Can you tell me, tell me, friend, just exactly where I've been?
Is that so much to ask I'll pay you back no matter what the task
You seem really sure 'bout something I don't know,
Take that load off, looks like chest's about to go
Your wasted words already been heard, are you really god, yes or no?
Well, all day and half the night you're walkin' round lookin' such a fright
Good is it me or is it you?
I'd make a wager and I'd hope you lose
Time's gone, looks like Rome is 'bout to fall,
Next time take the elevator, please don't crawl
Your wasted words so absurd, are you really Satan, yes or no?
Tell me now baby?
Ooh hoo
Oh
Well, I ain't no saint and you sure as hell ain't no savior
Every other Christmas I would practice good behavior
That was then, this is now, don't ask me to be mister clean
Baby, I don't know how
Ring my phone 'bout ten more times, we will see,
Find that broke down line and let it be
Your wasted words will never be heard, go on home baby and watch it on TV
Weekday soap-box specialty, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout now
By the way, this song's for you, sincerely, me<start>When I woke up it was raining
Well, I got soaked
When I woke up this morning
I was cold and wet and broken
I ain't got no destination
I'm just gonna follow my shoes
I may run on up to Dallas
But the fiddle player's got the blues
Feel kinda like ol' Ray Charles
And Georgia on my mind
Sure wish I could get there
I ain't got a dime
These hard times that I'm having
I guess they call it paying dues
That's just how things get goin'
When fiddle player's got the blues
Yeah, he's got the blues
They say playing in these beer joints
Kinda keeps a man in touch
Sure beats pickin' cotton
But it just don't beat it much
I guess it all comes down
To whatever life you choose
And you know I ain't complaining
It's just the fiddle player's got the blues<start>City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air
There's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
City street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all
This bustle you'll hear
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
Soon it will be Christmas day<start>I don't look for no worries, worries and troubles come around
I don't look for no worries, worries and troubles come around
World keep on turning, I got to keep my feet on the ground
Nobody saw me cryin', nobody knows the way I feel
Nobody saw me cryin', nobody knows the way I feel
The way I love the woman, that bound to get me killed
Loved the little girl so good, she made my low down butter come
I loved the little girl so good, she made my low down butter come
I need the woman so bad, I need her like the sky need the sun<start>I get up every day.
It's a miracle, I'm told.
Somehow I live to work.
So I hit the road.
Squeeze into my hybrid car,
Drive as fast as I can
While I scan the rooftops.
Yeah, I scan the rooftops.
Don't shoot, I'm a man.
So don't shoot, I'm a man.
I live in every city
All around the world.
Sometimes its way too hot.
Sometimes its friggin' cold.
One thing's always the same,
No matter what they say,
There's way too many problems.
Way, way too many problems.
Don't shoot, I'm a man.
Don't shoot, I'm a man.
You wish you were swinging from the trees.
You wish you were slicing through the breeze
You wish you were a king or a queen.
You wish you'd hit the lottery.
But wishin' is for chumps, high hopin' is for fools.
They'll hunt you down.
They'll taze you bro for playin' with the rules.
Don't shoot, I'm a man.
Don't shoot, I'm a man.
I've got a big dilemma
To punt or go for broke
It's got me goin' sleepless
Well I'm about to choke
Let me ask you something
Answer if you can
Think before you answer
There is no correct answer
So don't shoot, I'm a man.
Don't shoot, I'm a man.
Don't taze me bro!
Don't taze me bro!
Don't taze me bro!
Don't taze me bro!<start>(Phil Lee)
That girl gets away with murder
That girl really likes to hurt him
Well, if I recall, I never ever did you that way
If I did, I'm really, truly sorry
I hope nobody ever pointed and said
When I was still in his world
Saying somebody oughta do something about that girl
That girl only wants to use him
Spend his money and confuse him
Sometimes, it might've seemed like I was doing him like that
But I know we're in it together
I hope nobody ever whispered my name
Down some dark alley
Saying somebody oughta do something about that girl
Yeah, somebody oughta do something about that girl
Some girls you just don't trust
Some girls are always one up on us
Breaking your heart, taking him away
Well, someone's gonna get her one day
That girl really likes to hurt him
That girl really don't deserve him
Well, once or twice maybe, I hurt him like she did
But I tell you, I didn't mean to
Well, I hope nobody ever pointed and said
Danni Leigh's the one wrecking his world
Saying somebody oughta do something about that girl
Yeah, somebody oughta do something about that girl
Somebody oughta do something about that girl
Somebody oughta do something about that girl<start>You keep asking us for more
But we're not in competition for your love
But there's time to figure out
What the world can do without
'Cause I can't live without this
No one wants to be the first to fall
And I'd be getting somewhere
If I could care
Cut in line and take your place
Whenever you choke
You're just another one to save
And it goes up in smoke,
The glory you so crave
No one wants to be the first to fall
And I'd be getting somewhere
If I could get my head around
If I could...
Care
No one wants to be the first to fall
And I'd be getting somewhere
If I could get my head around
If I could..
I don't want to be the first to fall
(But I can't live without)
And I'd be getting somewhere
If I could get my head around
If I could
Care
Cut in line and take your place<start>Star Cecil...left me alone...torn
This folding brush I found in starved I fell through
Too good to turn around
And you gave me much more to hold
Believing you here I dissemble
So now I'm sore, dissatisfied all the time remembered you told me
Said over the hills, catch me far away,
Far away...
Well now maybe,
We were so good enough to fly by
But now that summer died
We'd be so, we were going back for mine
Star Cecil...my heart in your hands...stone
Turn me to full, I'm empty I need you
So now I wait, for your return, capture, a present departure
Too tired, but I best be going home
Well maybe,
We were so good enough to fly by
But now that summer died
We were so, we were going back for mine
So now I'm hard, down, deeper
Enough to well bury my love tonight
Oh now I'm never gonna go back there
Star Cecil where'd you go tonight?
Bored, I miss you
Ooh yeah sore, we taste
Remember three years ago
Said bring me here please release my own tile
Now that summer died
You're wrong
Sore...we taste
Remember three years ago
Said bring me here please release my own tile
Now that summer died
You're wrong
Star Cecil...bring me home
Guess it's time to catch my own star...
Well now maybe,
We were so good enough to fly by
Well now that summer died
We were so, we were going back for mine
So now I'm hard, down, deeper
In us when it's so good enough to fly by
Well now I'm never gonna go back there
Star Cecil where'd you go tonight?<start>So many times I made you understand,
Im not the easy-going kind of man,
But youll never get me,
Never get me,
Never get me down.
So now looking back over the years,
You still expect me to cry my tears,
But theres no more foolin,
No more foolin,
No more foolin round.
And I will never change my life again,
Bein nothing but your loving man.
No I will never change my life again.
Dont you know
That I will bite back.
Bite back
Oh yes Ill bite back
Yes I will bite back.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
(Guitar instrumental)
And I will never change my life again,
Bein nothing but your loving man.
No I will never change my life again.
Dont you know
That I will bite back.
Bite back
Oh yes Ill bite back
Yes I will bite back.
[Various versions of the bite back line repeat to fadeout]<start>I will admit, I tend to be a little selfish
But only when it comes to
Something that I couldn't miss
The hardest part is trying
To know what I really want
(Woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh)
So I'll apologize ahead
For dragging you along
(Woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh)
Hey, there's just no better way
When there's nothing left to say
That you take back all the mistakes
I guess I finally found myself today
I know the feeling to be
Caught up in the motion
I often wonder if it's
Instinct or addiction
I'm slowly learning how to fake
I even have a clue
(Woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh)
Because I'm supposed to be
The very best at what I do
(Woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh)
Hey, there's just no better way
When there's nothing left to say
That you take back all the mistakes
I guess I finally found myself today
I always feel that the cloud around me
Is so free beneath my feet
And I must fall through
But I think I'm might meant to
If that's what it would take
For me to see
Hey, there's just no better way
When there's nothing left to say
That you take back all the mistakes
I guess I finally found myself today
Hey, there's just no better way
When there's nothing left to say
That you take back all the mistakes
I guess I finally found myself today
I think I finally
Found myself today<start>Instru<start>Little girl what's your name
Now don't you go looking at me like that
You might see I'm ashamed, what's your name
Talk with me, won't you talk with me
[Chorus]
Oh pretty girl
It ain't too hip faking lines you ain't taking
But your lips make me say it that way
Now there's no use you resisting
This is the Cradle Thief insisting
I think you better let me have it my way
Fool around with me, come on mess around with me
[Chorus]
Will you survive, learn to drive
I know you can't describe the dreams you want to be
Either stay or get away
I'm not playing around, can't you tell the way I'm squeezing
Your hand
I'm just a kid don't make me feel like a man
Silly girl I'm just playing
Now did you think that I'd be nuts enough to try an' pick you up
Don't you know it's a game, it's all a game I've been playing
But what'd you say your name was,
Walk with me, just around the corner baby maybe you could even
Try to talk to me
Damn you talk to me!
Damn you talk to me!<start>Intstrumental<start>On the sidewalk the people are hustling and bustling
They ain't got no time so they think on the thing
That will fill in the space in between birth and death
Who're they kidding?
On the TV the people are mumbling and grumbling
They ain't got no hope so they give out the news
That the world's got the blues, S.O.S. S.O.S.
Bless my soul
In the movies the people are identifying
They ain't got no season to split for no reason
And so they get by on the great community lie
On the sidewalk the people are hustling and bustling
They ain't got no time so they think on the thing
That will fill in the space in between birth and death
Who're they kidding?<start>so this judge he says to me
boy i've seen you here before
says the signs lit up of the streets
i says the blood disturbs me more
ooooh i think im faaalling down

I don't want to be around

You're nowhere in between
You rise

On dead-wood days
I don't want to be around
When you come down
I don't want to be around
You blind
You' glaze
You fire until you craze
You are my
Malaise
On dead-wood days
Parading Pollyanna's blister and hide away
You're valedictory and vertigo eyed today
Your grace with gravity is starting to slide
You sway
You wind
From torment to define
You pray
You find
A paradigm to redefine
You take
You find
It all goes by

With one wing colored brightly

When I'm running, oh
No I'm not made to tiptoe
I'm not gonna lay low
I just wanna run, wanna run
Oh I need to be all in
Swimming in the deep end
I just wanna run, wanna run
Yeah when it's over, said and done, I know they'll say I was one to run
How do you fight for love if you can't give,
Give enough
It's hard to say, harder to do
Let the rain pour down on you
No I'm not made to tiptoe
I'm not gonna lay low
I just wanna run, wanna run
Oh I need to be all in
Swimming in the deep end
I just wanna run, wanna run
Yeah when it's over, said and done, I know they'll say I was one to run
Yeah take a drink of water to rest so you can cool
But then you keep on going
Your passion is your fuel
No I'm not made to tiptoe
I'm not gonna lay low

We could lay outside on the beach all night
We can swim with the dolphins,
Go golfing,
Baby girl, you could be my wife
Now don't go fallin' in love with Mr. Wonderful
And I won't go running around with any other girls
I'll sweep you off your feet
(Thank me whenever)
I'll take you home with me
(Can't find nothing better)
I put the sweetness in your tea (t-e-e)
(Deal not sweet and low)
Your a little bit out of my league
(But I'm going professional)
You and me and the palm trees
We could lay outside the beach all night
We can swim with the dolphins,
Go golfing,
Baby girl, you could be my wife
Now don't go fallin' in love with Mr. Wonderful
And I won't go running around with any other girls
Who's on the other line?
(I'm standing right here)
We're running outta time
(We need to switch that gear)
Wouldn't mind being that stand-up guy
(So why are you sitting so weird)
Your a little bit out of your mind
(But I'm going crazy in here, crazy in here, crazy in here)
You and me and the palm trees
We could lay outside on the beach all night

You can tell your girlfriend
You would run away with me
You can tell your family, you set sail for the golden sea!
We could send them post cards baby, (bab-a-a)
I can see it now girl!
You and me and the palm trees

Baby girl, you could be my wife
Now don't go fallin' in love with Mr. Wonderful
And I won't go running around with any other girls<start>I always had my eyes on you
But you came from across the line
I had to make good time to see you
But you had to pay the fine
All the boys on my side knew
That you were the shark
If you were found on the borderline
You'd be shot in the dark
Don't wear those clothes again
They don't make it in this crowd
Don't go out D.T.K
You'll wear your best suit in the ground
We're meeting in a neutral zone
The last car on the train
The love you brought shaking up my bones
And crawling through our veins
We always met at the edge of a blade
And we left at the end of the fight
Of all the girls you've played and you laid
Why did this one have to be white?
They're gonna get ya at 12 o'clock high
Got their sights set low on you
You better believe me, I wouldn't lie
We better quit before you're through
They're gonna get ya at 12 o'clock high
Got their sights set low on you

the morning comes
nothing ever stays the same
I saw it written on your own face
You're not supposed to be the best of them
you never ever could
you're just supposed to stay the same
And I could live this that
for the most part
you were waiting on a change in a cold heart
And I remember you like you wanted
40 dollars before the day is gone
somebody told me something
nobody cared to tell you the truth
You never found a reason
Caught in a lie and it's all that you're used to
(living a lie)
Well I will rise
the morning comes
nothing ever stays the same
I saw it written all over your...
you're not supposed to stay around for this
you're not supposed to change
you're just supposed to go away
And I can live without
for the most part
you were waiting on a change, but a cold heart
won't remember you like you wanted
40 dollars before the day is gone
somebody told me something

nobody cared to tell you the truth
You never found a reason
Caught in a lie and it's all that you're used to

Living a Lie!<start>Remember when we were young
Like Eden was in innocence
No looking through the camera lense
And every moment was
A living lightning afterglow
A constant river's overflow
And somewhere in the back of your mind
Yours was more important than mine
Then you went on your way
Just being who you couldn't be
Without our love's intensity
I'll never go halfway
For me it's all or everything
There's just no living in between
And somewhere in the back of my mind
I can't seem to leave you behind
Baby don't worry 'bout this intensity
It's just the fury of my love
Things aren't what they seem to be
It's just what you mean to me
And it's just the fury of my love
Can we start over now?
A place the past has never looked
A pardon closing every book
Love covers all our doubts
Unhindered by the icy shell
That's grown around your heart so well
Somwhere in the back of your mind
I'm the one you're looking to find
Baby don't worry 'bout this intensity
It's just the fury of my love
Things aren't what they seem to be
It's just what you mean to me
It's just the fury of my love
I hope you don't think I'm scary
Drowning in the pain
I hope you can recognize that
Yourlove means everything
Baby don't worry 'bout this intensity
It's just the fury of my love
Things aren't what they seem to be
It's just what you mean to me
It's just the fury of my love
My love
My love
My love

I made my bed now I'm gonna lie in it
Seems instead like I'm gonna die in it
Where did I go wrong
I tried so hard to see
I tried so hard to be a man, a man, a man
You've seen my face, me I really don't mind it
They all laugh but I didn't design it
Where did I go wrong
I tried so hard to see
I tried so hard to be a man, a man, a man
Made my bed now I'm gonna lie in it
Made my bed now I'm gonna lie in it
I didn't know my Ma
Didn't see my Pa,
How can you understand
When you're the son of no man, no man
Made my bed now I'm gonna lie in it
Made my bed now I'm gonna lie in it
Made my bed now I'm gonna lie in it<start>If the sun should tumble from the skies if the sea should suddenly run dry

If it seems that everything is lost I will smile and never count the cost
If you love me really love me let it happen darling I won't care
Shall I catch a shooting star shall I bring it where you are if you want me to I will
You can set me any task I'll do anything you ask if you only say you love me still
When at last our life on earth is through I will share eternity with you
If you love me really love me let it happen I won't care
If you love me really love me let it happen I won't care<start>Yes your letter reached me early this morning baby
and I read every word you had to say
I said your letter reached me early this morning baby
and I read every word you had to say
But you know I just don't understand you waman
If you love me why in the world did you go away
Your letter said that you're doing ok
But then it read: "Please, let me come back home."
Your letter said that you're doing ok
But then it read: "Please, let me come back home."
Yes, you said you were so tired, so tired baby
And you wanted someone you could call your own
But memories don't fail me woman
I remember the day you left
Oh my memories don't fail me baby
I remember the day you left
Well you know you told me then and I believe you now woman
That you were grown and you've been take care of yourself
So now here is my answer baby
And the words come straight from my heart
Well, here is the answer to you letter woman
And the words come straight from my heart
Yeah it's against my will I know
I could love you still baby
But baby I just can't play the part<start>Er hatte braune Augen und auch braune Haare,
er hatte eine Brille und eine Gitarre.
Auf der Gitarre spielte er bis zur Ekstase,
und die Brille trug er immer auf seiner Nase.
Er sang wie ein Engel und war überall bekannt,
zum schlafengehen hing er die Gitarre an die Wand.
Doch seine Brille hat er niemals abgesetzt,
wo ist Buddy Holly's Brille jetzt?
Er war schlank und hatte Glück bei den Frauen,
er brauchte ihnen nur in die Augen zu schauen.
Wenn ihn die Brille dabei einmal störte,
dann sang er solange, bis sie ihn erhörte.
Er stieg in ein Flugzeug und grinste hinaus,
von oben sah die Erde überwältigend aus.
Das Flugzeug stürzte ab, und die Welt war entsetzt,
wo ist Buddy Holly's Brille jetzt?
Um die verschwundene Brille entstand eine Sage,
es hies, man könne singen, wenn man sie trage.
Viele Schurken waren deshalb hinter ihr her,
doch von denen trägt die Brille garantiert keiner mehr.
Es stand in seinem Testament, es war sein letzter Wille,
wenn ihr mich einst begraben müßt, dann nur mit meiner Brille.
Damit ist auch dieses Rätsel endlich gelöst,
Buddy Holly ist mit seiner Brille verwest!<start>He was born on easy streets
Played so hard his feet
They never touched the ground
Never felt afraid
Hour after shining hour
No thought of time
No parents worrying
Innocent of fear
Now my, my, look at that sky
Closing his eyes on a new tomorrow
Hey, hey, Heaven's in tears
Crying for the disappeared
She grew up on easy streets
Danced so hard her feet
They never touched the ground
Love was all around
No locks on their front door
She'd stay out late
And they'd know she was safe
No need to beware
Now my, my, look at that sky
Closing his eyes on a new tomorrow
Hey, hey, Heaven's in tears
Crying for the disappeared
My, my, look at that sky
Turning his back on a generation
Hey, hey, Heaven's in flames
And no one wants to take the blame
Blame for children of the disappeared
Bleeding, crying, children, dying
Parents who live in fear
(My, my, look at that sky)
Children who disappear
(Turning his back on a new tomorrow)
Bleeding, crying, children, dying
(My, my, look at that sky)
(Turning his back on a new tomorrow)
Parents who live in fear
(My, my, look at that sky)
Children who disappear
(Turning his back on a new tomorrow)
Bleeding, crying, children, dying
(My, my, look at that sky)
Their life with never be the same
For children who disappear
And parents who live in fear
No more the easy streets
No sound of children's
Footsteps on the ground
Fear lies all around
No more the unlocked door
No more the children
Laughing as they play
Nowhere left that's safe
Now my, my, look at that sky
Closing his eyes on a new tomorrow
Hey, hey, Heaven's in tears
Crying for the disappeared
My, my, look at that sky
Turning his back on a generation
Hey, hey, Heaven's in flames
And no one wants to take the blame
Blame for children of the disappeared<start>You wonder why do the things you do
With all the heartache that you've been through
It's only human to feel like this

And after all this time you still don't know why
It's only human to feel so much
It's only human the need to touch

Who's in love, in love with someone madly
Who's in love, in love with someone new

And will the answer be there for you to see

Waiting for the band to play
And I wonder what is left to loose
Where is anyone, any way
Outside a neon, face from exhaustion
Screaming with promise of what's inside
But nobody's watching

Nothing inside cause the world is on fire

No one listens, any way

Lying in wait

Your cover's blown
No where to go
Only your fate

Fire your guns
It's time to run
Blow me away

After the fall
We'll shake it off
Show me the way
Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven, when we die

Wanted it back

There was a time, that I just thought
That I would lose my mind
You came along and then the sun did shine
We started on our way
I do recall that every moment spent
Was wasted time but then I chose to lay it on the line
I put the past away
I put the past away
I put the past away
All my life, I will carry you through
All my life, between each hour of the passing days
I will stay with you

Yeah hug me baby and uh
Hear me call your name mm
Oh I know you hear me babe I
Keep on callin' your name
Well I didn't hear the answer babe
An' I don't seem to see a dog-gone thing
I'll flag me a cab and I'll
Ride around all over town oh baby
Yes I'll flag me a cab and I think I'll
Ride around all over town
You know if I don't find you woman I ain't gonna let this
Cab here no more put me down<start>I came home in the morning
And everything was gone
Oh what have I done
I dropped dead in the hallway
Cursing the dawn
Oh come on son
Why must I burn
I'm just trying to learn
I stared into the light
To kill some of my pain
It was all in vane
Cause no senses remain
But an ache in my body
And regret on my mind
But I'll be fine
Cause I live and I learn
Yes I live and I learn
If you live you will learn
I live and I learn
God kicked you in the head
So I started a fight
Cause I knew I was right
But I learned I was wrong
I remember a slaughter
I remember I fought
For the money I brought
I got blistered and burned
And lost what I earned
But I live and I learn
Yes I live and I learn
I got, I got it now
She's got, She's got it now
I came to one a corner
With some help from a man and goddamn
I don't see to have learn
That a lady in need is guilty indeed
So I paid and got laid in return
And I don't know what I've learned
Well you get what you give
And hell yes I lived
But if you live as you learn
I don't think I'd be learned
Oh with the sun in my eyes
Surprise, I'm living a life
But I don't seem to learn
No I don't think I can learn<start>I don't know the matter of my death.
In front of me the gates of hell.
It's not the end of a secret life.
It's not a dream inside my mind,
it's my destiny!
I don't remember the time
I forget I've a real name
I've lost my senses
I've fallen away.
This is not my promised land
I must be killed by someone's hands
I must find my body, I must find my grave.
I better move if my hope is to live again,
I'll sacrifice all my life to revenge.
Day after day I will kill for your glory!
Lord of the night give me my life again.
Give me your black horse to ride
To the land of the mortal time,
I'll be their lord for the eternity!
You'll be my heartblood, my king,
if it will be my destiny
I won't retire, they'll forever belong to me!
Over the seas, under the horizons
I must find the way to the heaven's gates
Oooooh! By your side I will live forever
Oooooh! By your power I'll take my revenge!
Oooooh! Through the Heaven's gates,
to the other side of death.
Will the black sun rise again?
Will the moon be the light for man
In this desert lands of existence denied?
Dark is the colour of my dreams
When you lie down in agony,
the final battle is too far from me!
I better move if my hope is to live again,
I'll sacrifice all my life to revenge.
Day after day I will kill for your glory!
Lord of the night give me my life again.
Over the seas, under the horizons
I must find the way to the heaven's gates.
How will my heart give me the power
To find the way to the heaven's gates?
Oooooh! By your side I will live forever
Oooooh! By your power I'll take my revenge!
Oooooh! Through the Heaven's gates,
to the other side of death.<start>These are days you'll remember. Never before and never since, I promise, will the whole world be warm as this. And as you feel it, you'll know it's true that you are blessed and lucky. It's true that you are touched by something that will grow and bloom in you.
These are days you'll remember. When May is rushing over you with desire to be part of the miracles you see in every hour. You'll know it's true that you are blessed and lucky. It's true that you are touched by something that will grow and bloom in you.
These are days.
These are the days you might fill with laughter until you break. These days you might feel a shaft of light make its way across your face. And when you do you'll know how it was meant to be. See the signs and know their meaning. It's true, you'll know how it was meant to be. Hear the signs and know they're speaking to you, to you.<start>(Shel Silverstein)
This is the last mornin' that I wake up in this dirty city
Looking for the sunshine as the buildings block the skies
This is the last mornin' that I wash in rusty water
Tryin' to shave a face that I don't even recognise
Down the hallway rats are skitterin'
I can smell the garbage rottin'
Hear the children cryin' in an apartment down below
This is the last mornin', that I'm gonna have to listen to it
I'm going home, yeah
This is the last mornin', that I try to breath the heavy air
Fight the crowds, avoid the traffic, watch the world turn grey
This is the last mornin' that I drink my coffee standing up
Smile and speak to strangers who just turn and walk away
This is a tough cold city here
And I'll guess I'll never cut it here
And I'm so tired of tryin' to stand against it all alone
This is the last mornin', that I'm gonna have to fight it
I'm going home, yeah
This is the last mornin' that I wear these greasy overalls
Punch the clock and do just what I'm told to get along
And face the long evenin', layin' close beside my radio
Imaginin' the kisses of the girl that sings the song
Down below the subway's screaming
As I lay here halfway dreaming
Looking at the ceiling, wondering where, the dream went wrong (where, where)
This is the last mornin', that I'm gonna have to think about it
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home

I got three or four babies sittin' on my knee
I got love waitin' for you
I come sneakin' round the corner of the avenue
You gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, or I will get you
You know you gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, before I get you
There's one thing that's on my mind
And that's getting hold of you before I serve my time
I'll keep on, with my heavy load
Till I see you come a strollin' down that open road
You gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, or I will get you
You know you gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, before I get you
I love you Ma-Ma-Ma Belle
That's why I want to get it all well I'm sure you can tell
I got, good soul, runnin' so deep
Gonna get you in the corner so that I can keep
Can't you hear me once Ma-Ma-Ma Belle
You gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, or I will get you
You know you gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, before I get you<start>Eight o'clock and it's way past time
Feelin' good I'm gonna make it tonight
It's so good when you feel this right
Out here underneath the spotlight
I'm not lonely, not lonely, not lonely
'Cause I'm doing it right
You see I put my heart in His hand, I'm a son of thunder
Underneath the spotlight
So many fall at the break of day
But I'm a winner come what may
'Cause it matters 'bout the way you choose
Choose Him and you just can't lose
It's not lonely, not lonely, not lonely
When you're doin' it right
Why don't you put your heart in His hand, be a son of thunder
Underneath the spotlight
Put yourself in my place it would be a disgrace
Left with egg all over your face
Would you come back so soon if I sang out of tune
I could be howlin' at the moon
You can see me tonight standing under the light
And I'll be singing a song that's true
Maybe someday you'll find that you're no longer blind
And the light will sing for you
Twelve o'clock and I'm on my way
Another town, it's another day
Got a message that you just can't buy
I've got to tell it and that is why
I'm not lonely, not lonely, not lonely
'Cause I'm doing it right
You see I put my heart in His hand, I'm a son of thunder
Underneath the spotlight<start>Baby, seasons change but people don't
And I'll always be waiting in the back room
I'm boring but overcompensate with
Headlines and flash, flash, flash photography
But don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee?
Style your wake for fashion magazines
Widow or a divorcee?
Don't pretend it, don't pretend
(We don't fight fair)
(We don't fight fair)
They say your head could be your prison
Then these are just conjugal visits
People will dissect us till this doesn't mean a thing anymore
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee?
Style your wake for fashion magazines
Widow or a divorcee?
Don't pretend it, don't pretend
We do it in the dark
With smiles on our faces
We're dropped and well concealed
In secret places
We do it in the dark
With smiles on our faces
We're dropped and well concealed
In secret places
We don't fight fair
(We don't fight fair)
We don't fight fair
(We don't fight fair)
We don't fight fair
We do it in the dark
With smiles on our faces
We're dropped and well concealed
In secret places
We do it in the dark
With smiles on our faces
We're dropped and well concealed
In secret places
We don't fight fair
With smiles on our faces
We're dropped and well concealed
In secret places
We don't fight fair
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
We don't fight fair
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
We don't fight fair<start>When the clock beats two and night kisses the morning
A dizzy farewell song keeps clawing my ears
The sense of my head obeys and goes alarming
But the pipers within my chest keep blowing their horns
So if you're in doubt
I'm not desperate by the hour
You know I've tried
To break this dead end of ours
And pass like a dove
But it's too late to exit from love
It's too late to pass through I really should
Well, I'm captured by a cliche?
But I can't find no door
I always waited politely to sometimes get chosen
And I've blamed my sweet little mum "I ain't no fortunate son"
For so long I've chewed these words with no chance to use 'em
For so long I've really thought I was the only one
So if I'm not
Let us share all these drunken hours
And let us fly
From the roof of this tower
To higher above
For it's too late to exit from love
It's too late to pass through I really should
Well, I'm captured by a cliche?
But I can't find no door
It's too late little baby<start>Home show, mom won't know
Run out the back door
He's passed out on the floor
Third time, been caught twice
Forgive our neighbor Bob
I think he humped the dog
But good things come to those who wait
'Cause she laid me
And mom and dad posses the key
Instant slavery
No need to explain the plan
No need to even bother
I'll pack my bags I swear I'll run
Wish my friends were 21
White lies, bloodshot eyes
Breath of alcohol, stole it from the mall
How's Chris marked with lipstick
Better call their fathers, sleeping with your daughters
But good things come to those who wait
'Cause she laid me
And mom and dad posses the key
Instant slavery
No need to explain the plan
No need to even bother
I'll pack my bags I swear I'll run
Wish my friends were 21
You don't belong
You left the kids to carry on
You planned their fall
To bad you're wrong
Don't need a mom dad slave drive song
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
Turn low the radio
I think I hear my dad
Yelling at the band
But good things come to those who wait
'Cause she laid me
And mom and dad posses the key
Instant slavery
No need to explain the plan
No need to even bother
I'll pack my bags I swear I'll run
Wish my friends were 21
You don't belong
You left the kids to carry on
You planned their fall
To bad you're wrong
Don't need a mom dad slave drive song

We were half a mile away from you, facing white, facing white
Can't have lost the sweetness of your heart
While waiting for green, waiting for green
I have grown up, you are grown and feeling stronger, feeling stronger
Memories fade but regrets just make them stay forever, last forever
I have grown up, you are grown and feeling stronger, feeling stronger
Memories fade but regrets just make them stay forever, last forever
Growing up, growing up, growing up, growing up, growing up, growing...
Everything you left me was the same as I can
Everything you wanted was the same as I can
Everything you needed was the same as I can<start>Where do I see the light?
It's all gone dead in a way
'Cos more or less I get on by
My made up thing on the day
Oh Lord, can a stone
Be ballast for an aching soul?
Just learning how to know your mind
No hiding out on the way back
To get out before I'm feeling
You just blow them all away
It's '80s life
But it all looks good on you
Suddenly police roll out
Now the hope is found in a sound
'Cos I don't wanna live a war
That got no end in our time<start>Comes the time for Christmas
And I really have to ask
If this is feeling merry
How much longer must it last
I wish a one horse open sleigh
Would come carry me away
But I've been waiting here all day
And one just hasn't come my way
Now excuse me if I'm not being reverent
But I was hoping for a miracle to hold me, wash me
Save me from my righteous doubt as I watch helpless
And everybody sings
If it's Hanukah or Kwanzaa
Solstice, harvest or December twenty-fifth
Peace on earth to everyone
And abundance to everyone you're with
Laha da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da
Comes the time for Christmas
And as you raise your yuletide flask
There's like this feeling that you carry
As if from every Christmas past
It's as if each year it grows
It's like you feel it in your toes
And on and on your carol goes
Harvesting love among your woes
I want to buy into the benevolent
And I was hoping for a miracle to hold me, wash me
Make me know what it's about
As the longing in me makes me want to sing
Noel or Navidad
Season celebration or just the end of the year
Christmas can mean anything
And I mean to keep it's hope forever near
Laha da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da da
Laha da da da da
As if a cold and frozen soul is warm to love
By loves own hand
So goes the prayer if for a day peace on earth
And good will to man
At twenty below the winter storm it billows
But the fire is so warm inside
And the children while nestled in their pillows
Dream of St. Nicholas's ride
And how the next day they'll get up and they will play
In the still falling Christmas snow
And together we'll celebrate forever
In defiance of the winds that blow
My God in heaven now I feel like I'm seven
And spirit calls to me as well
As if Christmas had made the winter warmer
Made a paradise from what was hell
As if a cold and frozen soul is warm to love
By loves own hand
So goes the prayer if for a day peace on earth
And? good will to man
At twenty below the winter storm it billows
But the fire is so warm inside
And the children while nestled in their pillows
Dream of St. Nicholas's ride
I wish a one horse open sleigh
Would come carry me away
But I've been waiting here all day
And one just hasn't come my way
Now excuse me if I'm not being reverent
But I was hoping for a miracle to hold me, wash me
Save me from my righteous doubt as I watch helpless
And everybody sings
Oh Hanukah or Kwanzaa
Solstice, harvest or December twenty-fifth
Peace on earth to everyone
And abundance to everyone you're with
All hail the savior saint
Glory to the newborn king
Peace on Earth and mercy to man
God and sinners reconciled
And hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn king
Oh, peace on earth and mercy to man
God and sinners reconciled
I wish a one-horse open sleigh
Would come carry me away
And I'll keep waiting through next May
Until Christmas comes my way<start>Dreamed I killed God, and woke up
Dreamed I killed God, and woke up
He's begging, "Please, please, please."
"No, don't..."
Dreamed I killed God and woke up
Time dries, time dries my mind
Oh, I'll survive, no one can save us
Talk to myself, talk to my soul
I want you to follow
Yes, follow...
It's only, it's only a dream, only

And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Your love has given me wings<start>You've had your fill of laughing gas
And pacing 'round the waiting room
Heard you moved into an empty house
When you broke into the girls bedroom
The daughter of a child
Said she's got the whole thing down

You know your daughter gone to ground
Do you want something to eat?
Who'd look good in Capote's hat
Are you trying to poison me?
Who said that I should ever act

And get straight
It's not our eyes
It's how we operate
You're true
You are
I'd apologize but it won't go very far
Please come here
Come right on over
And when we collide we'll see what gets left over
A little joy
A little sorrow
And a little pride so we won't have to borrow
Wherever you lead, I'll follow
Turn me inside out and upside down
And try to see things my way
Turn a new page, tear the old one out
And I'll try to see things your way
Please come here
Please come on over
There is no line that you can't step right over
Without you well I'm left hollow
So can we decide to try a little joy tomorrow
'Cos baby tonight I'll follow
Turn me inside out and upside down
And try to see things my way
Turn a new page, tear the old one out
And I'll try to see things your way
The way that we've been speaking now

'Cos all these little deals go down with
Little consequences, we share, we share

She said, "Can I help you with some information?"
'Cause your train gets out at a quarter-to-five
But you could stay a while, you and I could get funky
To the rhythm of the choo-choo-train
Dancin' in the pourin' rain
I found myself in the most beautiful situation
A feeling I can't describe
So I forget my destination
And I pray, can you make a late cancellation?
And as the train pulls out at a quarte-to-five
With a knowing sigh, her and I, we get funky
To the rhythm of the choo-choo-train
Dancin' in the pourin' rain
I found myself in the most beautiful situation
A feeling I can't describe

Oh how she gave me love, she gave me love.<start>Wasted, paralyzed
Beneath ten thousand layers of disguise
Built to save
What's left that has already worn away
Inside this vacant made-up plastic life
Only your heart survived for one last cry
One last cry, one last cry
How long, until it's my day to die
These broken animals, useless as they are
These broken animals as useless as they are
These broken animals as useless as they are
Gravity gets to me
Holds me here without release
Now's the time to cut the line
Cross my heart, I realize
Nights are long and hope is gone

Come home, it's a brand new day
Come home, my Sherri, Sherri runaway
Come on, there's a devil to pay
Come home, my Sherri, Sherri runaway
Sheri's on the run

There's something deep inside
Heartfelt that she's missing
They are no in your shoes
They are no you
Poor fools
You know it's a world of confusion
All usin' and self-abusin'
So

When I'm out having fun
The whole world seems to glisten'

"There's a fire going on
The choppers ain't detecting"
She said
"We have such simple views"
So I must see inside of you
Now that my world is changing
C'mon back, I should be celebrating
So

Hiding from authority
Sittin' in a wayside home

Duckin' in and out
Hiding from authority
Sittin' in a wayside home

Play by play, minute by minute
This is the way of life as it happens

So sad the memory, redline
Too late to build a bridge on trust

Time has come to bury me
Let time divide.<start>Esta noche crecer como hiedra trepadora
La semilla de la rosa,la flor de guaguasi.
Esta noche crecera encaramada al cielo,
Subiremos en sus hojas como alfombras voladoras
Quiero que nos subamos al cielo,
Yo quiero que nos subamos al cielo.
Quiero ver desde el aire, la tierra y el mar,
Yo no quiero morirme, yo quiero subir y poder bajar.
Yo quiero que nos subamos al cielo.
Esta noche sonaran los tambores de fiesta,
El latido enloquecido del alma de la ciudad,
Esta noche nuestras voces remontaran el viento,
Contaremos las estrellas para auyentar las penas.
Quiero que nos subamos al cielo,
Yo quiero que nos subamos al cielo.
Quiero ver desde el aire, la tierra y el mar,
Yo no quiero morirme, yo quiero subir y poder bajar.
Yo quiero que nos subamos al cielo.
Quiero ver desde el aire, la tierra y el mar,
Yo no quiero morirme,
Yo quiero subir y poder bajar.
Y esta noche crecera la semilla de luna,
Y dara de frutos otras estrellas,
Y subiremos a recogerlas.
Yo quiero que nos subamos al cielo,
Yo solo quiero que nos subamos al cielo, al cielo...<start>you can be so cold
and it hurts (me) as much as it hurts him
and i know it's partly my fault
if you had said so
son
here's my sweater
it makes you look so young
as long as we're together
it's my favorite one
and it's partly my fault
cause i've done so many things
to make you hate me
and it had nothing to do with me
now i wish you'd take it back
son
i got your letter
it makes you seem so old
and since we're not together
please come home
yes i still love you
but i guess it's unconditional

the redlights are visible
in the shadow of the door

story was over when you closed your eyes

So I wake up for the rally grab my soy milk and my gun
Breakfast with the family get the grub on see what's up
Then I saw my sister had milk in her cup
I jumped out of my chair and sprayed her with my mace
I yelled "vegan power," and I kicked her in the face
Dad was bugging, he started to run
But he's a meat eater so I pulled out my gun
Shot him in the back, then I shot his wife
That's how it's got to be in defense of all life.<start>I drew a picture I could sell
A broken image of myself
It turns around and mirrors me
Then it fade out
This empty image of myself
A different view from someone else
It turns and slowly counts to three then it fades out
Then it fades out
Why can't I be myself?
I've tried, still need someone to help me out this time
So I'll never suffocate again
This lonely bed that I have made
I pray that nothing stays the same
Forget these useless memories
Let 'em fade out
Let 'em fade out
Why can't I be myself?
I've tried, still need someone to help me out this time
Stop me from breathing you in
So I'll never suffocate again
Let me be, just let me be, let me be myself
Stop me from breathing you in
So I'll never suffocate again<start>This is the final night, boys
We are the cracks in diamond walls
I tried to illuminate but the shadows kill
I'm overshadowed
See how I blend in with nothing?
Now beautiful boys, let's destroy
We'll shine as the Lucite breaks and falls
Raise the new glitter God with the golden tears
The tears that swallow
A smile that's touched so warms nothing
Yesterday I burnt the sky
Looked to the ground and wrapped it around me
Still today I have so much to burn
Yesterday I longed to die
Fell to the ground, and the ground caught me
Now today I question why I fell, I fell
Deities fell to decoys, tainting what's pure
Let's cleanse them all, infinite life reclaimed
As the shadows kill they are overshadowed
We'll burn as they fade into nothing
Yesterday I burnt the sky
Looked to the ground and wrapped it around me
Still today I have so much to burn
Yesterday I longed to die
Fell to the ground, and the ground caught me
Now today I question why I fell
So what can help me to understand somehow
Why it always pains me to breathe?
Pains me to breathe?
We're no longer confined
Because yesterday I, I burnt the sky
We're no longer confined
Because yesterday I, I burnt the sky
Yesterday I burnt the sky
Looked to the ground and wrapped it around me
Still today I have so much to burn
To burn, to burn
Yesterday I longed to die
Fell to the ground and the ground caught me
Now today I question why I fell
I fell, I fell, I fell, because yesterday I<start>There was a time when we were young and true
We used to have so many points of view
We used to lie on the ground, kiss in the rain
The world outside kept looking in
You've got a job you said it was for me
But somehow things turned out so differently
We never lie on the ground or kiss in the rain
I don't want to stay another day
I don't want to be here without you another day
The kitchen clock is hitting half past three
Outside the world is looking happy
Funny how it can change, sunshine to rain
I don't want to spend another day
I don't want to be here without you another day
There was a time when we were young and true
We never do the things we used to do
Funny how it can change, love into pain
I don't want to spend another day
I don't want to be here without you another day<start>(Alexander)
Mama they must be crazy
'Cause I can't make heads or tales
Or someone must have lied
In your fairy tales
'Cause I tried to walk that straight line
Sweat clean to pay my bills
While every lazy, ass kissing, son of a bitch
Gets paid to say he will
Mama don't you know by now
They'll never get to me
But I'm still waiting for the truth
To set me free
Mama they must be crazy
The way they use they're stepping-stones
It's carve 'em up and throw 'em out
And disregard the bones
You try to keep your senses
You try to keep your head
While some anointed yes man
Parlays your soul to death
Mama don't you know by now
They'll never get to me
But I'm still waiting for the truth
To set me free
Mama they must be crazy
Mama they must be crazy
'Cause they weren't playing fair
"Son, shut the door behind you
And have a seat right over there"
Mama don't you know by now
They'll never get to me
But I was hoping that the truth
Would set me free
Mama they must be crazy<start>By james bracken

I fell every time.
You're the first and the last time that I'll ever try,
So dry your eyes.
I'll say goodbye.
I'll say goodbye.
I'm left hanging like all dancing bears I need rope,
To keep me in line.
I can't stop them there's more bombshells coming I choke,
More words, more lies.
I'll say goodbye.
I'll say goodbye.
I can't believe it's come to this,
I'm banging on a sinking ship,
Hoping someone hears my list.
For every trial I'll take the fall,
And never notice it no more.
What we had won't conquer all.
And while the shots still ringing out,
You do your worst to bring me down.
You do your worst to take me out.
I'll say goodbye.
I'll say goodbye.<start>Will it come to me ? will it come to me ?
And I saw you it's the hardest thing for me
I started shakin' wonderin' where could you be from
And it figures that the only thing I want is already
Taken cut him off let's get it done I know
I know will it come to me ? will it come to me ?
And I know you are the one I miss I try to figure how I get out of this I know,
I know will it come to me will it come to me?
And I know about the way you tried to tell me it was sticky
And settled in their tea so I freaked out blank stared into my heart
Just like you killed me thinkin' they're still
The key don't know how to break it to me don't know how to take it
To me will it come to me ? will it come to me ?
And I know you are the one I miss I try to figure how I get out of this I know,
Ow will it come to me ? will it come to me ?<start>You've been caught in a lie!!
You can't deny it!
So let the war begin
You're far from innocent
Hell I just don't know where it will end
You are the one to blame
You made a habit of
Fucking up my life.
Another fallacy
Is laid in front of me
Now I just don't know
What to believe
Another animal
Sent to devour what
Evers left inside
I know now!
It's all been a lie
And I'll never come to know why
I learn to discover
You're leaving me now
It's all been a lie
I don't ever want to know why
You've mastered the art of
Deceiving me now.
A mortal enemy
Has been revealed in me
How come I wasn't able to see
Another vampire
Getting their fix from
Sucking up my life
An evil entity
Had taken hold of me
Ripped out my heart and started to feed
I still remember when
I thought that all you were
Eating was my blood
I know now!
It's all been a lie
And I'll never come to know why

You're leaving me now

Something I can't bring myself to do

Believed in every word you said

Might be waiting for me up ahead

Here's the baddest little woman that I ever had
I just can't help it you've got to be mine
When she comes along, come rain or shine.
Ain't that the way love's supposed to be
We had our out and we didn't plan
Sold your love and I took my stand
A long time baby just can't be wrong
I've got that feeling and I got it strong!
Ain't that the way love's supposed to be
Love for you and me
Ain't that the way love's supposed to be, hey yeah

Before it runs aground

It would all work out in time
But here we are
And there's nothing I can do
To change your mind
Cause if I could you know I would
If I could you know I would
If I could you know I would
I circled once then twice
Before I finally found the words
The sweetest sound but nothing
That you ain't already heard
I knew the day would come
Your ship would run aground
But I know you and
There's nothing you would do
To slow it down
I wish I could slow you down
Cause if I could you know I would
If I could you know I would
If I could you know I would
I should've known
My chance was gone
The way you laughed
When first we kissed
Another round and I'd have won
But as it was it never came
Your body spoke a thousand truths
Another shade into my soul
I'm on my knees and begging now
What would it take?
I'm down on my knees
Cause if I could you know I would
If I could you know I would
If I could you know I would
Cause if I could you know I would
If I could you know I would
If I could you know I would

Once upon a time somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying fast as I can

Once upon a time we fell apart

Ohhhhh, ohhhhh!
Ohhhhh...

Once upon a time, we burn bright
Now all we ever seem to do is fight
On and on...
And on and on and on...
Once upon a time on the same side.
Once upon a time on the same side, the same game
And why'd you have to go, have to go and throw it all on my fame

I could've been a Princess, You'd be a King
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go
I could've been a Princess, You'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go

Darvaset, Vicodin, Calaudapin, sleeping pills and Nyquil.
I can't sleep yo and it's driving me mad
It's like my eyelids are glued to the top of my forehead.
I lie in bed with my eyes wide open
But Duddy don't you worry you'll be sleeping in a moment,
Then moments turn minutes and minutes turn to hours
Then hours turn to long ass nights and cold showers.
It's four in the morning still wide awake
Let's see how many bong tokes Duddy B can take.
I already drank all the alcohol left in my house so now
I sit here wide awake with a dry fucking mouth
And I just think of all the things on my mind
And then I let um roll around about a million times
Until it's got me you it grabs a hold of me baby,
It's insomnia kids you know its drivin' me crazy.
Turn out the lights, lie my head down,
I lie my head down, I close my eyes.
Now all I do girl is lie here
I think I'll die here
Insomnia.
Push my face in the pillow to asphyxiate the sound,
I'd cry my self to sleep but I'm too scared that I might drown.
I'm calling for the sandman but I don't think he's in town,
And all these sleepless nights have running thoughts have got me down.
I wish I had a sudden case of narcolepsy
Maybe call up Duddy B so we can smoke the best weed
And give me something nice so it can calm my chest peace
And talk about these things that we really don't need.
Now as I lay in bed in my head I'm running circles
Stuck in the land of low light and infomercials.
It's insomnia kids you know its drivin' me crazy
Only thing that can save me is an overdose maybe.
Turn out the lights, lie my head down,
I lie my head down, I close my eyes.
Now all I do girl is lie here
I think I'll die here
Insomnia.
Fallen fallen, trying to fall asleep.
I can't seem to 'cause my eyes are just too weak.
Fallen fallen, trying to fall asleep.
Fallen fallen 'cause my eyes are just too weak.
Turn out the lights lie my head down,
I lie my head down, I close my eyes.
Now all I do girl is lie here
I think I'll die here
Insomnia<start>With my perceptions in a mix
Down twenty miles through the sticks
To the cloudy town of hellview: population 96
Excessive vacancy, well maybe
In the shadow of an eye
All the strangers pass right through
Where the rules just don't apply
At the fork turn left a store
But on the right stay free from sight
'cause 96 quite bitter beings
Like to stack the bodies high
The only way to ever leave is
Overflooded by the storm
And entanglement in hellview
Brings you fear in fifty forms
They've deleted all the tourists
At the bottom of the lake
And not one supports the cause
To leave the blood stay in the veins
Here, three miles back is where we are
All we ever wanted was an answer
Civilized are close but way too far
All we ever wanted was an answer
Footprints giving clue to where we are
All we ever wanted was an answer
Civilized are close but way too far
All we ever wanted...<start>Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock

We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through
Love in ruins, torn apart
Victims of the careless heart
Skating on the cold grey ice
Before the flood toward the light
Muddy boots to shiny shoes
Headlines screaming out the news
From dirt and damp to hardwood floors
Beyond the burned out broken walls
I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through
I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew

50 tons of mercury dumped in the bay
It's bleeding there's no proof
That's no way to treat a good friend
Your whiskey talks louder

In artu, in place now

Big cheese is all greed
It's all relative what you need

Happy birthday here's your nerve gas

All sickly crumbling cerebellum

Looks like they're back on the street again
Mistrusted, disrupted
Rape land and kill good habit
World weary, world broken
Well spent and money, money, money, money injected, transmitted
So tons of mercury dumped in the bay

All the fisherman and their families
All sickly growing sentimental

To somewhere far and somewhere safe
So scared of this place
Cause you don't even know me
And you don't even care that I've been lonely
And tired of fighting in the den of the lions
When I won't give up trying
In the dead of the night I weep
Early morning and I still haven't got some sleep
Call me crazy, call me baby, you can call me weak
Cause you don't even know
No you don't even know
That the weight of the world on me
I've been there and back again and it seems to me
That a promise isn't something you keep
And a secret never lies it only sees what you see
Cause it's a cruel cruel ride
And if you want to come inside
You better sit up and shut your eyes
And hold on for dear life
Cause of you don't
Than you will surely lose your mind
But I won't
I wanna hide my face
I wanna find the strength to get through this
Oh I know I can do it
It's the taste in my mouth
It's the nauseousness
It's my stomach in knots forming cascades of gunshots
Leaving me holding
A pen, and this page, and these words filled with rage
In the dead of the night I weep
Early morning and I still haven't got some sleep
Call me crazy, call me baby, you can call me weak
Cause you don't even know
Cause it's a cruel cruel ride
And if you want to come inside
You better sit up and shut your eyes
And hold on for dear life
Cause if you don't
Than you will surely lose your mind
But I won't

Oh can anyone know me
Oh can anyone hear me
Oh can anyone love me
Oh can anyone, can anyone hear me

A suicidal drop out rehab advice I'll never follow
How could you do this, how could you do this to me, I'm so sorry
I'll never be the perfect son you always dreamt I'd be
So you turned your back on me
At a time when I was most in need
I'm so scared
And I guess I've learnt that life isn't always that fair
So now you want me to sign
A contract between you and I
Thought we were supposed to be family
Just give me one last try
I'll be clean this time
Two months have passed and I came home to see what the fuck was up
You called the cops on me and said son this is tough love
How could you do this, how could you do this to me, I'm so sorry
I'll never be the perfect son you always dreamt I'd be

The situation that I'm in

I want to be a spiritual person
I want to have a code of ethics
Want to have morals to live by
Fire to write the accord of my life

Monotony of the loveless

We're moving on
I'm moving on

It's time to leave it all behind
Start another life
Take a risk and fall apart
Search inside your life
How to whisper from the crowd
I'll find my own way out
I want to be
A legendary lover
I want to have
The tools to please her
Oh lay it down here
Lay it down
I'll find my own education
Learn the key to her seduction
I'm moving on
We're moving on
I'm moving on
[Chorus]
I'll find out
Find another way
I'll find out
Find another way
I'll find out
Find another way

I've tried so hard I don't know what I should do
It's all been tried,and all has failed
To bring me back to where I once fell
(Chorus)
I just want to find my way back to you
Where love is strong and feels brand new
I just want to find my way back to you
Where love is strong and feels brand new
I'm so tired that I can't fight anymore
It seems as though I've turned and shut my own door
I've prayed so hard hoping that you care
But then I turn and find you are there
(Chorus)
Yes I've been to this place before
Out on this ledge so afraid to look down
Broken down and torn
I find my way to you

In the beginning
I was alone
In the beginning, I was blind
Living in a world devoid of light
In the beginning

I was shattered
Left in pieces

Then I called you
From the darkness
Where I hide
I am made of you
I am made of you
I am made of you
I am made of you
In the beginning
You were evolution
A river of salvation

All I wanted
All I needed
Was someone to rescue me
I was drownin'
I was dying

I am made of you
I am made of you

A soul is seeking salvation to squander,
Such a beautiful burden to bear alone,
I know...
Rants and fictions of violence,
Breaking the silence,
Hiding the wake of our deception,
Guarding desperate secrets buried below,
And you know...
Tell me again your fucked up excuses,
Dying fighting a life of abuse,
When fame is your game,
You say I'm to blame,
But you know, but you know...
This moment carries my last hesitation,
Seducing anger to haste my separation,
This solemn piece of a guilty net it grows, so cold,
Your every breath now strengthens my affliction,
My tears have faded, all hope of your conviction,
You were never the martyr you pretended to be,
And you know...
Tell me again your fucked up excuses,
Dying fighting a life of abuse,
When fame is your game,
You say I'm to blame,
But you know, but you know...
Tell me again your fuckless excuses,
Holding on at the end of the noose,
When fame is your game,
You say I'm to blame,
But you know, but you know...
How they love you now,
Tear drops rain down,
Nobody cares, nobody cares,

Dying fighting a life of abuse,

We think we're okay.
We walk we talk.
Forget where we're going.
We lose our way.
We love we laugh.
We act like we're happy,

Now times have changed
so don't be fooled.
You got to remember you gotta be cool.
There's too many voices you can't control.
You better think twice before you're too old.
It's a great life if you don't weaken.
I paid a high price for all I've done wrong.
It's a great life if you don't weaken.

We feel, we touch.
We see other people
We put on a smile.
We come we go with so much frustration.
Accepting denial.

You must stand tall.
You just arrived.
Can't conquer it all.
The sun has set.
The tide's begun.
Your ship has sailed.

Just a healthy normal boy
His mama always did her best
And he was daddy's pride and joy
He learned to walk and talk on time
But never cared much to be held
And steadily he would decline
Into his solitary shell
As a boy he was considered somewhat odd
Kept to himself most of the time
He would daydream in and out of his own world
But in every other way he was fine
He's a Monday morning lunatic
Disturbed from time to time
Lost within himself
In his solitary shell
A temporary catatonic
Madman on occasion
When will he break out
Of his solitary shell
He struggled to get through his day
He was helplessly behind
He poured himself onto the page
Writing for hours at a time
As a man he was a danger to himself
Fearful and sad most of the time
He was drifting in and out of sanity
But in every other way he was fine
He's a Monday morning lunatic
Disturbed from time to time
Lost within himself
In his solitary shell
A momentary maniac
With casual delusions
When will he be let out
Of his solitary shell<start>I saw you

Wanna creepy-crawl across your town
Wanna see the shadows come to life

You don't feel
You don't fear what lies underneath
Wanna see the horns rise up and down
Wanna creepy crawl across your town
Wanna send a chill into the night
Wanna see the shadows come to life<start>I am a sailor, both stout and strong
To a goodly vessel I do belong
Well carved and anchored and well equipped
Sir William Gower's was a very fine ship
Our captain in his cabin lay
When a dreadful voice to him did say
"This night with me in the deep you'll be
So prepare yourself and your company"
The sky grew dark and the sea grew still
Bold men were fearful and the air was chill
Sir William rose to meet his men
Saying "Hear me now for I'll not speak again"
"I loved my mother when she was alive
And to my sister I gave babies five
I killed my wife and her children three
So I now must face what's come for me"
"You'll lash a timber onto my side
And throw me out on the water wide
And if I swim then let me be
But if I sink then pray for me"
So we tied his head and we tied his feet
And around his middle a winding sheet
At every knot the sea did stir
Grew ready for the murderer
And then we saw his open grave
In the likeness of a single wave
That swept our ship from her stern to her bow
And bore away Sir William Gower<start>Muffin man

The muffin man is seated at the table in the laboratory of the utility muffin
Research kitchen... reaching for an oversized chrome spoon he gathers an
Intimate quantity of dried muffin remnants and brushing his scapular aside
Procceds to dump these inside of his shirt...
He turns to us and speaks:
"some people like cupcakes better. I for one care less for them!"
Arrogantly twisting the sterile canvas snoot of a fully charged icing
Anointment utensil he poots forths a quarter-ounce green rosette (oh ah yuk
Yuk... let's try that again...!) he poots forth a quarter-ounce green rosette
Near the summit of a dense but radiant muffin of his own design.
Later he says:
"some people... some people like cupcakes exclusively, while myself, I say
There is naught nor ought there be nothing so exalted on the face of god's grey
Earth as that prince of foods... the muffin!"
Girl you thought he was a man
But he was a muffin
He hung around till you found
That he didn't know nuthin'
Girl you thought he was a man
But he only was a-puffin'
No cries is heard in the night

An actor on a barren stage and even keel with unchanneled rage
Sinking deeper into hell
Bind me to You, pierce me straight through
Consume me with Your fire
Ravage my heart, tear me clean apart
And still be my desire
As I descend it starts again sliding down, spiraling
Gasping on the breath of corruption
Fighting undertow holding on, realizing
My own hopeless helplessness finally letting go
All is madness as the flames engulf me oblivion
Refining fire making ashes of this life

Heavy about everything but my love
Swallowed hollowed
Sharp about everyone but yourself
Swallowed oh no
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and you're not
I'm with everyone and yet
Piss on self-esteem
Forward busted knee
Sick head
Blackened lungs
And I'm a simple selfish son
Swallowed followed
Heavy about everything but my love
Swallowed oh no

Makes some people go insane
While others quietly pray for rain
The's where we came from
Two boys playing in the burning sun
One with books and one with guns
Mama calls but just one comes
The other one runs
With a Christian sense of wrong and right
We were born and raised in black and white
One learned to pray, one learned to fight
We were born and raised in black and white
My brother took to the gospel road
Spent his whole life saving souls
When he looked at me and his blook ran cold
He didn't even try
I had no dreams and I had no plans
But a gun felt good in my right hand
Warden said 'how come you killed that man?'
I said 'I don't know why'
Welcome home said the hot moonlight
We were born and raised in black and white
One lives to pray, one wants to die
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white
Someone handed me a cigarette
They offered me my last request
I asked my moral soul be blessed
By someone close to me
I came to him with trembling hands
I swore I'd never understand
He said its just what life had planned
It's destiny
So don't waste your tears on me tonight
We were born and rasied in black and white
You chose the dark, I chase the light
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

While others quietly pray for rain<start>Your head might be clear
But tday my melody will stay
Close to the shore where we drive
I honour you with song
My song, I wrote it in days
But it's gonna stay forever, and ever
Where are we now, for a day
The clouds are running out of rain
Its often late and often long
But I will wait for you for now
My song, I wrote it in days
But its gonna stay forever, and ever, and ever
Its often late and often long
But I will wait for you for now
My song, I wrote it in days
But its gonna stay forever
I wrote it in days
But its gonna stay forever, and ever, and ever<start>Working in a little ice cream factory
Breathing the air in your small town
And the sun sets down on you now
Fifteen twenty or thirty people
Walking on the street
Together singing songs
And the season changes
There will be new roses
Life goes on
Here and beyond that horizon
It goes on and it changes
And it changes you too
Life goes on
Here and beyond that horizon
It goes on and it changes
And it changes you too
But they've bombed the buildings
And they have killed
You are a pregnant twenty-two year old girl
Left in tears
But your heart is full of hope
Looking in your eyes
Holding his daughter in his arms
After a year he's back
And the war was over
You were still together
Life goes on
Here and beyond that horizon
It goes on and it changes
And it changes you too
Life goes on
Here and beyond that horizon
It goes on and it changes
And it changes you too
Twenty-four years now have gone by
And it's your time to walk your way
You're a dreamer
You're a rebel
And you will suffer and you will fight
And you will sacrifice yourself
But you believed in love
Funny how your man will betray you
And in the meantime your love will save you, you see
Life goes on
Here and beyond that horizon
It goes on and it changes
And it changes you too
Life goes on
Here and beyond that horizon
It goes on and it changes
And it changes you too

Here and beyond that horizon
It goes on and it changes

Feelings he treasured most of all
The teachers and the football stars
It's in his tiny face
It's in his scrawny hands

The rhythm of the crowd
Benny and Judy down
Valentine sees it all
He's got something to say
It's Valentine's day
Valentine told me how he feels
If all the world were under his heels
Or stumbling through the mall
It's in his tiny face

I'll never give up
Never one of my dreams
Deep inside is my love is still alive
And God only knows that I can't let you go,
When I'm in love it'll be for better
I gave you my heart for ever and ever

No man can ever love you no its true

Baby, now I'm alone and I try to be strong
But my baby, I cry silent tears without pride
And I can't hold on to the feelings that's gone
And there's nothing to lose 'cause I'm playing the fool.
When I'm in love it'll be for better
I gave you my heart forever and ever.

To see a dog like you
You'd do everything in your power
To always stay brand new
You ain't worth my worries
You ain't worth my tears
It's like being stuck in a doghouse hangin' round here
There's those with futures and those with pasts
And can the tables turn your way
You're ticking down time 'til your husband asks
Why you lay around all day
You ain't worth every penny
That I ain't got
So stick around and enjoy the mess you've wrought
I don't wanna waste my time on the firing line
Waiting for the other foot to fall
I tell you honey my only crime
Was talking to you through the walls
I don't come around during waking hours
I don't come around at all these days
You can call me a thief, you can call me a coward
I knew well enough to get away
You ain't worth my worries
You ain't worth my tears
There's no farewells when you know you won't see me for a couple of years
I gotta run
Cause the day's drawin' near

Came into without a care
What they thought were cries were little laughs
Born and looking forward and moving fast
The little bundle had arrived
And I was happy to be alive
In a magic world
Long days and dreamy nights
Wide eyes taking all the sights
A little wonder goes a long, long way
Learning where to go and what to say
Say hello to your new son
Well, he sure is having fun
In a magic world
Every moment's built to last
When you're living without a past
In a magic world<start>When was it that you lost your youth or traded
It for something more for them to use so jaded
Why is it that you never said
I love you more than just a friend
I pray this gridlock never ends
And when we get there just depends
I found out recently that you are leaving
For good I hope I softly tell me ceiling
It's better now to be alive
Sleeping is my nine to five
I'm having nightmares all the time
Of running out of words that rhyme
Everything that you could never say
Would never matter anyway
I took a hammer and two nails to my eardrums long ago
Before that steak knife took my eyes
I looked up to the sky
For the last thing I would ever see
For the last time I'd cry
When was it that you sold your life or wasted
Every bite of that small slice you never tasted
I guess I should be one to talk
There's nights that I can't even walk
There's days I couldn't give a fuck
And in between is where i'm stuck
From blocks away I heard somebody screaming
That small child inside of you that you left bleeding
You stabbed him up not once but twice
Cubicles will now suffice
Some say it's the roll of the dice
I think they're wrong I know I'm right
Every breath that I could barely breathe
Could barely make it past my teeth
I took a blowtorch to both of my lungs a long, long time ago
Every step that I could take
Every one more difficult to make
Mr. Chainsaw came and took my legs a long, long time ago

Ich sass auf einem Erbsenbaum,

Ich will kein Kfer sein,

Ein Kfer, der ist winzig klein,
Du wrdest ihn bestimmt zertreten.
Ich will kein Kfer sein...
Ein Kfer kriegt nei einen Kuss,
er hat auch ziemlich kleine Ohren.
Und wenn ich schon ein Tier sein muss,
dann wr ich gern als Pferd geboren.
Ein Pferd ist grsser noch als DU,

Es gibt auch Pferde, die machen MUH,

Khe fressen Gras wie Schafe,
nur sind die Khe noch viel doofer.
Denn aus der Kuh macht man nur Vollmilch,
und aus den Schafen die Pullover.
Doch Schaf zu sein, wr mir'ne Qual,

Ich glaub', ich werd' ein Wal,
Hauptsache ist, ich werd' kein Kfer.

I was filled with disgust

You made everybody else seem insane
You filled my head with your notions
You made everybody else seem so tame
In your bed I lay reeling
You made everybody else seem a shame
I knew from the way I was feeling
Nothing could ever be quite the same
I moved straight into your shoes
I took up your cause and answered your phone
I couldn't really imagine
What life was like when I was alone
Then I started to worry (then I started to worry)
I thought of our lives left on the shelf
Too much TV and curry
Too much time spent on ourselves.
We were sitting in waiting
And I told you my plan
You were far too busy writing
Words that didn't scan
And you lent me your records
And I leant you an ear
Funny how it seems to me now
That you were never here
Never really here.
In our bed I lay reeling
You made everybody else seem insane
I knew from the way I was feeling
Nothing could ever be quite the same
It's a sign of devotion
You made everybody else seem so tame
Then it felt like going through the motions
First impressions never remain<start>Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
If you want me to, I will
And if I ever saw you

But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same
Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you

Bite the blood that drains the life inside of me and fills your soul eith love and hate and all those things you need to breathe.

Explain,why me?
This nightmare won't last long.
Are you scared?
So sing this song.
I'm right there by your side.
Tonight we've got a chance.
I watched the sky bleed grey with see-through shades of violent, bloody stains and felt the evil prime and wicked start a course straight through my veins.
I'm so alive, my skin so cold and fake.
I close my eyes,
I know that now's the time to take my chance with death and realize.
Sunrise, sunset, will you wash away the rain?
Sunrise, sunset can you wash away the pain?
This nightmare won't last long.
Are you scared?
So sing this song.
I'm right there by your side.
Tonight we've got a chance.
This nightmare won't last long.
Are you scared?
So sing this song.
I'm right there by your side.
Tonight we've got a chance.
So mute and beautiful to me,
a promise kept on high,
an angelic look at life through open eyes.
Don't be scared, we'll make it work.
We're right on time, don't make things worse.
Now I'm right there by your side.
(Sunrise) I will avenge.
(Sunset) I can't pretend.
(Sunrise) I won't forget this vain.
(Sunset) attempt and promise kept.
Just one more night to make up for the loss of love and time.
Here comes the sun to rid this world of see-through blood and swollen light.
Sunrise, sunset, will you wash away the rain? Sunrise, sunset, can you wash away the pain?
This nightmare won't last long.
Are you scared?
So sing this song.
I'm right there by your side.
Tonight we've got a chance.

pin a ribbon on my heart
if it proves i really care
pin a ribbon on the air
wearing walls within windows
where all wishes are weighed
wanted wages unwilling
while we watch on with dismay<start>Chorus:
Jesus Hitler
Adolf Christ
Is this the second coming
Or the fourth reich?
His mother a nun raped by a nazi
Near the end of the second great war
Gave birth to a son who could change the future
For better or worse he's not sure
I am what should never have been
The ultimate abomination
Have I returned to save the Jews
Or to destroy them?
Pre-Chorus:
Hear thee my fellow nazolics
Come join the neotheofacists
Keep the race pure practice eugenics
And swear to the holy swazafix
(Repeat Chorus)
I have returned
Reich und roll!
(Repeat Chorus)
Hess to my left and Peter on my right
Will it be war or peace
Totalitarian on his throne of blood
Commands both man and beast
A pair of souls trapped in the body of one
Both prisoners of reincarnation
Torn between good and evil
I have returned for salvae-elimination
(Repeat Pre-Chorus)<start>I'm stressed but you're freestyle
I'm overworked but I'm undersexed
I must be made of concrete
I sign my name across your chest
Give out the same old answers
I trot them out for the relatives
Company tried and tested
I use the ones that I love the best
Like an animal you're moving over me
Like an animal you're moving over me
When did I get perverted
I can't remember your name
I'm growing introverted
You touch my hand and it's not the same
This was so unexpected
I never thought I'd get caught
Play boomerang with your demons
Shoot to kill and you'll pop them off
Bang! Bang!
Like an animal you're moving over me
Like an animal you're moving over me
You should be sleeping my love
Tell me what you're dreaming of
You should be sleeping my love
Tell me what you're dreaming of
You should be sleeping my love
Tell me what you're dreaming of
You should be sleeping my love
Tell me what you're dreaming of
I knew you were mine for the taking
I knew you were mine for the taking
I knew you were mine for the taking
When I walked in the room
I knew you were mine for the taking
I knew you were mine for the taking
Your eyes light up
When I walk in the room
A hammering in my head don't stop
From the bullet train
From Tokyo to Los Angeles
I'm leaving you behind
A flash in the pan
A storm in a teacup
A needle in a haystack
A prize for the winning
A dead for the raising
A catch for the chasing
A jewel for the choosing
A man for the making in this blistering heat
Sweat it all out
Sweat it all out
With your bedroom eyes and your baby pouts
Sweat it all out
In our electric storms and our shifting sands
Our candy jars and our sticky hands
Sweat it all out [Repeat: x6]
Don't forget what I wrote you then
And don't forget what I told you then
And don't forget I that meant to win
And don't forget your Ventolin
So a hammering in my head don't stop
In the bullet train from Tokyo to Los Angeles.<start>Seems so far
That i have gone down this road
Only to find that it ends
But lookin' back
There is one thing that I know
I can't make it all alone again
'Cause im too weak to stand on my own
But all I need is you
[Chorus]
So lead me
Guide me
Hold me
Hide me in love
With all that you are
and all that you do
Hear me
Take me
Mold me
Break me, oh God
Just fill all of me
As i fall Into you
Just catch me as I fall
But all this time
I have felt so alone
losing myself in my despair
With loving arms
You were waiting for me to let go
With every step
you were there
'Cause I'm too weak to stand on my own
When all i need is you
(chorus)
Oh my child
How i have longed
For you to come home
to where you belong
All of your life
If you could just see
All of my joy
When you are here with me (X2)
Hear me Take me
mold me
break me, oh god
Just fill all of me
as I fall into you<start>You did your best to warn her,
she backed you in the corner
And she triend to make you say what she wanted to hear
She's a fool, it's true,
but the bigger fool is you
When you pretend to be a cripple but you're bound by fear 'cause
Grown women still play with dolls
And they bend in ways they shouldn't move
And when your arms break off,
something else breaks
And you say
"Stephanie, you can't keep pushing me,
And I know I can't get back the years you stole from me...
Oh, Stephanie, why won't you look at me?"
It was quarter to four, and on the 21st floor,
there were ten grown men spitting off the railing
And it wasnt much fun, nobody won
And in the end somebody got spit on
Boys forever have toys and games
And when they lose, they start looking for somebody to blame
And when their homes break up, something else breaks
And they say
"Stephanie, you can't keep pushing me,
And I know I can't get back the years you stole from me...
Oh, Stephanie, why won't you look at me?"<start>No quier verte... No respondo por los daos hechos!<start>Hey you
Are you in there
I'm stuck outside you, ooh
We could use
One another
Another like you, ooh
You be my passerby
I'll be your one to pass through
Screws inside
Turn so tight
Turning on you
I'm hanging on you, ooh
Me and you
Going nowhere
I'm right beside you, ooh
Me and you
Going nowhere I'm right beside you, ooh
You be my passerby
I'll be your one to pass through

'Cause that's the night that my sweetie and I
Used to dance cheek to cheek
I don't mind Sunday night at all
'Cause that's the night friends come to call
And Monday to Friday go fast
And another week is past
But Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week
I sing the song that I sang for the memories I usually seek
Until I hear you at the door
Until you're in my arms once more
Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week
Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week
I sing the song that I sang for the memories I usually seek
Until I hear you at the door
Until you're in my arms once more

Until you're in my arms once more
Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week<start>Que te vendiste, que te compran
Que te cogen, que te tienen de esclavo
Mira que culo que tuvieron estos
Putos que vivien aca al lado
Y para adentro me pregunto pato
Que es lo que habra pasado?
Que me moria por tocar rocanrol
Y ahora que puedo algunos me
Estan fusilando te la creiste
Las entradas son muy caras
Te subiste al caballo, despues los ves
Pagar el doble por un show
Que no vale 10 centavos
Es que mientras haya mundo habra
Caretas que la van a seguir boqueando, y mientras
Tanto yo sueÃ±o contra todos los que hablan
Y no viven pa' seguirla agitando
Si todo crece crecera lo bueno y
Lo malo de la mano, y en esta hoguera
De canciones y almas nos iremos quemando
Es que la gente que nos crea sueÃ±os
No creera lo que hago, porque este sÃºeÃ±o es
La razon de mi vida para seguir soÃ±ando<start>There's a girl next door to me who's round the bend
But she wonders why she can't make any friends
From her garden she could see me
In her silver-clad bikini
Singing, dancing round her fruit tree
Here we go round the lemon tree
Mister, can't you hear me
Here we go round the lemon tree
Mister, don't come near me
Could I calm her down by throwing stones at her
If only I could make the right approach to her
Think I'd rather tame a tiger
Turn those lemons into cider
Still I'd like to get beside her
Chorus
Three o'clock in the morning
I could her her toneless singing
I could smell her lemon perfume in the air
I walked up to the window
In the hope that I might see her
Could the deadly shade of night still bring her there
Chorus
Morning came and into action went my plans
Went to meet her dressed in bright green underpants
I crept in and sang discreetly
Seemed to change your mind discreetly
Danced together singing sweetly
Chorus
Chorus<start>I want somebody who sees the pointlessness
And still keeps their purpose in mind
I want somebody who has a tortured soul
Some of the time
I want somebody who will either put out for me
Or put me out of misery
Or maybe just put it all to words
And make me go, you know
I never heard it put that way
Make me say, what did you just say?
I want somebody who can hold my interest
Hold it and never let it go
Someone who can flatten me with a kiss
That hits like a fist
Or a sentence, that stops me like a brick wall
If you hear me talking
Listen to what I'm not saying
If you hear me playing guitar
Listen to what I'm not playing
And don't ask me to put words
To all the silences I wrote
Don't ask me to put words
To all the spaces between notes
In fact if you have to ask, forget it
Do and you'll regret it
I'm tired of being the interesting one
I'm tired of having fun for two
Just lay yourself on the line
And I might lay myself down by you
But don't sit behind your eyes
And wait for me to surprise you
I want somebody who can make me
Scream until it's funny
Give me a run for my money
I want someone who can
Twist me up in knots
Tell me, for the woman who has everything
What have you got?
I want someone who's not afraid of me
Or anyone else
In other words I want someone
Who's not afraid of them self
Do you think I'm asking too much?<start>There was a time for you
There was a time for me
There was a time when we were one
It's time to see through cloudy days
A time when we can find our way
Through thick and thin we still had fun
But as all those things have to change
Nothing ever remains the same
I made mistakes, you made some too
I guess there's things we just can't undo
Does this mean we're through
Now it's time to make it clear
Do you still want me here
Or would you'd rather me move on down the line
Please help me try to understand
Tell me if it's god plan
Heaven or hell only time will tell
Tell me should I stop believing
Pack my bags and just stop feeling
But baby one kiss might say farewell
Only time will tell, only time will tell
Only time will tell, only time will tell<start>You know me cos I hang around the bicycle sheds
kicking over the traces in my fancy footwear
as I go wrecking and stealing
around Tiananmen Square
I'm a Peking hooligan
I'm a social problem
I'm a Peking hooligan
I just finished at the city schools
I don't want to go back to the fields
I paid no heed to Mao's words
I heard after every meal
I'm a Peking hooligan ...<start>Doubles faces dark defense
Talk too loud but talk no sense
Yeah I see those smiling eyes
Butter us up with smiling lies
Talk to creatures raise the dead

Trained apart from houses of stone
Hour of horses pick the bone<start>I got you arrested because
Are you come or gone?
I am about to set this off
The party is done
The wine is there to keep yourself
You got it wrong
So I brought you plenty thoughts
Words were at a loss
It's a good day to skip because
The party is gonna call
The wine there to keep yourself
But don't you ever listen at all?
The parents are enforcing the law
The wine is there to keep yourself
But don't you ever listen at all?
The parents are enforcing the law<start>Hab' meine Gründe

Almost lost your mind,
And the man you love,
He hurts you all the time.
[Chorus:]
When things go wrong,
Go wrong with you,
It hurts me, too.
You love him more
When you should love him less.
I pick up behind him
And take his mess.
[Chorus]
He love another woman
And I love you,
But you love him
And stick to him like glue.
[Chorus]
Now you better leave him;
He better put you down.
Oh, I won't stand
To see you pushed around.
[Chorus]<start>Wie ein Rmer faul auf'm Sofa liegen
Damen die mit Liebe dienen
Ein feines Lcheln im Gesicht
denn eine Hand spielt am Geschlecht
Ein nackte Leib ein bischen Liebe
Sex, Suff und wilde Spiele
Vier Dominas fr mich allein

Wir sind Knige fuer einen Tag, Knige fuer einen Tag
Wir sind Knige fuer einen Tag, Knige fuer einen Tag
Knige fr einen Tag, tun und lassen was man mag

Your hand is lettin' go off mine
The night has fallen and it's stealin'
The last of our little life this time
In the arms of eternity
Twilight finds you in my arms
The mornin' finds you gone
We gotta dream forever
We have to pretend we're still in love
And I wouldn't dare try to wake you
Sleep with me, a dream in love
In the arms of eternity
Twilight finds you in my arms
The mornin' finds you gone
In the arms of eternity
Twilight finds you in my arms
The mornin' finds you gone
We gotta dream forever
We gotta pretend we're still in love
And I wouldn't dare try to wake you
Sleep with me, a dream in love
When newborn rays of sun
Dare to shine through this day
Cold virgin air is just all that remains
In my cold let darkness fall
We gotta dream forever
We gotta pretend we're still in love
I wouldn't dare try to wake you
Sleep with me, a dream in love
Sleep with me, a dream in love
Sleep with me, a dream in love<start>There is no perfect time too fast or slow, standard versus strong (? )
The truth be told you can't play much, can't play slow.
Forgive me I owe them this swollen joke.
Oozing from your throats that clutters and control.
Since you busted every window and knocked down every door
Cut up every alleyway and smoking every whore.
You turn a colder shoulder to the suture we kept close.
You turn a concrete answer into a simple yes or no, no, no, yes, no
Let's fall behind in perfect time.
Won't you stay a while? we're counting on you.
So sad to say you've gone away,
Without a trace or two.
There is no perfect time too fast or slow, standard versus strong (? )
There is no perfect time. there is no perfect place.
No picture perfect face with picture perfect clothes in picture perfect pose.
Let's fall behind in perfect time.
Won't you stay a while? we're counting on you.
So sad to say you've gone away,
Without a trace or two.
(repeat)<start>Waking up as the sun goes down
Body all in pain
Straight out the door to the worst part of town
Shooting up in vain
Slips all his money to the man
Here we go again, here we go again
Got bags of mercy in the palm of his hand
Shooting up in vain
And so he heads for the closest rooftop
And now he's free with the skyline behind
But it won't be long until his high will drop
And then you know what he'll try to find
Such a shame
Now he's back on that hunt for more
Body all in pain
Wanting to get back to where he was before
Shooting up in vain
So now he goes and sells his wedding ring
Here we go again, here we go again
But now he's sold exactly everything
Shooting up in vain
And so he heads for the closest rooftop
And now he's free with the skyline behind
But it won't be long until his high will drop
And then you know what he'll try to find
Shooting up in vain
Down to bed as the sun goes up
Body all in pain
Now he swears he's going to stop
Shooting up in vain
He's Dr. Jekyll and he's Mr. Hyde
He's got to listen to that voice deep inside
He's got a one-way ticket on a derailed train
He's got a one-way ticket on a derailed train
Shooting up in vain
Got to stop shooting up in vain
He's got a one-way ticket on a derailed train
He's got a one-way ticket on a derailed train
Got to stop shooting up in vain
He's got a one-way ticket on a derailed train<start>A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at her son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep himself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Don't go chasing waterfalls, please stick to the rivers
And the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, "Baby is good to me"
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
I told him
Don't go chasing waterfalls, just stick to the rivers
And the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls, please stick to the rivers
And the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast (moving too fast)
Moving too fast (moving too fast)
Don't go (don't go) chasing waterfalls (waterfalls), please stick to the rivers

No, anything before me

Am I someone that you adore?

There's no way of knowing.
Still I long to,
Long to know.
Hold on through it,
Pray I'll fool it,

At the rate I'm going.
Never learning,
Never close.
I will prove it,
Hold on to it,

With the chance I'll loose it.

I will know.

Far from over,
Close to nowhere.<start>As the minutes pass, I look to you
I know you're not alright
I'm past the point of thinking straight
I can only watch and cry
Don't say the words that mean the end
Don't tell me to go on
Don't leave behind an only son
To wish that you were gone
As a boy I held your hand
I never wanted you to leave
I could not ever understand
And now I'm here in disbelief
Do you have to say goodbye?
I've lived my life, knowing now
Imagining you here
Knowing what would take your life
Recounting all my tears
Did you see them then?
Did you think of how
You would tell someone
"I have to leave now"?
As a boy I held your hand
I never wanted you to leave
I could not ever understand
And now I'm here in disbelief
Do you have to say goodbye?
One step away
As a boy I held your hand
I never wanted you to leave
I could not ever understand
And now I'm here in disbelief
Do you have to say goodbye?<start>Well, I may be wrong leaving it up to you
But my love is strong, and that's what I'll do
Well, you may be right working all night and day
And I know, sometimes, I've got to get away
Get away, oo-oo-way
The walls are getting closer
People trying to freeze my soul
The times are getting harder, only wanna Rock 'N' Roll
Too much sittin', thinkin' what we're gonna say

Get away, oo-oo-way

Ever since the day he was born
He came out a little late
Maybe that's where frustration's born
My head was like a (?)
When they called me and said
"It's happened much too soon"
Took two bullets to the brain
My kid brother, he was insane
Was insane
When you find a way
Call and tell me when the time's arranged
I had no cause to be awake
The phone rang, it was 3am
Oh it was T.H.M.
Where is T.H.M.
Ever since I was born
I have felt so forlorn

I swear I'm seeing stars, are we on a shuttle?
Kiss you on the lips, we the perfect couple girl
So baby don't cry, my aye
She hotter than the sun-shine

Ain't nobody realer, she don't need no filler
High grade smooth, and every time you with her, she fill up the room
She got me on cloud 9, she hotter than the sunshine
Got me burnin' up the whole night

I just hold money, don't hold me up,

You got morning meanness, she wrote some (...)
See I be off of that tree, Weople tell me I shouldn't be
But early on my mom taught me that everything green is good for me
I wake up to 3 girls, my role model is Hugh Hef
I gave a girl a T-shirt, said she get the whole turtle-neck
I don't dance, I two-step
My weed's strong, and suplex
My socks drawers all around the crib, looking like in a movie

Two figures on my joint, one to the police

Can't explain the sunlight
Wondering why you're not home
The lighter beside you, left
Before you tried to work out all the unknowns
Blame it all on me when I forget to defend
Everything that we worked out
Something in her wording
I cannot help searching for what memory found
Thought it stopped just as its start
But that is not what you are
You're a layer on my clothes made of ivy and gold
Meet me in the hallway
Bite your lip when I say: "Never have you left my mind"
Stop and think it over, smiling, moving closer
Oh, what a delicate time
Blame it all on me when I forget to defend
Everything that we put down
Something in her wording
I guess she was just searching for some knowledge or sound
Thought it stopped just as its start
But that is not what you are
You're a layer on my clothes made of ivy and gold<start>I saw Jacob, he lay in the street
He said the air out here is like amphetamine
And I never ever wanna sleep again
I wanna live till I die
The took all his money and all that he had
But he smiled with his eyes
And his face was bright red
And spit would run from his mouth when he said
I wanna live till I die
'Cause I am alive and there's blood in my arms
This is a day that is brighter than bombs
This is a day that is brighter than bombs
I will live till I die
Till I die
There's more inside of me than skin and bones
I am born again today and
All my sins are washed away
There's more inside of me than skin and bones
Jacob sat on the roof and he said
Some day the earth will cast out its dead
If you dwell in the dust then wake up and sing
I will live till I die
Jacob smiled when he said to me
I am not waiting on the Red Sea
To open up and rain pearls on me
I will live till I die
Till I die
There's more inside of me than skin and bones
I am born again today
And all my sins are washed away
There's more inside of me than skin and bones
As long as I live and there's blood in my arms
This is a day that is brighter than bombs
This is a day that is brighter than bombs
This is a day that is brighter than bombs.<start>Well back in time with just a rhythm and rhyme
Gregorian chants were a real big thing
They took that chant and added harmony
It was a different sound
But had the same meaning
I know (I know) I know (I know)
It took us a long while
To go (to go) to go (to go)
And find us a rock style
I know (I know) I know (I know)
That we can take it one more mile
Because
We're singing that same song
We're still singing that same song
We're singing that same song
That same song
That same song
The rock of ages
Built that rockin' sound
'Til more and more people start to come around
They worshipped in church
And built that great big choir
It grew and it grew
Until it spread like fire
I know (I know) I know (I know)
It took us a long while
To go (to go) to go (to go)
And find us a rock style
I know (I know) I know (I know)
That we can take it one more mile
Because
We're singing that same song
We're still singing that same song
We're singing that same song
That same song

Since a week ago last week.
I guess maybe I should change my clothes
And wash the lipstick off my cheek.
I can't explain how all this feels.
I close my eyes and I can still see you laughing,
Singing, holding my hand, walking away.
Fading
What about me?
What about you?
What about everything we've been through?
What about the memories we boxed up?
And all the days we gave away?
What about the promises and the plans we made?
It just feels like we're giving up.
What about me?
What about you?
What about us?
I never meant for you to compromise
Or meant to hold you down.
All I ever wanted was to see you smile.
I never meant to watch you drown.
In the arms of someone a lot like a stranger,
Someone who never who never even knew himself
I guess I come undone like a
Wondering if, only thinking
What about me?
What about you?
What about everything we've been through?
What about the memories we boxed up?
And all the days we gave away?
What about the promises and the plans we made?
It just feels like we're giving up.
What about me?
What about you?
What about us?
All my life looking just like you, and
Suddenly I believe dreams came true.
Searching for an answer,
Feels like I lost I lost my keys
In a snow storm on Christmas eve
What about me?
What about me?
What about me?
What about you?
What about everything we've been through?
What about the memories we boxed up?
And all the days we gave away?
What about the promises and the plans we made?
It just feels like we're giving up.

You're talkin' about your woman

My baby's daddy must have been a millionaire
I can tell by the way she walks
When she start walkin'
The deaf and dumb begin to talk
I remember one Friday morning
We were layin' down across the bed

Knelt down and raised up his head
And said ain't she pretty

She took my heart away
She said, I've had it comin' to me
But I wanted it that way
I think that any love is good lovin'
So I took what I could get, mmh
Oooh, oooh she looked at me with big brown eyes
And said,
You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something that you never gonna forget
B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen n-n-nothin' yet
Nothin' yet, you ain't been around
That's what they told me
And now I'm feelin' better
'Cause I found out for sure
She took me to her doctor
And he told me of a cure
He said that any love is good love
So I took what I could get
Yes, I took what I could get
And then she looked at me with them big brown eyes
And said,
You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen n-n-nothin' yet

Woohoo, but I ain't seen nothin' yet
Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah

If you want to show me what I ain't seen, where I ain't been

I can see forever
On a sunny day
I used to dream for miles
Upon this hill, where we met
Under blue skies
But she said goodbye, left me behind
And now here I am
I should've won a Purple Heart
I would've got it overseas
I asked her would she be my bride
In my broken Japanese
But when I looked into her eyes
I knew that it could never be
Well, she said goodbye, left me behind
And now here I am
I should've seen it from the start
Before I went on bended knee
Her tattoo of a headless snake
Is that what she's supposed to be?
But if I had another chance
I wouldn't act so foolishly
Well, she said goodbye, left me behind
And now here I am
On a sunny day
I can see forever
On a sunny day
I can dream for miles
Upon this hill, where we met
Under blue skies
But she said goodbye, left me behind
And now here I am

Upon this hill, where we met
Under blue skies
But she said goodbye, left me behind
And now here I am<start>All alone my father raised me
Supporting us on dock worker's salary
When I was young he took my hand
At the time what he said I didn't understand
He said to me,
"Son, all the good in this world's worth fighting for
Cherish what you earn 'cause nothin' is free."
He went to the pub at the end of the day
There was something about him the people would say
I'd peer through the windows
And listen to his words so profound and true
"Boys raise your glasses and sing away!
Sing, to what bothers you."
He stood on the table and let out a cry
And the boys sang an old lullaby
Now I'm old with kids of my own
I'm still longing for that feeling of home
To make extra bread I unload F. Johnson's truck
He slipped me a shiny silver dollar, and wished me the best of luck
My wife worries we'll give the kids away to the orphanage
If we can't make more
I said, "I can't do that, because someone once told me
That this is worth fighting for."
I go to my son in bed he lie
And I began to sing my father's old lullaby
A year ago my father had passed
After years of work he could rest at last
Thousands of faces came to the funeral that day
There was something about him the people would say
At the end of the service it came no surprise
That honoring the man's life wet our dry eyes
We went to the pub at the end of the day
I said, "Boys raise your glasses and sing away!"<start>Sometimes life surprises
'Cause you never expected to be that
Dangerous disguises
That you never expect to see
Some things never change
Nothing's gonna change that
Some things you can't explain
Like why were all embracing conventional wisdom
In a world that's just so unconventional
Made you turn around
But you never expected to see that
That's what makes that sound
That you never expect to hear
Some things never change
Something's gotta change that
Some things you can't explain
Like why were all embracing conventional wisdom
In a world that's just so unconventional<start>Verse 1:
You came down from heavens throne
This earth you formed was not your home
A love like this the world had never known
...
A crown of thorns to mock your name
Forgiveness fell upon your face
A love like this the world had never known
Chorus:
On the altar of our praise let there be no higher name
Jesus, son of God
You laid down your perfect life
You are the sacrifice
Jesus, son of God
You are Jesus ,son of God
Verse 2:
You took our sin
You bore our shame
You rose to life
You defeated the grave
Love like this the world has never known
Chorus:
On the altar of our praise let there be no higher name
Jesus, son of God
You laid down your perfect life
You are the sacrifice
Jesus, son of God
You are Jesus, son of God
Bridge:
Be lifted higher than all you've overcome
Your name be louder than any other song
There is no power that can come against your love
Outro:
The cross was enough
The cross was enough
[Goto Quiet Chorus:]<start>You've been dead for years
but you never knew
and the rabid bits of time
have been eating you
but no one knows where we go
no one knows where we go
when we're dead
or when we're dreaming
( ooooh, oooh, oooh -- )
And you've been dead for years
but you never knew
and the rabid bits of time
have been eating you
no one knows where we go
no one knows where we go
when we're dead
or when we're dreaming<start>I wasn't really leaving
I was just college gone
Thought that love could last
From September to May
Got back just in time
Cause you were moving on
I thought that I could come and go
And you'd just wait
[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you now
I promise I'll make it better and I better
'Cause I've seen a world without you and I bet you
If there's a way I'll find a way somehow
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I know I've got it coming so, baby, just let it out
'Cause you're worth the price that you're making me pay
Now I don't wanna wait another minute
This is my life and I wanna spend it with you
How about you? What you say?
[Chorus]
I know we're good together
If everyone knows and everyone can see
What you do to me
I don't wanna lose you now
I promise I'll make it better, and better
And better, yes, better

He's gone North, for a while
They say that vanity got the best of him
But he sure left here in style
By the way, that's a cute hat
And that smile's so hard to resist
But what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you
She wanted a whole man, not just a half
She used to call me sweet daddy when I was only a child
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear
It's done with a flick of the wrist
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
You know a woman like you should be at home
That's where you belong
Taking care for somebody nice
Who don't know how to do you wrong
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
You know you can make a name for yourself
You can hear them tires squeal
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
You know, news of you has come down the line
Even before ya came in the door
They say in your father's house, there's many a mansions
Each one of them got a fireproof floor
Snap out of it baby, people are jealous of you
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey
Got to have done some evil deed
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
To which a scoundrel clings
Steal a little and they throw you in jail
Steal a lot and they make you king
There's only one step down from here, baby
It's called the land of permanent bliss
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?<start>i like your weakness, so much more than your strengths
send me your secrets, so i can see what the whole world thinks
i've got a guilty obsession with all your dirty confessions
i keep forgetting to mention: i've got the worst of intentions
oh darling, don't get me wrong,
i'm only leading you on
you'll get my fullest attention without your clothes on
chorus:
so is anyone out there? is anyone up?
i need some hallow satisfaction, i'm not looking for love
you've got nothing left to lose,
you've got nothing left to prove
there's only one thing left to do
so baby hit me with that picture of you
what makes you so damn afraid of who you really are?
let's see some skin for the camera,
i wanna take your digital v-card
don't be ashamed of your body when your clothes hit the floor
i want you from every angle like i was hunter moore
oh darling don't get me wrong,
i'm only leading you on
you'll get my fullest attention without your clothes on

It just ain't right
And you dance like sparks from a muzzle
And you fall like sparks from a muzzle
Welcome for the day or stay forever
There's things which we all need to navigate
Daisy chains of lights around the city now
They glow but never quite illuminate.
Hell and high water, won't stop us now
The future's twisted, righteousness is coming back around
Oh we fall like sparks from a muzzle
Unless two thousand and seven
Becomes a pitch black heaven
Oh stop acting like you're my best friend
When you don't know why and you don't care how it ends
And you dance like sparks from a muzzle
And you fall like sparks from a muzzle
Welcome for the day or stay forever
There's things that we all need to navigate
Daisy chains of lights around the city now
They glow but never quite illuminate.
So dance like sparks from a muzzle
So dance like sparks from a muzzle
And we were lit by kerosene
And we were lit by acetylene
And we walked under neon skies
You know it made me wonder why
Why all the frequencies combine
And form a cleaner, brighter light
And we filled our florescent sails
It led to sodium-scarred wailing weeks

Oh hey now now, a history of light repeat now now
Because you know it' right

To me that doesn't mean so much

You think you know just what to say
The words you use give you away
There's always something lets me know

All the best people do it
There ain't nothin' to it
Just keep turning every little thing into a lie.
Why do you always just pretend
You're gonna lose out in the end
One day you'll wake up and you'll find
That I have left you far behind.
All the best people do it
There ain't nothin' to it
Just keep turning every little thing into a lie.
You say that I am out of touch
To me that doesn't mean so much
You're tryin' hard to be so cool
But you will always be the fool.
All the best people do it
There ain't nothin' to it
Just keep turning every little thing into a lie.<start>Running down around the towns along the shore
When I was sixteen and on my own
No, I couldn't tell you what the hell those brakes were for
I was just trying to hear my song
Jimmy found his own sweet sound and won that free guitar
We'd all get in the van and play
Life became the paradox, the bear, the rouge et noir
And the stretch of road running to L.A.
Pages turning
Pages we were years from learning
Straight into the night our hearts were flung
Better bring your own redemption when you come
To the barricades of heaven where I'm from
All the world was shining from those hills
The stars above and the lights below
Among those there to test their fortunes and their wills
I lost track of the score long ago
Pages turning
Pages we were years from learning
Straight into the night our hearts were flung
Better bring your own redemption when you come
To the barricades of heaven where I'm from
Childhood comes for me at night
Voices of my friends
Your face bathing me in light
Hope that never ends
Pages turning
Pages torn and pages burning
Faded pages, open in the sun
Better bring your own redemption when you come
To the barricades of heaven where I'm from
Better bring your own redemption when you come
To the barricades of heaven where I'm from<start>Musica por: Paulo Carvalho
Eu nunca soube o que ganhar dinheiro
Desde que entrei nessa de "roquenrou"
A grana no da pra pagar a conta
Do que a gente bebe durante o show
Se eu no livrasse algum no jogo
J tava embaixo de alguma ponte
Mas mesmo assim agente faz o som
A gente toca por prazer e bom
Qualquer dia
Vamos passar a po com cerveja
E que no falte a bebida, baby
Pra que pior no seja
O visual no antigo toa
As roupas esto mesmo em farrapos
Os instrumentos so emprestados
Ns tamos todos desempregados
Eu j estou quase passando o chapu
Pra ter ao menos o da conduo
A gente no pode nem fazer greve
No tem salrio. No tem patro
Eu nunca soube o que ganhar dinheiro
Desde que inventei de ser "star"
A grana no d pra pagar a conta
E as vezes os caras no querem pagar
Se eu no livrasse algum na rua
J tava em paz de osso branco
Mas mesmo assim agente faz o som
A gente toca por prazer e bom
Sent by Carlos Andr Branco<start>If you like to gamble, I tell you, I'm your man, girl.
You win some, lose some, it's all the same to me.
The pleasure is to play, it makes no difference what you say.
I don't share your greed.
The only card I need is
The Ace of Spades,
The Ace of Spades.
Playing for the high one, dancing with the devil,
Going with the flow, it's all a game to me.
Seven or eleven, snake eyes watchin' you.
Double up or quit, double stakes or split.
The Ace of Spades.
The Ace of Spades.
You know I'm born to lose, and gambling's for fools,
But that's the way I like it, baby, I don't want to live forever.
And don't forget the Joker,
Pushing up the ante, I know you want to see me
Read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again.
I see it in your eyes, take one look and die.
The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be:
The Ace of Spades,
The Ace of Spades.<start>Just like a sunny day
Can turn all dark and gray,
This game goes on and on.
Out on the streets, broken dreams
They come so cheap
But no one can leave me for dead
'Cause I got one good fight
Left in me tonight,
And the most beautiful girl in my head.
Sometimes she comes to me in a song,
Sometimes she comes in a dream.
She's all the joy in my heart
She's everything that I see.
Days they come and days go by,
Sometimes we fight and I don't know why
I'll give it all up to her
Everything I did and said
I've got all I want now in my sight,
And the most beautiful girl in my head
Sometimes she comes to me in a song,
Sometimes she comes in a dream
She's all the joy in my heart,
She's everything that I see.<start>We're passengers in time lost in motion
Locked together day and night by trick of light
I must take another journey
We must meet with other names
Oo, we must meet with other names
You touched my heart so deeply
You rescued me, now free me
Don't watch me cry, just see me go
I'll take away the strongest feelings you will ever know
There will be no more isolation in our secret separation
You touched my heart so deeply, you rescued me
Now free me
We're passengers in time lost in motion
Locked together day and night by trick of light
I must take another journey
We must meet with other names
Oo, if only you and I be brave
You touched my heart so deeply
You rescued me, now free me
Don't watch me cry, just see me go
I'll take away the strongest feelings you will ever know
There will be no more isolation in our secret separation
You touched my heart so deeply, you rescued me
Now free me
We are matching spark and flame, caught in endless repetition
Life for life, we'll be the same
I must leave before you burn me
I'm the stranger who deserts you, only to love you in another life
There will be no more isolation in our secret separation
You touched my heart so deeply, you rescued me
Now free me
I'll bear one precious scar that only you will know again
We're passengers in time, free me
I'll bear one precious scar that only you will know again
We're passengers in time, free me
I'll bear one precious scar that only you will know again
We're passengers in time, free me<start>If I could have chosen where God would hide his heaven
I'd wish for it to be the salt and swell of the ocean
Carried by the currents to all continents' shores
Reaching into the depths where the sun's light is never shown
Mixed with algae and coral, breathed in by sharks and dolphins
Sailed by tanker ships, private yachts, swam in by tourists
Working its way up through inlets, lakes, and rivers
Swamps, and estuaries, down through limestone into the aquifer
Purified by the county, pumped through pipes and out faucets
Filled into a glass to meet the thirst of our children
And if I could have chosen, I would have been born a woman
My mother once told me she would have named me Laura
I'd grow up to be strong and beautiful like her
One day, I'd find an honest man to make my husband
We would have two children, build our home on the Gulf of Mexico
Our family would spend hot summer days at the beach together
The sun would kiss our skin as we played in the sand and water
And we would know we loved each other without having to say it
At night, we would sleep with the windows of our house left open
Letting the cool ocean air soothe the sunburned shoulders of our children<start>Please take me away
Far from this place
Leaving me here
Take me away
To the furthest star in the sky
Take me away
To the deepest cave of the night
Take me away
Voices of love, here am I
In the sad sad world of fear
Take me away
From the power of my ambition
And I'll be happy
I, I've conquered time
Where will I go?
Am I still mine?
Take me away
To the furthest star in the sky
Take me away
To the deepest cave of the night
Take me away
Voices of love, here am I
In the sad sad world of fear
Take me away
From the power of my ambition
And I'll be happy<start>I'm not going to sit here and lie and list all the many ways
About how I will supposedly love you till the end of days
Because I think that we both know in twenty-eight and a half years' time
That I won't be yours and you probably won't be mine
But yesterday, today and probably tomorrow
This little one will find it hard to find sorrow
Yesterday, today and probably tomorrow
Middleton to Withington and Middleton and back
Is more than enough to make the average Middletonian crack
So I will stand outside the Travelodge and bite my tongue
Your best friends look me up and down and I'll write the song
Yesterday, today and probably tomorrow
This little one will find it hard to find sorrow
Yesterday, today and probably tomorrow
Will they be there on Tuesday night
Running the bath and turning out the lights?
Will they be there on Thursday afternoons to welcome you home from Euston platform
With heart-shaped balloons? No
Yesterday, today and probably tomorrow<start>Well I've heard your stories about your fast trains
But now I'll tell you bout one all the travelin' folks have seen
She's the beauty of the Southland listen to that whistle scream
It's that Pan American on her way to New Orleans
She leaves Cincinnati headed down that Dixie Line
When she passes the Nashville Tower you can hear the whistle whine
Stick your hand right out the window and feel that southern breeze
You're on that Pan American on her way to New Orleans
If you're ever in the Southland and you want to see the scenes
Just get yourself a ticket on that Pan American Queen
There's Louisville Nashville Montgomery the capitol of Alabam
You pass right through them all when you're New Orleans bound
[ guitar ]
If you're ever in the Southland...
She leaves Cincinnati...<start>Speak
Don't talk about it
Speak
Don't want to know all about it
Arguing with you's no good
Well you'll be nobody's fool but you almost
Speak
Don't talk about it

That's the night I'm trying so hard to forget
All you do is you come round and then, well I remember
Remember what I try, that I, what I....
Speak
Don't talk about it
Speak
Don't want to know all about it
Anybody want tea?
Did anybody, thank you, ah fuck me
But don't speak
And don't talk about it
Don't you talk about the 32nd of December
That's the night im trying so hard to forget
All you do is you phone, then I, I remember
Remember what I try
That I, what I...
Speak
Don't wanna to talk about it
Well it was you, not I
Who was, such a stickler for manners
So don't you say goodbye
Ah no to your good old friend
Ah goodbye... Goodbye
Ah goodbye... Goodbye
Ah goodbye... Goodbye
So I'm not sure i know how to defend you
What was that, m'Lord?

Don't talk about it

But they never do
So I'll never do<start>I KNOW VICTORY

Writing in the glow of the tv static
Taking out the trash to the man
Give the people something they understand
Stick man flashing a fine-line smile
Junk bond trader trying to sell a sucker a style
Rich man in a poor man's clothes
The permanent installment of the daily dose
And you tell off when you tell it like it is
Your world's no wider than your hatred of his
Checking into a small reality
Boring as a drug you take too regularly
The apple needs to laugh; the broken crutch
The first true love that folded at the slightest touch
Brought down like an old hotel
People digging through the rubble for things they can resell
"Happy holidays," said sick savior
The leading love I still favor
I won't take your medicine
I don't need a remedy
To be everything I'm supposed to be
I don't want nobody else
I can do it by myself
We're meant to be together
Now I'm a policeman directing traffic
Keeping everything moving, everything static
I'm the hitchhiker you recognize passing
On your way to some everlasting
Better sell it while you can
Better sell it while you can
Better sell it while you can
Better sell it while you can<start>You said you was hurting, almost lost your mind,
And the man you love, he hurts you all the time.
When things go wrong, go wrong with you, it hurts me, too.
You love him more when you should love him less.
I pick up behind him and take his mess.
When things go wrong, go wrong with you, it hurts me, too.
He love another woman and I love you,
But you love him and stick to him like glue.
When things go wrong, go wrong with you, it hurts me, too.
Now you better leave him; he better put you down.
Oh, I won't stand to see you pushed around.
When things go wrong, go wrong with you, it hurts me, too.<start>Fame makes a man take things over
Fame lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame puts you there where things are hollow (fame)
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane (fame)
Fame, (fame) what you like is in the limo
Fame, (fame) what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, (fame) what you need you have to borrow Fame
Fame, (fame) it's mine, it's mine, it's just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime (fame)

She comes and goes
She breaks my heart each day
And never knows,
And the time I spend in sorrow
Will match the time I live
And the time that's left is
All I have to give.
The woman's like an ivy on a pole
She wraps her twisted love around my soul
There will come a sudden winter
When she'll seek the warmth of day
And there'll come a time when she will come to stay.
The woman's like the tide
She comes and goes
She knows the things that I can just suppose.
And the time I spend in sorrow
Will match the time that she laughs
And the songs I sing cannot explain but half.<start>The doorbell's ringing loudly.
I see my friend alone.
He sits down in a chair by the phone.
There's something behind his eyes
He's wearing a sad disguise.
I've never seen him so depressed.
And he lifts his head,
And this is what he said:
"Where can I go when I'm alone? (It's hard to know the way)
Where should I turn, How can I discern?
It's hard to know which way to go."
The front door opens gently,
Another man appears.
He brings the room such joy and cheer.
There's something behind his eyes
A love I can't describe.
The man sits down next to the other.
My friend lifts his head,
And this is what he said:
"Where can I go when I'm alone? (It's hard to know the way)
Where should I turn, How can I discern?
Do you have answers?"
The man starts to say...
"I'll never leave you all alone.
Ill never leave you all alone."<start>You don't have to look any further
I've been waiting here for you for time

Bite down, bite down into me

Ooh, I'm not gonna try
No, no, no, I'm not gonna try
Oh I'm tryna keep my composure
But every time you shake coming down I die
You've been looking
Keep looking me over
I'm tired of waving my arms in the back of the line
No one's gonna stick the pieces together for you
Together for you
No one's gonna stick the pieces together for you
Together for you
Bite down, bite down into me
Bite down, bite down into me
You better sink your teeth before I disappear
Bite down, bite down into me

When the sun is beating down upon the main street
I'll be waiting here at the station,
I gotta move down the line.
They'll be dancin' and singin' and doin' their thing
And they'll be rockin' and rollin' until the day is done.
You know I got to make the deadline.
I gotta get that southbound train tonight,
If I don't get to the border then I'll write.
The Mardi Gras will be blowing strong
And the people dancing all across the city.
I'm leaving here tonight,
Gotta move down the line.
I'm gonna catch a ride on the 9:05,
I'm gonna ride the rails until we reach the morning,
maybe three or four hundred miles.
I gotta get that southbound train tonight,
If I don't get to the border then I'll write.

Softly through the streets

Baby, I know you hate me

You make me rock solid, hot and bothered, it don't matter
I can shake you, yeah
You used to be so special
Now I'm bored all the time
You think the same of me too
Just say it don't be shy

'Cause you and I had absolutely nothing in common

And there hasn't been a tally since Sally left the alley
Since Kitty left with big pretty things have got pretty thin, yeah, yeah

Like a helicopter overhead
The letter that she left
Cold addressed in red
Tuesday came and went one
One September
When will she come again
The thing about memories
They're sure and bound to fade
Except for the stolen souls
Left upon her blade
Is Monday coming back
That's what mondays do
They turn and turn around
Afraid to see it through
Tuesday came and went
Like a helicopter overhead
The letter that she left
Cold addressed in red
Tuesday came and went one
One September
When will she come again
Tuesday came and went one
One September, when?
Cold and dressed in red
How could I forget

Like a helicopter overhead
Will she come again<start>(destinee)

The logical balance is absurd
And in this gutter town
The women they never get wet
And in this gutter town
Music is only [unverified]
And in this gutter town
Oh
So that's when I pull over a taxi-co
With my new friends from Mexico
And with limited [unverified]
We started new punk rock Parranda
(Ohh punk! Punk!)
If music doesn't come from windows
You know that something's definitely wrong
(It's fucking wrong)
And all the cars, they pass in silence
And if there is no guitar in a house
You know its owner, he cannot be trusted
And if there is no drum set in the office
Don't be surprised when the business get busted
And if your spouse doesn't play a sitar
Don't expect a whole lot of commitment
And if President doesn't play the sax
He will not get an under-table treatment
And in this gutter town
Say you kick somebody in the head
They just, they likely sue you
But man, they don't get mad
So that's when I pull over a taxi-co
With my new friends from Mexico
And with limited [unverified]
We started new samba
And in this gutter town
The logical balance is absurd
And in this gutter town
The women they never get wet<start>Take a last look around
Take the fall that is due.
And take your time,
and I'll take mine.
It's the last thing that's left for us to do
You have tried to define romance,
And all the things that it is not
Your time became some old man's cane
While he dances to a song that he forgot.
Oh, you can't throw something out there without watching it fall.
Only thing that's scarier than dying is not dying at all.
So when I have lost all my control
God will rest my soul.
I guess your mind can leave your heart.
I guess that's what you're doing now.
But it doesn't make us friends
Or better men
It is not something that love would allow.
Oh you can't throw something out there without watching it fall,
Only thing that's scarier than dying is not dying at all.
So when I have lost all my control
God will rest my soul.
And just like how I'll drink myself through my seventh relapse,
Like a captain of his sinking ship clutches to his maps.
What the figure on the cross thinks with his one final gasp-
This too shall pass.
Oh you can't throw something out there without watching it fall,
Only thing that's scarier than dying is not dying at all.
So when I have lost all my control
God will rest my soul.<start>Ya es tiempo de una involucin

tu castigo eterno me es incompatible

CORO:
**Fiestas eternas y un cielo funk**
**todas tus penas, quedan atrs.**
**Has lo que quieras, no existe el mal**

Cada vez que me tapas el sol
confirmas tu miedo a quemarte.
Algunos dicen:"Esto es lo correcto"
Para mi no existe la verdad no es ms que un chiste.
PRECORO:
*Triste no estar... en mi nube navegar*
* triste no estar... en mi nube.*
Tiempo ha pasado... no me he acostumbrado
de a poco fui moldeando... mi propia irracionalidad.
Estoy todos lo das... con la mente encendida
amo tanto la vida... y los colores que genera el sol.
Uhhh! Ahhh! en todo el mundo, soy dueo del fundo
Uhhh! Ahhh! en todo el mundo
Uhhh! Ahhh! en todo el fundo, soy el dueo del mundo

"HAY CABIDA PARA TODOS LOS ANIMALES"<start>Music: simon & garfunkel lyrics: john popper
Well, my eyes are tired and my knees are weak
And so's my soul, it's been one hell of a week
Not much else could go wrong
But damn, this could make a great song
Well, she looks into my eyes and sees only a friend
And I'm looking back seeing my world at an end
Cause I'm sure that by now she must know
You know, this ain't s bad as songs go
Well I try not to smile, and I try not to stare
And I try not to meet her eyes cause I know nothing's there
It's getting harder every day
But upon reflection, this song is okay
You see when I'm down with the blues
I try to put it to some good use
And if I could make something to play
Well, then something's come of it anyway
So at least my songs are all right
At least at the end of the tunnel there's some kind of light
And if all they do is give me something to write
As far as I'm concerned, my songs are all right
At least my songs are okay
At least they help make the pain the pain go away
And although I know I'll cry myself to sleep tonight
As far as I'm concerned, my songs are all right
My songs are all right
Well, I've got to realize that love isn't real
And all that stays with you is the pain that you feel
I don't see where I could be wrong
So I might as well finish up this song
Oh, love unrequited, so what else is new
I'm one of the many, not one of the lucky few
I've got lots of lonely friends
I bet they wish that this song would end
You see when I'm down with the blues
I try to put it to some good use
And if I can make something to play
Well something's come of it anyway
So at least my songs are all right
At least at the end of the tunnel there's some kind of light
And if all they do is give me something to write
Well, as far as I'm concerned, my songs are all right
At least my songs are okay
At least they help make the pain go away
And even though I'll cry myself to sleep tonight
Well, rest assured, my songs are all right
My songs are all right
Oh, love unrequited, so what else is new
I'm one of many, not one of the lucky few
I said I'm sick of loving her and I'm sick of telling you
I'm sick of being in pain, and I know what to do
She says we're good friends, but she's no friend of mine
I'm sick of being patient, and I'm sick of being kind
I'd love her in a big way but I know she don't care
And I'm sick of finding out that life just ain't that fair
I'm sick of being patient, and I'm sick of being kind
And I'm sick of these new thing that I'm trying to find
I'm sick of he loves her and I'm sick of she loves him
I'm sick of broken hearts and cold hearted whim
The list of what I'm sick of is so long
And finally
I'm getting sick of this song<start>La presenza dell' artiglieria
nei paesi del meridione
uniti nella lotta allo straniero
sotto il Regno delle Due Sicilie.
E i movimenti prevedibili
delle truppe in finte battaglie,
I' odore della polvere da sparo
e voci dallo stretto di Messina.
Sentimenti occulti tra noi
mi innamorai
seguendo i ritmi del cuore
e mi svegliai in primavera.
Notti bianche per i Saraceni
ch' erano di facili costumi
locande chiuse ai Greci e agli Spagnoli
nei dintorni di Catania.
E i movimenti irresistibili
dei bacini delle ragazze
vedere ballare il flamenco
era un' esperienza sensualissima.
Sentimenti occulti tra noi
mi innamorai
seguendo i ritmi del cuore
e mi svegliai in primavera.
Risveglio di Primavera.<start>i feel my life disintegrate
deep blue sky burns straight into me
i will take from you just everything, just everything
but not today, i seem to need some more time
i can not feel
i feel my life disintegrate... again
i don't know, i don't know
i feel my life disintegrate
everything around me seems so distant and pale
everyone around me tries to understand, appreciate...
everything around me seems so lost and so frail
everyone around me tries to understand, appreciate... my pain<start>And the falls and the walls you think about it
And the calls and it crawls away
And you know that there's much to do about it
And you're caught in the ricochet
Sometimes we just walk away from delirious skies
Sometimes we just want to feel so electrified
It's only, yeah it's only, to please the eyes and plague the heart
Fun flicks and the tricks you know about it
Dead bolts and the wired ways
And the times and the rhymes you knew about it
And the crimes they just fade away
Sometimes we just walk away from delirious skies
Sometimes we just want to feel so electrified
But it's only, yeah it's only, to please the eyes and plague the heart
And now I see the ones you want
And I know the ones you share
And you deceive the ones you dare
And the drift and the gift they give to you
And it turns to another day
And the mess and the stress you feel about it
It fades away
Sometimes we just walk away from delirious skies
Sometimes we just want to feel so electrified
Well it's only, yeah it's only, to please the eyes and plague the heart
Yeah, to please the eyes and plague the heart<start>I have never noticed before now
Just the same as them
I won't bother asking why or how oh no
[Cause you'll need to suffer]
So much time ticks away every minute
When you're fake
We can break
Waste away
Live a pure, insecure intuition
Always stay for your sake
So I run, I hope you understand
I've learned from my mistakes
I've learned from my regrets
I regret
Opening my eyes
I feel it drowning through the surf again
Redefining what I'm all about after you
[Live with so much nothing]
So much time ticks away every minute
When you're fake
We can break
Waste away
Live a pure, insecure intuition
Always stay for your sake
So I run
I hope you understand
I've learned from my mistakes
I've learned from my regrets
I regret
But I
[You don't know what it's like mother fucker]
And I
[You don't know what it's like to be like me]
So I run
I hope you understand
I've learned from my mistakes
I've learned from my regrets
I regret
So I run
I used to understand
The promises we make
We easily forget
I regret
But I
[You don't know what it's like mother fucker]
And I
[You don't know what it's like to be like me]<start>Each of your steps brings the end nearer
Burning eyes, hot lips, face is a picture, your dreams belong to the past and the same again
- dipping tired pale expression in the nightmare of the daily routine
You don't enjoy a rising day thus you look forward to the night
And again great pains were taken in vain
Made your touch send a chill down my spine, made your words send a chill down my spine
You mark the days off in a calendar screaming loudly - I will change everything!<start>Stone me
And may you always have no shoes
And I would rather just for you
Be the devil make you mine
And she
I know you say you hardly sleep
I make you cold I make you weak
I'll be the son of everything you hate
And come the day I'll be the king
The king of all and everything
Your saint is coming through'
You know he's going to feed on you
I've been walkin' with no shoes
Keep your mountain picnic blues
Today I'm baptizing you
Stone me
And may you always have no shoes
And I would rather just for you
Be in a taxi driving miles from here
I've been walking with no shoes
Fill my kidneys up with booze
Today I'm killing you
The stars
Who play with laughing sam goodnight
I know God is on your side
I'll be the devil
Make you, make you mine
And I could hardly wait to shoot you down
I keep you underneath my crown
A side of beef should see you off to sleep
I've been walking with no shoes
Keep your mountain picnic blues
Today I'm baptizing you<start>Melanie Banks where can you be? /
Are you doing well? Is everything alright? /
I haven't seen you since our graduation day /
Remember our crazy night /
After senior prom /
And the years keep floating by /
And we got busted by your mom /
We were naked in your pool /
Melanie / Where can you be? /
Its been so long /
I wonder if you ever think about me /
I called your mother's house today /
Melanie Banks how have you been? /
But the message said that she had moved away /
Someone told me you're living in New York again /
I still laugh about the time /
And your headlights on /
You passed out in your car /
With Mother's Milk on ten /
Just 8 words in my yearbook /
8 words was all you wrote /
And you didn't sign your name /
Just your initials and your quote<start>Whoaaaa whoaaa whoaaa whoaa whoaaaa!

I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of gray on a green Christmas tree

If you're not here with me
I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin'
You'll be do with alright with your Christmas of white
But I have a blue, blue Christmas

And when that blue heartache starts hurtin'
You'll be do with alright with your Christmas of white
But I have a blue, blue Christmas<start>I took a walk around the world
To ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere
In the sands of time
But I watched the world float
To the dark side of the moon
I feel there is nothing I can do, yeah
I watched the world float
To the dark side of the moon
After all I knew it had to be
Something to do with you
I really dont mind what happens now and then
As long as youll be my friend at the end
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman if Im alive and well
Will you be there a-holding my hand
Ill keep you by my side
With my superhuman might, kryptonite
You called me strong, you called me weak
But still your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times
I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back
On solid ground
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman if Im alive and well
Will you be there a-holding my hand
Ill keep you by my side
With my superhuman might, kryptonite
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman if Im alive and well
Will you be there holding my hand
Ill keep you by my side
With my superhuman might, kryptonite, yeah
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman if I'm alive and well
Will you be there a-holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side
With my superhuman might, kryptonite<start>Do you believe
what they told you
That it's alright
Knew you'd think so
And probably give up without a fight
The disease is the cure
if you think so
I know it's real
You were threatened
but didn't know how to feel
The time is right for sacrifice
Killed the one who couldn't breathe
Killing time don't try to fight
You made the choice to believe
The race is over but you still
Want to run
Can't get over your need to
See yourself as one
Try to reason with a dead man
Plain to see
Give way for the new man
He's a lot like me
The time is right for sacrifice
Killed the one who couldn't breathe
Killing time don't try to fight
You made the choice to believe
I've been the godsend
I've been the damned fool
But I can't be
The one who guides you<start>Remember your choice, I can hear your voice, still
You had your fill of those little reminders
Theres only bills and sleeping pills
What if theyre right? What if theyre right?
Note to self
This, this isn't living
This is merely existing
Breathe
C'mon breathe
Just breathe
It will all be better soon, you say as you cross the room
To pull up the shade, please dont, please dont for my sake
My early morning eyes, just cant take the light right now
Just cant take the life right now
So turn out the light, just close the lid and seal me in
Ill sleep for days and days on end
So turn off the light, leave me lie here in this coffin
Ill breathe only half as often, so turn out the light
This, this isn't living
This is merely existing
This, this isn't living
This is merely existing<start>Well I'm leaving tomorrow at daybreak
Catch the fastest train around nine
Yes I'm leaving the sorrow and heartaches
Before it takes me away from my mind
Send me love and I may let you see me
Send me hopes that can spin in my head
But if you really want me to answer
I can only let you know when I'm dead
When sadness fills my days
It's time to turn away
And then tomorrow's dreams
Become reality to me
So realize I'm much better without you
You're not the one and only thing in my heart
I'll just go back to pretending I'm living
So this time I'm gonna have to depart<start>Busy, busy, I'm so busy, I've got no time for you.
Sleazy, sleazy, you say I'm sleazy
for all the things I put you through.
Angry, angry, now you're angry
sick of all t games were playin'.
Sleepy, sleepy, I'm so sleepy
tired of all the things you're sayin'.
I'm so sorry, excuse me for living
I didn't know you were a psycho...
Wasted, wasted, I get so wasted
sometimes I can't get up the stairs.
Stupid, stupid, you say I'm stupid
for telling you to not be scared.
Frightened, frightened, now your frightened
you thought we were 'oh so close'.
While I'm dying, dying, slowly dying
Cause you won't leave me alone.
I'm so sorry, excuse me for living
I didn't know you were a psycho
Salute me, greet me, so glad to meet me
then you say I'm such a mess.
Well, sue me, chew me, beebopbaloo me

In the basement is where I'm going to stay
There is blood in all the things I say
Will you hate me if I stay this way?
From the bedroom, where we're running from
There's a sequel to the things I've done
You're a women, we both know it's true
By the things that I have done to you
There is blood on all the shoes you've worn
From the people you've been stepping on
There is blood in all the things you say
I won't hate you if you go away
There is blood on our hands again
From the bedroom is where we will
Bring it back to the start again
Bring it back to the love we had

In the basement is where I'm going to stay
From the bedroom, where we're running from
There's a sequel to the things I've done<start>Many fled to Zaire for the fear of being killed in the vicious,
Bloody civil war that took half a million lives
Over two milion refugees pile into neighboring countries towns
Hoping to escape their deaths but this is what they found
Bodies stacked in massive piles and mass graves overflowing
As the cholera camps are waiting for the aid to finally come
The Rwandan refugees are dying by the thousands every day
While clean water needed to preserve life is supposedly on it's way
Too little, too late
We are all responsible for the third world we create
Now we try to help these people but we're too fucking late
Too little, too late
We control the third world's fate
Our high standard of living contributes to their deaths
And the truth behind the bloodshed is what our government protects
But the fault is also ours because we're killing with our greed
For our material possessions we confuse our wants with need
The companies and the media promote these capitalist views,
Praising the American way of life, never asking at whose expense
So if you think we're helping then you're really fucking blind
Because we're after special interests and the rest we leave behind
Too little, too late
We are all responsible for the third world we create
Now we try to help these people but we're too fucking late
Too little, too late
We control the third world's fate
Haitian and Cuban refugees try to find a better life only to be denied
Entry to the United States because our government doesn't deem it necessary
To help our fellow man, so if they can't make us money
They don't want them in our land
Panama and Nicaragua were some to receive our "aid",
So what kind of difference did we make beside the loss of lives?
And how is life in BOSNIA? Did the problems disapear?
And what about Rwanda is their water now crystal clear?
Too little, too late
We are all responsible for the third world we create
Now we try to help these people but we're too fucking late
Too little, too late
We control the third world's fate<start>The night is young, my love
Lots of time for sex and drugs
Carried away my soul
Got lost in all that rock and roll
My love, the night is high
Do I walk when you can fly?
Can't stop when feeling right
When I'm with you I feel alive, feel alive
The more you roll the more you will need
The more you rock the more you will bleed, oh
The night is innocent
Sheets of black over my head
Disguise from consequence
It's time to rock and roll again
Some people say we're bold
Never live to say we're old
Look 10 years down this road
I'll still be living rock and roll, rock and roll
The more you roll the more you will need
The more you rock the more you will bleed, oh
The night is young my love
Lots of time for sex and drugs
Do I walk when you can fly?
Carried away my soul
Got lost in all that rock and roll
But that feeling only lasts so long
With thrust that it comes and its gone
The morning after runs through my veins
That rock and roll is all that keeps me sane
The more you roll the more you will need
The more you rock the more you will bleed, oh
The more you roll the more you will need
The more you rock the more you will bleed, oh<start>I found a picture of you and me
from 1989 when we
shared the world together
happy as teens could be
Life's a whirlwind and time's a whore
I pick our past up off the floor
I write these lines just in case
I don't see you no more
Maybe you're married
you've got it made
Maybe you're famous
or just get played
Maybe you showed up at our show
but maybe I will never know
[chorus]
no, I will never know
cuz' you're somewhere
where I can't go
a million miles away
or right here next to me
I've tried so many times
to find the home that once was mine
a million miles away or
right here next to me
[end chorus]
just one sign is all I want
to move on where we started from
I've tried as hard as I could try
not even sure you're still alive
what's with all that we once shared
please forgive me but I care
I scream as loud as I can scream
but you don't hear me
[chorus]
I survived our separation
but I can't wait for all time
all I need is a little information
so I can leave it behind
[chorus]<start>The other side of The Mountain
Is where I want to be
It's a far piece over The Mountain
But I hope you'll go with me
I grew up as a dreamer
I found that dreams aren't free
Now I want you here with me
I've lived so long near the mountain
It's almost part of me
I want to have it behind me
It blocks out all I can see
It looms up dark and ancient
Its shadow over me
I want it behind me
All that time, all that precious time
It's gone from you and me
We're givin' up this scene
We're givin' up this scene
Now some will say that we're destined
Some will call it fate
Me I call it obsession
It's just like love and hate
We're prisoners of our passion
We all seem to find too late
I hope it's not too late
We're givin' up this scene
Ah babe we're givin' up this scene
We're gettin' out
We're givin' up this scene
You and me baby
Yeah we're givin' up this scene
You and me baby
Yeah we're givin' up this scene<start>Today, I was gonna conquer the world
Go on ahead and make a stand
Today I saw an old friend a dyin'
And as he lay there, no one lent a hand
I'm gonna call you up
You'll forsake the one you love
Though I've left you many times before
You are just a sinner
I was the one who understands
You were my one and only man
I was lost, now I'm the winner
You stand there waitin' by the shore
But I don't come that way no more
Because you are just a sinner
Today, I was gonna hold out my hand
Reach up for that light and let it shine
Today I have no light to guide me
Feelin' like the one they left behind
So, I called you up
You left your love and took me away
Though I've left you many times before
You are just a sinner
I am the only one, you see
You were the only one for me
I was lost, now I'm the winner
You'll keep the candle burning bright
But I won't be home tonight
Because you are just a sinner
Today, I was gonna conquer the world
Go on ahead and make a stand
Today I saw an old friend a dyin'
And as he lay there, no one lent a hand<start>imagine to set one fire burn out the infection spread the ruin end the tyrrany
I saw you shut out the light tape the black fabric over your eyes
and this is the way you see there's a war going on insde me
let me go down...
your diseased hand touches my mouth
and the words and fingers rot and curl and wither
there's a hollowness that festers there let me go down...
I'm in the need to cut you to pieces.
twist the lids of your blinded vision.
I'm in the need to dismember the ruinous joints of you
I'm in the need for slaughter - I've got the taste of blood on my tongue...
picking at the skin offering no protection
I'm bared down to the wires
leave me this tarnished key to lock and silence
I need to be filled up with light
hope is sunken like my blackened eyes
I've lost this breath
withering solace

in a good mood again I'm sick of these stinky boots<start>I was going to a masquerade party
And I was searching for the one who set me free
And I found her at the masquerade party
And the devil gave my angel back to me
She was wearing the mask of a devil
And I walked up and asked her to dance with me
She said yes and I took her for my partner
And the devil gave my angel back to me
Now we're dancing like the way up in heaven
And a million stars may have our feet
Then I lifted the mask of the Satan
And the devil gave my angel back to me
Now we're dancing like the way up in heaven
Cause the devil gave my angel back to me<start>Why is everbody always pickin' on me?
The morn' that I was born my old man beat up the doctor
He clocked the doctor cause the doctor said I looked like Chewbacca
The doctor said sir you're misled sir which infers you mistook me
I did not mean your lovely wife was shackin' up with a wookie
What I mean is Wolverine is less hairy than your son
He's looks like Chewie Baba Booey Baba Booey and a Hong Kong Phooey all in one
To put it mild your new-born child's completely nutty fu-fu lookin'
I'd shove him back into the oven until he is done cookin'
But why's everbody always pickin' on me?
'Cause my fifteen-year-old cousin has less acne
But why's everbody always pickin' on me?
Ain't brushed them teeth since 1983
But why's everbody always pickin' on me?
'Cause you've got the grooming habits of a chimpanzee
But why's everbody always pickin' on me?
'Cause you're white but got a nose like Bill Cosby
Why's everbody always pickin' on me?
Always pickin' and rippin' apart poor ol' Jimmy Pop Ali
I got a schnoz like the ''cause' but there's a lot more wrong with you
So back me up Bill yea and you're ugly too
So what if I brush my teeth with a piece of cheddar cheese
Or where a fish net shirt by Chams with my Sergio Valenti jeans
And my mirror never lies but it always verifies
I got more cheese and pepperoni than a homemade pizza pie
You compare me to a Monchichi but I don't understand
Why I'm scorned like I'm deformed like the Elephant Man
And yea I took my mom to the prom but hey she asked me first
But at least this time I didn't find my date in the back of a hearse
About as popular with the girls with Englebert Humperdink
And that might be 'cause everybody calls me Shrinky Dink
I know I'm known as Polaroid I'm not a total retard
It's cause I'm done in sixty seconds and you'll still want it enlarged
But why's everbody always pickin' on me?
Cause ya wore velour flares until the late Eighties
But why's everbody always pickin' on me?
'Cause you run like a girl and sit down to pee
But why's everbody always pickin' on me?
'Cause your only school chum was the lunch lady
But why's everbody always pickin' on me?
You took your mom to the prom but got lucky
Like that episode where Gilligan gets sick of being teased
And he breaks into the Professor's lab and makes some LSD
Peaks freaks and eats the Skipper's brains then beats Ginger with coconuts
As Mr. Howell and Lovey burn alive inside their grass hut
Oh he'll kill again that Gilligan they he should of let him be
And like a postal clerk I'll go beserk if you don't stop teasing me
See the trick is only pick on those that can't do you no harm
Like the drummer from Def Leppard's only got one arm
The drummer from Def Leppard's only got one arm

Larry knows he doesn't stand a chance
Carl says hurry up and order it quick
Dave gets out to chase that chick
Dennis wonders what's under the hood
A big chrome tach and it sounds real good

Well I poured myself from this lonely bottle
My clown shoes got hung in the neck
And I dangled there in amazement
At the man who can't pay the check
Tried to trace my staggering footsteps
As they wander side-by-side
And I'm walking along to the melody
Of the wino's lullaby
Wino's lullaby, wino's lullaby,
Wino's lullaby, wino's lullaby
The path I follow, it wanders
Through laughter and liquor and song
The beautiful shows, the highs and lows
The time always seems too long
Boys and girls are all falling in love
And soaring to dizzying heights
The breakdowns, the shakedowns,
The setups, the knockdowns
Early morning under the lights
Music is my lover
My killer and my surprise
I'm playing along to the melody
Of the wino's lullaby
Chorus
Well I drag myself from the madness
And follow my heart back home
This woman's she's been waiting
And feeling awfully alone
We suffer here in the silence
As she is starting to cry
I'm falling asleep to the melody
Of the wino's lullaby
Chorus<start>When you say you do
Makes me want to spend life with you
I never knew life could be so good
When you say you care
Want to be right there beside you
And show the world
You've been good to me
And you know I do
All my love
You are my love
Without your love I go nowhere
All my love
You are my life
You are the girl I'm dreaming of
You're the one I really love
I do love you
I do love you
I do love you
I do love you
When you say it's true
Lets me know we'll be forever
Insightful joy
Of a love so good
Want to be right there beside you
And tell the world
You've been good to me
And you know I do
All my love
You are my love
Without your love I go nowhere
All my love
You are my live
You are the girl I'm dreaming of
You're the one I really love
I do love you
I do love you
I do love you
I do love you<start>One day I awakened
You left no goodbyes
You left no truth
And you left with no lies
And now it seems
That I'm paralyzed
I swam against the current
In rivers deep and wide
Oh so long - staring at the skies
And now it seems
That I'm paralyzed
I thought I had us plotted out
My chapters all revised
And now you just walk in the door
With your lips and hair and eyes
And when I see your face again
The living in me dies
The living in me dies
I had my heart down to a science
My dreams all analyzed
But here you are
With that look in your eyes
And now it seems like I'm paralyzed
And now it seems that I'm paralyzed<start>They knew all along
They're not dumb, they were so wrong
She's not always fun
Hate it now, call when I'm done
Pieces fell in place
Puzzles suck, laugh in my face
Turn and swing the pace
I'll give this, keep the good waist
Head is on
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Metronome
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Crazy TV dreams might be true
Not what it seems.
Food and cavities, chewing words
Tear at the seams
He don't feel so good, don't feel bad
Not that he should
I don't feel so good, don't feel bad
Not that I should<start>Relations are artificial; will we give it a new beginning?
Find the essence in ourselves and escape through the tunnel
Transferring spirits. The second coming
Shattering bodies and rising fire
A broken man came our way. He'd lost his harvest
Sunken, he gazed?There lies the blessing
Forthcoming shadows are unfulfilled
Striving forward and deliver innocence<start>I am locked up inside a house of solid glass
open the every look of ones who pass
moments of fantasy trade with those of void
images of repose
repress worldly toil
I can't tell the difference between what's real and dream
is this the land of riches
the path to our source?
is this the only key to unlock all doors?
or has my fantasy once again fooled me?
will these signs I see next fail to free me?
I can't tell the difference between what's real and dream
it's as if I awake from the deepest sleep
and as if the road to being seems less steep
these glassy walls that have surrounded me
break and give way for a flow of energy
the freedom I sought
and for which I have paid
strides over my strongly built barricades
the self I really am
that was once disguised
evolves to the fullest
starts it's steady rise
rids the broken pieces of my shattered past
it overcomes the fear
weight, I've lost at last
now there's just space
endlessly new to me
the flash of light enables me to see
and my view touches horizons as serene
as the source of all that I have ever dreamed<start>A painted scene view of a street
A large city, no crime, no deceit
An autumn day, pastels and grace
Buildings loom, ominous, hold them at bay
The image haunts though no one wants
Caged in serenity as freedom taunts
Always an autumn day, pastel and gray
Can't reach the buildings holding me at bay
Pay to get in, pray to get out
See the wind blows, everything's frozen
Still life of peace, a life they've chosen
Wanting the wind, the snow or the sun
Trade in freedom for a world that has none<start>I don't know how this whole business started
Of you thinkin' that I have been untrue.
But if you think that we'd be better parted,
It's gonna hurt me, but I'll break away from you.
Well, just give me the sign and I will be gone, yeah.
That's how much I feel, feel for you, baby.
How much I need, well I need your touch.
How much I live, I live for your loving.
That's how much, that's how much,
That's how much, that's how much.
I sleep alone, and late at night I'm dreamin'
Of the togetherness that seems to be leaving me.
I'd give it all and then I'd give some more
If you would only love me like you had before.
Well, take hold of my hand and all will be forgiven, yeah.
That's how much I feel, feel for you, baby.
How much I need, well I need your touch.
How much I live, I live for your loving.
That's how much, that's how much,
That's how much, that's how much.
So you try, try to stay in the middle.
And then you cry, well you cry just a little.
Then you both realize
Just how foolish you've been.
And you try to make amends
But you're better off as friends.
'Cause that's how much, that's how much,
That's how much, that's how much.
How's your life been goin' on?
I've got a wife now. Years we've been goin' strong.
There's just something that I've got to say:
Sometimes when we make love,
I still can see your face.
Ooh, just try to recall
When we were as one, yeah.
That's how much I feel, feel for you, baby.
How much I need, well I need your touch.
How much I live, I live for your loving.
That's how much, that's how much,
That's how much, that's how much.<start>( edgar allan poe )
Take this kiss upon the brow
And in parting from you now
Thus much let me avow
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night or in a day
In a vision or in none
Is it therefore the less gone
All that we see or seem
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream
I stand amid the roar
Of a surf tormented shore
And I hold within my hands
Grains of the golden sand
Oh how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep
While I weep while I weep
Oh God can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp
Oh God can I not save
One from the pitiless wave
Is all that we see or seem
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream
Dream, dream, dream ...<start>Come back to anywhere
Neither here or there
When I thought I'd never find you
There's an awful strain
But I don't want to complain
It's really not that bad
But when everyone's asleep
I'll be down in the ditches
Fighting my own war
Back on the benches
To settle that old score
But I don't want to talk
About myself anymore
I'm closing the door
I'm closing the door
With every piece and part
I played the end from the start
And even daylight won't be waiting
There can be no doubt
When the lights go out
So we'll settle this right now
Still, when everyone's asleep
I'll be down in the ditches
Fighting my own war
Back on the benches
To settle that old score
But I don't want to talk
About myself anymore
I'm closing the door
Closing the door
Sail with me forever, will you
Stand across my door?
Sail with me together would you?
I'm just tired, I'm so tired
{Standing alone so I can pull to your side
Pounding and drowning [Incomprehensible]}
Hands dance slowly over the ivory
Sinking, falling under the notes
No one needs to fight alone
I'm just tired, I'm just tired
Down in the ditches
Fighting my own war
Back on the benches
To settle that old score
I'm just tired, I'm so tired
Down in the ditches
Fighting my own war
Back on the benches
To settle that old score
But I don't want to talk
About myself anymore
I'm closing the door
I'm closing the door<start>I've got an empty feeling
Losing out so try to understand
I played a thousand games of cards
And never won a single hand
That's probably all I am
They say you win and loose
I hope I win some day
It seems no matter what you try to do
You step on someone's toes
And it gets harder every day
To recognize your friends from foes
Well I'm not feeling sorry for myself
But it might sound that way
But friends are all I got
To get me through each day
I've followed every rule they say
I made up lies, I stayed in bed
I tried to compromise instead
Don't tell me
Don't tell me why
I never thought I'd try to win
And loose it all some day
I never thought I'd try to see
I hope it's not too late<start>[jekyll]
Lost in the darkness,
Silence surrounds you.
Once there was morning,
Now endless night.
If I could reach you,
I'd guide you and teach you
To walk from the darkness
Back into the light.
Deep in your silence,
Please try to hear me:
I'll keep you near me
Till night passes by.
I will find the answer.
I'll never desert you-
I promise you this-
Till the day that I die...<start>well your arms hang parallel to the curtains
your gaze falls perpendicular to the floor
your resign yourself to the hurting
the lines in your brow are deeper than before
don't misunderstand
I just wanna be your friend
well a phone call is a phone call
is not the means to an end
your t-shirt's white across your chest
loose around your neck
your eyes come to rest on my face
indirect, there's been tears shopping here?
in the market for solutions, you know, its so hard to find clear answers
these days
I think that a thing of the past
they just don't make them to last anymore
and it seems to me I'll miss love in the effort it infers
and her legs are longer
but mine are stronger than hers
and I told you I wouldn't hold you down
I would only make you happy and I wouldn't let you drown
now you say you're submerged in me
well I'm out here writing dirges
can't you see I need to be free?
you laugh and you smile and you say you'll agree
but you continue with your kisses
oh you love those near-misses
can't you see the only thing I ask
the only slant
is the only thing you won't grant me
just turn out the light
unlock the door
tell me you feel alright, even better than before
show me you can be strong
its all I wanted all along<start>A month of Sundays, law enforced
The church's new torture is now enforced
A month of church every day
Is what they want without delay
Backed by troops, hated by people
One day you're forced towards the steeple
You're living in the shadow of death
The lightning bolt that steals your breath
The church's doors are never shut
You're always welcome in
But when will the day come
When you have to pay for them to relieve your sin?<start>Corrina's at the fashion show

All I said was that the place looks great
So please don't stop this now

Con tus ojos tan llenos despiertos
Con tu corazon lleno y radiante
Alucinante, lleno de amor
La vida la vida, la vida,que es la vida
En tratar de entenderla, se nos va la propia vida
Tan simple y tan fuerte, tan llana mente suerte
Lo que acontece, preparaciÃ³n de la muerte
Pero es absurdo ocuparte de este estudio
Cada aÃ±o,segundo a segundo
No es tan profundo, dormir soÃ±ando
Es la respuesta, tal vez es erronea
Tal vez es correcta, sueÃ±a a la par del presente y no del futuro
Porque de esto no estas tan seguro
AcÃ¡, tus enojos, existes y eres libre, afuera tus despojos
Llena tus maletas de responsabilidad
Deja para maÃ±ana tu personalidad
Mas si tu te sientes una contradicciÃ³n
Que al dormir te despiertas, y al despertar te duermes
Tal vez si lo dices no eres tan inteligente
La gente solo observa la ropa y los hechos
Mas no existe entre ellos una real conexiÃ³n
Pues siempre cree tener la razÃ³n
La razÃ³n justa y procesadora
De lo correcto que se hace cada hora
Pero en este sueÃ±o tu estas sumergido
Mas nunca te sientas nunca afligido
Porque en este sueÃ±o tu estas protegido
Y aunque te sientas un poco distante
Tu alma lo dice cada instante
La vida, la vida, la vida,que es la vida
En tratar de entenderla, se nos va la propia vida
No estoy convencido de vivir en esta vida<start>You said no commitment
When I asked you for a compromise
Just a compromise
Now I don't know why I ask you
It's always such a problem
Why make it a problem
You must be waiting for things to happen
Expecting something to happen
But nothing ever happens
Your voice raised in anger
Who knows what you're after
You don't know what you're after
You never seem to notice
The distance between us
The distance
You're only waiting for things to happen
Expecting something to happen
But nothing ever happens<start>(Exemplifying the current standards placed on United States political officials, the relaxation of many ethics has come to warp and often replace the code of conduct originally expressed in writing to protect against corruption. Once in place, a new code of ethics can be loopholed to then to another, and then to another. Change is not the culprit, instead investment in bending moral practices to suit personal and singular liberty blures the already networked and confusing practice of law and lawmaking. Not seeing the cycle, politicians all too often fall prey to the "Washington" way of life. In this way, then, traditions and attitudes are fostered in this moral enviornment. It may be stated, with a certain amount of reassurance, that a country which was founded on the idea of illegal (example b: 1) and unethical expansionism cannot prosper in a way that is beneficial to the whole of humankind. One act of terror and murder neturally leads itself to another act of retaliation. It has been theorized that that the human animal learns by example. We can look at this in a personal level; a father beats his wife, the son beats his wife, and in this way a violent cycle is founded. The truly unfortunate and important aspect of this succession is that most people believe their actions to be not only correct but inherently plausible and morally justifiable.)

I got no excuses so I wrote this song for you
Whatever the reasons did you come to say goodbye?
I'm hoping for one more try, I wanted to change your mind
So I pick up the pieces, I swallowed all my pride
I don't wanna wake up, feeling this empty inside
Did it spin you around? Did it turn you upside down?
I wonder when you found out I'm a waste of your time
So don't give up on me
I never meant to steal your smile, I haven't seen it for a while
And don't, don't give up on me
Just try to understand that I can be a better man
I tell you once just don't give up on me, yeah
I tell you once just don't give up on me
And now I feel that I'm out of place
I look for you on every stranger's face
I don't think I can do this any more
And every little things just falls apart
From the very first that day I broke your heart
It only makes me want you more and more just like before
'Cause you spin me around and now you turn me upside down
I never meant to be a waste of your time
So don't give up on me
I never meant to steal your smile, I haven't seen it for a while
And don't, don't give up on me
Just try to understand that I can be a better man

I don't want.
Waste my time.
Tell me, will it be your world,
Or will it be mine, mine, mine?
Oh, no... Tell me, are you ready like a sparrow in a hurricane?
Whoa, no... Are you prepared for a walk in the naked rain?
[Chorus]
I would crawl, you know, you know I'd swim.
I'd climb a mountain baby, I'd dive right in.
Do the monkey, do the fly.
Take a chance, on comin' back for another life,
One more time.
It's like lightning in a bottle;
Fish in a stream.
You in all your glory's;
What I need.
Dogs are in the field.
Moon floats on the lake.
This is all too good,
To be a big mistake.
[Chorus]
Oh, no... Tell me, are you ready like a sparrow in a hurricane?
Whoa, no... Are you prepared for a walk in the naked rain?
[Chorus]
One more time.
One more time.<start>Here comes the action
Here comes at last
Lord give me reaction
Lord give me your chance
You should follow me down
In satellite towns
There's no color and no sound
I've been ten feet underground
I gotta get out of this satellite town
Here comes some action
First time in my life
I gotta get up to get compensation
I gotta get up to get this to light
Whether you live alone
Or you're trying to find your way in this world
You better make sure that you don't crack you're head on that pavement, man
My God! what a shock!
It's been preying on me and mine
This is a dangerous place man
This is a dangerous place, there's nothing here.
You should follow your way down
In satellite towns
There's no color and no sound
I've been ten feet underground
In A Black and White Town
You should follow me down
There's no color and no sound
In the Black and White Town
I've been ten feet underground
In Black and White Town<start>If you were here
I could deceive you
And if you were here
You would believe
But would you suspect
My emotion wandering, yeah
Do not want a part of this anymore
The rain water drips
Through a crack in the ceiling
And I'll have to spend
My time on repair
But just like the rain
I'll be always falling, yeah
Only to rise and fall again
If you were here
I could deceive you
And if you were here
You would believe
But would you suspect
My emotion wandering, yeah
Do not want a part of this anymore...<start>Ooh, oh I've had sleepless nights
Toss and turn, wake up burning
For what you inspire
So I'm gonna walk right down your street
With a love that I can't hide
I've got one thing on my mind, yeah
I'll even sacrifice my pride
Cause I want you...
Ooh, oh how I wish you would be mine
My pulse is weak, I'm blushing brighter
Than a Valentine
Cause I've been walking down your street
With a love that I can't hide
I've got one thing on my mind, yeah
I'll even sacrifice my pride
Cause I can't stop
The way I feel
So I keep walking on
Cause I want you...<start>Here comes Brenda

Through she hasn't that much to say
She knows where the rain goes
She brakes
She brakes for rainbows
Fly Brenda

Window in the weather
Flowers in her hair
Footprints on the ceiling
How did they get there
She knows where the rain goes
She brakes

Prey on the innocent
Welcome to the rude life
Notice life where time stands still
See the other side of life
Where the poverty shows their wealth
When crime means dying
Placed to steal just to survive
Pillage and raping
Smell the stench of the rich gone poor
They wait for an answer
One day they know they're gonna pay
They've lost all their pride
They've lost their mind in a mental phase
A time will come and you will see
Approach the gutters of poverty
Stench of poor left to die
Smell the brains of a lunatic's mind
Welcome to lower existence
Prey on the innocent
Welcome to the new life
Gaze the streets
See the other side of life
Notice where time stands still
Where the poverty shows their wealth
When crime means dying
Smell the stench of the rich gone poor
Pillage and raping
Placed to steal just to survive<start>New York City, Subway Station
A million people and you were stickin' out
Smashed thumb, and so pretty
I wonder what you're all about
Crowded train, separation
But still I see you in the corner of my eye
Busy station, anticipation
For you to turn around and see me smile
And you look so trendy
Spaghetti straps and six inch soles
I just looked down and didn't see me
Are you an uptight, turn around, no esteem wreck like me?
So long SOHO
I just sat and watched you go
Take good care and always know
I'll always know that you are there somewhere
Dark hair, a fair complexion
I memorize your face and eyes
The door is open, and I don't see you
And through the window you turn and smile
And you look so trendy
Spaghetti straps and six inch soles
I just looked down and didn't see me
Are you an uptight, turnaround, no esteem wreck like me?
So long SOHO
I just sat and watched you go
Take good care and always know
I'll always know that you are there somewhere
So long SOHO
(So long SOHO)
Three vodka sevens and a J
I won't remember anything
(I just sat and watched you go)
This all just make no sense to me
For seven weeks you're in my dreams
(Take good care and always know)
Nothing's quite the same
I know your face but not your name
(So long SOHO)
I hope someday you'll hear this song
And one day I'll see you sing along
So long SOHO
I just sat and watched you go
Take good care and always know
I'll always know that you are there
So long SOHO
I just sat and watched you go
Take good care and always know
I'll always know that you are there

I wanna see you when the breaking day is dawning
You gotta go you gotta go
It's alright
But I wanna see you in the see you in the light of the morning
And when I get the same reaction
I know this time it's gonna give some satisfaction
You gotta go you gotta go

Marina misli da zna
sto sve treba da cini
u drustvu frajera
Suvise je obicna
i prazan joj je smijeh
ali nuzda me nagoni
da spavam s njom
Ref.
Dovoljno je da me vidi
da mi kaze Miki kako si
i vec se osjecam bolje
odmah je na cesti pozelim
Ja sam samo jedan
od mnogih koje zna

laskam izdaleka
Ona se na nista ne zali
o nicem nema sud
ali nuzda me nagoni
da spavam s njom
Ref.
Sinoc sam iz stosa
zazelio na tren
da bude nesto vise
da mi postane frend

negirala me skroz

Ref.<start>Marched from a burning ship into a rained out parade
With a bottle and a Bible the dregs are armed to the teeth
We traded distinction and praise for the tedious claim
That we were wed in the trenches
While college boys pine for loveless exchange
Now we carry fragments from detonated eyes
Embedded under our bones
We've spilled blood for the sake of fitting skin to the frame
But our moneys is no good here
And our memorial has veered off the road
The locals will bury my wandering eyes
At the docks of the potters field
Where the rifles of ranking men
Are equipped with 21 silencers
At 'em boys, give her the gun
At 'em boys, give her the gun
I'm the richest man in town
I'm the richest man in town
Faith, stand down give your wings
To the boredom that resurrected my soul
Crash the car if the motor won't turn over
Glory be to God
Jumped from the disloyal waves back up to the bridge
Renounced the warmth of the turbulent grave
I found blood on my lips from a covetous kiss
And I hope that my home tips its glass to it<start>Let's fall in love again
Tap the windows
And rescue our friends
How long til this makes sense
Oh, oh
Let's fall in love again
Guard the windows
And rescue our friends
How long til this makes sense
Oh, oh
It's calling out loud and it's taking over
Bleeding right out of the summer sky
It's calling out and it's taking over
We give it our all, so we don't know why
We can't slow it down
It's way too fast
Slow it down
It's way to fast
We're going on a search in some
Second hand stores
Gotta get back what we all threw away
We're going on a search in the middle of nowhere
We don't know what we're doing but we gotta just give it a go
We gotta just give it a go
Let's fall in love again
Tap the windows
And rescue our friends
How long til this makes sense
Oh, oh
Let's fall in love again
Guard the windows
And rescue our friends
How long til this makes sense
Oh, oh
Now let's sing this song again
Cause it's been messed up for years
And let's make it ours again
Desperate like rainforest trees
Straining towards broken light
All fighting for their lives
Let's something something
Cause that's where this song began
Born out of true romance
It's calling out loud and it's taking over
Bleeding right out of the summer sky
It's calling out and it's taking over
We give it our all, so we don't know why
We can't slow it down
It's way too fast
Slow it down
It's way to fast
We're going on a search in some
Second hand stores
Gotta get back what we all threw away
We're going on a search in the middle of nowhere
We don't know what we're doing but we gotta just give it a go
We gotta just give it a go
Slow it down
It's way too fast
Slow it down
It's way too fast
[x2]<start>Ramblin', where to begin
I taste the summer on your peppery skin
Been saved the warmer the waves
I felt a slip into a watery grave
My girl, linen and curls
Lips parting like a flag all unfurled
She's grand, the bend of her hand
Digging deep into the sweep of the sand
And summer arrives with a length of lights
And summer blows away
And quietly gets swallowed by a wave
It gets swallowed by a wave
Waylay, the din of the day
Boats bobbing in the blue of the bay
In deep far beneath
All the dead sailors slowly slipping to sleep
My girl, linen and curls
Lips parting like a flag all unfurled
She's grand, the bend of her hand
Digging deep into the sweep of the sand
And summer arrives with a length of lights
And summer blows away
And quietly gets swallowed by a wave
It gets swallowed by a wave
It gets swallowed by a wave
It gets swallowed by a wave<start>I wonder what we'll play for you tonight.
Something heavy or something light.
Something to set your soul alight.
I wonder how we'll answer when you say.
"We don't like you - go away"
"Come back when you've learned to play"
I wonder what we'll do when things go wrong.
When we're half-way though our favourite song.
We look up and the audience has gone.
Will we feel a little bit obscure.
Think "we're not needed here"
"we must be new wave - they'll like us next year"
The wonders don't care - we don't give a damn.<start>Don't want to be alone today
'cause I want you more than words can say.
The perfect girl, you've got to be out there,
the one who won't really even care.
If I get drunk and piss on myself
and every day I smoke a pack of cigarettes,
and I have this dream involving my guitar
and frequently take trips to the nudey bar.
But I, promise to always be true
and I would never cheat on you.
I want to be the one who takes care of you
when you're feelin blue... the perfect girl!
Give me the chance, I swear I'll make it right.
When you leave I'll kiss you good night.
The perfect girl, you know we'll never fight,
because you think it is alright
if I get drunk and piss on myself
and every day smoke a pack of cigarettes,
and have this dream involving my guitar
and frequently take trips to the nudey bar.<start>She doesn't like it too hot
She doesn't like it too cold
Room temperature!
Room temperature!<start>Well it was alright at midnight and you fell out at three
So I made you warm and stoked the dying fire
When it all came down this morning you were lying next to me
How sweet the wine of desire
Well we cheated on a friend and cheaters never win
Oh the truth I know would be a small relief
I could never be the one to say
Her best friend took you down
Gonna run in the night hide when ever it's light
Gonna run in the night like a thief
Just ain't no use think it over I was blind but now I see
Well she's coming back and I know just what I'll do
If it comes right down to you leaving her or staying here with me
How sweet the memory of you
Well we cheated on a friend and it looks like I lose again
I could never be the one to say<start>Sooner or later
You'll find him again
And he's pretty
And you're not
Thank you so much!!!
You're a doll!
Didn't you notice that she had
Her coat on
Maybe she went out
You've been talking way too loud
OOOH! Sister, don't give 'em all you got!
OOOH! So close! They have to be mine
And I wait for you in the dark<start>Anchors Aweigh my friends, I'll see you another day
I'm going away, experiences have to come
and the past has got to go
back into our dreams, back into our dreams
Anchors Aweigh my friends
Everybody understands that good times,
that good times they come and they go
and together we will always flow
back into our dreams, back into our dreams
And our troubles, we can't leave them behind
but the wind blows, and blows them all away
and the road goes...and takes them all away
...back into our dreams<start>Fun

I wonder who youre laughin with right now
I wish youd let me say what I need to say
Been tryin for weeks to track you down.
The rain pours on this painted concrete runway
As another show takes me to the sky
I wish I could fly this plane to you
Even just to say goodbye
It doesnt matter anyway
You have changed
You have changed
[x2]
I miss you, I think about your summer smile
So shocked how easy it is for you to escape closure
Yeah, you just run away, wonder if that weightll catch up to you
Youre too old to act like such a child
With a head all business and a heart unfree
Me, I still miss you, you dont even care and thats whats scarin me<start>Look all around
Can't you open your eyes
Voices are calling
Killing rain falling down from the sky
Crying with nightmare tears
Out on the street
You'll see blood on the ground
Cities are burning
Feeling the pain cutting right to your soul
Goodbye now
You're caught in his spell
Your freedom is gone
He's taken everything
You ever had
But if you're strong you'll survive
You've got to hold on
Open your eyes
[Chorus]
Behind the lies you will see
The master of insanity
Under the mask there will be
The master of insanity
Innocent minds
They're the victims of shame
Staring in sorrow
Promises lying there
Broken and crushed
Confusion-just disappear
What can you give
To be left all alone
When there's nothing at all
Your freedom is gone
He's taken everything
You ever had
But if you're strong you'll survive
You've got to hold on
Open your eyes
[Chorus]
Behind the lies you will find
He's trying to get inside you
Just open your eyes and you will see
The master of insanity
[Chorus]
Between the lies you will find
that he's trying to get inside you
Out of the night into your mind
He's always right beside you
Yeah, between the lies you will see
The master of insanity
Open your eyes or you will be
The master of insanity<start>Monsieur Dupont, he was an ordinary fellow,
Equally bad and good,
Got sick of women,
So he got into porno,
And gave to charities,
Cause he knew he should,
Never gave up on striving for the rainbow,
Mindless happiness with a healthy lawn,
Trembling with joy at the thought of a new T.V.
Under a regime of robots in authority,
Chorus
Plastic Flowers,
Laying on his grave,
From the company he gave thirty two years to
Plastic flowers,
Melting in the sun,
A memento to the glorious things he'd done
He had a car and a home on the Northside,
Respectable neighbourhood, and all his struggling to obtain riches,
Laying dead it does do him much good,
What does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and yet to lose his soul,
What does it profit a man to love little, and not be loved at all,
Chorus x2
In my life, I pray, I don't just follow blindly,
All the planned presets for me,
And without question become my enemy...(x2)
The factory people carry on without him,
Another face occupies his place,
He had friends but he never really knew them,
Such a shame that he went so young,
Above the terraces and multi storey car parks,
He will be sitting trial,
Too late to gasp out for God at his last breath,
Hoping that he's got a loop hole or two left...
Chorus
Plastic flowers, fade away....
Plastic flowers, fade away....
Plastic flowers, fade away....
Plastic flowers, fade away....<start>Water flows through rivers
As it flows through my eyes
They say a Pisces dreamer
Has lived other lives
There's something more there, I can see it clear
Not something you hold in your hand
The end of the circle
It ends with me in eternity
The poet and the dreamer
Creating Pisces flow
There is world that we possess
That all of you can't know
There's something more there, I can see it clear
Not something you hold in your hand
The end of the circle
It ended with me in eternity
Beyond just what you can see lies darkness
My life it changes with everything around me
Sometimes I need to get the hell out of here
If you are a soul in need
If you need compassion
I will stand up like a wall right by your side
I can tell what others can't tell
Yes, I can read your mind

Neptune rules my hours
Devoted by your side

I've heard it said before
Open the door, Richard
Heard it said before
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more
Now, there's a certain thing

Ooh
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll
That kind of music just soothes the soul ooh
I reminisce about the days of old
With that old time rock 'n' roll
Won't go to hear them play a tango
I'd rather hear some blues or funky old soul
There's only one sure way to get me to go

There's a train pulling out west
And a box of money stashed under the bed
Up through the pines
And down into the city of light
Where the world spins on a string
The weave of lovers weave meet their fate
Down by the sea falls in love with the sailor who keeps the light house
Storm comes in, smashes the shore
The sailor's duty comes calling
Begging and pleading as she falls to the floor
She's left waiting
She waits at the front
Her husband come wrapped around her
Where she fell the stoop in the night<start>[Music: Sipilä & CHARON Lyrics: Leppäluoto]
Scream out the word you hurt yourself
I stand behind your lies
Free all the false disguise
that opens path behind your back
Crawl down religious mind
crawl in my hate esteem
Smile face to face with death
cry your weakness out in scaffold
White seeps are killing black
it won't desetve his head to keep
Night resolves, night resolves
the light will shine so dark
Finally you realise that WATER DROWNS you
wood can burst you
Bleed in my arms, bleed in my arms
another night and I'm coming after you
[Chorus]
I'm rain that falls.
I'm wind that breezes.
I'm shadow in your night.
I'm weak.<start>The family's head gives orders

In times of civil crisis
'Allo boys! Seen any action?
Hey boys, seen any.. action?
Bond together with your mate
Against the common enemy
The Private's not born that way
The Private's not born that way
Guns take up all his time
With no job he'd be in a mess
Wanted action, gets some in<start>Never, never

Better, better, better

Let it get colder until I can't feel
Anything at all

Come on, come on
On me, on me
Touching, laughing

Watching

Let it get colder until I can't feel
Anything at all
It ebbs and flows and comes and goes
And rips you up and lets you go
It eats inside and splits your mind
As you search around for others kind
You gather strength from the depths
Fight the fight from day 'til night
This beautiful feeling soars over the skies
Moving through my body out my mind
It rises up and floods my brain
This is fucking insane
This is fucking insane
Am I still here as one with the fear
Am I still alive as one with the fear
Am I still here as one with the fear
Am I still alive as one with the fear

Del que tanto platicaban
Aquel niÃ±o inofensivo
Al que nadie respetaba
Ahora ya creciÃ³ abelito hoy si pesan sus palabras
Botellas martel y banda
Equis so pa la plevada
Una escuadra por el cinto
Por supuesto en dÃ¬amantada
Una plebe por un lado
De su gusto la muchacha
De sangre fuerte el muchacho
Tenia que ser Sinaloense
Educado y decidido
Bien ase que lo respeten
La bendiciÃ³n de su madre siempre la tiene presente
Lo mira llegar wamuchil
Al muchacho siempre al tiro
A arreglar unos negocios visitar a los amigos
Nomas sale de las vueltas
Se va pa estados unidos
Estoy bien apoderado
De respaldo esta mi tÃ­o
Y si hay algÃºn problema
TambiÃ©n cuento con mi primo
Ellos saben el camino y tropiezan muy poquito
Por el frente yo me rajo por que soy bien positivo
Y aunque todo se sacuda aquÃ­ voy en el camino
Y aunque viva en california Sinaloa me ve seguido
Si yo soy el abelito
Del que tanto platicaban
Aquel niÃ±o inofensivo

Something you know that you love.
What you, what you need is something she'll never be.
I think it's time to let you go.
Better ask the Captain.
Do it now.
Do it before we drown.
[Repeat: x2]
It's too late, it's too late
I think the tide has come to wash you out,
Wash you away from here.
Here comes the storm, it's moving in and swallowing
Like the bottom half of an hour glass
And we're running out of space.
Better ask the Captain.
Do it now.
Do it before we drown.
[Repeat: x2]
It's too late, it's too late
I think the tide has come to wash you out,
Wash you away from here.
Empty ocean is all we see,
The north star is all we need.
This time is probably right for everyone to say their goodbyes.
May day May day she said to me,
However it's too late
Captain, oh Captain, we've lost our direction.
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late.
[Repeat: x2]
It's too late, it's too late

Wash you away from here.<start>My youngest son came home today
His friends marched with him all the way
The fife and drum beat out the time
While in his box of polished pine
Like dead meat on a butcher's tray
My youngest son same home today
My youngest son was a fine young man
With a wife, a daughter and two sons
And a man he would have lived and died
Till by a bullet sanctified
Now he's a saint or so they say
They brought their young saint home today
An Irish sky looks down and weeps
Upon the narrow Belfast streets
At children's blood in gutters spilled
In dreams of glory unfulfilled
As part of freedom's price to pay
My youngest son came home today
My youngest son came home today
His friends marched with him all the way
The pipe and drum beat out the time
While in his box of polished pine
Like dead meat on a butcher's tray
My youngest son came home today
And this time he's here to stay<start>Dig up the conjo.
Breaking the mojo.
Dig up the conjo.
Making me well.
Who do you love?
You're a mess.
Got a gun to your head.
And drums in the night.
Going blind.
Hypnotized.
Lost in the congo.
Holding the bongo.
Kilimanjaro.
Dig up the conjo.
Listen to drums for the name.
Little hearts beat like saints come marching in.
Deep in the bayou.
Demon inside you.
Put on the hoo doo.
Put on the hoo doo.
Who do you love?
"Hey mommy, do you see that man? Hey mommy, I don't understand."
"It's only a zombie, honey, hailing a cab. Just hold my hand and don't look in his face."
Jungle inside you.
Something's beside you.
Doing the mambo.
Dig up the conjo.
Who do you love?
A loa down the well.
Come and ring the bell.
The jungle's burning down!
Lost in the congo.
Beating the bongo.
Dig up the conjo.
Who do you love?
To confess in the sun hold your breath.
Something comes.
It's alright.
Half alive.
Watching you while it flies.
Lost in the congo.
Beating my bongo.
Breaking the mojo.
Dig up the conjo.
Beating my bongo.
Holding the mojo.
Making me well.<start>Instrumental<start>Said you were Sophia
Should have known you by another name
I tried to be a believer babe
But I sank down in your shame
Livin' on the east side I was in the west
I tried to bring my love to you
But you trashed me like the rest
I've been haunted by your love
You gave me heartbreak
Tried to be your lover, tried to be your friend
Tried to take your pain away
Would have loved you to the end
But their ain't no use in cryin'
I will get along
Hope you find your happiness
In your misery and woe
And I hope you're cryin' all alone
You left me haunted by your love
Haunted
And when you wake you find you're still alone
Drownin' in your tears
Will you see what you have done
When the love I had for you is gone<start>They say I'll love again someday
A true love will come my way the next time
But after you there'll be never be a next time
For me
They say that I'll find happiness in someone
Else warm caress the next time
I'll soon forget your kiss
And heartaches such as this will
Just be ancient history
They say that I'm a fool to weep, that
I won't go on losing sleep the next time
And someone else will mend the heart you've
Broken in two
But how can I fall in love the next time
When I'm still so much in love
With you
When I'm still so much in love
With you<start>I wanna land on my feet
leave a hole in the street
every day
I wanna sleep on the stone
in the light all alone
every day
And in the street that's where we meet
I wanna stand on my hands
I wanna sit in the sand
every day
I wanna sleep all around
chase the light on the ground
every day
And in the street that's where we meet
And in the street dust on our feet<start>I was an idiot in utero
Somehow missed New Mexico
Fell to earth in Baltimore I know
Now they lay case in empty rooms
Birthday cards and red balloons
And me, I know, I know, I know, I know
I invited Johnny Legs and Jackie-O
Empty parties filled with people I don't know
I am rich and in the radio
I dream on my TV
Dislocation, dislocation
I'm fading out in stereo
I don't remember me
Dislocation, dislocation
Telling lies and taking shots
Getting laid in parking lots
Getting high and getting caught, I know
All my broken paper planes
Parachutes and window panes
I'm a shooting star gone novocaine, I know
So I write to all the girly magazines
Splash my passion on the pages in between
I am rich and in the radio
I dream on my TV
Dislocation, dislocation
I'm fading out in stereo
I don't remember me
Dislocation, dislocation
Rising from the afterglow
A dodo bird with polio
And me, I know, I know, I know, I know
I play with a rock and roll band on a subway
It keeps me far away from the gamma rays
We lit between the boom boom crash and the fade away,
I know
Oh co-come on wake up the congregation
We will see the light tonight
The spark the flash the bang the bite
I know, I know, I know I know know know know know know
I am rich and in the radio
I dream on my TV
Dislocation, dislocation
I could fade away in stereo
And you won't remember me
Dislocation, dislocation
If they dropped a bomb on London
Swallow LA with the sea
Dislocation, dislocation
Say a prayer for Oklahoma
Say another one for me
Dislocation, dislocation<start>I met her on the day of New Year's Eve
I was shopping for a wedding gift on Buena Vista Street
I swear I saw the fire in her eyes
The kind of girl you hear about but never see in real life
Everyone needs something, everyone wants love
She's lying in my bed in just her underwear
She's laughing at the words I say
Yeah, we're kissing and we're touching
Underneath the covers listening to my thinking
I hear her whispering I love you
Right before I fall asleep
A boy can dream, dream, dream
A boy can dream, dream, dream
A boy can dream, dream, dream
A boy can dream, dream, dream
Now I woke up on Sunday afternoon
I had to drive back, I was hoping I would see her soon
It's something about the way she looked at me
She keeps playing in my head like a broken record on repeat
Everyone needs something, everyone wants love
She's lying in my bed in just her underwear
She's laughing at the words I say
Yeah, we're kissing and we're touching
Underneath the covers listening to my thinking
I hear her whispering I love you
Right before I fall asleep
A boy can dream, dream, dream
A boy can dream, dream, dream
A boy can dream, dream, dream
A boy can dream, dream, dream
If only I had a number, I know later on tonight
She'd be lying in my bed in just her underwear
She's laughing at the words I say
Yeah, we're kissing and we're touching
Underneath the covers listening to my thinking
I hear her whispering I love you
Right before I fall asleep
Yeah a boy can dream, dream, dream
Oh, a boy can dream, dream, dream
Oh, I met her on the day of New Year's Ever<start>Don't expect me to treat you like a lady
I may not always show respect
It's too soon, yet I hardly even know you
That's just my way, don't get upset, [Incomprehensible]
Uptill now I've been living like a loner
Gettin' by, ooh, just gettin' by
And this heart of mine has only had one owner
But you could change that if you tried, baby
Now I don't want a love forever
And I don't need a master plan
I just want to come together
And I want you to understand
It's the moment of truth and it's finally come this time
Now we must draw the line
The moment of truth, this time it's everything
Open up, let me in, let me right into your heart, oh yeah
I intend to treat you like a woman
'Cause I can see you're not a child
'Cause you've got that look, that certain way of knowin'
It's got my senses runnin' wild, oh yeah

Tell me where the light's gonna come from now
Is it you, was it me?
Fallin' out of hope, tightrope
After all baby, you should know not to be the cramp
All the talks by the fork, fallin', love is a high wire act
We've got to get our balance back
And I know we can still do that
If you don't look down
(Don't look down)
Don't fear now
(Don't fear now)
We've already lost our way
The memory of yesterday
Is still strong enough to light the way
Don't look down
(Don't look down)
We can rebound
(We can rebound)
Whatever may lie ahead
Keep your eyes on me now
And baby, don't look down
A starry sky, a lullaby
Is all we need to fortify
What is weakening
Wasn't you, it was me
Running to get out or walk back in
I wanna end all this suffering
I do believe a second chance is coming
Love is a high wire act, got to be an acrobat
And I know you can still be that
If you don't look down
(Don't look down)
Don't fear now
(Don't fear now)
We've already lost our way
The memory of yesterday
Is still strong enough to light the way
Don't look down

We can rebound

Whatever may lie ahead
Keep your eyes on me now
And baby, don't look down
Don't listen to the crowd
I know the sky is ominous and stormy
(Stormy)
I know it's hard to find your shelter here
Inside you feel it's too far to be falling
(Falling)
But baby, don't your fear
If you don't look down
(Don't look down, you should never look down)
Don't fear now
(Don't fear now, you should never fear now)
We've already lost our way
The memory of yesterday
Is still strong enough to light the way
Don't look down

We can rebound

Whatever may lie ahead
Keep your eyes on me now
And baby, don't look down

Time to walk 
Time to run 
Time to aim your arrows

Like some big old bird so fat that he just can't fly
Far be it from me to be overreacting
My body hurts like hell and all I can do is wonder why
Like I'm in prison, my mind is occupied with busting out
When our sleeper has risen
Said what are these walking blues about
Hey peter pan come play with me
Please forget your lessons
The wind is warm outside
The breeze is blowing fast and free
I don't seem to care that much
But now when you're waiting for mama, says she
"right now my mind is wandering up with the wind, just peter pan and me."
Without being artistic, I prefer to trust my heart again
It seems so sadistic, to try to write down
When I'm walking out again
Well, well well well, welcome aboard to the rest of your life
This is it, you're really in it now, good luck and good-bye
And oh look, there goes a youth, watch options fade to mist
That's all right, baby, you'll do fine, baby, it's so hard
Terribly hard, terribly hard, terribly hard...
To exist
You know how I tend to feel when nothing's happening
Like some big old bird so fat that he just can't fly
Far be it for me to be overreacting
My body hurts like hell and all I can do is wonder why
Like I'm in prison, my mind is occupied with busting out
When the sleepers have risen
Said what are these walking blues about
Terribly hard, terribly hard, terribly hard...
So hard<start>People say I'm the laugh of the party
Cuz I have a joke or two
Ooh no, I might be laugh loud and hardy
Keep inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You see my smile, looks out of place
And if you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, I need you yeah
Since you left me, if you see me with another girl
Seams just like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute she's just a search for you
Because you're the palmer and wise
So take a good look at my face
You see my smile, looks out of place
And if you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, I need you
A sat, a masquerade, inside my hope is fadin'
Just to claim, since yeah, you put me down
My spot is my makeup, I wax since my brake up
With you, oh yeah
Just take a good look at my face
You see my smile, looks out of place
And if you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, I need you
Just take a good look at my face
You see my smile, looks out of place
And if you look closer, closer you'll see it's just a trace
The tracks of my tears

It's not so hard
Took a long time to get here
We came from so far
And if I had it all to do again
I wouldn't change a thing

At the age of temptation
You were so young then
I was looking for relation
You were looking for a friend
And your hair was long just like now
In the room we fell into
And I still want you
Love in the altitudes, no one but me and you
I've seen the pages, the haunting lie
Someone discouraging me
They said you'll lose interest
And you'll get tired of me
But I ain't worried, you know it girl
It's been so long it seems
And I still want you
Love in the altitudes, no one but me and you<start>Blossom, commander and the leader

You see I wanna be good to you, baby but sometimes I just don't know how
And the hand of fate, reaches out once more
And pulls me though that gate, like one hundred times before
Ooh, there are the nights, when things just work out right
No one could be as close as you and me
Then it all breaks down and we can't find that common ground
That's not the way, the way it oughta be, baby, oh, oh
Why do we laugh, why do we cry? Why do we feel this pain inside?
Only heaven knows, only heaven knows
In this game of hit and miss, how long can we go on like this?
Only heaven knows, only heaven knows
But if we threw it all away, it's something we'd regret someday
Oh, heaven knows
Why do we do these foolish things?
Only heaven knows
My intentions are good, my actions are hard to explain
I get misunderstood sometimes, there's nobody but me to blame
I've gotta speak my mind and deal with the situation
Open the lines, the lines of communication
Ooh there are the nights, we really get it right
Makin' love, endlessly
And then there are the days, we go our separate ways
As though there's nothin' left of you and me, baby, oh no
Nothin' left of you and me
Why do we laugh, why do we cry? Why do we feel this pain inside?
Only heaven knows, only heaven knows
In this game of hit and miss, how long can we go on like this?

With all the strength of a hurricane
You could've come like a forest fire

Quiet and soft and slow
Falling from the sky in the night
To the earth below
You could've swept in like a tidal wave
Or an ocean to ravish our hearts
You could have come through like a roaring flood
To wipe away the things we've scarred

You were quiet, You were soft and slow
Falling from the sky in the night
To the earth below
Ooh no, Your voice wasn't in a bush burning
No, Your voice wasn't in a rushing wind

Clap their hands and stomp their feet and reinstill some dignity

Every night is like oh...
Every night is like a revival, painting strangers faces with smiles
Every night is like a revival, and we always do it with style
Well I guess, I've always known somehow our loved was blessed
To light those candles under asses, make them scream and reach for rafters
Clap their hands and stomp their feet and reinstill some dignity
We'll make our way right back to Queens without the aid of luxury

Take the call
Were you pushed
Or did you fall?
Fell apart
Feeling low
Happy ride
The merry-go
And I always hear them singing
And complaining about the world
But my chiming bells are ringing out
The word the word the word
Love rebounds
Heart goes snap
Is she ever
Coming back?
Let her down
Break her fall
Never ever
Felt so small
And I always hear them singing
And complaining about the world
And my chiming bells are ringing out
The word the word the word
Feeling good again
Always hoped I would
Never believed
That I ever could
Felling blue again
Never wanted to
Under the weather
And it's over you
Over you (the hole in the holy)
(and the crack in our hearts)
Over you (it's love and love only)
(that sets our world apart)
Over you (worlds apart)
(joined at the heart)
Jump right in
Take the call
Were you pushed
Or did you fall?
Fell apart
Feeling low
Happy ride
The merry-go
And I always hear them singing
And complaining about the world
And my chiming bells are ringing out
The word the word the word
(repeat) feeling good again...
Over you (the hole in the holy)
(and the crack in our hearts)
Over you (it's love and love only)
(the sets our worlds apart)
(repeat) feeling good again...
Over you (and a dream is a means)
(to an end of the things)
Over you (that will tempt you away)
(from the path to the true way in)
(repeat) feeling good again...
Over you
Over you<start>Oh when you come home late with hardest reason
When you kiss me like your hardest reason
Do I worry do I worry do I worry
And when the songs you sing are sad and lonely
When you sit at home forget to phone me
Do I worry do I worry do I worry
Where do you go when you're not with me
There's a look in your eyes I don't like to see
Why don't you hold me like you use to do
I got a whole lot of loving just for you
But when your loving lips don't taste the same
And when you call me someone else's name
Well do I worry do I worry yes I do
Where do you go when you're not with me....
Over you I worry over you<start>Deep inside the silence staring out upon the sea
The waves are washing over half forgotten memory
Deep within the moment laughter floats upon the breeze
Rising and falling dying down within me
And I swear I never knew, I never knew how it could be
And all this time all I had inside was what I couldn't see
I swear I never knew, I never knew how could be
All the waves are washing over all that hurts inside of me
Beyond this beautiful horizon lies a dream for you and I
This tranquil scene is still unbroken by the rumors in the sky
But there's a storm closing in voices crying on the wind
The serenade is growing colder breaks my soul that tries to sing
And there's so many many thoughts when I try to go to sleep
But with you I start to feel a sort of temporary peace
There's a drift in and out
Drift in and out
Drift<start>Yell help, too many cooks and a bird in the bush, yell help
Yell help, if your mirror busts and your cat gets cussed, yell help
'Cause down the road you find someone else who's looking
Down the road you find another sweet lady cooking
So I gotta yell help
Yell help, some shelter from the storm like the travel agent warned
Yell help, if you can help your superstitions they gonna keep you warm
'Cause down the road you find someone else who's looking
Down the road you seen another sweet lady cooking
So I gotta yell help
I wish tonight wasn't Wednesday night
I wish it wasn't the thirteenth of July, yell help
And you're looking at the guy whose eyes can't deny
That he wishes he were somewhere else tonight
Well I met this woman down in New Orleans
Lord she built just like a dream
Even wore stockings that had seams
And she was ugly
Now hell I don't mind women of her kind
I'll even pay sometimes for a woman that's ugly
She built like a steamroller
Just the kind to mow you over anytime
Hey the moment might arrive
On bourbon street
Well the ugliest woman you'll ever meet
But she's mine all mine and she's ugly
So I better yell help<start>It is not I who sleeps
It is you who sleeps... you sleep
Insane you sleep, I sleep in sanity<start>There's something about the way we fit
There's something about this psycho trip
There's something about the way we groove
Something's got me and I just can't seem to choose
I want you
I hate you

But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
So I contemplate
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
There's something about the way we slide
There's something about this psycho ride
There's something about the things we do

One, two, fuck you
Never say no
I'm ready to go
We're out of control
But I can't let you go, let you go
There's something about the way we fit
There's something about this psycho bitch
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
I could suffocate
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
I love to hate you

glaubst Du nicht,da knnte noch was sein
uns nicht bekanntes Leben

frchtest Du den Gedanken
oder war er nicht vorhanden

Siehst Du nicht ihre Zeichen
siehst Du nicht,wie sie sich gleichen
sind es Zeichen fremden Lebens
oder warten wir vergebens?

Came burning down mainstreet
I touched the epiphone that hung on my hip
It knew the sound of my heartbeat
But turning the corner in a twisted heap
They pulled some bodies
From an upturned ford
Some kid looked at me and said it's only life
Might as well use it while we're young
Might as well use it while we're young
I queued with some friends outside the abc one
To see the killer with no name
Yeah de niros so great, and you know last week
I saw the universe in flames
But it's always the same like citizen kane
Y'end up with nothing and you leave for home
Talking and kicking coke cans in the street
As fu manchu looks on
As fu manchu looks on
And I thought they must think I'm crazy
The things I'll see for fun
Then in my mind I saw the enemy
And I wasted him with my gun
I thought of my brother working heathrow
Flying engines in the night
Learning every part he'll be through in years
When I'm signed on for life
Lying here waiting for a hero to rise
But a lazy man lies back instead
No one hears the young man when he's alone
Planning to kill someone
Planning to kill someone
And I thought it must be me who's crazy
The things I'll do for fun
Choosing poison to get to paradise
Paradise west one
And I thought it must be me who's crazy
The things I'll do for fun
Choosing poison to get to paradise
Paradise west one<start>[Distorted words]

Daydreams make the sparks
Storing fireflies in the dark
Poking holes in the sky like stars
I shrink as the world grows
Stabbed and they come to collect your soul
Connecting outside
And let it go
The air is here it's in my lungs
[Not Understandable]
I light another soon we'll see
That I am you and you are me
Change the time its just on the clock
Reverse the time until it stops
Before the world explodes to dust
And we all don't give a fuck

And might even raise a whole family

I wish I was the t-shirt lying across your skin
I wish I was the button on your favorite pair of jeans
So close to you, theres nowhere Id rather be
Ive never wanted someone so bad
I dont understand
Baby hold out your hands
Cause Im pouring out my heart
Like a drunken rain
Im telling you all my secrets
Im giving it all away
Theres a need for you that I cant ignore
And I cant keep it to myself anymore
Im pouring out my heart
Baby dont, dont let it fall
I want to be the thoughts flashing in your head
All the things that you dream when youre lying alone in bed
I wanna be the words to your favorite song
Making you want to dance, want to scream, want to sing along
Ive never wanted someone so bad
Come on take a chance
Baby hold out your hands
Cause Im pouring out my heart
Like a drunken rain
Im telling you all my secrets
Im giving it all away
Theres a need for you that I cant ignore
And I cant keep it to myself anymore
Im pouring out my heart
Baby dont, dont let it fall
Right in front your face (dont let it fall X2)
Close enough for you to embrace (dont let it fall X2)
Precious time dont waste it (dont let it fall X2)
You and I we could be so amazing, so amazing

Im telling you all my secrets

Coming down the street
Kick your can, kick your can
Better get your butt down on the curb
And say hey to me
I'm by the liquor store
Giving you the eye
When you walk by
I'm on the subway line
I'm in the coffee shop
Eating toast and eggs
Chorus:
I never beg baby
I never get down on my knees
I'm gonna get you just the same
Girl you had me gone long gone
Lost in your eyes
Cost in my pride
Now I got you calling me speaking me seeking me sexing me
What happened to my freedom
You need me like the air
You drink me like the water
Sort of funny I'm your daddy
You ain't my daughter
First you said you needed sapce
Then please leave my place
Every other day or so
Just get from my face
A taste of wet I got and got
I'll bet that woman tried to play me
The girl had much game I can't get with that
She paid her price to play
But Imma freak one moves
With a sure aim
I'll get you just the same
Chorus
I'm gonna get you undressed
Your mind ain't gonna rest
I'm the best I'm the best
Forget about that man I'm your one
Son of none
Imma move you Imma bruise you
Gonna make you love me
Then Imma lose you

Left no trace,
Sickened by this,
Place,
No pills for the pain,
Torn,
From this place,
Broken with no,
Faith,
Nothing left to lose.

Pounding like my own heartbeat,
With this storm,
Tearing my face,
Take her back,
To our hiding place.
Time,
Walks on by,
Leaves memories behind,
So warm and clear,
They,
Take them away,
Turn them cold and grey,
Old and used.
Her voice on the wind,
Pounding like my own heartbeat,
With this storm,
Tearing my face,
Take her back,
To our hiding place.
"Save me", I hear her cry,
One moment, for her life,
Is this a reason, good enough to die?
To save her, I must try.
Now she's with me,

Where your dreams burn fast
But your nights go slower
Ever find that you're compromising
All your hopes and fears
Just to get to know her
So you take a walk down the goodbye highway
The hello goodbye way
It's a long long road
Ever take a stroll down the goodbye highway
The some other time way
Try to ease your load
She was never one for social graces
And hangin' out with the midnight faces
Wore me out
I guess the thoughts of the nights alone
Or the time waiting for the telephone
Removed the doubt
So we took a ride down the goodbye highway
The hello goodbye way
It's the longest road
Soon you're fighting over the yours or my way
The do or die way's
The only way you know
So you stand up for the things that you're losing
Out on but it's all so confusing
You hold on but it slips right through your hands
Guess it's so long with a change of direction
Goodbye gotta make my connection
Solo, as you head on out the door, forever more
So you take a walk down the goodbye highway
The hello goodbye way
It's a one way road
Ever find yourself down the goodbye highway
The some other time way
Nowhere left to go, nowhere left to go<start>[Mother:]
Talk to me

In the scheme of things
[Mother:]
Talk to me

I feel your touch but it can't move me
I hear your words but they confuse me
[Mother:]
Let me in
[Prodigy:]
It all comes to nothing
In the scheme of things
Patterns emerge in nature's dance
Numbers are born in the wheel of chance
Why do I see this?
What does it mean to me?
A grand design in all its majesty
Vibrating strings, quantum gravity
Why was I chosen?
What does it mean to me?
Tell me why!<start>Black Light Burns
Cover Your Heart And The Anvil Pants Ody

Stick a stone in your mouth
You can always pull out
If you like it too much
Make a whole new religion
A falling star that you cannot live without
And I'll feed your obsession
There'll be nothing but this thing that you'll never doubt
A hit is hard to resist
And I never miss
I can take you out
With just a flick of my wrist
Make a whole new religion
A falling star that you cannot live without
And I'll feed your obsessions
There is nothing but this thing that you'll never doubt
This thing you'll never doubt
And I'll feed your obsession
The falling star that you cannot live without
I will be your religion
This thing you'll never doubt

There is no sense of balance
In the howling wind that calls to me
I can feel it everywhere but it's invisible to me
Distractions and spirit find me floating in a magnetic sea
The nights are phosphorescent
And the days are beautiful and bright
Until whispering mist it comes falling down on me
Oh there's fire burning
Looking for the magic
In the night time all this
Brings the magic back to me
I'm looking for the magic in the places I remember it to be
It's in the night time alleys
Winding through my deepest memory
And just one simple thought brings the magic back to me
I'm looking for the magic in the places I remember it to be
And just one simple thought brings the magic back to me<start>Words on a postcard from far away
Spoke of a time long ago
Laughed ourselves daft on that Saturday
Singing here we go

listening to chicken jazz...
See that man over there...
He's got cold feet
He'd march to the drum
But the drummer's
Dead beat
He's fragile tonight
But he says he's clean
He's uncertain when he's speaking
But he knows what he means
Ah he's shivering now
But he don't look cold
He say
Turn up the weather
So I do as I'm told
Do you know about empty
Die a little inside
Cos he hasn't lived until he's died
You couldn't have lived until you've tried
He hasn't lived until he's died
The Little Death...
See that woman over there
She got cold feet
She'd march to the drum
But the drummer's
Dead beat
She reach for the sky
But the sky turn black
She hanging by her nails
but her knuckles just cracked
She said, "It's strange but nice to have no
future or past
If you can't stand the heat
you just turn up the gas"
I nod as if I know she can't say I haven't tried
Cos she hasn't lived until she's died
you couldn't have lived until you've tried
She hasn't lived until she's died
The Little Death...

I was a happy country boy 'til television came along
It showed them far away places and it sho' was a bitch
'Cause every time I'd quit my traveling, well, my feet would start to itch
So I borrowed my daddy's suitcase and picked up my guitar
I walked up the highway and I flagged down a car
I hitchhiked out to Kansas City just as far as I could
My life was all before me and that highway sure looked good
Gimme that highway, better go my way
Crank up the big wheels, let 'em roll on
I'm movin' like a fast train, gimme that passing lane
And I'm gone, I'm packin' my load a little further down the road
I moved on down to Dallas soon as I got the chance
I was playin' funky music for them city folks to dance
And I had money in my pocket, I had fun in my bed
But I've been here a year now and it's gettin' to my head
'Cause I've been rocked into ruin, I've been discoed to death
I've been funk rocked and punk rocked 'til I can't catch my breath
I've been ragged 'til I'm ragged, I've been new waved 'til I'm blind
But I've got a solution for my funky state of mind
Gimme that highway, better go my way
Crank up the big wheels, let 'em roll on
I've movin' like a fast train, gimme that passing lane
And I'll be gone, no more blues just as long as I can move
Gimme that highway, better go my way
Crank up the big wheels, let 'em roll on
I've movin' like a fast train, gimme that passing lane
And I'm gone, I'm packin' my load a little further down the road<start>Come on (come on let me show you where it's at)
Ah, come on (come on let me show you where it's at)
Whoa!, come on (come on let me show you where it's at)
I said the name of the place is I like it like that
Come on (come on let me show you where it's at)
Ah, come on (come on let me show you where it's at)
Whoa!, I want to show you (come on let me show you where it's at)
I said the name of the place is I like it like that
They got a little place a-down the track
The name of the place is I like it like that
You take Sally and I'll take Sue
And we're gonna rock away all of our blues
Come on (come on let me show you where it's at)
Oh, come on (come on let me show you where it's at)
Ah, come on (come on let me show you where it's at)
The name of the place is I like it like that
The last time I was down they lost my shoes
They had some cat shoutin' the blues
The people was yellin' and shoutin' for more
And all they kept sayin' was-a "go man, go"
Come on (come on let me show you where it's at)
Ah, come on (come on let me show you where it's at)
Oh, I want to show you (come on let me show you where it's at)
I said the name of the place is I like it like that
Come on (come on let me show you where it's at)
Ah, come on (come on let me show you where it's at)

Is gone away and no I never
I never stop the play don't lie to
The woman in your bed shake hands
With the killer in your head and all
The same I'm ready to fight you
Don't seem like people to me
Inside there's always a door that
Lets you out to escape away
Shake hands with the killer in your
Head don't lie to the devil in your
Bed miles and miles away when I
Ever look through that door I think
Of flight and I'm tempted by the wind
But when I look beyond her body
She's the dove I'm thinking of
Don't lie to the woman in your bed
Shake hands with the killer in your
Head shake hands with the killer
In your head shake hands with the
Killer<start>You let me follow you around
It helped your status in the town
Well I didn't know your name
There's no truth in what you claim
So I think you better stop this foolin' 'round
I think it's called a lesson learned
When one so close suddenly turns
Leaves you standing on your own
Got no place to call your home
So I think you better stop this foolin' 'round
Now it's my time to make amends
Hope my message don't offend
And I hope this doesn't drive you round the bend
Leaves you standing on your own
Got no place to call your home
So I think you better stop this foolin' 'round
Yes, I think you better stop this foolin' 'round<start>They hold the flame to you,
crushing you apart into.
A million shades of blue,
and you just let them.
Don't look now,
they're making their rounds again.
You have to run when they're gone.
Can you make it all the way home?
We'll own the world one day.
It's only gonna be a little bit longer.
We're gold in every way.
You were meant to hear the sound,
of everything falling into place for us.
Me and you are gonna be the last ones standing.
We'll own the world one day.
And it's time to stop complaining now.
You shine the light on me,
questioning the words I weave.
My eyes are tired and weak,
but I just sit there.
Can't look now,
but I can see the door behind our backs.
If I can stand up.
I can make it all the way home.
We'll own the world one day.
It's only gonna be a little bit longer.
We're gold in every way.
You were meant to hear the sound,
of everything falling into place for us.
Me and you are gonna be the last ones standing.
We'll own the world one day.
And it's time to stop complaining now.
You sing along with me,
I'm a human being.
Not for sale, I'm not for sale.
Nobody can purchase me.
Now sing along with me,

I'm not for sale, I'm not for sale.
Nobody can purchase me.

I said baby, don't you want a man like me?
I could give you so much lovin'
More than a woman ever seen
Now come on baby, now we can make some love tonight
I said baby, make some love tonight
Well be rollin' out the blankets

Your rollin' man, I've got all the love you need
Rollin' man baby, I've got all the love you need

Come on baby, make some love tonight
Well be rollin' out the blankets
I'm gonna make you feel alright<start>So tired sleeping through the day
Bloodshot eyes and sweat from my body
And I picked my head up yesterday
Found the reason of hope left inside of me
But I still believe in immortal love
And I know there's someone above
Shine down, don't take it away from me, no
And I know you know how, yeah
Shine down, just give me a chance to feel it
It's taken forever to get me off the ground
Dead silence overwhelming me
Deny takes it's toll on my sanity
And I know I've been away too long
All these years I've been hiding
I'm feeling I'm coming strong
But I still believe in immortal love
And I know there's someone that's up above
Show me a path to find my way
And give me a reason pray
Shine down, don't take it away from me, no
And I know you know how, yeah
Shine down, just give me a chance to feel it
It's taken forever to get me off the ground
Shine down, don't take it away from me, no
And I know you know how, yeah
And shine down, just give me a chance to feel it
It's taken forever to get me off the ground
Shine down
Shine down
Oh, shine down
Oh baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shine down
Oh, shine down
Oh, shine down
Oh baby shine down<start>I slit my wrists with my swing line
Copied myself five hundred times
I pierced my ears with a 3-hole punch
Ate twelve dozen donuts for lunch
But next week I'm a walk, next week I'm a walk:
And the week after that I'm gonna run.
I swam in an Olympic-size pool;
Had a picnic with a ventriloquist
Saw my brother coming up the hill:
He wrapped a beach towel round my wrist
So next week I'm a walk, next week I'm a walk:
And the week after that I'm gonna run.
I dumped Surel for an older man;
Now I'm doing it for Dante.
Gimme some of that nasty water,
I'll take it one sip at a time.
So next week I'm a walk, next week I'm a walk:
And the week after that I'm gonna run.
Next week I'm a walk:
And the week after that I'm gonna run
On one of those things:
It's something like a treadmill I think.
So next week I'm a walk, next week I'm a walk:
And the week after that I'm gonna run.<start>And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack
And you may find yourself in another part of the world
And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife
And you may ask yourself, well, how did I get here?
Well, how did I get here?
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground
And you may ask yourself
How do I work this?
And you may ask yourself
Where is that large automobile?
And you may tell yourself
This is not my beautiful house
And you may tell yourself
This is not my beautiful wife
Not my beautiful wife
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground
The same as it ever was
The same as it ever was
The same as it ever was
And you may ask yourself
What is that beautiful house?
And you may ask yourself
Where does that highway go to?
And you may ask yourself
Am I right? Or am I wrong?
And you may say to yourself
My god, what have I done?
What have I done?
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime<start>Beauty is what the eyes behold
And you burn brighter than most
I chased you through the midnight streets
To be where I could speak freely
I didn't care what tomorrow held
I felt the world turning only for us
Only bliss now for you and me
Rise up let life's kiss send us reeling
And unlike the times before
From yesterday comes tomorrow
When life comes alive the past moves aside
No regrets and no remorse
We have more than everything
More than man or machine
More than luck
More than fiction
Higher than any religion
And unlike the times before
From yesterday comes tomorrow
When life comes alive the past moves aside
No regrets and no remorse
We'll squeeze the blood out of life
And say goodnight to the silver of old
Even when wrong we're right
Far beyond the world of diamonds and gold
I've come to realize
Where happiness lies
I want you to know I know
And unlike the times before
When life comes alive the past moves aside
No regrets no remorse<start>Sittin' at a stop sign
Lookin' for a friend of mine
Waitin' to salute the flag
Talkin' to some he/she
Slidin' over next to me
Man, she said, this life is a drag
It's a shaky situation
And I'm hangin' on my will
And I get no satisfaction
From a hundred dollar bill
But I got what I came for
And I'll do it 'til I drop
You do what you want to do
I ain't never gonna stop
You say you got somethin' that makes you feel good
And you can't stop messin' with it
All your life you've been so misunderstood
Cause you can't stop messin' with it
Sittin' by the seashore
Dreamin' 'bout a little more
Circlin' the classifieds
Nine seven six
Man I need another fix
I'll never have to kiss the bride
Yeah, the city is a war zone
This country gone to hell
And the beer cans in the alley
From the rich folks on the hill
They're screamin' hallelujah
But I don't give a damn
Cause I got my own religion
Yeah, it's right here in my hand<start>I want to live,
I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.
It's these expressions I never give
That keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old.
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old.
I've been to Hollywood
I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old.
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old.
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
You keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old.
I've been a miner for a heart of gold<start>It's been a long long time since everything was cool
I shoulda seen it coming but I guess I'm not the only fool
There's something growin' on the outside
Too much missin' on the inside
Should I waste my time and let you lead me on and on
And on and on?
Waiting for the day when I'm complete
Without you I'm
Doing what I can to let you be
Making sure there's nothing showing on the outside
Something's dying on the inside
I'm still broken but I'm free
I'll see you on the flip side
I've got a bruised up heart
But I'm still hanging out
I should take it easy but I'm still gonna get around
There's something growing on the outside
Too much missing on the inside
Should I waste more time when everything is done
And done and overdone
Waiting for the day when I'm complete
Without you I'm
Doing what I can to let you be
Making sure there's
Nothing showing on the outside
Somethings dying on the inside
I'm still broken but I'm free
I'll see you on the flip side<start>I breeze through the day
And nothin' much seems to get in my way
I don't have a care at all
You walk in the room
It's always the same
You call out my name
I turn
You smile
I fall
I'm at home at night
Just me and the moon
But doin' all right
When out of the blue you call I hang up the phone
I lay down in bed
Your still in my head
I dream
You smile
I fall
Oh what could this feeling be
Could it really be love
That's happening to me
Oh yeah yeah
The closer you get
The harder it is to keep it together
I don't have a chance at all
It's out of my hands
Oh but what can I do
I'm crazy for you
We touch
You smile
I fall<start>Things I try don't work out. Other people
gripe and shout. That's not positive. I'm
not perfect. I'm just Civ.
Trial and error...Good Intentions!
Throw a beer at the stage, that's how you
behave. Paid admission, had no fun.
You think I'm the stupid one.
Think again...Good Intentions!
I'll just try my best...and you?
Nothing.<start>Youre so of a child suspended in space
Crying out to you
Beckons you to yet another fine place
Where the trials of life are few
Dont think youre living long
Who says you are coming on
They wont remember you
The rent is always due
The cloudy men who take their place
And stand in line they do
Know not of the satin face
That separates them from you
Just put your blue jeans on
Grab your guitar and sing a song
Dont think Im kidding you
The rent is always due
And she rides a broom with gold-plated straw
And she flutters around and she cries
The brylcream fools just standing on
Digesting all her lies
But then you walk along
And she starts coming on
Beneath her melting broom
The rent is always due<start>For judgment on my mind
For judgment on my mind
For judgment on my mind

The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
And the itsy bitsy spider climbed up the spout again

And who knows where or when
Bit it's comin' around again
[Chorus]
I know nothin' stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's comin' around again<start>Gave up trying, you've been seen lying around
Hoping someone would tell you where to go
You swing your partner, God's your partner now
And you just dipped him on the floor
If you see me going by
Then you've seen me going by
I thought life meant you were living
I thought death meant you were dying
Now I sit around and I stare
How dare call this a living room, my living room
Gave up caring, you've been seen staring out
Did you expect the, paneling to glow
You're looking for a savior, to take things over now
Seems you don't want to try
If you see me going by
Then you've seen me going by
I thought life meant you were living
I thought death meant you were dying
Now I sit around and I stare
How dare call this a living room
I thought time would always be there
I thought my life might go somewhere
Now I sit around it's a big despair
How dare call this a living room
If you see me going by
Then you've seen me going by
I thought life meant you were living
I thought death meant you were dying
Now I sit around and I stare
How dare call this a living room
I thought time would always be there
I thought my life might go somewhere
Now I sit around it's a big despair
How dare call this a living room

I thought death meant you were dying
Now I sit around and I stare
How dare call this a living room

How dare call this a living room

I should know I am one
I'm a drunken junkie bum
Then there's those Berkely bitches
Think they'll go from rags to riches
Hang out on University
but now they've got my herpes
You give them enough cash
They'll do anything you ask
They'll take it
They'll take it up the ass
Then there's those Berkely bad boys
Don't know how to use there dicks as toys
They only use them to pee
So I taught them something kinky
Now they're fetid virgin killers
Mother rapers and hooker thrillers
They'll bend you down to your knees
Steamy musous is set free
We're the people who raped your mom
She warned you against our mob
We chained her up to the toilet
That cunt did grind we blew her jets
We're all degenerate trash
Ridin the mud train up your ass
We'll be your friends and rip you off
Stick pig brains up grandmas's cunt<start>Left here long ago
Was passing through the years
I was waiting for the day
Chasing a distant star
While the sun just slipped away
Lost my way long ago
Was running in circles
I was drifting through the night
Tracing a fading star
Moving slowly out of sight
Lost my way, I lost my way back then
Now it seems I'm lost; it seems I'm lost again
[Chorus]
I left here long ago
Was someone else back then
I left here long ago
Now I'm leaving again
I lost my way long ago
Was somewhere else back then
I lost my way back then
And now I'm lost again
Everything changes
Everyone moves apart
Left here long ago
Now I'm staring into space
As my thoughts drift back to you
I'm facing a falling star
Moving swiftly out of view
Left here way... I left here way back then
Now I'm leaving; I'm leaving again
[Chorus x 2]<start>Behind the golden gates and the locked doors.
Away from where the cops beat aimlessly.
Where the parasites are plentiful and the usurpers feast on the work of others.
Ours will be done...
One more time.
We will meet again.
The only place where equality busts.
Where the kings and the queens finally share their homes and the starving cry no more.
As we all rot in peace.
As we all rot together.
Together in peace.<start>too much horror business drivin' late at night psycho '78 my bathroom is new you, you don't go in the bathroom with me psycho '78 12 o'clock, don't be late all this horror business my mirrors are black you don't go in the bathroom with me with you i'll put a knife right in you i'm warning you i'll put a knife right in you i'm warning you i'll put a knife right in you too much horror business drivin' late at night psycho '78 my bathroom is new for you you, you don't go in the bathroom with me psycho '78 i'm talkin' about 12 o'clock, don't be late i say, all this horror business my mirrors are black for you you, you don't go in the bathroom with me with you i'll put a knife right in you i'm warning you i'll put a knife right in you i'm warning you i'll put a knife right in you i'm warning you i'll put a knife right in you i'm warning you you, nobody can do what i can do, no<start>I've laid this island sun a 1000 times
I'm on it
But I'm going strange
This island's chills and shell cover me
With winded rock
And skies I've got yet to see
I tried
I even sent in friends
They did it as a favor
Cause I'm not that way
I am the autumn in the scarlet
I am the make-up on your eyes
I land to sail
Island sail
Yeah, we're movin
Yeah, we're movin
This island's sun I've laid 1000 times
Fortune me
Fortune me
Of all my mistakes
I think I lent you late
But I've never seen a scarlet
Or a riot or the violence of you
I land to sail
Island sail
Yeah, we're movin'<start>I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self pity
What to do, what to do, what to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known
A foggy day in London town
It had me low and it had me down
I viewed the morning with much alarm
The British museum had lost its charm
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?
But the age of miracles hadn't passed
For, suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere
A foggy day in London town
It had me low and it had me down
I viewed the morning with much alarm
The British museum had lost its charm
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?
But the age of miracles hadn't passed
For, suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining upside-down!<start>Instrumental<start>Pull on up
To the soapbox stool
Let me tell ya some stories
About how life can be cruel
I had big dreams
But they turned to dust
I need another shot of oil
'Cause it's starting to rust
And I'm tryin' to make a living
Tryin' to find my way
I've been bustin' my ass
To be somebody someday
Tryin' to make a living
Tryin' to get ahead
Shootin' at the moon
But it shot me down instead
[Chorus:]
War stories
I'm kickin' and fightin' for my life
Through those war stories
I made it through the battle of life
And it's on and on until you're long gone
But the strong keep stickin' it out
Through those war stories
Everybody's got 'em, when you hit the bottom and survive
I said have another drink
This one's on me
Let me tell ya 'bout pain from A to Z
I got scars from my head to my feet
Some like a junkyard car still rolling down the streets
And I'm tryin' to make a dollar
Tryin' to pay my way
I've been bustin' my balls
And then they take it all away
Tryin' to climb the ladder
Reaching for the sky
I ain't going down
Until they hang me out to dry
[Chorus]
And it's on and on, until you're long gone
But the strong keep stickin' it out
They got towing the line 'til the sun don't shine
But all I got left to talk about
Are those war stories.
I'm kickin' and fightin' for my life
Through those war stories
I made it through the battle of life
War stories
Through those war stories
Everybody's got 'em when you hit the bottom and survive<start>(Latimer)

Opened up my eyes
See the bombers riding
Dark against the sky
Fly like an eagle
Carried on the wind
See our hearts are broken
So many lives are gone
Waiting for this dream to end
We're not alone
We'll live on forever
They echo the songs
Of the partisans
Don't be afraid
We're heading for glory
The fears of the past
Bring tears of today
Nothing's going to change
Cold is the winter
Chills you to the bone
Praying for the silence
Will the morning come?
Out on the border
Lost without a friend
Searching for a reason
The battle rages on
Waiting for this dream to end
We're not alone
We'll live on forever

Of the partisans
Don't be afraid

Went and had my mind made up so suddenly
And it's bein' hungry when you can't take the fall away
Got you on the phone guiltin' me
Thinkin' how you looked at me so eagerly
But it was some of them kids in the city playin'
Ended up at home on empty with the windows down
Tryin' to say everything but knowin' you
I'd hate to see you lookin' so down
Wish you weren't so tied to me but you are
Sooner than it happens to all that you are
Right on my way home
Still in my mind won't you give us a call?
Summer's so fine I don't need you at all
Right you so said, "Yeah"
Ended up at home on empty with the windows down
Every time I look at you
I see you just like lookin' through the windows downtown
Ended up at home on empty with the windows down
Tryin' to say everything but knowin' you
I?d hate to see you lookin' so down
Got you on the wrong side of me
Went and had my mind made up so suddenly
And it?s bein' hungry when you can't take the fall away
And it saw this willin' to kill the rest of the day
I try to look at you that way it drives me, hey, oh, ah
Ended up at home on empty with the windows down

It's almost over now
It's what you fear
Will come true somehow
Try not to think
Because the pain will go away
Let's hope it's not too late
Cause you were always right
And I was always wrong
I never thought this night
Could ever last so long
You taught me how to breathe
And not to gasp for air
Pretend that you don't mind
But I know that you care
Goodbye
It's time for me to go
On with my life
And as I leave you with this song
So long
Getting in your car
You're not so brave
You're looking back
And I'm standing here
You're not alone
And I'm mouthing word to you
Please remember to write me soon<start>Look at this big - eyed fish swimming in the sea oh
How it dreams to be a bird swoop and diving through the breeze
So one day caught a big old wave up on to the beach
Now he's dead you see beneath the sea is where a fish should be
But oh God
Under the weight of life
Things seem brighter on the other side
You see this crazy man decided not to breathe
He turned red and blue - purple, colorful indeed
No matter how his friends begged and pleaded the man would not concede
And now he's dead you see the silly man should know you got to breathe
But oh God
Under the weight of life
Things seem brighter on the other side
Oh God
Under the weight of life
Things seem so much better on the other side
No way, no way
No way out of here
You see the little monkey sitting up in his monkey tree
One day decided to climb down and run off to the city
But look at him now lost tired living in the street
As good as dead you see what a monkey does - stay up your tree
But oh God
Under the weight of life
Things seem brighter on the other side
Oh God
Under the weight of life
Things seem so much better on the other side
No way, no way, no way
No way out of here
Rain in my dreams
Fall away<start>One more murder in this town,
Don't mean a thing just lock your doors
And drive around.
One more murder in this town,
Don't worry the rain will
Wash the chalk marks from the ground.
Saturday night, shots ring out,
Add one to the body count.
You come alive to see another's end.
Plead it to a lesser count,
D.A. says without a doubt,
In 3-5 you're on the streets again.
One more murder in this town
Don't mean a thing
You get accustomed to the sound
One more murder in this town
Block off the street and
Wrap the crime scene tape around.
Hosanna! Hosanna!
I can't feel a thing at all!
Hosanna! Hosanna!
I can't feel a thing!
I can't feel a thing at all!
Saturday night you're going out
Parking lot, a figure come about
Feel a piece click against your head.
Pleading to his sympathy,
"Take the car, I got a family"
You hear a laugh,
"It don't mean shit to me."
One more murder in this town<start>Well I'm drinking by myself
While everybody else
Sings songs down in the park
Brown paper bagging it after dark
But it's a plastic bag for me
Carrying my groceries
A few cans of champagne
Chose the high life for the rain
And the door man calls my name
Good old Joe sure knows my game
Though he says it's the youth to blame
I can't say I feel the same
See I'll be nursing number one
And too soon beer two is done
And then it's three, four, five, six
And they're all empty again
And still half the flask
I always forget I have
Sitting in in my office with my .38 special revolver
Still half the flask
I always forget I have
Sitting in in my office with my .38 special revolver (x3)
Looking back through another empty glass
To the past when I was so small
Peaking over the counter that was too tall
Stealing my first sip of alcohol
This could be my last slug of it all
There's still half the flask
I always forget I have
Sitting in my office with my .38 special revolver
Still half the flask
I always forget I have
Sitting in in my office with my .38 special revolver (x5)
If the dead haunt the places
Their bodies are found
Chamber me one last round to see
If my luck will keep
If my luck will keep
Oh yes chamber me
One last round to see
If my luck will keep this gun company
Drinking by myself
While everybody else
Is passed out in the park
Or going home in police cars
They sing
Oh la da da oh la la la (x12)<start>Heres a little something for ya babe
Just another game that we can play
I spy with my little eye a girl that wont turn away
So much that I just wanna say
Cant find a reason or a way
Last night it felt so right
It makes me wanna stay
Chorus:
Hey girl, you got the moves girl
Doing what you do
Youre making my eyes move all over you
Hey, I know what you like
You tease when you bite
And were gonna test our bodies tonight
Heres another question for you babe
What can I do to make you wanna stay
Cause my eyes are locked in tight
And I cant turn away
Slide across the room and you will see
Im closing in and I can feel the heat
Im sure your looks are pure but a muse is what I see
I love the way your hips move when youre out there on the floor
I love the way your body screams, say I want more
Chorus
I got a feeling its only us tonight
Just the beginning
Burning the city, well take it all tonight
Chorus<start>Been left for dead
I know it's in the back of your head
Been left for dead
Sister you're better than that
Been sold downstream
Sold down river to the cousin of the king
Been left for dead
Sister you're better than that
A e i o u
A e i o u
A e i o u
Gonna beat him instead
Beat all the odds that you got up ahead
You gonna beat him instead
Cause sister you better than that<start>When I've gone too far
When I've had enough
When I've losin' ground
Feelin' out of touch
I don't run and hide
I just look inside
For a simple peace of mind
Like a neighborhood
On a city street
I know the path
It knows my feet
And when I feel afraid
Feel like checkin' out
You stand up and take a bow
You shine when others need you
You speak and I believe you
I know the light, it guides you
I'll join the line that walks behind you
You shine, you shine
Like a window to your heart I see
All the possibilities
You shine, you shine
And everyday is another opportunity
To shine
The way you see the world
The way it sees you back
You're the photographer
You take the photograph
If you don't like the way
The way it looks at you
You've got all the power to choose
Turn right, turn left, turn the other way
Make it light, make it dark, make it
Go away
I love to way you write the script to your own life
You're the star, you're on tonight
And when I feel unnoticed
Just two steps away from hopeless
You turn my world around with a single smile
That's who you are, that's who you are
You shine, you shine
Like a window to your heart I see all the possibilities
You shine, you shine
And everyday us another opportunity
To shine
To shine
I know the light, the light that guides
I'll join the line that walk behind you
You shine, you shine
In my life I know you shine
You shine
Like a window to your heart I see all the possibilities
You shine
And everyday is another opportunity
To shine<start>Hey baby, what you gonna do
When the lights go up on you?
What's your name, can I drive you home?
Sweet woman, are you all alone?
You're the one for me
I'm gonna keep you busy as a bee, could bee, could be
Rat bat blue
Now, get up woman, don't be slow
It's getting late and I wanna go
No cause for acting big
Got to love, got to live
Stick around with me
I'm gonna show you things you never thought you'd see,
You see
Rat bat blue
You're so fine
Get out!
You didn't understand
I'm a hard loving man
No way you can satisfy
The way you look, the way you lie
And when you shut the door
Make sure I don't see you 'round here no more
Rat bat blue
Alright<start>Can't see the wood for all of the trees
Can't hear the wind for the breeze that whispers
Voice in your head, you like what it said
So what can you do but listen to it?
What kind of fool
Lays all that's precious to waste?
What kind of fool
Leaves all their treasure to rust in the rain?
They'll need it again when the sky clears
What kind of fool
Won't discover the jewel
'Til the dust clears ?
Fools like us
Fools who want more than they've treasured before
Wanting the dawn of the brightest morning
Reach for the stars 'cause they're sweeter by far
Than the moon 'though she's brighter
And closer to you<start>talk in circles
spewing lies, disinformation
but we see right fucking through
who could believe in your false agendas anyway
i refuse to sit by watch you destroy us, destroy everything i love
empty words won't hold you up this time
feels like seconds away, from a fate beyond control
like seconds away, falling fast out of control
after the dust fades,
following the end game what we'll have left is sand
through our hands
this constant devotion to capitalist notions will be our demise
listen to me i've had enough, i can't take it anymore
try and find some piece of mind anywhere,
why can't we strike at the source
feels like seconds away, from a fate beyond control
like seconds away, falling fast out of control
after the dust fades,
following the end game what we'll have left is sand
through our hands
this constant devotion to capitalist notions will be our demise
our demise<start>Trinidad tiene triple personalidad

Today I Got Your Letter
The One You Said I Never Would Read
And It Seems You've Been Through Some Weather
And You Feel Like Surrendering
Before You Commit The Crime
Before You Abandon Your Dreams
Take A Look, How The Hardest Of Times
Will Drive You To Your Knees
The Very Place You Needed To Be
Chorus
Were You Can Hold,
Hold On And Let The Wind Blow
Hold, Hold On
Verse Two
Well I Know It Sounds Too Simple
But I Beg You, Don't Be Confused
Many Times It's In The Simple
That We Find The Home Of The Truth
That We Find The Home Of The Truth
And The Truth Would Say To
Chorus
Hold,
Hold On And Let The Wind Blow
Hold, Hold On
When The World Says Let Go
Hold, Hold On
When You Feel Like Letting Go
Hold On

And When Your Hand Starts To Slip
And When You're Losing Your Grip
And When You Know Your Hope Is Gone
You're Not The Only One Holding On

I Was Moved By Your Honesty
And I Know You've Been Through Some Weather
Let It Drive You To Your Knees
The Very Place We Need To Be.<start>Protect me in your arms

I need you and your love true.

* Prisoner of the night
Saw a black cat in a blind alley way
The way bad luck runs it could be here any day
Landlord raises rent - just about all my
Money spent - the lady's on her way comin'
But I know she can't
Ten empty bottles on the floor
Matching ten notches on someones door
Somebody better turn me in
I'm going crazy again
It's outa my hands
Got nothin' to lose nothin' to win
I'm goin' insane - the whole thing is
Caving in going crazy again
It's gotta be bad timing and the way
I'm livin'
Everybody's tryin' to act surprised
'bout the way I get myself revived
Couple a stitches and a light head
Coming around the bend - ninety buck
Treatment gettin' myself analyzed
Who's that snake in the corner
Talkin' 'bout disorder - I'm gonna crush
It before it gets me alive
Somebody better turn me in
I'm going crazy again<start>Lipstick and lashes, the traces of stardom
Lit up on a billboard so everyone sees them in neon
Behind a counter she stares out the window
Up at the billboard that's like a reminder in neon
She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror
Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon
For two cents of danger she'd trust anybody
She'd smoke like a gun if it meants she might wind up -
[Chorus]
In neon the dreams in the light of a promise that dies
A shimmering city, a glimmer of hope and a lie
In neon the name's gone there's no reason why anymore
Trust them and wind up alone behind a locked door
In neon, in neon...
Pictures and patterns, the touches of glamour
Cut into fashion that flashs above 'em in neon
A hot cup of coffee held in her fingers
A perfect complexion that lingers above her in neon
She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror
Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon
For a shot at the title, she'd slip into something
She'd smoulder like ashes if it meant she might wind up -
In neon...
[Chorus]<start>No, don't mock me
Don't you look at me, pity me, feel for me
It's okay
look down on me
cause now you're born again, dead again so
now to my face you lie to me
Don't sit there and tell me
you just want to be my friend
don't lie to me
don't sit there and judge me..you don't wanna face yourself
don't lie to me
don't sit there and test me I don't have the patience now
don't lie to me
don't lie to me
All the times I've seen your face
never thought I could erase
and now I watch it slip away
you can never take my place
I don't want this..I don't need this
I will never go away
I leave this all to you to live inside you till you die
No don't mock me
don't you point at me, laugh at me, turn on me
It's okay
look down on me
I will always be what you see so
now to my face you lie to me
don't sit there and tell me
you just want to be my friend
don't lie to me
don't sit there and judge me..you don't wanna face yourself
don't lie to me
don't sit there and test me
I don't have the patience now
don't lie to me
don't lie to me
All the times I've seen your face
never thought I could erase
and now I watch it slip away
you can never take my place
I don't want this..I don't need this
I will never go away
I leave this all to you to live inside you till you die
All the times I need you
you are never there
All the times I need you
you are never there
All the times I need you
you are never there
All the times I need you
you are never there
All the times I need you
you are never there
All the times I need you
you are never there
All the times I've seen your face
never thought I could erase
now I watch it slip away
you can never take my place
I don't want this..I don't need this
I will never go away
I leave this all to you
cause you can never take me..me..me
you'll never take me..me..me
you'll never take me<start>I saw a smile on her face reminds me of the sun filled days that we'd waste away
Dreamin' of a world of love in harmony
Well my dream's comin' true and I
wish you were here so you could see all the smilin' faces I'm smilin' at you
Look how far we've come since the spring roses fallin' to the ground it don't
mean a thing 'cause true love flies free as a dove
I keep hopin' that the end will never come...
I'll keep on waitin' right here for you
did we get further away or a little bit
closer still wastin' away but my dream's
not over there are so many steps left to
trace to see the smile on her face...
Such a pretty smile pretty smile pretty smile
Why don't you come just a little bit
closer you just seem so far away I try so
hard to keep on movin' on but I'm
getting caught up thinking about the time
we shared just wastin' away it seemed like they'd never end...
Keep on movin' on keep on dreamin'
It'll come right back to you right back to you
I saw a smile on her face reminds me
of the sun filled days that we'd waste
away dreamin' of a world of love in harmony...
My dreams come true I wish you
were here so I could see the forty
shades of green gleamin' in your eyes
Now the summer is gone and it won't
be long before I'm right back in the
middle torn between what I'm missin'
now and a sweet memory of yesterday...
A sweet memory of a sweet little
child I'd do anything for you
My sweet valentine<start>I'm finished with my woman
'Cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane
Because I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things
But nothing seems to satisfy
I think I will lose my mind
If I don't find something to qualify
Can you help me
Help me with my brain
And so as you hear these words
Telling you of my fate
I tell you to enjoy life
I wish I could but it's too late
Make a joke I will sigh
And you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel
And love to me is so unreal
I must be paranoid<start>Nos toca vivir tiempos
en los que ya nacemos muy viejos,
nos queda el cruel consuelo
de no mirarnos nunca al espejo
Nos cuesta levantarnos
y en la misma cuesta caemos
porque nos cuesta tanto
mejor quedarse siempre en el suelo
Se nos cambia la mirada
cada vez que se nos rompe el alma
se nos quitan todas las ganas
siempre esperamos que llegue el maÃ±ana.
Me quedarÃ© con muchas ganas de verte
vacÃ­o y sin aliento estarÃ©
a punto de encontrarte
cuando se acabe el tiempo volverÃ©
cuando no quede nadie
a ver si estÃ¡n los restos del que fui
pero ese nunca vuelve.
En mentiras creemos
nos limitamos a pensar que somos buenos
nunca nos preguntamos
solo hablamos, reÃ­mos y a veces lloramos
Cuando nos conocemos
empezamos a pensar lo que esta pasando
y miramos mas lejos
y miramos donde nunca habÃ­amos mirado.
Se nos hace corto el tiempo
cada vez que el corazÃ³n se embala
se nos pasa la vida entera
buscando aquella eterna mirada.
Me quedarÃ© con muchas ganas de verte
vacÃ­o y sin aliento estarÃ©
a punto de encontrarte
cuando se acabe el tiempo volverÃ©
cuando no quede nadie
a ver si estÃ¡n los restos del que fui
pero ese nunca vuelve.
Se nos cambia la mirada

In the water of my dreams
Alligator screams
From the depths there
I'd swim with you there
I'd swim with you there, yeah yeah
In the house I once used
There's a psycho on the loose
He's playing with the fuse of a bomb there
I could live with you there
I could live with you there
Bye bye long day
I need to sleep so much
You shined on me
Too much is not enough
On the sheets, pillow case
In my bed for heaven's sake
Devil's dancing until late
In my head there
But I could sleep with you there
I could sleep with you there
Always, always
Bye bye long day
I need to sleep so much
Nineteen hours straight
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough

I'll drive 'til the highway ends
Chasing after picture perfect sunsets
To take away my breath
I'm tired of living in the city
The world's got me tied on a string
Wanderlust has overcome me
Like Lewis and Clark I'll dream
There's a million different ways to go
Only God can know where I will call my home
Love lead me on
Where no one else has gone
Faith keep me strong
Love lead me on
The open road can be so lonely
I'm longing for someone to love
If only I could share my new surroundings
Open the doors above
There's a million different ways to go
Only God can know where I will call my home
Love lead me on
Where no one else has gone
Faith keep me strong
Love lead me on
There's a million different ways to go
Only God can know where I will call my home
Love lead me on

They're ready to fight for their rights
On May 3rd, 1886
Chicago burned with the fire they lit
The workers were on strike cause money's tight
The pigs were out and looking for a fight
They opened fire into the crowd
A worker was hit and he went down
No one's gonna hold them down
No! They're gonna burn this fuckin' town
August spies denounced capitalism
But he urged no violence
He was addressing a crowd of workers
The pigs ordered him silenced
A bomb was thrown and the silence wailed
A pig laid dead and 8 were jailed
That day the system failed
You know it never fails
If you think you can crush these ideas
That are gaining ground more each day
If death is the penalty for proclaiming truth
Then I'll proudly and defiantly pay
Four men were sentenced to death
To set an example to all the rest
Who would dare to stand and protest
The injustices we all detest<start>Oh, hey baby, there's something wrong
You burnt away, you wear the sun
And maybe, I slept too long
And missed the game, and now you're gone
You wear the sun
If I could, I would leave you alone
Baby, put down your gun
And turn away, you wear the sun
Maybe I should have told you I'm no fun
Before PM, and now you're gone
You wear the sun
If I could, I would leave you alone
There's a daisy chain
It's tying me down to the field of play
Such an open face
You're leaving me nothing but hope to chase
You got the sun
You wear the sun
You wear the sun
You wear the sun<start>The walls of my mind are closin' in.
Can't get away.
Your mem'ry won't end.

Can't forget about you. Can't forget about you.
Can't forget about you. Can't forget about you.
Breakin' my mind in three quarter time makin' me blue.
Can't forget about you. Can't forget about you.
I never stop hearin' the music after the song is through.
I still see your eyes, your warm, gentle smile.
It was all worthwhile, each moment we knew.
[Chorus]<start>Hi! How are you doin' Ladies?
Gracious! I am Speedy Joe.
I have many presents for you.
It's my soul, my blood, my ~~~.
Could you take off your bra in exchange for all?
Get back my youth, 'cause I have no time.
Get in line.
*Get - forget (8 times)
I'll welcome sexy teenager.
Well, I am...I am thirty-six.
Where is a beautiful busty bomb?
I only want all the girls I know.
Dull pretty blue eyes, a sweet sugar voice,
It's just like a dream!
I love you all!
Are you ready ? I'm coming soon.
I have no control.

Everything gonna be Al right. Let's sing, sing a song!

Laughed until we realize our hearts were struck were fear

Won't you let me treat you kind
We're gonna burn to shine
Funny things you learn from your mama, like the way to throw your head back
When your swallowing pills
Funny things you learn from your papa, like when you're talking you just can't
Keep your hands still
But that was now and this is then
It never lasts for long
How I miss the good old days; but I'm so glad they're gone
Won't you let me treat you kind
We're gonna burn to shine
Won't you let me treat you kind
We're gonna burn to shine
I'd like to spend the time that you would like to spend with me
So that you could help me out with my dependency
Cause I'm hopelessly addicted, addicted to your sorrow
Makes me never wanna work, beg or borrow
Won't you let me treat you kind
We're gonna burn to shine
Won't you let me treat you kind
We're gonna burn to shine<start>If somebody loves you it's not good unless he loves you all the way
Happy to be near you when you need someone to cheer you all the way
Taller than the tallest tree is that's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is that's how deep it goes yes it's real
If somebody needs you it's not good unless he needs you all the way
Through the good or lean years and for all the dream years come what may
Who knows where the road may lead us only a fool would say
But if you let me love you It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way all the way
Who knows who knows where the road<start>I can't deny it all my life
It's the token of my life

To pass away the while
It doesnt matter if you're
Red, black, or in the sack
I've got my grip, I've got a hold
Nothing ties one down like prime time in hi-fi
But now it's getting old
People stop and stare
Here, there, and everywhere
They've got the blueprints for life
They keep pretending
The world is ending
You'll be fictionized
So stop the human drive
The fierce power switching on the
Ripe adolescent light
Terminates in five
The people standing in the lines
Have seen the film a million times
With a pocket full of dimes
So unless it is for free
You'll spin the country on it's side
To be intensified
People stop and stare
Here, there, and everywhere
They've got the blueprints for life
They keep pretending
The world is ending
You'll be fictionized

It's on that tv
It's on your tv
It's on my tv
It's on his tv
It's on her tv

That the world is ending...
You'll be fictionized<start>What to say
There is nothing I can do
I cannot manipulate the way I used to
See them everywhere
The decoys they sent up
Now they're all shot down as if it wasn't bad enough
I put it down 'cause it makes no sense
I put it down to experience
I'd leave it all but no matter where I wake up hard
I wake pale
For an hour I'll be anyone
For a week I swear I can be no one
The fact is lying stilland the favors are all spent

I cannot communicate

And once it starts
it was harder to tell them apart, oh ho ho
He was always distracted
by the very mention
of an open door, oh ho ho
cuz he had sworn
not to be what he'd been before

new wave,
come over here You're the prettiest thing I've seen all year Hey you,
new wave,
don't turn away Close those pouty lips and listen to what I say Why must you smoke that clove cigarette?
Why must you act like you've got a hole in you head?
Why don't you split the squares and love me instead?
You're all shiny and clean,
I've seen you in my dreams Like the Rolls Royce I can't have Your presence makes me scream Sour grapes,
you leave such a bad taste Sour grapes,
I don't need you anyways Sour grapes,
feeding,
feeding my rage Hey you,
new wave,
I pity you When you get old,
what will you do?
What will you do when you turn 21?
You're cockteasing at the singles bar just for fun What will you do when you turn 31?
What will you do when you don't know how to love anyone?
I wanted her cherry,
I got sour grapes I refuse to climb the ladder for you I refuse to pant and paw for you I need love,
don't need no beauty queen But still,
when I look at you,
I scream Sour grapes,
you leave such a bad taste Sour grapes,
I don't need you anyways Sour grapes Just go riding right by me on the crest of the new wave Sour grapes,
feeding,
feeding my rage.<start>You, me
Understand
Shake my hand
Last chance, little man
Ain't it grand
It's a bargain, it's a steal
30 pieces of silver
And a deal's a deal
Sign upon the dotted line
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Nothing's free
Eventually
Nothing's free
From the rules and laws of morality
Free to take your fill
Free from your own free will
Nothing's free
My boy, it's getting late
I'll raise the stakes
So close
Control your fate, why hesitate
Seal the deal, close the sale
Take my hammer, drive the nail
Sign upon the bloody line
A drop of yours, a drop of mine
Nothing's free
Eternally
Nothing's free
From your conscience or
Free from the consequence
Free to sin and death
Free till your final breath
Nothing's free
Free from the claws and flaws of your family
Free from obedient life
You're cut like a double-edged knife
Nothing's free, nothing's free
Oh, you pay me
Free to ignore the bore of authority
Free to spit in the face
Be the winningest rat in the race till Judgement Day
Then nothing's free
Bow to me if you want to be free
Free from life, come die with me
And when we're dead it's for eternity
Come on little one and dance in the fire
The heat's getting close
and the flame's getting higher
When the music's over there's a hush in the choir
Nothing's free
When the trumpets sound
and his light is all around
And the saints all raise from the graves
in the ground
We'll be going way downtown
Way downtown<start>sometimes it seems
like the void is larger than life
and i've none to give,
nothing to say
at the ending of the day
as i turn to go
man made prints in the snow
lines entwine
and in time it will show
dusk day fades in grey
i won't let me slip away<start>And Aubrey was her name,
A not so very ordinary girl or name.
But who's to blame?
For a love that wouldn't bloom
For the hearts that never played in tune.
Like a lovely melody that everyone can sing,
Take away the words that rhyme it doesn't mean a thing.
And Aubrey was her name.
We tripped the light and danced together to the moon,
But where was June.
No it never came around.
If it did it never made a sound,
Maybe I was absent or was listening to fast,
Catching all the words, but then the meaning going past,
But God I miss the girl,
And I'd go a thousand times around the world just to be
Closer to her than to me.
And Aubrey was her name,
I never knew her, but I loved her just the same,
I loved her name.
Wish that I had found the way
And the reasons that would make her stay.
I have learned to lead a life apart from all the rest.
If I can't have the one I want, I'll do without the best.<start>(David Lee Murphy)
I remember the night my dad stopped the car
And got out in the rain
Changed a blown out tire on a car
For a family with out of state plates
I said dad did we know those folks
As they waved and drove out of sight
He just smiled as he started the car
He said son not 'til tonight
You see the road you leave behind you
Is another road you're gonna have to come back down
It's just the way this big old world turns 'round
You'll find somehow somewhere someplace sometime
You gotta go back down the road you leave behind
Stuck out on the highway one night
Many years gone by
Had the hood of my truck pulled up
My ol' gas tank was dry
Some ol' guy gettin' off on the night shift
Pulled up to check on me
He said I been in your shoes before son
And it's no place to be
You see the road you leave behind you
Is another road you're gonna have to come back down
It's just the way this big old world turns 'round
You'll find somehow somewhere someplace sometime
You gotta go back down the road you leave behind
I said what do I owe you friend you could easily passed me by
He said next time it might be me son you don't me a dime
You see the road you leave behind you
Is another road you're gonna have to come back down
It's just the way this big old world turns 'round
You'll find somehow somewhere someplace sometime
You gotta go back down the road you leave behind<start>Well, I'm a king bee

Just what you mean
To me
And now
Now that you're near

That I've waited to share

Of our moments together
Color my world with hope of loving you<start>What if there was no lie
Nothing wrong, nothing right
What if there was no time
And no reason, or rhyme
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in your life
What if I got it wrong
And no poem or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in you life
Oooooooh that's right
Let's take a breath try to put it aside
Ooooooh that's right
How can you know it if you don't even try
Ooooooh that's right
Every step that you take
Could be your biggest mistake
It could bend or it could break
That's the risk that you take
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there in your life
That you don't want me there by your side
Oooooooh that's right
Let's take a breath try to put it aside
Ooooooh that's right
How can you know when you don't even try
Ooooooh that's right<start>Friends come and friends go
As I go round and round in circles
Love someone change your mind
Decide he was a swine
As you go round and round in circles
He who knows does not speak
He who speaks does not know
And I go round in circles
Dislike someone and will not bend
Later they may become your best friend
As life it goes around in circles
He who knows does not speak
He who speaks does not know
And I go round in circles
Soul takes on a body with each birth we make our date
With life and death along the road the soul reincarnates
The show goes round and round in circles
When loss and gain and up and down
Becomes the same, then we stop going in circles
Round and round in circles<start>There's a time in everybody's life
When nothing's going right for you
Take a chance
Take a step out on the ledge
Take a good look down
And realize it's all for you
For the night
I'm putting up a fight
I've opened up my eyes
To see a world a I never knew
It's time, time to put the past away
Time to take all of your life's reel
And learn to live again
So alive as you open up your mind
As you break away from everything
All that's stopping you
For the night
I'm putting up a fight
I've opened up my eyes
To see a world a I never knew
Time to fly
Time to kiss your fears goodbye
Tim to take control and realize
This world was made for you
There's a time in everybody's life
When nothing's going right for you
Take a chance
Take a step out on the ledge
Take a good look down
And realize it's all for you

Evening calling
On knees, a calling friends
Can't you see
Doesn't help to be

Strolling through lost times with you

Could it be they jumped the queue

Baby, we should've known
Where we were going
Should've known

We're in the sea of destiny
In the winter of our love
Do you know we're alone out here
What am I thinkin' of
Did this come to the time of year
Called the winter of our love

Oh, I needed you so
Ah, you know, I never, never want to let you go<start>Everybody's talking about the girl who went and killed the delivery man,
But she looks so kind and gentle, it just doesn't stand to reason,
I saw her right there just the other night as stately as a slot machine,
But when she looked my way something mad as hell came over me,
Anesthesia, Mona Lisa, I've got a little gun, here comes oblivion,
I never loved you, how did you find me?
The cops will never prove complicity now,
Anna,
All good children go to heaven!
I remember your face that august night
when we lied about the beautiful time to come
And that crazy old man who came much too late and caused a chain reaction,
I've been hanging out here for eleven long years like a church mouse
wondering where the cat as gone
And looking at you now is driving me to distraction,
Anesthesia, Mona Lisa, I've got a little gun, here comes oblivion,
I never loved you, how did you find me?
The cops will never prove complicity now,
Anna,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
All good children go to heaven!<start>Yeah, see the milk is in the fridge
And it's turning into cheese
If I'm so smart, how come I ain't rich?
No one knows and no one sees
My moral compass went out of course and I ran aground
You better watch how you get
But what the hell, what the heck?
I mean, I wrote out the check

No, it's the money you spend

The cold hand of currency
Grips my heart at night
Right now it's raining unpaid bills
From an unknown height

There was once when I had money
I act like I got it, pretend I know
It's minus 500 double 000

resistes en la vida sin pensar a donde vas
pensando estas palabras en la noche de un bar
encontr a un amigo, me puse a practicar:
y que piensas hermano de la noche irreal
es la vida una mulata que te atrapa sin cesar
pues habla pronto, dime, qu ves?
no se si miro al mundo del derecho o del revs
No supo contestar mi cancin
palmaditas en el corazn
y te vas a pasear por ah
que yo me voy a dormir
Si doy pena a la tristeza por la vida que llevo
aunque a veces ra mucho como un loco cuando bebo
si creen que porque canto soy feliz as sin mas
se equivocan le deca a mi amigo en aquel bar
Cuando yo hablaba todo mi garganta se sec
no tuve mas remedio que apretarme otro ron
esa noche me ayuda a comerme mas el tarro
mi amigo de 7 aos importado de La Habana
Como deca mi primo la noche es un animal
si la miras frente a frente puede llegar a asustar
pero que bien lo pasamos las noches por ah
estamos en la selva de la noche irracional
Esto hablaba con mi amigo que miraba con pereza
las chicas de los bares bebiendo una cerveza
yo increpaba, blasfemaba, criticaba con pasin

He came from the streets, she came from the mountains
A faded star and an angel without wings,
Their passions flowed like a deep running river
They had nothing left to lose and everything to gain and he said
Let's make a garden said the thorn to the wild rose,
plant some seeds deep in the ground,
Let's make a garden said the thorn to the wild rose,
strong enough to hold us down
Seasons will change, we'll last forever we'll see the snow and the
falling of the leaves
High on the hill with the sky all around us, we'll watch it grow
from two wild seeds
Let's make a garden said the thorn to the wild rose,
plant some seeds deep in the ground,
Let's make a garden said the thorn to the wild rose,

I said, "Sir, is she coming back soon?"
He smiled and he stated,
"Son, I'm over-rated,
I've had to much credit in those old love tunes.
I don't know a thing about love,
I just kind of hang here above.
I just watch from the sky,
Will love grow or will it die?
I don't know a thing about love."
Then I asked him "Where is she tonight?
You must see all things with your light."
He said, "Son, I could tell you things that might kill you,
But I don't get involved in what's wrong or right.
I don't know a thing about love,
I just kind of hang here above.
I just watch from the sky,
Will love grow or will it die?
I don't know a thing about love."
He said, "I can move oceans when I take the notion.
Or make mountains tremble and rivers run dry.
But in all matters human, remember there's someone
In charge of those things way above you and I.
I don't know a thing about love,
I just kind of hang here above.
I just watch from the sky,
Will love grow or will it die?
I don't know a thing about love.

There's a grinding in my brain.
The best part is that it turns you on.
The grinding penetrates
Under the sheets, my dear.
We lie in love, but with fool's gold.
I want to give you the plans
Just to make you stop.
I want you to get out of here for good.
It's in my bed, but my bed is a plot.
And the shovel is anchored down to the floor.
And I won't need to see you pushing up dirt again.
And I won't need to see you gagging on sincerity.
Daylight kills us.
KO'd by it and counting to ten.
Faced with choices
To pack it in or stand up and fight again.
There's something in my hand
Pushing into my veins.
The tablature is for a death march.
I can't miss you
Because you're already gone.
This is the climax to our love song.
You're in my head, but gone for good.
Your sonnet's melody plays on.
And I won't need to see you pushing up dirt again.
And I won't need to see you gagging on sincerity.
Daylight kills us.
KO'd by it and counting to ten.
Faced with choices
To pack it in or stand up and fight again.<start>Ein ganzes Land kniet nieder

I used to play till evening shadows come
And then winding down that old familiar pathway
I heard my mother call at set of sun
"Come home, come home, it's suppertime
The shadow's lengthen fast
Come home, come home, it's suppertime
We're going home at last"
Some of the fondest memories of my childhood
Are woven around suppertime
When Mama used to call out from the back steps
To the old home place, "Come on home, son, it's suppertime"
Oh, how I'd love to hear those words once more
But you know for me, time is woven in the realization of the truth
That's even more thrilling
And that's when the call comes from the portals of glory
To come on home, it's suppertime
"Come home, come home, it's suppertime
The shadow's lengthen fast
Come home, come home, it's suppertime
We're going home at last, we're going home at last"
When all God's children shall gather 'round the table
With the Lord Himself at the greatest suppertime of them all<start>The road turned into a snake

predisposed to forget the best part

made sure that the needle was clean when i let myself fall asleep

remind you not to forget to remember me

my home is your home

to portray the way you used to laugh
do you recall the day you wed

i'm just here to remind you
remind you not to forget to remember me

i don't possess the strength to answer straight
and no, i'm not afraid, at least not to die
i'm afraid to live and not remember why
sweet chemical indifference
i can't stop, can't change the evident
predisposed to perpetual sickness
i refuse to let you all be witness
make sure the needle is clean when you let me go back to sleep

That old mule laid down and died
Man I sent this woman
A brand new twenty dollar bill
Lord I sent that woman
A brand new twenty dollar bill
Now if that don't bring her back
I'm sure this old shotgun will

If I feel like this tomorrow
I'm gonna clear out be back down Memphis bound
I'll be standing down on the landing
When the big boat pull off and roll
I'll be standing on the landing
When the big boat pull off and roll
I'll be hopin and I'll be prayin

A broken boxer stuffed with glass and sand
This is now how health should feel
Songs sung from the lungs of the elderly
I'm dead now, check my chest and you'll see
The light has been mined from me, burned for the heat
Oh I'm dead now can you hear the relief
As life's belligerent symphonies finally cease
I put my heart where my mouth is
Now I can't thumb it down again
I've gone devilled my kidneys
Now he's living inside of me
So if we can't bring an exorcist
I'll settle for one of your stiffest drinks
And we'll scream hell towards heaven's door
And I will piss on your front porch
I'm dead now, check my chest you'll see
The light has been mined from me, burned for the heat
Oh I'm dead now can you hear the relief
As life's belligerent symphonies finally cease
Oh, we're all dead now, join hands and we'll sing
To the glory of hell and the virtue of sin oh
There's something wrong with me
There's something wrong with me
And it reads nothing like poetry
So will you love me spite of these
Ties and inconsistencies
There is something wrong with me
Oh theres something wrong with me,
Oh it reads nothing like poetry
Ah will you love me spite of these
Ties and inconsistencies
There is something wrong with me<start>I see you walkin' as you're walkin' by
I gotta wonder, gotta wonder why
I'm gonna give it to you just one more time
'Cause baby, when I see your face
You take me away to that special place
Take me away and you're tellin' me that you're mine
You're never ever gonna see
That baby, it's just you and me
Come on, baby girl, now you're so fine
Come on, baby, take my hand
Come on, girl, you've gotta understand
That I'm going away so that I can be with you
We're gonna
Here we go, here we go, boom, boom, boom
Clearin' the room, starin' like a goon
If you're under the zero sound you will be soon
Estamos trayendo mucho ruido
Why no pueden decir nada
'Bout the phunk style that we do, we get down
I thought forever, happiness it was so close to me
Happiness too good to be, too good to be, too good to be, yeah, yeah
I swore I'd always have you by my side
But now, I know, I was just along for the ride, the ride, oh, yeah
Fumondo mota just ain't no thing
Why acabo de suber tu madre just the same yeah
I got, I got my boys, we came to make noise
And everybody's gonna be down with the phunk sound
Be together, I thought forever, well, happiness is so close to me
Happiness too good to be, too good to be, too good to be, yeah, yeah
I swore I'd always have you by my side
But now, I know, I was just along for the ride
You heard it once before, come one and hear it again
Bitches ain't shit, but hoes and trix yeah, yeah, yeah
One, two, everybody lemme go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go
You tore me all apart, you put me right in two
Well, nothing was there like it was supposed to
But fuck it, forget it because nothing's the same
I'm moving up in life making myself a name
Push me around, do what you gotta do
You cold-hearted bitch, I gotta big fuck you
Movin' up in life and I'm forgettin' about you
Can't you see, you fuckin' bitch we're through?
Yeah, yeah and I'm forgettin' about you<start>To the misanthropic misbegotten merchants of gloom
Who look into their crystal balls and prophesied our doom:
"Let the death knell chime, its the end of time"
Let the cynics put their blinkers on and toast our decline.
Don't become demoralized by scurrilous complaint,
Its a sure sign that the old world is terminally quaint.
And tomorrow's gonna be a better day,
No matter what the siren voices say
Tomorrow's gonna be a better day,
We're going to make it that way.
To the pessimistic populists who harbor no doubt,
That everything we make our way, "to hell in a hand cart".
To the snarky set, who's sniping to get,
Anyone who puts their head above the parapet.
Don't become disheartened baby, don't be fooled,
Take it from someone who knows the glass is half full.
And tomorrow's gonna be a better day,
No matter what the siren voices say.
Tomorrow's gonna be a better day,
E're gonna make it that way.<start>She gave herself to me
She's gone away from me
Where is the heartbeat coming from?
Lost is the heartbeat where I come from
Lie awake when the morning comes and I taste the fear
I can't live on the breath you take but I still feel you
Where is the heartbeat coming from?
Lost is the heartbeat where I come from
Say goodnight to the mourning son
I'll say goodbye to you sleeping one
Please don't leave if I don't trust you, I'm alone for now
If I told you I was bottle fed, would you nurse me?
Where is the heartbeat coming from?
Lost is the heartbeat where I come from
Say goodnight to the mourning son
I'll say goodbye to you sleeping one
Dreamer of the dream
Dreamer of the dream

Say goodnight to the mourning son
I'll say goodbye to you sleeping one
One day she'll die for you mourning son
One day I'll lie with you sleeping one

Dreamer of the dream<start>The sky seems full
When you're in the cradle
The rain will fall
And wash your dreams
Stars are stars
And they shine so hard
Now you spit out the sky
Because it's empty and hollow
All your dreams
Are hanging out to dry
Stars are stars
And they shine so cold
I saw you climb
Shadows on the trees
We lost some time
After things that never matter
I caught that falling star
It cut my hands to pieces
Where did I put that box?
It had my name in it
I saw you climb
Shadows on the trees
We lost some time
After things that never matter
The cogs have clicked and
The clocks will have their say
In the making of a day
You came here late
Go home early
Who'll remember?
Now you've gone away
Gone away
Gone away<start>I've been told that I'm a nerd
They told me I was looking geeky
These people are freaking me out
Why do they abhor me?
Why do they always diss me
For no reason
No good reason
I'm tired of being politic
Living with my relatives
Don't wanna play a positive role
Don't take me seriously
Don't expect too much from me
I wish you would just leave me
Why won't you leave me alone?
Take off your nerdy glasses
You're gonna skip the classes
And so am I
Don't let them tell you
Who you are meant to be
Who you are supposed to be
You got to break free and run free<start>(You see the deal was, her parents would take care of the kid until they got their feet on the ground. Cause they both have full time jobs and weren't financially stable yet, so they say. But her mom would always ask, "when are you gonna pick up Dean?" the baby. And they'd say they didn't have the time or they weren't ready. Ya know time passed quick and he wasn't a baby anymore. None of them really had the heart to tell him that his parents were too busy for him, didn't have time for him. He never knew that his aunt and uncle were actually his mom and dad.)
So they never picked him up?
(No, but they did however send checks every week to pay for all his expenses.)
Well that's good, but I thought they couldn't afford it, that was why they couldn't pick him up right?
(Yeah)<start>Today's been nothing short of magic
Everything about today is magic, yeah
Like a breath of fresh air, I watch you standing there
Thanks for the time, picture frozen in my mind
Life's been a thorn in my side, forces me to incline
All to myself mission assigned
I'll have to see you again somewhere down the road
Oh, let me see you again before I explode
I'll spend all of my time, I'll search until I find
If I have to hunt you down, hunt you in the ground, yeah
Now as a broken man who never really had a plan
Don't have to prove to no one, hey
And there as it goes my purple rose
For my faults expose, case closed, yeah
I'll have to see you again somewhere down the road
Oh, let me see you again before I explode
I'll spend all of my time, I'll search until I find
If I have to hunt you down, hunt you in the ground, yeah
Whoa, yes, everything is magic, yeah, magic, yeah
Now come out of my dreams and into my world
Hey, honey, come inside this soul
Wherever you are, reveal yourself and understand
If I don't have you, there's nothing left
I'll have to see you again somewhere down the road
I'll have to see you again before I explode
I'll spend all of my time and I'll search until I find
If I have to hunt you down, hunt you, hunt you, hunt you down
Like a breath of fresh air, I watch you standing there
Thanks for the time, picture frozen in my mind
Life's been a thorn in my side, forces me to incline
All to myself mission assigned
I'll have to see you again somewhere down the road
Let me see you again before I explode

It will help someone concerned.
It's strength that comes along,
To let us know we're not alone.
David's faith put down a giant,
And it helped him be defiant.
He had faith in what he'd do,
And his aim was guided true.
Chorus:
Our faith helps guide us right,
And it lights the darkest night.
Our faith will give us strength,
In any battle we must fight.
Moses faith would part the sea,
When others said it couldn't be.
And its miracles has been seen,
Faith can help us see our dreams.
So if life gets you down,
Take time to look around.
If you will say a little prayer,
You might find faith is there.
Chorus:
Our faith helps guide us right,
And it lights the darkest night.
Our faith will give us strength,
In any battle we must fight.<start>Am I the caller of your keep
Am I the catcher of your fall
Am I the staller of your gaze
You leave me in a daze
You take your jump I'll make my leap
Feel freedom coming, we can have it all
We are the ones to lead the way
We'll leave them in a daze
We'll leave them in a daze
We'll leave them in a daze
We'll leave them in a daze
I Carried you down from the fortress
I don't know when to draw the line
That's not the way that you should do thee That's not the way that you should screw me
Make the jump or I'll take my leave
Just like icicles burning my eyes out
We are the ones to seize the day
I'll tell you that we'll leave them in a daze
Who will lead the way
Who will lead the way
Tell me while you leave them in a daze
Change your, change your ways
Just before I slip away I said
We'll leave them in a daze
Iwe, iwe, iwe, iwe<start>Get off my back, get off my back, get off my back
I wish you would go away today
You'd better stop calling me
You're starting to get real annoying
And I will call the cops if the ringing doesn't stop!<start>Did you feel small today when everyone had gone
'Cause I was beaten up and jaded by the news
And underneath the skin the truth is breaking through
So they just sewed me up and spit me out
And I can't change it
I can't change this
You you take away the world
And I don't even know myself now
So how can I know you
And I don't want to die
And I don't want to leave this place yet
Just give me one more try
My thoughts are floating as reality explodes
I'm whispering to each of you my friends
And every moment seems to freeze frame through the room
All the colors are electrified
But I can't see now
I can't see now
You you take away the world
And I don't even know myself now
So how can I know you
And I don't want to die
And I don't want to leave this place yet
Just give me one more try
And I'm drifting through myself again
Tell me how I got so high
Where the conscience bends the air is thin
And I can't change it
I can't change this
You you take away the world
And I don't even know myself now
So how can I know you
And I don't want to die
And I don't want to leave this place yet
Just give me one more try
And I don't want to die
And I don't want to leave this place yet
Just give me one more try
One more try, yeah
Just give me one more try
One more try, yeah
Just give me one more try<start>When the whistle blows
And the goodbye hugs are over
Then the train pulls out of the station
And rolls towards the dawn
With that old suitcase in hand
And a surefire plan gone over
This time it will work
It can't go wrong
'Cause I've got all of our dreams
Mixed up with my schemes
Rolling around in my mind
I know the sun's gonna shine
Shine on me this time
In a week or two
I'll be writing to you with good news
And I can just see your smile
As you read about all that I've done
'Cause I've got all of our plans
Right here in my hands
And things are gonna work out just fine
'Cause I know the sun's gonna shine
Shine on me this time
I've seen confusion in your eyes
I've seen uncertainty and fear
Keep on looking for tomorrow
Soon it will be here
This time, it's gonna be this time
This time, it's gotta be this time
This time, it's never never
This time, the day is coming
This time, it's never never
This time, the day is coming
This time, it's never never
This time, the day is coming<start>Radiation and gravity
For centuries now they have been haunting me
And when they're near, I feel it
I'm lost in fear, I can't quit now
Symbolic suicide
I feel the need to tranquillize
I dream then watch you
Burn in agony
I'm praying for Heaven
While living through Hell
A story of pain
That only I can tell
And when they're near, I feel it
I'm lost in fear, I can't quit now
I won't quit now
I can't quit
Symbolic suicide
I feel the need to tranquillze
I dream then watch you burn
Symbolic suicide
I dream then watch you
Don't do as I, just hear my words
Don't live as I, my lesson's learned<start>It's coming down
It's coming down
It's raining outside
You've nowhere to hide
She's asking you why you think it's funny
It's coming down

She's leaving your house
She had to get out
She's mad and she'll take her mattress with her

Promise calls, promise falls, what are we to do with a clouded view
You follow me through
Sadly the tides are changing, my world slips out of you
Your body falls, my body calls, what are we to do with a clouded view
You follow me through
My life's turning pages, I see a promised day
Watchmen never age here, they just sleep in vain
Drowning people stare here, they don't care to call
So I rebury the pages, Kthulhu calls
You'll see, you'll see her when she starts to form
You'll see, you'll see her when she starts to call
In the name of Jesus Christ, won't you fear my name
I've been around since Moses, your preacher never came
You'll see, you'll see her when she starts to form
You'll see, you'll see her when she starts to call
Follow me
You sleep, you sleep
Follow me
It's just another day, remember I'm calling for you
Just another day, remember she's calling for you
Just another day, Kthulhu, I'm calling for you
Just another day, An empire has fallen from view
You sleep, you sleep
You cannot follow me!<start>Who's lonely now? Which one of us is suffering?
Who's in his cups? Which one of us recovering?
Who likes to look at pictures and cries, but way too late?
Who doesn't want to change a thing, accepting it was fate?
The wrong man was convicted, you know I did the deed.
I thought that you would wait for me, your wants I needn't heed.
The wrong man lies beside you and waits for you to wake,
And all because I lacked conviction, the judgment's my mistake.
Who's breathless now? Who only hyperventilates?
Who'd die for you? Who's dying inside anyway?
Which one of us is sunshine and which one's growing dim?
When two men dream of you at night, do you just dream of him?
The wrong man was convicted, you know I did the deed.
I thought that you would wait for me, your wants I needn't heed.
The wrong man lies beside you and waits for you to wake,
And all because I lacked conviction, the judgment's my mistake.
Who's lonely now? Who's reaching out to no one?
Who's lonely now? It takes one to know one
I changed my mind, you said that I could change it back.
I wanted space, and now change has fallen through the cracks.
If I'm again beside your body, don't tell me where it's been,
It's cruel, unusual punishment to kiss fingerprinted skin.
The wrong man was convicted, you know I did the deed.
I thought that you would wait for me, your wants I needn't heed.
The wrong man lies beside you and waits for you to wake,
And all because I lacked conviction, the judgment's my mistake.
It's my mistake
It's my mistake.<start>Can ye no hush your weepin'
All the wee lambs are sleepin'
Birdies are nestlin' nestlin' together
Dream Angus is hirplin' oer the heather
Dreams to sell, fine dreams to sell
Angus is here wi' dreams to sell
Hush ye my baby and sleep without fear
Dream Angus has brought you a dream my dear.
List' to the curlew cryin'
Faintly the echos dyin'
Even the birdies and the beasties are sleepin'
But my bonny bairn is weepin' weepin'<start>I still remember how I fell for you
There wasn't one thing I would not do
I still recall the love in your eyes
Blue like the sky on a clear sunrise
And it was Real At The Time
Real At The Time
I was yours you were mine
It was Real At The Time
You were a lioness tall and lean
You were the best thing I'd ever seen
I heard a loneliness in your voice
I charged ahead I had no choice
Cause it felt Real At The Time
Real At The Time
Like a mountain you climb
It felt Real At The Time
And babe you meant so much to me
I never will forget your face
I never will forget those nights
Those nights
Those nights
Lost in the pettiness and the fights
Lost in the battle for bragging rights
We were a couple of kindred souls
Fighting for childish things like control<start>I see the end, and I see the end well it was open so I crawled inside
And someone up ahead was crying, well someone up ahead was dying
Lost in the darkness, lost in today
Well you can only lose it to your mind, you got to lose it to your mind
Waves and waves of tranquility is hard on your innocence
Discarding all that was before, let's crawl inside
La virginal souls devour without shame, we lick our lips clean, so clean
No one outside knows, no one outside knows what it means
To me, to be, set free
Well you can only lose it to your mind, you got to lose it to your mind
Waves and waves of tranquility is hard on your innocence
Discarding all that was before, let's crawl inside<start>Words and music by Arlo Guthrie
In the event of my demise
Be sure to include this statement
When you are bent on closing my eyes
Thinking about what my life meant
Alone on a hill back in '65
Things looked a lot like changing
Singing our songs that we harmonized
Dreaming of worlds rearranging
And I don't know why I'm singing tonight
Maybe it's time someone told you
Just because you say you've seen the light
Doesn't mean nobody sold you
I can remember all of your smiles
During the demonstrations
Taking on what seemed like the whole world
Igniting the hearts of our nations
And together we sang our victory songs
Though we were worlds apart
Every thing then has now passed away
Except for the love in my heart
Sitting at home on computerized beds
Tryine to come to conclusions
Seeing reflections from rose-colored heads
Ignoring the states of illusion
Drunk in a world of material wealth
No one can notice you falling
Fantastic flights once good tor your health
Now make you deaf to your calling
And all alone the prophet groans
With words as yet unseen
Who'll be awake when the master returns
Who will be lost in their dreams
So in the event of my demise
8e sure to include this statement
Only the words of love kept alive
Are worthy of not being wasted<start>I have had my fun if I never get well no more.
I have had my fun if I never get well no more.
All of my health is failing;
Lord I'm going down slow
I'm going down slow.
Please write my mother and tell her the shape I'm in.
Please write my mother and tell her the shape I'm in.
Tell her to pray for me
Forgive me for my sin
For all of my sin.
On the next train south look for my clothes back home.
On the next train south, look for my clothes back home.
Cause all of my health is failing
Lord, I'm going down slow,
I'm going down slow.
All of my health is failing
Lord, I'm going down slow,
I'm going down slow.
Feel like I'm going, like I'm going down slow.
I feel like I'm going, like I'm going down slow.
I feel like I'm going, like I'm going down slow.

I feel like I'm going, like I'm going down slow<start>Walk down the realm
Hint to no one that this
Generic bond exists
Evil shows another side
And like before, makes no sense
Never coming, always leaving
Right before
Hooked on substance,
Digging deeper
Can't reveal
Why we leave
Well enough alone
Never thought about the shame
So fed up,
What's with the scenes?
Observe and leave instead
This pity wagon
Penetrates my skin
So sensitive, it makes me sick
And like before, makes no sense
Never coming, always leaving
Right before
Hooked on substance,
Digging deeper
Can't reveal
Why we leave
Well enough alone
Never thought about the shame
The old and the aged
Pulled and never knew what hit
The old and the aged
Pulled and never knew
And like before, makes no sense
Never coming, always leaving
Right before
Hooked on substance,
Digging deeper
Can't reveal
Why we leave
Well enough alone
Never thought about the shame
Why we leave
Well enough alone
Never thought about the shame
When you leave
When you leave<start>You know it always felt so right
Holding you throughout the night
I thought you'd always care
I know that feelings change
And now you've thrown away
The love that we once shared
They said it would be so easy
They told me how I'd find someone new
Don't you think you'll ever need me, like I need you
Chorus:
I'm losing, losing my heart over you
Repeat (1x)
I know you never had the time
To know this heart of mine
I need to feel your love
And now it always seems
Day and night I have these dreams
It's you i'm thinking of
I know it sounds so foolish
Here I am with a broken heart
Oh, why, can't I be with someone like you
Chorus (2x)
I know it sounds so foolish
Here I am with a broken heart
Oh, why, can't I be with someone like you
Chorus (3x)<start>Battered and torn
Still I can see the light
Tattered and worn
But I must kneel to fight
Friend of mine
What can't you spare
I know some times
It gets cold in there
When my legs no longer carry
And the warm wind chills my bones
I reach for Mother Mary
And I shall not walk alone
Hope is alive
While we're apart
Only tears
Speak from my heart
Break the chains
That hold us down
And we shall be
Forever bound
When I'm tired and weary
And a long way from home
I reach for Mother Mary
And I shall not walk alone
Beauty that
We left behind
How shall we
Tomorrow find
Set aside
Our weight in sin
So that we
Can live again
When my legs no longer carry
And the warm wind chills my bones
I reach for Mother Mary
And I shall not walk alone<start>Time to kill and cut to size

C-ing how long we could stay outta jail is how we'd
That's how we'd compete
We never owned the streets that we keep defending
So the $ we got we just end up spending
With nothing 2 save & not a thing 4 lending
U're never really happy
Just really good
At pretending
Everybody in the world wants 2 b a star
Few got what it takes 2 get that far
If a rocketship didn't cost more than a car
A brother might move

I heard you call my name
And the roar o the engine
Was calling me to blame
Tears in my mirror
Crying for the people behind us
But I know, I wont let you go
Oh No
Here comes that Feeling again
Im wrapping my dreams around you
And our love is in it again
After all weve been through
And I know theres a place inside of my home
That the road will never find
And Im afraid the approaching headlights
Will someday leave me blind
You shatter my mirror
Buying off the forces that drive me on
And tonight, I wont let you go
Oh no
Here comes that Feeling again
Im wrapping my dreams around you
And our love is in it again
After all weve been through
Baby climb into the night time
Girl this moment is the right time
Drivin on and Im still hungry
To make the next town
And this roads the only
Thing that could bring us down
If it keeps me drivin
I swear Ill never leave you behind
And I know, I cant let you go
Oh no
Here comes that Feeling again
Im wrapping my dreams around you
And our love is in it again
After all weve been through
Here comes that feeling again
Here comes that feeling again<start>Midnight in the Holy City
Playground for restless souls
Graveyards for the sons of Ft. Sumpter
And the ghostly daughters
Wait for their boys to come home
Moonlight in the Holy City
So thick it warms the air
Burned my heart on a sweet southern flame
Like a hug from your mama saying it will be OK
Spilt my blood, in the Holy City
Seen the flood of a thousand rains
I ran away from the Holy City
Heard the spirits in the steeple singing
You'll be back again
Sunrise in the Holy City
The kings and queens shuffle by
I'm born here of my own ashes
Just lay me down here when I die<start>For Thanksgiving we had 'tatas,
Succotash and rutabagas.
Then came turkey from the oven.
Broke the wishbone.
Covenants were sealed and set.
On the losing end of a wishbone,
And I won't pretend not to mind.
Christmas Eve we ate at Aunty's.
We had some ham glazed with honey.
Rolled the Yule log on the fire.
Threw the hambone to the dogs and went to bed.
On the losing end of a wishbone,
And I won't pretend not to mind.
In the morning the weathercock was heard
Asking what we had learned of the Earth.
"Is it a round place with deserts and oceans,
Housing as many winds as one might wish?"
We were standing by the gate.
He said, "Oh my, it's getting late!"
Then he took off flying to the south
With a black snake in his mouth.
You can shake it, break it, or glue it whole,
No two ways about it with a broke wishbone
On the losing end.
For St. Patrick's we had cabbage,
Corned beef stew, egg salad sandwich.
Then came whiskey from the basement.
Danced all night into the dawn,
Then held our heads.
On the losing end of a wishbone,
And I won't pretend not to mind.<start>The land of race car ya-yas

When I saw you for the first time
I felt my heartbeat growing stronger
You came to me just like a vision of hope
And I knew we'd be together somehow
You gotta know
You're all I want
Only you make me feel
I don't have to die
To go to heaven
Baby, baby, you know I need you
Just like I need the air I breathe
You changed my life
You wake up my feelings
I never knew love, I was blind
Now I see that
You stole my heart
Anytime you're not right next to me
I'm so afraid you'll stay away
There is no way to go easy
with love
It can be so dangerous
But it's time I must try
You gotta know
you're all I want
Only you make me feel
We don't have to die
To go to heaven<start>Feeling like I need to fall down some stairs
Maybe lay face down in the river and float
Perfect weather for a head wound
Or studying sophisticated nuances of putting holes in your lungs
One fifty Marilyns, the war and the bomb
All reasons to be fearful but every day still new to wake up
Three hundred and thirty three, say that they knew me
Three hundred and thirty three, bring it all back to me
All the devils that you don't know
Can all come along for the ride
I wanna be as close as I can get to you
All the devils that you don't know
Can all come along for the ride
I wanna be as close as I can get to you
I saw the 'Renown Orders of the Night' in person
Why would I ever meet that with irony or cynicism?
Planned views and elevations walking through your tarot garden
Visible mutations fading right before your fucking eyes
Cycles of death and regeneration, sensations of absence and loss
Wish you had been there by my side to see it all
Three hundred and thirty three, say that they knew me
Three hundred and thirty three, bring your love back to me
All the devils that you don't know
Can all come along for the ride
I wanna be as close as I can get to you

Oh I hope it's not out of reach
It's very beautiful
Come my little peach
Together we'll go down to nude beach

And find another way
Before you go it alone, you gotta learn to let to let it go
Face another day

Home movies, cold U.V.'s more groovies
Waiting for a ticket of leave
Some learners get nervous, the perverts
All want to play with Eve
Sat back to look at your cracked actors
Drowning in a sea of smiles
Blue doorways lead four ways they always
Said you were a lonely child
Poor baby, poor baby
Poor baby, too tough to talk to me
Inspection, correction, rejection
Caught in a cul-de-sac
Ignition, collision, admission
That you want to double back
Poor baby, don't listen, had visions
What life is really like
You waited, debated, delayed it
Then you shut your eyes
Poor baby, poor baby
Poor baby, too tough to talk to me
You found out, your big out leaves no doubt
You've lost your head in the skies!
Striped lady, she's crazy, picks daisies
She's got the neon eyes
Give money, it's funny you dummy
Baked your cake and ate it too
The truth is that sometimes
Just one time can be enough with you!
Poor baby, poor baby
Poor baby, too tough to talk to me

It's happenin' over again
As the day is long they keep movin' on
Laughin' at the notion of a signal light
Knew we'd gone too far
No one knew what happened but it seemed alright
We quickly jumped in the car
All through my head it's happenin' over again
King of the road says you move too slow!<start>I'm not one who can complain
because no one's perfect,
you think you're so smart.
You rented me as if I could be returned,
but now you've gone too far.
What ya gonna see,
what ya gonna say,
what ya gonna do,
When nothing ever works out, just like you want it to?
Yeah, we've had our times of ups and downs,
but too often you repeat yourself
But I didn't stutter when I let it happen,
I just didn't trust myself.
All this time you think you're right,
it's in your head,
it's in your head I'm certain
Don't even think to waste my time,
because now you're gone and I'm a better person.
Washed up and lonely now,
you're so used to trusting all of your own lies.
But I should have know you better,
when you chose your poison over your friends' lives.
All this time you think you're right,
it's in your head,
it's in your head I'm certain
Don't even think to waste my time,
because now you're gone and I'm a better person.
You don't even know you're wrong,
unless killing your friends is right.
But you'll keep going on, living in a world of lies.
All this time you think you're right,
it's in your head,
it's in your head I'm certain
Don't even think to waste my time,
because now you're gone and I'm a better person.
All this time you think you're right,
it's in your head,
it's in your head I'm certain
Don't even think to waste my time,
because it's in your head.<start>Another man done gone.
Another man done gone.
Another man done gone, another man done gone, another man done gone.
On the country farm.
He's on the country farm, on the country farm, he's on the country farm.
Another man done gone.
Another man done gone, another man done gone, another man done gone.
I don't know his name.
Didn't know his name, I didn't know his name, I didn't know his name.<start>Follow the way
Follow the way
Holding mother
Follow the way
Follow the way
Knew we'd come through to stay
What have I learned?
All life, it never goes away
You never will betray
When words have gone away
Remember Namaste
Follow the way
Follow the way
Holding father<start>I climbed your arms
Then you pulled away
A new cavity moved into
My heart today
The more she sings
The more it seems
Now I'm
Now I'm through
With the new you
Now I'm through
With the new you
New you
I drove you home
Then you moved away
New cavity moved into
My heart today
The more I scream
The more it seems
That I'm through
Now I'm through
With the new you
Now I'm through
With the new you
Now I'm through
With the new you
New you<start>Here is the deal, you must find guesses in this room.
Cut around the block,
Shake in the boots we stocked,
I'll turn your onset to off.
Cause with patience and much practice of keeping all this clean.
Wipe the floor with rust,
Abigail's lost touch and it makes for scattered debris.
For nine years and square stars, tonight we have it all made.
For nine months, lets make much
All the bells were out of unison.
I knew not why the latitude carried on and all of our signs were made to pray to synagogues.
I was built on binds of paperback,
I knew not if the stories were told or tought.
And all of our knees were carved in sand from Leningrad.
"On", said the rod and reel, and "not a drop to drink".
"But we do", as we say, "and I'll do as I've said
Until my tongue parts the sea."
"On", said that self-defense texture of the reed.
"And it climbs, and it sings"<start>Ed's Uncle Elwyn
Ed's Uncle Elwyn
Oh, Ed's Uncle Elwyn
My Uncle Elwyn is tall
My Uncle Elwyn is small
My Elwyn plays mean basketball
He's about 45, maybe 55, 60
I'm not sure, once he fixed me
A drink, I was about 5 years old
It was Kool-Aid and pop,
I thought that was cold.
Cold meaning good,
Cold's supposed to be bad
But I thought I would change some things
I'd change their meanings
I've been demeaning,
Once, twice maybe three times
I asked my uncle Elwyn,
He's a mime he said:
Ed's Uncle Elwyn
That's E-L-W-Y-N that's Elwyn, sing it again
That's E-L-W-Y-N that's Elwyn, sing it again
That's E-L-W-Y-N that's Elwyn, sing it again
That's E-L-W-Y-N that's Elwyn, that's my Uncle

Collecting dust, yeah, kicking up blood
That was then when we were both people,
Doing people things like collecting dreams
They knew gold and pure
All your archest are so plainly
That was in when we were both blind,
Taking what was blind
Killing all the time
We're the same with new intentions
We're the same with bad intentions
Hey little darling girl
You're sweet with your heart in our hand
Look what we've done, never been more blind
Every day singing prayers
We're saying we are blameless
Making love on summer days yeah
Making love feels good to me
Shaking up on hollow ?lace
Saying up feels good to me
That was in when we were both evil
Doing evil things like stifle and scream
We are good now, we are blameless
We are wrong now, we are shameless<start>Man msste eigentlich jetzt dauernd lustig sein
wo doch immer so viele sthnen
Allein schon um zu zeigen - ich bin auf keinen Fall einer von denen
Die Deutschen sind depressiv - was ist bloss schiefgelaufen
Das soviele Menschen hier die Musik von Grnemeyer kaufen.
Die Jugend ist scheinbar verbldet - die Lehrer sind ausgebrannt
Wie konnte das nur geschehen im Dichter- und Denkerland
Und wir fragen uns, was die Zukunft bringt
Und die Antwort kennt nur der Wind
Doch wir sind sicher - es wird aufwrts gehen
Wenn wir erst wieder Weltmeister sind
Wir werden Weltmeister sein ...
Und die geistig-moralische Wende - die wir damals herbeiriefen
Der Geist und die Moral sind weg, nur die Schulden sind geblieben
Und alle stehen da und fragen sich wo die fetten Jahre geblieben sind
Doch wir sind sicher es wird aufwrts gehen wenn wir erst wieder Weltmeister sind.
Wir werden Weltmeister sein...
Jetzt kommt's auf jeden einzelnen von uns an
Damit die Mannschaft wieder funktioniert
Wir drfen beim Elfmeterschieen
Jetzt nicht die Nerven verlieren
Und wir fragen uns wie das Spiel ausgeht
(und) die Antwort kennt nur der Wind
Wir werden fair zu den Verlierern sein
Hauptsache - wir gewinnen
Wir werden Weltmeister sein<start>The roof the roof the roof is on fire
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn
Burn motherfucker burn
Burn burn burn burn
Just a little and nothing now it's over
Just a little and nothing now it's over
What you said no
You're never gonna say again
In your own special way you tear me down
Sway so hypnotic
Neither up nor down
Just been turned and turned
It just sits inside so it burns and burns
If I can't decide what makes you hurt
In your own special way you tear me down
So ask me please, please
Give me something good, now
Something
Give me something good, now
Give me
Come sway this way<start>Have you ever been alone in a corner
With no way out but forward?
Have to dig deep down inside you
Dig up a smile
The one you love doesn't know it
And you feel if you ever show it
You'll destroy things so you go it
Alone in life
You're the cure
For everything that hurts me
You're the cure
My pain dies when you smile
Lost for words
The closer you come to me
Like a bird
My heart soars free and wild.
Hard to go into this long life
Never once holding ye
Between my shoulders I feel you sigh with joy
Your sweet breath upon my neck
I so wanna protect ye
Have you ever been haunted?
Do you know what it means to be haunted
By the vision of the one you wanted
And feel your frailty?
Have you ever felt cheated
When you're far from the one you can't be with?
You catch them watching you
And you're greeted with possibility
You're the cure
For everything that hurts me
You're the cure
My pain dies when you smile
Lost for words
The closer you come to me
Like a bird
My heart soars free and wild.
Hard to go into this long life
Never once holding ye
Between my shoulders I feel you sigh with joy
Your sweet breath upon my neck
I so wanna protect ye
I feel your hand glide inside my shirt
Smooth on my back
The thump thump of two little drums
In a mystical musical dawn
Yeah, yeah, just give me one night
And I'll be glad if you want
I wanna hold you oh so bad
I never told you
Sometimes I wish I had
Almighty love
Almighty love
Almighty love
Almighty love
Almighty love<start>Come, now, come with me
Look around and you'll see what I mean
I can't help thinking what to say
I have this problem every day with you
If you stay with me
You'll wonder why you never came here before
You'll maybe want to come again
If you do, just tell me - I'll be there
Tell the nation, all about the other world
Tell the people, let them come when they will
Soft vibrations, from a place that everyone needs
Tell the people, let them come when they will
Here... here now they come
They... want to do what has to be... done
If they leave, I'm back again, see them running through the streets
In the early morning, clutching on with the sunlight
Morning air brings love, love, love... if they, they, they... if they leave...
Turn back, tell them, catch the sun, and then cease, you're the one
that won't see peace, tell them of the falling into fallen players...
Have your love come into me, lover, falling into smaller times, I will hurl... again...
And now...
Tell the nation, all about the other world
Tell the people, let them come when they will
Soft vibrations, from a place that everyone needs
Tell the people, let them come when they will<start>Breathing
Your normal nico-teenager
Learning less of lessons
Every time he talks
Now it seems
I care more about caring less
Writing what meant what
And asking not
Is your autumn attic full?
Am I your automatic fool?
Singing
His life in swinging mind
Wanting more of morning glory
After sleeping in
Now it seems
I care more about caring less
Then I was used to (less than I used to)
Then I used
you
Is your autumn attic full?
Am I your automatic fool?
Sundown
Two to go
The player
and the role
Sundown
Two to go
The prayer
and the soul
Sundown
Two to go
I've seen the scene
And its nothing but its shows
Verdict guilty :
Grand theft autumn.<start>This is all your fault, she said, your troubles and your tears
This is all your fault and you and me all ends right here
Did I let you down
Did I let you walk away
Everything we make we break apart
This is what you get, the lies politely disappear
Did you forget the way we carried on for years
Did I let you down
Did I let you walk away
Everything we make we break apart
And it's all your fault<start>No me preguntes si anoche
Estuve en casa dormido
Tampoco que hacÃ­Â­a mi coche
En la puerta del bar del olvido
No preguntes si es que estaba
De fiesta con los amigos
Que mis respuestas son balas
Para tu corazÃ³n herido
Pero si me dejas esta noche yo te doy
Todos los besos que te debo
Ya sÃ© que siempre digo que empiezo a partir de hoy
y que luego nunca me atrevo
Pero si me dejas yo te canto una bossanova
y no te voy a dejar
Ni un minuto sola
Si te dejas llevar como el mar lleva a las olas
Hasta las rocas
No preguntes por quÃ© huele
Mi camiseta a pachulÃ­
Ni que ruido de mujeres
Se escuchaba cuando me llamaste al mÃ³vil
Que hay tragos que son amargos
Hasta los del mejor vino
Unos cortos, otros largos,
Pero todos son daÃ±inos<start>Strange things have happened,
Like never happened before.
My baby told me
I would have to go.
I can't be good no more,
Like I once did before.
I can't be good no more, baby,
Honey, because the world is goin' wrong.
Feel bad this morning,
Ain't got no home.
No use to worry,
'Cause the whole world is goin' wrong,
I can't be good no more,
Once like I did before.
I can't be good no more, baby,
Honey, because the world is goin' wrong.
I told you, baby,
Right to your head,
If I didn't leave you
I would have to kill you dead.
I can't be good no more,
Once like I did before.
I can't be good no more, baby,
Honey, because the world is goin' wrong.
If you have a woman
And she wont be kind,
Praise to the Good Lord
To get her out of your mind.
I can't be good no more,
Once like I did before.
I can't be good no more, baby,
'Cause the world is goin' wrong.
When you've been good,
You can't do no more,
Just tell her kindly,
"There's the front door."
I can't be good no more,
Once like I did before.
I can't be good no more, baby,
Honey, 'cause the world is goin' wrong.
(?)Pack up my suitcase,
And give me my hat,
I ain't no need to ask you, darling(?)
I ain't comming back.
I can't be good no more,
Honey, like I once did before.
I can't be good no more, baby,
Honey, 'cause the world is goin' wrong.<start>Don't leave me now
Now that I need you
How blue and lonely I'd be
If you should say we're through
Don't break my heart
This heart that loves you
They'll just be nothing for me
If you should leave me now
What good is dreamin'
If I must dream all alone by myself
Without you darling
My arms would gather dust
Come to these arms
These arms that need you
Don't close your eyes to my plea
Don't leave me now.<start>You better run You better run and run and run
You better run You better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run You better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You stand before your maker
In a state of shame
Bacause your robes are covered in mud
While your kneel at the feet
Of a woman of the street
The gutters will run with blood
They will run with blood!
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
In the days of madness
My brother, my sister
When you're dragged toward the Hell-mouth
You will beg at the end
But there ain't gonna be one, friend
For the grave will spew you out
It will spew you out!
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You'll be working in the darkness
Against your fellow man
And you'll find you're called to come forth
So you'll scrub and you'll scrub
But the trouble is, bud
The blood it won't wash off
No, it won't come off!
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run and run and run
You better run to the City of Refuge<start>How many bands have wrote this song before?
I can name at least fifty
I bet you could name a hundred more.
There's over a couple thousand chord progressions around
Will someone tell me who decided
They'd run this one into the ground?!
I'm putting a stop to it once and for all
I'm putting my fist right through the wall
I'm telling you one and all
You better not write this stupid song again
"I've got a little plan, so listen up
We could write a four chord wonder
And make a million bucks"
No need to mention names cause' you know who you are.
Take word of my advice or I'll break your guitar
I think it's time to set things straight
I just write the song I hate.
And, I'll write it again and again and again<start>Kanji

Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready

I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way

Ready, set, go
I got a better way
The stars in your eyes
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
See my life in a comic
Like the way they did the Bible
With the bubbles and action
The little details in color
First a horseback bomber
Just a small thin chance
Like seeing Jesus on Dateline

What have I become
Reach to the preacher
Is there nothing else to feel
That I can't find
And all my questions that I sought
In my mind
I gave up my voice cause I can't favor
Well I can't follow
What if I had some
What if I had some sound again
Come on maker
Is this something that I'm missing
That I have lost
And all my trust is being wasted out at sea
And I can't find it
Waiting around for my angels to say nothing
That I can't follow
What if I had some
What if I had some sound again
Well I have the seed
With half love again
Give up my voice cause I can't favor
Well I can't follow
And all my angels have been wasted out at sea
When I can't find it
Come on maker
Is this something that I'm missing<start>Twelve o'clock
No one around
Traces of shoes
On the ground
Rainy days
Darkness and haze
Puddles and dirt
Days are so short
Nights are long
Going slow
Tonight ain't windy
The nature is greedy
Noise of the package
My senses are damaged
Gloomy and scary
Just crap or something to me<start>Painted doll, on a painted stage
Painted doll, on a painted stage
She's just a one-man Punch and Judy show
For caliphs twice her age
Painted doll, on a painted stage
The more they look at her
The less I see
The more they look at her
The less I see
It's a tricky situation when some
Parasite has got my painted doll
And she's got me
Lookin' down Sydney Harbour in the rain
My pretty baby's slappin' up another vein
If this is gonna be her final wage
My heart may never see this world again
She's my little sick salome
And it's breakin' me in two
Painted doll
I've got a deal for you<start>Jerry, go to bed
Close your eyes and sleep
Good night
Dream just tasty dreams
Forget the shouts and screams
It wasn't your fault
Fly with diamond stars
Hear the silence around
It's so deep
Tommorow will bring
The time to face your fears
and memories
Remember those few things
All you need is right here
If you lose your way
You can come back to me
And that mommy will always love you
Don't you fear!<start>Estrella de mar
Beber de tu boca es como andar
Encima de un mar de luz y silencio
Estrella de mar
Mirarte a los ojos es nadar,
Nadar en un mar mas frio que el hielo
El mar junto al cual yo fui a nacer
Mi estrella fugaz
En un dia gris del mes de febrero
Tu y yo nos abrazamos
Estrella de mar,
Dormir en tus brazos es viajar
A un mundo irreal perdido en el tiempo
Estrella de mar,
Sentir el contacto de tu piel
Es amanecer en un mar abierto
El mar junto al cual yo fui a nacer
Mi estrella fugaz
En un dia gris del mes de febrero Tu y yo nos abrazamos<start>Hiding notes in a secret place
I know it so
Close my eyes and see aeroplanes
And so it goes
Crossing numbers and counting days
For you to see
Fingers move and anticipate
I skip a beat
Hand me your eyes
Oversized
I can see through
My disguise
I'm with you when I'm by myself
At least I feel like its true with a little help
And can you tell;
My heart beats faster when you speak
And do you know heaven comes only for a week
And then it goes
Hand me your eyes
Oversized
I can see through
My disguise
Show me your mind
Hypnotise
Cover your mood
Heavy lies<start>dont ask questions

With the rich on one side and the poor on the other
There's an ocean between them before your eyes
Is all of humanity ready to rise up
You are standing for love in the land
And all the people are searching for something
There's a notion that all can fulfill their dreams
Of living in freedom with all of their families
In your open arms giving grace
Holy palms wiping their faces of tears
To see your face and your open heart
Is comforting all of our fears
Jesus of Rio
And if everyone opened their eyes they'd see
That loving feeling is waiting within us
And if everyone opened their hearts they'd see
That every human is holy to someone
With your open arms giving grace
Holy palms wiping their faces of tears
To see your face and your open heart
Is comforting all of our fears
You are standing on top of the world
A sacred symbol of love everlasting
Devotion can lift us up to the skies
With all of humanity ready to rise up<start>All of the voices
Spelling it out
Where are the plans you're thinking about
Rest him assured
It comes overnight
Writing it down and tearing it up
If I could tell you
Gradually
Word by word, you'd take it from me
It would be over
Instantly
Landing us where you thought we would be<start>Don't say no to me daddy
Don't

My happiness
Is this a test?
Please let me rest

Is this a test?
Do you think I'm blessed?
I'm such a mess (Repeat 3x)
Is this a test? (Repeat 8x)
Oh holy shit (Repeat 5x)<start>You walked away in silence
You walked away to breathe
Stopped and turned around to say goodbye to me
I'm pleading as you're leaving I'm begging you to stay
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
If my life is the price, then my life it will cost
Now that I'm picking up the pieces see the pain that I have caused
It's hard to believe in someone you thought was lost
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't you walk away in silence
In tears you counted reasons
Tears covered you it seemed
Face down screaming "God help me please"
I'm pleading as you're leaving I'm begging you to stay
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
If my life is the price, then my life it will cost
It will cost my life
Now that I'm picking up the pieces see the pain that I have caused
It's hard to believe in someone you thought was lost
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't you walk away in silence
Please come back to me
Don't you walk away in silence
I'm not the man I used to be!
Well I pray that tomorrow you'll be home
We can rebuild and forever we can go on
Go on, and go on
We can go on, well I pray that tomorrow you'll be home
Look at horizons and let the light bring you home (home), bring you home
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
If my life is the price, then my life it will cost
It will cost my life
Now that I'm picking up the pieces see the pain that I have caused
It's hard to believe in someone you thought was lost
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't walk away in silence
Please don't walk away
Don't walk away in silence
I'm not the man I used to be!<start>Run, you still run, run with blood
- And your so-called faith -
On a circle line
Dont beat down
On a lost pride
A fading gracious beauty
Killing precious lives
With a white knife
And a black soul
We will feed you with thistless
And thats why were back
Youre locked away, locked away
And thats why were back
Youre locked away, locked away
And thats why were back
We will let you rise, within the cage, within the cage
Youll burn all your sins, like burning the purpose of life,
Whitin the cage
Un-dis-co-vered, Undiscovered air
Fleeting in, fleeting out
Thats why were back !
I just found the match that could set your house
Im kissing the grubs on your wounds
And Im feeling underfed
I just found the match that could set your house
Im feeding the grubs on your wounds
On, fire.
Theres remaining seats, but theres no one there to watch
Theres remaining seats, but theres no one there to watch us over
Yes, we will fight, together this time
Yes, we will fight, together this time<start>Everybody's gone away
Said they're movin' to L.A.
There's not a soul I know around
Everybody's leavin' town
Some caught a freight, some caught a plane
Found the sunshine lead the rain
They said this town will waste your time
I guess they're right, it's wasting mine
Some gotta win, some gotta lose
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
You know my heart keeps tellin' me
You're not a kid at thirty-three
Play around you'll lose your wife
Play too long you'll lose your life
Some gotta win, some gotta lose
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Some gotta win, some gotta lose

It's a miracle, I'm told.
Somehow I live to work.
So I hit the road.
Squeeze into my hybrid car,
Drive as fast as I can
While I scan the rooftops.
Yeah, I scan the rooftops.
Don't shoot, I'm a man.
So don't shoot, I'm a man.
I live in every city
All around the world.
Sometimes its way too hot.
Sometimes its friggin' cold.
One thing's always the same,
No matter what they say,
There's way too many problems.
Way, way too many problems.
Don't shoot, I'm a man.
Don't shoot, I'm a man.
You wish you were swinging from the trees.
You wish you were slicing through the breeze
You wish you were a king or a queen.
You wish you'd hit the lottery.
But wishin' is for chumps, high hopin' is for fools.
They'll hunt you down.
They'll taze you bro for playin' with the rules.
Don't shoot, I'm a man.
Don't shoot, I'm a man.
I've got a big dilemma
To punt or go for broke
It's got me goin' sleepless
Well I'm about to choke
Let me ask you something
Answer if you can
Think before you answer
There is no correct answer
So don't shoot, I'm a man.
Don't shoot, I'm a man.
Don't taze me bro!
Don't taze me bro!
Don't taze me bro!
Don't taze me bro!<start>Jack went out one stormy day
To see where his feet would go
They took him from his sleeping town
Across land both high and low
They took him through the velvet streets
Where men walked on their toes
And down the slopes
Where bottled hell
And blind men lie in rows
Jack walked through the treacle swamps
And crossed the salt dry plains
He passed he house where tall, thin dogs
Pulled on their iron chains
He heard the songs of seed germ girls
Who warmed the frozen fields
And as Jack walked
He felt the corn
Push up his tired heels
He saw the heathens' heather hills
He watched a boiling sea
He met a man with wooden hands
Carved from an old fruit tree
The old man said he dreamt at night
Of blossom roots and knives
And that night when
Jack went to sleep
He dreamt of damson pies
Jack walked out one stormy day
To see where his feet would go
They took him north, they took him east
But never took him home<start>Your cruel device
Your blood, like ice
One look, could kill
My pain, your thrill
I wanna love you but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much (too much)
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison, running through my veins
You're poison
I don't want to break these chains
Your mouth, so hot
Your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet
Black lace, on sweat
I hear you calling and it's needles and pins (and pins)
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
Don't want to touch you but you're under my skin (deep in)
I wanna kiss you but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison, running through my veins
You're poison
I don't want to break these chains
Poison
One look, could kill
My pain, your thrill
I wanna love you but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna to hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna to kiss you but I want it too much (too much)
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison, running through my veins
You're poison
I don't want to break these chains
Poison (poison)
I wanna love you but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much (too much)
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison
Yeah, well I don't want to break these chains
Poison (poison)
Runnin' deep inside my veins
Burnin' deep inside my brain (poison)
Poisoning (poison)
I don't want to break these chains (poison)
Poison
(Poison) I don't want to break these chains (poison)<start>[Chorus]
Can you be private when the juice is sweet
And the secret is crimson
Can you be quiet when my hands are heat
And the riptide rises?
Can you be blind and a beggar on your knees?
And live on our desire alone
Can you ride the tide in this insanity
And still keep as still as the shadows?
When the cry is so wide on the inside
When the truth jumps quick to the heart
When the wind or the stars are violent
Can you be silent?
Here's a little something that the wizard said:
"You can kiss, but never tell
All the wisdom you need
And you'll be needing some
Can be heard in the mouth of a seashell"
[Chorus]
Just the wide grey sky
And the hunchback moon
Will keep our memories
Not a living soul will remember us
This is just for you and me
'Cause if you;re out with the boys one night
If you;re out with the boys and there's braggin'
If you break, speak and call me your lover,
I'll lie, I swear, I'll lie, and it will all be over<start>I remember the clouds in the summer
And how the light kissed my eyes
When I was a child, it was always this
A life that I left behind
Remember the sun
Remember the rain
They're never gonna touch me again tonight
Cover my eyes tonight
Don't let me see the light
Forever the cold of the winter
Forever the moon in my eyes
Now that you're here, it is always this
I fall to the night and the sky
Forever I cry
Forever I cry
I don't need to run anymore tonight
Cover my eyes tonight
Don't let me see the light
All that we are
Never the same
All that we know is all that we need
Remember the sun
Remember the rain
They're never gonna touch me again tonight
Don't let me see the light
Don't let me see the light<start>Lately,
I know we're gonna break free
This time we'll rise so high
Fueled by desire
That fire
Burnt me today
I never wanna be lame
Make it
Ya I know were gonna take this
All the way
We'll feed the flame
With emotion,
Devotion
Gonna live for each day
I never wanna be lame
This is how I feel inside
I wanna do more than just survive
This is how I feel inside
I wanna do more than just survive
Racing,
Every moment that we're chasing
Face to face
You set the pace
With your desire
That fire
Burns in me today
I never wanna be lame
Make it
Ya I know that we can take this
All the way
We'll feed the flame
With emotion,
Devotion
And live for each day
I never wanna be lame
This is how I feel inside
I wanna do more than just survive
This is how I feel inside
I wanna do more than just survive
You're the one that I know
The only one that I hold
And we can't let this go
I won't let you go
Cause your all that I know
This is all that I know
Survive
Lately,
I know we're gonna break free
We're never gonna be
Strangers
In danger
Of fading away
We're never gonna be lame<start>I work on the highest floor
There's nothing in my way
But I saw my picture on the bathroom door today
I don't feel like working anymore, is that okay?
I'm so far in, I can't get out
So far in, I can't get out
So far in, I can't get out
I made it to the highest floor
By working every day
But I can't remember anymore what it was like to play
If I could only find the exit door, I'd run away
I'm so far in, I can't get out
So far in, I can't get out
So far in, I can't get out
Can't get out
Get out
Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up and go
Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up and go
Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up and go
Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up and go<start>I don't believe the things I'm seein'
I've been wonderin' 'bout some things I've heard
Everybody's crying mercy
When they don't know the meaning of the word
A bad enough situation
Is sure enough getting worse
Everybody's crying justice
Just as soon as there's business first
Toe to toe, touch and go
Give a cheer and get your own souvenir
Well you know the people running round in circles
Don't know what they're headed for
Everybody's crying peace on earth
Just as soon as we win this war
Straight ahead, gotta knock em dead
So pack your kit, choose your own hypocrite
You don't have to go to off-Broadway
To see something plain absurd
Everybody's crying mercy
When they don't know the meaning of the word
Nobody knows the meaning of the word<start>Worms of the earth
Rise in numbers
A silent night
Brings them upon us
Rising from the soil
To torment the living
Torment the living
Gentlemen, our faith is wounded
And yes, we are wounded too
They've come out from the swamp
But we, we stand on both legs
They will roll over
And over and over again
And another lonely pacifist
Lying in the sun
There is no ground control
(MAYDAY!)
Breathe not a word of this
Quiet, quiet confidence
The time has come to face this
We all must bear witness
The world will roll over
And over and over again
And another lonely pacifist
Dying in the sun
I will not watch this
I will not watch this all come down
Careful boy, careful...
Absence of heart makes a boy, a man, a monster

So avant-garde of mind
Standing in the last ditch
Where fallen heroes lie
Stand to the left of centre
Stand to the right sometimes

I'm looking under chairs
Been searching for an answer
Been searching everywhere
Yeah
Day by day
Hour by hour
Who's gonna fly my flag
In the corridors of power?
Your image is of virtue
Pure as driven snow
Your picture hangs in galleries
Your sin down in Soho
One day you'll meet the keeper
The keeper of your soul
One day in the next world
Your secrets will unfold
I'm looking under tables
I'm looking under chairs
Been searching for an answer
Been searching everywhere
Day by day
Hour by hour
Who's gonna fly my flag
In the corridors of power?
Day by day
Hour by hour
Who's gonna fly my flag
In the corridors of power?
One day in the future
Like Andy Warhol said
"Everybody will be famous
For fifteen minutes" then
Day by day
Hour by hour
Who's gonna fly my flag
In the corridors of power?
Day by day
Hour by hour
Who's gonna fly my flag
In the corridors of power?
Power
Corridors of power<start>Remember when you held my hand
Remember when you were my man

My mind was racing pacing the room
I don't know but I think I fell to pieces
The moment that I first saw you
Now it's true
I thought I could get over it
Brushed you off my shoulder but now
I'm a mess
Every day is worse and the hurt is always bringing me down
Help me
'Cause I don't know if I can take it
I'm so tired of trying to fake it
Tell me you know

I try to be cool but I want more
Now I'm standing right here at your front door
I need to know
That I've been crazy all my life
Crazy all my life
Well tell me you can help me
I'm nothing but a shell of a man
Baby please the only time I'm right
Is when I am by your side understand?
Can't you see?
Baby it's irrational
Maybe I'm a natural freak
All I know is love can make you stupid
And you are just a song on repeat
Help me
'Cause I don't know if I can take it
I'm so tired of trying to fake it
Tell me you know

Maybe we found we've been crazy all our life
Don't know if I can take it

The place that left me mute
I threw back my shoulders
Factories, Trains and Houses
The place that makes some strong
And hurrys you along
Some grow old very quick there
No star ever played the cellar bar
Glass and bottle fights
We saw some crazy nights
But then fights do excite you
I'm awoken by a
Handbrake turn outside
I knew lads who died
That sound chills me inside still
Howth Junction could take you away
And in the hayfields we'd squander the day
And from the corner of Holywell road
See the sunset over Saint Donaghs
See the sunset over us all
See the sunset over Saint Donaghs
Some boys want to get me
Because I hit one back
I still can here the crack
Of his head on the concrete
Doin drugs and drinking
Makes you so depressed
And then you think you're blessed
When you're dropping a tablet
Troubled years and fighting
Makes you sad you know
And Mammy had to go
Sure it's best in the long run
Howth Junction could take you away
And in the hayfields we'd squander the day
And from the corner of Holywell road
See the sunset over Saint Donaghs
See the sunset over us all
See the sunset over Saint Donaghs
See the sunset over the world<start>it's getting glorious!

Looking In The Rear View Mirror Of My Car
From A Telephone Booth I See You Come
And There You Are With Him
And He Is There With You On Sea Side Avenue
Oh! Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks Monica
Thanks, Thanks, Thanks - Oh, For August Sad Songs
I Put The Tape On, To Cancel The Sound
Of All Rain Hitting On My Hood
Across The Street Upon The Lonely Ground
An Old Umbrella Swings
And I'm Remembering On Sea Side Avenue
Oh! Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks Monica
Thanks, Thanks, Thanks - Oh, For August Sad Songs
Mmm... I Won't Forget You
Mmm... I Won't Forget This Summer
Mmm... The City Called Your Name And You Turned It Into A Diamond
It's All Because Of You... Oh, It's Thanks To You... Oh! Monica
Back On The Bright And Shiny Highway,
Was That Old Squall Really Last Night?
Taking My Sunglasses Out Of My Shirt
You Made My Whole World Blue
And Now I'm Seeing You On Sea Side Avenue
Oh! Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks Monica
Thanks, Thanks, Thanks - Oh, For August Sad Songs
The Wind Was Dry And It Was Sandy
I Spun My Wheels Towards Different Town
The End Is Always The Beginning, My Friend
So Say Goodbye To Me
Good Luck Everybody
Good Bye To Sea Side Avenue
Oh! Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks Monica
Thanks, Thanks, Thanks - Oh, For August Sad Songs

Oh! Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Thanks Monica
Thanks, Thanks, Thanks - Oh, For August Sad Songs<start>Here I go against the grain
It's time to yet again complain
And make some noise
Make some noise
We've got all our sciences
Making our appliances
To dull the pain
It's Novocain for the soul, for the soul
Hollywood, pop culture's best
Do no good, you vultures nest
And I want out
I want out
It's gambling now, the more you wait
And think that you can have your Kate
And Edith, too
And so to lose your own soul, your own soul
I'll call your bluff, I've had enough
Oh no, ho-jo
So is it fantasy or is it reality TV?
So here's your world condoned
You get the chisel, I'll get the stone
Know that with each path we take
We become the choices that we make
It's true and so do you
Forbear to keep obstinate will
And to choose to wait
Until the dream dissolves
And we're absolved from our guilt
From our guilt
I'll call your bluff, I've had enough
I'll call your bluff, I've had enough
I'll call your bluff, I've had enough
I'll call your bluff, I've had enough
Oh no, ho-jo
So is it fantasy or is it reality TV?
So here's your world condoned
You get the chisel, I'll get the stone
So numbed, to fate resigned
And in your grave you'll lie
And in your grave you'll lie
And in your grave you'll lie<start>I make my living off the evening news
Just give me something-something I can use
People love it when you lose,
They love dirty laundry
Well, I coulda been an actor, but I wound up here
I just have to look good, I dont have to be clear
Come and whisper in my ear
Give us dirty laundry
Kick em when theyre up
Kick em when theyre down
Kick em when theyre up
Kick em when theyre down
Kick em when theyre up
Kick em when theyre down
Kick em when theyre up
Kick em all around
We got the bubble-headed-bleach-blonde who
Comes on at five
She can tell you bout the plane crash with a gleam
In her eye
Its interesting when people die-
Give us dirty laundry
Can we film the operation?
Is the head dead yet?
You know, the boys in the newsroom got a
Running bet
Get the widow on the set!
We need dirty laundry
You dont really need to find out whats going on
You dont really want to know just how far its gone
Just leave well enough alone
Eat your dirty laundry
Kick em when theyre up
Kick em when theyre down
Kick em when theyre up
Kick em when theyre down
Kick em when theyre up
Kick em when theyre down
Kick em when theyre stiff
Kick em all around
Dirty little secrets
Dirty little lies
We got our dirty little fingers in everybodys pie
We love to cut you down to size
We love dirty laundry
We can do the innuendo
We can dance and sing
When its said and done we havent told you a thing
We all know that crap is king
Give us dirty laundry!<start>Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We can ride it together,
Making love with each other
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that wont happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together,
Making love with each other,
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other,
From one lover to another<start>Learn to lose, it's easier that way.
We've paid our dues, but we can't make life pay.
All across the world, people going mad,
In their mother's cars, the kids are feeling sad.
That's how it is, and I'll see you later
Everything old is new again, everything under the sun.
Now that I'm back with you again,
We hug and we kiss, we sit and make lists,
We drink and I bandage your wrists.
Wasted youth, there wasn't much to waste.
Down to the bone, and still losing weight.
With all the wishing in the world glistening in her eyes,
But when I say I love her, she thinks I'm telling lies.
Is it all lost? No, we never had it.
Everything old is new again, everything under the sun.
All of our fears come true again.
Recycle, reuse, resent and refuse,
Our parent's ideals and views.
She thinks the afterlife might just be where the action is.
With high schools built like prisons, she can't find a way to live
Moved back home to fill the empty nest.
Afraid to roam, in love with second best.
While somewhere in the world, she's hosting her own show.
Everyone she questions never seems to know,
Just who they are and where they are going
Everything old is new again, everything under the sun.
Now that I'm without you again.
I wake up and eat, I go back to sleep,
And let all my nightmares repeat.
All across the world, people going mad<start>Your pretending fooled us all
Optimistic delusional
Hyperactive and so it shows
Its time to measure the immeasurable
Our indifference grows
From the common evil known
The future's laid out beautiful
Designs suggesting hints to God
I'd like to fathom the unfathomable
And swear to find that certain pressure point
Our indifference grows
From the common evil known
Held down by words<start>I used to get sick with solitude
I was always better in the multitude
But now I like it up here all alone in my ivory tower
Hi-ho at the end of my rope
I watch it all through a telescope
I think I'd have a better chance to see the pope
I get so bored with his shtick and his mini-minute dick
And all his high and mighty shit, I'm a witch
Well, well, well a wish wanna throw it in a ditch
I'm concentrating on the big laugh
You just acting like that damn old Riff-Raff
Shakedown baby
I don't want to have to see
What you got hiding in your body cavity
I'm so sick of your Jersey rap
Your slab rat white as a tic-tac
Why don't you take a dirt nap
You make me laugh and I know who I'm laughing at
Big Jersey hoo-haa
Like your style, like your freedom of speech
Like your dirty thoughts, like your Cream of Wheat
Tuesday is out
Never may be great, level down and read 'em
From the Garden State, this is a Jersey plate
Saturdayin' pretty driving in the city
Your boom is a distortion
Your act is a contortion
The perfume and pretension
Your hair in invention
Ha,Ha,Ha the hive is humming
I thought I heard it all
But there's still more coming
Put it in, put it in, put it in, why don't you put it in
You said your name was what
What kind of a name is that
Shooting past me on the turnpike
Should have told you to take a hike
But there was something
I don't know what
That I guess I kind of like, that nasty attitude
Mediterranean lastitude
I guess you did give me a rush
Yeah you gave me a thrill
Felt so hot and flushed
I even had to take a pill
And your pattern yeah your method yeah
The way you deliver long and slow
The way you get your percussion going
Going strong, and it's my turn to be blowing
Yeah singing my song
You think you know me
Think again
Who's your friend
Who put this freak flag in the mail
Why you sending me this pig tail
You back in Jail
I got your post card saying
How it is in that pen your in
Signed don't forget me, lot's of love from adrenaline
Give it a rest, give it a rest
You got one dimension pure pretension
Cross the river start to shiver
Over to the big smoke, and it's no joke
I told you one more word from you
About Jersey and your dead
Let me lick that uh uh
Can I kiss that, no
Let me kiss that
Let me lick that come on
Let me lick that
Uh huh it might be too sweet
It won't be too sweet<start>They've got us surrounded; we're in their sights
But they're not taking us alive
Hot to the touch, cold on the inside
But they're not taking us alive
They've got us surrounded; we're in their sights
But they're not taking us alive
Hot to the touch, cold on the inside
But they're not taking us alive
If I was still around
Walk me through
I am your savior now
And I'm your secret too
Carry them alive
Fall off the case again
You're just a black widow
Who fell in love with herself
They've got us surrounded; we're in their sights
But they're not taking us alive
Hot to the touch, cold on the inside
But they're not taking us alive
If it's never been broken
Can't believe in it
Now you're just a problem
For someone else to fix
If I was still around
If I'm near you
I am your savior, yeah
I am your secret too
They've got us surrounded; we're in their sights
But they're not taking us alive
Hot to the touch, cold on the inside
But they're not taking us alive
Oh shitty crap shit...<start>A eye pleaser twenty years ago
To this day I still think so
Type two in a door, seat three
And all with the greatest of ease
I couldn't see a damn thing
I couldn't see a damn thing
I couldn't see a damn thing
I couldn't see a damn thing
Engine wise slip through your hand
Speed gear, alone they stand
What kind of plan have you received?
Off we go, you bet, full speed
I couldn't see a damn thing
I couldn't see a damn thing
I couldn't see a damn thing

And send toy soldiers out to help me stand
And when I see you hide behind those curtain folds
I cross the room to turn the lights down low
On common ground we'll build our castle walls
We'll build them stone by stone, and how
With more and more you know it won't take long
Where it burned orange let it burn gold
I wouldn't like to learn a lesson every day
Good times, bad times, it's just a price to pay
But given half a chance at turning back the tide
I'll stay at home and keep my boys in line
On common ground we'll build our castle walls
We'll build them stone by stone, and how
And more and more you know it won't take long
Where it burned orange let it burn gold
And given half the chance to turn the hands of time
I'm always the bridesmade cause
Couldn't live with myself if I tried to be the bride
On common ground we'll build our castle walls
We'll build them stone by stone, and how
With more and more you know it won't take long

Words and sounds that echo in the night
It's like an animal,
It's aboriginal
So unemotional
It's takin over all your senses
Don't be afraid you must obey
The tug of the call of the wild
Deep down you know how to enjoy
Feeling the call of the wild
Open the door of the cage
That's been holding you prisoner
And living a lie
And silence follows your cry
Pungent is the danger in the air
Vibrant notions reach from everywhere
It seems so natural
So very physical
A little virginal
At last you're tearing down all fences
Don't be afraid you must obey
The tug of the call of the wild
Deep down you know how to enjoy
Feeling the call of the wild
Don't hesitate no chance to escape
Follow the call of the wild
It's something that you can't deny
It's ruling all of your senses
Deep down you know how to enjoy
Feeling the call of the wild
Not that you're sharing
The cradle of wisdom
And daring to reach for the skies
A silence follows your cry
It's like an animal,
It's aboriginal
So unemotional
It's takin over all your senses
Don't be afraid you must obey
The tug of the call of the wild
Deep down you know how to enjoy
Feeling the call of the wild
Don't hesitate no chance to escape
Follow the call of the wild
Deep down you know how to enjoy
Feeling the call of the wild
It's something that you can't deny
It's ruling all of your senses<start>FlÃ¡vio Venturini / Tavinho Moura
Penso em vocÃª
No seu jeito de falar
Sua maneira de ser e perguntar
Que Ã© muito natural
Como Ã© natural em vocÃª acontecer
Um desejo de ver a cor da estrada
E desaparecer
Vou seguir os passos e tentar saber
Onde, em que cidade se escondeu vocÃª
Quero sem pensar
O seu jeito de calar
De ouvir aquele resto de canÃ§Ã£o
O que morre pelo are
Que brinca pelo are como coisa natural
Em seu corpo tÃ£o sereno
Acende a velha mania de cantar
Voz do coraÃ§Ã£o deixou oh! oh! oh!
E pergunta sempre onde andarÃ¡
VocÃª
Em meu coraÃ§Ã£o hÃ¡ razÃ£o oh! oh! oh!
NÃ£o esqueÃ§o vocÃª<start>Fall down on my face, I trip toward my retreat
Seeking Your embrace
Blindly I find that I need only You
More, more, more for me, me, me
Bought into their mentality
Eyes opened wide
I'll be transformed by the renewing of my mind over time
Discomfort comes clearly when I lose my gaze
Brought back into righteousness suddenly
Take a dip in the pool of grace
A refreshing touch that lifts my face
Then rest easy in Your arms
Laugh in the face of any harm
Sit and watch the world go by
Wonder at the reason why
And how they can ignore the One
Who gives us life when all is said and done<start>Who can hold the stars
And my weary heart?
Who can see everything?
I've fallen so hard
Sometimes I feel so far
But not beyond your reach
I could climb a mountain
Swim the ocean
Or do anything
But it's when you hold me
That I start unfolding
And all I can say is
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Whatever's in front of me
Help me to sing hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Whatever's in front of me
I'll choose to sing hallelujah
The same sun that
Rises over castles
And welcomes the day
Spills over buildings
Into the streets
Where orphans play
And only you can see the good
In broken things
You took my heart of stone
And you made it home
And set this prisoner free
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Whatever's in front of me
Help me to sing hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Whatever's in front of me
I'll choose to sing hallelujah<start>!

And if feels like forever since I've been close to You
My friends up above me don't understand why I struggle like I do
The shadow's my only, only companion and at night he leaves too
Down in the valley, dying of thirst
Now down in the valley, it seems that I'm at my worst
My consolation is that You baptize this Earth
I'm down in the valley, valleys fill first
Down in this wasteland, I miss the mountaintop view
But it's here in this valley that I'm surrounded by You
Though I'm not here by my will, it's where Your view is the most clear
So I'll stay in this valley if it takes forty years
Down in the valley, dying of thirst
When I'm down in the valley, it seems that I'm at my worst
My consolation is that You baptize this Earth
I'm down in the valley, valleys fill first
It's like that long Saturday between death and the rising day
When no one wrote a word, wondered, is this the end
But You were down there in the well, saving those that fell
Bringing them to the mountain again
Though I'm down in the valley, dying of thirst
When I'm down in the valley, it seems that I'm at my worst
My consolation is that You baptize this Earth
I'm down in the valley, valleys fill first
When You pour on Your water, valleys fill first<start>He said he'd be here at seven
The clock just hit 7:22
It's too cold outside
To wait for my ride
Watching mama try out a new doo (Bruins)
He said he'd be here at seven
But it just hit 7:35 (already?)
Here in Brockton, Mass.,
I got my thumb in my ass
Mama's combing up a big beehive (Celtics)
Where the fuck is he?
Where the fuck is he?
The bitch doesn't even bother calling
Even though it's 7:44 (I fell asleep, pally)
I'm feeling kinda antsy
Mama's getting fancy
Slicking back a wet pompadour (Red Sox)
He said he'd be here at seven
It's closing in on 8:01 (Trimmin' the 'stache, kid)
Me lookin' like a sap
In a wool knit cap
Mama's next move is a bun (fuckin' Patriots)
Where the fuck is he? (My pants are still in the dryer, dude)
Where the fuck is he? (I couldn't find my fuckin' snowboots, pal)
I wish I had a car (Huge, huge hangover)
Oh, no (Massive hailstorm, massive hailstorm, massive)
That stupid little punk
He's probably fuckin' drunk
I bet he drank a case
Wanna pop him in the face right now
Mama's eyebrow
Wicked good
Wicked good (Oh, GOD)
Wicked good
Wicked good (Fuck yeah)
Wicked good
Wicked good (Pisser?)
Well my friend is still a no-show
And I'm getting' fucking pissed (Why?)
'Cause I could've gone with Charlie
In the side of his Harley
Mama's on the phone with a stylist (Fuck Charlie!)
So I guess I ain't going out tonight
'Cause the digits say 12:09 (Shit-faced)
But call the operator
'Cause one perm later
Mama's hair sure do look fine (Heffenreffer!!!)
Where the fuck<start>I don't mean to blow you off
I never even thought to call you
When I saw you yesterday
You said everything was fine
And all this laughing
Means I'm running away
'Cause things we have are fucked
And the things we had are gone
Sometimes it takes so long to wake up
What's the matter with my life anyways?
Friends around me like to talk
I guess they want to know
If I'm gonna get a job
Or if I'm gonna sleep 'til noon
All these people need to keep their mouth shut
'Cause in the end the choice is mine
You never heard me asking you
Don't want to play a part
I'm living in living
So I guess I know
Who my friends really are
All those times it came to stealing
You never let me go that far
And then you told me not to smoke it
But I did
And it took me far away
Yeah, it took me far away<start>Hey, got my hands in my back pocket
I'm a jumpin'
Unscrewing the light from the socket
And I'd rather stand than sit
Puttin' all the people in the dark
Tellin' everyone good night bye bye

Carryin' the truth in my back pocket
My hands are holdin' me down

Fought with my boots till my eyes turned red

Hopin' I've lived on honey and butter

Reverse the wager I've no means to pay
Toto has pulled back the green tonight, in sight
And blue pills coat with such disdain
I wore the shades for so long
That I've forgotten how to see
The curtain rises but who dares to pull the strings
I know this may be hard for you to believe in all
But you only exist because we allow it
I question all the voices in my head
Are they mine or have I been misled?
Total understanding doesn't seem to mean a thing
When you can't see behind the silver screen, a figurine
Can't you hear me scream?
By the way of cosmic rays
A subtle breakdown jarred the code display
A simulation as I can tell, our cell
Playing out a hopeless scene
We stand to lose all our charm
And faith just seems to wane
A billion years can seem a stunningly short time
You've been beaten down time and time again
But still you find yourself at the center of it all
I question all the voices in my head
Are they mine or have I been misled?
Total understanding doesn't seem to mean a thing
When you can't see behind the silver screen, a figurine
Can't you hear me scream?
You hear me, you had one thing to do, one thing
And you fucked it up, piece of shit

And you don't know why
Julie dips her toe in the tide
And she don't know why
No, she don't know why she got
All dolled up for a suicide
And when the stage lights dimmed on the fading scrim,
It was morning before the cheering died
Is it too late to tell you that I don't mind?
King George in imperial robe
And a lazy eye
Knelt down as the semaphore broke
On his tawdry bride
But we don't know why he got
All stressed out on the motherland
With his T.V. sets and his fighter jets
And the royal ubiquitous handycam
Is it too late to tell you that I don't mind?
Here's you with your mom on your back
Going into the woods
She's so proud that you're staying on track
Like a good son should
But you don't know why you got
All choked up when you said goodbye
And you can hear her still when the nights are still
All crying out for calamine
Is it too late to tell you that I don't mind?
Is it too late to tell you that I don't mind?<start>Love was in her heart
But I had dreams to find before I could see
I asked her if she'd wait for me
But I was gone too long
Tears were in her eyes
She said I took our love and threw it away
And nothin' I could do or say
Could bring it back again
I was tryin' to be somethin' more
Than the man I had come to be
I never meant to leave her sad and lonely
If only she could see
I did it all for love
All for love
'Cause nothin' really matters if it's strong enough
All for love
All for love
No, nothin' really matters if you've got enough
She walked out that door
And all my dreams went with her into the night
I wondered how a love so right
Could ever slip away
Love was in her heart
But I had dreams to find before I could see
That somewhere deep inside of me
She'll always be the one
I was tryin' to be somethin' more
Than the man I had come to be
Never meant to leave her sad and lonely
If only she could see
I did it all for love
All for love
'Cause nothin' really matters if it's strong enough
All for love
All for love
No, nothin' really matters if you've got enough
I did it all for love
All for love
'Cause nothin' really matters if it's strong enough
All for love
All for love
No, nothin' really matters but I want her by my side

No, nothin' really matters but I want her<start>Wild as a coastal boranca
Swift as the wind blowin' free
With two eyes like fire brands that glow in the night
Somewhere up there he's waitin' for me
And he knows that I'm coming for him
I just can't rest 'til I find
That raven black stallion who wears no man's brand
With a wild restless spirit like mine
They call him Caballo Diablo
Half horse and half devil they say
Caballo Diablo the outlaw
Of the blanca Sierra Madre
Two men before tried to take him
They had their chance one by one
But each met his fate when those flashin' black hooves
Brought death 'neath the Mexican sun
Still I can't leave, I must find him
You fool of a horse can't you see
I may be half man, but the other half's devil
And you're just exactly like me
They call him Caballo Diablo
Half horse and half devil they say
Caballo Diablo the outlaw
Of the blanca Sierra Madre
Even the breeze has stopped movin'
Hush now, be still
Don't make a sound and stay close to the ground
'Cause he's waitin' just over that hill
Downwind behind him move quickly
Do it fast now, he's startin' to stir
Grab a hand full of mane and up onto his back
And start breaking him down with my spurs
But try as he will, he can't shake me
As over the preface we go
To spill the lifes blood of a horse and a man
On the rocky Sierra below
They call him Caballo Diablo
Half horse and half devil they say
Caballo Diablo the outlaw
Of the blanca Sierra Madre<start>Jangling Jack
Goes Yackety Yack
Visits the home of the brave
Hails a fat yellow cab
Jack wanna celebrate
Jack wanna big drink
Driver drops him at a bar
Called the Rinky Dink
Jack pushes through the door
And crosses the floor
Tips his hat to a man
Grinning in the corner
Going Do da do Do da do
Says, I'm Jangling Jack
I go Do da do
I wanna Rinky Dink Special
I wanna little umbrella too
Jack flops on his stool
Sees the grinning man laugh
So Jack laughs back
Jack raises his glass
Says, God bless this country
And everything in it
The losers and the winners
The good guys and the sinners
The grinning man says, Buddy
It's all Yackety Yack
Whips out a little black pistol
Shoots a bullet in Jack
Jangling Jack
Do Da Do Do Da Do
Jangling Jack
How do you Do Da Do
Jangling Jack Flies off his seat
Crashes through the door
Lands in a heap on the street
Hears his mother's voice
Going, Do do do
Jack is shouting
Mummy is that you?
He sees the berserk city
Sees the dead stacked in piles
Sees the screaming crowd
Screams, Where am I?
Going Do da do Going Do da do
Well Jangling Jack
As a matter of fact
Crawls through the crowd
Back into the bar
Jack crawls to his stool
Jack drags himself up
Falls back down on his arse
In a puddle of blood
Going Goodbye Mummy
Goodbye Goodbye
Jack doubles over
And he vomits and dies
Going Do do do Going Do do do<start>Ritchie was an old friend of mine
He took lots of pills to pass the time
Used to be filled with political conviction
He started to struggle with heroin addiction
[Chorus:]
His skin turned cold and his face turned blue
Not yet 30 but it happened to you
Russian Roulette with a needle in your vein
A junkies life ends up the same
It seems like he changed overnight
He took more dope to feel alright
Didn't pay attention to the warning signs
Started living on borrowed time
[Chorus:]
His skin turned cold and his face turned blue
Not yet 30 but it happened to you
Russian Roulette with a needle in your vein
A junkies life ends up the same<start>I took the train home, facing backwards
Another hopeless chase
Echo Park, Indian summer
I wrote a new song about your new life
Like steps I retrace
Block letters in your little black notebook, yeah
Flashbacks get me close, I'm almost there
Headlights in the driveway
You stand in the window waiting
The stars are out tonight
One million fires burning
Out there on the high dive
You dance with your headphones on
And I could watch you all night long
Dancing to someone else's song
Oh, dancing to someone else's song
Oh, dancing to someone else's
A black jacket, a blue motorbike
Pass the mission in the moonlight
Teenagers in the alley kissing
Smell of gas burn, saw your street sign
I'm doing eighty in a forty-five
Throwing shadows you could hear if you listen, yeah
Flashbacks get me close, I'm almost there
Headlights in the driveway
You stand in the window waiting
The stars are out tonight
One million fires burning
Out there on the high dive
You dance with your headphones on
And I could watch you all night long
Dancing to someone else's song
Oh, dancing to someone else's song
Oh, dancing to someone else's
Flashbacks get me close
But I was staring at someone else's
Headlights in your driveway
You stand in the window waiting
The stars are out tonight
One million fires burning
Meet me on the high dive
You'll dance with your headphones on
So I could watch you all night long
Dancing to someone else's song (song)
Oh, dancing to someone else's song (song)
Oh, dancing to someone else's song

Pushes the pills deep in my eyes

Came out of the dark

Black birds in the day

But in my mind's eye
I have found the reason why
And I carry the burden of the proof
Why do we fight?
Why do we fall?
Why do we stand there backs against the wall?
Why don't we change?
Why don't we try?
Why don't we turn 'round, help the other guy?

a patient heart that refuses to forgive
believing me was the worst thing you ever did
patience is me
its a chance that you took
that you barely denied
this is the end
you just might lose it all<start>I saw you future in her eyes
We searched for love amidst the lies
I didn't mean to draw her in
To a fight we'll never win
And I sigh as.
She becomes like jelly in my hands
She told me things I never heard
And I just drank her every word
We shallow all that love can give
Cause love's the reason that we live
And I cry as.
She becomes like jelly in my hands
We crossed our T's with gazing eyes
We knew it all was finalized
Built this love on sinking sand
And I'm ashamed that I'm afraid to lend a hand as.
She becomes like jelly in my hands.<start>Walk down the river don't stop now keep on walking
Walk down the river 'till you make it to the bright blue sea
This is what she said to me whispered in my ear
A man by the river is a man without fear
One step forward, two steps back keep stepping
Put your foot forward 'cause you're on the right track
Chorus
Walked two days and the ground got hot
by the first turn I could hear gunshots
staggered in the weeds like a fool in the bush
choked in the dirt and a voice said "push"
Lost my way five times in the rain
went three miles for the inches that I gained
kids threw rocks and the cars slowed down
people yelled from the window "fool turn around!"
Chorus
Buildings leaning over trying to break my back
Sky wants to simmer and the Earth wants to crack
let me tell you something, I can hear the sea calling
so I just move it out like a baby crawling
Chorus<start>Every single day
I think about a way that gets me out of here
I wish I could stop thinkin' for a while
Rest my head inside myself and get alright
I can't help it
I don't know where to go
I laid down with you and woke up alone
There's a broken heart
Deep inside of me that's tearin' me apart
Used to being lost in loneliness
There's a part of me that still cannot confess
And I can't help it
I don't know where to go
I laid down with you and woke up alone
Why can't I forget
All the things you did to me, to my regret
There's something that I can't get off my mind
Could it be that you are just one of a kind
And I can't help it
I don't know where to go
I laid down with you and woke up alone
I don't know where to go
I laid down with you and woke up alone
I don't know where to go
I laid down with you and woke up alone
I don't know where to go
I laid down with you and woke up alone<start>A TravÃ©s

I think there might be something wrong with me
I take a deep breath and maybe this dark cloud'll shake me
God, please don't forsake me, I might be crazy
Am I losing my mind?
Sometimes I feel like things are getting worse in time
If I try will You open my eyes?
And make me a part of You, like You're a friend of mine
Next time I'm losing my mind
I'll remember that to find my way out
Is just a waste of time
In place of all my mistakes
You've seen through the shadows above me
No one could ever love me like You
If I finish what I started
Or get swept under the carpet
I'll still be thankful for all You've done
I'll take a note to remind me
But You know where You can find me
I'll probably end up right back here again
Am I losing my mind?
Sometimes I feel like things are getting worse in time
If I try will You open my eyes?
And make me a part of You, like You're a friend of mine
Next time I'm losing my mind
I'll remember that to find my way out
Is just a waste of time
In place of all my mistakes
You've seen through the shadows above me
No one could ever love
I'll be everything that You want me to except for perfect
I'm trying hard just to understand Your plan for me
I'll be everywhere that You want me to, unless I fall
I'm just trying to get my life back again
So, next time I'm losing my mind
I'll remember that to find my way out
Is just a waste of time
In place of all my mistakes
You've seen through the shadows above me
No one could ever love me
Next time I'm losing my mind
I'll remember that to find my way out
Is just a waste of time
In place of all my mistakes
You've seen through the shadows above me
No one could ever love me like You<start>Where does a dream belong
Locked in the mind on the edge of time
Like a ship lost in a storm
How do we find the key
Longing to see, through the artist's eye
Maybe only birds can fly
The man must be insane who knows
A mind alive with images so strange
So close but never rode the sky
Watching the birds as they sail on the wind
Trying to figure out the reason why
Picturing wings held together with string
One day to fly
Someone said and i believe
Try if you dare, you can walk on air
A dream is all you need
A circle that takes you high
Lighter than air as the earth goes by
Through a spiral in the sky
The man must be insane who knows
A mind alive with images so strange
So close but never rode the sky
Watching the birds as they sail on the wind
Trying to figure out the reason why
Picturing wings held together with string
Just a charcoal sketch on canvas
Made them laugh but now they see
That the artist had a vision
That the wind could set us free
It's a bridge until tomarrow
Taking us beyond the sun
As the artist paints his picture
The story's just begun
Analyzing, criticizing
Fear of the unknown
Theorizing, visualizing
The road to take us home
If it takes forever
Someone's gonna fly
We may never get to heaven
But still we're gonna try
Watching the birds
As they sail on the wind
One day to fly<start>Living easy, living free
Season ticket on a one-way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I would rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey Satan, paid my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey mama, look at me
I'm on my way to the promised land, whoo!
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

Just teach me to despise
Will time make man more wise?
Here, within my lonely frame.
My eyes just hurt my brain.
But will it seem the same?
Come tomorrow, will I be older?
Come tomorrow, maybe a soldier?
Come tomorrow, will I be bolder than today?
Now, the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen
When time and tide have been?
Soon, I hope that I will find
Thoughts deep within my mind
That won't disgrace my kind
Come tomorrow, will I be older?
Come tomorrow, maybe a soldier?
Come tomorrow, will I be bolder than today?
Shapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make man more wise?<start>You can need me, if you want to
you can want me, sometimes you're gonna need to
but if you love me, please don't tell me
I'll just open my mouth & foul things up again
I wish I was a dam (instead of a damn fool)
then I'd be able to hold back
& steady the flow of ignorance that trickles from my lips
Remember last time, everything was roses
you heard it through the grapevine
my heart was in the right place
I must admit, it was, so then what was I thinking of
when I opened my mouth & fouled things up again
So you can be with me, and I'd rather you were here with me
or you can feel free to find that shelter somewhere else
but just don't pay no mind, and won't it be a big surprise
when I open my mouth & foul things up again<start>(CHORUS)

You better live your life and try to be so strong

Brother greg
It's been a long long time
Since we maxed it nice
Got fresh
By that seashore line
It was easy
Getting glazed up in the ocean
Time pull pull the tide
Ride waves feel the motion
Then we got parted
Separted like the seas
Felt like I was all alone
In a different country
But now we're back together, man
And never shall we part
Found the link
Got electricity
Here to stand tall
Greg's gonna lay down the law
Greg's gonna lay down the law

Can't you see
That you could be
All that you
Want to be
Won't you just come along
Hear the brothers sing your song

This just might be your last call

She's cheated death more than one time
The tears roll down her face and on to the floor
The psychic's been reading her mind
Women with secrets men with their rage
The lines run deeper than words on the page
Breeze through the window, it turns bitter chill
Pretend we don't feel it, lie here real still
Whispered in visions of new earth shine
We volunteer to do nothing again
The world falls around us all we can do is whine
Living out the future of original sin
Women with secrets men with their rage
The lines run deeper than actors on the stage
Breeze through the mountains turns bitter chill
Pretend we don't feel it, lie here real still
Well now follow me to the water
Dive right through the film
Swim in the madness, fulfill every whim
Why worry about tomorrow that you'll never see
Why talk about the children that will never be
Give us this day our daily bread
Forgive us our monstrosities
No more stories of the Quick and the Dead
The asphalt will burn with our liabilities<start>Der var engang en dreng

Now a young man's gone
But his legend lingers on
For so much had he to give
But his life is through
For the story told is true
For he died just as he lived
For this daring young star
Met his death while in his car
No one knows the reason why
Screaming tire, flashing fire
And gone was this young star
Oh how could they let him die
Still a young man is gone
Yet his legend lingers on
For he died without a cause
And they say that he'll
Be known for evermore
As the 'Rebel Without A Cause'<start>[Whistles]
I just wanna talk about
The way we were when our world stopped turning
Why can't we just laugh about
Mistakes we made, they were good old days?
But I don't care about the lies we told
We'll feel better when we get older
But what would I do if I didn't have you in this delicate game we play?
And is this love an attraction, beautiful distraction
Or are you my great escape?
[Whistles]
Because there's no easy reason
For the cards we fold, when our hands got cold
'Cause I think it's just a feeling
But I've been down this road many times before
Don't let me in, but don't lock the door
What would I do if i didn't have you in this delicate game we play?
And is this love an attraction, beautiful distraction
Or are you my great escape?
'Cause we just need to breathe a little slower
So we can learn to fall a little faster
But I just can't believe
That you're not the one for me
And how was I so naive?
Now what should I do if I don't have you in this delicate game we play?
And is this love an attraction, beautiful distraction
Or are you my great escape?

With windows howling wind into your ear
You listen to the spirits far behind
These things you hear are too much for your mind
The bell strikes and your spine chills like the grave
The chill that turns your blood from red to grey
You know that with these things you see and hear
The silent night has turned to a night of fear
Image on your bedroom wall
Shadows marching in the hall
Just about to flip your mind
Just about to trip your mind
Just about to flip your mind
Just about to trip your mind
The green and purple lights affect your sight
Your mother cannot comfort you tonight
Your brain calls out for help that's never there

She's so fine she's in my mind
I hear her callin'
See the lonely boy, out on the weekend
Trying to make it stay
Can't relate to joy, he tries to speak and
Can't begin to say
She got pictures on the wall
That make me look up
From her big brass bed
Now I'm running down the road trying to stay up
Somewhere in her head
The woman I'm thinking of - she loved me all up
But I'm so down today

I know lots of folks will hate you
and not because they want to
but sometimes they don't even know why.
So don't watch the crowd
Their duty is to be loud
Believe in what you're doing

Cause when you fall along the way
People will have lots to say
They don't even care if you make it through the day

gotta know what you're all about
Be bold and strong
Tell yourself you're not doing wrong
There is no true friend when you're hungry
Not if he is hungry too
At time you can't rely
Because the same brother
Will send you with the offer
Yes feels good and set him right
So don't watch the crowd
Their duty is to be loud
Believe in what you're doing

Yeah! I was living in St. Louis
In the year of nineteen fifty five
Mama didn have no great mansion,
Just a little old country dive.
Papa worked all week long,
Try?to keep us six kids alive.
So I hitch hiked to Chicago
Just to hear Muddy Waters play
I sat and listened to him sing
Until the early hours of day
I asked him what I could do to make it
And it was he who showed me the way
I went back home and wrote a song
And made a record I could claim
The little tune jumped on the charts
And rode me right on up to fame
It netted over ten thousand dollars
And added glory to my name
I was standing at the airport
With my guitar in my hand
And a first class ticket
Destination movie land
I will be in Hollywood, Mama
Before the roosters crow again
When I first started playing music
Over sixteen years ago
Every big town in the country
From St. Francisco to Baltimore
Trying to bring some happy hours
Doing the only thing I know
Can help it, but I love it
Stand here, sing to you
Brings back so many memories
Many things we used to do
ill I see you here again
Take care, good luck to you<start>I need someone's hand to lead me through the night
I need someone's arms that's gonna hold and squeeze me tight
Now, when the night begins, ya know I'm at an end
'Cause I need your love so bad
I need some lips, baby, to feel next to mine
I want someone, baby, to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low and it's time to go
Oh, I need, I need your love so bad
So, give it up, and bring it home to me
Or write it on a paper, baby, so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me and stop drivin' me mad
'Cause I, I need your love so bad
Yes, I need a soft voice, baby, to talk to me at night
And don't you worry, baby, we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea, baby, bring it home to me
I need your love so bad, oh
I need your love, baby, so bad.<start>Une banlieue maudite,
En zone interdite
Une arme de flics
Marqus par la haine,
Les jeunes se dchanent
On a rien perdre
Les bagnoles crment,
La zone est en flammes
Et la folie gagne
Les gamins rebels
Brlent des poubelles
Ce soir c'est la fte!
Petit agit...
Tous des Bruriers
Petit Brurier...
Tous des agits
Viens voir comme il fait chaud,
Les caisses font des tonneaux
C'est le grand rodo
Sous une tte cagoule,
T'a perdu la boule
Et le monde s'croule
La cit des barjots,
Quartier des agits
Commando Brurier
Tu avances masqu
Dans le noir sans papier,
Commando Brurier...<start>I can't tell ya baby what went wrong
I can't make you feel what you felt so long ago
I'll let it show
I can't give you back what's been hurt
Heartaches come and go and all that's left are the words
I can't let go
If we take some time to think it over baby
Take some time, let me know
If you really want to go
Don't know what you got till it's gone
Don't know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I got
It's just this song
And it ain't easy to get back
Takes so long
I can't feel the things that cause you pain
I can't clear my heart of your love it falls like rain
Ain't the same
I hear you calling far away
Tearing through my soul I just can't take another day
Who's to blame
If we take some time to think it over baby
Take some time let me know
If you really want to go
Don't know what you got till it's gone
Don't know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I got
It's just this song
And it ain't easy to get back
Takes so long
Do you want to see me beggin' baby
Can't you give me just one more day
Can't you see my heart's been draggin' lately
I've been lookin' for the words to say
Don't know what you got till it's gone
Don't know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I got
It's just this song
And it ain't easy to get back
Takes so long
Don't know what you got till it's gone no
Don't know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I got
It's just this song
And it ain't easy to get back
Takes so long<start>I think I was better off before this all began
So clearly I can see lately that you don't know who I am
Everybody tried to tell me something that I never could believe
Staring back it seemed so much different than it did in front of me
But I know there's no good in looking back on yesterday
And wondering what could have happened then
You think you can give me what I want
You say
(You say)
You say
I think I'm better off alone
These days
(These days)
These days
Why should I put my trust in something that I never could believe
So one day you can find something better
Just to pack your things and leave
Loneliness is a friend for the moment but you won't walk out on me
But I know there's no good in looking back on yesterday
And wondering what could have happened then
You think you can give me what I want
You say
(You say)
You say
I think I'm better off alone
These days
(These days)
These days
I'm tired and I'm sick of waiting, maybe I'll die alone
'Cause I can't take another damn day of waiting here for you
To come home to me
Yeah, yeah, baby, baby please tell me why
You think you can give me what I want
You say
(You say)
You say
I think I'm better off alone
These days
(These days)
These days
You think you can give me what I want
You say
(You say)
You say
I think I'm better off alone
These days

These days<start>Hey little girl in U.S. dress
Come and give daddy kiss
To Dead Billy, U.S. soldier in green
Little lady, napalm butt
Come and give head to, to
Dead Billy make you boom boom boom
Dead Billy
Dead Billy make you happy
Dead Billy make you crawl
Dead Billy put your hand in his hole
Dead Billy show you what it's like to die
This is not a love song
And this is not a kiss
For Dead Billy
Dead Billy make you happy
Dead Billy make you crawl
Dead Billy put your hand in his hole
Dead Billy show you what it's like to die
This is not a love song
And this is not a kiss
For Dead Billy
No Viet??<start>If you could burn it out
Like a tick buried in your hide
If you could tear it out
Like a thorn stuck in your side
Then you can bet that I
Don't want to look at what you find
'Cause I'm afraid that I
Might want to keep it for myself
I thought I was above you
I hate that I love you
And I thought I was above you
I hate that I love you
If you could tell a lie
Sharp enough to get through my skin
If you could sell a lie
To make me want to come back again
Then you can bet that I
Want to feel it dribble down my chin
Sometimes I think I'd give everything away
To let that animal in
And I thought I was above you
I hate that I love you
And I thought I was above you
I hate that I love you
And I thought I was above you
I hate that I love you
And I thought I was above you
I hate that I love you<start>Been caught by my doubt
Been caught by desire
Been caught by the love that I am feeling for you
I wanted to shout, I wanted the fire
I wanted to fight my shadows so blue
When she left me hanging in vane
I was totally going insane
But still I know, I know
You better believe it - it's true
You better believe it - it's you
You better believe it - 'cause you're the one for me
You better believe it - some how
You better believe it - right now
You better believe it - and this time you'll be mine
Be mine
Keep hoping for change
Keep hoping for mercy
Keep hoping my love will come back someday
And the next time I want her to know
That my feelings continue to grow
So let me show, just show
You better believe it - it's true
You better believe it - it's you
You better believe it - 'cause you're the one for me
You better believe it - some how
You better believe it - right now
You better believe it - and this time you'll be mine
Be mine
I won't even know if she'll - ever change her mind
I won't even know if she'll - come back to find
Now that I'll give my life - just for one single day
Here with her
By my side
You better believe it - it's true
You better believe it - it's you
You better believe it - 'cause you're the one for me
You better believe it - some how
You better believe it - right now
You better believe it - and this time you'll be mine
Be mine<start>I've got a new dress
With large breasts
And I look funny
My beautiful boy
Who has brown eye
We both smell immensely
We live in our dreams
He lives with self
Will open up
And now he bashes his head
Again and again
Oh my bed
Oh my knees
He's an odd boy
Lucky boy
Makes big noise
With big bottle
Lovely ugly cruel world (repeat)
I wear a nice blue hat
Just to keep in with awing of things
Ugly, and it head to.......<start>I wanna hear your sad sad voice
Come to me loud and clear
I wanna hear your lips and tongue
Form the words no ears should hear
Wanna watch you
While your face reddens with fear
Watch your eyes
Get all clouded up with tears
This thing is such a stupid mess
So nuts you never would have guessed
You better watch yourself
Your words just tell
Watchin' your sundress
Just blowin' in the breeze
This time of year I want
To breathe but I just sneeze
And the sunshine is just
Killing me by degrees
I go to smell the roses
Just to get stung by the bees
Your words just free me day by day
You better watch the things you say
Button your lip
Your tongue just slip
I don't need to read
About myself in other towns
I don't want to hear all you have seen
Or what you've found
And when you turn
For the second go around
Just keep your mouth shut
And your ear down to the ground
Your words just free me day by day
You better watch the things you say
Button your lip
Your tongue just slip<start>Has anybody here seen my old friend Abraham,
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lotta people, but it seems the good die young
But I just looked around and he's gone.
Has anybody here seen my old friend John,
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lotta people, but it seems the good die young
But I just looked around and he's gone.
Has anybody here seen my old friend Martin,
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lotta people, but it seems the good die young
But I just looked around and he's gone.
Didn't you love the things they stood for?
Didn't they try to find some good for you and me?
And we'll be free,
Someday soon it's gonna be one day.
Has anybody here seen my old friend Bobby,
Can you tell me where he's gone?
I thought I saw him walkin' up over the hill
With Abraham, Martin and John.<start>When I was a small boy here in London town
Seasons snow was falling on the ground
All the friends and family here on Christmas eve
Gather around to dress the Christmas tree
But daddy's down at the pub
Full of Christmas cheer
Probably won't come home
Until next year
Oh the Christmas bells are ringing
And the carolers are singing
Mom, daddy, he don't hear 'em
He's yellin' at the Christmas tree
Santa's balls are jingling
Mommy's hips a-wiggling
But daddy, he don't hear 'em
He's yellin', he's yellin' at the Christmas tree
All right now, yeah
Uncle is a sports fan, granny likes a joke
But no one laughs when daddy's stumbles home
But he don't fall asleep, the night was getting black
You see, oh God dad had too much jack, oh Lord
Every year is the same old thing
Like Rudolph's red nose
Telling this story will never get old
Oh the Christmas bells are ringing
And the carolers are singing
But daddy, he don't hear 'em
He's yellin' at the Christmas tree
Santa's balls are jingling
Mommy's hips a-wiggling
But daddy, he don't hear 'em
He's yellin', he's yellin' at the Christmas tree
Well alright now, yeah, well alright now
Yellin' at the Christmas tree
Santa came down the chimney but then he ran upstairs
Jumped in bed with mommy, she didn't care
Across the room went the fruitcakes the wreath came off the door
If these are holidays I can take no more
Every year it's the same old thing
Like Rudolph's red nose
Hearing this story will never get old
Oh the Christmas bells are ringing
And the carolers are singing
But daddy, he don't hear 'em
He's yellin' at the Christmas tree
Santa's balls are jingling
Mommy's hips a-wiggling
But daddy, he don't hear 'em
He's yellin' at the Christmas tree
Santa's balls are jingling
Mommy's hips a-wiggling
But daddy, he don't hear 'em
He's yellin', he's yellin' at the Christmas tree
All right now, yeah
Yellin' at the Christmas tree
He's yellin' at the Christmas tree
He's yellin' at the Christmas tree
He's sleeping it the Christmas tree<start>When they look around and they will look around
They'll be without the kind of things we lex about
Do with background inventions for one last glimpse to the real
When dell was astounded deepest densten sound joys to be around
Commendable tones a commanding role
For the crowd we bow and are bowed to
Begging and borrowing
Burrowing and bringing us our swillen
And come to think of it you're like a Christmas dinner of compost heap
For ready to reap but it won't keep there's hose it's all show
You need it higher my sin
Then I hope you win the lottery no Tom-foolery
It's a genuine wish I long for fairground attractions
For one last go at the wheel
Blow
Blow
Blow
Blow
And begging and borrowing
Burrowing and bringing us our swillen
And trying for trying is frightening
I packed for an outing an endless task though anything bold
Blow
Blow
Blow
Blow<start>I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?
I've been put down
I've been pushed 'round
When will I be loved?
When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time
I've been made blue
I've been lied to
When will I be loved?
When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time
Oh, I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?
When will I be loved?
Tell me, when will I be loved?<start>Out I started, late tonight
Blinded by the light
Strangest feelin' I have known
Don't know what's wrong or right
See the people, clubs and bars
Streetlife passin' by, yeah
Screamin' engine, burnin' gas
I'm on overdrive
Danger, danger, save your soul
The finger's writin' on the wall
Where you are the angels are blind
Midnight and I cruise along the highway
Midnight and I'm all right on the highway
Midnight sky is bright and clear
New moon on the right
All at once, risin' haze
The freeway is my life
I'm on a high, spacin' out
Where I'm goin' I don't care
Can't you see, this is me
I'm an indestructible boy
Danger, danger, save your soul
The finger's writin' on the wall
Where you are the angels are blind
Midnight and I cruise along the highway
Midnight and I'm all right on the highway
I'm all right
Midnight and I cruise along the highway
Midnight and I'm all right on the highway
Midnight and I cruise along the highway
Midnight, on a never ending highway<start>Shawty you the one I give my air to.
Think they can turn the music up if they care to.
All I might hear, is shawty right here.
Her ass make room even in a tight pair.
And the truth is, I'm on top like a roof is.
Shawty try n to get where my bloothooth is.
But I get cocky on them though, and when they halla I get foxy on a hoe.
Yeah that mean I go deaf, my game so official it don't need no reff.
If you stop winnin', I stop winnin', like I'm in the club, and the DJ stop spinnin'.
Baby I can turn you on, while them other nigga's try n to learn the song
Its Loso, in case you didn't know so, can't hear haters 'cause they talk low so.
Unlike anything that I've ever seen
Like a face that been cut out a magazine,
And a body like a goddess
Got these dudes truing there hardest,
But it ain't workin', oh oh,
I just sit back and observe the way you move,
Something 'bout you make me wanna get to you, and then the lights go dim (yeah)
And then I get this feeling, oh
[Chorus]
I can't hear the music (cause I'm focused on you)
I can't hear the music (wen I'm dance with you)
I can't hear the music (feels like it just me and you, in here, nobody can hear)
I can't hear the music (cause I'm focused on you)
I can't hear the music (wen I'm dance with you)
I can't hear the music (feels like it just me and you, in here, nobody can hear)
Unlike anything that I've ever felt before,
When we laid eyes, I could see that there was something more,
She was sexy and so innocent, guilty and magnificent,
I knew that I had to have that girl,
There was a silence that felt upon the club,
On comes the spotlight and all I could see was her,
We started moving to a heart beat,
You became a part of me (a part of me)
'cause
[Chorus]
Your so beautiful, like an angel on the dance floor
All eyes are on you girl,
Impossible to make one,
Since I laid eyes on you,
I hope that I'm gon leave with you,
Your what I'm wishin' for,
'cause
I can't hear the music (cause I'm focused on you)
I can't hear the music (wen I'm dance with you)
I can't hear the music (feels like it just me and you, in here, nobody can hear)
No, I can't (cause I'm focused on you)
Focused on you (wen I'm dance with you)
Dancing with you (feels like it just me and you, in here, nobody can hear)
I can't hear the music,
I can't hear the music,
I can't hear the music,
I can't hear the music
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa<start>Let me put my arms
Around your head
Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed
Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh babe, it'll be alright
Pour me out another phone
I'll ring and see
If your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone
And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jagger's eyes
And scored
Like the video films we saw
[Chorus:]
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a Drive-in Saturday
Jung the foreman prayed at work
That neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation
Amid this fall out saturation
Cursing at the Astronette 8
Who stands in steel
By his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The Bureau Supply
For ageing men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Which once had raised a sea
That raged no more
Like the video films we saw
[Chorus]
It's a Drive-in Saturday [repeat]<start>I see the scars from a mad man's knife
Marks on your wrist where he had you tied
You try and tell me it doesn't mean a thing
I hear the sad songs you're left to sing
You thought you could take it, day after day
You're blessed to be able to still walk away
Your mother told you they were dirty old men
They say if you don't play you can't win
You want love, you need love
There's love on the mountain
His hands were folded as if to pray
But he never had any words to say
He walked beside you then and he left you alone
To face the fear that he places in your soul
Prodigal girl, come in out of the cold
Rest your feet before you explode
Prodigal girl, I know you're hurt
I know what they stole<start>I dreamed I saw St. Augustine
Alive as you or me
Tearing through these quarters
In the utmost misery
With a blanket underneath his arm
And a coat of solid gold
Searching for the very souls
Whom already have been sold
Arise, arise, he cried so loud
In a voice without restraint
Come out, ye gifted kings and queens
And hear my sad complaint
No martyr is among ye now
Whom you can call your own
So go on your way accordingly
But know you're not alone
I dreamed I saw St. Augustine
Alive with fiery breath
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones
That put him out to death
Oh, I awoke in anger
So alone and terrified
I put my fingers against the glass
And bowed my head and cried<start>I'm so close to being so far away from You
I was wrong but it takes so much to say it to You
Like a broken husband and wife
Who never talk but share their nights
I'm so close to being so far away from You
I have nothing when I'm living apart from You
Outside, creation groans
To lose our darkness and be made whole
For my feet are close to slipping
Speak to my heart in time
You have promised, so I do believe
You won't forget this wandering child
Still I'm so close to being so far away from You
Though I know no one on their own makes it through
My soul clings to the dust
So in Your life, let it be enough
For my feet are close to slipping
Speak to my heart in time
You have promised, so I do believe
You won't forget this wandering child
I'm so foolish to believe that
I can escape Your love, Your love
I'm so foolish to believe that
I can escape Your love
For my feet were close to slipping
You spoke to my heart in time
And You have promised, so I do believe
You won't forget this wandering child
You're so close when I feel far away from You
You're so close when I feel far away from You<start>Wann auch immer wir vereinbart haben,
mein Leben kam zu spt.
Immer wenn es wichtig war,
lie es mich im Stich.
Es war stndig nur auf Parties,
ich sa allein zu Haus.
Ganz egal, was es auch zu feiern gab,
mein Leben das ging aus.
Mein Leben war eine Schlampe,
es lie sich dauernd gehen,
stand stundenlang vorm Spiegel
und fand sich dabei schn.
Es blieb oft bis mittags liegen,
kam meistens gar nicht aus dem Bett,
schlief endlos seinen Rausch aus,
jetzt ist es aufgequollen und fett.
Gebt mir ein neues Leben!
Ihr bekommt mein altes gern umsonst zurck.
Ich brauche keinen Garantieschein
und ich will kein Umtauschrecht.
Gebt mir einfach nur ein anderes,
ich kann mein altes nicht mehr sehen.
Gebt mir ein neues Leben!
Nehmt mein altes jetzt sofort von mir zurck!
Vor Jahren waren wir mal glcklich,
damals haben wir noch gepat.
Schworen uns die Treue fr ewig
und glaubten beide dran.
Doch mein Leben wollte irgendwann mehr,
als ich jemals geben kann.
Und es hat sich selbst zerstrt,
weil's mit der Wahrheit nie klar kam.<start>(INSTRUMENTAL)<start>Wanting you beside myself
Cause I feel like this for no body else
I used to wonder what its like inside your mind
I thought I was over this
When did I notice July
It hits you and eats you from inside
But remembering you won't care
But it will give me peace of mind to say I'm sorry
I feel like this another way
Found myself pray for your better days
I used to wonder what its like inside your mind
I thought I was over this
When did I notice July
It hits you and eats you from inside
But remembering you won't car
But it will give me peace of mind to say sorry
Wanting you beside myself
I feel like this for nobody right yes
To understand and shine your light
Deep down I thought I was right
Until I
So I feel like I'm a day away
With destiny calling me strong
To understand and shine your light
Deep down I thought I was right
Until I
Noticed July
It hits you and eats you from inside
But remembering you won't car
But it will give me peace of mind to say sorry
Until I Noticed July
I noticed
But remembering you won't car
But it will give me peace of mind so I'm sorry<start>I remember the month, remember the day
Remember you took my breath away
You holding my hand, you opened the door
Gently you pulled me to the floor
We were flawless, pure as the snow
Deep as the river of time that flows
And I, I need to know
How did a dream come to an end
How did I lose my lover, my friend
Couldn't we fall backwards in time
Back to the moment you became mine
Oh it's so hard to walk away
When you've had perfect for one day
I remember the place, remember the time
Remember how you made my world shine - oh
Why, why did you lie, why did you cheat
You made my life feel incomplete
We were flawless, pure as the snow
You tore me apart and you hurt me so
Now why I have to know
How did a dream come to an end
How did I lose my lover, my friend
Couldn't we fall backwards in time
Back to the moment you became mine
Oh it's so hard to walk away
When you've had perfect for one day
Why am I still here, why do I not leave
How can I stay, when I can hardly breathe
Frozen here in space, distant as a star
You are near but yet so far
Oh it's so hard to walk away
When you've known perfect for one day
How did a dream come to an end
How did I lose my lover, my friend
Couldn't we fall backwards in time
Back to the moment you became mine
Oh it's so hard to walk away
When you've had perfect for one day
When you've had perfect for one day
Yeah, we were perfect for one day<start>Ease your trouble
We'll pay them double
Not to look at you for a while
And you rely on
What you get high on
And you last just as long as it serves you
Explode or implode
Explode or implode
We will take care of it
Yes we will carry you
Cause you're deserted
What's good you hurt it
And kills you it keeps you alive
So give it up
In a world of puppets
It's a shame what they do to us all
Can we do anything for you now ?<start>The other night dear as I laid sleeping I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke dear I was mistaken and I hung my head and cry
You are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when skies're grey
You'll never know dear how much I love you please don't take my sunshine away
[ steel ]
You told me once dear you really loved me and no one else could come between
But now you've left me and you love another you have shatered all my dreams
You are my sunshine...<start>I bless the day I found you
I want my arms around you
And so I beg you
Let it be me
Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever
Let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love
What would life be?
So never leave me lonely
Tell me that you love me only
And say you'll always
Let it be me<start>Wendel brought it to life in his guest room bath tub
It was a special project for his 4-H club
But it broke loose out in the middle of the night
And now it's eatin' flower children left and right
All the punks are gonna scream, yippee
'Cause it's the thing that only eats hippies
First it cruised on out to Malibu
And ate a couple a' surfers who where too tough to chew
So it slithered it's way out to old Irvine
And ate a couple a' hippies and they tasted just fine
Now, its got a sweet tooth for long hair
So, Bob and Greg and Grant you should beware
Followin' the dead is how it gets it's kicks
Shame it wasn't born in 1966
Listens to the music and begins to sway
Dreamin' acid dreams of a hippie souffle
Hey hey hey
What do they taste like, some kind a' treat?
How many hippies can this monster eat?
It ate stills and Nash before they could shout
And then it chewed on David Crosby but it spit him out
All the punks are gonna scream, yippee
'Cause it's the thing that only eats hippies
There it goes
Gonna send 'em all to that big folk festival in the sky
So long suckers<start>Why do I feel so outside, looking in bruised and broken
Battle scars I get knocked down
Lick my wounds get up and stand in the line
[Chorus]
We're all standing in a line, and it's never enough time
When your two steps behind, you're always two steps behind
Cynical world with no commercials
Breading disguise of flamboyant lies
Factory built with no guarantee
Don't want to buy this don't want to stand in their line
[Chorus]
[Repeat: x2]
Don't want to, stand in your, don't want to stand in your line
[Repeat: x4]
This is the story of my life<start>[Instrumental]<start>I told you once, I told you twice
You never listen to my advice
Good kind treatment, I'm threw with you
Won't get to heaven, I don't care what you do
I seen you changing from day to day
Nothing never gets in your way
Don't feel nothing for no one else
Take what you want, just help yo self

Now you want a Revolution
(Want a revolution)
A revolution now
(Say you wanna, say you wanna)
Say you wanna a revolution

(Ya never listen) To my advice
(Now your out there) Your on your own
Ain't got no friends, ain't got no home

Just don't like the way you do
Don't know where you think you been
But your going to wind up back there again

You wanna a revolution

For you to see where you come from
(You can't go back) Can't go back, can't stay the same
No one but yourself to blame
(Say you wanna, say you wanna)
Now you want a Revolution
(Want a revolution)
A revolution now
(Say you wanna, say you wanna)
You wanna a revolution
(Wanna revolution)
A revolution now
(Say you wanna, say you wanna)
Do you wanna revolution now?
(Revolution, a Revolution now)<start>You always had what you wanted
So leave it behind
And if the glass isn't broken
Then the future's not blind
All that you know
Means nothing to you
But it's the loss of control
Shatters the truth
'Cos the story so far is already here
We've made it this far
Through the battered experience
Though life cuts to pieces
'Til the wounds of no secrets
Makes it all who you are
Love craves self destruction
It's a blizzard in hand
You lay your cards on the table
But you're not in command
So burn with the fire
You so eagerly lit
Watch the flames flicker higher
Say, I don't care about me
'Cause the story so far is already here
We've made it this far
Through the battered experience
Though life cuts to pieces
'Til the wounds of no secrets
Makes it all who you are
Makes it all who you are
Makes it all who you are
Makes it all who you are
No, it's bitter, the pill
That you swallow to feel
I don't care what I lost
I just thank God I'm alive
Makes it all who you are
Makes it all who you are
Makes it all who you are
Makes it all who you are
Makes it all who you are
That's the story so far<start>Give me a break from your taking your take
Come on and give me a break, what do you want from me?
Feeding the rich with that son of a bitch
Well that son of a bitch he looks just like me
Thanks for nothing absolutely nothing
Thanks for all your bull shit too
Thanks for nothing positively nothing
Thanks for everything you didn't do, thanks
Something for free you've got something from me
You want something for free, what do you want from me?
Give me a break with your taking your take
Come on and give me a break, what do you want from me?
Thanks, thanks for nothing absolutely nothing
Thanks for all your bull shit too
Thanks for nothing positively nothing
Thanks for everything you didn't do, thanks
Give me a break from your taking your take
Come on and give me a break, what do you want from me?
Give me a break, come on and give me a break
Come on and give me a break, what do you want from me?

Thanks, thanks<start>St. Teresa
I heard you're coming to town
Your little footsteps
Make the sweetest sound
They come to put me down
Come to put me down down down
Mother is it ok if I call you mama?
My own walked away when I broke the law
And standing on the bridge
Feeling like falling
Would you pray for me mama?
St. Teresa
Have mercy on my soul
The good must die young
That's why I'm getting so old
They come to put me down
They come to put me down down down
Mother is it ok if I call you mama?
My own walked away when I broke the law
And standing on the bridge feeling like falling
Would you pray for me mama?
I was never good at confession
Never really that good at anything at all
And they don't want me hanging around the mission
Singing hallelujah
Singing hallelujah
St. Teresa
Could I kiss your skin?
Come a little closer
To this hell I'm living in
When they put me down
When they put me down
Mother is it ok if I call you mama?
My own walked away when I broke the law
And standing on the bridge
Feeling like falling
Would you pray for me mama?
Would you pray for me mama?
Would you stay with me mama?
And keep singing hallelujah
Mama<start>Angels fall to the floor
Like they would if I was captain
"Silver children," She roared
"I'm not the son of God"
Somebody help me sing
Can anybody hear me?
Liars and lovers combine tonight
We're gonna make a scene
Somebody help me sing
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Somebody help me sing
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Help me be captain of
Our crippled disguises
I won't show what's underneath
It's time for surprises
I can't climb up your ladder
I can't ride your horse
I've swallowed half an hourglass
So now the landscape is swollen up
I gave birth to a fire
It's like his features where burning
I'm in control
I am the son of God
Somebody help me sing
Can anybody hear me?
Line up your soldiers one final time
We're gonna have a ball
Somebody help me sing
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Somebody help me sing
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Help me be captain of
Our crippled disguises
I won't show what's underneath
It's time for surprises
I can't climb up your ladder
I can't ride your horse
I've swallowed half an hourglass
So now the landscape is swollen up
Let's love death away
Let's love death away
Let's love death away
Let's love death away
Let's love death away
Let's love death away
Let's love death away
Let's love death away<start>"Well, good for you.
But we have something too."
So said my aunt.
A bowling alley and lunch counter
Filled with fellas on their lunch break,
From the Western Electric plant at a slant across the street.
And next door when So-and-So's men would come in, and the man himself very often.
It was guns under the counter every time.
Guns under the counter every time.
Guns under the counter every time,
And bowling on the second floor.
Very often he was there himself,
And I, of course, had a special small ball as a little girl,
And didn't I grow up, didn't I grow up to be captain of the Morton girls bowling team?
I did!
Though I don't attach much importance to that now, or then,
Then riding the old Garfield El downtown,
And on up to State Street,
And back to guns under the counter,
Guns under the counter every time.
Guns under the counter,
And bowling on the second floor.
I never liked Douglas park,
And no one likes it now,
But that's neither here nor there. (There, or here.)
West of Crawford, where it is I stayed,
Chicago straights alliterates. (North, and south.)
I lived in the Ms.
But it was down on the south side,
Dr. Peter Pane and his brother had their doughnut factory.
And I mention it now because...
That one day (Now I wasn't there, We were in Davenport at that time),
Some north side Irish bullets came zipping through that window.
In Cicero,
Never stand at a window!
And past the counter,
Looking for those men,
Who had their guns behind the counter,
And you could smell the boiled cabbage on those bullets!
One of them managed to hit a young pinsetter in the leg;
Wouldn't you know it.
But luckily Panagoulis
Dr. Peter Pane
Was there to see to it.
He took some special blackberry filling right out of his lunch bag
And applied it to the young man's wound.
You see, Dr. Peter Pane was an interesting man,
And an even more interesting doctor,
As he would use no material or remedy
That wasn't used in the manufacture of his doughnuts,
Down on 82nd and Kedzie with his brother.
But he tempered this by the fact that he would rarely use ingredients that didn't have some medicinal purpose.
Or so he thought.
Here in the doughnut factory,
They have confectioner's sugar
So sweet it was caustic.
And chocolate so bitter that it could kill typhus!
Glazing so shiny,
It could set back glaucoma.
And filling so filling,
You didn't need stitches!
The same special blackberry filling that was applied to the young man's wound.
Blackberry filling that came straight from Dr. Peter Pane's lunch bag.
We were in Davenport,
With a big restaurant downtown,
And I once kept a jackrabbit in the back yard,
And I'd walk across the river to Rock Island,
To Greek school,
On a fine fall day.
And I'd look up at the sky
And down at the river.
But Davenport changed its name to Hooverville,
So to speak,
And we had to go to Chicago to move in with my aunt.<start>Manchmal kommt sie hier vorbei,
aber stehen bleib sie nie.
Manchmal nehme ich mir frei
und dann wart ich hier auf sie.
Auf sie.
Das schne Mdchen.
Ab und zu ist das Wetter schn
und dann lchelt sie sogar.
Ich hab sie schon so oft gesehn,
doch sie nimmt mich gar nicht wahr.
Nicht wahr.
Das schne Mdchen.
Wenn der erste Sonnenschein
auf ihre Haare fllt,
dann gb ich alles in der Welt,
um ein Sonnenstrahl zu sein.
Einmal.
Ich werde weiter auf sie warten,
vielleicht sprech ich sie ja mal an.
Ich wrd ihr gern so viel erzhlen.
Erzhlen
und sie wird zuhr'n,irgendwann
irgendwann.
Das schne Mdchen.<start>Ain't nobody, gonna do my baby wrong.
Ain't nobody, gonna do my baby wrong.
Lord, I still love that woman
Even though I know she's gone, long gone.
Lord, I know she's out walkin',
Walkin' up and down the street.
Well I know my baby's out walkin'
Walkin' up and down the street.
Lord she's got a brand new story
For each and every man she meets.
Blind love, blind love,
It oughta be a crime,
For lovin' you the way I do.
My best friend knows all about it,
He don't have a thing to say.
Lord he knows all about it,
He just don't have a thing to say.
Oh, it hurts me so bad, to see you treat me this way.
Well I see my baby walkin',
Now I don't even raise my hand.
When I see my baby walkin',
I don't even raise my hand,
Oh it hurts me in my heart,
To see you with another man.
Blind love, blind love,
It oughta be a crime,
For lovin' you the way I do.
Blind love, blind love,
It oughta be a crime,
For lovin' you the way I do.
Blind love, blind love,

She lived in a cabbage world
Along came annie she pinched her fanny

Alone and so afraid
Along came tweety and there he stayed
Eating fish bones from the old fish tray
Billy lived happily ever after
Every single day
Billy and tweety
Love to be silly

Love to be silly
Billy billy billy so silly
Billy and tweety<start>Lying there beside you in the dark, I could not see
Past the light you had set there for me
Oh, that night had it's meaning and the flame shook your room
From the walls to the beating of my heart
But now you're gone
And I won't worry any more
Yes, now you're gone
And I won't worry any more
Oh, your sighs screamed with loneliness
Your eyes traced broken dreams
And your touch held a warning of goodbye
Oh, many's the times I've reached for you
More's the times I've failed
I'm the reason, I'm the cause of it all
But now you're gone
And I won't worry any more
Now you're gone
And I won't worry any more
Why you begged me?
Must we stay here but to wait a bitter end
Than the silence this dimming light foretells
Why the future? Why the past?
Why this moments cold retreat?
How do I know there's no relief you can bring?
And I was lost, I could not answer
No, I could not shed a tear
To the ghost of a love that could have been
Well, I see them all just coming
And I know that they're all gone
But as you're near I won't worry any more
And now you're gone
And I worry anymore
Yes, you're gone
And I won't worry any more<start>(Alexander/Badlees)
(Chorus)
There must be angels of mercy
Lookin' down on me
'Cause when I look up to the sky
I swear I see
Angels of mercy lookin' down on me
Well, I know what I know
And you know what you know too
And I know that you know
Exactly what I think of you
And if I were you and you were me
I wouldn't blame you for not liking me
Even though we aren't enemies
(Chorus)
Time can have a way of changin'
Everything you think is right
And time can have a way of takin'
Everything you hold too tight
So you search for explanations
And you find some now and then
While the angels
They're gettin' impatient
With your experiments
(Chorus)
I believe there's a power of healing
That comes with experience
I believe in believing your feelings
Even when they make no sense
But I believe that the way I'm going
I'm gonna end up too soon dead
Well, when asked to give my reasons
This is what I said
I might have used my education
If I gave a shit
I might have spoke for my generation
If I agreed with it
Now some say that I've gone crazy
But I ain't gone nowhere
Some say I'm apathetic man,
But I don't care
I admit that I'm a loser
I admit that I am scum
I admit I like cheap beer and women
As much as anyone
I don't worry about the future
Who knows what that will bring
I just wait and see what happens
And pretend I planned the whole thing
So let's see what tomorrow brings
(Chorus 2x)<start>In my eyes, indisposed
In disguise as no one knows
Hides the face, lies the snake
The sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat, summer stench
'Neath the black the sky looks dead
Call my name through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come
Stuttering, cold and damp
Steal the warm wind tired friend
Times are gone for honest men
And sometimes far too long for snakes
In my shoes, a walking sleep
And my youth I pray to keep
Heaven send Hell away
No one sings like you anymore
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come
Hang my head, drown my fear
Till you all just disappear
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come<start>Now that you're gone, I can see what
Was going on and how you lied
When you'd said you'd never love again
Friends telephone and they say
You weren't out alone last night
Can't you see that this broken heart
Is killing me
Another night is falling
And now my heart is calling you back to me
[Chorus:]
Come back cause I need your love
Come back got to have your love
Come back bring your loving back to me
Come back cause it's been so long
Come back, and my love's still strong
Come back bring your loving back to me
You play with words play with love
It's just your silly way
I'm a fool cause I need you by my side again
Now it's too late you walk by
With another man
And I stand alone
Cause I know that you're not coming home
Another night is falling
And now my heart is calling you back to me
[Chorus]
Another night is falling
And now my heart is calling you back to me
[Chorus]<start>Every day I wake up we drink a lot of coffee and watch the CNN
Every day I wake up to a bowl of clover honey and let the locusts fly in.
Lobsterbacks attack the town again
Wrap all my things in aluminum
Beams of darkness streak across the sky
Pink rays from the ancient satellite
Every time I look out my window same three dogs looking back at me.
Every time I open my windows cranes fly in to terrorize me.
The power of the Holy Ghost
The power of the Holy Ghost
Shadow of the New Praetorian
Tipping cows in fields Elysian
Saturnalia for all you have
The seven habits of the highly infected calve
Swan diving off the tongues of crippled giants
International Business Machine
Choking on bits of barley bread crumbs
Oh this burning beard I have come undone.
It's just as I've feared. I have, I have come undone.
Bugger dumb the last of academe.
Okkam's razor makes the cutting clean.
Shaven like a banker, lilac vegetal.
Break the glass ceiling and golden parachute on down.
The power of the Holy Ghost comes to town.
Shadow of the New Praetorian
Tipping cows in fields Elysian
Saturnalia for all you have
The seven habits of the highly infected calve.<start>I wasn't expecting this
Now everything is destroyed
Underneath us are the nothings
Underneath them is a void
Beyond that void is a place
Where figments from bad dreams are banished
Childhood nightmares all come seeking
And adult lo
gic nearly vanished
Chaos
None of this is what I wanted
I truly asked for what I got
Bang the gavel, it's lawlessness
I can't unravel the knot
Half this wretched town is starving
While the other half are bloated
Everybody hates the bastards in p
ower
But their pill is sugar coated
I didn't need any of this
I feel anxiety in my neck
The consequences now apparent
Feeding back unchecked
Incessant blue in spiral coils
Fingers underneath the skin
Adrenaline is not my mistress
But she always k
knows just where I've been<start>The people I know have heard so many things
But things just ain't the same no more
Can't decide if I should do the same
So when you left we all asked why
I tried to see the lighter side
Of what we're doing with our lives today
It's not the time to grow up anyway
Time to grow up
I never thought that you would be the first
The words could never be reversed
Got your job and now you're on your way<start>I can no longer watch TV
Cause that shit really melts my brain
I think I'm what they call sensitive
And easily thrown off my game
All that bloodshed and pettiness
Just makes the world seem so insane
And I just feel drained
When I go to do my food shopping
And all I can see is the packaging
One big mountain of garbage
About to be happening
And I walk past my own self-loathing
Like I walk past animals in the zoo
Trying not to really see them
And the prison they didn't choose
If I should ever quit your spotlight
I hope you won't think me wrong
Says the poet to the moonlight
Says the singer to the song
It's enough just to stay upright
Upright in every single way
Pour your love into your children
Until there's nothing left to say
Pour your love into your children
Until there's nothing left to say<start>I am here, in silent fear
Waiting for you
No one can see, the hurt I feel
It pulls, it tears, my soul
Chorus:
You don't feel
You don't care
Your so wicked
Take away, take away
This cross I bare
This burden shared, won't pull me down
Won't hold me down
(Chorus)
Smile she said, turn your head
Walk away
It's in your hand, your hands
Your hands
(Chorus)<start>Got to get out more
Get in the place
Got to work out more
And sort out my face
I've got all the 'zines that tell me what to eat
And I'm tired of being told what to wear on my feet
And I don't have the time to get all worked up
About the year on the street
And it's not my fault, I can find my way
Yeah it's not my fault, there goes another day
I've been here too long, do I have to change
Into what it takes
To make it number one?
I feel out of favour
I don't look like a picture
You think I'm a loser,
But I can see through you
You're running around like you're running the country
I know that you think that you've got one on me
Ear to the ground, like the boy about town
Can't get nothing to fit me
And it's not my fault, I can find my way
Yeah it's not my fault, there goes another day
I've been here too long, do I have to change
Into what it takes
To make it number one?<start>Tilted just a bit to the wrong side
Mother Mary your tea's in the oven
My head's got caught in the red tape
Voodoo sunset, morning Jesus
Marilyn Manson just fell over
Cos his dress got caught in his high heels
Twist the world upside downstairs
It's all about the shouting
And all I need is you
But you don't know it's true
Morten Harkets' brand new go cart
Foul mouthed and smelling of onions
Lost my keys and I can't get in now
Fine day for a queen she union
And all I need is you
But you don't know it's true<start>Welcome to my Christmas song

Now<start>I must have been crazy
I think I was being brave
I think I was Bruce Lee
I might have been Michael Caine
So give me something to cover my eyes
Weakness and distress what am I
"A, be	, see, D, you're in the belly of me"
You eat, you sleep, you breathe something delicious
You spill, you grip, you squeeze something delicious
You peel, you strip, you bleed something delicious
Delicious
I must be confused
Oh, its so typical
Some fleshy temptation
And the sweetness only improves
So, give me something to cover my eyes
Weakness and distress, what am I
"tree to fruit, apple to seed, you are the A in adam and eve"
You eat, you sleep, you breathe something delicious
You spill, you grip, you squeeze something delicious
You peel, you strip, you bleed something delicious
Delicious, something delicious
Give all your hope to me..
"tree to fruit, apple to seed".
Make all your love to me
You eat, you sleep, you breathe something delicious
You spill, you grip, you squeeze something delicious
You say you think you are something delicious
Something delicious, something delicious
You say you think you hold something delicious
So, save some of your hope for me
"was it as good for you as it was for me?"
I'm in the belly, in the belly, in the belly<start>I'm walkin' through the summer nights
Jukebox playing low
Yesterday everything was goin' too fast
Today it's moving too slow
I got no place left to turn
I got nothing left to burn
Don't know if I saw you
If I would kiss you or kill you
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
I got nothing to go back to now
Maybe they'll get me, and maybe they won't
But not tonight and it won't be here
There are things that I could say but I don't
I know the mercy of God must be near
I've been ridin' the midnight train
I got ice water in my veins
I would be crazy if I took you back
It would go up against any rule
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
Sufferin' like a fool
When the last rays of daylight go down
Buddy you're older no more
I can hear church bells ringin' in the yard
I wonder who they're ringin' for
Oh I know I can't win
But my heart, it just won't give in
I see nothin' to be gained by any explanation
There are no words that need to be said
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
Blues wrapped around my head<start>Visions
Of the apocalypse
A deep red vortex
Burned the sky
And mankind lies dying
And ten beasts arise
Waging eternal war
Forevermore
"From the sea he rises
Creating armies on either shore
Turning man against his brother
Till man exists no more"
The blossom all faded
The mountains quake before me
The hills melt to dust
And run into my spine
Where life has no value
Where you are forever alone
And the misery of life drowns you
One last time
When you are forever alone
Forever<start>Received news of your misfortune
And it's scratching out my eyes
Biting at my heart but I've got something to offer
So this isn't a time to hide my hands
Still I hide my heart, still I hide my heart
This is where the rubber meets the road
It's where we forget our transgressions and move on
I'll carry you burden for certain you have heard
Of hands that long for you to hold them
The ticket's golden, the ticket's golden
If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
It's there that you will find me listening
(You can take tomorrow, dip it in a dream)
Separate the sorrow 'cause I'm tearing off my face
So you won't hurt alone
Lets start today make your mind up
Grab a weapon, move on<start>In Newry Town I was bred and born
In Steven's Green now I'll die in scorn.
I served my time to the saddling trade
but I turned out to be, I turned out to be a roving blade.
At seventeen I took a wife
I loved her dearly as I love life
And for to keep both fine and gay
I took to robbing, I took to robbing on the King's highway.
I never robbed any poor man yet
Nor any tradesman has cause to fret
I rob the lords and their ladies bright
I take their jewels, I take their jewels to my heart's delight.
To Covent Garden I make my way
With my dear wife for to see the play
Lord Fielding's corps they did me pursue
And I was taken, I was taken by that cursed crew.
My father cried, "Oh, my darling son"
My wife she wept and said, "I'm undone"
My mother tore her white locks and cried,
"'Twas in the cradle, 'twas in the cradle that he should have died."
And when I'm dead and in my grave
A flashy funeral pray let me have
With six bold highwaymen to carry me
Give them good broadswords, good broadswords and liberty.
Six pretty maidens to bear my pall
Give them white ribbons and garlands all
For when I'm dead, aye they'll speak the truth
He was a wild and a wicked youth.<start>I never quite know what to do
When I'm with you
(When I'm with you)
I'm never really sure if I'm doin' things right
I never know the words to say
The games to play,
But that's okay
I bet that I could get you through the night
Oh, I could really love you
I swear (I swear)
It's true (It's true)
There isn't much I'm certain of
But this much I can do
Oh, I could really love you
I know there's lots of other men
Who talk of love
(They'll talk of love)
They'll sweep you off your feet with the way they live
After all those champagne highs
And quick goodbyes
You'll realize there's something more
That only I could give
Oh, I could really love you
I swear (I swear)
It's true (It's true)
There isn't much I'm certain of
But this much I can do
Oh, I could really love you
And even though you're waiting for your perfect love
You don't have to wait around no more
I could really love you
I swear (I swear)
It's true (It's true)
There isn't much I'm certain of
But this much I can do
Oh, I could really love you

They took a lot of time
Getting it right on this girl
I said, Mary-Ann
You're better than the world
They did a lot of things right on this girl
Had a lot of girlfriends
I should have known them
Click your heels and count back from there
Do you want to go back?
You should have known
That the butterfly in reverse here is me
Mary-Ann
You're better than the world
They took a lot of time
Getting it right on this girl
I said, Mary-Ann
You're better than the world
They did a lot of things right on this girl
Where'd you want to go to
With nothing beside you
But webbing and curfews and rain?
And everything that hurts you
Is locked up inside you
Like butterflies with wings
And other perfect things
We go swimming in the sunshine
Dangling from clotheslines
Separate and fall into me
But did you ever see me?
Me, absolutely?
Me, but all you, but still me?
Mary-Ann
You're better than the world
They took a lot of time
Getting it right on this girl, I said
Mary-Ann
You're better than the world
They did a lot of things right on this girl<start>This is where the helicopters came to take me away
This is where the children used to play
This is only half a mile away from the attack
This is where my life changed in a day,
And then it changed back
Buried in the din of rotor noise and close explosions
I do my best to synthesize the sounds and my emotions
This is where the allies bombed the school,
They say by mistake
Here nobody takes me for a fool, just for a fake
Later at the hotel bar, the journalists are waiting
I hurry back to my guitar while they're commiserating
And I'll be leaving soon
I'll be leaving soon
Just as soon as we were on the ground,
We're back in the jet
Just another three-day foreign tour we'd never forget
It's hard to sympathize with all this devastation
Hopping 'round from site to site like tourists on vacation
And I'll be leaving soon
I'll be leaving soon
I can't help anyone 'cause everyone's so cold
Everyone's so skeptical of everything they're told
And even I get sick of needing to be sold
Though it's only half a month away, the media's gone
An entertaining scandal broke today, but I can't move on
I'm haunted by a story and I do my best to tell it
Can't even give this stuff away, why would I sell it?
Everybody's laughing, while at me they point a finger
A world that loves its irony must hate the protest singer
So I'll be leaving soon
I'll be leaving soon
I'll be leaving soon
I'll be leaving soon<start>Instrumental<start>If money talks than I'm a mime,
If time is money than I'm out of time
And I was once with a million quid
Have a seat I'll tell ya what I did
Can't sit down because I'm a dancer,
And you know that I'm the answer
Die slow die fast now
Cause its never going to last now
We'll karaoke all night long,
We'll Macarena 'til the break of dawn
We'll drive around until the morning light
All night, all night, all night, all night
Baby, you got to single before you turn,
I think you're heading for the disco burn
Cause the future is in the future,
And the past is a big brick wall,
You know I need to make you understand now,
I'm a man not a disco ball
Can't sit down because I'm a dancer,
And you know that I'm the answer
Die slow die fast now
Cause its never going to last now
We'll karaoke all night long,
We'll Macarena 'til the break of dawn
We'll drive around until the morning light
All night all night all night all night
We'll karaoke all night long,
We'll Macarena 'til the break of dawn
We'll drive around until the morning light
All night, all night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all night<start>Freaks collecting stained-glass rubies
Pillowed gently on a strand
Bearing looks of frenzied blankness
Slowing down their B.B. King
Middle class suburban children
Wearing costumes that reveal
Blindly follow recent pipers
With their mystical appeal, for now
So I'm leavin' for the country, to try and rest my head
'Cause if I hang around this scene too long
You know babe, I'll be dead
All the changes superficial
Apathy, still a king
Liberal reactionaries
Never dealing anything, for now<start>I've got the sweetest little angel
And I love the way that she spread her wings
I've got the most adorable sweet little angel
And I love the way that she spread up her wings
When she put her arms around me
I get joy, I get joy, I get joy and everything
Listen to this will ya
I asked my baby for a nickel
And you know what, she gave me a twenty dollar bill, that ain't all
Now listen to this, I asked my baby, my baby
My own sweet baby for a nickel
And she gave me a twenty dollar bill
That's what makes me think
I've got such a sweet little angel
And if she should be sad to leave me
I would break down and cry
If my baby should leave
I think I would lose my poor old horrible mind
If my baby should leave
I do believe I would lose my mind
Because you know what
I've got this sweetest little angel
And I love the way and I love every way
That she spread her wings<start>Childs/Paris

Now I slipped out the door and I'm runnin' free
Young and wild like I'll always be
But the man in the bed isn't me
And these tremblin' hands, they're not mine
Now my hands are strong and steady all the time
They can swing a sledge hammer or soothe a baby that's cryin'
These trembling hands, they're not mine
Now the nurse over there doesn't know
That I ain't some helpless old so-and-so
I could have broken her heart not that long ago
Now the nurse over there doesn't know
That the man in the bed isn't me
'Cause I slipped out the door and I'm runnin' free
Young and wild like I'll always be
The man in the bed isn't me
I'm the man I've always been
I'm the kid who rode the rails through the Great Depression
I fought in the big war and marched for the Union
I'm the man I've always been
So don't believe what the doctors say
They're just makin' things up so they can get paid
Yeah, and it ain't me they're talkin' about anyway
So don't believe what the doctors say
'Cause the man in the bed isn't me
Well I slipped out the door and I'm finally free
Young and wild like I'll always be
No the man in the bed isn't me
No the man in the bed isn't me
No the man in the bed isn't me<start>Pick me up, love!

You've got a lot to learn.
So I'm your best friend,
You love me, and
Well I'll tell you something:
"We're on the road to messy."
Now the bees behind my eyes sing "beware,"
But my bee-stung tongue wants in there.
Beware, beware, beware of me.
If your heart is not on my side,
if your heart is not on my side,
if your heart is not on my side,
You're not on my side anymore.
I steal a piece of your diary.
I don't think that looks like me.
Am I so cold, now that I'm older?
I tell you stories,
That doesn't mean you know me.
Now the bees behind my eyes sing, "beware,"
But my bee-stung tongue wants in there.
So come at me with mouth open wide,
And I, like a jerk, I crawl inside.
Beware, beware, beware of me.
If your heart is not on my side,
If your heart is not on my side,
If your heart is not on my side, you're not on my side anymore.<start>Oh I'm waiting for the answer to the question in my soul
Lord why did you lead me here?
I take a look around and a desperate world surrounds me
I know I'm not of this place, but its here and in my face
All that I am wants to run
God I feel hopeless and undone
Lift me up above it all
I'm feeling broken and alone
Don't let me turn to stone
Lift my heart above it all
I've lost my hope tonight
And I'm praying for the strength to carry on
Lord lift me above it all
Now I'm waiting for a glimpse of hope in an eye
But a flash of sunlight shows a faded gray
Cause these streets are hard and cold
And the alleys burn like coal with a stench of helplessness
And all the life that's been misspent
And all that I am wants to run
God I feel helpless and undone
Lift me up above it all
I'm feeling broken and alone
Don't let me turn to stone
Lift my heart above it all
I've lost my hope tonight
And I'm praying for the strength to carry on
Lord lift me above it all
Bridge
Maybe I'm not supposed to fly
Maybe you want me here tonight
To lift them up above it all
When they're broken and alone
Don't let me turn to stone
Lift them up above it all
Cause they cannot stand alone
And they're praying for the strength to carry on
Lift us up above it all
When we're broken and alone
Don't let us turn to stone
Lift us up above it all
Because we cannot stand alone
And we're praying for the strength to carry on
Lord will you lift us up above it all<start>They'll look you in the eyes and stone you,
Then turn and disown you.
Don't you let em take the fight outta you.
They'll walk all over your name
Till they find someone else to blame.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.
Secrets hide their lies
Inside hidden alibis.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.
They put the world on a hook,
It's worse every time I look.
Don't let em take the fight outta you.
I would rather take your punch
Than not give you a shot.
I'd rather find out who you are
Than who you're not.
Should've known better than to mistake business for love.
Should've known better than to mistake a fist for love.
It will be in your 'on' until you're not
Needed any longer.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.
Don't believe the headlines,
Check for yourself sometimes.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.
The lies you live become you,
The love you lose, it numbs you.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.
You say that you've arrived,
That's just a high class bribe.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.
I would rather take your punch
Than not give you a shot.
I'd rather find out who you are,
Than who you're not.
Should've known better than to mistake business for love.
Should've known better than to mistake a fist for love.
There's always someone younger,
Someone with more hunger.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.
They'll say you're one and only
They'll straight up leave you lonely.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.
Like a transplant patient
Waiting for a donor.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.
Like a half empty balloon
After a party in the corner.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.<start>If I end up alone
Across the barren sand dunes
I see my true self
I am burning inside for you
Live in a curse
lost in desire
your touch
I can not hurt
I can not cry, I can not I am numb
Don't say it
Don't say it loud
Don't say it
Don't say it now
Oh I know I came in here myself
To here and ever after
Oh you sent me a kiss, with a spell
I fear the ever after
A sting to the eyes
The trace here of you
Still has bite
It can weaken the legs
buckle knees
In a fight<start>When I was young you said to me
How I would grow to find
A world of hope and wonder
That you would leave behind
So now I look around me
I see where you were wrong
The tears that flow for equal rights
Have fallen far too long
Way down south in the township
Way down south in the plain
Does the sun still rise on the land of lies
Every day in fear, every day in shame
And I was told no man was judged
By color or by creed
So why do some have streets of gold
While others only need
No, you cannot tell me
There is pride in fearing pain
A nation born in a country torn
I know the rightful claim
Way down south in the township
Way down south in the plain
Does the sun still rise on the land of lies
Every day in fear, every day in shame
Take away the newsreel
And take the world to task
One man one vote as nations quote
Is that too much to ask
And now I look around me
I see where you were wrong
The tears that flow for equal rights
Have fallen far too long
Way down south in the township
Way down south in the plain
Does the sun still rise on the land of lies
Every day in fear, every day in shame<start>Never could carry a tune
Never knew where to start
You came along when ev'rything was wrong
And put a song in my heart
[Chorus]
Dear, when you smiled at me
I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me
Started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
'Twas like a breath of spring
I heard a robin sing
About a next set apart
All nature seemed to be
In perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
Your eyes made skies seem blue again
What else could I do again
But keep repeating through again
"I love you, I love you"
I still recall the thrill
I guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
Dear, with your lips to mine
A rhapsody divine
Zing! Went the strings of my heart<start>Yeah here comes the night, isn't it exciting
All your fantasies come true, oh yeah
When it's dark enough, promises of love
Thing we've never even try to do
[Chorus:]
Here comes the night
Here comes the night
Here comes the night...
Wonder what she's like, you'll find out to tonight
She's still in the dark like you, oh yeah
Cities come alive, painting made of life
Oh the magic that the night can do
[Chorus]
The sun is set, oh yeah
Twilight, all right
Here comes the night
[Chorus]<start>Trans fixated on the big blue screen
Its your window to the outside
A melancholy dream
A medium upon which you build reality
This episodic currency
That everybody needs
Somebodies delivery lulls you to sleep
The man behind the weather map
The editor in chief
They control two worlds
Power and disease
And you cannot suppress you curiosity
But see it's only entertainment
Superficial urgency
Poster board mentality
Only entertainment
Tightly constrained
The buzz that remains
Is the story of how we run our lives
Many our the people poor and suffering
From the lack of coverage
From the transmission beam
And if it ever gets there
You'll be offended too
'cause you cannot distinguish
Chicanery from truth
See it's only entertainment
A superficial episode
As life continues to unfold
Only entertainment
Controlled and copied
They've planted the seed<start>Suffer from greed and look for more
Try to get higher, try to get by
Live your life without prayer
Easy like the catcher in the rye
Or set out on this journey with me
Tired of all the lies
Milk and honey overdose
In the world of artificial smiles
Do we bow, boy?
You say you're happy then you cry at night
The river of anguish will flow
Rise up and shake off the pain
Let off steam, let the strength show
Unmask the torturer
Unmask him, be brave
Unmask the conqueror
The one that turns your life into your grave
Do we bow, boy?
Do we bow, boy?
Do we bow or do we fight for it?
Do we bow, boy?
Do we bow or do we fight for it?
Do we bow, boy?
Do we bow or do we cut them dead?
(Position - profession - possession - obsession)<start>I've got leather on my shoes,
And I've got a dream to live,
There is nothing left to lose,
So I'm going,
I've got a suitcase here in my hand,
And I've got a hungry heart,
And I'm going to join the millions,
There before me, on the freedom road;
No-one's coming to my door,
And all my friends have gone,
There's no work here anymore,
It's deserted,
And though I know I hate to leave,
From this land that I love,
There's a new tomorrow waiting,
Yes it's shining on the freedom road,
On the freedom road;
Oh sometimes it's going to be lonely,
Sometimes it will be sad,
But I've got to keep on going,
Until I hold that promised land,
In the palm of my hand;
Nothing ventured, nothing gained or won,
Without a hard fight,
We would never reach the sun,
Without trying,
And when we're a million miles from home,
Out in the starry night,
We will see we're not alone,
In the heavens, out on freedom road,
Out on freedom road,<start>She fell hard for a Celtic rocker
Turned her whole life upside down
Her old man don't know what to do with her
Out drinkin' Guinness, buyin' her own round
She tossed her J. Crew in the garbage
She sportin' tartan, Doc Marten boots
She wear her scally, oh, so stylish
Told her old man she's discoverin' her roots
She know the songs and the bands that sing 'em
The Murphs, the Mollies, 47, the Dubs
She readin' Tim Pat Coogan biographies
Showin' off her tattoos down the pub
She moshin' hard at all the concerts
Know the names of all the boys in the band
The rhythm section dreams about her
Lady fiddle player wants to hold her hand
Someday she goin' back to Ireland
Scotland, Wales, the isle of man
Find out exactly where she come's from
At least when she's drinkin' that's the plan
She got her eyes on the Uilleann Pipes player
Meet him later at the hotel bar
They're gonna do some serious drinkin'
Like all them Celtic rock and roll stars
She's rockin' hard at all the festivals
Dublin, Milwaukee, Chicago too
From New York City to San Francisco
She's a part of the Celtic who's who
She takin' lessons on the guitar
She can dance the walls of limerick too
Someday she be on stage here with us
She be a Celtic rocker too
She know the songs and the bands that sing 'em
The Murphs, the Mollies, 47, the Clash
So don't go messin' with the lady
N beidh a leithad ann ars
Oh yeah, little Celtic rocker
Meet me backstage at the van
C'mon little Celtic rocker
Gonna show you what it's like
In a rock and roll band<start>I got a story about D.C. to tell
And I don't think you're going to like it very well
It's about boys and girls, and the rich and the poor
But what if no one can afford to live here anymore?
Well I guess you can, 'cause you got a trust fund
You're so comfortable, but you're the only one
So I'm gonna turn it up and shake you down
'Cause your past is too clean, gonna throw it all around
You were brought up well, but your daddy never taught you
To keep your mouth shut.
Well omigod!
We don't do that here!
Well now we do
You'll see what we're gonna do about you.
You're taking one thing that one girl does
And making it represent all of us
So what do you know about the catty girls?
The only thing you know is your rich boy world
You're talking politics on your pedestal
And you half-baked idea of "what it means to be a girl"
But you can't feel how we suffer or we bleed
You can't give us what we want, much less what we need.
Well omigod!
Well I know what you said!
Yeah you can't run!
You say the girls are dum, but not this one!
You narrow your world to the safest girl
And up your nose with all the rest
Well we do exist and we do insist
That a life that's boring is the life without risk
You don't know what it's like to be harrassed all day
Then to be told that you're only in the way
We're living in fear, trying not to disappear
So yeah, we're kinda weird, not normal, no way!
Well omigod!
We don't say that here!
Wll that's not cool
You say the boys are too, but why not you?
So I got a story about D.C. to tell
But I don't think you're goinna like it very well
It's about "Nice Guys" and the girls who let them
Be innocent as rain and about as thoughtless.
You can bring the keg and I'll bake the cake
And we'll raise our glass to another mistake
So what if us girls try to tear ourselves apart?
Well we're here to tell you that it's time to get smart!<start>Power 's in your hand
You stand and decide
It's always been a man
Who starts to write the next line
Money's in the hands
Of a chosen few
There's got to be a man
To think for me and you
But this time you see we know
You don't hold the key we know
This time you see we know
We won't let you go ...
Divided people
Central power
Who's gonna be the next clown
Who's gonna break us down
And if it's not a man
Sometimes it's all the same
Iron Dick vs Iron Lady
Do you really care 'bout me
But this time you see we know
You don't hold the key we know
This time you see we know
We won't let you go ...<start>Pop culture with a gun
Watch it wheeze in the air like a dying balloon
A mistake dawned on me
And the rest of my tribe "your wish is our command"
No really, its OK
Give yourself a group hug and a pat on the back
No really, it's all right
Pose your best for a shot from the firing squad
Choosing my defense
I'll stay on the fence
Sneak a gun through the gates of heaven
Raiding tomorrow's prayers with a stained silver bullet
Oh how it kills me waiting to follow through
On a dare
Pop culture with a pill
Watch it make all the worms in your mind disappear
Maybe so, maybe not
Never sure if it's me underneath the white sheet
Halloween, Halloween
With a mask I can be your new friend for a while
Trick or treat, trick or treat
There's a razor blade inside your candy bar
Pop culture on your skin
You cannot keep your fingers away from your face
Memories are haunting me
Like fish floating dead at the top of a tank<start>I reach across the table each morning
And gently touch your hand
As she pours my morning coffee
She smiles, I know she understands
The way she says good morning
That look in her eyes tells me so
I'm her man, she understands me well
I know my woman knows
My woman knows
I love her with the love that only grows
My woman knows
Sometimes I fail to tell her so
But I know my woman knows
I know sometimes I've hurt her
I helped with those lines in her face
And I take the love for granted
That nothing in this world can replace
But every time I hold her
That look in her eyes lets me know
That I'm her man, she understands me well
I know my woman knows
My woman knows
I love her with the love that only grows
My woman knows<start>Shadow boxing in my head again
Lying here beside you in the dark
Making mountains out of nothin'
Hoping against hope
And making deals with God
Then I feel you stir beside me
And you don't say a word
But still I know
And in your eyes I see the reason
In your smile I see the road that takes me home
In my heart I know the answer
That all the things I looked so hard to find
Were right here all along...right here all along
Sometimes life can make you tired
You get so used to being on your own
Looking for something to count on (Something to count on baby)
Wishing for a love that's carved in stone
But I can hear you through my worry
Your voice is telling me "let go"
[Chorus]
When I needed someone to count on
You were right here all along
When I needed someone to lean on
You were right here all along
And when I needed a hand to hold
You were right here all along
And when I thought I had nobody baby
You were right here all along
[Chorus: x2]
I needed a hand to hold
Needed shelter from the cold
I needed a hand to hold
You give me shelter from the cold baby yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Just when I thought I had nobody baby
You were right here all along
And when I thought I had nobody, babe
You were right here all along<start>As I wake today same as yesterday
I get in my car the poor turn my wheels
There's so much today, who's got time to listen?
As we fulfill our dreams the shame is left unseen
Why should someone lose so that I get by?
Why should someone pay just to send me high?
[Chorus]
No one has to cry while I can smile
No one owns the sky so blue above you
Somewhere in this world
There's a field where we all play
The secret's in your eyes
No one has to cry
There's no self-control as we play our roles
It's all dog eat dog, we're all dressed for show
As we plot and scheme full of American dreams
Who says it's fair who gets the opportunities?
There are some who live without so that I get by
They pay the price for doubting just to send me high.
[Chorus]<start>Don't try and tell me how to live
I don't care if I will never find away to die
I don't know if I will ever find a way I'll never try to
Decide and will I find
An eye for an eye
Too many days at home staying up and drinking
Jerking off myself again tonight
I don't care if I will ever find a way I'll never
Die to decide and will I find
Too many days at home staying up and drinking
Puking on myself again tonight I don't care
If I will ever find a way I'll never die to decide
And will I find<start>I fell from Holy Moses mountain, where love's a slippery slope
And all the others I've been hanging with, never gave me too much rope
And then one day she came to me, love at first sight, head to toes
I love her wild, my mountain child and that's just how she goes
And here she got
Hey I can't stop loving you
'Cause it's all I wanna do
Yeah the world needs more of this, tell me what you put into that kiss, yeah
Now keep that coming on, let me hear my favorite song
Yeah you're all I wanna do, 'cause I can't stop loving you
Got me a good old kinda cowboy
He got my picture on the fridge
And the first time that he kissed me, we was high up on the ridge
And when we came down from the mountain, I will ride with ma kin
And for all it costs, for getting lost, there ain't no better sin
Oh, yeah
You know I can't stop loving you
'Cause it's all I wanna do
Yeah the world needs more of this, tell me what you put into that kiss
Now keep that coming on, let me hear my favorite song
Yeah you're all I wanna do, 'cause I can't stop loving you
When I wake up and see your face
All that jump in a pigtail lace
And that there's nowhere else I would rather be
Then all tied up in this rhapsody
Hey I can't stop loving you
'Cause it's all I wanna do
Yeah the world needs more of this, tell me what you put into that kiss,
Now keep that coming on, let my hear my favorite song
Yeah you're all I wanna do, 'cause I can't stop loving you<start>"A quoi sert une chanson

Je veux Ãªtre utile
Ã vivre et Ã  rÃªver.
Comme la lune fidÃ¨le
A n'importe quel quartier,
Je veux Ãªtre utile
Ã ceux qui m'ont aimÃ©,
Ã ceux qui m'aimeront
Et Ã  ceux qui m'aimaient.
Je veux Ãªtre utile
Ã vivre et Ã  chanter.
Dans n'importe quel quartier
D'une lune perdue,
MÃªme si les maÃ®tres parlent
Et qu'on ne m'entend plus,
MÃªme si c'est moi qui chante
Ã n'importe quel coin de rue,
Je veux Ãªtre utile
Ã vivre et Ã  rÃªver.
Ã quoi sert une chanson
Si elle est dÃ©sarmÃ©e?<start>Oh honey hush, yes you talk too much
Oh honey hush, yes you talk too much
Listenin' to your conversation is just about to separate us
You start talkin' in the morning, you're talkin' all day long
I'm tryin' to figure out what I did wrong
Oh honey hush, yes you talk too much
Listenin' to your conversation is just about to separate us
I stay out all day long, you know I hate to come home
Everything I do, seems to be wrong
Oh honey hush, yes you talk too much
Listenin' to your conversation is just about to separate us
I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't rest in peace
I'll be better off, you know, walkin' the streets
Oh honey hush, yes you talk too much
Listenin' to your conversation is just about to separate us<start>Your town is full of goblins, crooks and murder
Your mother thinks you love the next door neighbour
Your record player speaks to you all evening
While she's down stairs smashing things as she's cleaning
Oh to be you because you're a genius girl through and through
In summer time you dress us in winter clothing
Your school-yards not a place you like frequenting
Your fathers disappeared on someone's push bike when they
Ask you "are you ok?"
Well what's it look like?
Just look at you still you're a genius girl through and through
And every year goes past just like a clock
You never see it stop
And you could always be alone now maybe
You should take a trek
Sometime but we'll watch over you
We always do because you're a genius girl through and through
Are you ok? What's come over you all this
Crashing buses and stealing cars while your peers are asleep
Or is it a play only you attend like some girl genius
And you could will always be alone now maybe
You should take the trek sometime.<start>Maybe I'll need you maybe I wont
Well someday I want to but right now I don't
Is it so hard to understand
I'm just a girl without a plan
You hold on too tight
We'll take a few steps back tonight
I don't need you to save me
I'd rather crash and burn
Don't need you to tell me
How to live before I learn
If I fall apart if it breaks my heart
I still got all the pieces that you gave me
That you gave me
Maybe you'll tell me I told you so
But maybe my screw ups is how I will know
Why can't you let me hit the ground?
Not like I'm lost and can't be found
Don't wanna fight but take a few steps back tonight
I don't need you to save me
I'd rather crash and burn
Don't need you to tell me
How to live before I learn
If I fall apart if it breaks my heart
I still got all the pieces that you gave me
Don't need you to save me
I know that its easier to control
Is it that hard to let go?
Don't tell me the ?
Maybe I'll need you but maybe I won't
Well someday I want to but right now I don't
I don't need you to save me
I'd rather crash and burn
Don't need you to tell me
How to live before I learn
If I fall apart if it breaks my heart
I still got all the pieces that you gave me
That you gave me
That you gave me
The pieces that you gave me<start>Blessed morning rays
Blessed ice
Kiss the hand that offers this
Kiss the hand that offers life
There's no one alone
Scream, "I'll always need you"
There's no love awakened
In your home, yeah!
Oh, there's something out there alone
The coldest sun that I found
There's something out there alone
The coldest sun where I lie
Empty offering
That you hold
Kiss the hand that clings to life
Blessed cold, yeah!
Oh, there's something out there alone
The coldest sun that I found
There's something out there alone
The coldest sun that I found
There's something out there alone
The coldest sun that I found
Coldest sun that I found<start>day by day i replay "Catcher in the Rye" and i'm not afraid to say, " god damnit, you were right" ive found everything already. danger just hides. someday i hope, you explode. someday i hope youre all exposed. and i'll be in the ruins of you, helping you peice yourself. you know that youd do the same for me when i need that help. from all the grey clouds, and every break down...hope you hear me. youre the full half of my glass. youre the reason i'll pass the test, i'm trying my best. and if the world ends in our sleep, at least we will be in the same dream. in love. i'm in love with a memory. of all the days when we couldnt stop dancing. theres a future in your heart dear, and i will be the feature to fill it. i will be the reason you see no need to kill it. i will be...<start>When you meet someone you don't know
But you know them just the same
You begin wondering if it by chance could be
An acquaintance from yesterday's train
Well there's something in her eye that you've seen before
Maybe a memory or a mistress from another world
But you know the trees are green and the baby cries
From dust to dust, yet nothing dies
You'll never know where we are in this endless place
Or where we are in this endless space
But we know the trees are green and the baby cries
From dust to dust, yet nothing dies
Yesterday's is rollin', can you touch it through the mist
Did you meet someone on yesterday's train
Can you tell it with a kiss
Can you tell it with a kiss<start>Dream yourself awake
Can't make it through the night
Wicked dreams will haunt you
When the morning light shines
You try to find your way outside
Just another day
You try to let them shine
The people disappoint you
Makes you wonder why you cry
You can almost see the end of you
So come on stand up
Yeah put your hands up
It ain't wrong to be strong
And it's gonna be gone
And then they won't come back to you
No, no, no, no, wake up
Try not to break up
If they're holding you down
Then you rise to the top
Cause you're a bad, bad girl
And you just can't stop, no, no, no
Give yourself a break
Listen to your heart
Let your conscience guide you
Never let your guard down
Find out the best of you
Everything you do
And what is done to you
Doesn't have to change you
It only makes you stronger and stronger
The more they take away from you
So come on stand up
Yeah, put your hands up
It ain't wrong to be strong
And it's gonna be gone
And then they won't come back to you
No, no, no, no, wake up
Try not to break up
If they're holding you down
Then you rise to the top
Cause you're a bad, bad girl
And you just can't stop, no, no, no
Cause you're a bad, bad girl
And you just can't stop, no, no, no
You won't lead no beggars life
And you sure don't need their bad advice
Or their five cents worth of what they think of you
Sometimes they're not so into you
Keep your head up above that line, you know
Everybody loses sometimes
Shame, shame, shame
The things they've done to you
So come on stand up
Yeah, put your hands up
It ain't wrong to be strong
And it's gonna be gone
And then they won't come back to you
No, no, no, no, wake up
Try not to break up
If they're holding you down
Then you rise to the top
Cause you're a bad, bad girl
And you just can't stop, no, no, no<start>I drink sweet wine for breakfast, I slept about an hour or so
Smiled a little in the silence deciding on where to go.
"Meet me under the whale in the Natural History Museum,"
I think that's what she said, a little bit sad about having to leave them.
Yawning in the sun, like a child I run.
But don't do it if you don't want to, I wouldn't do a thing like that.
No, don't it if you don't want to, I wouldn't do a thing like that.
How little do you speak of beauty, isn't it a shame, what ho
Maybe you should go get a power ring, you'd make all your troubles go.
There she stood in drag, just-a lookin' cool in astrakhan.
She's lookin' just a little wiped out, she said I looked like Peter Pan.
Yawning in the sun, oh baby, like a child I run.
But don't do it if you don't want to,
I wouldn't do a thing like that.
Oh no, no, don't do it if you don't want to,
I wouldn't do a thing like that.
Don't do it<start>Listen everybody let me tell you 'bout the rock'n'roll
Feel that rhythm and it's really gonna thrill your soul
She said come along with me, to a land of make believe
She said whamalamabamalama rock'n'roll is king
She loves that rock'n'roll and she plays it all night long
That's all she ever tells me when I call her on the telephone
She says feel that jumpin' beat, and git up on your feet
She says whamalamabamalama rock'n'roll is king
Oh let those guitars play
Play for me play for me
Oh let that song ring out
That's how it's meant to be
It rolls like a train that's comin' on down the track
She rolled over Beethoven and she gave Tchaikovsky back
She loves that drivin' beat, she goes dancin' on down the street
She said whamalamabamalama rock'n'roll is king
Oh let those guitars play
Play for me play for me
Oh let that song ring out
That's how it's meant to be<start>There's no method in my madness, no craft, no guile
No expertise, no self assuring smile
No wizardry or witchcraft, no crass deceit
No dark conspiracies, I stand on my own two feet
I'm coming through just like Jack Ruby
I ragged around the edges but I got control
There's no way around it and I got control
I reach out for my program, still got control
Straight down to business, who needs control
I've got panache just like Jack Ruby
I don't beg forgiveness, I don't beg at all
But I beg to differ cos I got the ball
There was no invitation, you're not my type
And what's gone, it ain't worth having, kiss it all goodbye
Right on the money just like Jack Ruby<start>I've got the skin of a shark
And I'm gonna make a muscle.
Just holding onto filth
Of the pornagraphic slut.
I've got an ill will
And a pair of brass knuckles.
_________ cutting through ribs.
It's a tour de'force.
Nostalgia (4 times)
___________ on to grease
Cause grease is the word
And I'm never never sure
But I'm sure you're never right.
It's the secret agent man,
And a cartoon hero.

Nostalgia (4 times)<start>Os velhos olhos vermelhos voltaram
Dessa vez
Com o mundo nas costas
E a cidade nos pÃ©s
Pra que sofrer se nada Ã© pra sempre?
Pra que correr
Se nunca me vejo de frente
Parei de pensar e comecei a sentir
Nada como um dia apÃ³s dia
Uma noite, um mÃªs
Os velhos olhos vermelhos voltaram
De vez
Os velhos olhos vermelhos enganam
Sem querer
Parecem claros, frios, distantes
NÃ£o tÃªm nada a perder
Por que se preocupar por tÃ£o pouco?
Por que chorar
Se amanhÃ£ tudo muda de novo?
Parei de pensar e comecei a sentir
Nada como um dia apÃ³s dia
Uma noite, um mÃªs
Os velhos olhos vermelhos voltaram de vez<start>In days gone by we chose our side
Showed them we weren't afraid to step over the line
Standing fall we would look you in the eye
Cause what we hold true you could never deny
You don't understand what we chose to condemn
You're the one who has made it us against them
Our hearts turn black and our blood runs cold
When we see our country being bought and sold
With eyes of fire we see things today
You could never change us cause it's our way
With eyes of fire we see things today
You could never stop us it's too late
Long ago we learned it's our fight
To try to bring out what they hide from our sight
To show them they have not won our hearts and minds
With their pledges, promises, and campaign lies
With eyes of fire we see what we see
For this country, what it is, and should be
Where an honest man can get ahead and not just by
And say he loves his country with his head held high<start>I am, lost in the crowd
I'm standing in line, I'm feeling so down
And I am, full of doubt
She's not the one, take notice, hear me out
I want her, and need her and you
Always will pull me through
I'm tired, this game's so dumb
She never played, her race is won
I'm tired, can't smile no more
I'll sure cave in, just like before
And I, want her, and need her and you
Always will pull me through
And I, want her, and need her and you
Always will pull me through<start>You know it's all been said before
Melancholy words that fade with the morning sun
I always say that you're the one
Somehow I'm always left undone
Dreams are never like you think
Cause dreams don't really know what it is you really need
Love sees what you could never see
Now I see you
And I never knew
What love could do
[Chorus]
This is my very first love song
I'm gonna sing it for you
This is my very first love song
I'm gonna sing it for you
I know that this is gonna last
No matter how the change may come I'll have you
To lean on
I see it more each passing day
What we've become
How wonderful
To feel this love
[Chorus]
I feel it in my soul
I know it's gonna grow
I feel it in my soul
I know it's gonna grow
I feel it in my soul
[Chorus]<start>Shirts in the closet, shoes in the hall
Mama's in the kitchen, baby and all
Everything is everything
Everything is everything
But you're missing
Coffee cups on the counter, jackets on the chair
Papers on the doorstep, but you're not there
Everything is everything
Everything is everything
But you're missing
Pictures on the nightstand, TV's on in the den
Your house is waiting, your house is waiting
For you to walk in, for you to walk in
But you're missing, you're missing
You're missing when I shut out the lights
You're missing, when I close my eyes
You're missing, when I see the sun rise
You're missing
Children are asking if it's alright
Will you be in our arms tonight?
Morning is morning, the evening falls I got
Too much room in my bed, too many phone calls
How's everything, everything?
Everything, everything
But you're missing, you're missing
God's drifting in heaven, devil's in the mailbox
I got dust on my shoes, nothing but teardrops<start>Lets take a moment and break the ice
So my intentions are known
See I pity in watching you suffer
I know the feeling of feeling of being damned alone
I got a storybook of my own
Don't you see I am your pride
Agent of wealth
Bearer of needs
And you know it's right
I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak
Know me by name
Shepherd of fire
Well I can promise you paradise
No need to serve on your knees
And when you're lost in the darkest of hours
Take a moment and tell me who you see
Won't tell ya who not to be
Now you know I am your pride
Agent of wealth
Bearer of needs
And you know it's right
I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak
Know me by name
Shepherd of fire
Disciple of the cross and champion in suffering
Immerse yourself into the kingdom of redemption
Pardon your mind through the chains of the divine
Make way, the shepherd of fire
Through the ages of time
I've been known for my hate
But I'm a dealer of simple choices
For me it's never too late
I am your pride
Agent of wealth
Bearer of needs
And you know it's right
'Cause I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak
I am your wrath
I am your guilt
I am your lust
And you know it's right
I am your love
I am your stall
I am your trust
Know me by name
Shepherd of fire<start>The battlefield, the smoke has cleared
Silence in sight, the blood lies deep
Look from the hills, the valley calls
Six hundred fall, a lost to all
Someday, somewhere, ever calling
One time, one life, ever falling
Chorus:
And will you remember
The flowers in the fields?
And will you remember
The loss of one so dear
And will you remember
Through the mist of lies?
Remember
Their spirit never dies
Remember
Out of the skies, and into the green
Fueled by the lies, paid by soul
Soldier, hero, well 'Uncle Sam'
He don't want to know
[Chorus;]<start>Lost in a dance
Waiting for the chance
All I really needed was to love you
Night after night
Searchin' for the light
You saved me
You gave me something I could feel
Love is all that matters
Faithful and forever
Keepin' us together
Love is all we need
Prisoner of illusion
Sentence is suspended
Loneliness is ended
Love has set me free
Dreams from the past
Comin' true at last
Never noticed how my life was changing
Now I can see
All that love can be
You saved me
You gave me
Something that was real
Love is all that matters
Faithful and forever
Keepin' us together
Love is all we need
Prisoner of illusion
Sentence is suspended
Loneliness is ended
Love has set me free<start>Fix my new memory with a cold naked stare
Chew up the words but with thoughts beware
Fondness can escalate beyond my repair
Chances the fiction with orchestrate despair
Could these hands blow dry?
I can handle it again
These words collide
I can handle
Happiness is coated in a mindless kicking
Let's fall apart, get up high and leave
Again, these hands blow dry
I can handle it again
These words collide
I can handle
Kill your bizarre mindset, fuckhead
Soldered to a three layered concrete brainwave castration

Soldered to a three layered concrete brainwave castration

Well, I'm the little red rooster
Too lazy to crow the day.
Little red rooster
Too lazy to crow the day.
Keep everything in the barnyard
Upset in every way.
Dogs begin to bark
The hounds begin to howl.
Dogs begin to bark and
The hounds begin to howl.
Look out strange cat people
The rooster's on the prowl.
Yeah, dogs begin to bark

Needs are a passing memory fear not worthy
Belief, a martyr's burden
Heaved upon capable shoulders
Dissuade your charge
Arrive in commonplace with the elect
The furthest plateau
Inside the souls of saints
The old dog has to learn a new trick and more
Or the next trick will be on him
I've drank the oceans dry, I've stopped the time
Embraced the riddle of regret
(Again and again)
Desire, haunt me long
The light of three suns and one star
Watch over me
A square will never fit a circle
No hope, no joke, both bookends burned
I've drown in oceans mine, I woke the dead
And still the dry bones live again

I fought pain with time and hate
Here I stand alone and on fire in a room with a view, a fence with barbwire
Today my world ends and so theirs begins
Slowly trying to justify comparable sins
I stand here alone and unafraid
I've known in my past I've done worse days
May be apart from my dreams and desires yet no man can withhold me from what I most admire
I stood strong through right or wrong
I fought pain with time and hate
I'll fight when they try to strip me of my rights and wont, I wont accept defeat
I may be down but I will not be beat
One voice
With pride I'll keep on striving till I die and never, never will I black out
The streets remain in heart without a doubt
One voice<start>Coming in, coming in, kill the radio silence
Break down in L.A.
Giving up, giving in, to a feeling of violence
There's hell to pay
So, let's light another match, stop living in the past
Where nobody can hear me now
Blow the lock off the cage, watch the children come of age
When their parents stop to take a bow
Nothing takes root in this barren soil
Nothing takes root in this barren soil
Maybe there's no one there at all
Hold on, the worst is yet to come
Save your money for hired guns
Hold strong, when everything you loved is gone
Slow down, stop living in the shadow of a helicopter
Line em' up, on the wall, coming out with their hands up
Give em' all the chair
Let it burn, let it fall, let the end of the world come
Who's left to care?
Nothing tastes takes root in this barren soil
Nothing tastes root but the pain and toil
Maybe there's no one there at all
Hold on, the worst is yet to come
Save your money for the hired guns
Hold strong, when everything you loved is gone
Slow down, stop living in the shadow of a helicopter
Hold on, the worst is yet to come

But I don't mind (I don't mind)
No I don't (I don't mind)
No I don't (I don't mind)
When I've got you next to me
It's been a long time
Since we tripped into this ditch
It's been a long time
Since we drank the a-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-arsenic
It's been a long time
Since we've been insi-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-ide of this tomb
It's been a long time
Since you wore your eh-e-eh-e-eh-e-eh-e-eh-e-expensive French perfume
But I don't mind (I don't mind)
No I don't (I don't mind)
But I don't (I don't mind)
When I've got you next to me
It's been a long time
Since I've seen your smiling face
It's been a long time
Since I've seen a su-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-unny day<start>Yesterday?s breakfast on the table
Pictures scattered on the ground
By my foot there?s you and I laughing
You look so good in the wedding gown
Falling in love for us was easy
But that?s never very hard
Now there?s bills in the mailbox
And branches in the yard
Don?t lose heart
Someday we?re gonna find it
Someday we?re gonna see
Someday we?re gonna find you and me
Someday it?s gonna be like breathing
I know it?s gonna be
Someday we?re gonna find you and me
This is not an accusation
The fault is probably mine
By now I thought we?d be familiar
Some things only come with time
Don?t lose heart
Someday we?re gonna find it
Someday we?re gonna see
Someday we?re gonna find you and me
Someday it?s gonna be like breathing
I know it?s gonna be
Someday we?re gonna find you and me
Hold onto me and I?ll hold onto you
Hold onto me holding onto you
Someday we?re gonna find it
Someday we?re gonna see
Someday we?re gonna find you and me
Someday it?s gonna be like breathing
I know it?s gonna be
Someday we?re gonna find you and me<start>Bummer Time! Bummer Time! Its Bummer Time! Woah! (x4)
I think about you all week long
My mind constantly singing your theme song
And did you know I looked up to you
I want to be just like you
no one knows how it was for me
No one know what you meant to me
Everyone talks about it like they were there
All this nostalgia but nobody cares
Everyone talks about it like they were there
All this nostalgia but nobody cares
I woke up early just for you
I'd wait all week long for you too
And there you were on my t.v.
I thought you were there just for me
Bummer Time! Bummer Time! Its Bummer Time! Woah! (x4)
Every time you came I played along
I didn't know that you'd do me, god
And now your back what can I say
I can't even look at you the same way
no one knows how it was for me
No one know what you meant to me
Everyone talks about it like they were there
All this nostalgia but nobody cares
Everyone talks about it like they were there
All this nostalgia but nobody cares
I woke up early just for you
I'd wait all week long for you too
And there you were on my t.v.
I thought you were there just for me
Bummer Time!<start>(Latimer)
Hotel rooms, sleep eludes me
In this strange life I lead
Occasional friends, likewise lovers
Never wanting what I need
If you could be
Here close to me
I know - love
We were meant for each other
We will love one another
And it won't really matter at all
Who we are
Wake-up calls in the morning
The empty night fades away
You're still there, I'm still faking
Words I always meant to say
If you could be
Here we would see
I know - love
We were meant for each other
We will love one another
And it won't really matter at all
Who we are<start>A husband came home drunk each night
And he thrashed her black, and he thrashed her white
He thrashed her to within an inch of her life
Then he slept like a log, did her husband
As he lay and snored in bed
A strange idea came into her head
She went for the needle, and she went for the thread
And straight to her sleeping husband
She started to stitch with a girlish thrill
With a woman's art, and a seamstress' skill
She pinned and tucked with an iron will
All around her sleeping husband
Husband awoke with a pain in his head
He found he could not move in bed
"Sweet Christ, I've lost the use of me legs!"
Wife just smiled at her husband
Three, six, nine, he drank wine
He got hooked by a stitch in time
She broke, he got choked, and they never went to heaven in a little row boat
Clap clap, clap clap
Clap clap, clap clap
She thrashed him black, she thrashed him blue
With a frying pan and a colander too
With a rolling pin, just a stroke or two
A battered and bleeding husband
Isn't it true what small can do
With a thread, and a stitch, and a thought or two?
He's wiped his slate, his boozing's through
Goodbye to a drunken husband
Kick out the jams, motherfucker!<start>Well it started with a sound I never heard before
Then the pushin' and the pullin' me across the floor
I said the last thing we did the night before we die
Was a little drunk girl with a big red eye
It was another late night in Tokyo
In another dark club after another show
If the morning light could have got inside
We would have seen the girl had a big red eye
So we crashed out a little bit before the quake
Then I held you tight while the hotel shaked
If the walls came down we would have surely died
Never knowin' the girl had a big red eye
But we lived to see ourselves another day
And we laughed out loud with a foot in the grave
Ya see, the camera had a flash and the pictures don't lie
That little drunk girl had a big red eye
And the toxic waste spilled into the sea
And the air stuck like flypaper to me
It's all one big roller-coaster ride
And last night she got on with a big red eye
The greatest lessons we could learn in life
Are always served the day after we die
All I would have missed as I hit the sky
Was that the little drunk girl had a big red eye<start>This time I've had enough
This time I mean it
This time I'm taking off
Fuck this I'm leaving
It's time for me to go
But who knows when
I'll see you again
Sorry teacher it's not that I don't like your class
It's just that now this is more important than if I fail or pass
And tell my boss I'm sorry if he's understaffed
Cause I'll be gone for a while
Perhaps I'll call when I get back
Let's forget all responsibilities
Come along my car fits four including me
Let's go, rock and roll playing on the stereo
On the road, we'll find paradise in the great unknown
Honestly it's not that I don't dig this town
In fact I'm sure I'll miss Ann Arbor
When I leave her frozen grounds
Sorry ladies it's not that you don't rock my world
But I've got too much on my mind
Don't need to worry about a girl
Let's forget all responsibilities
Come along we can squeeze in five uncomfortably
That from which I'm trying to escape
Is still a mystery to me but hey
We'll find out one day
Always expect delay
I will find a way
Yeah!<start>somebody's knocking should i let him in
lord it's the devil, would you look at him
I never thought and i never dreamed he'd have blue eyes and blue jeans
He must have tapped my telephone line. He must have knownI'd bespending my time alone<start>What are you looking at, what do you see?
Is it the truth or a strange fantasy?
Whenever you're watching, changing the scene
The time is a place, this place is a song
Where mothers are distant and fathers are gone
He too may be watching but he's not letting on
Can't dry your eyes or say it's alright
Even though he might and she can't kiss your cheek
As the days become weeks, no rewind, no repeats
Days, nights, wrongs, rights, earthbound starlight
Hey, are you listening?
What is the sound of things that you lose
That you never have found?
You're finding the way or turning around
Dancer with destiny, tempter of fate
The life that you lived is only a taste
Sometimes the sweetest is the time that you waste
I won't dry your eyes or say it's alright
Cause sometimes that's the lie even if she kissed your cheek
Still the days become weeks, no rewind, no repeats
Steal your heart, life is hard, never easy, believe me
There'll be no more questions, maybes or mights
Darkest descends, run out of light
When you go blind, you get second sight
The deeper you dive the greater the heights
So don't dry your eyes or say it's alright
Life is hard, it's a fight even if she kissed your cheek
Still the days become weeks, no rewind, no repeats
As the days become weeks, no rewind, no repeats
Days, nights, wrongs, rights, earthbound starlight<start>Some people think he's good looking
Other people think he's not
Some people don't even know his name
Other people know it by heart
Some people think he likes to go out dancing
Other people not
One guy I know thinks he's hard to get along with
But a lot of people think he's fine
Yeah, a lot of people think he's fine
And he don't even know
Just sees how each day goes
Some people say she's funny
Other people say she's dumb
Some people say she's stuck-up
Others say she's shy
Some people like her for her charm
Some people take her for granted
Some people want to steal her heart
Yeah, some people want to steal her heart
And she don't even know
How could that be so?<start>Thought it was dead and buried
Then it woke you up last night
You sounded so damn worried
You've been tossing, turning, both ends burning
I wanna put your mind at ease again
(Make everything alright)
I know it's getting underneath your skin
I've tried to tell you now
Don't look over your shoulder
'Cause that's just the ghost of me
You're seeing in your dreams
Wait, there's no rhyme or reason
Sometimes there's no meaning
In the visions when you're sleepin'
Don't wake up and believe them
You're looking at the ghost of me
You're looking at the ghost of me
With your imagination and emotions running wild
Fueling my frustrations like a fire burning, clock keeps turning
And I, I know it's getting underneath your skin
I've tried to tell you now
Don't look over your shoulder
'Cause that's just the ghost of me
You're seeing in your dreams
Wait, there's no rhyme or reason
Sometimes there's no meaning
In the visions when you're sleepin'
Don't wake up and believe them
You're looking at the ghost of me
Whoa
Yeah, you're looking at the ghost of me
Yeah, you're looking at the ghost of me
Don't look over your shoulder
'Cause that's just the ghost of me
You're seein'
Wait, there's no rhyme or reason
Sometimes there's no meaning
In the visions when you're sleepin'
Don't wake up and believe them
Visions when you're sleepin'
Don't wake up and believe them
You're looking at the ghost of me
Yeah, you're looking at the ghost of me
Yeah, you're looking at the ghost of me<start>She said, "Who answered the phone, I don't understand,
I thought you'd be alone tonight?"
I said, "...the girl who lives here,
she said the band could stay if we bought the beer."
She said. "I don't like the sound of that,
tell me what she looks like - thin or fat?"
I said, "Uh... I can't really say.
What does it matter anyway?"
I said, "It's good to hear your voice,
I really do miss you but we made the right choice."
She said, "I hope you're eating well,
and living here without you is living though hell."
I said, "...well I may be home early,
it'll be a few days before I know surely."
"Shirley! Is that her name?
Is she in love, and do you feel the same?"
No I don't feel the same.
I cannot find a way to make peace with you today.
So where will be we tomorrow?
I busted my ass to make it home
and when I got there she wasn't alone.
She said, "You're home so soon!
I didn't get a chance to clean the room."
I said, "...forget this house...
road cheese calls both man and mouse."
She said, "Don't end it this way!
I really did miss you every day... well...
almost every day... in every way.<start>Another rainy day in New York City
Softly sweet, so silently it falls
As crosstown traffic crawls
Memories in my way in New York City
Tender, tough, too tragic to be true
And nothing i can do
City workers cheer
The taxis disappear
Another rainy day in New York City
Another spacey stay in New York city
High up in an overpriced hotel
The view is really swell
Windy, wet and gray in New york City
No one here i really want to see
Old friends and family
So suddenly serene
The air is fresh and clean
Another rainy day in New York City<start>She Still Remembers Tony,
And the lonely night,
He sailed away,
He told her not to worry,
'cause he'd come back to her,
The next day,
And when the tide washes in from the sea,
I know that day,
She will be,
She'll be,
Out there looking for Tony,
Walkin' round calling his name,
She cried,
Tony, she cried,
Tony,
Tony baby,
Tony baby,
Where can you be?
And then she comes back to my arms,
"Help me find Tony dear",
"Baby, Tony's gone",
I don't think I can blame her,
The way she cries for him,
That way,
'Cause if I lost my love,
I know that I would feel the same,
And when her smile disappears to a frown,
I have a feeling,
She won't stay around,
'Cause she goes,
Out there looking for Tony,
Walkin' round calling his name,
She cries,
Tony, she cries,
Tony,
Tony baby,
Tony baby,
Where can you be?
She still remembers Tony,
She still remembers Tony,
She still remembers Tony,
She still remembes Tony...<start>Lucifer is standing on a house of love
Doing all those things I was dreaming of
He's throwing out some with his golden gloves
Well he and I was thinking of a thousand more
Sinners in style, always breathing!
Madame and I now I'm bleeding!
Why else do we love it we still need it
We still love it we still love it yeah!
Lucifer is standing on a house of love
As if I wasn't waiting from worlds above
He's boxing out women with his golden glove
He's clean and he's thinking he's rising up
Sinners in style, always breathing!
Where we loved it now we need it!
Why else do we love it we'll still read it
Why else do we love it why else do I love it, yeah!
Hold on to your feelings
Hold on to your feelings
Hold on to your feelings
Hold on to your feelings
Sinners in style, always breathing!
Where we loved it now we need it!
Why else do we love it we still read it
Why else do we love it why else do we love it
Why else do we love it why else do we love it we still love it we still love it!

Looking for trouble
Everybody likes to fight sometimes
Heading south on 41
Straight for the action
Meeting the boys at the county line
He kicks it into overdrive
Really puts that pedal down
Feels so good to be alive
He's had enough of being pushed around
Bobby and the boys walk in
The heads start turning
They don't like no strangers in this place, no no
Everybody's acting tough
Words get spoken
And someone pulls a knife in Bobby's face, no!
He turns away but it's too late
He's gotta face them on his own
Left him there to meet his fate
Bobby's never going home
Boys cry tough
Boys fight dirty
Life gets rough
When you're living on a fine line
Mary's waiting home tonight
She's dreaming of church bells
Bobby says the day is getting near
Mary hears the doorbell ring
The blue lights are flashing
At 2 A.M. her dreams all disappear
Mary's world is turning upside down
She's been left here on her own
Her world is spinning 'round and 'round
Bobby's never coming home
Boys cry tough
Boys fight dirty
Life gets rough
Yeah, when you're living on a fine line
He said that soon their lives would be as one
Looks like you're gonna be the lonely one
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Maybe in a year or two
She'll find someone of her own
Mary don't you wait around
Bobby's never coming home
Boys cry tough
Boys fight dirty
Life gets rough
When you're living on a fine line
Boys cry tough
Boys fight dirty
Life gets rough
When you're living on a fine line<start>If there's something you want to say then say it now
If there's someone you want to love then love them now
You don't want to miss all this
'Cause it would be the biggest mistake of your life to never try
If there's a song you wanna sing then sing it now
If there's a life you want to live then live it now
'Cause it'll be gone, hold on
Don't you let your second chances get away, don't wait
'Cause now
This is the time we must start living in
Let's make a change while it's not too late
Let's make a place where love is happening
The world is going by
There's no greater time than now
If there's someone who needs a hand then give it now
If there's someone you want to teach then show them how
Just show 'em the light inside
The one that shows us how tomorrow's gonna be
Plant a seed<start>Don't talk to strangers
Keep away from the danger
Don't talk to strangers who smile
Keep away from the danger all the time
You just keep away
Red lights are flashin'
There's been a misunderstandin'
I'm bruised, broke an' bandaged
Through drinkin' all that brandy
I was under the table
But I came back for more
Gotta hit the bottle
But my head hit the floor
[Chorus]
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger, danger, don't you talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger, don't talk keep away
Red lights still flashin'
People all still dancin' in my head
I've done with thinkin' about what to do
Another night of drinkin', just one before I'm through
I was just raisin' hell
I wasn't doin' no harm
The cops could not appreciate
My natural charm
[Chorus]
(Don't talk to strangers)
[Chorus: x2]
Don't you go talkin' to no strangers in this town<start>A faded picture from your heart
Was all you left for me
I'm still waiting, stanging here
To see what i could see
Your love i borrowed just like time
It wasn't mine to keep
But the love we shared
I thought was there
And now you have to leave
Just walk away
There'll be no more tomorrows
Just walk away
You won't be there for me
From far away
I tried to say i'm sorry
But i can't find a way
(to) just walk away
Couldn't see for i was blind
The hurt you hide inside
I didn't mean to break your heart
I wish it had been mine
And as another day unfolds
Don't know what it means
Was it love we had
Or love gone bad
Still the love we need
Just walk away
There'll be no more tomorrows
Just walk away
You won't be there for me
From far away
I tried to say i'm sorry
But i can't find a way
(to) just walk away
I'm still standing, waiting here
Waiting for a sign
I didn't mean to break your heart
I wish it had been mine
Just walk away
There'll be no more tomorrows
Just walk away
You won't be there for me
From far away
I tried to say i'm sorry
But i can't find a way
(to) just walk away
Just walk away
Yeah, walk away
Just walk away...<start>Trade back highs and lows
Within the blink of an eye
Have you ever been burnt so bad?
You swore this would be the last
I never could've escaped it
I didn't wanna be seen
How did it all happen so fast?
The only choice left for me... outlast
Rather be here now more than ever
Feed the doubt
Until you figure how to lock it in
There'll always be the thrill of it
Messed up, pissed off, build on it
'Cause maybe it looks better with a stain on it
Until you figure how to lock it in
There'll always be the thrill of it
I figure if it's possible
We'll find it in this miserable...
I figure if it's possible
We'll find it in this miserable...
It's somewhere in this miserable...
Face the source
When to hold, when to fold
I best not forget.<start>Que bonita la vida

I'd rather go back to the dreams I'm living in my head
Tuesday evening: Pack my bags, I'm heading out the door
I left a box of memories lying on the floor
Ride on, ride till early morning sun
Ride on, like the dawning of the day
It's too late, to let all your feelings show
Go on, til the night is swept away
I'm running from the city lights
I'm running from this empty life
I'm running out of time tonight
I'm screaming out for "Help! Help!"
"Slow down, your moving too fast
Go home, you'll feel better for it
Oh boy, you better stop dreaming
It's all in your head!"
'Cause it's too late now
Ride on, ride till early morning sun
Ride on, like the dawning of the day
It's too late, to let all your feelings show
Go on, til the night is swept away
Ride on, ride till early morning sun
Ride on, like the morning of the day

Ride on, til the night is swept away<start>These walls have eyes
Rows of photographs with faces like mine
Who do we become without knowing where
We started from?

And I stand alone inside your room
Everything that you made by hand
Everything that you know by heart
[Chorus:]
I will try to connect all the pieces you've left
I will carry it on and let you forget
I'll remember the years when your mind was still clear
All the flickering lights that filled up this silent house
One room, two beds
In the closet hangs your favorite dress
Good books that you read
Are in pieces now; the pages are shredded
Everything that you made by hand
Everything that you know by heart
[Chorus]
Everything that you made by hand
And everything that you learned by heart
Every name that you can't recall

I won't fade away

Let the music play<start>I was so tired of being upset
Always wanting something I never could get
Life's an illusion, love is a dream
But I don't know what it is
Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
I was so tired of being upset
Always wanting something I never could get
Life's an illusion, love is a dream
But I don't know what it is
'Cause everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
Life's an illusion, love is the dream
But I don't know what it is
Everyone's saying things to me
But I know it's okay, okay
Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
Life's an illusion, love is a dream
Life's an illusion, love is the dream
Life's the illusion, love is a dream
Life's the illusion, love is the dream
Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays, days
Bet you are tired of being upset
Always wanting something you never can get
Life's no illusion, love's not a dream
Now, I know just what it is
Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays<start>(I hear a song, it makes me think of a girl I used to know...
I sing along when I hear it on the radio now)
Hey now where'd we go?
Yeah days when the rains came
Way down in the hollows
Oooh yeah playing a new game
Laughing and a-running
Hey hey
Skipping and a-jumping
In the misty morning fog
Oh baby, yeah my heart's a-thumping you
My brown eyed girl
(Brown eyed girl...brown eyed girl)
You my
Brown eyed girl
Do you remember when? (do you remember when?)
Yeah we used to sing...
Sha la la la la la
La la la la la la
Sha la la la la la
La la la la la la
(I hear a song, it makes me think of a girl I used to know)
Hey... Hey... Hey
(I sing along when I hear it on the radio now)
Now that the years gone by
Yeah now that I'm on my own
I saw you baby, just the other day
But my baby, you have grown
I cast my memory back there Lord
Sometimes, I am overcome just thinking about it
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium with you
My brown eyed girl
You my
Brown eyed girl
(My brown eyed girl...my brown eyed girl)
You my
Brown eyed girl
(My brown eyed girl...my brown eyed girl)
You my
Brown eyed girl
Do you remember when?
Yeah we used to sing
Sha la la la la la
La la la la la la
Sha la la la la la
La la la la la la
Sha la la la la la
La la la la la la
Sha la la la la la
La la la la la la
I hear a song
It makes me think of a girl
I used to know
HEY...HEY...HEY
I sing along
When I hear it on the radio now
I sing along
When I hear it on the radio
Now<start>On this day where you're so messed it's clear
Can't explain the (world you roam?)
Anyone who's been
As I walk with you, It chills me so
To hear you say "It's come to this"
And the (rats I've killed!)
In a dream, I always talk to you
You seem fine again, my sweet
Feels alright to me
Is it right for you?
Flippin' out I try to call to you
Til' you come to me
Tell me what to do
And I know it's not the same, there's no blame
(Still I bother you)
And you say it's not your deal, it's mine to fear(feel?)
(Follow along, ?)
Come on out(alive?) I know you'll sing with me
I won't sing to you
It's not a thing I do
Has it been a different feel for you?
Wholesomeness was gone along
Is it something new?
And I know it's now the same, there's no blame
(Still I bother you)
And you say it's not true, dear, it's mine to fear
(We won't coexist)(I'm coming through ?)
Any way you're not the same, it's the pain (blame?)
(Follow along, son)(follow through)?<start>What cha wanna be, when you grow up
What cha gonna do, when your time is up
What cha gonna say, when things go wrong
What cha wanna do, when you're on your own
There's a road, long and winding
The lights are blindin', but it gets there
Don't give up, don't look back
There's a silver linin', it's out there somewhere
Everybody wants an answer, everybody needs a friend
We all need a shinin' star on which we can depend
N' so tonight we're gonna wish upon a star
We never wished upon before (to find what you're looking for)
There'll be times, in your life
Ya when you' be dancin' n' shit, but you ain't gettin it
But don't get disillusioned, no, don't expect too much
'Cause if what you have is all you can get just keep on
Tryin', it just ain't happened yet
Everybody wants to be winner, everybody has a dream
We all need a shinin' star when things ain't what they seem
So tonight we're gonna wish upon a star
We never wished upon before (gotta get where you're headed for)
Everybody wants some kindness, everybody needs a break
We all need a shinin' star when things get hard to take
So tonight we're gonna wish upon a star
We never wished upon before<start>Papa he left home today
Said he ain't comin' back again
Said he ain't gonna be nobody's second best
Just cause mama's got a special kind of friend
Papa he left home today
Said he ain't comin' back no more
Said he ain't gonna take no damn back seat and how could mama do him so low
But mama's got a girlfriend now boy
Mama's got a girlfriend
Now mama's got a girlfriend mama's got a true friend
Mama's got a girlfriend now
You see mama don't watch your damn football and your beer drinkin'
Just won't do you're just stayin' out late and you're preachin'
The hate and you never have been true
You see mama she want her
Somebody who will let her be herself
so she's leavin' you and your stinky damn ways cause
She's found somebody else
And mama's got a girlfriend
Now boy mama's got a girlfriend
Now mama's got a girlfriend mama's found a true friend
Mama's got a girlfriend now
Papa he left home today
He was wavin' his hands and cryin'
You could tell by the sound and the tone in his voice that
His heart was slowly dyin'
But mama said "Boy if I ever catch you 'round here again
You ain't never gonna have nobody else not a woman or a man"
And mama's got a girlfriend
Now boy mama's got a girlfriend
Now mama's got a girlfriend mama found a true friend
Mama's got a girlfriend
Now mama's got a girlfriend
Now boy mama's got a girlfriend
Now mama's got a girlfriend
Mama's found a true friend
Mama's got a girlfriend now<start>Some wonder, some filter, some trip to pass the time
Just ask him and he'll tell you nothing better then a desperate mind
I'm in love with a widow soon to be,
I don't think I can fight it
Anthems broke and I'm spinning 'round again,
Stayin' dizzy 'cause I like it
You can have it if you want it,
just remember it's a lonely ride
Ain't that hard to fight
Kickin' hard time, they split you to the bone. Kickin' hard time, risin'
Home is your destination, do you think you can find it
Feelin' green once again, downtown you go, the arrows rising
You can have it if you want it,
just remember it's a lonely ride
Ain't that hard to fight
Kickin' hard time, they split you to the bone. Kickin' hard time, risin'
Some wonder, some filter, some trip to pass the time
Just asked him and he will tell you there is nothing better then a desperate mind
Diablo, talk to me, tell me what's on your mind
That game boy, to the rivals, we don't need no war inside
Kickin' hard time, kickin' hard time, risin'
Once so magnetic but you do it so poetic
And you lay it on the line
And singin' kickin' hard time, it ain't that hard to find
Kickin' hard time, they split you to the bone. Kickin' hard time, risin'<start>You write on bits of paper
A bus that never ends
You know you missed the reason
why she never was your friend
You jump on all the lillies
While dancing to the sun
And the servant wind has stolen
The songs you never sung
The rising tide of milk and honey
Flowing round and round
Light of day and dark of night
They merge without a sound
Take a look behind you at things you'd never see
It's not that time is running out, it's just the sand between
Innocence betrayed you, of that you know you're sure
Snow White has tumbled from your dreams again
Inventor of a multitude of things that never see the light
Of day or is it night you're not so very sure
Look to this marvel mirror, you can't believe it when
They say you've aged a decade in your last few years<start>Nothing that's forced can ever be right
If it doesn't come naturally, leave it
That's what she said as she turned out the light
And we bent our backs as slaves of the night
Then she lowered her guard and showed me the scars
She got from trying to fight
Saying oh, you'd better believe it.
Well I'm up to my neck in the crumbling wreckage
Of all that I wanted from life
When I looked for respect all I got was neglect
Though I swallowed the lign as a sign of the times
But dealing a jack from the back of the pack
They said-"You lose again"
Oh, I said, who needs it?
Well don't get me wrong now I tried to get on
With the jokers that got in my way
And I put on a smile and I tried all the while to be straight
But they just wanted more all the time and I'm sure
That you know what I mean when I say
That I'm sick of the touch and there's only so much you can take.
Well nothing that's real is ever for free
And you just have to pay for it sometime
She said it before, she said it to me
I suppose she believed there was nothing to see
But the same old four imaginary walls
She built for living inside
I said oh, you just can't meana it
Well there was never a doubt that she had to get out
she was just looking around for a way
In the pit of the night there was nowhere to hide any more
She was out on a limb, she was reaching for things
That she wanted, but just couldn't say
And she had to be sure that she wouldn't get caught like before.
Well nothing that's forced can ever be right
If it doesn't come naturally, leave it
That's what she said as she turned out the light
And she may have been wrong, and she may have been right
But I woke with the frost, and noticed she'd lost
The veil that covered her eyes
I said oh, you can leave it.<start>In the light of this sombre park
Your bloomy night and freckles stunned
Leave the dirt all upon this town
Cuz i'm so down,the lover's pawn
Call me again from the land of mud
You've got me now , you've got me now
Though the tales that you've made it up
All in dressing room ,always fine<start>As children we're drawn to gold
And wonders of stories told
How riches are earned
Lessons are learned
And all ends well
And life is that simple game
When loves finally comes our way
And if we're naive
We can't help believe
We'll conquer it all
We've found the strongest love
And hope is in our eyes
Let's not take it for granted
All that we're feelin' tonight
When bands of gold and diamonds
Finally lose their shine
And all the stars and glitter fade away
There's no way to measure
The chance it could last forever
But it's ours right now to treasure
On the way
Tonight all the streets are lined
In moonlight and silver twine
If we make a wish
There's no telling if
It's gonna survive
'Cause even the strongest love
Needs a little help along the way
Let's not take it for granted
By letting it all slip away
When bands of gold and diamonds
Finally lose their shine
And all the stars and glitter fade away
There's no way to measure
The chance it could last forever
But it's ours right now to treasure
And I do treasure you
Yes I do<start>Well, everything's so different now
This scream which fills the air
And haunts the hall which children
Sleep upon the floor
They'll have the gun, you'll hear them say
With smiles meant to cry
As they wind the watch strapped on the wrist
And quickly look away
And four and six have come and gone
Five times before this scene
And upon the lips of everyone
The curse I've never dreamed
Yeah, upon the lips of everyone
The curse I've never dreamed
It's a complicated situation
It's a complicated situation, mama
I'm a complicated situation
The young must be our sacrifice
They say with crippled grins
The eyes of youth must lose their way
And stumble here within
So the sleeping children were awoke
In time to haze their eyes
So it's never known on which they chokes
Worth books of old and time
So it's never known on which they chokes
Worth books of old and time
It's a complicated situation
It's a complicated situation, mama
I'm a complicated situation<start>You were right all along
You know I hate that, admitting I was wrong
So I don't answer the phone when it's you
It's funny when I see the caller I.D.
That shows the phone line's
Still in your dad's name
So hey, I'm doing okay
And I'll get back to you
If you come back to me
Your voice is so Marilyn Monroe
It's funny how that makes me wanna smash the phone
I wonder if JFK ever felt this way
All alone, like summer when it snows
So out of place, so out of those fake smiles
I used to do so well
And here's the part of the song
Where I start to break down like my broken heart
But it's not gonna matter
The lines are all down from a hurricane
They should have named after you
Maybe I should get a Scorpions ring tone
To remind me of you
But hey, I'm doing okay
And I'll get back to you
If you come back to me
Oh, here we go
Just like a broken record skipping apart
That we both oughta know by heart
We were right there and now it seems so tragic
No happy ending, now this whole thing seems so drastic
You asked me 20 times where we could find our magic
Ask David Copperfield or even Ric Ocasek
David Blaine, where's the magic?
Lance Burton, where's the magic?
Harry Potter, where's the magic?
I used to think Pop Rocks were magic
Sigfried and Roy, where's the magic?
Shaquille O'Neal, why'd you leave the magic?
You asked me 20 times or was it 28?
And then your greatest trick ever was your Great Escape
So hey, I'm doing okay
And I'll get back to you
If you come back to me
Oh, here we go
Just like a broken record skipping apart
That we both oughta know by heart
And I can still hear you singing along, yeah<start>(Go)
(Yeea,yea)
(One, two)
All these games you play, you're messin with my head
(You're messin with my head)
And I don't know why I stay I should leave instead
(Should leave instead)
When I speak from my heart you laugh like its a game
(Well this ain't no game)
Yea we make great friends but it just isn't the same
And I know this is not the way it should be
And I know you treat him like me
(Bedu, bedu, bedu, bedu)
But I don't
I wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
No I don't need you to buy me pretty things
(You don't pay for me)
Pay for my tattoos or buy me diamond rings
(We don't want those things)
But all I know is that I'm happy to see you smile
(Wanna see you smile)
And it make my day if you would just stay for awhile
(Won't you stay with me?)
And I know this is not the way it should be
And I know you treat him like me
(Bedu, bedu, bedu, bedu)
But I don't
I wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
This gone on for way too long
And I'm tired of moving on
This gone on for way too long
This gone on for way too long
And I'm tired of movin on
This gone on for way too long
And I know this is not the way it should be
And I know you treat him like me
(Bedu, bedu, bedu, bedu)
But I don't
Wanna stop<start>Won't you please tell me I'm looking for my imaginary friend
But I can't remember where I last saw him
I don't want to loose him why don't you understand
And I need to hear whichever ???
You say I'm acting strange
I don't know why
And if I've been that way
I don't try
I know you don't believe me
But I don't want to lie
And if you see him, please, don't scare him away
If I had another chance to see my imaginary friend
'Cause my memories of him begin to dim
Don't mind if he tells me everything I should do
And I'll do what I can to see it through<start>As the sun sinks
Life closes tired eyes
As hello turns its back and
It greets goodbye
Never wanted to believe
Or have to understand
Time waits for no one
Child, woman or a man
The burdens that gather
The crosses that bare
What's given and taken life the
Ocean to the sand
Never wanted to believe
Or have to understand
Time waits for no one
Child, woman or a man
No final curtain calls
No more storms that rearrange
To hold you in my arms and know
That nothing's ever gonna change
To bend the hands of time
So here we stand and through it all
I love you now and beyond forever
Never wanna believe or have to understand
Time waits for no one
Child, woman or a man
No final curtain calls
No more storms that rearrange
To hold you in my arms and know
That nothing's ever gonna change
To bend the hands of time
So here we stand and through it all
I love you now and beyond forever
Never wanna believe or have to understand
Time waits for no one
Child, woman or a man<start>I feel my days
Are running away like rain
I'm trying to hold on
Even though it's in vain
Off and on
Every day we change
All and all
Love and pain remains
I wish I could exist
Without your love
I wish I wouldn't be
Dependent on
Don't lie to me
To make it all alright
When your eyes
Are telling me good-bye
Don't go
You're all that I have
Don't go
Cause I love you so
Don't go
You're all that I have
Don't go
Cause I love you more than you know
Don't go
I know the way you feel
Won't stay the same
I wish that I could rise
Above the pain
On an on
I'll take it day by day
All and all
I'll make it through the rain
Don't go
You're all that I have
Don't go
Cause I love you so
Don't go
You're all that I have
Don't go
Cause I love you more than you know
You're breaking my heart
Don't go
You tear me apart
Don't go
You 're all that I have
Don't go
Cause I love you more than you know
When you look into my eyes
Can you see the fear I'm holding back
I don't want to let it out cause this
Fear is keeping me on track
I just got to let you know
I don't want to see you go away
I won't change
Love and pain remains
Repeal chorus<start>The memories still hold us together
No matter if we're young or old
As long as there's music we'll all live forever
In the spirit of rock and roll
Once it's in your blood
You won't be the same no more
Reaching every land
From l.a. to tokyo
It's in the heart of every boy and girl
Everywhere all around the world
The spirit (the spirit) the spirit (the spirit)
The spirit of rock n roll
The spirit (the spirit) the spirit (the spirit)
The spirit of rock n roll
You know chuck, buddy, and elvis paved the road
The roots are deep inside us
It's the rythm in our soul
Now it's the heart that's behind the beat
The only sound that is complete
The spirit (the spirit) the spirit (the spirit)
The spirit of rock n roll
The spirit (the spirit) the spirit (the spirit)
The spirit of rock n roll
Can you hear it
Rockin' to the beachy type the spirit
The spirit the spirit
It's in the heart of every boy and girl
Everywhere around the world
The spirit (the spirit) the spirit (the spirit)
The spirit of rock n roll
The spirit (the spirit) the spirit (the spirit)
The spirit of rock n roll
The spirit (the spirit) the spirit (the spirit)

The spirit of rock n roll
The spirit (the spirit) the spirit (the spirit)
The spirit of rock n roll
The spirit (the spirit) the spirit (the spirit)
The spirit of rock n roll<start>Floating, in circles
Changes, Coming as we die
Silence, broken by silence
Further, here goes
Sitting in my boat, watching the sun, it smiles
Need to fix the chaos, make a mess
I need to taste some iron, and get it played
I like to eat that woman in the purple dress
Screw things up a bit and get myself...
It's a waste of time, just go fishing
A waste of these seconds we've got
Swimming, sleeping, enjoy a paradise
In sunset, by an hour, a finger will blow it all away
Need to fix the chaos, make a mess
I need to taste some iron and get it made
I'd like to eat that woman in the purple dress
Screw things up a bit and get myself (p)layed
Yeah....<start>Prairie days have gone away leaving us in disarray
Fancy cars and credit cards have taken the world
The world by large, Sad but true the only view of
the world is not so true, is not so true
Would you believe it if you saw it or would you take
it for what it is
When I see the sun I see a solar-centered symphony
rising on creation found by only one, It's not hard to see
that we could be the ones to make the world believe
We are so far we need the world to cater to our every need
Generation to generation conversations about the right
Religion but desperate are we that we try to seek
everything but peace and restoration
We've got a purpose, it's all around us but Hollywood
Has got their opinions
When I see the sun I see a solar-centered symphony
rising on creation found by only one, It's not hard to see
that we could be the ones to make the world believe
we are so far we need the world to cater to our every need
So get up, get up, get up, get up and get out
(Out of the box give it up, you've got to give it up)
Get up, get up, get up, get up and get out
(Out of the box give it up, you've got to give it up)
When I see the sun I see a solar-centered symphony
Rising on...<start>Somewhere in the distance,
Was a place you can't describe,
All people lived in anger,
They thought it wasn't right, they called it tragedy
All fools, they disappeared,
They were lost and never seen,
Sometimes you hear the screams
Of the souls of the undead in the midnight hour
Don't walk alone,
Hide your skin and your bones,
Beware of all dark in the night
It's magic,
It's magic,
Burning symbols on the wall,
It's magic,
They searched for you, they search for all
Living for today,
'cause tomorrow never comes,
Oh lord, they have to pray,
That no evil's coming out of the rotten swamp
At the houses of the holy,
They tried to break the walls,
Their whispered dream to turn the key, an evil laugh
And they knew, they will be restrained<start>Please, Mom
You ground me all the time
I know that I was right
All along
And I'm hoping
Remember I'm a kid
I know not what I did
Just having fun
You couldn't wait for something new
And yesterday I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through
Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before
Shit, Dad
Please don't kick my ass
I know I've seen you trashed
At least one time
Can I blame it
On one of my dumb friends?
It's been awhile
Since I have used that line
You couldn't wait for something new
And yesterday I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through
Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before
Alright!
Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before<start>[Instrumental]<start>I toe the line of self-indulgence
Every time I place my pen
Upon the page and form the words
I felt but couldn't show 'til then
And to myself I beg the question
Why do I thus masquerade
As one to one and to another
Someone else? If I, afraid
Of what the consequence of stating
Openly my cause might be,
When I rant and rhyme and reason
Do I write for them or me?
I believe there is some merit
In creating for one's self
But why place before the public
What is best left on the shelf?
Though while I write I do not feel that
What I pen is mine alone,
Even this could be misguided
As are many I have known
Who swore, poor souls, that they possessed
The key to man's mysterious fate,
Succeeded in convincing some,
But most could tell they did but prate
On subjects touching something vague
Which cannot be unproven, or,
In place of content, speak in tongues
Yet know not whom they're speaking for.
No, I am not deluded so;
I do not feel I represent
Some force divine, but still I know
That I shall never be content
To hold my tongue when I would speak
Or change my words to suit the hour
Or pinch a blush upon my cheek
To feign my joy at love gone sour.
I do not wish to disappoint
The faith that others place in me
To lead the way to brighter days,
But sometimes dark is all I see.
I work for good, I toil for hope,
No one can question my intent
But even those who listen close
Can often mistake what I meant.
My fear, I've come to realize,
Is mainly this: that I am wrong,
That my perception is askew,
That I write shyte and call it song.
Perhaps I'll always question thus,
Discount my merits, thoughts, and deeds
'Tis well, long as I still go forth
And see where this, my vision, leads.
Strong is she who knows her mind
And speaks it though she may not please.
Fortunate the audience
That hears such honest thoughts as these.<start>These thoughts are old
Let's keep it cold
Dry lines on me
Dry history
Dryology
That stupid sound
That awful feel
Don't bring them down
And it never will
No it never will
No it never will
No it never will
Hard to believe
That after all this time
That after all this I'm
Still me
No one wants to hear
What you dreamt about unless you dreamt about them
Don't let that stop you
Tell them anyway
And you can make it up as you go
I'm already gone now
You were outside just waiting
I'm already nothing
You just noticed me fading
It takes a lot to make me crazy
And a lot is always going on<start>It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
The world is spinning too fast
And I'm buying Nike shoes
To keep myself tethered
To the days I tried to lose
My mamma said to slow down
You must make your own shoes
And stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood
Keepin' my groove on
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose

Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
There's a monkey in the jungle
Watching a vapor trail
Caught up in the conflict
Between his brain and his tail
And if time's elimination
Then we've got nothing to lose
Please repeat the message
It's the music that we choose
Keepin' my groove on
It's the music that we choose

With your feet up on the dashboard
Rain it kept a steady beat
As I watch you dream of Houston
How you're never going back
Yes sir that's a fact
As you wave your cowboy hat
And sang the Yellow Rose of Texas
Just trying to make high ground
Has kept us on the run
There's no crime in toeing the line
Because vultures aren't on us baby
And we're gonna walk in the sun
I might dream about Houston
But Houston don't dream about me
If I can keep it between the lines
Who knows what will be
Loose change days and motel nights
Day old coffee dollar post cards
State troopers flashing lights
As we listen to the thunder
As we talked about our past
So we see our coming future
You tell me you know love can last
While staring out the window
Just lookin' for
A place to hide
A place to ease our minds
A place away from yesterday
Close to tomorrow
Away from the sorrows
Of living other people's time
I might dream about Houston
But Houston don't dream about me
If I can keep it between the lines
Who knows what will be
How long, how long
Til we feel a change
How long, how long
Will the skies be gray
How long, how long
Will it be this way
How long, how long
Will she stay?
I might dream about Houston
But Houston don't dream about me
If I can keep it between the lines
Who knows what will be
I might dream about Houston
But Houston don't dream about me
If I can keep it between the lines
Who knows what
Who knows what
Who knows what will be<start>I've travelled all around the world and the
Loneliest place is where you are
I don't miss you much at all;
Somehow the pain of losing you has let me go
That empty space you left has grown roses
Out of shit and one thing's for sure
I don't need your love
How are you? Where have you been?
I couldn't care less; do you know what I mean?
Unrequited squandered love; I'm just another face upon the wall of failed
Dude, I don't wanna talk, because all the words you say only hurt
I don't need your love<start>Oh Elaine, you've broken my dreams
It's not as it seemed before
I can see, it don't mean to you
What it could mean to me
Been a long time, as the road winds
I'm sideways in a great haze
I turn, turn the page
Oh Elaine, I'm going insane
It's cold and the rain won't do
I'm told, I must make this turn
I guess, it won't be with you
Been a long time, as the road winds
I'm sideways in a great haze
I turn, turn the page<start>I heard a rumor and it's hard to ignore
everybody is saying punk's not cool anymore
So I called all my friends just to make sure
then I went down to the record store
Took all my CDs of Rancid and traded them in for the new Rancid album
Shaved off my Mohawk,
I got a bald head and a tattoo that says "I'll skank till I'm dead".
No one likes the punks these days
LET'S GO SKA! WE CAN START TODAY!
Politics Schmolitics, we can get some food
and we can write songs about being rude
I got a porkpie, a bad attitude, a checkerboard tie and a three-piece suit
I'm glad that I found this sound
And I hope there's cheap tattoo removal when this trend dies down
I wanna be cool the Rastafarian way
LET'S GO SKA! HEP HEP HEP HEY!<start>Don't wanna calm down
And I'm not gonna wise up

Now all we need is a little singing
And it's gotta be great 'coz it ruins my ear
When the guitar wall is ringing
Hey, we've been circling the airport
To give what we've got; and still some
To small to be seen and to big to control
And treated like a walkin' bomb
To doom-de-doomsday
Even if we start today
We'll be big in L.A.

Rock'n'rock radar can't pick you up
A stain on the screen is all they'll see
Ass in trouble, someone broke a string
But who cares, we have an aeroplane, yeah
It takes more than a budget to keep us away
It's the bound to entertain, ya, mania
With international niceness
On recycled vinyl and tape
Yeah, with a new rage, we'll find backstage
And press our bellybuttons and escape
To doom-de-doomsday

You gotta get home, get on your way.
That kinda sucks, wish you could stay.
But, yeah, I get it, you're just not ready.
You say, "baby steps" and I keep waiting, yup,
I'm not complaining.
I know you'll be worth it, I'm tossing and turning.
I lay down,
You're the first thing that pops in my mind,
I'm stuck on you.
You're all around,
I can still see you with the lights out, lights out.
'Cause I can't sleep tonight.
When I can't sleep, it's like I'm dreaming.
'Cause I can't sleep tonight.
No, I can't sleep and you're the reason.
So, when I stay awake, know it's from you.
I've been running all day, it's no use.
Because I can't sleep tonight.
So, tell me can you sleep?
Tell me can you sleep, tonight?
Back in class, we'd yap it up.
I saw you everyday, wasn't enough,
And after lunch, we'd take the top down.
I go to touch, you put your guard down.
Each time I take a step.
It just gets better, yet, you drive me crazy.
I know you'll be worth it, I'm tossing and turning.

Than we had planned
Capital from boy, woman and man
We were like ink and paper
Numbers on a calculator
Knew arithmetic so well
Working overtime
Completed what was assigned
We had to multiply ourselves
A bouncing little baby
A shiny copper penny
And he spent himself
Would not listen to us
But when he lost his appetite
He lost his weight in friends
Baby became a fat nickel so fast
Then came puberty, exponentially
Soon our boy became a million
People loved him so
And helped him to grow
Everyone knew the
Thing that was best
Of course, he must invest
A penny won't do, no (x4)
And he made us proud
He made us rich
And how were we to know
He's counterfeit
Now everything's ruined, yeah (x8)<start>We stood. In an empty house.
With bottles in our hands against the wall
On the last night of the year,
the lights slowly started to fall
And you say, "this could happen for a reason"
How can you not have any faith
The beauty that surrounds us
it didnt happen by mistake
In the heart of the city
Good hearts will break
Is this a test to see
How much we can take
You say you say that theres an explanation
Oh, but its hard to see
I look to find salvation
In something more concrete
Because if, for the final destination
Is there either way
But should I receive an invitation
When it calls my name
In the heart of the city
Good hearts will break
Is this a test to see
How much we can take
In the heart of the city
My heart will break
Is this a test to see
How much I can take
In the heart of the city
Good hearts will break
Is this a test to see
How much we can take<start>When you look to the future
Don't forget to write to me
When you last fail to wonder
Don't regret I broke the seam
'Cause the night is so serene just add kerosene
We always felt so good together
The days just rolled on by
Moon and sun, we all move on
The nights in the sand dunes
Carefree days and summer sounds
It's the way we built you
That house just won't come down
My faults, my feeble ways, my better days
We tried to hide from failure, the weather
We said we'd never fight
Moon and sun, what's done is done
Moon and sun, we all move on
Did you say someday?
Did you say you try?
Did you say you love me?
Don't ask why
'Cause we always felt so good together
But the days just rolled on by
Moon and sun, we all move on
We all move on, we all move on, we all move on<start>I believe, that there's something deep inside
That shouldn't be from time to time.
I sure found out, for love was such a crime.
The more you care, the more you fall.
No need to worry, no need to turn away
Cause it don't matter, anyway, baby
Oooh, I miss you in a heartbeat.
Oooh, I miss you right away.
Oooh, I miss you in a heartbeat.
It ain't love, if it don't feel that way.
Oh, no.
When we touch, I just lose my self control,
A sad sensation I can't hide.
To love is easy, it ain't easy to walk away.
I keep the faith and there's a reason why.
Yeah.
No need to worry, no need to turn away
Cause it don't matter, anyway, baby
Oooh, I miss you in a heartbeat.
Oooh, I miss you right away.
Oooh, I miss you in a heartbeat.
It ain't love, if it don't feel that way.
Oh, no.
Now, I ain't big on promises, I'll be true to you.
I'll do 'bout anything, yeah,
For some one like, baby for you.
(Oooh)
I miss you in a heartbeat.
(Oooh)
Yeah, I'd miss you right away.
(Oooh)
Oh, miss you in a heartbeat.

Antifa -
Ihr knnt mich mal
Ich lache ber euch
Und ihr merkt es nicht mal.
Ihr kmpft gegen mich
Wie lcherlich
Denn euren wahren Feind
Den seht ihr nicht.
Ihr denunziert
Ihr seid schlecht informiert
Moralisch bankrott
Da ihr das nicht kapiert.
Ihr seid blinder als blind
Pseudomoralisten
Dumm und intrigant
Nicht besser als Faschisten.
(Chor)
Ohne mich
Mich kriegt ihr nicht
Ich bin frei wie der Wind
Kapiert ihr das nicht
Ohne mich
Mich kriegt ihr nicht
Ich hab' das dritte Auge
Seht ihr das nicht.
Und hier ein paar Worte
An die -rechte- Adresse
Leckt uns am Arsch
Sonst gibt's auf die Fresse.
Ich hasse euch
Und eure blinden Parolen
Fickt euch ins Knie
Euch soll der Teufel holen.
Ihr seid dumm geboren
Genau wie ich
Doch was ich lernte
Lernt ihr nicht!
Ihr seid blind vor Hass
Dumm wie Brot
Ihr habt verschissen
Eure Fhrer sind tot!

Unless they try to play it too darn fast.
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that
Rock and roll music
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she can hear man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man
They were goin' like a hurrican'
That's why I go for that
Rock and roll music
'Way down south they grave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' homebrew from a water cup
The folks dancin' got all shook up
And started playin' that
Rock and roll music
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to hear a mambo
It's 'way too early for a congo
So keep a-rockin' that piano

Well kids it's been a really fun show, and I want you all to know that we'll come back soon, but before I go I want to say I think Tom is extemely good looking and all the girls out there should think he's good looking. Tom has one of the best butts that I've ever seen, shimi shimi coco puff shimi shimi right shimi shimi coco puff. Does anybody here want to sleep with me. I'm really a nice guy, it's really not Satan...
It's me it's not Satan let's all be happy he's not here say fuck Satan
Alright I'm out of jokes and out of songs, I think we're done.<start>Taking all what others have hassled
Looking back to darker days getting me down
And if this is chaos
I think that I'm in love with clamor
Tides are turning
never understood my undeveloped story
But it makes sense to me, you make sense to me
When it all falls down, I'll still be right here
When it all falls down, we'll still be right here
Once in a lifetime, I could feel this way
Once in a lifetime, you could feel it too
Cancel your black subscription
I'm nowhere near a cigarette
And I'm cut clear as you wander
Past this lonely street and wonder
Dance all night, dance all night
The kids are all here, and we're downtown
We're past the morning glory
It's ten past two
And I'm still working on forty<start>Well, shake it up baby now
Twist and shout
Come on, come on, come, come on baby now
Come on and work it on out
Well work it on out, honey
You know you look so good
You know you got me goin' now
Just like I know you would
Well, shake it up baby now
Twist and shout
Come on, come on, come, come on baby now
Come on and work it on out
You know you twist, little girl
You know you twist so fine
Come on and twist a little closer now
And let me know that you're mine, woo
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah, shake it up baby now
Twist and shout
Come on, come on, come, come on baby now
Come on and work it on out
You know you twist, little girl
You know you twist so fine
Come on and twist a little closer now
And let me know that you're mine
Well shake it, shake it, shake it, baby now
Well shake it, shake it, shake it, baby now
Well shake it, shake it, shake it, baby now
Ah, ah, ah, ah<start>On the outside
things look easy
But on the inside
things ain't right
I've been drinking
to try to free me
Too much thinking
blocks out the light
Oh I've been alone
On this road
For too long
I got lost there's somewhere else I should be
No more hiding
Darkness rising
Shadows are dancing
On their own
In the morning
Embers burning
Spread your wings
This bird has flown
Got my eyes wide
I'm back on my feet
No more hard times
They're out of sight
No more troubles
Why worry?
I know it's gonna be alright
Oh I was alone
On that road
For too long
Always knew there's somewhere else I should be
No more hiding
Darkness rising
Shadows are dancing
On their own
In the morning
Embers burning
Spread your wings
This bird has flown
Up and away
To a better place
I'm not going back yeah
No more hiding
Darkness rising
Shadows are dancing
On their own
In the morning
Embers burning
Spread your wings
This bird has flown<start>I woke up on a cement floor this mornin',
My head felt like somebody been walkin' on it,
Don't know how I got here,
Don't remember nothin' at all,
but if I done all the things that they say I did,
well I sure musta had a ball
'Cause in 30 more days
I'm goin' back home,
To see that gal of mine,
But the Wichita Jail
Is a long long way
From the Tupelo County line,
I gotta do my time
Well I ain't got a cent of the money I had
I spent it
Shirts tore, my shoes got a big hole in it,
There's a king size knot on the side of my head
And I got one big black eye
But brother if you think I look bad,
You oughtta see that other guy
'Cause in 30 more days
I'm goin' back home,
To see that gal of mine,
But the Wichita Jail
Is a long long way
From the Tupelo County line,
I gotta do my time
Well this nine pound hammer feels like it weighs a ton
Makin lil' ones outta big ones in this red hot Kansas sun
I just hope I can make it 30 more days
And get out of this mess I'm in,
And if I ever get back to Mississippi
I ain't ever gonna leave again
'Cause in 30 more days
I'm goin' back home,
To see that gal of mine,
But the Wichita Jail
Is a long long way
From the Tupelo County line,
I gotta do my time
I gotta do my time
I gotta do my time
I gotta do my time<start>I've heard that voice before somehow, I can't imagine
It speaks words without knowing what they mean
I've seen that face before somewhere, I can't remember
It seems as if it happened in a dream
I laughed and now you know
That some things never change
I laughed again because to me you seem
So strange
I know, I never should expect to finish something
I know will never be complete
I feel as if I'm lost again, I'm not, I'm only dreaming
In a world where sound and silence seem to meet
I block out all the noise
A silent song remains
I know it's only music but it sounds
So strange
How does it feel to speak the words
And sing the song?
So strange
So strange
So strange
So strange<start>Well I'm so lonely that I really think that I could
Lay down and take a deep breath and die.
But instead I cry myself to sleep and think as I do,
"Zach, kiss your sweet ass goodbye."
When everything was going beautiful
and nothing stood in my way
I had to go along and throw that all away
and when the people tell me,
"Zach, kid, you better get your shit together"
and I wonder if I will I don't think that I'll ever.
(chorus)
na na na na oh yeah, you're so bad
Zach, you're such a fucking bonehead, kid
You get what you deserve and I'm glad
Sometimes I really wanna pack a bag and get out of town
because I finally felt the feeling to be free.
I want a big city life and a big city girl
and I'd like to take all of my friends with me.
It's these big-shot, insecure people we have
Who we give a right to hold a gun and a badge.
Tell me what to do and I'll tell you right back,
So sick and fucking tired of always picking up your slack.
(chorus)
Don't tell me what to do I'm gonna walk right over you
Cause I'm so lonely that I really wish that I could lay down
and take a deep breath and die
But instead I cry myself to sleep and think as I do
"Zach, kiss your sweet ass goodbye."
When everything was going beautiful and nothing stood in my way
I had to go along now and throw that all away.
And when the people tell me "Zach, kid, you better get your shit together"
and I wonder if I will, I don't think that I'll ever.
(chorus)<start>When I wake up on fire
and get caught in the sheets,
my dreams of safety hit the floor.
I've heard the air raid too many times before
to be bothered by the bombs.
And you ask me why I'm holding on
to what you're holding over my head.
Well I am lost in the space you left between good and bye.
And the butterflies
get caught in my throat
when they try to follow you away from me.
I believe in healing
but there is just no prize
for whose head gets stuck the deepest in the sand.
I believe in healing!
Then Christ,
just heal me!
Don't even try to fix this with that face you make.
I know just how you pout
like a rainy day without a parade.<start>I think I saw a place in the distance
We've always known it was there
When I have breathed for the last time
I'll walk out to the end of that pier
There is that place in our conscience
So talk so loud so you won't hear and forget
But I'll still call it home
But I'll still call it home
Where the sun never dies
Shine away my shadow
Where it's bright when I shut my eyes
I'll drink until I'm not thirsty
The sun never dies
Shine away my shadow
It's just waiting to rise
I'll see you on that day
When I walk those last steps your way
There's something moving in the shadows
There is that rumor of hope
When the spirit starts roaring
For long we have but no longer will we cope
Love is personified
I'd rather die in love
Than stay alive numb
'Cause I'll still call it
I'm still longing home
Where the sun never dies
Shine away my shadow
Where it's bright when I shut my eyes
I'll drink until I'm not thirsty
The sun never dies
Shine away my shadow
It's just waiting to rise
I'll see you on that day
When I walk those last steps your way
Where the sun never dies
Shine away my shadow
Where it's bright when I shut my eyes
I'll drink until I'm not thirsty
The sun never dies
Shine away my shadow
It's just waiting to rise
I'll see you on that day
When I walk those last steps your way
I'll see you on that day
When I walk those last steps your way<start>It will take a fancy store
For mom and dad
To forget what they never had
It will only take one moment
To make her believe
She's something worth trying on
A little motivation goes a long way down
Down
Down
I think a cigarette should smoke
Like the Devil's Holy joke
Because he's laid one out on me
I think if everybody streamed
From their TV's to your scene
It would be okay with me
You can't keep a good thing on a string
You've got to give it room to breath
It may leave an empty space
A little motivation goes a long way down
Down
Down
In every situation,
Heavy traffic
Jams his sound.<start>And how does it feel to be the name that's on the page
To know that you joined the ranks
Of all of the people I hate
And how does it feel to be the one that's center stage
To know that you're just a phase
That started this horrible game
I hear you saying that it hurts so much
You never really thought it through
I'm trying new things and you know this was for you
Well this is my song (thanks for nothing)
And these are my hopes
And that was my world
And that was my girl, and she was the best one
And you were a friend, to the point of a brother
And we had a dream that we would build on each other
The moment was gone
And that was my girl, and she was the best one in the world
And how does it feel to know that you live your life afraid
To know that you choke on shame
For all of the lies that you'll say
How it's up to the kids, let's all hearing it repeat
Let's go back to the nights of shame
Just how many tricks that it took for you to forgive me
And I hear you saying that it hurts so much
You never really thought it through
I'm tying nooses that you know this one's for you
Well this is my song (thanks for nothing)
And these are my hopes
And that was my world
And that was my girl, and she was the best one
And you were a friend, to the point of a brother
And we had a dream that we would build on each other
And that was my girl, and she was the best one
In the world
The world, oh my God, in the world
I hear you saying that it hurts so much
You never really thought it through
I'm tying nooses that you know this one's for you
And this is my song, thanks for nothing
And these are my hopes, hope it gave you something
And that was my world, thank God I forgot it
And that was my girl and she was the best one
You were a friend to the point of a brother
And we had a dream, we would build on each other
And that was my girl, she was the best one in the world<start>Up in the San Francisco where the forest meets the bridge
I thought I saw you standing there and them you fell onto the rails
But that was many years ago and I am so much older now
My brother is a soldier now
I can't see the many how, I moved up in the wind
And you swimming up tide or just to the hand radio stations
I left my love in San Francisco
That's okay, I was bored anyway
I left my love in the room
That's okay, I was born in L.A.
I left my love in San Francisco
That's okay, I was bored anyway
I left my love in a field
That's okay, I was born in L.A.
And we're restricting on this field
That Jesus came from Israel
Isaac followed the sacred cow
So not to wake up, sparrow splashing mud
But that was many years from now
And I hope from here on now
I always seemed to want to shout
Your eyes are like a cup of tea and sending into the sun with me
You swimming upstream or just tuning into new sensations
I was broken and we're broken
I left my love in San Francisco
That's okay, I was bored anyway
I left my love in the room
That's okay, I was born in L.A.
I left my love in San Francisco
That's okay, I was bored anyway
I left my love in a field
That's okay, I was born in L.A.<start>no one likes us i don't know why we may not be perfect but heaven knows we try<start>Well my time went so quickly, I went lickety-splickly out to my old '55
As I drove away slowly, feeling so holy, God knows, I was feeling alive.
Now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck, freeway cars and trucks,
Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer,
Oh, Lord, let me tell you that the feeling's getting stronger.
And it's six in the morning, gave me no warning; I had to be on my way.
Well there's trucks all a-passing me, and the lights are all flashing,
I'm on my way home from your place.
And now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck, freeway cars and trucks,
Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer,
Oh, Lord, let me tell you that the feeling's getting stronger.
And my time went so quickly, I went lickety-splickly out to my old '55
As I pulled away slowly, feeling so holy, God knows, I was feeling alive.
Now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck,
Freeway cars and trucks, freeway cars and trucks, freeway cars and trucks<start>Why do you hate me?
Why don't you just simmer down?
You could be doing great things
Instead of just pushing me around
Or maybe just be sleeping
Even you at times must get tired
You're such a wire
You're such a wire look at you
You're such a wire look at you packing it blasting it
You're such a wire
The world it looks so big but it feels so small
I'm snapping like a twig in this dried up dying fall
I think the winter is gonna be a real whirligig
Why do I hate you?
That's because I am full of it
If all your dreams came ture then you must be completely full of it
You won't catch me weeping 'cause you know that I'm not a crier
I'm such a wire
I'm such a wire look at me
I'm such a wire look at me packing it blasting it
I'm such a wire<start>I'm drowning in the shadows, that creep in my mind
And it's hard to escape, when there's no place left for me to hide
And I keep on running from the blood on my hands
The battle is won but will it ever end
Who am I to kill a stranger
After all that we've been through
Who am I to kill a stranger
After all that we've been through
Darkness has engulfed all the light in my life
And my thirst to kill has grown stronger over time
And I keep on running from the blood on my hands
The battle is won but will it ever end
Who am I to kill a stranger
After all that we've been through
Who am I to kill a stranger
After all that we've been through
Who am I to kill a stranger
The truth you always knew
Who am I to kill a stranger
After all that we've been through
It's the fever that yearns for the thrill of the kill
And I keep on running from the blood on my hands
The battle is won but will it ever end
Who am I to kill a stranger
After all that we've been through
Who am I to kill a stranger
After all that we've been through
Who am I to kill a stranger
The truth you always knew
Who am I, a little stranger
And now I'm killing you<start>Ive fallen, lower than the depths of misery
I wallow in the sorrow of my own afflictions
Resentment my only release
Lost in a corridor of trees and all while the world is at sleep
An abundance of atrocities through a cascade of my broken dreams
Now hear my soliloquy, its a sombre tale of my dismay
Of how the last tear was cried for romance
Shall the flowers bloom when the earth collides with the sun
And all the fruits of once barren land flourish with splendor
Lost in a corridor of trees and all while the world is at sleep
An abundance of atrocities through a cascade of my broken dreams
Now hear my soliloquy, its a sombre tale of my dismay
Of how the last tear was cried for romance<start>The way it goes, is the way it goes.
I'm all right to go
So go...
...you go.
They took their things and headed for the coast
Denied of all in life they needed most
Loves forgotten child
born into the wild
Come to the coast, come to the coast, come to the coast
come to the coast it will find you...
The fallout from the California glow
Toronto's frozen over this every man should know
I've forgotten now
Won't you show me how?
Come.
So run away, so run away from here.
Just run away, just run away my dear...
'Cause love's forgotten child...
So go into the wild
...Come.
Somebody took me away... something controls me...<start>Blue Spanish eyes
Teardrops are falling from your Spanish eyes
Please, please don't cry
This is just adios and not goodbye
Soon I'll return
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say si, si
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
Blue Spanish eyes
Prettiest eyes in all of Mexico
True Spanish eyes
Please smile at me once more before I go
Soon I'll return
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say "Si, si"
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me<start>just say everything that you need
and I will make it come true
then break the rules that you made
turn me into someone like you
and just like you...
now I'm feeling like a monster
and I feel I'm getting stronger
now I'm feeling like a monster
monster
just stay a little longer
so you can show me how to move
and take it further
make me into someone like you
and just like you...

monster<start>Life in 360 degrees
I'm just one of the busy bees
Buzzing in time to the one two threes
Doing heavy lifting that destroyed my knees
Kids today they never say please
But todays angry youth ain't angry enough for me
I'm being all I can be on a working mans salary
I belong in a factory
Maybe one day I'll take a day off or three
and I'll build you a house in a tree
so you can look down as the factory con-
sumed me
In due time you will come to see
there is nothing wrong with you
that's not wrong with me
With everybody here stepping on my beard
it's a wonder that both ends always meet
but we separate the chaff from the wheat
todays middle class is just so bourgeoisie
and I'm picking up my disease
on my working mans salary
I belong in a factory
Maybe one day I'll get my foreman to see
that productivity is going up in the factory be-
cause of me
Once I was led to believe that you'd return
and come back to me
Working the earth and planting our seeds
Growing alfalfa, carrots and peas
Now my heart it just bleeds
and bleeds and bleeds
ever since you felt the need to open your mouth
and sneeze all over my working mans salary
I belong in a factory
Maybe one day when it's under lock and key
We can start a colony
for people who used to be people in the factory
Like me
Let's hear it for the factory
The only thing that understood me truly
Made a factory man out of me
Three cheers for the factory
Go factory<start>Bagheera walked into the bar and poured himself a drink
His fur was stained with the blood of monkeys and he needed time to think
The man at the bar said, "What are you doing here?"
Bagheera let go a low soft purr that kept the man from coming near
He said "I'm Bagheera, the mighty panther and the jungle is my home
I'm free, free in all I see and that makes me free to roam"
Sometimes to feel the music of the jungle it can cause you pain
And the man heard Bagheera as the entire jungle joined in the big black cat's refrain
One dark night the man-cub came to the big black cat afraid
The boy cried, "Teacher, teacher I don't, understand this ache within me"
The great cat sighed and (then softly he began)
He said, "Indeed thou art a man's child now and the world is yours to give and take
The time has come now for your awareness to change forever and there's a choice for you to make
You may remain here in the jungle and hunt with the free people
Or if you feel the man's God calling you return to your kind in the village and worship at his steeple
The only thing you must do is what you feel in your heart is true
I will hunt now and leave you on your own to decide what to do"
The mighty panther went on his hunt
Secret Lord of the jungle beneath the night sky
And some say if you could have seen him then you'd have noticed a single tear fall from his majestic eye<start>Why I should leave:no-why I'm leaving you for him..well, let's see here:well, let's see; where should I begin? Every night you get annihilated with all your friends, and every night I drink alone until you stumble home wanting some- like some fuck and run. I know you sleep around, I see it in the eyes of those girls. Those fucking girls..they smile and nod, but never offer a single word-I'm just in the way-I'm the ball and chain, you're the jailbird chirping, "how hard life is in the cage!"{ how hard it is waking up next to me. Well, you've dug this hole, come on and fill me up. When you said you loved me I knew I was getting fucked you said you'd never let go all that stopped:you used to turn me on, now we're just getting off that's why I'm leaving you. ****and the drunken erratic response from april's ex-boyfriend Trevor Post, upon finding said various notes **** you really, really think this guy is gonna make it all right? You told me you could never be in love with another man oh but this one is it! But I remember when we met we knew that this was the end. Yeah, I remember I remember everything the haircuts the dollar movies. We used to sneak a six pack in your bag, and wait for a girl to scream or a car to crash so we could crack open our cans. Or the time you shaved my head in the front yard; a passerby stopped to take a picture - ended up in the paper and now you want to leave? Well maybe I forgot a couple things it doesn't mean I don't remember how it feels when you're lying naked next to me. Valentine I want to feel your hips pressed up against mine. We'll push into each other-love's alive. It might be fleeting, but it's ours and it's tonight..so won't you reconsider love-lost lives? You might be lonely, but I'm still by your side. You might have to leave but not tonight<start>The nights were dark and long, I spent a million all alone
But I never once stopped loving you
My world was cold and still my dreams lay unfulfilled
But I never once stopped loving you
I never once stopped believing
We'd love again the way we used to do
And today when you came back, my patience was rewarded
For I never once stopped loving you
I could have loved another but I chose to wait and suffer
For I never once stopped loving you
And I prayed to God to guide you 'till I could be beside you
And I never once stopped loving you
I never once stopped believing
We'd love again the way we used to do
And today when you came back, my patience was rewarded
For I never once stopped loving you<start>In an airplane
I take the window seat
A thousand feet
And all I know shrinks in minutes
And when the sky is gray
I want to believe
That when the sun is hiding
It still exists
In an airplane
Are kings and common men
At the window side my side
Their view is now the same
Some relax and rest their eyes
Some sit on the edge
As we all break through the clouds
Into the light of day
Mountaintops peak through
This is where I see you
I've never seen a clearer blue
This is where I see you
Leave behind your busy life
All you have is who you are
Space like this is hard to find
So breathe it in
Someone will say, "Where are you headed?"
And it might be the first time
You ever thought about it
Mountaintops peak through
This is where I see you
I've never seen a clearer blue
This is where I see you
A baby's talking two rows behind me
The sun just set for the second time today
You seem to use the smallest things around me
To get me to this place
Mountaintops peak through
This is where I see you
I've never seen a clearer blue
This is where I see you<start>[Chorus]
Take me to Redneck Heaven
When I'm dead and gone
Where my southern roots are buried
Bandstand still lives on
With some smoky pool room standing
With Jesus on the wall
Take me to Redneck Heaven
When the good Lord comes to call (comes to call, comes to call)
Mother Mary riding proud on the dashboard of my truck
To remind me to count my blessings and to pray for just a little luck
Brother Levi waits for me at the local Seven-Eleven
But just in case I don't make it there
Send me to Redneck Heaven
[Chorus]
There I was on those sawdust streets of gold
And I saw Conway Twitty, and there was Keith Willy
Before I could Hank Williams I turned around and I was face to face
With the king of Rock and roll
You can have your streets of gold
Sawdust will do just fine
And about those singing angels
Just give me Patsy Cline
If I could only meet the king
I'll feel I've rolled a seven
Give me swingin' doors instead of pearly gates
Take me to Redneck Heaven!
[Chorus]
Take me to Redneck Heaven
Hope I see you all<start>Staring at my reflection, seeing the wrongs Ive done
In the face of rejection I should learn to hold my tongue
So Ill toss this robe so clean into the pit that is me
And watch it stain so dark, so dark you cannot see
The white tight underneath, but you try with bloodshot eyes
And youll leave me there to die
My mind fights to grasp this life
While I stumble and trip on the line
Wish a rope would come my way, pull me from this pit of lies
Ive been cheated by the best, shove your lies into my chest
And youll leave me there to die
When youve lost your love for me
As you choke on your lies and steal some breath from me
Remember when death comes to you a new life is waiting for me
You know that your heart is a stone, made to crush the weak and powerless
Everyone you touch, turned to stone
Left alone, never to trust again or find an end
To the hatred deep in their bones
Your heart truly is a stone, that rolls over and over and over my heart
But I wont let you tear me apart
No
I wont let you tear me apart
So Ill learn to walk away
Find myself a brighter day
I know these wounds will heal, but the scars will still remain
So Ill learn to wear them proud
As I leave you behind me now<start>I'd like to think this love will last forever
I believe we'll always be together
But if your heart turns cold
And you ever get the urge to go
Let me be the last to know
(Let me be the last to know)
Let me be the last to know
(Let me be the last to know)
The last to know
You say you love me and I know you do
But if a shade of doubt creeps up on you
Just leave me in the dark
Here with my trusting heart
Let me be the last to know
(Let me be the last to know)
Let me be the last to know
(Let me be the last to know)
The last to know, the last to know
I'd hate to lose you please don't get me wrong
But I'll get the idea when you're gone
Baby, please don't go
Let me be the last to know
(Let me be the last to know)
Let me be the last to know
(Let me be the last to know)
The last to know, the last to know<start>Throw me in the water
'Cause you know that I could never swim
I'll think of you as I go down
And you put yourself in order
'Cause you know that I could never count
As high as you my nose would bleed
And your heart is like a stone
Your flesh has turned to mold
Don't feel bad if hell is not the place you hoped it'll be
And you put aside your dagger
'Cause you know that you might need it soon
To cut me open, feel around inside
And you make like I'm your father
So the blood that spills is all the same
To me and everyone you know
Your heart is like a stone
And your flesh has turned to mold
Don't feel bad if hell is not the place you hoped it'll be
And you say it doesn't matter
'Cause you know from all those books you never read
You knew how they would end<start>Well once I was a slave at the sawmill
Talk about a poor boy talk about a poor boy never saw a dollar bill
My work was so hard at the sawmill
Think about a poor boy think about a poor boy let me have a dollar bill
Well see my teardrops falling down my wife left the sawmill town
She said sawmill life had been a sin the gravy was too thin
And I'd work no more at the sawmill
Mercy of a poor boy mercy a poor boy let me have a dollar bill
And if you bring your wife to the sawmill
How you gonna please her how you gonna please her
When she wants a dollar bill
They're not satisfied at the sawmill
Cause women like a dollar women like a dollar yes and women always will
Oh see my teardrops falling down...
Mercy of a poor boy mercy a poor boy let me have a dollar bill<start>Look at me now
Stare into my eyes
Deep into my soul
The pain I feel
It's stronger than life
It's taken control
My mind is gone
I'm dying inside
I'm falling apart
In agony
I see no way out
The pain's in my heart
It's killing me
God take it away
I just can't go on
I'm suffering
I pray for the end
It's lasting too long<start>Tonight you said that we were through
I've lost again and it is you
I walk alone and think of things,
we've said and done
Our love has flown,
like spring it came and now has gone
Do you remember summer days
Walks on the shore and ?date cafÃ©?
It's winter now, and like the leaves,
these tears are falling for you
I've lost your love,
now I must face this world alone
And soon the night skies turn to dawn
And still my memories linger on
Your world goes on it's true,
but my world stopped when I lost you
Here comes the dawn, my life my love,
now are gone.<start>Freedom for the stallion
Freedom for the mare and her colt
Freedom for the baby child
Who has not grown old enough to vote
Lord, have mercy, what You gonna do
About the people who are praying to You?
They got men making laws that destroy other men
They make money, God, it's a doggone sin
Oh Lord, You got to help us find a way
Big ships sailing
Slaves all chained and bound
Headed for a brand new land
That some cat says he up and found
Lord, have mercy, what You gonna do
About the people who are praying to You?
They got men making laws that destroy other men
To make money, God, it's a doggone sin
Oh Lord, You got to help us find a way, yeah
Freedom for the stallion
Freedom for the mare and her colt
Freedom for the baby child
Who has not grown old enough to vote
Lord, have mercy, what You gonna do
About the people who are praying to You?
You know if I could look inside Your mind
I'd bring back all the truth I find
Oh Lord, You gotta help us find a way
Freedom for the stallion
Freedom for the mare and her colt
Freedom for the baby child
Who has not grown old enough to vote<start>The outro to this song has it's own title, Jack the Stripper
Goin' home, late last night
suddenly I got a fright
Yeah I looked throught the window and surprised what I saw
Fairy boots were dancin' with a dwarf, all right now!
Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes, well all right now!
So I went to the doctor, see what he could give me
he said "Son, son, you've gone too far.
'cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do."<start>(This is a duet, between Lemmy from Motorhead and Kelly from Girlschool, taken from the "Headgirl" EP)
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shaking so much
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shaking so much
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shaking so much
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shaking so much
(Lemmy)
Well there ain't no other woman that can make me feel this way,
Gets up close, you know I just ain't got a word to say.
Please don't touch I shake so much,
Please don't touch I shake so much.
(Kelly)
Well I get so nervous when I see his eyes that shine,
Gets too close and a chill runs down my spine.
Please don't touch I shake so much,
Please don't touch I shake so much.
(Lemmy)
I don't know why she's got her claws in me,
'Cause I ain't fighting baby, can't you see,
(Both)
Sneaking up the stairway, running like a thief,
Spend the night shaking like a leaf,
(Lemmy)
Oh I remember the first time I took her to a cheap motel,
(Kelly)
Well I woke up drunk, you know I felt like Eskimo Nell.
Please don't touch I shake so much,
Please don't touch I shake so much.<start>Did I ask you to call me, darling,
Got no time for a bitter end
I could come around Thursday, maybe,
but I know you're gonna be with your friends
'Cuz every day is like a rooftop catching the sun
and if no one is watching does our love leave any trace
Or just an echo out in space
Yeah...
If you knew what a fool I've been,
You'd strike a match for every day that's been lost
What I wouldn't give to see you make a livin' breaking even
Or just counting the cost
'Cuz every day is like a newborn still as the sun
and if no one is watching does our love leave any trace
Or just an echo out in space
Or just a broke down empty place
Yeah...<start>don't put another thing on my plate
my brain is so full of your face, I ate
I counted the hours since the minute
that I drove by you
and I got a scar where she left me
don't think I'll see her around
come back sunday (come back sunday)
everydays a monday
now that you're gone
come back sunday (come back sunday)
before I got a minute
the minute was gone
think you kinda dug me
but the other guys are up above me
trying to get to you cause I let you go
I like to think I'm a pretty slick guy
but something in the sunlight between your thighs
turned me into mush with a certified crush on you
and oh, what a bore I must be
you're so far ahead of my world
come back sunday (come back sunday)
everdays a monday
now that you're gone
come back sunday (come back sunday)
before I got a minute
the minute was gone
and it's never been so weird
to be at the bottom looking up
and I went into this movie of blood and guts
thinking I was the shit, I was all grown up
and I wonder, if you wonder, what we could be<start>Here we are at this party
Everything is going down
Music's playing loud
Keep the pressure off my coffee table
Momma said it's not loud
Girls are laughing way too loud
Jock's standing around
Oh damn they look so proud
A dude is spinning records
Like a stupid fool that won't stop
Quiet, quiet, baby
My ears are about to pop
Look who just walked through the door
It's Brian back from the store
To show the party he can break it
Just a little more
Hope there's more to life than this
I'm sure there's more to life than just
Spinning in circles
You got me spinning in circles
Hey there little girl
Haven't seen you for some time
How's life been
Is it good, is it bad, is it fine
Sorry, gotta make my rounds
See you when it dies down
Music so loud
Hell, your voice is drown
Hope there's more to life than this
I'm sure there's more to life than just
Spinning in circles
You got me spinning in circles
Now that the party's over
Hope everybody leaves here sober
Don't forget your lovely coat
I'm so relieved that nothing broke
Whoa whoa, stop right here, what do you know?
She just brought me another one
Just like the other one
Sorry pretty baby, but I think I'm done
You better slow down girl
You look a little wired
I gonna slow down myself
'Cause I'm a little tired
Hope there's more to life than this
Better be more to life than just
Spinning in circles
You got me spinning in circles
You got me spinning in circles
You got me spinning in circles<start>Hey girl
Where in the world did you come from
Hey girl
Where in the world do you belong
Hey girl
Watching you walk is like a dream
Hey girl
You've got nerve and you sure got me
As I wanted
Singing lost and found
Like a fever running
We could clear this town
Hey girl
Where in the world did you come from
Hey girl
Nobody knows where you belong
So why don't you tell me
You're hanging above me
There's room everywhere
And I can't walk on air
Hey girl
Hey girl
Hey girl
Where in the world did you come from
Hey girl
Never return 'cause you belong
I said
Hey girl
I said
Hey girl<start>I talk to God as much as I talk to Satan 'cause I want to hear both sides
Does that make me cynical
There are no miracles
And this is no miraculous life
I savour hate as much as I crave love because
I'm just a twisted guy
Is this pinnacle, is this the pinnacle, the pinnacle of being alive
Now I see the light
Well I look up to god and I see trouble 'cause this ain't a miracle
I just want to take my chance to live through a miracle
Ooahh
Ooahh
I know for certain that someone is watching but, is it from up or down
I make you miserable you stick with me although
You know I'm going to ruin your life
I talk to God as much as I talk to Satan 'cause I want to hear both sides
Does that make me cynical
There are no miracles
And this is no miraculous life
We walk into the ride
Well I look up to God and I see trouble 'cause this ain't a miracle
I just want to take my chance to live through a miracle
When the see-saw snaps and splinters your hand don't come crying to me
I'll only see your good side
And believe it's a miracle
A miracle
I slap the water and watch
The fish dance to the ripples of us
We're the dull blue duds
Blinking eyes encased in rust
This ain't a miracle
This ain't a miracle
This ain't a miracle
This ain't a miracle
Ooahh
Ooahh<start>I'm feeling dumb
I've not written a single word in days
Please let me go
I wanna leave
I've never felt so clean
My Love is shared
My eyes impaled
I'm using half a lung
I hope I died when I am old
I hope that you have fun
Ooh, I'm so sick of it here..<start>I don't like such stupid people
With their
I don't like your worthless friends
With the talk about their problems
With a can of small talk, they'll feel good
But they are fools
I don't like to sit beside you
In your brand new car
I don't like to show you need
Every day and night
You come into my life like someone
Being a star, but you are no more
After a few days with you
I was glad to be alone again
Glad, so glad, so glad, alone
Glad, so glad, so glad, alone
If you have to work for nothing
a day
Tears and sweat I had in future
Not much more to live
You come into my life like someone
Being a star, but you are no more
After a few days with you
I was glad to be alone again
Glad, so glad, so glad, alone
Glad, so glad, so glad, alone<start>He caught a train heading to sea-town from LA
A paper soon to be money well spent
but not enough to forgive him for what he's done
still home, he heads
Somebody's outlaw might make it home tonight
Somebody's outlaw might make it home tonight, yeah,
oh, yeah
Mom always told me this was how to be a man
slit her throat and disregard her only son
I cross my fingers, hope to god I won't become a fake, a lie
Somebody's outlaw might make it home tonight, yeah
Somebody's outlaw might make it home tonight<start>I remember the time
all through the night
trying not to close my eyes again
Too many hours
in a stolen car
trying not to pull over and cry
My eyes so red
I just want to die
Kill me with your words
Kill me one last time
Cut out my heart
and throw it on the floor,
for everyone to see
Remember you said,
'Kiss me sweetheart,
before you go again.'
Don't say
'It's over this time.'
She's bleeding on the inside
for me to call again
Waiting for her just to say goodbye
just one last time
Bleeding on the inside
Am I supposed to say
anything at all
to make you want me back
If I had three wishes
I'd wish them all on you
I'd wish you away
from me
Am I supposed to say
anything at all
She's bleeding on the inside
for me to call on again
Waiting for her just to say goodbye<start>I'm alive - and the world shines for me today
I'm alive - suddenly I am here today
Seems like forever (and a day), thought I could never (feel this way)
Is this really me? I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive - and the dawn breaks across the sky
I'm alive - and the sun rises up so high
Lost in another world (far away), never another word (till today)
But what can I say? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
(Instrumental break)
Suddenly came the dawn (from the night), suddenly I was born (into light)
How can it be real? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive - and the world shines for me today
I'm alive - suddenly I am here today
Seems like forever (and a day), thought I could never (feel this way)
Is this really me? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
(Instrumental break)
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive<start>Someone plays a solo on a saxophone
Oh, you've never seen somebody throw their head so slow
And I see her cringe your lips and drop an ear that way
Scratch a dog behind its ear and it might do the same
Hey lover, hey lover
Hey lover, hey lover
Blue and white racing stripe pick-up truck
And when did I decide to grow this beard and gut?
Well, I may be white but I don't like my people much
But I want to raise with you and watch our younglings hatch,
Fucking make the first letters of their first names match
Hey lover, hey lover
Hey lover, hey lover
Well I'm back into the boring life that I once led
Stuffing white spread asshole on a sofa bed
Sometimes I hate myself for trying to be so bold
But nothing ever seems to get this story told
Hey lover, hey lover
Hey lover, hey lover
I never tell her when she plays a song I never heard
Because I always learn the music and forget the words
But I want to ride with her and I wish I sung that well
Just copy, paste, google search, and send it to myself
Hey lover, hey lover
Hey lover, hey lover<start>Your eyes are raised to heaven
When I'm sitting on the floor
At your feet. What am I for?
Do I create or just translate
Between you and your mind
The art you'll never find?
And when your pen runs out of ink
You'll close the book and with me
Leave behind your memory
Are you brilliant? Are you blind?
Would you have nothing more to say
If I ever flew away?
In the end is it you, is it me?
Do I have anything? What am I for?
But when I walk out that door
Your prayers are plenty when you have
An empty page before you
And still I may adore you
For you take dictation better
Than most poets true compose
Your lines far surpass those
You pray for what you know will come
Your confidence is flattering
But still it's quite another thing
Compelled to inspire when to dream
Is all you really understand
The letters from your hand
Will never quite belong to you
And even then I only pray
That when I leave you'll softly say
"Goodbye."<start>Just another casualty, layin' on the line
Killin' one another until the end of time
Hear their screams, feel their pain look into their eyes
They say that war's a bitch its just a pack of lies
[Chorus:]
Search and destroy [4x] politicians choice corporations
They fuck the fuckin' country
To uphold their fucking name
Future is unwritten but
The lies remain the truth
We praise all of the heroes
Then we take their abuse
[Chorus:]
I want to live to see tomorrow
With my own eyes
'Cause I'll be there when your day
Comes propaganda lies
And when your marching
Shooting your guns I'll know the truth
Peace ain't something that you die for
In the glory of youth<start>Five years ago
You were safe with your TV
Never even thought
What the things you might be
Now you're just a pack rat
Picking through the rubble
Scared of your own shadow
Tryin' to hide from the trouble
Where is that compact
To which you were devoted?
Weren't you surprised
When your world exploded?
Your happy days are over
Now that we've found you
Resist or surrender
Doesn't matter we'll destroy you
[Chorus: x3]
Warlords, join us or we'll blow you away!
Maybe you've got brains
Maybe you're ruthless
Maybe you're just lucky
And we might let you join us
Maybe you just got
Something we need
Your house or your food
Your guns or your money
Don't ask for mercy
We don't know what it means
The closest thing I got is my M16
We love to have fun
We love to go berserk
Murder, rape, and pillage
Man, it's all a day's work
[Chorus: x4]
A string of victims, a legacy of blood
We've left the competition
Bleeding in the mud
We've got the numbers
And we've got the guns
And if you've got more than us
We'll know enough to run
[Chorus: x4]<start>See amid the winter's snow
Born for us on earth below
See the tender Lamb appears
Promised from eternal years
Hail, thou ever-blessed morn
Hail, redemption's happy dawn
Sing through all Jerusalem
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Say, ye holy shepherds, say
What your joyful news today
Wherefore have ye left your sheep
On the lonely mountain steep?
Hail, thou ever-blessed morn
Hail, redemption's happy dawn
Sing through all Jerusalem
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Sacred infant, all divine
What a tender love was thine
Thus to come from highest bliss
Down to such a world as this
Hail, thou ever-blessed morn
Hail, redemption's happy dawn
Sing through all Jerusalem
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hail, thou ever-blessed morn
Hail, redemption's happy dawn
Sing through all Jerusalem
Christ is born in Bethlehem<start>Ten men stand in line
At the gates of the cemetery on Tuesday morning
They're not open today
And ten moms stand in line
At maternity ward
They're not bringin' no babies out to play
Anytime today
What's a nice girl like you doin'
Walkin' around this part of town?
See you sometime tomorrow
And ten men stand in line
Waitin' for some personality to be put out on the corner

Ain't no grabage taken today<start>Original performer: taj mahal

Won't take a dive, we're gonna thrive
We got a condition called ambition
To the cosmic utopian thrivin' mission
Chorus
Witness this, yo the pissed lyricist
In your face celebratin' a brand new race
We know colors are just brothers and some others

Now speakin on a round, step back mother fucker, I'm goin' to town
Chorus
I feel good
Break it down

Honey, you're my lucky day

Baby, you're my lucky day
Well I lost all the other bets I made
Honey, you're my lucky day

Call it black magic Black black black
Call it black magic or nothing at all

I'll put you back in the stall
So mysterious When I feel curious Are you religious

Call it black magic or nothing at all

Some like it cool Break all the rules
Some strike Others bite
Some just do what they like
Oh do what you like<start>You give me the madness
I'll give you a sign
No need to be mindless
At the scene of the crime
Now do you have a confession
That you want to make?
Your resurrection
I'm ready to take
Release the fantasy
And catch the final trip
Unleash the majesty
And tighten up your grip
Inside your memory
Has choked on broken glass
Beneath the Karma tree
You know this too shall pass
I won't let you walk this path alone
Confessor
Let the motor burn
Confessor
Its time to overturn
Confessor
Can't justify the past
I see your colors
Were born to last
It's your resolution
What cannot be done
A simple solution
Before it all begun
And if you happen to see me
I'm already there
Out here on the hillside
I'm everywhere
Release the fantasy
And catch the final trip
Unleash the majesty
And tighten up your grip
Inside your memory
Has choked on broken glass
Beneath the Karma tree
You know this too shall pass
I won't let you walk this path alone
Confessor
Let the motor burn

I won't let you walk this path alone<start>Big stretch and not much sleep
I got a couple of palm trees on each side of my cheek
And it's a bright blue Saturday
And the rummage sells the rubbish to me
But if I could buy the sky
That's hangin' over this bed of mine
If I could climb these vines
And maybe see what you're seein'
If you were standing on the corner
Staring straight into the eyes of Jesus Christ
One porch, one dog, one cockroach only way to be
I got sewage fruit and it's growing out back from roots
I don't know if they belong to me
But if I could buy the sky
That's hangin' over this bed of mine
And if I could climb these vines
And maybe see what you're seein'
Sittin' at the edge of this building
Twenty stories below
A-twenty stories below
Twenty stories below
Twenty stories below
I can't tell you how many ways that I've sat
And viewed my life today, but I can tell you
I don't think that I can find easier way
So if I see you walking hand in hand in hand
With a three-armed man, you know I'll understand
But you should have been in my shoes yesterday
You should have been in my shoes yesterday
(Pockets full of crappiness
Can't piece together my day
So I pose myself this question
Maybe sleeps gonna get me in the shade
I got my head buried in this pillow
I got my head buried in this pillow
So low...)<start>Time to rewind
Back to 1995 when we were nothing
Walking through the streets of Boston no one listening
No one caring about the empty rooms we played
Until they all showed up one for one day
Then we took the stage and everything changed
Turn that shit up louder!
Make it all go faster!
Play it through the witching hour!
Take it to one thousand horsepower!
Under lights now
Playing to the masses everything feels right
Taking state by state by country over night
Living in a shell entering every fight
Seeing millions of people Rage
When we take our stage, everybody scream
Turn that shit up louder!
Make it all go faster!
Play it through the witching hour!
Take it to one thousand horsepower! Yeah!
Turn it up one more time
Get it up get it up, and feel alive
Turn it up turn it up one more time
Get it up get it up, and feel alive
Turn it up turn it up one more time
Get it up get it up, and feel alive
Turn it up turn it up one more time
Get it up get it up, and feel alive! Yeah!
Turn that shit up louder!
Make it all go faster!
Play it through the witching hour!
Take it to one thousand horsepower!
Turn that shit up louder!
Make it all go faster!
Playing through the witching hour!
Take it to one thousand horsepower!<start>I got nothing to lose, nothing to prove
Yet the clock keeps ticking, ticking my time away
My sweet mother ain't got nothing to save
I got one foot in the gutter, one in the grave
I'm asking why, why, why?
Do you wanna see me try, try, try?
Fall back, kick it through to another day
Spit the bit, cut the reigns, make it go away
Come on, get up, get down
And give your horns up
Raise your horns up, yeah
Well, I feel it coming over me, yeah, yeah
Come on, get up, get down
And give your horns up
Raise your horns up, yeah
Well, I feel you breaking under me
Well, I'm coming at you, 1, 2, 3
Double fist pounding, baby
Yeah, I say you better think twice
Crosses fall when you're running with me, yeah, yeah
I'll take you down, down, down
Kicking 'til you're 6 feet under the ground
Smoke that ass like the days last cigarette
Light the fires, burn the tires, screaming blood and sweat
Come on, get up, get down
And give your horns up
Raise your horns up, yeah
Well, I feel it coming over me, yeah, yeah
Come on, get up, get down
And give your horns up
Raise your horns up, yeah

It's taking control, taking control of me
Ooh, yeah, I feel you breaking under me

And I read the latest news
I tapped my feet in dumb surprise
And of course I saw they knew
The Pinkertons pulled out my bags
And asked me for my name
I stuttered out my answer
And hung my head in shame
Now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Now they've found me
Well I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun
Now I've seen this chain gang
Lord I say let me see my priest
I couldn't have faced your desert sand
Old burning brown backed beast
The poor house they hit me for my kin
And claimed my crumbling walls
Now I know how Reno felt
When he ran from the law
Now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family

I'm not a piece in their games
Can't control me
They're the only ones to be blamed
I'll never break down
I won't give up this fight
I'll give them nothing, nothing, nothing
Ohh oh ohh
Just one kiss
And I will be hooked to her fire
Her flames are surrounding me now
As we watch as they light up the sky
We must stand up and fight
Cause this love is not a game to me
We'll survive
And start an uprising
You can ignite (you can ignite)
Stand and fight (stand and fight)
Don't cave in (don't cave in)
So let the games begin
Ohh
Notice me
Cause I've been here all along
I've been waiting
Since you sang me your song
It's our moment
To turn things around
And show them something
With nothing, with nothing
And now our star-crossed love has materialized
We locked our fate right here right now
Just one kiss
And I will be hooked to her fire
Her flames are surrounding me now
As we watch as they light up the sky
We must stand up and fight
Cause this love is not a game to me
We'll survive
And start an uprising
You can ignite (you can ignite)

Ohh oh<start>Listen to me...
I've got a warning for you
You've got to learn to take more care
'Cause if you swim in dirty water
Be careful how you dry your hair
In a room within a room
In a hole within a hole
You've got to learn to share your secrets
Or you'll lose your soul
I've got the evidence
I know you broke
The unwritten law
Another town, another one night stand
You know, you broke the law...
It's so hard to hold back
When the fire is in your eyes
A silver dollar in my pocket
I don't like surprises
I've got your souvenir
Is that the price I've got to pay?
It ain't been that long
Since the last charade
I've got the evidence
I know you broke
The unwritten law
Another town, another one night stand
You know, you broke the law...
I know you're guilty
But I'm carrying the blame
I took out much more than I put in
And I felt the pain
In a dirty little room
With nowhere left to hide
You told the truth with your eyes
But you lied inside
I've got the evidence
I know you broke
The unwritten law
Another town, another one night stand
You know, you broke the law...<start>I left MTL and my babe behind,
this is anarchy one more time,
5 Aussies and a Greek in the van,
travelled across the world to drive across this land.
Let 'em loose,
let 'em loose.
Start her up and hit the juice,
hope to God we don't hit a fuckin' moose.
Endless highway and cigarette butts,
bloodshot eyes,
empty coffee cups.
Been driving for a thousand kliks,
and now I'm getting pulled over by the pigs again (Fuck).
Feel the tension in the van.
Unless you've done it you'd never understand,
gotta make it to the next show,
sleep deprivation overload,
anal vapours,
smelly socks,
sleeping on a pizza box.
Wasted in a bar,
Vancouver B.C.
Swilling back the brews,
reflecting on the journey.
It was long and hard and that's a bloody fact,
only problem now is I gotta drive back. Fuck.
- From Rachel Lamb.<start>Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
Penetrate the evenin' that the
City sleeps to hide
Let's swim out tonight love
It's our turn to try
Parked beside the ocean
On our moonlight drive
Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
Surrender to the waiting worlds
That lap against our side
Nothin' left open
And no time to decide
We've stepped into a river
On our moonlight drive
Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
You reach your hand to hold me
But I can't be your guide
Easy how to love you
As I watch you glide
Falling through wet forests
On our moonlight drive, baby
Moonlight drive
Come on, baby, gonna take a little ride
Down, down by the ocean side
Gonna get real close
Get real tight
Baby gonna drown tonight
Goin' down, down, down<start>Stressing the fracture
Breathing brings pain
Though infinity remains
Strength is gone
Provoke the confrontation
Building strain burning combustion
Everlasting stain
Hunt begins, over time
Inching closer the pray am I
Then divide, circle low
Into the system vultures go
Lashing out at those who are pure
You stare right through me
The dull rusty edge
That has become my mood
You are sold you bought the mold
And now your eyes see only
The place you think I hold
In the machine
That owns your sold
I defy your sunken mind
To judge me by your own design
Hypocrite laughter, averted gaze
You drift through life in robotic
Haze
Breeding, slowly shaping
Manipulating, twisted shape
Conforms
Now locked in motion of the blind
When did they start
To mold your thoughts
Trained to be one of many
When did you shut off
Questions in your mind
Betray yourself and fall in line
Where status now dictates the rule
Loss of all hope, failed source
The hardened mold constricts
What once was free
Society's victim, you
You choke on yours
I'll choke on mine
To your hypocrusy you're blind
Below the surface
Who do you despide
Your feeble self stripped of their lie<start>I can hear your voice and I have no choice
'Cause the pain is too deep inside
And the hurt of a love that is lost has no cure
But the love of another heart
Your friends try and say it will all get better
They say that they know how you feel
But your heart isn't sure 'cause it knows what it heard
All the things that it read in the letter
All the words of wisdom
Never seem to ease the pain
All the words of wisdom sound the same
All the lies of kindness
Oh that sweet refrain
But you pay the price for the joy that it brings
'Cause you hear the sound of her name
And the morning tries to save you
From the shadows of your heart
They dance and kiss as you reminisce
And it's tearing you apart<start>I woke up to the sound of German hip hop in my head
A great unholy clatter quickly filling me with dread
I wondered then if silence had forever disappeared
What, with everybody yelling the end was finally here
I scrambled for the television, desperate for its light
Hoping that my favorite stars could stop this endless night
I waited for instructions, I waited for a sign
I listened very carefully when told just what to buy
Lovers became bitter, mathematicians counting crumbs
Some were filled with angry lust, the rest felt mostly numb
The sun became the enemy, they'd hunger after dark
And kill time swapping partners at a club called Noah's Arc
Those who spoke of doom impending, suffering and such
Had found the place in people's heart that beauty had once touched
They filled the auditorium, the tickets far from cheap
Those that couldn't get in started fighting in the street
The day came so we gathered in a field behind the mall
A noted scientist predicted there we'd see it all
The city council members came, they told us not to fear
The king and queen of homecoming both shed a poignant tear
Just like that it happened, the starling blinked its eye
The molecules collided and became part of the sky
All my life I've never known a moment quite so still
Like space that's being emptied at the same time that it's filled
I woke up to the sound of German hip hop in the air
It sounded like a hum of insects nesting in my hair
I wasn't so much tired but I felt that I should sleep
So I closed my eyed and mumbled something about a soul to keep<start>Oi
You must understand
That I have got the right
To say just what I like
You try to move us on
And we've done nothing wrong
We won't be gone for long
What have we done to you?
What have we dont to you?
You didn't like the way we hung around in town
And you couldn't leave us alone to be ourselves
You made our lives like hell
And we hadn't done anything wrong
You thought that we were weak
But we turned out to be strong
Oi
You might think that you are going to be the best
But you ain't seen the rest
You try to move us on
And we've done nothing wrong
We won't be gone for long

I'm going to tickle, tickle him on the tummy, because he laughs so funny. He's so jolly & so fine when he comes around Christmas time.
I'm gonna lasso Santa Claus & the reason is because ...I know a boy & girl he never comes to see. He never brings them toys like he does to me.

The strong survive you'll see
Pacing every move
We will not be tamed
I wonder if you think of me
As a human being
We don't really care
To us you mean nothing
Bloodshed in the streets
As the Bruisers defeat
Trying to make a find
Of our weakest link
You'll never get the answer
So don't you even think
Because we are here
And here to stay
We will rule the streets

There's too many things I can't afford
So what do you mean when you say
That she's your girlfriend today
I wouldn't ever want to rush you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Love's not beating down on my door
I guess it's cause ooh, I got lucky, lucky before
I wouldn't ever want to rush you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Wealth is boring without happiness
Fame is notorious for causing stress
Health is for binging on in between drinks
Money over matter for the rich in minks
I wouldn't ever want to rush you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Never want to rush you
Don't want to lose you

Don't want to lose you

And no one understands,
He will lift you up.
When you feel no arms of love surround you
And you're all alone inside,
He will be your guide.
He will lift you up, close to the heavens
Feel His embrace rushing down like the rain
Turn up your face and thank your Heavenly Father
For He will lift you up
'Cause He feels the pain you feel
And he longs to bear it for you
His love will soon reveal the plans He has in store for you
He will lift you up, close to the heavens
Feel His embrace rushing down like the rain
Turn up your face and thank your Heavenly Father
For He will lift you up
He will lift you up, close to the heavens
Feel His embrace rushing down like the rain
Turn up your face and thank your Heavenly Father

Going it over it in my head
And it's all useless
Well, it's been years since I've seen home
There'll be plenty time when I'm dead
And it's all useless
There's a lot swimming around
Swimming around in my head
And it's all such a mess
There's a lot to be done
Now I'll lay me down to become

We'll take it slow
And even if you're never home
Even if so
There's a lot swimming around
Swimming around in my head

Now I'll lay me down to become

We'll take it slow

Maybe I'm the fool in your eyes
Maybe I'm the weak one
Maybe I'm a liar in disguise
Maybe I'm angry
'Cause I'm the one who's always wrong
Maybe I'm not the one who's so strong
Did you think about it
Did you pour it in and pour it out
Could you live without me
Did you ever really have a doubt
But do you understand it baby
When you say it's over, its done
Maybe I'm not the one
So If you're gonna leave
Yeah you better get going
'Cause I ain't wasting no more time
On what you did, and what you didn't
So if you're gonna leave
Yeah you better start running
'Cause I ain't wasting no more time
On what might have been
We can stand on reason
We can fight about all the things
This isn't forever
This is more than a wedding ring
But do you understand it baby
When you say it's over, its done
Maybe I'm not the one
So If you're gonna leave
Yeah you better get going
'Cause I ain't wasting no more time
On what I did, and what I didn't
So if you're gonna leave
Yeah you better start running
'Cause I ain't wasting no more time
Oh, did it happen again
With the things that you wanted
From being a friend
How did it happen again
Just look onward baby
Someday you might need a friend
So if you're gonna leave
Yeah you better get going

Of the widow at the end of the street:

As harmless as a spider,
She offered him her bed.
She Wolf grabbed him by the throat and yelled
"This is what i need!"
She Wolf ripped his head off shrieking
"Open up and bleed!"

By the wicked hands of man.
Unholy maggot on her soul to the end
In death she made her last stand:

Man took from women ALL.
No more subservient wife,
No longer do I bid your call.
As a blood oath then,

They always _________ one by one.
Living in their pockets, living in their pockets.
They were always sincere.
Hip to the freshest ideas,
The latest ideas.
I'm clinging to fresh, new mistakes.
I've got some new faults to force on you.
It won't be wrong to prove you wrong.
It's never hard to prove you wrong,

I fell in with a crowd of freaks
Half were dead and half alive
Half would kill you the other half would try
Hooked and baited lined and weighted
Thrown in with the shit and brine
So when the Devil's time is due
And this Devil swallows you
When half a truth is half a lie
And sickness never felt so right
Shame throws down a deathly notion
Creeping up over black black ocean
Drifting drowning death came pounding
Over under rape and plunder
And I can't swim and I can't breathe
Drowning on this drunken sea
Black black ocean creeping tide
Wash over me and then leave me to die<start>Please, don't flatter yourself
You're not the only one
Whose heart has ever fell
Please, don't exaggerate
Don't tell me you're okay
Okay, okay
[Chorus]
I will admit if you'll admit it
It's harder than we both thought
It's easier to fall apart
Look where we are
I can forgive it, I can't forget it
You left me here with all these scars
And you can't deny the hardest part: I'm not in your arms
We're hurt more than we appear
The world will never know
We both have taste in tears
My dear
You're denying what I say
Don't act like it's okay
'Cause it's not okay
[Chorus]<start>Close your eyes December Child
And dream a while my little son and moon
May the stars be your crown
And may the earth guide you round and round
Snuggle up and let me hold kiss
Your baby breath in the dark and cold
On a silent night long ago
Another mother held her babe and told him
Chorus:
Close your eyes December Child
And dream a while my little son and moon
May the stars be your crown
And may the earth guide you round and round
They had come such a long long way
Rest your little head on me and I'll tell you of
A little king and his bed of hay
It is remembered every Christmas day
Little one, little son
All my life I've wished you welcome
Chorus:
Close your eyes December Child
And dream a while my little son and moon
May the stars be your crown
And may the earth guide you round and round<start>Girls these days, they wanna come first
To know who they are, to know what they're worth.
They wanna have nights where everything works,
Keep it like nobody gets hurt.
They wanna smile when they press rewind,
They don't want life to pass them by,
They wanna feel, they wanna touch,
Girls these days, they want so much.
They'll fool you into thinkin' that you're gonna drive,
Then you'll be looking over from the passenger's side,
Girls these days.
Girls these days.
Girls these days, they wanna control,
When they say stop, wait, go.
They put your number in and leave you wonderin' if it's yes or no.
What they got is so good you'll be runnin' red lights.
It could be jackpot if you play your hand right.
Girls these days.
Girls these days.
These days they'll tell you what their name is
These days they'll walk right up to strangers
Girls these days.
Beautiful...
Girls these days are beautiful...
And guys like me are barely keepin' up
Guys like me are still fallin' in love
With these girls, these girls, these girls, these girls, these days
Girls these days.
Girls these days.

Day to day we fight that fight
Nothing new, it's the same old grind
Uphill all the way
Boss man says forget the raise
Preacher says to keep the faith
Good things come to those who wait
Tomorrow's another day
Our time is coming
When or where the good Lord only knows
Our time is coming
When this road we're on will turn to a street of gold
Long as we keep love alive
Something tells me we'll survive
It's the little things that'll get us by
And hold us together
I feel it when you hold me close
Baby we got more than most
Steady through the highs and lows
We'll go on forever
Our time is coming
When or where the good Lord only knows
Our time is coming
When this road we're on will turn to a street of gold
When this road we're on will turn to a street of gold<start>Say hello to the quiver
The skin your spine
That skin moving pictures
Secret moments of time
That skin and your innards
Giving up your mind
Inside feed forever
As you wait in line
Say hello
As you go
Hear the call of your master
Try to speak there's no reply
Standing there with the nameless
And hear the silent cries
Look above at the ceiling
Realize accept your plight
Try to reach him
He will break you
Your weakness is his might
Say hello
As you go<start>I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
Oh, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases
All your Christmases
May all your Christmases be white<start>From candles burning, shadows in the night
People praying for eternal life
But my mind just keeps on wandering
Away from this serene and hallowed place
To a woman's face
She was lovely, lovely as a dream
She had the beauty, the beauty of a queen
They say that every man who meets her sooner or later will fall
Even me that they call
The master of invention, the painter of our times
I can take you round the Heavens and show you how to fly
'Twas a moment caught forever, there was something in her eyes
But I wish I could remember why Mona Lisa smiled
She sat before me, this woman so divine
Something eternal was shining in her eyes
Oh, Lisa del Giocondo, you opened up a world of mystery
When you were looking at me
The master of invention, the painter of our times
I can take you 'round the Heavens and show you how to fly
'Twas a moment caught forever, there was something in her eyes
But I wish I could remember why Mona Lisa smiled
Shame the devil in my heart but I can't stop thinking about her
And what she's doing to me, doing to me
'Twas a moment of perfection, the canvas never lies
But I wish I could remember why Mona Lisa smiled
Why Mona Lisa smiled?
Why Mona Lisa smiled?
Why Mona Lisa smiled?<start>Hired gun

The spirit of her is walking back to me
Ah look at me now feeling emotion
Ah look at me now
The king of the castle brought her to her knees
Gave the salvation army girl a squeeze
Ah look at me now feeling emotion
Ah look at me now
Look at me now
Now she's a sallow face
Scattering her lace - on dewy ground
Ah, I keep searching my head
Now it's spinning around
Lifting her head, her countenance redeemed
Re-acted the murder by the silver stream
Ah look at me now displaying emotion
Ah look at me now<start>I haven't been able to make that sound for quite some time
It's been described as a rock crying out for somewhere to land or someone to throw it
You could have taken me to the place of the one who took my place
Instead you said 'I'll just kiss him on the face like Judas did & that's how you'll know it'
I'll bet you wish you'd let the old man fall on his head
& tumble down the hillside
Cause looking back on it & holding your hand out instead
It seemed like such a cheap time
You're not remembering it was you who started this mess you're in
You keep forgetting your the wall the car crashed into or through, or maybe you're the car
I could have warned you but the obvious points are the hardest to make
& you've been up a certain creek so long that a paddle wouldn't cut it, you're gonna need an oar
& if you feel like none of this was worth it - well you're right
& if you feel like none of us deserves this - well we might
& if you feel like trying to rebuild this - well you're on your own<start>He's got the power
He's like a god
But he's the devil of flesh and blood
A '45 is his religion
Code of silence his belief
It's the kiss of death
A '45 is his religion
Code of silence his belief
You can find them in a gutter
You will find 'em in your church
They always knows each other
They call it family
You may end up six-feet-under
Anywhere and anytime
It's a one-way-street with a thousand lanes
And a million ways to die
A Thompson sub-machine gun made my day
Sick, dirty and mean
You can hide but you can't run
Sick, dirty and mean
Headhunters cut you down
A godfather's kiss
An icepick in your eye
Sick, dirty and mean
It's like a killing machine
Can you hear your mother crying
Can you see your father die
Can you walk away from children
Dying facedown in the dirt
But if you break the code of silence
You gotta do it anyway
If we don't stop the violence
The mob is here to stay
A pair of concrete slippers
There all vultures all over your back
Sick, dirty and mean
You can hide but you can't run
Sick, dirty and mean
Headhunters cut you down
They will terminate your contract
They will finalize the deal
Sick, dirty and mean
It's a killing machine
A '45 is his religion
Code of silence his belief
It's a double barreled shotgun
With an Ouzi on the side
Sick, dirty and mean
You can hide but you can't run
Sick, dirty and mean
Headhunters cut you down
If you want to be a songbird
There's an axe to clip your wings
Sick, dirty and mean
It's a killing machine
Sick, dirty and mean
Sick, dirty and mean
Sick, dirty and mean
Sick, dirty and mean<start>You must have heard about my little problem
Ah, come on, you must have heard about it
It's no ordinary problem
Look in my eyes, there can be no doubt about it
And of course, it gets worse at night
It gets late, things start to change
The clock is stopped, thermometer is bulging
Hot, late night bound to make us estranged
Softer me all over your shoulders
Cold shadow in the glare of the glow
Factory billboards on outskirts of cities
Shine down new attractions to the traffic below
[Chorus]
Remember this day, remember this road
Remember this secret secret, I remember you
A certain flash, a certain light
Abandoning the afternoon as it sinks into the night
Fluorescent bedroom flicker starts to tech me to wonder
I hear a mandolin and hear the springs
Out the wardrobe floats the hint of a rumour
Dressed in your blue velvet finest things
Can you hear the voices that I constantly talk of
Am I the only one to succumb to their rule
Well, I know the form that it's taking
It's not making sense anymore
They way you say you just want to help me
The way your clinging is slinging me under
The strength I need already denied me
Your big ideas and your ideas and your little wonder
[Chorus]<start>On the night that my love broke through
On the night that my love broke through
Revelations that came unglued
On the night that my love broke through
Cell doors were opened,
God stepped out the way,
Prisoners got one acre of land and one year's pay.
Flower's long since dead
Stiffened at the neck.
Colours came back in green and yellow and in red.
Unemployed cowboys
Staggered on Fairfax.
Trucks pulled up and fifteen men hollered and hopped in back.
A copy of Vechouski[?],
At the bottom of the stack,
Got picked up by some dropout who read it front to back
Send me out the tin hands of the past![?]
Hands are crawling out of
Grimy bathtub drains.
Janitor was laughing, he had finally gone insane.
City buses swerving,
Arriving right on time.
Vending machines were serving glasses of white wine by the dime.
Street lights got a burst of
Electricity.
Sparks danced across windshields like a grand finale.
Metal detectors beeping,
Sound was deafening.
Everywhere bleeding at dug up wedding rings.
We all stopped to listen to it sing!
On the night that my love broke through
On the night that my love broke through
Revelations that came unglued..
On the night that my love broke through
On the night
On the night
On the night
On the night<start>Do you think about what you do or what you say?
Does it matter who gets fucked along the way?
Is it worth the effort just to see them pay?
If everybody does it doesn't make everything okay
I'd like to wipe this, I'd like to wipe this from my mind
I'd like to step away, I'd like to step away
I am so sick and tired of this, tired of this
Would you like to go away, away from here
Where you don't have to address what you can't hear
All that you do, you don't believe everything
All that you do, you don't believe anything<start>I cant find a four leaf cover anymore
I could find it if I wanted to
I believe if you put your mind to something
Well, there aint anything in this world you could not do
But I cant find one honest man
Why cant I find me one honest man
Dont understand
The only thing I ever wanted
Was a little bouquet of truth from him
But it gave me all the things you cant build love on
And I am on the wrong side of a broken heart again
Why cant I find one honest man
Why cant I find me one honest man
Dont understand
If a little bitty candle can light off the darkness
Why cant it shine its way through?
Ive been waiting a very, very, very long time
Aint no man ever gonna be true
Dont understand
Aint there a man for me
Why cant I find one honest man
Why cant I find me one honest man

Why cant I find one honest man
Why cant I find me one honest man

no apologies I think you really should
always demonstrate your self righteous and
boring outlook now if in doubt
wish you were there
it's probably not long before
this feeling will subside won't choke me anymore
but until that day
your fucked up justifications
keep coming and coming
wish you were there
to contemplate just wastes my time
about as interesting as this annoying vocal whine
it could be advantageous to shove you
on an icebreaker south now somehow<start>When I saw you girl
All alone
It made me stare
You held me captivated
And your wondering, across the street
Then you sucked me in
I couldnt stay away from you
Last summer (oh oh oh)
You cast a spell you put me under (oh oh oh)
There's something about the way you look
It's taking me over
And now I know I wont forget
When we met last summer
Now a year has passed
And things have changed
Your popular
And it makes me feel degraded
And it hurts me so
I talk to you, you don't wanna know
Now all I ever think about is
Last summer (oh oh oh)
You cast a spell you put me under (oh oh oh)
There's something about the way you look
It's taking me over
And now I know I wont forget
When we met last summer<start>{Yeah, what you critics said would never happen
We dedicate this album to anybody people said couldn't make it
To the fans that held us down 'til everybody came around
Welcome, it's here}
That summer we took threes across the board
But by fall we were a cover story
"Now in stores"
Make us poster boys for your scene
But we are not making an acceptance speech
I have found the safest place to keep all our old mistakes
Every dot-com's refreshing for a journal update
So long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
Fix me in 45
So long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
Fix me in 45
I can take your problems away
With a nod and a wave of my hand
'Cause that's just the kind of boy that I am
The only thing I haven't done yet is die
And it's me and my plus one at the afterlife
Crowds are won and lost and won again
But all our hearts beat for the diehards
So long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
And fix me in 45
So long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
And fix me in 45
Long live the car-crash hearts
Long live the car-crash hearts
(Long live the car-crash hearts)
Long live the car-crash hearts
Long live the car-crash hearts
Long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
Fix me in 45

In mechanic salute the winter sun
pasted poorly above like a glittery
piece of tinfoil

If I'm this tired while having fun
it makes me worried that something's wrong
How much longer will I be young
So much stuff that I haven't done
On the soggy streets of Budapest
on an escape mission from the West
We met the remnants of the Welsh invasion
It took all our wit and bravery
and we had to stop for elevenses
So eventuall we chose to embrace them

How much longer will I be young
So much stuff that I haven't done

How much longer will I be young
In another bar, on another street
but it really might as well not be
We laugh and toast away the nighttime hours
And at 6 AM, when I go to sleep
All the birds are scowling in at me
And I beg them in their mercy to forgive us

How much longer will I be young<start>Sad and sorry,

All your jewels are dragging us down,

While everybody's starving inside,
But the doctor's never there and this medication,
Doesn't really keep me controlled

Are you asleep now,
I thought I heard you talking,
Cause they're draining out my heart,
And I think I know what's coming,
They can't leave this alone
But in this light,
I can see the angels burning from the inside out,
They spread their wings to die,
In this light,
I can see the people, the damaged goods they take this life,
It's passing by
You,
You know that I'm not that strong,
No one can get out,
I'm not able now,
You,
I know you're here to change,
We all stay the same,
I'm not able now,
I'm not able now,
Now.<start>I am a foreigner

And let your girl scouts
Lip-synch about the freedom
Just the way you want them but soon enough you'll see them
Soon enough they all turn around
And soon enough you'll see them in a different part of town

and toothless we try to bite
we live up to our standards
though we know they ain't right
fools we always stand up to fight when nothing's left to win
we draw the shades when we're bothered
ignorance is our twin
We've got our fancy but empty preconceived life
instance of how we wondered why we're seldom satisfied
but only the fools will applaud this strange self-deception
but only the fools will believe in resurrection of ideals in purest form
they're the first who have claimed their piece
and then the first who will ask for release
why do we sanction their means with a nod
boasting the absolute freedom of thought
we are fools
we hide with pride behind tolerant words
neglecting the fact that we've been lured
we are fools
we are fools

You were self sufficient and needless
Your house was fully decorated in that sense
You were taken with me to a point
A case of careful what you wish for
But what you knew was enough to begin
And so you called and courted fiercely
So you reached out, entirely fearless
And yet you knew of reservation and how it serves
And I salute you for your courage
And I applaud your perseverance
And I embrace you for your faith in the face of adversarial forces
That I represent
So you were in but not entirely
You were up for this but not totally
You knew how arms length-ing can maintain doubt
And so you fell and you're intact
So you dove in and you're still breathing
So you jumped and you're still flying if not shocked
And I support you in your trusting
And I commend you for your wisdom
And I'm amazed by your surrender in the face of threatening forces
That I represent
You found creative ways to distance
You hid away from much through humor
Your choice of armor was your intellect
And so you felt and you're still here
And so you died and you're still standing
And so you softened and you're still safely in command
Self protection was in times of true danger
Your best defense to mistrust and be wary
Surrendering a feat of unequaled measure
And I'm thrilled to let you in
Overjoyed to be let in in kind<start>When she was an American Girl, raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life, somewhere else
After all, it was a great big world,
With lots of places to run to,
And if she packed up, trying,
She got one little promise she was gonna keep
Oh yeah, alright
Take it easy baby, make it last all night
She was an American Girl!
Well, it was kinda cold that night,
She stood alone on her balcony
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by on the road 41
Like the waves crashing on the beach
Checked for one desperate moment there,
He crimped back in her memory
God, it's so painful something that's so close,
But still so far out of reach!
Oh yeah, alright
Take it easy baby, make it last all night
She was an American Girl!<start>Going back to the memories
Reminiscing bout you and me
Thinking how it used to be
It's plain and clear I treated you bad
But girl you know that I care
Every relation have wear and tear
Just draw near girl and try to hear and listen what my heart says
Many days and many nights
Many heartbreaks, many fights
Many wrongs but so many rights
So girl don't let this love die
Never meant to cause you no pain,
Girl I never meant to treat you lame.
Gimme one more chance rewind come back again.
Don't let this love die.
Just cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines
Can you feel me reaching out to you girl, can you hear my open thoughts
Never want disrespect you girl don't let this come break us apart.
'Cause I know I would die without you, my girl can you hear my broken heart.
It's calling out to the good times that we had back at the start.
Baby (Don't call me baby)
You know I need you in my life daily (You know you played me)
I was a player but now your love changed me (Dead wrong)
I'm going crazy (I'm gone)
Never thought losing you would be so hard
It's your turn to cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines
So let go
And move on
What we were
Is now undone
My tears have all dried
It's your turn now to cry
You're losing your love and your trust for me girl
And you know, I would go to the ends of the world.
If you wanted, just like we started.
Girl 'cause I don't want to fight no more.
Make it like it was before.
I tell you the truth and you cried and I cried
Let's get back to the place and that look in your eyes
Can you feel it inside, no clouds in your skies
The sun is gonna shine
Chat to her Santana
It's your turn to cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky

But I still can't place the name or the season
You say it's fine, keep your place in line
Keep biding your time but you talk in a vacuum
And you've been bought, I don't know what I want
But I know I don't want to be anything like you
All you bottom feeders and you smiling cheaters
You're a total blank and you're as funny as a bank
Not ready to drop, not ready to stop
Run away or compromise
I won't break down or go on the take now

Keep your crutch, I don't need much
Just a little luck 'cause my charm is broken
Get out of my sight and I'll be alright

You're out of your depth
Up to your neck in a sea of alibis
Swim or sink, deeper than you think
'Cause I'm on the brink of justifiable homicide

Transparent skin gives away your intentions
You're like a machine that gobbles up all dreams
And spits out shit too dull to mention

Specimens in a tank and you're as funny as a bank

Not ready to cop, run away or compromise

Seated in the darkened room
Do you thrill
When the green light starts pulsing
Paranoia
The only valid point of view
If you know what I'm saying
I'm not alone
Being followed
Someone always watching what we do
Never alone
But I'm in the shadows
I dream things I don't want you to know
Something shifting
Between the sirens and the glow
Of red lights
And the blue slowly turning
A fog is lifting
A silhouette begins the show
Then the moment is stolen
I'm not alone
Being followed
Someone always watching what we do
Never alone
But I'm in the shadows
I dream things I don't want you to know

Lit by scandal
Your the bullet
In the barrel

Never alone

Reason to make it through

I will make you come again
To the house on the hill
Where we first began
And this

I'm in
This is the skin I'm in
There may be permanent detractors
Some I used to know
There may be eminent danger
Road blocks with avalanche snow

You give me something new
You give hope and you give yourself

Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor
She's waiting tonight down in the parking lot
Outside the Seven-Eleven store
Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch
And he rides with me from town to town
We only run for the money, got no strings attached
We shut 'em up and then we shut 'em down
Tonight, tonight the strip's just right
I want to blow 'em off in my first heat
Summer's here and the time is right
For racin' in the street
We take all the action we can meet
And we cover all the northeast state
When the strip shuts down we run 'em in the street
From the fire roads to the interstate
Some guys they just give up living
And start dying little by little, piece by piece
Some guys come home from work and wash up
And go racin' in the street
Tonight, tonight the strip's just right
I want to blow 'em all out of their seats
Calling out around the world, we're going racin' in the street
I met her on the strip three years ago
In a Camaro with this dude from L.A.
I blew that Camaro off my back
And drove that little girl away
But now there's wrinkles around my baby's eyes
And she cries herself to sleep at night
When I come home the house is dark
She sighs, "baby did you make it all right"
She sits on the porch of her daddy's house
But all her pretty dreams are torn
She stares off alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born
For all the shut down strangers and hot rod angels
Rumbling through this promised land
Tonight my baby and me, we're gonna ride to the sea
And wash these sins off our hands
Tonight, tonight the highway's bright
Out of our way, mister, you best keep
'Cause summer's here and the time is right
For racin' in the street<start>You are a razor blade
You are precision-cut
You are a stare, sharp as a tack in my eye
At rest on my veins
The pulse in my neck
A sharp edge that questions the time I have left
...so you are on my mind.
I need a burning stake
I need a piercing dart
I need something as hard as an insult.
And I need to bleed
I need to burn
I need a sure thing
I need a sure thing
You are a paper bird
Folded and folded and creased
And bent and shaped from a five dollar bill
It's priceless to me
And never spent
It hangs from a ceiling fan over my bed
...so you are on my mind
I need a burning stake
I need a piercing dart
I need something as hard as an insult.
And I need to bleed
I need to burn
I need a sure thing
And you are a mystery to me
I'll hang my hopes all at once on a rope
To the possibility that this is happening to someone who's not me
I'll hold my head
Keep it still and pretend
That these spins in the webs
Are actually desirable
I need a burning stake
I need a piercing dart
I need something as hard as an insult.
And I need to bleed
I need to burn
I need a sure thing
And you are a mystery to me<start>she walks away from me my said misery her eyes her eyes are not like mine in lies the hardest truth 30 days and nothing nothing nothing her jawline her jawline is not like mine go alone go alone go alone go alone go alone go alone go alone go alone go alone go alone go alone go alone go alone both sides of you what did you want the world to do<start>(N.Cuerda/F.Amador)

Bajo una lluvia pliegas la razn

You rid your life of everything
You're on your way
And as the trapdoor closed
I said my prayers before you rose and fell away
Fell away, fell away, o no no no
Time forgets, I never will
And I can't help the way I feel
Strange how we seem to know
Which way our lives will go
Someone's about to leave
But that ain't me<start>Here's to the babies in a brand new world
Here's to the beauty of the stars
Here's to the travelers on the open road
Here's to the dreamers in the bars
Here's to the teachers in the crowded rooms
Here's to the workers in the fields
Here's to the preachers of the sacred words
Here's to the drivers at the wheel
Here's to you my little loves with blessings from above
Now let the day begin
Here's to you my little loves with blessings from above
Now let the day begin, let the day begin
Here's to the winners of the human race
Here's to the losers in the game
Here's to the soldiers of the bitter war
Here's to the wall that bears their names
Here's to you my little loves with blessings from above
Now let the day begin
Here's to you my little loves with blessings from above
Let the day begin, let the day begin, let the day start
Here's to the doctors and their healing work
Here's to the loved ones in their care
Here's to the strangers on the streets tonight
Here's to the lonely everywhere
Here's to the wisdom from the mouths of babes
Here's to the lions in the cage
Here's to the struggles of the silent war
Here's to the closing of the age.
Here's to you my little loves with blessings from above
Now let the day begin
Here's to you my little loves with blessings from above
Let the day begin
Here's to you my little loves with blessings from above
Let the day begin
Here's to you my little loves with blessings from above
Now let the day begin, let the day begin, let the day start
Submitted by Michael Hack<start>Distant love you left for distant town
Only need to whisper please don't shout
Plant the seed let seed of love grow
Floating down the stream against the flow
Fate please show me to the edge of town
Don't blast me to the moon I'll still come down
Distant love I don't know where to start
Shadowed by the blister on your heart
All I need is perfect timing
To dodge these tumbleweeds around me
Listen to my senseless rhyming
Your scent is all I need
It makes me sneeze
This is how you find me
Just listen when I sneeze
Your scent is all I need
I'll catch it on the breeze
Just listen when I sneeze
Your scent is all I need
This is how you find me<start>When I said I needed you
You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you and now you've gone away
Don't you see that now you've gone
And I'm left here on my own
That I have to follow you and beg you to come home
You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever I will understand
Believe me, believe me I can't help but love you
But believe me I'll never tie you down
Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and quite unreal
All that's left is loneliness there's nothing left to feel
You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand believe me, believe me
You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand, believe me, believe me<start>Why do you smile like that, when you look at me?
When you know I can't have you
Why do your glances seem like advances?
Is it just me? man I think you're going crazy
It aches in my heart
With my friends I'm always acting so cool
But I would sell out
If only to be closer to you
Cause there's nothing I can do...
I can't get you out of my thoughts
Or out of my heart and I know I'm in love with you baby
Everything I do, leads me back to you
You got to know that you're driving me crazy
Look at me girl, I'm a fool, I make you smile
But I know I can't have you
And I stare at the stars, wishing you weren't so far
From my arms, not alone
But I'm sick ofbeing lonely
I try to love someone else
And everyday I try to be true
It only make me feel worse
Cause all I do is think about you
And there's nothing I can do
I can't get you out of my thoughts
Or out of my heart and I know I'm in love with you baby
Everything I do, leads me back to you
You got to know that you're driving me crazy
I can't get you out of my thoughts
Or out of my heart and I know I'm in love with you baby
Everything I do, leads me back to you
You got to know that you're driving me crazy
Ahhh...
I can't get you out of my thoughts
Or out of my heart and I know I'm in love with you baby
Everything I do, leads me back to you
You got to know that you're driving me...
I can't get you out of my thoughts, or out of my heart,
And I know I'm in love with you baby,
Everything I do, leads me back to you,
Leads me back to you, leads me back to you, leads me back to you
I can't get you out of my thoughts
Or out of my heart and I know I'm in love with you baby
Everything I do, leads me back to you
Leads me back to you... (4x)
You... (2x)<start>I couldn't really understand at all
The writing on the wall
From you to me
A jigsaw puzzle of a twisted tale
That set its lonely sail
From you to me
'Cause I tried to get the message
But it's not understood
Wide apart and so far away
It mattered at the start until I realized instead ....
I'm flying in a troubled sky
Watching you as you go by
In an ordinary dream
I'm sailing on a troubled sea
Watching you as you watch me
In an ordinary dream
I couldn't understand a word it said
The letter that I read
From you to me
I couldn't fathom out the stuff you wrote
So I guess it's just a joke
From you to me
Though reality keeps calling me away from my dream
And the wreckage isn't all it might have been
Didn't matter at the start until I realized it did
I'm flying in a troubled sky
Watching you as you go by
In an ordinary dream
I'm sailing on a troubled sea
Watching you as you watch me
In an ordinary dream
I'm floating in a troubled sky
Watching you as you go by
In an ordinary dream
I'm sailing on a troubled sea
Watching you as you watch me
In an ordinary dream
Ordinary dream

And you still will not give one back to me
You never have good apology
And your hooves never wrap all the way around me
And if you want something you gotta give something
You can't take nothing if you don't give nothing away
Sometimes at the movies if I buy you a soda
You do sit just a little bit closer
And while we're all spending my money
Sometimes you do smile but I get mad
If you want something you gotta give something
You can't take nothing if you don't give nothing away
Would you share with me?
And whatever I got is never enough [Incomprehensible]
I feel so special when you are close to me
And if you cared it all for me
You would swear to God that you hated me
And send me away with [Incomprehensible]
If you want something you gotta give something
You can't take nothing if you don't give nothing away
If you want something you gotta give something
You can't take nothing if you don't give nothing away
If you want something you gotta give something
You can't take nothing if you don't give nothing away
When nothing free would you share with me?
And now for something completely different<start>I've, been pissing in the wind
I chanced a foolish grin, and dribbled on my chin
Now the ground, shifts beneath my feet
The faces that I greet, never know my name
Just give me something
I'll take nothing
Just give me something
I'll take nothing
Now the drought, is crippled by the rain
It hammers on my pain, we lose ourselves again
But all we need, is to a find a place to look
A worm is on its hook, our love which dangles free
Lets watch it swim, against the water's flow
In doubt your courage grows, with no guarantee
Just give me something
I'll take nothing
Jive give me something
I'll take nothing
And so it goes, a morale to the tale
As tortoise catches snail, the strong heart will prevail
It keeps on pumping, it still needs something
Just give it something, I'll take nothing
Just give it something, to keep it pumping
I'll take nothing, just give me something<start>It don't matter anymore
It don't matter much anymore
Cause it gets me down
Lets my feet touch the ground
Won't be lost, but I'm found
Do I care?
Do I fuck
I'm just bearing up
Do I care?
No, I'm high on liquid skin
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It don't matter anymore
It don't matter much anymore

From a faraway place, that's the furthest point from the one I'm living in

A man who's serving time at this very moment
For the crime of armed robbery
It so happened, that at the time of the robbery
Michael, decided to give his female victims
A little enema
Apparently, there was no law against that
But his name lives on
Michael kenyon
The illinois enema bandit!"
The illinois enema bandit
I heard he's on the loose

Bloomington illinois...he has caused some alarm
Just sneakin' around there
From farm to farm
Got a rubberized bag
And a hose on his arm
Lookin' for some rustic co-ed rump
That he just might wanna pump
Lookin' for some rustic co-ed rump
That he just might wanna pump
Lookin' for some rustic co-ed rump
That he just might wanna pump
The illinois enema bandit
One day he'll have to pay
One day he'll have to pay
The police will say, "you're under arrest!"
And the judge would have him for a special guest
The d.a. will order a secret test
And stuff his pudgy little thumbs in the side of his vest
Then they'll put out a call for the jury folks
And the judge would say, "no poo-poo jokes!"
Then they'll drag in the bandit for all to see,
Sayin' "don't nobody have no sympathy...
Hot soap water in the first degree!"
And then the bandit might say, "why is everybody looking' at me? "
Well did you cause this misery?
Well did you cause this kinda misery?
Well did you cause this misery?
Now, one girl shout: "let the bandit be!"
Bandit are you guilty?
Bandit are you guilty? tell me now, what's
Your plea?
Another girl shout: "let the fiend go free!"
Are you guilty? bandit, did you do these deeds?
The bandit say, "it must be just what they all needs..."
"it must be just what they all needs..."
"it must be just what they all needs..."
"it must be just what they all needs..."

Looking for love that never stabbed your heart

I gotta lot of troubles I'm leavin' behind
Oh yes I'm goin' just to see what I can see
I'm gonna get the best of living before living gets the best of me

I gotta find what's goin' on before I leave this earth
Oh yes I'm goin' just to see what I can see
I'm gonna get the best of living before living gets the best of me

And die
And take a stand to change my life
So savage with red desperation
I clench my hands
You draw your claws
A hidden rage consumes my heart
Fueled by years of wasted time
I close my eyes
And tense myself
And screaming
Throw myself in fury over the edge
And into your blood
Tear at flesh
And rip at skin
And smash at doubt
I have to break you
Fury drives my vicious blows
I see you fall but still I strike you
Again and again
Your body falls
The movement is sharp and clear and pure
And gone
I stop and kneel beside you
Drained of everything but pain
Screaming throw myself in fury
Over the edge and into your blood
Kiss you once and see you writhe
Hold you close and hear you cry
Kiss your eyes and finish your life
Kiss your eyes
Finish your life
Again and again
Your body falls
The movement is sharp and clear and pure
And gone
I stop and kneel beside you
Knowing I'll murder you again tonight<start>It happened one night beneath the moon.
When the leaves floated down from the trees.
And the next thing i knew, i was up right beside you,
with my soft green face smiling beside you.
Chorus :
And we danced slowly, waltzed methodically all over the ground,
hurry now before we must return to trees. Your arms of green, you are my
king and i am, i'm the queen of leaves.
The insects were quite confused, and the frogs well they seemed quite amused.
But all i know is you're standing beside me, with your soft green face smiling beside me.
Bridge :
And if you doubted the possibilities , my love, no way.
Look how the trees will surrender their hair so love can have it's way.
And i'm wondering, would you stay with me? We'll leave this place immediately with
nothing in our hands, It doesn't matter, you know, you have to know.<start>He hates the desk, that is grotesque
With all its documents and lists and the screen
Outside the sun, he wants to run away to face the day
Without destroying his way
Hurry up! Don't dare to stop!
Something inside him screams
It's creeping in, it's sweating out
The fear of flying, the fear of dying, a roundabout
It's time to decide, to choose the question mark or to hide
From the fire still burning inside
On the radio, 'though the level's low, he hears The Stones
See how I'm flying it's the call for life
Just pretend your wings are stronger than all the things
That put you down and start your crying
She's through the door of the seventh floor
Her naked body lies dead on the ground
Tears in his eyes asking for the wherefores and the why's
And searching for the pure or at least the nice
Not only on the radio, don't keep the level low, we receive the call
See how I'm flying it's the call for life
Just pretend your wings are stronger than all the things
That put you down and start your crying
See how I'm sailing in the eye of the storm
Leave your fears behind or soon you'll be blind
For the miracle called Life<start>I've said everything I could feel
Think everything I could think
Heard every word without listening
I'm a dick<start>I never feared the rain
Until you turned to me and said
You'd failed again
It makes a perfect day so lame
And leads us halfway to nowhere
So the players have changed
Soon we'll memorize the names
But somehow something's
Never quite the same
Still we'll stake a claim
You can count us in again
And everyone's a winner, baby
Hedge your bets, get set
And maybe, we could be the first
To cross the line
Get up, get set, get ready
Get high, get low, get even
'Cos we're living in inimitable style
Chasing the ultimate prize
You'd make a fine millionaire
It's only natural to celebrate
But someone's got to be there to pay
And we never get there
So take some time on our own
We burn enough alone
Close but still not fully grown
Pulling marrow from a bone
But there's no turning back
So count us in again
And everyone's a winner, baby
Hedge your bets, get set
And maybe, we could be the first
To cross the line
Everyone's a winner, baby
Everyone's a winner, baby
Going back to the old house
The marigolds just go to show
That some of us should
Never have left home
But see, I'm still counting
Another flash in the pan
And she burn instant forming tan
It seems to grow on me
Taking inches from a mile, no change there
But I'm all for throwing it on the line
'Cos everyone's a winner, baby
Hedge your bets, get set
And maybe, we could be the first
To cross the line
Get up, get set, get ready
Get high, get low, get even
'Cos we're living in inimitable style
Chasing the ultimate prize
Oh, everyone's a winner, baby

Oh, everyone's a winner, baby

Everyone's a winner, baby, baby<start>Put it in your pocket, leave it in your shoe
Plug it in your socket, flush it down the loo
Hey baby, show me something new
Put it in your hat, put it in your can
Feed it to your cat, share it with your band
Hey baby, help me understand
Well they're fighting in the kitchen and they're wagging in the hall
Up against the dark and up against the wall
Why don't you meet me in the bottom baby? Bring your running shoes<start>I can whistle while I work but it doesnt make it better
I can live a lonely winter and pretend Im all right
Or let my true side show for the world to see
Cause if they buy into gimmicks, they dont know the real me
Lately, Ive been watching you. Girl, I love the way you move
You dance with the boys, then leave the love struck high
On the dance floor they all fight for your attention
While Im plotting a scheme to steal the competition, girl
You swallowed up all my pride, but honey youre worth the fight
Oh honey, youre worth the fight
Let tonight be the night that the last dance will win you over
On the final song youll get swept off your feet
The crowd circles where you stand, and theyll watch as I take your hand
Let tonight be the night that you save the last dance for me
A heavy-hitter go-getter is how I gotta deliver as a steadfast contender
But Im weak in the knees
Cause youre a real life girl in a dream girls body
Trailed by boys who keep up like paparazzi
And you, you dont even know who I am, but Im playing my cards to win
Honey, Im playing my cards to win<start>I'm sittin' on my suitcase just outside of town
Watching my tears make little funnies all around
Waitin' for that big ole bus to come my way
For I'm going to anywhere USA
No I don't care where that old great Dog is going
Just as long as it takes me so far away
Mister driver what's the fare how much do I pay
To go to anywhere USA
I had a love they told me she'd always stay home
I come in every bar in town she's mighty well known
So big wheels keep on rolling take me far away
Yeah to anywhere USA
No I don't care where that old great Dog is going...<start>Throw me into the water I'm not afraid to begin again
To wash away the red red clay
Covering my body from the deep deep grave
I've been digging through a dark dark hour
A low low ditch to build the highest tower
There's a blue light upon the ocean floor
So I've been diving down to be made pure
To be reborn
Take me down to the Devil I'm not afraid of a little sin
To burn away these dead dead days
And poison my sorrow 'til it slips away
Out of my heart and out of my hands
Through my fingers and onto the land
The high tide comes to carry out to sea
The hell we raise so we can be cured
We can be free
Send me down to the bottom of the good earth where I can see
Where I can hear the river run clear
Cool cool water down to drown my fear
Come to see the shore everyone's waiting
To be made pure to be redone
Come to the shore and jump right in
To the blue water where we can sleep
And soon begin again<start>Si Ã¨ risolto
In un semplice nulla di fatto
La mia specie, Ã¨ sempre piÃ¹ ipocrita e non ha logica
Ho guardato la foto di un mio vecchio amico
Ormai perso, la prima ruga che ho sull'anima

La sua stessa voglia di sorridere, di sorridere

you smell like nicotine and you're drunk and horny
hate to see you go, but love to watch you walk away
you won't be gone for long
wicked woman you're so mad
what is wrong in your head?
wicked woman you're so mad
what is wrong in your head?
you're a fiend and you know it
you silly fiends you really show it
you've waited for hours and there's nothing left to give you
leave your footprints in the sand
you breathe the air and you know it
and when you sit and stare you can't control it
take a look at the photograph
and then the tears run down my window
and I'm the one guy here that understands
wicked woman you're so mad
what is wrong in your head?
wicked woman you're so mad
what is wrong in your head?
you're a fiend and you know it
you silly fiends you really show it
you've waited for hours and there's nothing left to give you
leave your footprints in the sand
the same routine, the same old story
you smell like nicotine and you're drunk and horny
hate to see you go, but love to watch you walk away
you won't be gone for long
you wicked woman
you wicked woman
you wicked woman
you wicked woman
you wicked woman<start>There's a poet in me that remembers
And there's an honesty in every word
There's a dancer that feels her own beat
And there's a daughter who loves
There's a sinner in my bones
And there's a joker in my head
There are secrets in my soul
And there are sorries that I have never said
But there's a time to dance
Time to laugh
Time to cry
Time to go
Time to grieve
Time to come
Oh, I still got time to cope
Time to hope
Time to play
Time to grow
But for now I gotta walk alone
I gotta walk alone
There's a tight rope that I've been walking
There's a daisy in my hair
There's a heartbreak that has taught me
Of what is raging
And there's only love and fear
There's a sadness in my confessions
There's a hyena howling at the moon
And there's a gypsy in me that keeps on roaming
And there's a an anger as I get closer to the truth
But there's a time to dance
Time to laugh
Time to cry
Time to go
Time to grieve
Time to come
Oh, I still got time to cope
Time to hope
Time to play
Time to grow
But for now I gotta walk alone
I gotta walk alone
I gotta walk alone
I've got to walk alone
But for now I gotta walk alone
Oh, I hear the thunder but I won't back down
A soldier marches through the wrong side of town
I'm gonna love you until I bleed
And that's the story of me
I gotta walk alone
If they say time is everything
There's a time to dance
Time to laugh
Time to cry
Time to go
Time to grieve
Time to come
Oh, I still got time to cope
Time to hope
Time to play
Time to grow
Now I gotta walk alone
I've got to walk alone
I've got to walk alone
I gotta walk alone
For now I gotta walk alone<start>so you want to become a hero
stop the world -- become a hero
we just can't find one anywhere
can't find one anywhere
so you're thinking you're a victim
stop the world cause you're a victim
well, you can find one anywhere
you can find one everywhere
life's just a hit or miss
all the time, just a hit or miss
sometimes you take a swing and miss
a swing and a miss
well sometimes, we take a swing and hit!
Now you're thinking about the future
try to picture some kind of future
you just can't see one anywhere -- can't see it anywhere
well we need to find us a hero
can you tell me where are the heroes
who can clean up everywhere
hey g.i. joe, where are you now?
And if I could count the times
that I looked up to the sky
and asked someone to save me. . .<start>Milloinkaan emme harhaan astuneet
Meidt vain johdatettiin vrn kohteeseen
Valkoinen huntusi on tahrittu taas
Pime kulkee sinun vaatteissas
Paha ei juossut karkuun kuin nurkan taa
S puit sen niin kauniisti
Se palasi kotiin
Hallaa peltipurkissa
Hallaa kaupan tiskilt
Hallaa miten vaan, aina samaa
Hallaa sinun vieress
Kuitenkaan emmme liikaa toivoneet
Meidt vain houkuteltiin vrn veneeseen
Suloiset kasvosi on peitetty taas
Pime kulkee sinun vaatteissas
Paha ei koskaan pakoon halunnutkaan
S puit sen niin kauniisti
Se palasi kotiin taas
Hallaa peltipurkissa
Hallaa kaupan tiskilt
Hallaa miten vaan, aina samaa
Hallaa sinun vieress<start>I've thought it through & I think you're right
And you're not missing much
There's something pure
That you can't hold against a simple touch
So many choices and the pressure
We all bring to bear
Your strength works miracles
And touches those who try to care
I believe in you
And I hope you see it through
Your resolve is inspiration in my life
It takes a lot now
So few who feel the same
When it means enough
Not to give it away now
Finding it hard
Not to think in terms of yesterday
Finding it strange
That somebody else could feel that way
It must be hard sometimes
To stand behind your chastity
And I wish that I could be the one
But it's not me I'll never set you free
Hold on because you've got a lot to believe in<start>Martha, my dear
Though I spend my days in conversation, please
Remember me
Martha, my love
Don't forget me
Martha, my dear
Hold your head up, you silly girl
Look what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl
Take a good look around you
Take a good look you're bound to see
That you and me were meant to be
With each other
Silly girl
Hold you're hand out, you silly girl
See what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl<start>I had girl, I knew she grew, became a woman
Now I think that she teaches at one of the schools downtown
We used to roll the windows down and play the music loud
Smoking out in her car, lost in west Omaha
And wed get drunk and kiss, our bodies twist like shoe laces
And we never came untied, I guess you were just my type
You know that summer never stopped, I still pretend Im there
Bands in the living room, the neighbors aint never cared
So when I sat behind the drum set
Your heartbeats what I tried to play
With kick and snares so careless, not in time
So you got ahead of me
And I guess Im still dragging behind
I had a friend who changed his name but couldnt change himself
Never quite figured out how to do with what life had dealt
He put a needle in his arm to calm his handsome hell
Who would have imagined it? Couldve worked out so well
Now he's a shape that moves like echoes through my empty room
And theres a voice that speaks like someones right behind me
I turned around and found exactly what you would expect
Clothes I left on my floor, the papers piled on my desk
But where the ink is where the cause effects whats meant by it
The story is incomplete, the pictures left unfinished
So I am writing my own ending
Ill let my pen bleed black or blue
And I will color in the meaning
It will be gold and green and true
And Ill learn to love my new discovered proof
Ill be grateful for this day
I'll be grateful for each day to come<start>Please don't leave me wanting more
I hope you never die
These's no need to say why
Just promise that you'll try
To give me all you can
I'll never ask for more
There's a new life through the door
A cradle rocks and falls
Cements the melody
Our troubles passing
Through decaying, simple times
I'll tread on your tail with pride
C'est maintenant decide
I've nothing better
Please don't leave me wanting more
I hope you never die
There's no need to say why
Just promise that you'll try<start>When all the pages turn to black
There is nothing left for me or you
And in the blanket of the sky
Oh you, you take me home again
And the sun is setting on your eyes
Touching me, I don't know
Oh, help me
I will wait for you
Sinking in this place
I will follow you
Don't forget, forget my name
The world a perfect shade of red
Tomorrow maybe I'll forget, I'm blue
And when you someday soon return
I'll set a match to every word from you<start>I get down with music and guitars
I fool around with all kinds of fast cars
It takes you baby to keep my motor running
I smoke the tires and watch the rubber burn
It takes your fire to make my wheels turn
Make my blood run hot and keeps my heart a humming
But you're love don't take a backseat to nothing
Temptation always knocking
Get three behind me 'cause I ain't stopping
Baby you're all I need and whole lot more
Rockin' and rollin' out here on the fast lane
It can get crazy, downright insane
Burning down the highway to your front door
But you're love don't take a backseat to nothing
My baby's really somthing
She keeps my motor running
Her love don't take a backseat
Temptation always knocking
Get three behind me 'cause I ain't stopping
Baby you're all I need and whole lot more
But you're love don't take a backseat to nothing<start>Hey

Si es que hay algo que ver

Desaparecido
Desaparecido
Como lluvia en el rÃ­o
Me he perdido en ti
Ya no existo
Fuera de tus ojos
Ya no vivo

Escondido
En las cosas mÃ¡s bellas
Siguiendo el rastro
De paisajes de humo
Desaparecido
Desaparecido
No busques me, he ido
Con la noche negra
Desaparecido
Desaparecido
Me he convertido en nada
Porque fallaba todo
Como lÃ¡grimas de lluvia en el tejado
Como pÃ¡jaros con rumbo equivocado

Say that I'm dead
Having swallowed my leg
And come to the bedroom again
Let us begin
Shrinking the walls
And counting our ears
In sweat, as we crawl
Get me to the wilderness on time
When I look round your eyes
There's a space at the side
Where ten more eyes could hide
And they'd squeal when they learned what I mean
Madame obscene
Sweating skulls clean
And my genuine celticness shines, oops!
It just struck me blind
I'm such a spiritual guy
Get me to the wilderness and
Bury my leg in some bog
And tell me all about right and wrong
And tell me life is serious
And zip up your dress
And get me to the wilderness on time<start>(Buildings burn, people die.. but real love is forever)
she enters the room so calm and compulse
she's got one thing on her mind
as she makes her approach
and her lipstick, it glistens like the moonlight
and one kiss will bring you to your knees tonight
(chorus)
hello, i know you're wasting your time
hello, i know she's tearing out your spine
and if this keeps up you know she'll destroy your mind
and i'll be waiting..
now that she's got you right where she wants you
she'll take everything, she's got nothing to prove
and her lipstick is stained across your collar
and one kiss you'll swear that you love her..
you'll swear that you love her
(chorus)
hello, i know you're wasting your time
hello, i know she's tearing out your spine
and if this keeps up you know she'll destroy your mind
and i'll be waiting..

The Voice, the choice, who will you serve
The Life, the Blood, the tree the Love
I've paid my dues, below and above
The race, the prize, the in outside
The fire, the crier, the flames expire
Abounding in hope the anchor my soul
Jesus the Christ, All enter the light
The first resurrection, mercy and truth
Remember the life imparted to you
They come they go like a river they flow
The first, the last, the future, the past
YOU CAN HEAR ME
YOU CAN HEAR ME
YOU CAN HEAR ME
'cause I have a microphone!<start>Sun going up,
Making its rounds
It keeps on moving,
Painting the town
Before you know it,
She's sinking low
So tell me something . . .
Something I don't already know
I don't know?
Toward the south,
Then turning north
Whirlwind spinning,
On a circular course
The answer my friend,
Returns to blow
So tell me something . . .
Something I don't already know
I don't know?
Tell me something
I don't know?
As for the wise men who pursue
Their knowledge
Same as the fool, free falling
Prey to folly
Can only one fate befall
Them both
So tell me something . . .
[Chorus:]
If every song been sung,
Under the sun
What's left for me then,
Eat drink and have fun
It must go on, as for the show
So tell me something . . .<start>I'm staring out into the night, trying to hide the pain
I'm going to the place where love
And feeling good don't ever cost a thing
And the pain you feel's a different kind of pain
Well, I'm going home, back to the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from, no, I think you got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old
So I'm going home, well I'm going home
The miles are getting longer, it seems, the closer I get to you
I've not always been the best man or friend for you
But your love remains true and I don't know why
You always seem to give me another try
So I'm going home, back to the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from, no, I think you got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old
Be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it all
You just might get it all and then some you don't want
Be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it all
You just might get it all, yeah
Oh, well I'm going home, back to the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from, no, I think you got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old
I said these places and these faces are getting old
So I'm going home, I'm going home<start>Got lost in the kerosene sun
I'll make it back before the daylight comes
Time is short and time is swift
Got to focus who I spend it with
I wait for signs and I wait for maps
I don't stop and I won't come back
This is the time to decide what's right
This is the time of our lives
This is the time to realize ourselves
Watch us come
Stand up take a bite
Whatever gets you through the night
Stand up, stand up for your mistakes
Don't give in to bad breaks
Stand up, stand up and respond
Out to the future and beyond
She tied me up left me in knots
We have words but not for stop
I met a girl she was in my sleep
I had to beg that she wouldn't leave
I wish for days I could have again
I wish so bad I could see my friends
This is the time to decide what's right
This is the time of our lives
Stand up take a bite
Whatever get you through the night
Stand up, stand up for your mistakes
Don't give in to bad breaks
Stand up, stand up and respond
Out to the future and beyond (and beyond)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come around
You've got to hang on to yourself
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come around
You've got to hang on to yourself
You've got to hang on to yourself
You've got to hang on to yourself
We're electric
We're invincible
We're unstoppable
For subordinates
We're electric
We're invincible
We're unstoppable
We're subordinates
We're subordinates
Stand up take a bite
Whatever gets you through the night
Stand up, stand up for your mistakes
Don't give in to bad breaks
Stand up, stand up and respond
Out to the future and beyond
Stand up
Stand up
Stand up
Stand up
Stand up
Whatever gets you through the night

For subordinates
We're electric
We're invincible
We're unstoppable
We're subordinates<start>When you come back to your senses
Your heart overcomes your pride
I'll be here with an open mind
Here to break your fall from misery
You expect me to love just like you
Even though you won't admit that
You sink your teeth into something
You figure it'll come biting back
But I am not made to tag along
When everything seems wrong
And I still can breath when you are gone
When everything seems wrong to you
I don't know if we'd be better off
Living our own separate lives
Talking every once or twice
Whenever we need each other
I can't picture another arm around you
Wonder how I would react
Would I scream and shout in anger,
Or would I maintain some tact?
[Chorus]
You know that you're my best friend
That kind of love will never run out
You know more about me than I know
Things I'd never dream of showing
But I can't change the way I'm feeling
And I'm not asking for miles of room
Just a little time to fill my tank up
Before I run on back to you
[Chorus]
When will you come back to your senses?<start>, ,

I'm gonna watch it burn
I'm gonna stand out in the road
This old house is burning down tonight
Front porch, back door, well-worn wooden floor
All agree that since you're gone
The TV, sofa bed, brand new stereo
Just can't seem to get along
They'll all be ashes by the dawn
Your Beatles, my Stones, your My Aim Is True
Staying up late every night
With your cigarettes, Jim Beam, gallon of gasoline
Did someone say they need a light
You'll see my love for you burns bright
So send your sheriff to arrest me
He'll have to cross the county line
I'll get the devil to defend me
I was only burnin' what was mine
Black shirt, black boots, favorite pair of blue jeans
I saved my coat, I saved my hat
But your white dress, gold band, silver frame and photograph
Stayed behind the welcome mat
I never really liked your cat
This old house is burning down tonight
All Halloween orange and chimney red
This old house is burning down tonight
You're gonna say My God! when you see it on the news
And by the time the ceiling hits the ground
I'll smoke my tires and leave this town<start>Instrumental<start>No queda nada por decir,
He mostrado todo lo que hay en ti,
No quiero pensar cual sera tu fin.
Te crees tan tan especial,
Siempre igual a todas las demÃ¡s,
Nadie te enseÃ±o lo que es el amor,
Andas por la vida sin direcciÃ³n.
Aparentas ser tan buena,
La mitad es pura mierda,
Vive para los demÃ¡s,
Pero yo se que estas muriendo en soledad...
Oh dime cuantas veces lo hiciste
Tan solo por amor why no tan solo para divertirte
Pasaran los dÃ­as,
Pasan horas,
Pasaran semanas
why tal vez tu sigues igual
Como si nada de esto te importara
(nada de esto te importara)
Sales con Ã©l why el es feliz
Tan poco le importa igual que a ti,
Quien lo iba a pensar que seria tu fin.
Se cree tan tan especial,
Gastando el dinero de su papÃ¡
Why no sabe de amor,le gusta el reggaeton
Why no vale tres pesos ese cabrÃ³n.
Te trata como a una reina,
Sabe para que eres buena,
Viven para los demÃ¡s
Pero yo se que estas muriendo en soledad...
Oh dime cuantas veces lo hiciste
Tan solo por amor why no tan solo para divertirte
Pasaran los dÃ­as,

Juntos moriran en soledad...

Your alibi will never hold up to mine
Standing up when paralyzed
Pull the cloak over your eyes
It aint enough to be a mountain tall
Adding up, so name the price
Spent your lot to turn on a dime
Remove your mask to make a curtain call
Something's calling me out to the boulevard
My thoughts need cages until the morning
When night it rises like the tide
I feel I'm underneath I'm drowning in nothing at all
Make amends before you start the fight
Finding out why you should sleep at night
The blood will boil then solidify
You better see this, you won't believe it
You can't avoid the way they perceive you to be
They're still behind you
They're catching up to hold you to the back of the line<start>What lurks behind the minds of men,
The switch is triggered once again.
A silent rage makes the front page
A work of art so neatly done homicide
Cannot decide was it accident was it suicide
She's just a face without a name never made
It home.
They found her car down by
The lake the bottom was raked
The news says it's a classic case, she disappeared
Without a trace
A witness reward but nothing is heard but
Run rabbit run, hawk in sky hides in
The sun
Run for you life he'll take it away
Run run run fast away.
Don't look behind you'll stun if you look in his
Eyes
Run for your life he'll take it away
Run run run fast away
Defective unit on the street tonight
He hunts the weak and clips it wings
The moon ignites a flaming raging child
An empty soul is running wild.<start>Son las 2 de la maÃ±ana

No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby
I ain't gonna cry no
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave girl
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably you'll be back again
Cause ya know in your heart babe
Our love will never end no
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Girl don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby
I know that you'll be back girl
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder oooohhh
I know that, you'll be right back, babe
Ooooh! baby believe me it's only a matter of time
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Girl don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my my baby....
You'll always be a part of me (you will always be)
I'm part of you indefinitely
Girl don't you know you can't escape me

Always be my baby<start>Not enough
Never too much
Woman look just like love
Rolling stone
Gathers no moss
Leave a trail of busted stuff
I know shes gonna leave my broken heart behind her
I take what shes given up
I know shes gonna leave my broken heart behind her
I take what shes given up
Yeah
Sweet sugar lips
Push from her hips
You know you look just like love
Without a care
She floats above
She got me down and pinned up in love
Chorus:
Still the one, still the one, still the one for me
When she move
She move so cool
She got me feel just like a fool
But inside, is where the devil hides
The woman look just like love
Chorus:
Still the one, still the one, still the one for me
Ohhhh
Chorus<start>Devlin, community outcast
And this one's for all the characters
That have been forgotten at the present time
I represent for the jobless
That have been made redundant
That have got four kids
And don't know how to fund them
Ever since the wife and the husband
Both lost their jobs at the office in London
Now they feel financially trapped
Now are locked with the rats in a dingy old dungeon
Take this young father of two
Signing on and the government
Says that his family are spongers
He's like, "Damn man
We ain't got a penny or a pound"
Let alone money for milk
And nappies and trainers and jumpers
He got taken off site 'cause it's cheaper
To pay Europeans to labor in numbers
How's he gonna take care of his younger's
I represent for the people
Let down by a nation
And left in the streets where it's evil
Little kids surrounded
By knives and heroin needles
I represent for the people
Let down by a nation
And left on the streets where it's evil
Community outcast, cold, tired and feeble
I represent for the homeless
Let down by a nation
More interested in war and invasion
When children are sleeping at railway stations
No home or money
They wish they could phone their mummy
To put a hot meal in their tummy
So at night when the temperature drops
I'm asking you remember what you got
These kids go home to a cardboard box
They're the soul survivors
Warming their hands
With their flickering flame of their lighters
All their life they've been frightened
On the streets with their head down
Knowing deep down inside
That they've really been let down
By a country that's crippled
And I thought mankind was supposed to be civil
I represent for the people
Let down by a nation
And left in the streets where it's evil
Little kids surrounded
By knives and heroin needles
I represent for the people
Let down by a nation
And left on the streets where it's evil
Community outcast, cold, tired and feeble
I represent single mums, all alone on their own
Tying to put food in the mouths of her two sons
And the fathers gone, there's no cash flow
Lack of income
But that's just the way it is
She counts fifteen needles
Pushing her pram on the way to the lift
And this is where Brown said
It's safe to live and raise kids
She finds her way out of the block
With two kids in a pram
And a rip and a stain in her top
She goes to sign on
Just to maintain the little she's got
For her kids sake
They'll never seen a decent life
But they can dream and they'll sleep tonight
They've been hung out and left to dry
The kids are in bed, mums left to cry
I represent for the people
Let down by a nation
And left in the streets where it's evil
Little kids surrounded
By knives and heroin needles
I represent for the people
Let down by a nation
And left on the streets where it's evil
Community outcast, cold, tired and feeble
I represent for the old folk that live alone
No family or kids at home
And all he wants is someone to speak to
But nobody thinks to phone
Sits at home in the dark, no electric
Since his wife passed, he can't accept it
He feels isolated, neglected
And now his council flats infested
So he goes to the shop for his papers
With his stick and he falls in the mud
The people around him all pulled him up
But to him that's just a reminder
He's old and he's weak with no one to love
I sees clouds up above
Another bad day in the diary
An old man one of many
Killed by society, strangled quietly
I represent for the people
Let down by a nation
And left in the streets where it's evil
Little kids surrounded
By knives and heroin needles
I represent for the people
Let down by a nation
And left on the streets where it's evil
Community outcast, cold, tired and feeble
I represent for the people
Let down by a nation
And left in the streets where it's evil
Little kids surrounded
By knives and heroin needles
I represent for the people
Let down by a nation
And left on the streets where it's evil
Community outcast, cold, tired and feeble<start>VERSE 1

Faces never seen,

The darkest of demons are hidden

Impulses and thoughts torn

Echo of light fingers

Now's it's time I put my foot on down
Oh baby, my love don't seem the same
No, no
Well they say that love is all you need
To heal the world
Plus a trillion billion dollars
Have you heard
That President Bush, Santa Claus and Green Goblin
Sadam Hussein, Spiderman and Bin Laden
Britney Spears, Jesus and the whole cast of Friends
Met for brunch last week
To solve the world's problems
Would've called on me
Oh baby, my love don't seem the same
Well if they called on my name
Don't you know I'd do it
Shine my signal all over Gotham
I'd be true
It's my distinct pleasure
To come down from my grass
Get off my front porch
And save your asses
And in the nick of time
Oh baby, my love don't seem the same
Well change has come over me
My muscles blown
So I freestyled my ass across the U.S.A.
Solve the economy, the homeless problem
Save what's left of the environment
Create jobs, for everybody to be doing something
They want to be doing
Yeah
But if you can't do smack
Then you better do something
'Cause this is the time
When you so can't do nothing
That means you and you and you and you
And me too
Oh baby
Then I fly overseas
And set all the slaves free
From prostitution, sweat shop, child labor
South America, the problems in the Middle East
Make a sun power car
We don't have to fight in oil fields
I'll take all the troops back
From wherever they roam
And wherever their fightin'
And whatever side their on
And I'll send on the first plane
Home to their moms
And we could make coffee tables
Out of all these bombs
And save the whales
And the pygmy marmosets too
Oh baby
Well all this seems kinda hard
But it really ain't nothin'
All you got to do is
Get bit by a spider or something
We could change the world
In a week or a day
And if you got problems
Man, I sweep 'em away
You find yourself in a world full of trouble
Just call on G. Love
Your superhero brother

I'll be there

Middle of July
The choir was a singin'
'Bout the sweet by and by
Everybody was a swayin'
And sweatin' in the heat
We all bowed our heads down
As the preacher took his seat
My sister and my brother stood next to my mother
In the quiet at the close of the verse
That's when daddy cut the big one
At the Horn Lake Mississippi Missionary Baptist Church
My sister rolled her eyes back
My brother bit his lip
My cousin just behind us
Whispered, "Hey, who let it rip?"
I stuck my face in my shirtsleeve
Stared down at my shoes
Lord, you could hear a pin drop
As we stood there in the pew
Heads were turnin', eyes were burnin'
Momma stuck her nose in her purse
After daddy cut the big one
At the Horn Lake Mississippi Missionary Baptist Church
He cut the big one
It was a stinker
Then he broke the silence
With a snicker
And us kids started laughin'
'Til I thought we was all gonna burst
After daddy cut the big one
At the Horn Lake Mississippi Missionary Baptist Church
He said, "The devil made me do it"
Momma said it was the liverwurst
And that's why daddy cut the big one
At the Horn Lake Mississippi Missionary Baptist Church<start>Joy to the world! The Lord is come.
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart
Prepare Him room
And Saints and angels sing
And Saints and angels sing
And Saints and Saints and angels sing
Joy to the world, the Saviour reigns
Let Saints their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, Repeat, the sounding joy
Joy to the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders and wonders of His love
No more will sin and sorrow grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He'll come and make the blessings flow
Far as the curse was found,
Far as the curse was found,
Far as, far as the curse was found.
He rules the world with truth and grace,
And gives to nations proof
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love;
And wonders of His love;
And wonders, wonders of His love.
Rejoice! Rejoice in the Most High,
While Israel spreads abroad
Like stars that glitter in the sky,
And ever worship God,
And ever worship God,
And ever, and ever worship God.<start>Hey
Put the pain that you have in the back of your mind
Wait, I wanna wipe away all the tears in your eyes
Cause I got that rhythm in the moves that'll make you hot
I'm the only one that gets your heart to stop
Please believe me, that you're the only one I want
But every time I get closer, you push me away
I don't get it
You said you want me closer to you
And every line I step over, you tell me to wait another minute
You sure don't make this easy to do
Maybe you need to get a little bit closer to me
Why are you crying about the bad times in the past
Try to take the good that you got and make it last
Cause you got that rhythm in the moves that'll make me hot
You're the only one that gets my heart to stop
Please believe me, that you're the only one I want
But every time I get closer, you push me away
I don't get it
You said you want me closer to you
And every line I step over, you tell me to wait another minute
You sure don't make this easy to do
Maybe you need to get a little bit closer
Closer to me<start>Oh new day. Wash my face and wipe these scars away
Clear my thoughts. Imagine the last Empire's demise
Oh new dawn. At last I have died and reborn
The rays burnt through my shell
My mission is summoning me
From the depth of earth I crawled
From Heaven's heights I've descended
The last one to know them all
The first to be rejected
Under cover of white light we meet at the first step
Digging graves for a dying world
In the river, in thin air I am floating. Hovering
Following lessons of past mistakes
Gathering knowledge as I grow stronger
I am the poisoned rain from a darkened sky
I am the burning water and the orphans' cry
I live in the ones who have fallen only to reach for the stars
I am the desert wasteland; I am the spring run dry<start>The Carter family lived next door for almost 14 years
With Gwen and I inseperatable from rag dolls through brassieres
Then Gwen began to bore me with her giggles and her fears
The day the Carters moved away, I had to fake my tears
I told new friends Gwen Carter had become a silly pest
And then I found I missed her more than I'd ever have guessed
Grandma used to nag at me to straighten up my spine
To act respectful and read good books
To take care of what was mine
I hated being criticized and asking her permission
So what if her advise was wise, It always hurt to listen
I didn't cry when Granny died, she made me so depressed
And then I found I missed her more than I'd ever have guessed
You used to make me moan in bed, but that can't be enough
My friends complained your jokes were crude,
Your manners were too rough
Don't know just what I wanted, but I know I wanted more
Someone smooth, presentable, to blend with my decor
And now at night I think of how you grinned when you undressed
And I find I miss you more than I'd ever have guessed.<start>Oochy woochy, yeah baby
Oochy woochy, yeah baby<start>[Intro]
[Music: D.Cavanagh, Arranged: Les Smith]<start>I'm trying to control myself
So please don't stand in my way

There's a climax coming in my way

Shattered by your smile
And I'm not very fond of you, and your lies

The summer's over it's the golden rule
And now I'm coming out to play

So important to me

In reflection I'll see you again.
Approach me, soak me.
Faith, faith, breathe.
'Cause it's here, it's where the air is clear,
Where far off things could be quite near.
No repairs are needed, just a spark.
I'm interested, you've always been a subject, that I could learn.
Splendid hils, unconquerable mountains.
Climb, don't ever turn back.
Seed, seed, grow.

Just shit talking unimpressed.
For speaking up and out above the murmur of the crowd.
Cause it's nothing special.
It's basic fundamental.
Just four guys concerned trying to drum up some right questions right now.
A room full of people.
The whole worlds in their hands.
Why's not the whole world concerned?
This is your world to you know.
Stand up for something more than.
Sitting right back down.
I'm not afraid to get up and communicate this message to you because it cats me alive.
And I think that's why you only want to watch me sit and scream.
That doesn't justify what happened here.
What happened here?
You don't know how it feels (granted I don't know how it feels either most of the time).
I'll see you in a smoke filled coffee shop one day.
I hope that we can talk what we've been through.
The most donuts per capita per idiot.
I'll never forget.
Taste my lungs bleed again.
I bit my own hand off when I realized it helped to feed.
At the end of the day I know how it feels to want the end.
One more cigarette.
You never seemed to understand.
It was just about respect.
This truly ain't no mecca man.
This place is truly fucked.
We built it up and watched it fall.
And survived with those we trust.
All we were earching for was someone or something to believe in.
That's why we got each other. Cause when they knock one of us down.
We'll come together underground.
And try to conquer the world
The stars and stripes charred black.
When done right, art should attack.<start>Hold me, touch me, let me know
I'm breathing, I'm bleeding, I'm not alone
Finger-painting down your cheek

She knows what she needs
I need what she knows, maybe

And your friends will move away
So think about what you leave in stone
'Cause the memories, the memories will stay
I think I'll go on holiday
Change my name and run away
What is "honest" if your heart is
Not satisfied with the man inside it
'Cause if you don't have faith in you
There's not much else a boy can do
So give me a smile
Give me a smile
If you need some help from me
All I've got is sympathy
'Cause I, cause I don't believe what I've been told
But a foolish heart is worth its weight in gold
Don't just keep on turning just to turn
Can't teach a boy what he don't wanna learn
So give me a smile
Give me a smile

With the city on your back
Wondering if it's worth it all
To find love in the cracks of rock and roll
So give me a smile
Give me a smile
So come on and give me a smile<start>[Chorus]
Daniel, Daniel and the sacred harp,
Dancing through the clover.
Daniel, Daniel would you mind,
If I look it over.
I heard of this famous harp years ago back in my home town
But I sure never thought old Daniel be the one to come and bring it around
Tell me Daniel how the harp came into your possession.
Are you one of the chosen few who will march in the the procession?
And Daniel said,
The sacred harp was handed down, from father unto son,
And me not being related, I could never be the one.
So I saved up all my silver, and took it to a man,
Who said he could deliver the harp, straight into my hand.
Three years I waited patiently,
Till he returned with the harp from the sea of Galilee.
He said there is one more thing I must ask,
But not of personal greed.
But I wouldn't listen I just grabbed the harp,
And said take what you may need.
Now Daniel looked quite satisfied, and the harp it seemed to glow.
But the price that Daniel had really paid, he did not even know.
Back to his brother he took his troubled mind.
And he said dear brother I'm in a bind.
But the brother would not hear his tale,
He said Old Daniel's gonna land in jail.
So to his father Daniel did run,
And he said oh father what have I done.
His father said son you've given in, you know you won your harp,
But you lost in sin.
Then Daniel took the harp and went high on the hill,
And he blew across the meadow like a whippoorwill.
He played out his heart just the time to pass,
But as he looked to the ground, he noticed no shadow did he cast.
[Chorus]<start>I'll tell you a story, what happened a long time-a
And it won't happen any more, more, more, more, more, more
You tell that girl everything that you wanted to
And then she wanted a little bit more, more, more, more, more, more
[Chorus]
Girls, girls are, they are so unpredictable
You can't believe what they tell you
Unpredictable, you gotta throw it away
Girls are so unpredictable, bull, bull, bull, bull, bull
You tell that girl everything that you wanted to
And then she wanted a little bit more, more, more, more, more, more
You tell her you don't want to see her pretty little face again, so
You don't go knocking at my door, door, door, door, door, door

You tell that girl everything that you wanted to
And then she wanted a little bit more, more, more, more, more, more
You tell her you don't want to see her pretty little face again, so
You don't go knocking at my door, door, door, door, door, door
[Chorus]<start>It happened oh so fast it takes me by surprise, it took me where I haven't been, way back it happened when I looked into your eyes I know it hurts to make a sin. Don't tell me how you don't expect and uprising I won't go, I can't explain that someone deep inside of me told me so. It happened oh so fast it makes me wanna lie, lights in my eyes they're sort of dim, I pictured feeling when my temperature it rised, sights when your high above the rim. Don't tell me how you don't expect a side effect i've hit low, I can't explain why someone deep inside of me told me so. YEAH!!!! didn't go my way it didn't fly. YEAH!!!! damn you'd never know unless you tried.<start>You ought to ask Mr. Mistoffelees
The original conjuring cat
Please, listen to me...
And don't scoff
All his inventions are of his own bat
There's no such cat
In the metropolis
He holds all the Pitan monopolies
For performing surprising illusions
And creating eccentric confusions
The greatest magicians have something to learn
From Mr. Mistoffelees's conjuring turn
And we all say
"Oh, well I never, was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees"
"Oh, well I never, was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees"
He is quiet and small, he is black
From the ears to the tip of his tail
He can creep through the tiniest crack
He can walk on the narrowest rail
He can pick any card from a pack
He is equally cunning with dice
He is always deceiving you into believing
That he's only hunting for mice
He can play any trick with a cork
Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste
If you look for a knife or a fork
And you think it was merely misplaced
You have seen it one moment
And then it is gone
But you find it next week
Lying out on the lawn
And you'll all say
"Oh, well I never, was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees"
"Presto!"
"Oh, well I never, was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees"
His manner is vague and aloof
You would think there was nobody shyer
But his voice has been heard on the roof
When he was curled up by the fire
And he's sometimes been heard by the fire
When he was about on the roof
At least we all heard that somebody purred
Which is uncontestable proof
Of his singular magical powers
And I've known the family to call
Him in from the garden for hours
When he was asleep in the hall
And not long ago
This phenomenal cat
Produced seven kittens
Right out of a hat
And we'll all say
"Oh, well I never, was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees"
"Oh, well I never, was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees"
"Oh, well I never, was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees"
"Oh, well I never, was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees"
"Oh, well I never, was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees"
"Oh, well I never, was there ever
A cat so clever as magical
Mr. Mistoffelees"
Ladies and gentlemen
I give you the magical, Marvelous Mr. Mistoffelees<start>Columbine my frail design
I see you see me standing on my own
Is it you that I'm walking through
Should I retrace my point of view
I'm left in clouded dreams of finding who
Not columbine
Just incase you're my disguise
I found yourself to my surprise
I'm on the ground
And it's harlequin who fix me up
Who catches you
Who wanishes me
From finding who
You are<start>(Bob Dylan)
I got on a train
I can't buy a thrill
Well I been up all night, child
Leaning on a window sill
But if I die on top of the hill
If I don't make it I-I know my baby will
Walk over.
Who look good
All shining through the trees
Why don't that baby look good, ma
When it's banging down the double E
Why don't the sun look good
Going down over the sea
Cause I got me a good one
And she's a-coming after me.
But every time that she coming
There goes fuel exhaust
I wanna tell everybody but I
I could not get across
I wanna be your lover, babe
I don't wanna be your boss
Don't say I never warned you
When your train gets lost.<start>Grab your gun, time to go to Hell
I'm no hero, guilty as charged
Search and destroy
Found my faith, living in sin
I'm no Jesus, but neither are you my friend
I'm a whore, a birth of broken dreams
This simple answer is never what it seems
A million little pieces we've broken into
A million little pieces I've stolen from you
Search and destroy
Search and destroy
(Woah oh oh woah)
Search and destroy
Search and destroy
Sold my soul to Heaven and to Hell
Sick as my secrets, but never gonna tell
I'm to blame, burden of my dreams
A curse of faith and a blessing I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe
Oh, I believe (a million little pieces)
I believe
Search and destroy
Search and destroy
(Woah oh oh woah)
Search and destroy
Search and destroy
Search and destroy
Let go, let go
Let me go, let me go
Let go, let go
Let me go
Search and destroy
A million little pieces
A million little pieces
A million little pieces
A million little pieces
(Search and destroy)
A million little pieces
A million little pieces
A million little pieces
Stolen from you
Woah oh oh woah
Woah oh oh woah
Woah oh oh woah
Woah oh oh woah
Search and destroy (Woah oh oh woah)
Search and destroy (Woah oh oh woah)
Search and destroy (Woah oh oh woah)
Search and destroy (Woah oh oh woah)
A million little pieces
A million little pieces to start<start>Si no te gustara tanto meterte en lÃ­os,
Si eligieras un camino asfaltado alguna vez,
ConservarÃ­as el sombrero norteÃ±o,
Y la chica triste que te hacia reÃ­r.
Aunque no la quisieras, ni ella a ti,
TenÃ­ais sed, siempre a la vez, en los mismos lugares, en los bares
ConservarÃ­as el bolsillo repleto,
Y la chica triste que te hacia reÃ­r.
Que no me lleven al hospital. No es que desconfÃ­e,
Es que no me fÃ­o de la medicina occidental.
Que no me lleven al hospital. Si ya me encuentro mejor!
Cuanto mÃ¡s viejo, decÃ­as, mucho mÃ¡s libre.
Menos plata que te arrebatan, y menos peso que cargar.
Ãltimamente, vas muy ligero,
Sin la chica triste que te hacÃ­a reÃ­r.
Siempre hay otro lugar en la frontera,
Siempre la esperanza queda, y quizÃ¡s pueda ser maÃ±ana,
Que el amanecer te traiga de vuelta
A la chica triste que te hacia reÃ­r.
Que no me lleven al hospital. No es que desconfÃ­e,
Es que no me fÃ­o de la medicina occidental.
Que no me lleven al hospital. Ya estoy mejor!
AsegÃºrate de que te dejen cerca de la parada,
La que estÃ© mÃ¡s cercana, y te aleje de la diana,
Y no te preocupes, por no despedirte de nadie<start>Your wine, it tastes so sweet
But it's no affaire d'amour
I can hear the ghosts of 14th St.
As they are running out the door
Can't you see you have no connections
It's plain to see you have no connections
You're oblivious to me
As you climb out of the top
Of some truck Limousine
Still filming your scene
You're talking way too loud
But there's nothing to exchange
You prefer to dine with your own crowd
Out there grazing on the range
Oh, can't you see you have no connections
It's plain to see you have no connections
No connections
It's plain to see you have no connections
You're oblivious to me
Now you're talking in the dark
Through my favorite scene
My favorite scene<start>slow down your mind
feel the unknown spaces with truth and lie
if you can find the time
time seems so slow
now we'r stuck here asking
where did it go
and what are we here for
CHORUS
there we were,
looking out some country window
and although we had our problems
we were fine
the sky was blue
and the night was all i wanted
let me be your commet i will fly
summer time so sweet
luxuries of chilhood were on our feet
and the sun sun sun
so baby run run run
baby run run run
baby run run run
place will be portraited<start>gabrielle don't need love any more
tries to hide herself behind her door
her hatred is sacred
gabrielle don't need love any...
she don't know
used to be alive inside her dreams
her life is so much harder than it seemed
she doesn't know what's said
from voices in her head
mother cries red tears for her
she don't know you no more
she don't even know herself
she don't know you no more
i didn't mean to push her
i did nothing to push her
isn't love and blood supposed to make her stay<start>Halt mich fester
Lass mich nie wieder los
Geh mit mir auf jeden Weg
Egal wohin - irgendwo

Nimm'mich mit bis zum bittren Ende

Halt mich fest so fest Du willst
Nimm'mich mit in die Ewigkeit

In Freiheit ist mein Herz unendlich schwer

Wenn ich Dich nur fühle
Wird mir unendlich heiß
Wenn ich Dich und Deinen Herzschlag spüre
Taut mein Herz aus eis
Folg mir in Gedanken
Bis es mich tief berührt
Begleite mich wenn ich traüme
Lass Dich von mir verführ'n
Nimm'mich mit in Deine Seele
Nimm'mich mit Gewalt
Nimm'mich mit bis ans Ende der Erde
Geb mich niemals frei
Denn in Freiheit ist mein Herz unendlich schwer
In Freiheit ist es unerträglich leer

Lass mich niemals mehr frei
In Freiheit ist mein Herz unendlich schwer
In Freiheit ist es unerträglich leer
Fang mich ein und fessel mich

Denn einsam - so einsam
Stirbt mein Herz
In Freiheit ist mein Herz unendlich schwer
In Freiheit ist es unerträglich leer

Oh-oh-oh-oh!<start>Shadow and jimmy were always yesterday's news
Jimmy's a bowler, shadow rents out his green bowling shoes
Late friday night when the bars are all shuttered and dark
He shadows back jimmy to the lot in the lost trailer park
For shadow and jimmy all the weekends end up the same
If it's saturday night, then it must be the hockey game
After cold beer and barbecued ribs the night is complete
With wrestling stories and elegant bones
That are tired of walking and on their way home
Chorus
And they talk about the women
And they look at the girls
They'll never know the ways of the world
They've got a mouthful of much obliged
And a handful of gimme
And the love for each other
Of shadow and jimmy
For shadow and jimmy now the story is told
There's nothing to hold on to and no one to hold
Men without women are like fish without
Water to swim in
With their eyes bugging out
They flop on the beach
And look up at the girls
Who are just out of reach
