 <start> She's so kissable huggable
Lovable unbelievable
She's a mouthful of anything and
Everything a man could want
She ain't typical she's
Unpredictable she's available
It's a miracle
How my heart stumbled into
Someone so kissable huggable
Lovable unbelievable
Up 'til now my life has been
So lonely and boring
I never thought I would find
Someone so
Elegant intelligent heaven sent
All my money spent
I put a big down payment on that
Itty bitty diamond ring
She's so beautiful
It's indisputable it's undeniable
She's gottohavable
She's music to my ears
Makes my heart sing so kissable
Huggable lovable unbelievable
There's so many things
I want to tell her
Like I love her
But every time I talk
I start to stutter <start> The money would be pretty good
If a quart of milk were still a dollar
Or even if a quart of milk were still a quart
And the hours well I don't mind
How they creep on by like an old love of mine
It's the years that simply disappear that are doing me in
Guess I married too young
Yeah nineteen was just too young
But sometimes you meet someone
And your guts just burn
It's not that I don't love him anymore
It's just that when I hear him
Coming through that front door
My heart doesn't race like it did once before
But I've got a horse out in the country
I get to see him every second Sunday
He comes when I call him
Yeah he knows his name
One day I'll saddle up
And the two of us will ride away
This weather I could almost stand
If the sun would shine a little brighter
Or even if the sun would shine at all
But lately it just seems to me
That this life has lost its mystery
And these cold fall mornings seem to bite
Just a little bit harder
And all my friends have settled down
Become their mothers and their fathers
Without a sound
Except for Cathy
She bought a oneway subway ticket
And left us all behind
But I've got a horse out in the country
I get to see him every second Sunday
He comes when I call him
Yeah he knows his name
One day I'll saddle up
And the two of us will ride away
This town wouldn't be so bad
If a girl could trust her instincts
Or even if a girl could trust a boy <start> WRITERS DON WILLIAMS CHARLES COCHRAN DAVID POMEROY
Which way is Santa Fe New Mexico
I've got some things to say she needs to know
Small brown adobe there where lives my heart
I just can't make it here with us apart
Which way is Santa Fe New Mexico
There was a dream I had I had to see
Salt of the ocean breeze calling to me
So much for me to do so much to be
Where is the dream I had what do I see
How can so much so right be wrong
Why should you have to leave
To know where you belong <start> I know that my surroundings aren't the very best
But my soul's on fire and won't let me rest
I'm doing things I really shouldn't do I guess I'm just pursuing happiness
I'm living much too fast a pace with two to care
I'm just looking for a dream that I can share
I'm sinking fast but no one hears my SOS I'm just pursuing happiness
Almost everyone I know has someone to worry
Someone to cheer them when they're low
So if I walk by you in too big a hurry it's because I got no place to go
Wherever people gather that's where I'll be found
In hope that someone's hand will reach and slow me down
Behind me I can feel that demon loneliness I'm just pursuing happiness

Almost everyone I know...
I'm just persuing happiness I'm just pursuing happiness <start> It was a teenage wedding and the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre did truly love the Mademoiselle
Now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell
C'est La Vie say the old folks it goes to show you never can tell
They furnished off an apartment with a two room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed with TV dinners and gingerale
When Pierre found work the little money comin' worked out well
C'est La Vie say the old folks it goes to show you never can tell
The had a HiFi phono and boy did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records all rock rhythm and jazz
When the sun went down the rapid tempo of the music fell
C'est La Vie say the old folks it goes to show you never can tell
They bought a soupedup jitney was a cherryred '
Drove it down to Orleans to celebrate their anniversary
It was there that Pierre was wedded to the lovely Mademoiselle
C'est La Vie say the old folks it goes to show you never can tell
C'est La Vie say the old folks it goes to show you never can tell
C'est La Vie say the old folks it goes to show you never can tell <start> Mama's standin' at the old screen door
With a dish rag in her hand
Cryin' like I never seen her cry before
Like she don't understand why
I'm leavin' a lonely town
I'm leavin' a lonely town
My old man he's workin' on his truck
Ain't never had much to say
Just shakes my hand and wishes me luck
And watches me walk away yeah
I'm leavin' a lonely town
I'm leavin' a lonely town
Drivin' one last time down Main Street
Past the cafe on the square
Go slow by the window cause I know she's
Waitin' tables in there but
I'm leavin' a lonely town
She knows I'm leavin' a lonely town
I'm leavin' a lonely town
Lord I'm leavin' a lonely town
Mama's standin' at the old screen door
Cryin' like I never seen her cry before
Lonely town lonely town
Lonely town <start> The devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind
Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal
When he came across this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said boy let me tell you what
I guess you didn't know it
But I'm a fiddle player too
And if you care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
Cause I think I'm better than you
The boy said my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
Cause I'm the best there's ever been
Johnny rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia and the devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul.
The devil opened up his case
And he said I'll start this show
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow
Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made a sic evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this
When the devil finished
Johnny said well you're pretty good old son
Just sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done
He played Fire on the Mountain
Run boys run
The devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in a bread pan picken' out dough
Granny does your dog bite
No child no
The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said Devil just come on back
If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a gun
I'm the best there's ever been
And he played Fire on the Mountain
Run boys run
The devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in a bread pan picken' out dough
Granny will your dog bite
No child no <start> 
Goldhearted Lady they don't understand you
They take you for granted
Think they understand you
You're not one to cry
But your heart has been broken
So one more love leaves a deeper scar open
You live alone in your world of colors
And every new cowboy won't be like the others
Goldhearted Lady halfhearted maybe
Goldhearted Lady they'll never
Understand why you needed their love
Goldhearted Lady the gypsyeyed wild one
The easy hairtrigger on everyman's gun
You're nobody's fool but then nobody wants you
You're every man's dream but still nobody loves you
They neglect you my friend
Like some freak at the fair
You're slow dyin' fire
Someone's unanswered prayer <start> Here the labor is so hard and the workers are tired
And our weary hearts are longing for a rest
And we find we're getting anxious to be in that happy land
Where we'll enjoy some peace and happiness
chorus
We may look into the skies and tears wil fill our eyes
For our weary hearts grow heavy with each day
First we cry oh Lord please comecome and take our children home
And then we look around us and we say
chorus
The family's scattered here and there but Lord we love them dear
And maybe we can help them find the way
Well if waiting is the cost well they might not be lost
Lord that's the reason why we say
Chorus
But wait a little longer please Jesus
There's still so many wanderin' out in sin
Just a little longer please Jesus
Just a few more days to get our loved ones in <start> If I had it my way
This would be the first time that you made love
I'd be the first man that your hands touched
But we'd both done our share of living
Takin' chances we were given
I've never been big on looking back
I don't care if I'm your first love
But I'd love to be your last
If I could do it over
I'd have waited for this moment
To give my heart to you unbroken
But if our mistakes brought us together
Doesn't really matter whether
We would say it's our centers in the past
I don't care if I'm your first love
I'd just love to be your last
All I know is what I see when I look at you
And all I see is what I'm feeling down inside
And all I'm feeling is this feeling
That I finally got it right
When I wake up tomorrow
I'm gonna throw my arms around you
Thank my lucky stars I found you
'Cause I know your heart had so much more
Than any man has touched before and
Nothing matters more to me than that
I don't care if I'm your first love
But I'd love to be your last <start> They're gonna make me a lifetime member
In the Forty First Street Lonely Heart's Club
Cause they know I'll always remember that I ain't got your love
I've got a presidential commendation from the Forty First Street Lonely Heart's Club
I'm the loneliest heart in the nation cause I ain't got your love
And I've got teardrops running off my face
And I've got mem'ries that I just can't erase
And I'll do my best to forget your love in the Forty First Street Lonely Heart's Club
 guitar 
Well I've come a long way since I started
In the Forty First Street Lonely Heart's Club
Cause I was voted Most Broken Hearted since I ain't got your love
My name's gonna go down in history in the Forty First Street Lonely Heart's Club
For outstanding achievement in misery cause I ain't got your love
And I've got teardrops...
Yes I'll do my best to forget your love in the Forty First Street Lonely Heart's Club <start> The sun isn't shining I see the clouds rolling in
It reminds me of the day and the words we said
The thunder and lightning is just about to begin
And I'm out here in the cold that's left over from the storm
Once again
'Cause every time it rains your memory comes pouring in
And every drop that falls it burns like alcohol flowing through my veins
Until the winds of change come and blow the clouds away
I'll still feel the shame and deal with the pain
Every time it rains
Maybe I'm foolish and Ill get through this I know
It just hurts inside that we couldn't weather our storm
The last time I saw you I knew the damage was done
'Cause we didn't make it we didn't get to see the lightning breaking
From the sun
'Cause every time it rains your memory comes pouring in
And every drop that falls it burns like alcohol flowing through my veins
Until the winds of change come and blow the clouds away
I'll still feel the shame and deal with the pain
Every time it rains
Until the winds of change come and blow the clouds away
I'll still feel the shame and deal with the pain
Every time it rains <start> There's a stack of daily papers on her doorstep
And the grass has grown up more than she'd allow
Yes it looks to me to be a little more than a vacation
Never knew that I'd miss her until now
From both ends the candle seemed to burn much brighter
I guess she saw the flame I tried so hard to die
Looks like I'm the one that got caught in the middle burnt my finger
I got there just in time to watch love die
Yes I got there just in time to watch love die mhm mhm
There's a change of address blank inside her mailbox
And the key she usually left for me is not here
Yes it's plain to see that she no longer needs an explanation
Guess I should have known I would not find her here
From both ends the candle seemed.
But I got there much too late to say goodbye <start> The sky is falling down around me
This kind of storm just might drown me
If I let it
It's hard to look on the bright side
When you've been blindsided by
Something you never saw coming
That worst thing you could imagine
I believe in God even when He's silent
I believe in the sun even when it isn't shining
I believe in good luck even when the dealer don't deal it
I believe in love I believe in love
Even when I can't feel it
Bad things happen to good people
Without any rhyme or reason it just happens
There's nothing fair about it
But what can I do about it
Tomorrow's another day
Good or bad either way
I believe in God even when He's silent
I believe in the sun even when it isn't shining
I believe in good luck even when the dealer don't deal it
I believe in love I believe in love
Even when I can't feel it <start> Walkin in Jerusalem

To ........Walking in Jerusalem.......... Just like John <start> Yesterday morning just before noon
I passed a girl wearing your old perfume
And I stopped and stared
I could almost see you standing there
Don't get me wrong I'm almost over you
But now and then I like to go walking through
Some of our old times
Even though I realize
I'll have another chance
I'll find another girl
I'll see another day
And I'll build another world
I'll start another life
Just like you told me to
And I'll find another love
But there will never be another you
Night after night I go back through the years
I sit on this porch as the sun disappears
Like we did back then
I remind myself once again
That I'll have another chance
I'll find another girl
I'll see another day
And I'll build another world
I'll start another life
Just like you told me to
I'll find another love
But there will never be another you
Well I guess I should thank you
For showing me how love should feel
I know what I'm gonna look for
'Cause I felt it when you held me
And I'll have another chance
I'll find another girl
I'll see another day
And I'll build another world
I'll start another life just
Like you told me to
I'll find another love
But there'll never be another you
Another you <start> Heart I'm ashamed of you lips I'm ashamed of you
You've betrayed me and you've made me love him and he's not free
Arms I'm ashamed of you aching the way you do
I'm ashamed of you but mostly I'm ashamed of me
Eyes you looked right past his wedding band
And all you saw were lips you long to kiss
Fool you tucked him into holding hands
And now you've let him tarry up like this
Heart I'm ashamed of you
Mind you let him drive me out of you
For you're made up to win his love somehow
Conscience ain't there something you can do
Cause if there is you'd better do it now
Heart I'm ashamed of you <start> The warm wind will not blow tonight
For the the fog enshrouds
The landing light
As she said she might have heard
A bell tolling
Though a gold ship
Sails her clouds and dreams
Through the crashing seas
She finds it seems
That the shore she's looking for
Is hardly showing
Oh what is this song she's singing
Oh could it be for someone
Bringing her her everything
Her paralytic agencies
Twist their tongues into philosophies
As petite Colombe asks only
What she's been stealing
The tapestries that drape her walls
And the heroes she has witnessed fall
While the hallway leaves them
All blank to the ceiling
Oh again this song she's singing
Oh could it be for someone
Bringing her her every dream
Beneath the deep and broken wall
The reflecting glass of time it falls
Through the crack she said
She heard the ocean calling
The foghorn cries profanity
At the master of insanity
As she watches ruins needing me and sobbing
Oh again this song she's singing
Oh could it be for someone
Bringing her her everything. <start> Buddy you might think
That I've lost my mind
But mister I'd pay twice
To do it one more time
It cost a thousand tears
And wore out my knees
But buddy that's okay
The heartaches are free
You probably thought I'd used
Up every brain I had
But mister won't you try
You'll swear that it ain't bad
It cost a thousand tears
And wear out your knees
But buddy that's okay
The heartaches are free
Hey man if she takes a notion
To sell you a hit of potion waste no time
And boss if you need a reason
To pay for all her teasin' well just take mine
It cost a thousand tears
And wear out your knees
But buddy that's okay
The heartaches are free oh no
Hey man if she takes a notion
To sell you a hit of potion waste no time
And boss if you need a reason
To pay for all her teasin' well just take mine
It cost a thousand tears
Wear out your knees
But buddy that's okay
The heartaches are free
Yeah I can guarantee
The heartaches are free <start> Folk always told me that my heart would grow
The older the man yeah the stronger the stone
Am I losing my mind
Am I growing backwards with time
Some say with age that a purpose comes clear
I see the opposite happening here
Are we losing the fight
Are we growing backwards with time
I was young and love was fun
Now it's so serious
Now all the fun has equal pain
There's something wrong with this
For all I know there's more I don't
Oh the little I have learned
For every year of knowledge gained
Is a negative year I've earned
Folk always told me that my heart would grow
The older the man yeah the stronger the stone
Am I losing my mind <start> I was dancing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced him to my loved one and while they were dancing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Only God knows how much I have lost
Yes I lost my little darling the night they were playing the beautiful Tennessee Waltz
I was dancing with my darling... <start> She knows who I am she knows what I do I'm a high rolling dreamer that never comes through but she won't criticize and she does'nt complaign she hides all the hurt and she lives with the pain
But I know I'm losing her one heartache at a time I see it in her eyes each time I cross another line she'll say that she forgives she'll say that we'll be fine but she's falling out of love one heartache at a time
All she wants is someone with his feet on the ground but all she's got is a jerk that keeps letting her down she knows I can't change so she does'nt get mad and when she thinks I'm not looking she looks so sad
And I know I'm losing her one heartache at a time I see it in her eyes each time I cross another line she'll say that she forgives she'll say that we'll be fine but she's falling out of love one heartache at a time
Brige Every single tear I made her cry brings her one step closer to good bye she'll say that she forgives she'll say that we'll be fine but she's falling out of love one heartache at a time she's falling out of love one heartache at a time <start> I take the tiger by the tail take the bull by the horns
Look the bear right square in the eye
But when it comes to a girl like you I'll get kinda shy
I'm just as strong as the knock just as smart as the fox
Not a mill that I haven't been through
But when you're standin' close to me I don't know what to do
It's kinda silly I must admit to let you scare me right out of my wits
But when your eyes look into mine well all I can see it's a danger sign
I take the tiger by the tail take the bull by the horns
Look the bear right square in the eye
And one of these days just wait and see a wild cat I will be
I'll pick up and carry you off and take you home with me
I shake a rattle on sneak eat a crocodile cake
Lock an elephant's trunk up tight
But when it's time to hold your hand I'm a sorry sight
It's kinda silly I must admit <start> I'm throwing rice at the girl that I love
After she just said I do
I'm throwing rice with a smile on my lips
But my heart is breaking in two
She was my gal and he was my pal
But she loved him better somehow
I stepped aside after I kissed the bride
And I'm throwing rice at her now
I'm throwing rice at the girl that I love
After she just said I do
I'm throwing rice with a smile on my lips
But my heart is breaking in two
She was my gal and he was my pal
But she loved him better somehow
I stepped aside after I kissed the bride
And I'm throwing rice at her now <start> BABY'S BACK AGAIN

Oh Yeah Boy I Like Em Really Hot Like That <start> Momma loved us every one
Every daughter every son
She gave herself so happily
That's just the way she was you see
From dawn to dark she'd find a chore
And work it 'til it was no more
And every day until she died
In the evening momma cried
Momma cried
There was mourning in the evening
And momma cried
'Cause her little girl was gone
Her little girl was snatched away
She was there and then just gone one day
And momma blamed herself I'd say
But all of us had debts to pay
Momma cried
There was mourning in the evening
And momma cried
'Cause her little girl was gone
I did my best to cheer her pride
That day that something broke inside
I swore I'd find her and I tried
In the evening momma cried
Momma cried
There was mourning in the evening
And momma cried
'Cause her little girl was gone
Momma cried
There was mourning in the evening
And momma cried
'Cause her little girl was gone <start> When I was just a lad of ten my father said to me
Come here and take a lesson from the lovely lemon tree
Don't put your fate in love my boy my father said to me
I fear you'll find that love is like the lovely lemon tree
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower's sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower's sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
One day beneath the lemon tree my love and I did lie
A girl so sweet that when she smiles the star grows in the sky
We passed that summer lost in love beneath the lemon tree
The music of her laughter hit my father's words for me
Lemon tree very pretty
Lemon tree very pretty <start> i like you better

my light punked out on me

i like you better

i like you better <start> The bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
The cabarets and honky tonks their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights
 in a glass of cherry wine
 for empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights
The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
Did the God who put those stars above make those city lights
Did he make a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right
Are we just supposed to run and hide behind those city lights
 in a different atmosphere
 but a masquarade for tears
They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
And I just can't say I love you to a street of city lights <start> I'd like to settle down but they won't let me a fugitive must be a rolling stone
Down every road there's always one more city I'm on the run the highway is my home
I raised a lot of cane back in my younger days
While mama used to pray my crops would fail
Now I'm a hunted fugitive with just two ways outrun the law or spend my life in jail
I'd like to settle down...
 guitar 
I'm lonely but I can't afford the luxury of having one I love to come along
She'd only slow me down and they'd catch up with me
For he who travels fastest goes alone
I'd like to settle down...
I'm on the run the highway is my home <start> Silver wings
Shine in the sunlight.
Roaring engines
Heading somewhere in flight.
They're taking you away.
Leavin' me lonely.
Silver wings
Slowly fadin' outta sight.
Don't leave me I cry.
Don't take that airplane ride.
But you locked me out of your mind.
Left me standin' here behind.
Silver wings
Shine in the sunlight.
Roaring engines
Heading somewhere in flight.
They're taking you away.
Leavin' me lonely.
Silver wings
Slowly fadin' outta sight.

Shine in the sunlight.
Roaring engines
Heading somewhere in flight.
They're taking you away.
Leavin' me lonely.
Silver wings
Slowly fadin' outta sight.
Silver wings
Slowly fadin' out of sight.
Slowly fadin' out of sight.
Slowly fadin' out of sight. <start> Oh you said that you loved me that your heart would be true
But now you've gone and left me I'm so blue
I believed in you darling that your heart would be true
But now you've gone and left me I'm so blue
Our vows have been broken you have proven untrue
Another has my sweetheart and the love that I once knew
I believed in you darling that your heart would be true
But now you've gone and left me I'm so blue
Oh the nights are so lonely dreams of you haunt me so
What's happened little darling I don't know
I believed in you darling that your heart would be true
But now you've gone and left me I'm so blue <start> Long ago with a younger partner
Always in love but a love for sure
Their hearts were lost out in the shuffle
Of a hook  wing on a sawdust floor
Now they hold their own out on the liners
They're always prime for something slow
And you won't find them changin' partners
Love will keep in step keepin' up with a country set
It's our kind of love I'll bet they're together everywhere they go
Now they're on in years they don't need a reason
All the lights are on for the same old thing
When they call Let's dance their song will still be playin'
Till the end of time their love'll be in full swing
And they hold their own out on the liners
They're always prime for something slow
And you won't find them changin' partners
Love will keep in step keepin' up with a country set
It's our kind of love I'll bet they're together everywhere they go <start> They say I sing my songs with lots of blue eyed soul
What they mean is Lord I sing it sad
But feeling like I feel I can't sing no other way
She left me Lord and oh I hurt so bad
And lonesome is the mother of soul
And lonesome gave birth to my blues
I'm the orphan child of emptiness
The son of heartache untold
And lonesome is the mother of soul
I thought that hurts like this were saved for those who are dying
Lord I must be dying and not know
The soulful sound you hear from me is only my heart crying
I'm lonesome and I miss my baby so
And lonesome is the mother of soul
And lonesome gave birth to my blues
I'm the orphan child of emptiness
The son of heartache untold
And lonesome is the mother of soul <start> You may live alone and close your eyes some folks do
You may dream a dream that's twice your size all night through
When the morning comes who's to tell your dreams to only you
Only love love only only love will do
Only love love only only love comes true
Nothing else you see there's nothing else only love only love
I have known a love within my heart one for you
When this love began right from the start I never knew
If love should come your way you'd ever say I love you I love you
Only love love only only love will do
Only love love only only love comes true
Nothing else you see there's nothing else only love only love <start> Gonna lay my burden down
Lay my body in the ground
Cold clay against my skin
But I don't care at all
Can't seem to find my piece of mind
So with the earth I'll lay entwined
Six feet underground
My feet are warm and dry
When I get to the other side
I'll put your picture way up high
But I'm not coming back to you
It's just too far
If I was cast off on the sea
Would you come and look for me
Or would you just let me sink
Beneath the waves so blue
What if I had learned to fly
Fly all night till day drew nigh
Touch down upon a branch and
Scan the crowd for you
When I touch my feet on the land
I'll kiss your lips and take you in
But you know I'm not here to stay
It's just too far
Darling can't you hear me cry
My bones are broke
My tongue is tied
The moon is swaying back and forth
Against the navy sky
Is all I can see
My body is trembling on my knees
Just have a little mercy on me
Run away and hide
When I sleep the angels sing
But I cannot hear a thing
Eyes close
Dreaming of the better days gone by
When I wake the trumpets play
And I'm standing at the gates
Fall down and joy
I know my race has just been won
When I was young my momma would say
Well life is hard but that's O.K.
If you can make it through the day
It's not that far
No it's not that far <start> Our Darlin' wandered far away while she was out at play
Lost in the woods she couldn't hear a sound
She was our darlin' girl the sweetest thing in all the world
We searched for her but she couldn't be found
I heard the screams of our little girl far away
Hurry daddy there's an awful dreadful snake
I ran as fast as I could through the dark and dreary wood
But I reached our darlin' girl too late
Oh I began to sigh I knew that soon she'd have to die
For the snake was warnin' me close by
I held her close to my face she said Daddy kill that snake
It's gettin' dark tell Mommy goodbye
To all parents I must say don't let your children stray away
They need your love to guide them along
Oh God I pray we'll see out darlin' some day
It seems I still can hear her voice around our home <start> 
Nothing new nothing different nothing better nothing more
Nothing else to give you I didn't give before
I gave my love completely my heart was always yours
It wouldn't do I still lost you
You want to give it one chance Don't know why we should
We'd never get that far again or make the love that good
We had our chance we blew it And I'll never understand
Careless fools I still lost you
You want to fan the flames of love stir up passion's fire
Conjure up familiar lusts stir up past desires
What we had then we don't have now And I would just compare
I refuse I still lost you
Too late for starting over it hardly ever works
Too many missing pieces too much water too much hurt
I already lost you once and that makes matters worse
What's the use I still lost you
Oh you want to fan the flames of love stir up passion's fire
Conjure up familiar lusts stir up past desires
What we had then we don't have now And I would just compare
I refuse I still lost you
Oh what's the use I still lost you
I lost you <start> When we first started on our way through love
We thought we were two of a kind
We thought forever was just you and me
And always a matter of time
Time has a way of changin' it's mind
We're givin' on each others heart
Our love grew till it ran out of room
Now it looks like we're growing apart
We had a mountain of our very own
That turned out we just couldn't climb
We've just been waiting for something to give
And we've been standing in line
Time has a way of changin' it's mind
We're givin' on each others heart
Our love grew till it ran out of room
Now it looks like we're growing apart <start> 
Stay out of my bedroom
Don't be messin' up my pillows and sheets
With your powder and perfume
If you don't have some understanding of me
Don't be kncokin' on my door
I don't want you to play in my fantasies
Stay out of my bedroom
Baby if you can't take the heat
If you want it come and get it baby
Satisfaction guaranteed
I'm a pleaser free and eager
I ain't never had as much fun as I need
Easy lovin' that's down my alley
I may be easy but at least I'm cheap
Stay out of my bedroom baby
Baby if you can't take the heat
Stay out of
Stay out of
You're dealin' with some hot stuff
Baby can you deal with the heat
We might burn on forever we might burn on tonight
Where there's smoke there is fire from the flames that I ignite
The heat is intense when the fire's blazin' high
Slavin' over all those red hot lovers at night
If you come to my bedroom the heart of the heat
I will pleasure your body in sheer ecstasy
I will touch you in places no one else ever reached
Till you won't remember anybody else but me
If you want it come and get it
If it burns you don't come cryin' to me
Don't come knockin' on my door
Baby if you can't take the heat
Don't be peepin' through my window
If you don't appreciate what you see
Stay out of my bedroom baby
Baby if you can't take the heat
Stay out of stay out of
You're dealin' with some hot stuff
Baby can you deal with the heat
Stay out of my bedroom...
If you can't take it stay out of my bedroom <start> No home no home said a little girl
At the door of a rich man's home
She trembling stood on the marble steps
And leaned on the polished wall
Her clothes were thin and her feet were bare
And the snowflakes covered her head
Let me come in she feebly said
Please give me a little bread
As the little girl still trembling stood
Before that rich man's door
With a frowning face he scornfully said
No room no bread for the poor
Then the rich man went to his table so fine
Where he and his family were fed
And the orphan stood in the snow so deep
As she cried for a piece of bread
The rich man slept on his velvet couch
And he dreamed of his silver and gold
While the orphan lay in a bed of snow
And murmured so cold so cold
The hours rolled on through the midnight storm
Rolled on like a funeral bell
The sleet came down in a blinding sheet
And the drifting snow still fell
When morning came the little girl
Still lay at the rich man's door
But her soul had fled away to its home
Where there's room and there's bread for the poor <start> Pride sad splendid liar
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled
I've cast it to the winds
Broken beaten sick at heart
My confession begins.
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way
I surrender dear.
I may seem proud I may act gay
It's just a pose I'm not that way
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender dear.
Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game
Lending a spice to the wooing
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call
To you my love my life my all
I surrender dear.
We've played the game of stay away

To you my love my life my all <start> Waiting for the train to come
I keep a'waiting for the train to come
Dreamin' of the river and the rising sun
I keep thinkin' 'bout the world to come
My life packed up in a suitcase
Old man staring from a doorway
My hope tarries in the distance
Love comes on the wheels of my deliverance
Ohohooohoh where is the river unbroken
Ohohooohoh when will the whistle blow
Waitin' for the train to come
I keep waitin' for the train to come
Keepin' my appointment with the one who lives
In the heart of everything that is
All night sleepin' in a station
My God it's hard not to be impatient
I watch through the windows of forgiveness
I cry but my word's my only witness
Ohohooohoh where is the river unbroken
Ohohooohoh when will the whistle blow
Ohohooohoh where is the river unbroken
Ohohooohoh when will the whistle blow
Sometimes I feel I can't go on I can't go on
I get so tired all passion's gone
My heart my head my arms my legs I get so tired
Without the strength to crawl away
Then something breaks inside my soul My strength is gone
That spirit's finally taking hold
My ears can hear my eyes can see
Those clouds of joy still cover me cover me cover me
Ohohooohoh where is the river unbroken
Ohohooohoh when will the whistle blow
Ohohooohoh where is the river unbroken
Ohohooohoh when will the whistle blow
Ohohooohoh where is where is the river unbroken
Ohohooohoh when will the whistle blow
Fade
Waiting for the train to come

Bears to the left bears to the right
We didn't have no place to go.
They had us backed up clean to the shore
And them cabover Petes don't float.
I says Pig Pen I got me a good idea.
Them Friends a' Jesus gonna save us
So praise the Lord and Mister Ford
And follow that micrabus tenfour.
Now imagine a bunch of rowdy pirates  the buccaneer type not software  chanting the Chorus.
Chorus
Yo ho ho and a thousand trucks
Gonna take a bath with a Rubber Duck
Yo ho ho and a lots a' luck
'Round the world with the Rubber Ducky
Yeah we drove on the water like diesel whales
Sank about a hunnertandten of 'em
I says Pig Pen they just didn't have no faith
They definitely gone tenseven.
By the time we got into that Piccadilly Town
'Bout half of 'em was lost at sea

Spoken in a sorta British accent
I say Fabersham. Looks likes the Americans have got themselves another bloody Convoy.
Chorus
Yo ho ho and a thousand trucks
Gonna take a bath with a Rubber Duck
Yo ho ho and a lots a' luck
'Round the world with the Rubber Ducky
Spoken in the same sorta British accent
Good heavens Look at them all Half of them are sinking in the Thames Hello Some of our truck chaps are assisting them. Good show actually. Oh well tenfour and all that rubbish.
Well we crossed that Channel like snakes on glass
And stormed the beach about dawn
I says Grab your shifters and punch 
We all goin' truckin' on the Autobahn.
Now Pig Pen this here's the ultimate slab
'Cause there goes a Mercedes truck.
He says Break onethree for the Strudel Machine
Ya just blew the doors off'n the Duck. How 'bout it
Spoken in a sorta German accent. A really bad German accent.
Oh zehnvier Rubber Duck. Ve are receiving you valltovall but the schpeed limit on za Autobahn is triplenickels. You travel too schlow Rubber Duck. We gonna see you around. We gone. Wiedersehen.
If you know the song then you can skip this note. If you don't then a bit of explanation is necessary. During the next verse the chorus  is heard in the background. What they're singing is what's printed in the tiny little letters. No I am not making this up. That's what they're singing.
Well we stopped for a coffee in West Berlin
Dumb dumb dumb. This is
The British had hundredmile tea
dumb dumb dumb dumb.
I says Pig Pen from here on it's walltowall bears.
Dumb dumb dumb dumb
Says Bash the Wall we gonna see.
Dumb dumb dumb dumb.
Well them big red bears must'a been in the bush
Dumb dumb dumb. This is
'Cause we didn't see a one all day
Dumb dumb dumb dumb
So we raked up the leaves and we shook out the tree
Dumb dumb dumb. This is
'Til they finally had something to say
Dumb dumb dumb.
You got it..
Spoken in a bad Russian accent. A really bad... you know the rest.
Comrade Duck you have been given until daybreak in Murmansk to get your cottonpickin' trucks out of the U. S. S. of R. You will copy
That 'dumb' chorus continues.
Well we shot them rigs through saltmine city
Dumb dumb
With a hammer and a sickle on down
Dumb dumb
Then we hit the fan through the Sea of Japan
Dumb dumb
Tooled into Transistor Town
Dumb dumb
I says Pig Pen this here must be the place
Dumb dumb
'Cause everybody's eatin' with sticks.
Dumb dumb
He says TenFour this here is CB land
Dumb dumb
'Cause my channel knob just went crick.
Dumb dumb
Spoken in a really bad Japanese 
Ah so Lubba Duck. You have a nice day today betta day tomollow. We catch you on fripfrop. This one Kamikaze Ozzie we gone. Sayonara.
Chorus
Yo ho ho and a thousand trucks
Gonna take a bath with a Lubba Duck

This here's the Rubber Duck tenten and doin' it to it like Pruitt used'ta do it to it. We gone. 'Bye'bye. <start> I'm just the same fool
The old fool
The one fool
That you won't fool no more
'Least not the way that you fooled
The last fool you fooled before
So let the next fool
The new fool
Be a fool
That you will fool for sure
Just know that this fool
won't be fooled
Like all those other fools no more
Go find some real fool
No near fool
The kind of fool
That knows what fools are for
That'll give your foolin' heart
Those foolish thrills
It won't stand a chance to ignore
They'll be a fine fool
A flat blind fool
A sort of fool
With not a clue about what's in store
Doing every foolfilled thing
you need him to
For however long it is
that fools endure
You might be finding
A little lately
That I've been a greatly
Changing man
You don't seem worried
So I'm encouraged
This won't discourage
All your other plans
I'm just the same fool
The old fool
The one fool
That you won't fool no more
'Least not the way that you fooled
The last fool you fooled before
No not the way that you fooled
All those other fools no more <start> Hurt is no stranger to me
And oh how well I know misery
You've always hurt me
But I always forgive
And I'll hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live
Oh it's my fault for loving you so deeply
I'd give you my love completely
I'd give you love but hurt is all you give
And I hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live
For as long as I love you there'll be pain
Though tears come and go
My love remains the same
I'll always forgive you
You know that I will
And I hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live
Yes I've hurt for as long as I loved you
And I'll love you for as long as I live <start> Joey lived a mile out a Southern Cross
Working on trucks for the local pit boss
Friday nights when he'd come to town
They'd all line up to see him lay some
Rubber down
Joey had a ute built in '
With a  Chevy and  on the floor
Chrome wire wheels and customized back
He could run the main street  mile in under  flat
Cause he's the king of the road out here
He's won four big Ford's and an old John Deer
He won the summer nationals twice
He's the king of the road out here on Friday nights
Was a summer's night and I remember it well
A city boy thought he had a story to tell
He had a turbo charged flash in the pan
He walked up to Joey and said hey
I hear you're the man
The whole town was there it was quite a scene
It was the biggest race there ever had been
That little car looked pretty in red
Now Joey's gran is driving it instead
You might have Brocky in the city spotlight
But you ain't ever seen Joey on a Friday night
Folks come a running from miles around
Just to see our Joey laying rubber down <start> Two men sittin' in straight back chairs
Feet propped up on the railin'
Sittin' in front of the country store
Discussin' how the crops were failin'
About that time a car drove by
With an Ace Insurance bumper sticker
Well that must be the man been courtin' Abell
He's somethin' of a city slicker

Do you reckon he's goin' up to see Abell
You know her daddy went to Maben this day
And her mommas been in Arkansas with her ailin' pa
Ain't nobody home that way

Now I don't mean nothing by what I say
But if you won't say it I can
She ain't got no bid'ness alone
With that Ace Insurance man

People ought to keep an eye on they're kids
You remember 'bout Abby Mcguinness
Why'it lik'ta kill'ed her ma when she found out about it
Course I know it ain't none of my bid'ness
But uh well if it was me if it was me
It might be too late and it would be a pity
Better call up the sheriff in Calhoun city
And have the preacher organize a 'vestigating committee
To see what's going on

Tearing down the road in a pickup truck
With Bentley out taking the lead
Followed by a tractor and a half lame mule
Dust flyin' as they picked up speed
Faces beaming goodness and their jaw's set hard
Good people just doin' what's right
And off in the distance was Abell's house
And there wasn't a soul in sight
Aw I could'a told you

Now the gravel was flying as he turned the bend
And screeched to a grinding halt
They went through the fence into the flower bed
And hit pa's firstprize hog in the head
And left half a dozen mama's chickens for dead
But it wasn't nobody's fault
Oh look at Harvey's prize hog
And all of them darlin' old grown bad trusty chickens

I wonder if they're covered
Committee bounded on the front porch
To meet the enemy face to face
But Abell yelled at 'em through the screen door
y'all messed up my daddy's place
But in her hand she waved a policy
Sayin' with a Mona Lisa grin
Well y'all timed that one just about right
'Cause Ace done struck again <start> Woke up this morning and I could not keep from crying
Woke up this morning and I could not keep from crying
My good gal left me with a troubling mind
Oh just look where that evening sun has gone
Oh just look where that evening sun has gone
Gone down behind the mountain and it won't be back till morn
Oh hand me that long distance phone
Oh hand me that long distance phone
Gonna talk to my honey all night long
Oh take me back and try me one more time
Oh take me back and try me one more time
And if I don't do then send me down the line <start> Let me whisper darling one more time let the soft curves of your body cling to mine
Let me feel you through and through I can't get enough of you
Let me whisper darling oner more time
Everytime I hold you it gets harder to let you go and get you off my mind
Stay with me and let me take you farther and higher than you've ever dared to climb
And I know you've got somebody else and I know you've got to go but before you do
Let me whisper darling...
The night's almost over but I'm not ready to let you go
Please let me whisper darling one more time <start> In God I trust to always give me faith in God I trust to drive away my hate
To fill my heart with his forgiven love yes I believe in him In God I trust
In God I trust to make me understand in God I trust to always hold my hand
To lead me on and take me when he must yes I believe in him In God I trust
That he'll be there when darkness falls over me
To give me light and guide me through life's raging sea
And when this world becomes a worthless dust I'll be with him above in God I trust
I'll be with him above in God I trust <start> Things like other people have not just dreams that's all gone bad
She's had all the dreamin' she could stand
Chased our dreams endlessly through it all she stood by me
More than that Lord she was such a friend
Dreamin's all I had to give she needed more to live
She's had all the dreamin' she could stand
She's had all the dreamin' she could stand
She want something real she can hold in her hand
Things like other people have 
She's had all the dreamin' she could stand

I'm so much cooler online
I'm so much cooler online

Oh yeah <start> 
He wanted more from like
Than four kids and a wife
And a job in the dark Kentucky mines
A twentyacre farm
With a shacky house and barn
That's all he had
And all he left behind
At gambling he was lucky
So he left Kentucky
Left behind his woman and his kids
Into the gay casino
In Nevada's town of Reno
Kentucky gambler planned to get rich quick
Kentucky gambler who's gonna love your woman in Kentucky
Who's gonna be the one to give her what she needs
Kentucky gambler who's gonna raise your children in Kentucky
Who's gonna keep them fed and keep shoes on their feet
At the gamblers' paradise
Lady luck was on his side
Kentucky gambler played his cards just right
He won at everything he played
Kentucky gambler had it made
And he should have quit and gone on home that night
But when you love the greenback dollar
Sorrow's always bound to follow
Reno dreams fade into neon amber
And lady luck she'll leave you on
She'll saty awhile and then she's gone
You'd better go on home Kentucky gambler
But a gambler never seems to stop
Til he loses all he's got
And so Kentucky gambler he played on
He played til he lost all he won
He was right back where he started from
Then he started wanting to go home
Kentucky gambler there ain't nobody waiting in Kentucky
When you walked out somebody else walked in
Kentucky gambler looks like you ain't really very lucky
Seems to me a gambler looses much more than he wins
So you think about it
Kentucky gambler <start> Today the sun came up in the West
And it went down in the East
If I laid awake a thousand nights
I tried to rest at least
I watch you come and go sometimes
I watch the floor for moves
The shapes in this room move so still
Just shadows of your shoes
I ain't found nobody yet
You know that did just fine
I ain't found nobody yet
They say that these things take time
I build the statues up like walls
I'm building a fortress from nothing at all
And trying to wish it away
I watch you come and go sometimes
My watch clocks the moves
I can no longer keep hearing the lies
That we can not bear to lose
I'm watching the days
All fall away like leaves
On November trees
I clearly can't see
What's in front of me
But I can't leave
I get up before the sun rises
And try not to notice the day
I wonder if I could hear what you hide
Would it be the same Would I hear you say
That you ain't found nobody yet <start> Fourth of July the rain was pourin' down on ' town that evenin'
'Bout the time the fireworks hit the sky
And you said Happy Independence day oh and by the way I'm leavin'
I didn't know you could be so cut and dry
So sad goodbye

No rhyme no reason why it's just
Good love gone bad

I lost the best that I ever had
I gotta pick up pieces of my shattered dreams
While the world spins right out from under my feet
So sad good love gone bad
The ways of love are tough and steep
Keeps teachin' me the hard way
Guess what I think this time I finally learned
So if you find yourself at home alone don't you dial my number
'Cause I won't be here where we're concerned oh yeah
So sad goodbye

No rhyme no reason why it's just
Good love gone bad

You lost the best that you ever had
You gotta pick up pieces of your shattered dreams
While the world spins right out from under your feet
So sad good love gone bad
It's all so sad
But when it's right it's right

When it's wrong it's gone

Time to say so long
So sad good love gone bad
So sad good love gone bad
Yeah best you ever had
Hey <start> Off he goes down the road
Who knows how many he's been down before
With all the years he's come to know
Does he wonder if he's gonna see one more
Hanging on to yesterdays
Till too many tomorrows are today
With all the turns the road will bring
Well a young man's gotta wait and see
And will I ever be the old man
Whose words young ones ponder on
Will I ever take a lady's hand
And will I ever be the old man
Who finally is too far gone
Will there come a day when I can't stand
Am I gonna live that long
Reaching out for days to come
Where an old man walks a young man runs
The road I know is bound to end
Still I can't help wondering where and when
And will I ever be the old man
Whose words young ones ponder on
Will I ever take a lady's hand
And will I ever be the old man
Who finally is too far gone
Will there come a day when I can't stand
Tell me am I gonna live that long <start> If I claim to have the answers
Would I be taken chances lovin you
And if I thought the time was right
I shouldn't stay with you tonight who would lose
You got me dancin down these muddy roads
Soft sand between my toes feelin fine
Sunlight dancin on my back
Shirt in hand singin out in crazy rhymes
If I could see around the bend
Would it change the time I spent lovin you
If I could pick the perfect rose from all the pretty blooms
That grow how could I chose
You got me dancin down these muddy roads
Soft sand between my toes feelin fine
Sunlight dancin on my back
Shirt in hand singin out in crazy rhymes
If I could count the days to come
Mark them off one by one spent with you
I'd be rich but never poor
I'd find myself with many more than I could use
You got me dancin down these muddy roads
Soft sand between my toes feeling fine
Sunlight dancin on my back
Shirt in hand singin out in crazy rhymes <start> You wanna rock with the cops on the front line
You wanna kick it with the people in the back
You strike a match and you throw back a cocktail
There's got to be a better way
CHORUS
Cus it is hard to stay
It is hard to wait
To outlove to outsuffer them

I wanna dream up a world I wanna live in
I wanna spray it on a building downtown
I wanna protest for
Cus there's got to be a better way
CHORUS
I don't wanna wait
No drugs nor sleep
I wanna hold your hand really
God bless these bombs
Baptize this rope
Lie with us in the bed we've made
CHORUS <start> I'm a man of my word I mean what I say
My pledge is my bond that's just my way
When you've made a promise to someone who's gone
Well that's when forever seems a little too long
I'm a man of my word and I made you a vow
I swore that I'd loved you
And I can't change that now
They tell me I'm free to find someone new
I just don't have the heart
Cause I gave mine to you
I said my love would last for all time
And no one would take your place
Well if that promise was the last sound you heard
Well you know I kept it I'm a man of my word
I'm a man of my word and it's cost me so dear
Cause those words are a prison without you here
And I'll go to my grave with this torch held high
But just once I wish I had told you a lie
I said my love would last
Yes I'll always love you I'm a man of my word <start> This time
Is the last time
That I'll ever call her name
This time
Is the last time
That I'll ever play her game
And this time
Is the last time
That I'll endure this pain
'Cause this time
Is the last time
She'll ever hurt me again
I tell myself each morning
That we're through
But every night I see
That it's not true
I run out
And track her down
Just so I can hang around
And cry
This time
Is the last time
That I'll ever call her name
This time
Is the last time
That I'll ever play her game
And this time
Is the last time
That I'll endure this pain
'Cause this time
Is the last time
She'll ever hurt me again
Come on heart let's make believe we're fine
We'll both agree the pain's just in our mind
I'll close my eyes and try not to hear
The things I'll say when she appears
To haunt me <start> Whenever forever comes when darkness shall hide the sun
I'll still be shining with love for you
When glory bells chime my love will ring true
Heaven and earth shall pass away but my love will be yours always
Whenever forever comes when all things are said and done
I'll still be feeling the same way I do
I'll be there for you and still wanting you
God gave you to me and me to you
And you will still be the one whenever forever comes
We'll float on a cloud through eternity
You'll gather the stars you'll give them to me
I'll give you the moon and we'll replace the sun
Whenever forever comes whenever forever comes
What would I have ever done had I not had you to love
You've given me more than I ever dreamed
Loving you more every day so it seems
Greater than all other loves I have seen
Its essence will linger on whenever forever comes <start> There's a yellow rose in Texas that I'm gonna see
Nobody else could miss her not half as much as me
She cried so when I left her it'd like to broke my heart
And if I'd ever find her we never more will part
She's the sweetest little rosebud that Texas ever knew
Her eyes are bright as diamonds they sparkle like the dew
You may talk about Clementine and sing of Rosalee
But the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl for me
Where the Rio Grande is flowing and the skies are bright
She walks along the river in the quiet summer night
I know that she remembers when we parted long ago
I promised that I'll return and not to leave her so
She's the sweetest little rosebud
Now I'm going back to find her for my heart is full of vow
We'll do the things together we did so long ago
We'll play the banjo gaily she'll love me like before
And the yellow rose of Texas shall be mine for ever more
She's the sweetest little rosebud <start> I come to the garden alone while the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear the son of God discloses
And he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there none other has ever known
He speaks and the sound of his voice is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that he gave to me within my heart is ringing
And he walks with me
And the joy we share as we tarry there none other has ever known <start> Familiar this sounds so familiar
You tell me I'm a drama queen
You act like you don't care
You look right past me like I was a ghost
Someone you don't even know
I don't know why I still love you
When all you do is make me
Cry cry cry baby
I don't know why I think you're gonna save me
You just stand and watch my tears hit the floor
Like it doesn't even matter anymore
I don't really wanna leave tonight
But I don't wanna be your crybaby
Lonely I can take being lonely
I've kinda gotten used to it
You treat me like you don't know me
Well maybe you never did
They say there's nothin to it
Cry cry cry baby
I don't know why I think you're gonna save me
You just stand and watch my tears hit the floor
Like it doesn't even matter anymore
I don't really wanna leave tonight
But I don't wanna be your crybaby
Someones gotta do it
So I'm telling you goodbye
And all I wanna do is
Cry cry cry baby
I don't know why I think you're gonna save me
You just stand and watch my tears hit the floor
Like it doesn't even matter anymore
I don't really wanna leave tonight
But I don't wanna be your crybaby
I don't really wanna leave tonight
And it rips me apart inside
But I'm not gonna be your crybaby
No I'm not gonna be your cry crybaby
You just stand and watch my tears hit the floor
Like it doesn't even matter anymore
I don't really wanna leave tonight
But I don't wanna be your crybaby <start> Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ringtingtingling too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling yoohoo
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggling close together
Like two birds of a feather should be
Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
There's a birthday party
At the house of farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending
To the perfect day
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing
Without a single stop
At the fireplace where
We'll watch the chestnuts pop
There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee
And the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print
By Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our lives <start> I'll remember always no I won't forget you
I'll remember always each adventure that we dared
I'll remember always all the happiness we ever shared
Then there were the other times of the sorrow we went through
But I'll remember always no I won't forget you
All the empty dreams that we once knew soon were more than filled
Lady Luck she truly smiled and put us in her will
And even now that you've gone I'll have mem'ries still unused
And I'll remember always there'll never be another you
 steel 
I'll remember always all the hardships we ever new
I'll remember always all the dreams we watched come true
Disappointment could come by and we'd cry when feeling blue
But I'll remember always no I won't forget you
All the empty dreams...
I'll remember always no I won't forget you <start> I wish I was a millionaire
I'd play rock music and grow long hair
I tell you boys I'd buy a new Rolls Royce.
Pretty women'd come to me I'd give 'em all the third degree
I'd give 'em Satin Sheets to keep 'em off the streets.
Hallelujah
Let me sook it to ya
Praise the Lord and pass the tambourine
Great Jehova
You'll come over
As soon as you see me boogiewoogie
Cross the silver screen.
I can hang 'em high or hang 'em low
I'd put 'em in the ceilings wherever I'd go
And swing all night from the rafter lights.
Hallelujah
Let me sook it to ya
I wish you was a millionaire
Hallelujah
Let me sook it to ya <start> I don't want you mean mama
There ain't no use you hangin' 'round
For I found me another baby
And now I am Chicago bound
You've been fooling me baby
You've been telling me your lies
When I thought you were an angel
Just sent down from the skies
Don't sing those parting blues to me sweet babe
When I'll leave I'll leave you sad
Now your daddy's goin' to leave you
'Cause you treated me so bad
You've been fooling me baby
You've been telling me your lies
When I thought you were an angel
Just sent down from the skies
You wouldn't give me much lovin'
Would I stay at home at night
Now I hear the train a comin'
And I'll soon be out of sight
You've been fooling me baby
You've been telling me your lies
When I thought you were an angel
Just sent down from the skies <start> There's a quarter moon breaking on the water tonight
I'm waiting here in second hand light
With no particular place to go
On the last bus home
There's a girl in the seat right across from me
She's about as done as she could be
Asleep on his shoulder but still she's alone
On the last bus home
People like me don't heed no direction
There's no real place we call home
You might catch our eye at a crossroads sometime
Then we're gone
There's a quarter moon breaking on the water tonight
I'm waiting here in second hand light
And truth is I've really got nowhere to go
On the last bus home <start> Four strong winds that blow lonely seven seas that run high
All these things that don't change come what may
But my good times are all gone and I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
I may go out to Alberta weather's good there in the fall
Got some friends that I can go to working for
Still I wish you'd change your mind if I asked you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more
 ac.guitar  dobro 
If I get there before the snow flies and the things are going good
You could join me if I sent you down the fare
But if you'll wait until it's winter it would do no good
For the winds sure can blow cold way out there
Four strong winds... <start> Won't it ever be morning won't the dawn ever break
Won't it ever quit hurting how much can I take
A man could go crazy in the shape that I'm in
I love you and miss you so much won't it ever be morning again
It's barely twelve o'clock but I've already spent a lifetime
Just sitting here and wishing it was any time but nighttime
Outside the winds are moaning low and I just heard it thunder
Your picture on the wall just laughed at me and I just wonder
Won't it ever be morning
I love you and miss you so much won't it ever be morning again <start> Where are you going Billy boy where are you going Billy Boy
I'm going to Atlanta let this farm just run on down
It's made all it can make but it don't go around
Do you want to go with me Mary Lou do you want to go with me Mary Lou
I'm not sure I could live there I don't have no city ways
And it's hard to leave where I was born and raised
Look at all those buildings Billy boy I think I'm gonna like it Billy boy
Look at all the bright lights the night seems just like day
It makes the farm seem so far away
Where are you going Mary Lou you're not going out again tonight are you
I didn't buy this
New dress just to sit and watch TV
I'm going out and let the town see me
Where are you going Billy boy where are you going Billy Boy
I'm going home back to that rundown farm
Where all the dirt is used for growing corn
Do you want to go with me Mary Lou <start> She saw him for the first time in that open all night diner
When she served him up some chili and a beer
And the feeling that she got when he grinned across the counter
Was across between excitement and the fear
He looked as hard and dry as the back roads that he traveled
Chasin' rodeos through half a hundred towns
He said hang up your apron honey and brush down your hair
And well go ya hooin' around
He's a true western movie without any star G's something like she's never known
But she's seen enough movies to know how they'll end
He'll ride into the sunset alone
He makes her feel like a kid cuttin' school
But by now she should be old enough to know
That today ain't forever and there's only so long
You can't take all your pleasures to go
But as long as it lasts she'll just keep hangin' on cause she's just along for the ride
And Lord if they fly to high and even if she falls all she can hurt is her pride
He's a true western movie <start> Their thoughts're all mingled their dreams all confused
Their minds and their bodies how they abuse
Searching for answers that doesn't grow there
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower
Their plans their desires and all of their hopes
Wither and die as they go up in smoke
Sharp as a needle and filled with despair
Such is the curse of the wild weed flower
From a moment of joy to a lifetime of sorrow
For one day of pleasure they trade their tomorrows
Lost in a garden where bulbs all grow
With blossoms of heartaches and petals of woe
Eyes full of emptiness just stand and stare
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower <start> I'm like the rain in a downpour
I wash away what you long for
And I wave goodbye with the sun in my eyes
I wish I could be there tonight
I'm like the wind in the canyon
I'm there when I'm gone in a second
You're growing older in peace where you're at
I wish I could be there for that
But I've moved on
Like a rolling stone
In a crowded room
I'm alone
I'm like the rain in a downpour
I wash away what you long for
And I wave goodbye with the sun in my eyes
I wish I could be there tonight
Oh oh yeah
You're like the tide in the deep blue
Cause you're always there when I need you
And when you need someone to carry you through
I'm gonna be there for you
I'm gonna be there for you <start> When God dips his pen of love into my heart
And writes my soul a message he wants me to know
His spirit all divine fills this sinful soul of mine when God dips his love in my heart
Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a living soul
How he brought salvation when he made me whole
But I found I couldn't hide such love as Jesus did impart
Well it makes me laugh it makes me cry it sets my sinful soul on fire
When God dips his love in my heart
Sometimes though the way is dreary dark and cold
And some unburdened sorrow keeps me from the goal
I go to God in prayer I can always find him there to whisper sweet peace to my soul
Well I said I wouldn't tell it
 <start> What do we call it now
It isn't marriage anymore
Call it new and different
It's not the way it was before
Out of all the words to choose from
There's only one that fits
Call it what you want to
I just call it quits
We've come down to the place
Where love barely fits
Call it what you want to
I call it quits
Turn and walk away
Across the desert of our hearts
Loves kinda said that we've run out of time
And though we once had something
No words could tear apart
Now you be your's and I'll be mine
We've come down to the place
Where love barely fits
Call it what you want to
I call it quits
Call our friends
And tell them
Oh tell them that we just don't care
Tell them dreams of flowers
But our garden's bare
Call it separation independence
Divorce if that word fits
Call it what you want to
I just call it quits
We've come down to the place
Where love barely fits
Call it what you want to
I call it quits <start> Another lonely night
And every passing hour
Makes it harder to fight
I'm still under your power
you've got a hold on me won't let me be
You're not even her I'm in love with the memory
Another morning alone
I don't even remember
How many battles you've won
And I can't even surrender
you've got a hold on me won't let me be
You're not even her I'm in love with the memory
Another day with the blues
Don't know how Ill get through it
I've got your memory to lose
And I don't know how to do it
you've got a hold on me won't let me be
You're not even her I'm in love with the memory
You're not even her I'm in love with the memory <start> Diamonds on the windshield as heaven starts to cry
In his rearview mirror his angle waves goodbye
She knows he's got to go she knows he's one of them
Chorus
Brothers of the highway children of the wind
That Detroit diesel pirate ship goes rollin' out again
Sailin' for that settin' sun freedoms your best friend
Brothers of the highway children of the wind.
He putts the peddle to the metal trying to out run the rain
Another shot of truck stop coffee goes runnin' through his veins
This country turns on eighteen wheels thank god we can depend on
Chorus
Carolina west to Denver Batton Rouge east to Pittsburgh Portland south to San Diego sail on sail on Tallahassee north to Boston up to
Bangor west to Austin coast to coast sea to sea sail on sail on you
Chorus
God bless you brothers of the highway children of the wind. <start>

But he says he don't really like no company he says he'd rather just dig
Gravedigger he got secrets he whispered as he lit up a cig
He said you gotta watch you don't badger the hole when you're cutting through the roots and twigs
He works right through in the darkness and then he stops and he takes him a swig
Drive by the right time of the night you might spy him in the moonlight doin' a jig

And we'll get married in the Spring

And I call her my little thingamajiggy
Every time I ask her for a kiss

 No help wanted

Well I can handle this job all by myself
 No sirree

We're gonna dance till the break of day
 No help wanted

I can handle this job all by myself
There's no help wanted <start> Don'ta forbid me to hold you tight
Darling Don't Forbid Me to hold you tight
Leta me hold you in my lovin' arms
'Cause it's cold and I can keep you warm
Don't a forbid me to kiss your lips
Darling Don't Forbid Me to kiss your lips
Leta me kiss you please baby please
'Cause it's cold and your lips might freeze.
There's a strong Westwind ablowing
and there's a big blue moon above
And pretty baby I'll be knowing
you need some heartwarming love
So don'ta forbid me to talk sweet talk
Darling Don't Forbid Me to talk sweet talk
Leta me fill your little heart with fire <start> I'm going to find me a dying river
And strike a deal with her I'll say
I'll fold you in two and I'll carry you away
To a place where your headwaters will flow
Clean through to your mouth
In return I'll request a small sanctuary
By her banks where we will live
With our small family she will water our garden
And clean the dirt from our skin
While the word clamors at our door
We will dance and not let them in
And if one day we wake up to a bed dry as a bone
Find our river stolen find our sanctuary gone
We will stand and take stock and be grateful
For what we've not lost
We will pack up our bags pack our small family
Head across the valley to where the aspen trees
Shiver as they ascend the green hills rising to blue
At the edge of the shopping we will turn
And bid fond and aumldieu
All that I know to be true
Is the touch of your hand on my skin
One look from you can so easily soothe
All this turmoil within
As we dance cheek to cheek
With our feet so completely
Locked in a time all our own
I stop to speak
But you gently keep me
Moving in time to the song
And in a voice that is sloppy with gin
You say Let the world spin
I'm going to find me a dying river
And strike a deal with her I'll say
And Iuml I'll fold you in two and I'll carry you away
To place where your headwaters will flow
Clean through to your mouth
In return I'll request a small sanctuary
By her banks where we will live
With our small family she will water our garden
And clean the dirt from our skin
While the world clamors at our door
We will dance and not let them in <start> When ya feeling inside out and insecure
When life keeps gettin' you down
When all life's daily worries hurry through your head
You don't want to even get up you just lye around in bed
When ya feel you just can't take it anymore
And you wonder what on earth it is all for
Your love life's like a war zone your tv's on the blink
It's enough to drive a drinkin' man to stop an' take a think <start> Late at night
Can't go to sleep
It's just me and the radio
Every single melody
Is wrecking me
And I know I'm getting close
To losing all control
And picking up the phone
I'm one song away
From breaking down and calling you up
And each one that plays is telling me that I'm still in love
Every word in every line
Is singing how I feel tonight
It's all I can take
Now I'm one song away
I'm just one song away
I could turn it off or tune it out
But I'm too gone for saving now so
What's the use
No matter what I try to do I'm back and forth
I toss and turn and think of you
The later that it gets
The more I wanna give in
I'm one song away
From breaking down and calling you up
And each one that plays is telling me that I'm still in love
Every word in every line
Is singing how I feel tonight
It's all I can take
Now I'm one song away
I'm just one song away
I'm one song away
Oh and every word in every line
Is singing how I feel tonight
It's all I can take
Now I'm one song away
I'm just one song away
Late at night
Can't go to sleep
It's just me and the radio <start> You told me that you'd love me until the end of time
But you are only human and humans change their minds
You left me without warning and the storm brought me pain
And down down down came the rain
All your love would bring a man so much happiness
That the heavens had to send the rain to divide it up I guess
I stumble through the darkness still calling your name
And down down down came the rain
All your love... <start> You always had
A way with words
So you can just imagine
When I heard
You say she would
Be your wife
Yeah it cut me
Like a knife
It wasn't very long ago
I was the one
You used to hold
All through the night
Yeah so this just
Doesn't seem right
I could try and
Win you back
But I'm the one who left
Guess I gotta accept
That now I'm
Chorus
Just another girl
Yeah I'm just another girl
I used to be the queen
I used to be the one
Who rocked your world
And now
I'm just another girl
Sure looks like
You adjusted well
For someone who swore
There was no one else
And I couldn't be replaced
That's obviously not the case
Peel away my coat of pride
You're bound to see the sting
Over some little ring
Now I'm
Chorus
Another time
Another place
Another girl
Another face
Chorus <start> You lit up the room simply by just walking in
The moment you entered I could have surrendered right then
Your silhouette was the vision in my every dream
And when our eyes met you shook the earth under me
My knees became weak and my heart started racing away
You left me breathless when I saw you heading my way
Holding you now well is all I can do to believe
If this isn't love baby don't wake me up from the dream
Cause baby you're turning and turning my world upside down
I should know better but there is no turning back now
And I never knew love to take so high
Take me to heaven and take me tonight
But whatever you do baby
Don't take your hands off my heart
The warmth of your touch is just too much for me to ignore
I've never know wanting you wanting me like this before
When all that's between you and I is the air that we breathe
The passion in you baby brings out the woman in me <start> This old Buick's like a needle on a compass
Pointed due west
I remember her smile like June sunflowers
And the look of her body as she slipped out of that dress
God I'm such a mess
Never a mornin' person but that girl's still in bed
The sheets are tanglin' her little arm is danglin'
The last dream from her pretty head
I told her I was leavin'
She didn't believe the words I said
Chorus
I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'
Back there again
She'll put on her makeup and drink from her tea cup
Glance at that silver frame
See I took our picture and then it'll hit her
She'll cry out with pain
Maybe whisper my name
Chorus
No one's gonna make me
Nothing's gonna take me
I ain't ever goin'
Back there again
Now don't blame her mama for makin' me promise
Don't come around here no more
She said Maybe your life's gone to hell
But that's a tour of duty she didn't sign up for
When you can't save yourself you save somebody else
Maybe that's how you survive
I'm runnin' away so she don't have to see
A life in slowmotion suicide
You throw in the towel they call you a coward
Tell ya fight don't cut and run
I ain't no hero but the truth is I know
It's the bravest thing I've ever done
The hardest part is knowing what we could have
Should have become
I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'
No one's gonna make me
Nothing's gonna take me
I ain't ever goin'
Goin'
To break her heart again <start> A hand to hold when things look down
And no one seems to care
A shoulder that is strong enough
For the burdens we must bear
A dream that reaches far and wide
So both of us can dare
A promise I will love and bide
That's all I have to share
A chance to sail among the stars
That few will ever see
To feel the deepest missing you
That most think cannot be
A heart that beats for only one
And loves you fast and true
A promise I will love and bide
That's all I have for you
These things I have to give to you
Their value isn't much
Just things that you can barely see
And rarely ever touch
A hand to hold when we're alone
And no one seems to care
A gentle touch to reassure
And tell you I'm still there
I try my best to reminisce
Our dreams that all came true
A promise I will love and bide
That's all I have for you
My promise I will love and bide
This I give to you <start>  Buddy Alan 
Just about a year ago I sat out on the road
Seeking my fame and fortune looking for a pot of gold
Things got bad and things got worse I guess you know the tune
Oh Lord I'm stuck in Lodi again
I rode in on the Greyhound I'll be walking out if I go
I was just passin' through must been seven months ago
I ran out of time and money it looks like they took my friend
Oh Lord I'm stuck in Lodi again
 keyboard 
The man from the magazine he said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connection I ran out of songs to play
I came into town a one night stand it looks like my plans fell through
Oh Lord I'm stuck in Lodi again
 guitar 
If I only had a dollar for every song I've sung
Every time I pass the place while people sat there drunk
You know I'd catch the next train back to where I lived
Oh Lord I'm stuck in Lodi again oh Lord I'm stuck in Lodi again
Oh Lord I'm stuck in Lodi again <start> Dynamite and whiskey
It's all the same
Tobacco in the sunshine
Sleeping in the rain
Jesus said for sure
He's coming back again
Dynamite and whiskey
It's all the same
Ain't no tomorrow
Hold me with no eyes
Stand back away
And you'll wait for a ride
Stand by the water
And you'll whisper something
Dynamite and whiskey
It's all the same
Rub it in your blood
Rub it on your mind
When she wipes just flapping out of time
I seen some things I won't see again
It's all the same
It's all the same
I think it's gonna rain
Dynamite and whiskey
It's all the same
Tobacco in the sunshine
Sleepin in the rain
Stand by the water
And you'll whisper something
Dynamite and whiskey
It's all the same
It's all the same
It's all the same
It's all the same
Dynamite and whiskey
It's all the same
It's all the same <start> I strike a match to an old love letter
Another weak attempt at lettin' go
I try to put myself together
I know I'm not even close
The time will come
When I turn your memory loose
But I can't think about that now
No not now
Well I'll burn that bridge when I get there
When the fire for you has burned out
Well I'll walk across and cut my loss
The day that I no longer care
Well I'll burn that bridge when I get there
When you walked out you took off runnin'
Your heart found another home
Now you look at me like we had nothin'
I wish that I could be that cold
When I don't shake at the mention of your name
That's when I'll finally write you off
I'll write you off
Well I'll burn that bridge when I get there
When the fire for you has burned out
Well I'll walk across and cut my loss
The day that I no longer care
Well I'll burn that bridge when I get there <start> I remember working on a rooftop
In the hot summer sun all day
Now I work two hours a night
It feels a lot more like play
'Fore Kenny joined the band
He used to hang dry wall
Ben worked down at Valentino's
So when you see us up here and think
Man they're lucky
You don't have to tell us 'cause we know
Chorus
Yeah we're laughing all the way to the bank
'Cause it all just seems so funny
A bunch of guys like us
In a big tour bus
Making that easy money
Desperado hauled cattle
Grady drove trucks
Justin had a hotdog stand
Kevin sold records
And Brent sold shoes
And Gary was a garbage man
Chorus
I used to have an exgirlfriend
That didn't understand
She said Boy you're going nowhere fast
You oughta get a real job
Why don't you quit that band
Now she can kiss my backstage pass
Chorus x <start> Once I stood in the night with my head bowed low
In the darkness as black as the sea
And my heart was afraid and I cried
Oh Lord don't hide your face from me.
Hold my hand all the way every hour every day
From here to the great unknown
Take my hand let me stand
Where no one stands alone.
 Instrumental 
Like a king I may live in a palace so tall
With great riches to call my own
But I don't know a thing in this whole wide world
That's worse than being alone. <start> She's got an eightythree two eighty z just twenty three
Lives on nd street Paris Tennessee
Exactly nine hundred twenty four feet from her door to mine
Seven days a week at six a.m. she gets her five miles in
All the neighborhood men pretend to get their paper
When she goes running by
She don't see it but it's obvious
To everybody else it all adds up
One Miss America smile two blue eyes
Three little words I'm telling her tonight
She's cooler than cool and hotter than the th of July
She's five foot six and she's gonna look great
I'm seven minutes early for an eight o'clock date
She's one hot number hallelujah amen
She's a hard nine working on ten
She's a first round knock out down for the count
Loud twist and shouter a keg of gunpowder
Sparks fly around her twenty four hours a day
She's smart and funny ooh honey smack dab on the money
Summa cum laude a smart little hottie
Who would have thought she'd ever even look my way
I'm a lucky man there ain't no doubt
It ain't that hard to figure out
One Miss America smile two blue eyes
Three little words I'm telling her tonight
She's cooler than cool and hotter than the th of July
She's five foot six and she's gonna look great
I'm seven minutes early for an eight o'clock date
She's one hot number hallelujah amen
She's a hard nine working on ten
There's no such thing as true perfection
But she might be the one exception
She's got one Miss America smile two blue eyes
Three little words I'm telling her tonight
She's cooler than cool and hotter than the th of July
She's five foot six and she's gonna look great
I'm seven minutes early for an eight o'clock date
She's one hot number can I get an amen
She's a hard nine working on ten
Yeah she's a hard nine working on ten <start> If I could be the reason your hair's a mess
The bass drum beatin' way down deep in your chest
If I could be the voice on your radio
Then I could be your long ride home.
If mine could be the name that changes yours
The wine in your glass
The swing on your porch
The dollar in your pocket and the peaceful in your sleep
Then I'd be what you mean to me.
Standing here
Watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low
Dancin slow
Oh if falling's how you feel
And perfect is what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me.
Oh yeah
If I could be the fire in your firefly
The cool in the rain
The spark in your eye
The answer to your prayer
And the faith that sets you free
Then I'd be what you mean to me.
Standing here
Watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low
Dancin slow
Oh if falling's how you feel
And perfect is what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me
What you mean to me
And oh all of this talkin' makes you laugh
But I've gotta let you know just how I feel
Eel eel while I'm standing here
Watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
And the lights down low
Dancin slow
Oh if falling's how you feel
And perfect is what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me.
Yeah falling's how you feel
And perfect's what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me.
Be what you mean to me.
Oh be what you mean what you mean what you mean
What you mean to me
Hmm <start> I just got your letter dearest sweetheart and darling I miss you oh so much
Your letter has cheered me but I'm lonesome lonesome just to feel your loving touch
Letters have no arms dear to hold me kisses on paper are so cold
These sweet things you write in your letter I want to be with you dear been told
Letters never bring me the touch of your hand or none of your sweet loving charms
I get so lonesome for you darling and you know that letters have no arms
Letters never bring me <start> I still talk to you in my sleep
I don't say much 'cause the hurt runs too deep
I gave you the moon and the stars to keep
But you gave them back to me
The hill I'm walkin' up is gettin' good and steep
But I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep
I still lay on my side of the bed
I dance alone when the last bottle's spent
Memories like a river runnin' through my head
I'll have me an ocean before I'm dead
The hill I'm walkin' up is gettin' good and steep
But I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep
I still whisper sweet words to you
And when I'm busy with nothing to do
I pray to God that my words ring true
And that your words might reach me too
The hill I'm walkin' up is gettin' good and steep
But I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep
I can't keep it
My heart's in pieces so please understand
I'm tryin' to jump but I've nowhere to land
So give me your heart and I'll give you my hand
And try as goddamn hard as I can
The hill I'm walkin' up is gettin' good and steep
But I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep
I can't keep it <start> I can hardly bare the sight of lipstick
On the cigarettes there in the ashtray
Lyin' cold the way you left them
But at least your lips caressed them while you packed
And a lip print on a halffilled cup of coffee
That you poured and didn't drink
But at least you thought you wanted it
That's so much more than I can say for me
It's been a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
Funny I don't even care
When you turned and walked away
And as the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses
After three full years of marriage
It's the first time that you haven't made the bed
I guess the reason we're not talkin'
There's so little left to say we haven't said
While a million thoughts go racin' through my mind
I find I haven't spoke a word
And from the bedroom those familiar sounds
Of our one baby's cryin' goes unheard
But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
Funny I don't even care
When you turned and walked away
And as the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses <start> Bring your love to me
I will hold it like a newborn child
One of my own blood
And I might just even sing a song
to keep it calm
If you're wondering am I capable
God knows I am
And if it's meant to be
I will go alone God knows I can
Just not as well and besides what kind of fun is there
to be had with no one else
And I can only stand here still
And I can only hope you will
keep me in focus long enough to tell
I'm trying to help 
Bring your love to me
I will hold it like a dandelion
One I want to save one I want to keep
from the breeze that follows me and no one else <start> WRONG ROAD AGAIN

I can't seem to learn not to love you you get to me every time
You're someone I just can't say no to you're so good at changin' my mind
Here I go down that wrong road again goin' back where I've already been
Even knowing where it will end here I go down that wrong road again
Though I see the web that you're weavin' you and your soft easy line
Before I stop to think I'm believin' and I'm fallin' for you one more time
Here I go down that wrong road again...
Here I go down that wrong road again...
Here I go down that wrong road again... <start> Yes I know that my baby's been steppin' out used to be my darlin'
Her old flame keeps comin' right back again botherin' my baby
I tried to hold my head up high look my friends right in the eye
But way down deep inside it hurts me so
Her old used to be is on the pout again botherin' my baby
I have worried now so long dear it's driving me crazy
But I won't ever pout neither my darlin' I cannot shout
'Cause I know that my baby's steppin' out
Her old used to be <start> I'll never love no one else but my darlin'
Even though we both had to part
I'll never love no one else but my darlin'
Where ever she goes she'll always have my heart
As most people say absence makes the heart grow cold
But the kind of love we had each other's heart will hold
I'll never love no one else but my darlin'
As we travel down two different lonesome roads
I'll never let no one take your place my darlin'
For you know you meant the world to me
I'll never let no one tale your place my darlin'
For your love won't let my heart be free <start> 
Yea my bucket's got a hole in it
Yea my bucket's got a hole in it
Yea my bucket's got a hole in it
I can't buy no beer.
Well I'm standin' on a corner  with a bucket in my hand
I'm waitin' for a woman  that ain't got no man.
Cause my bucket's got a hole in it
Yea my bucket's got a hole in it
Yea my bucket's got a hole in it
I can't buy no beer.
Well I went upon the mountain  I looked down in the sea
I seen the crabs and the fishes  doin' the bebopbee.
Well there ain't no use  of me workin' so hard
When I got a woman  in the boss man'syard.
Well me and my baby  we just bought a ford
And now we sit together  on the running board. <start> Just about two hundred years ago they signed that declaration
Tellin' everybody in the whole wide world
They're gonna start a brand new nation
From that day on the th of July has been a holiday
To the rich man poor man and everybody else but the cowboys in the RCA
Well I get on the phone and call the airlines
Rentacars and Greyhound stations
Cause I've entered bout thirteen rodeos out across the great big nation
Got the car tuned up
The tanks full of gas
I've got money in my hand
And if I ain't overdrawn by the end of the week
At the bank I'm a lucky man
Chorus
It's the th of July on the rodeo trail
It'll drive you insane
My wife's worried home by the telephone
I'm on the road again
It's the Forth of July on the rodeo trail if I ever make it home I swear
I'm gonna to hang up my hat
Put up my riggin' sack
And for a month I'm gonna stay right there
Well I've been on the road about three days now
And I haven't had a minutes rest
There's dark circles all around my bloodshot eyes
And my face is now a whiskered mess
Boy I'd sure like a bath and a home cooked meal
But for now I must be satisfied
With this double superduper half cooked burger
And a side of grease soaked french fries
Well the week's nearly over and I wonder to myself will I ever make it home alive
When a bronc fell on me up in Calgary
When he slipped tryin' to make his high dive
And the plane and the pilot that we rented looked like surplus from World War I
And I thought any times about suicide
But I haven't found myself a gun
Chorus <start> In This World I Walk Alone
With No Place To Call My Home
But Theres One Who Holds My Hand
On The Rugged Road Through Barren Lands
The Way Is Dark The Road Is Steep
But Hes Become My Eyes To See
Strength To Climb My Grief To Bear
The Savior Lives Inside Me There
In Your Love I Find Release
A Haven From My Unbelief
Take My Life And Let Me Be
A Living Prayer My God To Thee
Through These Trials Of Life I Find
Another Voice Inside My Mind
It Comforts Me And Bids Me Live
Inside The Love The Father Gives
In Your Love I Find Release
A Haven From My Unbelief
Take My Life And Let Me Be
A Living Prayer My God To Thee
Take My Life And Let Me Be
A Living Prayer My God To Thee <start> 
Last night I dreamed that I was a child
Out where the pines grow wild and tall
I was trying to make it home through the forest
Before the darkness falls
I heard the wind rustling through the trees
And ghostly voices rose from the fields
I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path
With the devil snappin' at my heels
I broke through the trees and there in the night
My father's house stood shining hard and bright
The branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms
But I ran till I fell shaking in his arms
I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart
Will never again sir tear us from each other's hearts
I got dressed and to that house I did ride
From out on the road I could see its windows shining in light
I walked up the steps and stood on the porch
A woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door
I told her my story and who I'd come for
She said I'm sorry son but no one by that name lives here anymore
My father's house shines hard and bright
It stands like a beacon calling me in the night
Calling and calling so cold and alone
Shining 'cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned <start> Hold up there you go again
Puttin' on that smile again
Even though I know you've had a bad day
Doin' this and doin' that
Always puttin' yourself last
A whole lotta give and not enough take
But you can only be strong so long before you break
So fall go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine
I'll catch you every time you fall
Go on and lose it all
Every doubt every fear every worry every tear
I'm right here
Baby fall
Forget about the world tonight
All that's wrong and all that's right
Lay your head on my shoulder let it fade away
And if you wanna let go baby it's okay
Fall go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine
I'll catch you every time you fall
Go on and lose it all
Every doubt every fear every worry every tear
I'm right here
Baby fall
Hold on hold on hold on to me
Fall go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine
I'll catch you every time you fall
Go on and lose it all
Every doubt every fear every worry every tear
I'm right here
Baby fall <start> While driving down the last four miles of gravel road to home
All the old familiar landmarks seem like long lost friends
As he pulls in to the ranch he see's his mom hangin' out the wash
And dad is ridin' down the old yellow with old smokie
He never realized what a good cook his mom was
I guess he took a lot of things for granite
But for the past year he has been living on blogne burgers and beans
And he thinks he just might stay home for awhile
Well there's a dance in town tonight
And he figures he'll just go in and see some of his old friends
Well he runs into Bill and John and they ask
Where all he's been and about the bulls
Well then from behind him he hears someone call his name
He turns around to see a beautiful young lady
He doesn't recognise him at first but then it dawns on him
This is the same skinny little girl who use to tag along with him back in high school
My how the flowers grow well they danced and talked about things
And somewhere around midnight for the first time in his life
The cowboy realizes he is fallin' in love
And you know what I guess it was bound to happen <start> There's a place down the street we call Sam's Place.
It starts ajumpin' every evening when the sun goes down.
You can always find me down at Sam's Place
For that's where the gang all hangs around.
There's ol' Shimmy Shakin' Tina
She hails from Pasadena.
She always got a big smile on her face.
There's Hootchwhykootchy Hattie she comes from Cincinnati
Yeah there's always a party at Sam's Place.
Well they've got a swingin' band down at Sam's Place.
You can hear 'em pickin' twenty blocks away.
They're playin' country music down at Sam's Place
From the setting sun until the break of day.
There's ol' Shimmy Shakin' Tina
She hails from Pasadena.
She always got a big smile on her face.
There's Hootchwhykootchy Hattie she comes from Cincinnati
Yeah there's always a party at Sam's Place. <start> Got to get out more
Get in the place
Got to work out more
And sort out my face
I've got all the enzines that tell me what to eat
And I'm tired of being told what to wear on my feet
And I don't have the time to get all worked up
About the year on the street
Chorus
And it's not my fault I can find my way
Yeah it's not my fault there goes another day
I've been here too long do I have to change
Into what it takes
To make it number one
I feel out of favour
I don't look like a picture
You think I'm a loser
But I can see through you
You're running around like you're running the country
I know that you think that you've got one on me
Ear to the ground like the boy about town
Can't get nothing to fit me
Chorus <start> Tonight I'm sad my heart is weary
Wondering if I'm wrong or right
To think about you though you left me
I wonder where you are tonight
The rain is cold and slowly falling
Upon my window pane tonight
And though your love seems even colder
I wonder where you are tonight
Your heart was cold you never loved me
Though you often said you cared
And now you've gone to find another
Someone who knows the love I shared
Then came the dawn the day you left me
I tried to smile with all my might
But you could see the pain within me
That lingers in my heart tonight <start> Please don't start me cryin'
'Cause I'll go on for days
It don't take a lot
But once this starts it stays
Talking used to help
Here lately though
that just brings it on
Chorus
I'll be fine
In time
But right now
I'm just trying to forget you
And clearly I have yet to
Succeed
I think I'll just leave now
Before this hurts too much
Avoiding sights from places
My eyes can't bear to touch
I didn't plan to see you
And then I saw him first
Chorus <start> Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say Are you married
We'll say No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town.
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down.
When it snows ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland. <start> I can see you are not happy the way you've been acting
And I think you'd like to be free
I know he's a good man but I know that you can be a whole lot happier with me
In your eyes there's a yearning and inside you're a burning
And I'd like to put out the flame
So let's get together like birds of a feather and we let the love take the blame
But right now I don't think that I can leave him for lately he's been so good to me
And there might be once more chance that things might work out
So let's wait a little longer then we'll see
But the way I can make you forget him cause I'll take you
To places that you've never been
We'll may call the night spots the dim and the bright spots
And then we'll forget where we've been
We'll walk sunny beaches and taste Georgia peaches and swing from Maine to Mexico
If you'll come along we can make life a song and you won't be tied down anymore
But still I don't think that I can leave him for lately he's been so good to me
And there might be once more chance that things might work out
So let's wait a little longer then we'll see yes let's wait a little longer then we'll see <start> Yeah that's my old girlfriend
Saw her when she walked in
Her hair's a little longer but she's still lookin' stronger than sin
No I don't care if you buy her a drink
But she's not the kind of girl you think
Oh cause back when we were lovin' she thought cowboys were something
Now' they ain't
Cause she's over buckles
She's over spurs
To her you're just a heartache in a pearl snap shirt
Been lassoed and let go for the last time
No she ain't just over me she's over me and my kind
I guess I ruined it for the rest of us
When I left her standing in my dust
Oh and lately she's been hating rodeos and Copenhagen
And trucks haha
Yeah she's over buckles
She's over spurs
To her you're just a heartache in a pearl snap shirt
Been lassoed and let go for the last time
No she ain't just over me she's over me and my kind
Yeah she's over buckles
She's over spurs
To her you're just a heartache in a Wrangler pearl snap shirt
Lassoed and let go for the last time
She ain't just over me she's over me and my kind
She ain't just over me she's over me and my kind <start> MY LITTLE BUCKAROO

' copyright control
Close your sleepy eyes my little Buckaroo
While the light of western skies is shining down on you
Don't you know it's time for bed another day is through
So go to sleep my little Buckaroo
Soon you're gonna ride the rails like grown up cowboys do
Now it's time that you were roundin' up a dream or two
So go to sleep my little Buckaroo mhm
Goodnight sleep tight don't you realize my little Buckaroo
It was from my little acorn that the oak tree grew
And remember Buffalo Bill was once a kid like you
So go to sleep my little Buckaroo mhm goodnight sleep tight <start> You wake up in the morning and clear your head
You sometimes think you'd be better off dead
You drive to work in a beat up car
You know where you're going but you don't know where you are
You might think you could be happy someday
but you don't know how to look the other way...
What do you see
When the sun don't shine and you cannot find your way
What do you see
When the rain falls down onto the ground each day
You work a crap job you don't know why
You follow your orders you never blink an eye
You listen to them scream and you listen to them yell
You watch them create your own little private hell
You might think you could be happy someday
But you don't know how to look the other way
What do you see
When the sun don't shine and you cannot find your way
What do you see
When the rain falls down onto the ground each day
You go to bed but you cannot sleep
You wonder how you're gonna make it through the week
You finally doze off you fall into a dream
You are the puppet who wants to cut its strings
What do you see
When the sun don't shine and you cannot find your way
What do you see
When the rain falls down onto the ground each day <start> I can hear the voice of the boatman comin'
And I'll be ready when he calls my name
So happy I'll be on my way to Heaven
I hear the Angels freely say
Oh the boat of love down at the harbor
It's waiting there for you and me
I have no fear Christ is the captain
He'll guide us o'r life's rollin' sea
Let's get on board that great excursion
And sail the sea to the home above
Don't wait too late to make your reservation
It's the boat of God's eternal love
Oh the boat of love will soon be sailing
It's headin' for that golden shore
Don't wait too late to make your reservation
Heaven is my home for evermore <start> You're an educated mama ain't that a heck of a note
Just cause I got no learnin' to sit around and float
You're an educated mama readin' night and day
If you knew how I could love you you throw them books away
I know you're educated your learnings really show
But how to make me happy is somethin' you don't know
You're an educated mama readin' night and day
If you knew how I could love you you throw them books away
Your look's so somethin' special your figure is delicious
But you're colder as a iceberg and romantic as a fish
You're an educated mama readin' night and day
If you knew how I could love you you throw them books away
I'm goin' to the graveyard and dig a place I found
For anyone as dead as you belongs deep in the ground
You're an educated mama readin' night and day
If you knew how I could love you you throw them books away <start> There are stars in the southern sky southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees down the seven bridges road
Now I have loved you like a baby like some lonesome child
I have loved you in a tame way and I have loved you wild
Sometimes there's a part of me has to turn from here and go
Running like a child beneath warm stars down the seven bridges road
 strings 
Now there are stars in the southern sky and if ever you decide you should go
There is a taste of time sweetened honey down the seven bridges road <start> If there's a chance that your heart misses the words I try to say with kisses
If I don't seem to be as happy as I should
I wouldn't want to live without you I love everything about you
Yes even the bad times are good
Oh your middle name should be perfection cause that's what you are to me
Even in my darkest moments you made it easier to see
I wouldn't change one thing about you if I knew that I could
Yes even the bad times are good
You never let me feel mistreated your love is all I ever needed
When I was weak somehow you always understood
We're not afraid of stormy weather
That's what keeps our love together
Yes even the bad times are good yes even the bad times are good <start> Lying beside you here in the dark
Feeling your heart beat with mine
Softly you whisper you're so sincere
How could our love be so blind
We sailed on together and drifted apart
And here you are by my side
So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what you're love means to me
Open arms
Living without you living alone
This empty house is so cold
Wanting to hold you wanting you near
How much I've wanted you home
But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay
So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what you're love means to me
Open arms <start> Peggy Sue rode away last night on a rocking horse
Straight into the pale moonlight make believe of course
But what's a little girl of eight
Supposed to do when she's up so late
She can't sleep 'cause it sounds like hate
Coming from her momma and daddy's room
Chorus
Ride on ride on
Out to where it don't hurt no more
Ride on come on
Back to how it was before
Your momma left and your daddy cussed
All they ever seem to do is fuss ride on
Tommy Lee's got a space machine
He keeps it ready on the launching pad
'Cause there've been times that he has seen
An alien invade his dad
So he heads out for the stars
Past the moon and straight to Mars
But what about the invisible scars
That come in a bottle that his daddy brings home
Chorus
Ride on ride on
Out to where it don't hurt no more
Ride on come on
Back to how it was before
Your momma left and your daddy changed
You don't even know who's to blame so ride on
Bridge
Some people just lose control some people hit overload
Some people act like some people they never thought they'd be
So why can't we all see
The only antidote The only way to cope
The only true hope is love
So everybody won't you
Chorus
Ride on ride on
Out to where it don't hurt no more
Ride on come on
Back to how it was before
Go ahead and test your faith
There's still a lot of hope it's never too late
To ride on the wings of love ride on <start> I hear footsteps in the street below me just an echo in the cold and lonely rain
And my heart breaks with every step that's taken me
As he walk on out to me at midnight train
Midnight train midnight train I know you've always been on time
But just as once I wish you'd pass this town on by
Cause if I had just one more day he might change his mind and stay
And those footsteps would be walking back to me
Oh how I love him with all the love that's in me
Oh I need him more than flowers need the rain
Gentle hands that just held me so tightly
Are reaching out to take that midnight train
Midnight train midnight train
And those footsteps would be walking back to me <start> When it's decoration day up in Heaven
There's a bouquet I'm longing to see
There's a flower somewhere in this bouquet
And means all the world to me
Now tonight the old home place's lonely
Since Mother has been called away
And I know I can never more see her
'Til we meet on that decoration day
When it's decoration day up in Heaven
There's a bouquet I'm longing to see
There's a flower somewhere in this bouquet
And means all the world to me
I remember the night the angels called her
To live on that beautiful shore
It left us so lonely here without her
It can never be home anymore <start> Your lion has left the ring now
Blood there in the dust
Every jaw hanging open
Look on if you must
How are you dreaming
High on your hill
Gold in the turning light
I remember it still
Up there somewhere in the ether
Summers without shoes
Now you're here with the danger
Things you cannot do
How are you dreaming
High on your hill
Gold in the turning light
I remember it still
I remember it still
I remember it still <start> Well I don't know why you left me but I do know that your gone
Over night you turned my life into a sad ol' song And one way or another
I gotta get over you Well there's only one thing left for me to do Lord
I don't wanna die of a broken heart That would be too sad Or drive my car off a cliff
Well that would just hurt too bad And if I tied a rope around my neck
I couldn't get my breath Well I think I'll just honkytonk myself to death
Well I may get a little bit crazy but I don't wanna go insane Young women and ole whisky
Well it just may kill the pain I'm gonna find the highest barstool and climb up to the top.
I think I'll just drink and twostep until I drop Lord
I don't wanna die of a broken heart That would be too sad Or drive my car off a cliff
Well that would just hurt too bad And if I tied a rope around my neck
I couldn't get my breath Well I think I'll just honkytonk myself to death
And if I tied a rope around my neck
I couldn't get my breath Well I think I'll just honkytonk myself to death Yeah
I think I'll honkytonk myself to death <start> Memories that linger in my heart
Memories that make my heart grow cold
But some day they'll live again sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold
When my blue moon turns to gold again
When the rainbow turns the clouds away
When my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay
 steel 
The lips that used to thrill me so
Your kisses were meant for only me
In my dreams they live again sweetheart
But my golden moon is just a memory
The castles we built of dreams together
Were the sweetest stories ever told
Maybe we will live them all again
And my blue moon again will turn to gold
When my blue moon turns to gold again... <start> By Richard Dobson
I CAN FEEL YOUR ARMS AROUND ME
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY
I CAN FEEL YOUR BREATHING NEXT TO ME
AND HEAR YOUR LAUGHTER GAY
YOU TRIED TO TELL ME WHAT WAS RIGHT
AND I TOLD YOU WHAT WAS REAL
ALL I EVER LIVE FOR NOW
IS THIS PIECE OF WOOD AND STEEL
IN A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF TROUBLE
A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF PAIN
LORD MANY FALL BESIDE THE ROAD
AND THEY NEVER RISE AGAIN
MANY MORE ARE BENDING LOW
OR BROKEN AT THE WHEEL
ALL I NEED TO CARRY ON
IS THIS PIECE OF WOOD AND STEEL
I WAS BORN MY MOTHER'S ONLY SON
SHE LOVES ME ALL SHE CAN
BUT THERE ISN'T MUCH TO SAY TO HER
SINCE I BECAME A MAN
AND I OFTEN MET THE DEVIL
BUT I NEVER MADE A DEAL
I JUST THANK THE LORD FOR HANDS TO PLAY
THE PIECE OF WOOD AND STEEL
IT'S FACE IS SCARRED AND BEATEN
LIKE THE RAGGED CLOTHES I WEAR
LIKE THE BODY THAT GOD GAVE ME
I MIGHT GIVE IT BETTER CARE
BUT I PLAY IT FOR THE LADIES
AND I PLAY IT FOR A MEAL
I PLAY THE STRINGS JUST TO HEAR 'EM RING
ON THIS PIECE OF WOOD AND STEEL
I'M GROWING TIRED OF SEARCHING NOW
THERE'S NOTHING MUCH I CRAVE
GIVE OR TAKE A LITTLE TIME
AND YOU CAN WRITE IT ON MY GRAVE
THERE'S NOTHING MORE I CARE TO OWN
NOTHING LEFT TO FEEL
ALL I EVER WANTED
WAS THIS PIECE OF WOOD AND STEEL
IN A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF TROUBLE
A WORLD THAT'S FULL OF PAIN
LORD MANY FALL BESIDE THE ROAD
AND THEY NEVER RISE AGAIN
MANY MORE ARE BENDING LOW
OR BROKEN AT THE WHEEL
ALL I NEED TO CARRY ON
IS THIS PIECE OF WOOD AND STEEL
I WAS BORN MY MOTHER'S ONLY SON
SHE LOVES ME ALL SHE CAN
BUT THERE ISN'T MUCH TO SAY TO HER
SINCE I BECAME A MAN
AND I OFTEN MET THE DEVIL
BUT I NEVER MADE A DEAL
I JUST THANK THE LORD FOR HANDS TO PLAY
THE PIECE OF WOOD AND STEEL
I'LL BE PLAYING THIS GUITAR TILL THE DAY I DIE <start> Look around any old crowded bar
You'll see a million reason a million scars
You can hear what the body language has to say
A good libation in celebration a dedication in desperation
If you wanna know why I'm here let me count the ways
I only need one good reason to keep on drinkin'
So I'll have one more I'm not done
Well I'm toast I'll toast every little thing around
Until the memories are all gone
I can't think of one thing wrong
With drinkin' and thinkin' of the one good reason I have
And it's a big one
I keep pourin' it in I don't think it shows
There's a hole in my heart where all the whiskey goes
I try fillin' it up but it just seems to go right through
Drink as I may no matter what I do
Never seem to need a reason number two
I count it all on one finger
It's always pointin' right at you
Now let me hear you drinkers
I only need one good reason to keep on drinkin'
So I have one more I'm not done
I'll be non stop bottoms up callin' for another round
Until the memories are all gone
I can't think of one thing wrong
With drinkin' and thinkin' of the one good reason I have
And it's a big one
Now there's all kinds of reasons good and bad
There's about twentyseven that my brother had
I'd a had 'em all rather than the one I have
I wouldn't be here countin' in the aftermath
But I need only one good reason to keep on drinkin'
So I have one more I'm just drinkin'
And thinkin' of one good reason I have
And it's a big one
It's a big one I'll tell ya it's a big one
Oh brother it's a big one <start> You can't hardly wait till I get home
You go through my clothes where to find two combs
And you ain't lookin' for the wear and tear when you do
If you don't quit checkin' on me I'm checkin' out on you
Ain't nothin' in my pockets but the car keys and a dollar
Note you're gonna find on my shirt is the rain around the collar
And baby that's somethin' that can only be on you
If you don't quit checkin' on me I'm checkin' out on you
Now I can't even stop off for a beer
Cause the bartender's gettin' tired of sayin' ET ain't here
And if you cuss me then what am I gonna do
If you don't quit checkin' on me I'm checkin' out on you
 guitar  steel 
Now I can't even stop off... <start> I came home last night to a dark and lonely cottage
I took the wreath off the door and somehow I stumbled inside
I just can't I just can't I said live without her
Give me one reason to live now that my darling has died
And then five little fingers touched my hand
Five little fingers too young to understand
And there was a softness in my little girl's touch
That seemed to say daddy I need you so
And in five little seconds her five little fingers told me all that I wanted to know
I could tell her little eyes were full of questions
I tried to answer but all I could do was hold her tight
Forgive me forgive me I said for crying
But darling your daddy has got such a load on his shoulders tonight
And then five little fingers soft and dear
Touched me on the cheek and gently brushed away a tear
And I knew that in her own little way my baby was saying daddy I love you so
It only took five little seconds for her five little fingers
To tell me all that I needed to know
 <start> When you live in the country
Everybody is your neighbor
On this one thing you can rely
They'll all come to see you
And never ever leave you
Sayin' you all come to see us by and by
Why'all come 
Why'all come 
Well you all come to see us now and then
Why'all come 
Why'all come 
Well you all come to see us when you can
Kin folks acomin'
They're comin' by the dozen
Eatin' everything from soup to hay
And right after dinner
They ain't looking any thinner
And here's what you hear them say
Why'all come 
Why'all come 
Well you all come to see us now and then
Why'all come 
Why'all come 
Well you all come to see us when you can
Grandma's awishin'
They'd come to the kitchen
And help do the dishes right away
But they all start aleavin'
But even though she's grievin'
You can still hear Grandma say
Why'all come 
Why'all come 
Well you all come to see us now and then
Why'all come 
Why'all come 
Well you all come to see us when you can <start> Struck by the sight of waking dreams
At hand our time's before our eyes
Called out to look beyond what seemed
To hear the woe an angel cry
In the distance the sun rose
Near we heard a clock chime
But the breeze murmured not yet
For there still is just a very little time
Our faces drenched by pouring rain
We laughed as closely we had clung
Our senses keen from lack of pain
Our souls the streams of songs we sung
Now the shadings around us
Judged yet not by our sight
In the light of our questing
The truth came through more clearly into sight
Around the eyes of disbelief
Intoxicated by their doubt
Moreover offered no relief
Afraid to look for finding out
Yet some danced and some sang songs
And some live for today
And around us the windows
Of wonder were unshuttered on our way <start> 
If there ever was an angel then surely you must be one
If there ever was a perfect love when I look at you I see one
If there's heaven on earth then this must surely be
And I want you to be the last one to touch me
The last thing I remember before I go to sleep
Is the touch of your sweet lips softly kissing me
And I go to sleep athinking how happy you make me
And I want you to be the last one to touch me
And when it's time to lay me down for my eternal sleep
Once more let your fingers softly touch my cheek
If I know that you have touched me then I can sleep in peace
And I want you to be the last one to touch me
And when the night is over and time will be no more
They say that we shall meet again upon the golden shore
And so when I awaken from my eternal sleep
I want you to be the first one to touch me
I want you to be the first the last the only one to touch me <start> Buddy some Topeka night
When its just you and the road
Seen no tailights there for miles
And nothin much but static on the radio
Wasnt lookin to the left
Wasnt lookin to the right
Just kept walking like Virginia to the surf
Towards the far end of the night
Time hangs like a noose
Before me
Time stills to a crawl
Grinds so slowly
Heard my own beloved cry
I heard my one beloved moan
Whats the use in all the ache we must endure
I had no good reason why
Time hangs like a noose
Before me
Time stills to a crawl
Grinds so slowly
Not a rail to grasp ahold
Nor a savior there beside
Juat kept a walkin like Virginia to the surf
Towards the far end of the night
Time hangs like a noose
Before me
Time stills to a crawl
Grinds so slowly
And time hangs like a noose
Around me <start> I am weak but Thou art strong Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long as I walk let me walk close to Thee
Just a closer walk with Thee grant it Jesus is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee let it be dear Lord let it be
When my feeble life is o'er time for me will be no more
Guide me gently safely o'er to Thy kingdom shore to Thy shore
Just a closer walk with Thee... <start> I tried ice cold silver bullet Cuervo gold
But it don't seem to fix the situation
I've tried self help
Got a hundred books up on my shelf
I practice transcendental meditation
But she's gone
She's still gone
I need something that'll take me back to the night she left
Rewind the sound of every step
I wanna watch her walking backwards back to me
I need something that'll stop the world throw it in the books
Undo the wrong unsavory words
What I really need are roses and a time machine
Now I'm on Craigslist looking for Deloreans
And brushing up on my education
Turns out there's time space black holes that lead back to the place before
I made a mess abominations
I need something that'll take me back to the night she left
Rewind the sound of every step
I wanna watch her walking backwards back to mee
I need something that'll stop the world throw it in the books
Undo the wrong unsavory words
What I really need are roses and a time machine
Now don't say it's impossible no way
Now don't say it's impossible no way
Now don't  say  it's impossible no way
Now don't  say  it's impossible
I need something that'll take me back to the night she left
Rewind the sound of every step
I wanna watch her walking backwards back to me
I need something that'll stop the world throw it in the books
Undo the wrong unsavory words
What I really need are roses and a time machine
Roses and a time machine
Roses and a time machine
Roses and a time machine <start> I know you love a little late night
Just me and you glowing with the brake light
Silhouettes sipping with a halo

Til the sky gets lit til the sunlight hits yeah
Whoa oh oh I've been given whoa oh oh a piece of heaven

You're my angel you're my angel tonight <start> Oh lord I stand before you
A past I can't deny
A sinner from the old school
Repent before you die
I tried to run
I tried to hide
I tried so hard to stray
But your love has found
Its way around
And grace has paved the way
Chorus
No more to roam
I've found my home
Hallelujah in my heart
I'm not alone
Love walks with me
Hallelujah in my heart
Salvation sweet awaits us
Beyond the shining light
A chance for you and me
To really do it right
And so it goes
You reap what you sow
My oats were wild and green
Now faith has found
Its way around
And does salvation bring
Chorus <start> Jack handed Rita his paycheck
With his apologies
He said They're cutting back at work
They had to let me go
And Jack expected tears he expected worse
But he didn't expect these words
As Rita pulled him close and she said to him
Don't worry about it baby let me tell you something
At the end of the day
Is really where it all begins
With who you love who loves you
And who's your friends
'Cause God don't care where you live
Who you are what you drive or how much you make
All that really counts is how you sleep
At the end of the day
Now Betty handed Bob the keys
To their million dollar home
Said Bob this might be living
But it sure ain't love
I thought I had to have all this I thought it made me 'Me'
Ah but now I think that it's just
Twenty cold rooms full of stuff
I need to say it let me tell you something else Bob
At the end of the day
Is really where it all begins
With who you love who loves you
And who's your friends
'Cause God don't care where you live
Who you are what you drive or how much you make
All that really counts is how you sleep
At the end of the day
Now when my grandpa died he didn't have a dime
But he was rich they say
And when it came time to see him off
The whole damn county came
And I remember he used to say it all the time
At the end of the day
Is really where it all begins
With who you love who loves you
And who's your friends
'Cause you know God don't care where you live
Who you are what you drive or how much you make
All that really counts is how you sleep
At the end of the day at the end of the day <start> It's taken me some time to read the writing on the wall
But I have finally figured out just what's been going on
And I need to tell you what I've learned before you turn to go
There's things about that other man I think you should know
The man that came between us was looking out for number one
He didn't care how bad he hurt you by the selfish things he'd done
But looking in the mirror today I finally came to see
That man that came between us was me
I know I'm sorry don't make up for half the tears you've cried
And I can't promise miracles but I swear to God I'll try
'Cause if you'll give me half a chance I'll love you like I should
Honey your lovin' man's come home again
And that stranger's gone for good
The man that came between us was looking out for number one
He didn't care how bad he hurt you by the selfish things he'd done
But looking in the mirror today I finally came to seed
That man that came between us was me
Oh honey the man that came between us was me <start> I fly away to heaven and I won't fall
When the angels carry me home
I want to see Jesus first of all
When the angels carry me home
When the angels carry me home
When the angels carry me home
I want to see Jesus first of all
When the angels carry me home
No more sorrow and no more pain
When the angels carry me home
I ride that heavenly glorious train
When the angels carry me home
When the angels carry me home
When the angels carry me home
I want to see Jesus first of all
When the angels carry me home
I walk Thy highway leading to heaven
When the angels carry me home
I see Jesus waiting for me in heaven
When the angels carry me home
When the angels carry me home
When the angels carry me home
I want to see Jesus first of all
When the angels carry me home <start> Troubled in mind I'm little blue
Bet you I won't be blue always
'Cause that ol' sun's gonna shine
On Jerry lee Lewis's back door step someday
I'm gonna lay my head
On somebody's lonesome railroad line
Let that ol' midnight special
Ease my troubled mind
Well they tell me that old graveyard
Is a mighty lonesome place
Lord they put you six feet under
Shovellin' mud directly in your face
Will goodbye baby may God bless you
And may He bless ol' killer a little bit too
Oh don't meet you over yonder baby
When they throw that Jerry right over you
Troubled in mind when I'm little blue
Bet you I won't be blue always
Cause the sun's gonna shine
On on my back doorstep
Some lowdown lonesome mother humpin' day <start> 
I was a rover on land and on sea
Till a good woman's love made a new man of me
Life had no meaning it was so incomplete
Till a good woman's love put me back on my feet
Stead of roamin' back home in the evenin' she's waiting there
And all that no matter what happens she'll always care
And when the night falls and the moon shines above
I'm a man with a dream and a good woman's love
Stead of roamin' back home <start> Hello heart well I'm glad you came a knockin'
Oh I can see that pretty little honey's got you back a rockin'
Well ain't you somethin' now you got me a jumpin'
Oh where you been Good to see you again hello heart
Well I know it's been a long time since the huggin' and a kissin'
And I'd nearly forgot just what we'd been a missin'
Now it's good to be together oh it never felt better
You gave me a scare I thought you were gone forever hello heart
You say you did a lotta hurtin' and you took a lotta achin'
But you never told me how close you came to breakin'
Now it's time for some healin' she knows how we're feelin'
Her lovin' is enough to give us both what we're needin'
Hello heart
Oh where you been
Good to see you again
Hello heart <start> Been waitin' all week

Now that you're here where you belong
I want to be the man you need
Just tell me you love me
Because I need to hear it too
Just let me be the one
You carry deep inside of you
I need you beside me
The road is so long
You run through my heart
Like the words of a bitter sweet song
I'll travel the whole world
Across the earth around the sun
If I could be the one
You carry deep inside of you
Without you beside me
The road is so long
You live in my heart
And it hurts when I think of you gone
I need you in my way
I have no right to love so true
But let me be the one
The one who lives deep inside of you
Just let me be the one
You carry deep inside of you <start> Come here girl I got a bottle of wine

Been a long day let your hair fall down
We can dance for a while
Lay around and be lazy

In your arms
Oh and then we start
We kiss like first time lovers
Tangled up in the covers

Oh and then we start
We kiss like first time lovers
Tangled up in the covers
Lets get it on
Love me all night make me miss ya all day long
All day long baby 
All day long  <start> How does a homing pigeon know his way back home alone to Ruth
A Ruth that he has never ever flown
Is it because his mate is waiting there that makes him beat his golden wings
Against the air until he's own
But he must go where his heart tells him there is nothing else that he can do
He's heard a call a comeback call the call that always brings me back to you
It's nature's way and the need is strong
It's the need to be in the place where you belong
What is the drive that drives a Simon on to spawn her eggs alone
The rivers and the streams where she was born
She fights the rapids and she scorn the rats and snakes that drag her down
And leave her graceful silver body torn
But she must go where her heart tells her there is nothing else that she can do
She's heard a call a comeback call the call that always brings me back to you
It's nature's way and the need is strong
It's the need to be in the place where you belong
Sometimes I say I'll stay away from you to see if I can break
The magic spell that binds me to your side
Then nighttime falls and something calls and like a swallow heading back
I must run onto your arms I'll fly
'Cause I must go where my heart tells me there is nothing else that I can do
I've heard a call a comeback call the call that always brings me back to you <start> I remember how the wood would smell
Just as the last great tree was felled
Like many that came before
It was used for table and a door
A palette and a long hall rack
Hung my great grandfather's hat
A stable and a barn a bed and a seat
A roof and fence and a floor that creaked
And a coffin leanin against the wall
When there was a death in Arkansas
I liked the wagons and the wheels
The wind that knocked us down in the fields
And the girls with the southern drawl
And those that came before were the pictures on the wall
And the lone dogs howled and the crows would caw
When there was a death in Arkansas
We were laid to rest out under the sun
And we breathed our last
And it was done
And the air redeemed us and we would learn
That a life was hallowed and we wouldn't burn
Hands folded gently to say goodbye
It was just this place underneath the sky
Do you see our bones hidin like a toad
In the old red dirt that is now a road
Beneath the sign that blinks off on
And a shopping mall where the house is gone
Forgetting that a soul may call
When there is a death in Arkansas
And a quilten patch of new concrete
Helps the trucks roll down the street
There's a Dollar Store by the setting sun
And a sign on the church says His Will is Done
I can't see the birds or find the fields
That hold my bones beneath the wheels
And a mother worries that her son won't call
And a tv stares at a blinking wall
But the lone dogs howl and the crows still call
When there is a death in Arkansas <start> Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested though in the wrong
Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
When we see Jesus coming in glory
When he comes from his home in the sky
Then we shall meet him in that bright mansion
We'll understand it all by and by
Farther along we'll know all about it <start> WHICH BRIDGE TO CROSS 
Writer Bill Anderson Vince Gill
RECORDED BY VINCE GILL
I've got two lovers in my life now A true love and one that's brand new I'm not really sure that I know how To love one and tell one we're through I can't sleep at night I toss and turn I keep losing sight of lessons I've learned I'm standing at the crossroads with just one concern Which bridge to cross and which bridge to burn I knew this was wrong I didn't listen Cause a heart only knows what feels right Oh I need to reach a decision And get on with the rest of my life I can't sleep at night I toss and turn I keep losing sight of lessons I've learned I'm standing at the crossroads with just one concern Which bridge to cross and which bridge to burn <start> Well tonight I'm gonna wear my dancin' shoes
'Cause I heard the word and I heard the news
There's a gal in town she's packin' 'em in
If you've seen her once you'll see her again
She's got a red hot dynamite band
They're burnin' down another onenight stand
Headlinin' double shows
Everybody go see Sally Rose
She sure knows how to rock the crowd
Rocks 'em slow rocks 'em loud
So you better move fast 'cause tickets are tight
If you want to see Sally Rose pick it tonight <start> 
Chorus
I'm the queen of the sleazy tabloids
I rule the trashy kingdom
Like Lady Di they make sure I am never left alone
Papparazzi and reporters stalk me from the shadows
Making sure to keep my royal assetts on my throne
Oh they talk about the lovers
That I keep undercover
And I wish that I was as much fun
As they have you believe
Just like Alec Baldwin
I'd love to whack 'em all one
But instead I'll wait and see
Who I am sleepin' with next week
I'm the queen of the sleazy tabloids
And I rule the trashy kingdom
But the rumors raise my cue score
And pay for my big home
I guess I 'augt to sue them
But instead I guess I'll use them
To keep me in the spotlight
And keep me on my throne
Cause I'm the queen of the sleazy tabloids <start> How can I convince you what you see is real
Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel
I was always reachin' you were just a girl I knew
I took for granted the friend I have in you
I was living for a dream
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever
The search is over
You were with me all the while
Can we last forever will we fall apart
At times it's so confusing these questions of the heart
You followed me through changes and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses through some miracle of fate
I was living for a dream
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever
The search is over
You were with me all the while
Now the miles stretch out behind me loves that I have lost
Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally stuck like lightning from the blue
Every highway leading me back to you
Now at last I hold you now all is said and done
The search has come full circle our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain the man I really am
I was living for a dream
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever
The search is over
You were with me all the while <start> Nibblin' on sponge cake
Watchin' the sun bake
All of those tourists covered in oil
Strummin' my sixstring
On my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp hey they're beginnin' to boil
Wasted away again in Margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's nobody's fault
I don't know the reason
I stayed here all season
Nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo
But it's a real beauty
A Mexican cutie
How it got here I haven't a clue
Wasted away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
Now I think
Must be Buffet's fault
I blew out my flipflop
Stepped on a poptop
Broke my leg twice I had to limp on back home
But there's booze in the blender
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on
Hang on
Wasted away again in Margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know this is all Alan's fault
Yes and some people claim that there's a woman to blame
And I know it's our own damn fault <start> WellHope is an anchor and love is a ship
time is the ocean and life is a trip
You don't know where you're goin' 'til you know where you're at
and if you can't read the stars well you better have a map
a compass and a conscience soul so you don't get lost at sea
Or on some old lonley island where no one wants to be
From the begining of creation I think our maker had a plan
for us to leave these shores and sail beyond the sand
and let the good light guide us through the waves and the wind
to the beaches in the world where we have never been
and we'll climb up on the mountain y'all and we'll let our voices ring
those who've never tried it they'll be the first to sing
oh my my
First Chorus
so i'll see you on the other side if I make it
it might be a long hard ride
but im gonna take it
sometimes it seems that i dont have a prayer
let the weather take me anywhere
but i know that i wanna go where the streets are gold
cause you'll be there
oh my my
Well you don't take nothing with you here
and you can't take nothing back
I ain't ever seen a hearse with a luggage rack
so i've torn my knees up praying scarred my back from falling down
I've spent so much time flying high til i'm face first in the ground
so if you're up there watching me would you talk to God and say
Tell him I might need a hand to see you both someday
oh my my
Second Chorus
So i'll see you on the other side if i make it
and it might be a long hard ride but i wanna take it
sometimes it seems that i don't have a prayer
let the weather take me anywhere
but i know that i wanna go where the streets are gold
'cause you'll be there
oh my my
cause you'll be there
oh my my <start> Sittin in the morning sun
Ill be sittin' when the evening come
Watching the ships roll in
And I'll watch 'em roll away again yeah
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away ouh
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wasting time.
I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco bay
I have nothing to live for
Look like nothings gonna come my way
So I'm just go sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wasting time
Look like nothings gonna change
Everything still remain the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same yes
Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone yes
Two thousand miles I roam
Just to make this dock my home
Now I'm just go sit at the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away ooh
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wasting time <start> Hand me down guitar handful of friends
Park in the dark where the road dead ends
With the trunk popped open and the music blowing out the JBLs
Just popping them tops yeah we were shooting off like a shotgun shell saying
Beer before liquor yeah you've never been sicker
Cops were pretty quick yeah but we were always quicker
Burning up the road 'til the tank ran dry
Just down home boys staying up all night
Fake ID worn out boots
And they can't tell me nothing kind of attitude
Got a styrofoam cup gonna fill it on up with a little bit of whiskey
Just talking that smack gonna take it out back who's coming with me
Beer before liquor yeah you've never been sicker
Find yourself a girl get her number maybe kiss her
Got a pack of Swishers anybody got a light
Just down home boys staying up all night
Whoa yeah whoa yeah
That four on the floor
Try to leave a little more than a mark on the blacktop
Got the world on the string
We were living like kings of a run down map dot
Beer before liquor yeah you've never been sicker
Cops were pretty quick yeah but we were always quicker
Burning up the road 'til the tank ran dry
Just down home boys staying up all night
Down home boys staying up all night
Whoa yeah whoa yeah
Staying up all night
Whoa yeah whoa <start> 
Well she's my Rose from the mountain where I come from
Back in ol' Colorado where they reach up and touch the sun
But I took her to the city where the air ain't clean
And it's wilted my Rose from the mountain

Where a good guitar picker makes more money than a cowboy
So I thought I'd try my luck makin' records in L.A.
But a lot of them bloys make a lot more music than I can
And if Rose don't like the city life I think I'll take her home
Well I can see her in the mornin' runnin' barefoot through the meadow
With a smile on her face and her hair ahangin' long
Well I love my sweet Rosey and oh she loves me
So I'm takin' her back home to the mountain

She's my Rose from the mountain where I come from
Back in ol' Colorado where they reach up and touch the sun
But I took her to the city where the air ain't clean
And it's wilted my Rose from the mountain
Yes it's wilted my Rose from the mountain <start> I was raised in the sticks
That's where I get my kicks
Tailgatin' with my buddies
Boots and dog and tires all muddy
Cold drinks chillin' in the creek
God's green earth for my seat
I Feel at home around a crowd of hicks
If you're on your feet before the sun comes up
And out there in your trucks
Makin' hay rain or shine
Break a sweat before daylight
The kind that ain't afraid of work
Elbow grease and good clean dirt
Taste your whiskey made from corn
But save your Sunday's for the Lord
It's a good chance you were born and
Raised in the sticks
That's where you get my kicks
Tailgatin' with their buddies
Boots and dog and tires all muddy
Cold drinks chillin' in the creek
God's green earth for your seat
You Feel at home around a crowd of hicks
That were raised in the sticks
How bout them girls in baseball caps
Ponytails pulled through the back
Tshirts tied up in a knot
Holy jeans and old flip flops
But they know some fishing holes
Sure cut down some old dirt roads
How to lock and load a gun
She shoots you straight believe me son
I'm so glad I found me one
Raised in the sticks
That's where they get my kicks
Tailgatin' with their buddies
Boots and dogs and tires all muddy
Cold drinks chillin' in the creek
God's green earth for their seat
They Feel at home around a crowd of hicks
That were raised in the sticks
Tailgatin' with their buddies
Boots and dogs and tires all muddy
Cold drinks chillin' in the creek
God's green earth for their seat
They feel at home around a crowd of hicks
That were raised in the sticks
Ya we're raised in the sticks <start>

I believe in Santa Claus <start> It's painted red the stripe was white
It was eighteen feet from the bow to the stern light
Second hand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
Put on a shine put on a motor
Built out of love made for the water
Ran her for years till the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten
It was just an old plywood boat
A ' Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it make me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make her whine
He'd say you can't beat the way an old wood boat rides
Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive
Just an old halfton shortbed Ford
My uncle bought new in '
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
Couple of burned valves and he had it going
He let me drive here when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
Sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal
It was just an old handmedown Ford
With threespeed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
And he'd say a little slower son you're doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive
I'm grown up now three daughters of my own
To let them drive my old Jeep across a pasture in our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say
Just an old wornout Jeep
Rusty old floorboard hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say turn it left and steer it right
Straighten up girl now you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
When Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive
Daddy let me drive
It's just an old plywood boat
With a ' Johnson with electric choke <start> My feet feel like two stones
I walk this road alone
Ain't got no way to know
Where I'm supposed to go
I lost my crystal ball
Found me a wrecking ball
I lost my crystal ball
It ain't hard to see
It's made a wreck of me
I tore the whole thing down
Watched it as it hit the ground
It didn't even make a sound
I wish I could turn it around
I lost my crystal ball
Found me a wrecking ball
I lost my crystal ball
It ain't hard to see
It's made a wreck of me
Oh fortune teller can't you tell me
A little bit of what I will be
Fortune teller what do you see
Lately nothing's coming easy
I lost my crystal ball
Found me a wrecking ball
I lost my crystal ball
It ain't hard to see
It's made a wreck of me <start> I've me skies of black and blue the way you make me feel
Give me skies of green and red cold winds that make it real
Storms are brewing deep within of hurt and loss and pride
It's good to see the world in pain when I take a walk outside
When it rains I don't mind being lonely I cry right along with the sky
When it rains I don't pretend to be happy I don't even have to try
When it rains Some people get down They're sporting a frown so I fit right in
Yeah the sun may brighten your day but if I had my way I'd take the rain
I don't care about politics or the hypocrites on my TV
I'm not mad at the girl who left because she couldn't be with me
So make up your theories about the scandals and the lies
Start out depressed then everything comes as a pleasant surprise
When it rains I don't mind being lonely I cry right along with the sky
When it rains I don't pretend to be happy I don't even have to try
When it rains Some people get down They're sporting a frown so I fit right in
Yeah the sun may brighten your day but if I had my way I'd take the rain <start> Don't be angry with me you darling
If I fail to understand
All your little whims and wishes all the time
Just remember I'm kind of dumb
I guess like any foolish girl
And my head stays sorta foggy 'cause you're mine
Now I recall the first time
That you flirted with me dear
And you jokingly said Come and be my bride
But now the time has turned the pages
Why it's the sweetest joke on earth
But I have you here forever by my side
And maybe someday you're gonna hurt me
Well I've been hurt in love before
Only God can know and time alone will tell
But in the mean time well I'll be loving you
With all my heart and soul
And pray God to let it last if it's his will
So don't be angry with me you darling
If I fail to understand
All your little whims and wishes all the time
Just remember I'm kind of dumb
I guess like any foolish girl
And my head stays sorta foggy 'cause you're mine
Yes my head stays sorta foggy 'cause you're mine <start> Cowboys and pioneers come lend your eyes and ears.
I've got the need to testify.
Don't try to fill your nest out in the open west
'cuz there's a million ways to die.
Six bullets in the gut or just a paper cut
...too many ways to quantify.
They'll cut your ankle off to cure a minor cough
'cuz there's a million ways to die.
Chorus
It's a hundred and one in the shade of the sun.
If you fall asleep you fry.
Chorus
You can live like a saint but there just really ain't
no avoiding a million ways to die.
Chorus
Smallpox and bigger pox and deadly tomahawks
...or God forbid you steal a pie.
They'll blast you into shards for bein' good at cards.
'cuz there's a million ways to die.
Out on the desert plains it hardly ever rains
and you can hear coyotes cry.
They'll eat you up and then they'll crap you out again
'cuz there's a million ways to die.
Chorus
With a whoosh and a whack there's a knife in your back
'cuz you got a fancy tie...
Chorus
It's a kick in the pants but you don't have a chance
of escaping a million ways to die.
Chorus <start> Chorus
Control yourself control yourself
If you wanna make him care for you oh
Control yourself control yourself
Though its gettin' mighty hard to do
I let him tell me all those lies
And then I look into his eyes
And then it begins I go in a spin
He's the boy that I dreamed about
And now that we are going out girl you'd better
Repeat Chorus
And when he's holding me so near
He whispers sweet things in my ear
And then it begins all over again
I just want him to hold me tight
Tell me that everything's alright girl you'd better
Repeat Chorus
Yeah its gettin' mighty hard to do
Getting mighty mighty hard to do
Yeah its gettin' mighty hard to do
Oh its gettin' mighty hard to do <start> Jump the Broom
Adrienne Young  Will Kimbrough
Join two hands this broom step over
take a sweet kiss from your own true lover
Diamond birthright Painted Flower
Seventeen years and sixteen hours
Out the window stares a girl
Kentucky wonder head full of curls
She aint my mama this aint my world
Too much swine for just one Pearl
Jump the broom jump the broom
Fly me away from this dark room
Cant go too far cant leave too soon
Love take my hand lets jump the broom
Broken bottle on the floor
Whiskey drippin down through the boards
Old man shoutin come back and fight
Young man run into the night
Was late ast summer down by the creek
Two young lovers fell warm and sweet
Kindred spirits kindred scars
Jordans Banks didnt seem so far
Jump the broom jump the broom
Fly me away from this dark room
Cant go too far cant leave too soon
Love take my hand lets jump the broom
New moon risin dark and still
Pearls a droppin from her windowsill
Tears burn and gather in brown eyes
Little sister waves goodbye
Now young Coreys waitin down by the gate
Cant call the preacher
Its much too late
But that dont stop his bended knee no no
Pretty Pearl girl marry me
Jump the broom jump the broom
Fly me away from this dark room
Cant go too far cant leave too soon
Love take my hand lets jump the broom <start> I wanna go home I wanna go home oh how I wanna go home
Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City
And I dreamed about those cotton fields and home
I dreamed about my mother dear old papa sister and brother
I dreamed about that girl who's been waiting for so long
I wanna go home I wanna go home oh how I wanna go home
Home folks think I'm big in Detroit City
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars by night I make the bars
If only they could read between the lines
Cause you know I rode the freight train north to Detroit City
And after all these years I find I've just been wastin' my time
So I just think I'll take my foolish pride
And put it on a Southbound freight and ride
And go on back to the loved ones the ones that I left waitin' so far behind
I wanna go home I wanna go home oh how I wanna go home <start> If all the world were as pretty as you
There'd be a million smiles for every tear or two
And love would grow where once hurt only grew
If all the world were as pretty as you
All the raindrops fall just to be where you are
And just to see your smile is the wish for every fallen star
If all the world were as pretty as you
There'd be no need to dream our dreams the way we do
For here on earth would be heaven come true
If all the world were as pretty as you
If all the world were as pretty as you <start> My windshields cracked just like my heart
My tires are all flat just like my brain
My engines running rough just like my soul
Don't know how much further we can go burning this much oil
So let's burn all the bridges ignore all the signs
Put the hammer down listen to her whine
I don't know where we went wrong
But its one step closer to you being gone
I gave you the tools but you broke every single rule
Every time I turn around I'm running back straight to you
Well I'm broken and twisted tired of dancing around
Pick me up throw me down pull me in throw me out again
So let's burn all the bridges ignore all the signs
Put the hammer down listen to her whine
I don't know where we went wrong
But its one step closer to you being gone
Tell me which way to go
'Cause if I'm going down
I want to be the first to know
So let's burn all the bridges ignore all the signs
Put the hammer down listen to her whine
I don't know where we went wrong
Yeah let's burn all the bridges ignore all the signs
Put the hammer down listen to her whine
I don't know where we went wrong
But its one step closer to you oh its one step closer to you
Oh its one step closer to you being gone
Bye bye bye bye my baby
Bye bye <start> Folks call me a maverick
Guess I ain't too diplomatic
I just never been the kind to go along
Just avoidin' confrontation
For the sake of conformation
And I'll admit I tend to sing a different song
But sometimes you just can't be afraid
To wear a different hat
If Columbus had complied
This old world might still be flat
Nothin' ventured nothin' gained
Sometimes you've got to go against the grain
Well I have been accused
Of makin' my own rules
There must be rebel blood
Just arunnin' through my veins
But I ain't no hypocrite
What you see is what you get
And that's the only way I know
To play the game
Old Noah took much ridicule
For building his great ark
But after forty days and forty nights
He was lookin' pretty smart
Sometimes it's best to brave the wind and rain
By havin' strength to go against the grain
Well there's more folks than a few
Who share my point of view
But they're worried
If they're gonna sink or swim
They'd like to buck the system
But the deck is tacked against 'em
And they're a little scared
To go out on a limb
But if you're gonna leave your mark
You can't follow like a bunch of sheep
You got to listen to your heart
Go bustin' in like old John Wayne
Sometimes you got to go against the grain
Nothin' ventured nothin' gained
Sometimes you've got to go against the grain <start> If it ain't one thing
I tell you it's always another
I wonder why
I started treating you like a stepbrother
Love is hard to explain
I know my loss is someone else's gain
Sometime's love is like a bitter pill
But we just have to take it like it is
Sometimes life is the sweetest thing
And sometimes it's just naked pain
Oh it's so hard to explain
I know my loss is someone else's gain
My troubles started when I found you
But that's when I  my world around you
And now my living ain't so easy
I thought that's what a woman was supposed to do
You see it's so hard to explain
I know my loss is someone else's gain
I went to see my doctor
cause I thought I had a hole in my heart
But he said 'girl you're just wasting my time
Because some man messed up
Went and messed up your mind'
It's so hard to explain
I know my loss is someone else's gain
Oh love it's so hard to explain
It'll make you forget your name
It'll turn you upside down
It'll make you wish that you'd never been found <start> Well I remember it all very well lookin' back
It was the summer that I turned eighteen.
We lived in a oneroom run down shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans.
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least we was hardpressed
When Momma spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress.
Well Momma washed and combed and curled my hair
Then she painted my eyes and lips.
Then I stepped into the satin dancin' dress.
It had a split in the side clean up to my hips.
It was red velvettrimmed and it fit me good
And standin' back from the lookin' glass
Was a woman
Where a half grown kid had stood.
She said Here's your last chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your last chance Fancy don't let me down.
Momma dabbed a little bit of perfume
On my neck and she kissed my cheek
Then I saw the tears welling up
In her troubled eyes as she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack and then
She looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death.
She handed me a heartshaped locket that said
To thine own self be true
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my highhealed shoe
It sounded like somebody else was talkin'
Askin' Momma what do I do
She said Just be nice to the gentlemen Fancy.
They'll be nice to you.
She said Here's your last chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your last chance Fancy don't let me down.
God forgive me for what I do
But if you want out girl it's up to you
Now don't let me down
Now get on out you better start sleepin' uptown.
That was the last time I saw my momma
When I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby.
Momma died and I ain't been back.
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no other way out.
It wasn't very long after that I knew exactly
What my momma was talkin' 'bout.
I knew what I had to do.
Then I made myself this solemn vow
I's gonna to be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how.
But I couldn't see spendin' the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame.
You know I mighta been born just plain white trash.
But Fancy was my name.
Here's your last chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down.
Wasn't long after that a benevolent man
Took me in off the streets
One week later I was pourin' his tea
In a five roomed penthouse suite.
Charmed a king a congressman
And an occasional aristocrat
And I got me an elegant Georgia mansion
And a New York townhouse flat.
Now I ain't done bad
Now in this world there's a lot of selfrighteous
Hypocrites who call me bad.
They criticize Momma for turning me out
No matter how little we had.
Though haven't had to worry 'bout nothin'
Now for nigh on fifteen years
But I can still hear the desperation
In my poor mommas voice ringin' in my ears.
Here's your last chance Fancy don't let me down
Oh here's your last chance Fancy don't let me down.
God forgive me for what I do
But if you want out well it's up to you.
Now your mama's helping you move uptown. <start> Standing on the promises of Christ my King
Through eternal ages let his praises ring
Glory in the highest I will shout and sing
Standing on the promises of God.
Refrain
Standing standing
Standing on the promises of God my Savior
Standing standing
I'm standing on the promises of God.
Standing on the promises I cannot fall
Listening every moment to the Spirit's call
Resting in my Savior as my all in all
Standing on the promises of God.
Refrain <start> In my hour of darkness in my time of need
Oh Lord grant me vision oh Lord grant me speed
Once I knew a young man went driving through the night
Miles and miles without a word but just his high beam lights
Who'd have ever thought they'd build such a deadly Denver bend
To be so strong to take so long as it would till the end
In my hour of darkness in my time of need
Oh Lord grant me vision oh Lord grant me speed
Another young man safely strummed his silver stringed guitar
And He played to people everywhere some say he was a star
But he was just a country boy his simple songs confess
And the music he had in him so very few possess
In my hour of darkness in my time of need
Oh Lord grant me vision oh Lord grant me speed
The there was an old man kind and wise with age
And he read me just like a book never missed a page
And loved him like a father and I loved him like my friend
And I knew his time could shortly come but I did not know just when
In my hour of darkness in my time of need
Oh Lord grant me vision oh Lord grant me speed
Oh Lord grant me vision oh Lord grant me speed <start> Did you ever wonder about the riddle
What kind of spirit lives in a fiddle
Well its old Satan right there a waiting
Or are you tuned with the angel band
Well you back up and push
Back up and push
Back up and push
Back off of sin and let Glory in
You cant go wrong singing this song
Back up and push away
Now back up and push.
If you let the devil play on your senses
Prepare to suffer the consequences
The foolish measure of the worldly pleasure
Can only drag you to the roaring fire <start> Take my hand for awhile explain it to me once again
Just for the sake of my broken heart
Look into my eyes and maybe I will understand
Our love I counted on was never there
You see I've thought that you might love me
So you caught me it seems off balance with the heart that's full
Of love and pretty dreams that two should share
And so I know but please before you go
Take my hand for awhile explain it to me once again
Just for the sake of my broken heart <start> She's the closest thing to happiness I found since losing you
My chance to live and love again just someone that I turn to
No I can't love her completely she knows what I'm going through
Cause she loves me the way that I love you
She's all the strenght I'll ever need to get me over you
She'll help me make you someone in the past that I once knew
She's beside me when I need her and these arms she'll never use
Cause she loves me the way that I love you
She wants me to want her the way that I want you
But now she's just someone to help me ease the hurt you put me through
No she won't erase your footprints but in time she'll fill your shoes
Cause she loves me the way that I love you
No she won't erase your footprints... <start> Down at the bottom of a well
I saw a flash
I never knew what it was
Now I know
The sun the stars the moon
And the way that you smile
When I open my front door
All along the road I look for a sign
To tell me if I'm going the right way
All along the road I look for a sign
To tell me if I'm going the right way
Now I know the rain all night
Leads to a clear blue sky
And the way that you smile
When I open my front door
Down at the bottom of a well
I saw a light
I never knew what it was
Now I know
The golden glow distant city arrives
And the way that you smile
When I open my front door
All along the road I look for a sign
To tell me if I'm going the right way
All along the road I look for a sign
To tell me if I'm going the right way
Now I know
One kind word
And the way that you smile
When I open my front door
One kind word
And the way that you smile
When I open my front door <start> Here's to the corners yet to turn
Here's to the bridges yet to burn
Here's to the whole thing blown apart
It's open season on my heart
Days go by like flying bricks
Leave gaping holes too deep to fix
I'd just stay home if I were smart
It's open season on my heart
I can't blame anyone but me
For this restless fool I've come to be
My tired excuses just don't fit
It don't look good from where I sit
I tried to change without much luck
I reach a point where I get stuck
I hit the streets and the fireworks start
It's open season on my heart
I can't be something that I'm not
I can't give you what I haven't got
I don't know where I'll while away
I only know the shape of you
Here's to the clown down in the mouth
Here's to the whole thing going south
Just stay home if I were smart
It's open season on my heart
I hit the streets and the fireworks start
It's open season on my heart <start> She gets the house and garden
He takes the boat and the car
Both their hearts have hardened
To the way things are
They're not quite sure what happened
Didn't see it slip away
There wasn't any big problem
They just forgot to pay attention
It happens all too often
Loves dies in vain
We drive the nails in the coffin
And just bury the blame
So many excuses
We'll say it's hard to explain
When the simple truth is
We just didn't pay attention
It's harder than it seems
So many things get in the way
But when you think of what you stand to lose
It not such a high price to pay
Attention
Just pay attention <start> Go little prayer go everywhere
Go to the hearts that are weary with care
Go little prayer go everywhere
Bring joy and happiness there
Shout from the steeple sing out from above
Pray that the morning will fill our hearts with love
Go through the night show us the light go go little prayer
 strings 
Go through the night show us the light go go little prayer
Go go little prayer <start> It was so right
It was so wrong
Almost at the same time
The pain and ache
A heart can take
No one really knows
But when the memories cling and take you there
Till you no longer care
You can let go now
It's not right for me
To cling to you
Somehow I just needed time
From what was to be
It's not like me
To hold somebody down
But I was tossed high by love
Almost never came down
Only to land
Where no love is found
And I'm no longer bound
I can let go now <start> They say you stand by your man
Tell me something I don't understand
You said you love me and that's a fact
And then you left me said you felt trapped
Well some things you can't explain away
But the heartache's with me to this day
Did you stand by me
No not at all
Did you stand by me
No way
All the times that we were close
I remember these things the most
I've seen my dreams come tumbling down
I can't be happy without you around
So alone I keep the wolves at bay
And there's only one thing I can say
Did you stand by me
No not at all
Did you stand by me
No way
So explain why this must be
Did you lie when you spoke to me
Did you stand by me
No not at all
Did you stand by me
No way
I got a job but it don't pay
I need new clothes
Somewhere to stay
Hey without these things I can do
But without your love
I can't make it through
But if you don't understand
My point of view
Then there's not a damn thing I can do
Did you stand by me
No not at all
Did you stand by me
No way <start> Somedays won't end ever and somedays pass on by
I'll be working here forever at least until I die
Dammed if you do dammed if you don't
I'm supposed to get a raise week you know damn well I won't
Workin' for a livin' 
Workin' for a livin' 
Workin' for a livin' livin' and workin'
I'm taking what they giving 'cause I'm working for a livin'
Hey I'm not complaining 'cause I really need the work
We're hitting up my buddy's got me feeling like a jerk
Car payment insurance alimony rent
I get a check on Friday but it's all ready spent
Workin' for a livin' 
I'm workin' for a livin' 
I'm workin' for a livin' livin' and workin'
I'm taking what they giving 'cause I'm working for a livin'.
Ahh workin' for a livin'
Ahh taking what they giving
Ahh workin' for a livin'
Ahh ahh
Bus boy bartender ladies of the night
Grease monkey exjunky winner of the fight
Walking on the streets its really all the same
Nascar rock star any other day
Workin' for a livin' 
I'm workin' for a livin' 
I'm workin' for a livin' livin' and workin'
I'm taking what they giving 'cause I'm working for a livin'.
Workin' for a livin' livin' and workin' <start> There's a long line of mourners driving down our little street
Their fancy cars are such a sight to see
They're all of your rich friends that knew you in the city
And now they finally brought you on to me
When you left you told me someday you'd be returnin'
In a fancy car for all the town to see
Now everybody's watching you finally got your dream
You're riding in a long black limousine
The papers told of how you lost your life
The party and the fatal crash that night
The race upon the highway the curve you didn't see
And now you're in that long black limousine
Through tear dimmed eyes I watch as you ride by
A chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine
I'll never love another my heart and all my dreams
Are with you in that long black limousine <start> 
My life is like unto a bargain store
And I may have just what you're lookin' for
If you don't mind the fact that all the merchandise is used
But with a little mending it could be as good as new
Why you take for instance this old broken heart
If you will just replace the missing parts
You would be surprised to find how good it really is
Take it and you never will be sorry that you did
The bargain store is open come inside
You can easily afford the price
Love is all you need to purchase all the merchandise
And I will guarantee you'll be completely satisfied
Take these old used memories from the past
And these broken dreams and plans that didn't last
I'll trade them for a future I can't use them anymore
I've wasted love but I still have some more
The bargain store is open come inside
You can easily afford the price
Love is all you need to purchase all the merchandise
And I can guarantee you'll be completely satisfied
My life is like unto a bargain store
And I may have just what you're lookin' for
If you don't mind the fact that all the merchandise is used
With a little mendin' it could be as good as new
The bargain store is open come inside
The bargain store is open come inside <start> He had such a short attention span
He was born with restlessness in his soul
She was well aware from the moment it began
This rollin stone would have to go
Who can blame him
If he's true to his hearts desire
Who can blame him
If he can't put out the fire
Who can blame him
If his feet were meant to run
If he likes the morning sun upon his back
Well you might as well blame the freight train
For loving the railroad track
She could see the sparkle disappear
As things came familiar to his eyes
She could sense time was drawin near
When you want it to stop
Its funny how time flies
Who can blame him
If he's true to his hearts desire
Who can blame him
If he can't put out the fire
Who can blame him
If his feet were meant to run
If he likes the morning sun upon his back
Well you might as well blame the freight train
For loving the railroad track
Now he'll keep her memory near his heart
But he'll keep his conscious clean
Cause he told no lies and she knew right from the start
He could never be tied to a Nine to Five routine
Now we all have our addictions
And wonder lust is one
Some cherish their restrictions
They stop and stare but he liked movin on
Who can blame him
If he's true to his hearts desire
Who can blame him
If he can't put out the fire
Who can blame him
If his feet were meant to run
If he likes the morning sun upon his back
Well you might as well blame the freight train
For loving the railroad track
Well you might as well blame the freight train
For loving the railroad track <start> She had good intentions and I had the same
She kept the baby and left me the blame
We both had our reasons but they weren't the same
Ain't it funny the way love can do ya
We made a promise we'd never break up our home
Or ever find reasons for leaving each other alone but we did
Once we were strangers then we were friends
Next we were lovers now we're strangers again
Ain't it funny the way love can do ya But it did
I had good intentions and she had the same
She kept the heartaches and left me the shame
We both have our memories but they're not the same
Ain't it funny the way love can do ya
We made a promise we'd never break up our home
Or ever find reasons for leaving each other alone but we did
Once we were strangers then we were friends
Next we were lovers now we're strangers again
Ain't it funny the way love can do ya But it did <start> Oh Lord my God when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made
Now I see the stars and I hear the rolling thunder
Thy art throughout the universe displayed
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art oh
How great Thou art
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art
When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation
To take me home what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall kneel in humble adoration and there proclaim my God
How great Thou art
Then sings my soul <start> Slowly I'm falling more in love with you
And slowly you're winning a heart that can be true
Now I can't hide my feelings no matter what I do
Slowly I'm falling more in love with you
More and more I need you and want you by my side
More and more I love you as each day passes by
No I can't hide my feelings no matter what I do
Slowly I'm falling more in love with you slowly
I'm falling more in love with you <start> Shame shame on you shame shame on you
Took my heart as a token when return it was broken
Hide your face shame on you
Shame shame on you shame shame on you
Took my car and my money tell you girl that ain't funny
Darn your hide shame on you
 steel 
Shame shame on you shame shame on you
Ran around with other guys and and try to lie when I got wise
Foolish girl shame on you

Hide your face shame on you

Shame shame on you shame shame on you
Can you hold your head up high look your friends right in the eyes
No you can't shame on you no no no shame on you <start>   boot cut with a skoal ring
Grease stains bleach spots and a hole in the knee
You say the man inside those Levi's don't take orders
And she'll just have to realize you'll do as you damn well please
You wear the pants buddy good for you
I'm so impressed yeah whooptydoo
You need to know that ain't how it works
It's not who wears the pants it's who wears the skirt
In the top drawer of her dresser there's some panties
Go try on that purple pair with the lacy frill
With your big old thighs I bet you can't get in 'em
And with that attitude of yours hell I bet you never will
You wear the pants buddy good for you
I'm so impressed yeah whooptydoo
You need to know that ain't how it works
It's not who wears the pants it's who wears the skirt
A big old boy like you can probably bench 
A little thing like her can barely lift the bar
But just wait until that woman has a headache
And she sits there with her legs crossed we'll see how strong you are
You wear the pants buddy good for you
We're so impressed whooptydoo
You'll soon find out that ain't how it works
It's not who wears the pants it's who wears the skirt
You wear the pants she'll wear the skirt <start> He sends her roses and lines he composes
Things a lady loves
Well he's there to hold her when she needs a shoulder
If life gets too rough
Oh now that she's left I keep kickin' myself
Whenever I start thinkin' back
He says he needs her tells her he loves her
Why didn't I think of that
When she gets down well he's always around and
He makes her smile again
He mends her heartaches remembers her birthday
And tries to be a friend
Now that she's gone I know ah I did her wrong
It's all so simple and fact
He says he wants her can't live without her
Why didn't I think of that
Ooooooh I've been watchin'
Every move he makes
Ooooooh I've been thinkin'
It could've been different somehow
If I'd known what I know now
He sings her love songs and tells her his love's strong
Things she needs to know
He tries to please her and calls for no reason
Just to say hello
He says he loves her and he'll never leave her
And I never will get her back
I did my best thought of everything else
Why didn't I think of that
Oooooooh I been watchin'
Every move that he makes
Oooooooh I been thinkin'
Oh it could've been different somehow
If I'd known what I know now
He sends her roses and lines he composes
Things a lady loves
He's there to hold her when she needs a shoulder
If life gets too rough
Oh now that she's left I keep kickin' myself
Whenever I start thinkin' back
He says he needs her tells her he loves her
Why didn't I think of that
He says he loves her and he'll never leave her
Why didn't I think of that <start> My heart will break as I watch you go but your kind of love is hard to hold
It seems you and I are losing touch so I'll wish you love and honey lots of luck
Well lots of luck and a big goodbye and you can't say I didn't try
It well could be that I tried too much
And that's why you're leaving but honey lots of luck
 guitar 
Now you want love and a big gold mine well that combination is hard to find
Cause money don't always walk with luck but you can go looking and honey lots of luck
Well lots of luck and a big goodbye...
Well honey lots of luck
Go on and leave now and baby lots of luck <start> How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I could do things my way
But little they know it's so hard to find one rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
Well once I was waiting in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for turned to start in life's game
Then suddenly it happened I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind
 steel 
Money won't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person's a proper at times compared to the man with a satisfied mind
When my life has ended my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave there's no doubt
But one thing for certain when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind
I'm gonna leave this old world with a satisfied mind <start> You see I'm always talkin'
When I should be drivin'
But everybody does it these days
You say I'm gettin' cancer
Every time I answer
Yeah whatever you say
Wish I could change my service
Should have never signed up
Heck it never works anyway
The signal's always breakin'
I can't hear nothin'
Hey what did you say
I know you can't hear me
There ain't no use in listenin'
I can't tell what you're sayin'
All I hear is hissin'
Yeah the more that I roam
The more I gotta pay
I'm on my cell phone
What the  did you say
I ought to get a beeper
It be a whole lot cheaper
Just throw this cell phone in the lake
I'd really love to call you
But even when I get through
It's always what did you say
Can anybody hear me
Or am I just wastin' minutes
I'm in 
 was my limit
Hey I gotta go
I can't hear you anyway
I'm on my cell phone
What the  did you say
Oh the more that I roam
The more I gotta pay
I'm on my cell phone
What the  did you say <start> Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored
He had loosed the fateful lightening of his terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on.
Glory glory hallelujah
Glory glory hallelujah
Glory glory hallelujah
His truth is marching on.
In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea
With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me
As he died to make men holy let us die to make men free
While God is marching on.
Glory glory hallelujah
Glory glory hallelujah
Glory glory hallelujah
While God is marching on.
Glory glory hallelujah
Glory glory hallelujah
Glory glory hallelujah
While God is marching on.
His truth is marching on... <start> Last night I had a blue dream cause in my dream you told me we were through
I cried cause in my blue dream I saw you away with someone new
And then beside the blue stream I saw him makin' a fairy love to you
Last night it was just a blue dream
But tonight I'm blue because my blue dream came true
 guitar 
And then beside the blue stream... <start> I've had nothing but sorrow
Since you said we were through
There's no hope for tomorrow
How's the world treating you
Every sweet thing that matters
Has been broken in two
All my dreams have been shattered
How's the world treating you
Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day you're away
Though our pathways have parted
To your memory I'm true
Guess I'll stay brokenhearted
How's the world treating you
Do you wonder about me
Like I'm hoping you do
Are you lonesome without me
Have you found someone new
Are you burning and yearning
Do you ever get blue
Do you think of returning
How's the world treating you <start> well sadie momma told her your nearly

As I pulled out of the drive
The woman right there staring back at me
I could hardly recognise
She looked so strong and selfassured
in a way I never was
until I met you
until you loved me.
There were places I thought I would never go
things I'd never do.
The skies the limit now
and that's all because of you.
Thank god I stopped believing in the walls I lived behind
I was blind
Until you loved me...
Chorus
I didn't know I could glow like this
I never know what love is
Until I saw myself in a picture beside you
Your steady arms around me
In your eyes I can see
You make me
The woman I wanna be
I could drive right down a lonely road
Straight into the dark
Cause you're my destination
Baby you're my place to start
My Fear and limitations are all I leave behind
That suits me fine...
It's about time.
Chorus
I didn't know I could glow like this
I never know what love is
Until I saw myself in a picture beside you
Your steady arms around me
In your eyes I can see
You make me
The woman I wanna be
I didn't know I could fly so high
Now I wanna be up there with you all of the time
Cause you make me who I am
Yeah till you loved me
Your steady arms around me
In your eyes I can see
You make me
Oh baby you make me
The woman I wanna be.
Yeahyeah <start> I am weak but Thou art strong Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long as I walk dear Lord close to Thee
Just a closer walk with Thee grant it Jesus is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee let it be dear Lord let it be
When my feeble life is o'er time for me will be no more
Guide me gently safely o'er to Thy kingdom shores to Thy shores
Just a closer walk with Thee <start> If you've never felt what happens
When two hearts thaw together
Or never seen love written in the stars
And knew it was forever
If you don't believe that destiny
Can start with just one wish
Watch this
I'll show you love like you've dreamed of
I've got so much to give
Watch this
Don't be afraid you'll be amazed
At all the ways that I can
Show you what you've missed
Just close your eyes
And watch this
A broken heart can always live in fear
Afraid to fall
I can make those feelings disappear
In no time at all
If you wanna feel the world stand still
From the magic of one kiss
Watch this
I'll show you love like you've dreamed of
I've got so much to give
Watch this
Don't be afraid you'll be amazed
At all the ways that I can
Show you what you've missed
Just close your eyes
And watch this
Watch this
I'll show you love like you've dreamed of
I've got so much to give
Watch this
Don't be afraid you'll be amazed
At all the ways that I can
Show you what you've missed
Just close your eyes
And watch this
Oh baby watch this <start> Well I got my quarters for the jukebox and your memories on my mind
There aint no doubt that the fires all out Because Im the only one sittin here crying
Barmaid wont you set me up with a round before you walk by
Let me hear that jukebox playin Im so Lonesome I Could Cry
Well this time she really did it like a hundred times before
I never thought her words were true I heard the slamming of our door
So I intend to sit right here at least till I cant think
Its a lot better than sittin at home while Im slowing going insane
Chorus
Well I guess she went and did it well she pulled that plug on me
So I intend to knock em back hey at least till I cant see
So bartender dont forget about me when you walk by
And dont you pay attention to these tear drops in my eyes
Chorus
Said let me here that jukebox playin Im so Lonesome
Im goin outta my mind <start> I hear songs on the radio
They might be fast or they might be slow
But every song they play's got me thinkin' 'bout you
I see a fella walkin' down the street
He looks at me and he smiles real sweet
But he don't matter to me
'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Every little dream I dream about you
Every little thought I think about you
Drives me crazy when you go away
I oughta keep you locked up at home
And like a wild horse I want to break you
I love you so much I hate you
Every little thing reminds me of you
Honey when you leave me here all alone
My tongue gets tied when I try to talk
My knees get weak when I start to walk
So I might as well stay home and keep thinkin' 'bout you
the young and the restless on my tv set
That's just like us when we first met
And when they start to kissin'
Got me thinking bout you
Every little dream I dream about you
Every little thought I think about you
Drives me crazy when you go away
I oughta keep you locked up at home
And like a wild horse I want to break you
I love you so much I hate you
Every little thing reminds me of you
Honey when you leave me here all alone <start> I was born in Saginaw Michigan I grew up in a house on Saginaw bay
My daddy was a poor hard working Saginaw fisherman
Too many nights he came home with too little pay
I loved a girl in Saginaw Michigan the daughter of a wealthy wealthy man
But he called me that son of a Saginaw fisherman
And he said I wadn't good enough to claim his daughter's hand
That's why I'm up here in Alaska lookin' around for gold
Like a crazy fool I'm diggin' in the frozen ground so cold
But with each new day I pray I'll strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw Michigan
 ac.guitar 
I wrote my love in Saginaw Michigan I said honey I'm comin' home please wait for me
You can tell your dad I'm coming back a richer man
I've hit the biggest strike in Klondyke history
Her daddy met the bus in Saginaw Michigan
He gave me a great big party and we drank champagne
Then he said son you're a wise young ambitious man
Don'tcha wanna sell your fatherinlaw your Klondyke claim
And now he's up there in Alaska diggin' in the cold cold ground
The greedy fool is a lookin' for the gold I never found
It serves him right and no one here is missing him
Least of all the newly weds of Saginaw Michigan
We're the happiest man and wife in Saginaw Michigan
And he's ashamed to show his face in Saginaw Michigan <start> Met a little senorita named Margarita down in Mexico
She taught me more about love in a day or two than I'll ever know
I had to go back across the Rio Grande
And leave that little girl behind
I can't believe how heavy she's laying on my mind
Oh tonight I need a Margarita and I need it bad
I'm hoping that the tequila is gonna take me back
Give me the salt and the lime
So I can taste her and hold her one last time
Oh tonight I need a Margarita and I need her bad
Those eyes and that smile they drove me while I just couldn't resist
I couldn't get enough from our first touch to our last kiss
I never understood a single word she said
Oh but she left no doubt
When she spoke to me in the language of love
She turned my world inside out
Oh tonight I need a Margarita and I need it bad
I'm hoping that the tequila is gonna take me back
Give me the salt and the lime
So I can taste her and hold her one last time
Oh tonight I need a Margarita and I need her bad <start> a single red rose and a table for two
a nice chardonnay and an ocean view
ships comin in stars comin' out
we sat and we talked 'til the place closed down
then we took a long walk down on the beach
her in that white dress in her bare feet
we stopped and we watched the lighthouse light
i pulled her close and i held on tight
and i said
to myself
it doesn't get better than this
no it doesn't get better than this
and it did
it did
oh it did
fast forward to that next spring
we were lookin for a preacher pickin out rings
family comin in and friends comin out
to that little white church on the outskirts of town
me and that tux fightin butterflies
tears of joy in my mama's eyes
her daddy walkin her down that aisle
i lifted that veil and i saw that smile
and i said
to her
it doesn't get better than this
no it doesn't get better than this
and it did
it did
oh it did
just when i start thinkin it's as good as it can get
this crazy life does somethin
just to let me know
i haven't seen anything yet
nine months later nearly to the day
there we were flyin down the interstate
car weavin in and car weavin out
through traffic runnin every red light in town
delivery room and the doctor comes in
i'm right beside her she's squeezin my hand
one more push and a baby cries
a sweet little angel with her mama's eyes
and i said
to my girls
it doesn't get better than this
no it doesn't get better than this
and it did
it did
oh it did
yes it did
a single red rose and a table for two
a nice chardonnay and an ocean view <start> Chorus
Christmas time's a comin'
Christmas time's a comin'
Christmas time's a comin'
And I know I'm goin' home
Snow flake's afallin'
My old heart's a callin'
Tall pine's a hummin'
Christmas Time's a comin'
Can't you hear them bells ringin' ringin'
Joy don'tcha hear them singin'
When it's snowin' I'll be goin'
Back to my country home
Chorus
White candle's burnin'
My old heart's a yearnin'
For the folks at home when
Christmas time's a comin'
Can't you hear them bells ringin' ringin'
Joy don'tcha hear them singin'
When it's snowin' I'll be goin'
Back to my country home
Chorus
Holly's in the window
Home where the wind blows
The cane foam's a runnin'
Christmas time's a comin'
Can't you hear them bells ringin' ringin'
Joy don'tcha hear them singin'
When it's snowin' I'll be goin'
Back to my country home
Chorus x <start> Well she seemed alright by dawn's early light
Though she looked a little worried and weak
She tried to pretend he wasn't drinkin' again
But daddy left the proof on her cheek
And I was only eight years old that summer
And I always seemed to be in the way
So I took myself down to the fair in town
On Independence Day
Well word gets around in a small small town
They said he was a dangerous man
But mama was proud and she stood her ground
She knew she was on the losin' end
Some folks whispered some folks talked
But everybody looked the other way
And when time ran out there was no one about
On Independence Day
Let freedom ring
Let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know
That today is a day of reckoning
Let the weak be strong
Let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away let the guilty pay
On Independence Day
Well she lit up the sky the fourth of July
By the time that the firemen came
They just put out the flames and took down some names
And sent me to the county home
Now I ain't sayin' it's right or it's wrong
But maybe it's the only way
Talk about your revolution
It's Independence Day <start> I watch the sky that brightens with the dawn
And I know this night with you is almost gone
And I memorize each moment of the special thing that's been
Just in case a night like this one never comes again
A daylight call the rest I struggle through it's changed into a magic time with you
Why once again my hands and eyes take your beauty in
Just in case a night like this one never comes again
It's true we talk of future things to be but beyond this dawn's too far for me to see
So hold me now and love me before the night time ends
Just in case a night like this one never comes again
Just in case a night like this one never comes again <start> Ten thousand words swarm around my head
Ten million more in books written beneath my bed
I wrote or read them all when searchin' in the swarms
Still can't find out how to hold my hands
And I know you need me in the next room over
But I am stuck in here all paralyzed
For months I got myself in ruts
Too much time spent in mirrors framed in yellow walls
Ain't it like most people I'm no different
We love to talk on things we don't know about
Ain't it like most people I'm no different
We love to talk on things we don't know about
And everyone around me shakes their head in disbelief
And says I'm too caught up
They say young is good and old is fine
And truth is cool but all that matters
Is that you have your good times
But their good times come with prices
And I can't believe it when I hear the jokes they make
At anyone's expense except their own
Would they laugh if they knew who paid
Ain't it like most people I'm no different
We love to talk on things we don't know about
Ain't it like most people I'm no different
We love to talk on things we don't know about
And after we are through ten years
Of making it to be the most of glorious debuts
I'll come back home without my things
'Cause the clothes I wore out there
I will not wear 'round you
And they'll be quick to point out our shortcomings
And how the experts all have had their doubts
Ain't it like most people I'm no different
We love to talk on things we don't know about
Ain't it like most people I'm no different
We love to talk on things we don't know about
Ain't it like most people I'm no different
We love to talk on things we don't know about
Ain't it like most people I'm no different
We love to talk on things we don't know about <start> Fooled by a feeling I was fooled
I followed my heart right into your arms
Like you wanted me to
Fooled by a feeling lying with you
I thought it was love but it was only a touch
And when you left me I knew
I was fooled by a feeling
Now I'm feeling like a fool
You whispered I love you
All through the night
You made love so easy to believe
Your touch was so gentle
The feeling was right
But I was wrong for believing you loved me
I was fooled by a feeling I was fooled
I followed my heart right into your arms
Like you wanted me to
Fooled by a feeling lying with you
I thought it was love but it was only a touch
And when you left me I knew
I was fooled by a feeling
Now I'm feeling like a fool
Fooled by a feeling I was fooled
I followed my heart right into your arms
Like you wanted me to
Fooled by a feeling lying with you
I thought it was love but it was only a touch
And when you left me I knew
I was fooled by a feeling
Now I'm feeling like a fool
Fooled by a feeling
Now I'm feeling like a fool
By a feeling I was fooled
I followed my heart right into your arms
Like you wanted me to <start> Oh where is my sailor boy
Where is my sailor boy
He sleeps at the bottom of the deep blue sea
And he can't come back to me
I stand on the beach alone
And gaze at the misty blue
Deep sea as you hold him to your breast
Does he mention my name to you
Oh what does the deep sea say
What does the deep sea say
It moans it groans it splashes and it foams
And it rolls on its weary way
Oh please tell me deep blue sea
Is he sleeping peacefully
The winds from the north are blowin' icy cold
Can you keep him warm for me
If only my grieving soul
Some token of love could find
And if only the waves would show me where he sleeps
Then I'd leave this world behind
Oh what does the deep sea say
What does the deep sea say
It moans it groans it splashes and it foams
And it rolls on its weary way
A beautiful rose one day
I placed on the crest of a wave
I said Take it please and let it settle home
Above his watery grave
The driftwood I watched in vain
And my rose never came back again
Oh waves take another message to my love
Sayin' I'll need him alone
Oh what does the deep sea say
What does the deep sea say
It moans it groans it splashes and it foams
And it rolls on its weary way <start> All my traveling time
Running circles around my dreams
Waking up to find
Our love's not what it seems
Now my soul keeps calling for a long lost day
And a love that I held so true
Well there's no use following the heartache
That leads me back to you I'll
Chorus
Wait for the way
Through the valley of my shadow of doubt
Through the winter of my discontent
And when it seems like all my hope is spent
There's only one prayer I pray...wait for the way
Each small step of my life
There's a loneliness I've known
I take the road that's right
Even if I'm left alone
But I know that heaven holds amazing grace
When you trust what you feel inside
And a true heart opens at it's own pace
And I must say goodbye and
Chorus
Now my soul keeps calling for a long lost day
And a love that I held so true
Though there's no use falling for the heartache
That leads me back to you I'll
Chorus <start> 'Bout ten years old hide and seek
I found me in the closet
Ready or not I stumbled on
And opened up that box of
Yearbooks letters black and whites
A hundred maybe more
Next thing I know my brothers and me
Got 'em scattered on the floor 
There was one of her flippin' the bird
Sittin' on a Harley
And a few with some hairy hippie dude
Turns out his name was Charlie
Her hair her clothes her drinkin' smokin'
Had us boys confused
I'll never forget the day us nosy kids got introduced...
To mama 'fore she was mama
In a string bikini in Tijuana
Won't admit she smoked marijuana
But I saw mama 'fore she was mama
We put that box right where it was
And never said a word
But growin' up got hard just tryin'
Not to picture her
In anything but aprons dresses
Minivans and church
Oh and Daddy would have whooped our butts
For diggin' up that dirt...
On mama 'fore she was mama
In a string bikini in Tijuana
She won't admit she smoked marijuana
But I saw mama 'fore she was mama
We laugh and hang it over her head
Right above her halo
Her face turns red when we bring up
That tiedyed Winnebago
She runs and hides and still denies
That hiphigh rose tattoo
She burned that box of forgetmenots
When she found out we knew...
About mama 'fore she was mama
In a string bikini in Tijuana
Won't admit she smoked marijuana
But that was mama 'fore she was mama
And there's that one down in the Bahamas
But that was mama 'fore she was mama <start> For sale and a number on a sign at the end of the drive.
Plastic toys and a swingset all tangled up in grass that's grown knee high.
I walked up on the front porch of the house where our love made its last stand.
Chorus
There's a thousand memories that are now in real estate hands.
I stood there on the welcome mat and discovered they forgot to lock the door.
I was glad that it was open cause my old key don't fit here anymore.
On the wall of the living room I saw markings and a crayon drawn stick man.
Chorus
There's a thousand memories that are now in real estate hands.
How can you put a price on someone's piece of life I'd like to know.
Something so precious can't be bought or sold. Like that corner of
the bedroom where we made love and plans.
Chorus
There's a thousand memories that are now in real estate hands.

Something so precious can't be bought or sold. Like that corner of

There's a thousand memories that are now in real estate hands.
There's a thousand memories that are now in real estate hands. <start> Previously unreleased song . Lay It Down outtake
Transcribed by T.V.Roosmalen
What does he see in those mashed potatoes
What secrets does he hold that can be so grin
The silence like a canyon dividing them
He's on one side she's opposite him
Trying so desperately to get his attention
she says honey you're a bastard of great proportion.
He says darling I plead guilty to that sin.
With potatoes half way to his mouth
He looks her in the eye and says
without a doubt
My love for you is all that I believe in.
With those few simple words
Her heart is sent soaring
She's able to face another day
. through the anger and the laughter
She knows that she matters
And somebody out there cares.
What does she gain by all this sulking
What trouble can there be for one so young
Dark tension building like the clouds of a storm
Her daughter's in her room and she's at the door
Trying to figure what all this fuss is for.
she says mother you're a witch
And I'll always hate you.
She says daughter perhaps these words
You speak are true.
She quietly moves towards the bed
Look her in the eye gently says
but I will always believe in you.
With those few simple words
Her heart is sent soaring
She's able to face another day.
Through the anger and the laughter
She knows that she matters
And somebody out there cares.
what do we need to keep us going
What do we need at the end of the day
Mysteries keep piling like dirty clothes
In the corner.
You never thought you'd give up.
But you're beginning to wonder
When through the gloom you hear
A familiar voice say....
.... a few simple words
That send your heart soaring
You're able to face another day.
Through the anger and the laughter
You know that you matter
And somebody out there cares. <start> Haven't seen the sun for seven days
November's got her nails dug in deep
Haven't seen my son for seven years
And the chances are we'll never again meet
If truth be told I don't even know his name
If truth be told he doesn't even know my name
I spend my spare time with my rosary beads
Although I never learnt to pray
But you don't need the light
And it's best to pretend
That you've seen the errors of your ways
The darkness in here
Is as heavy as a judgment
This darkness heavy as a judgment
My dreams are now filled with Gilead trees
And other sights that I've never seen
They used to be filled
With the fears of tomorrow
And the horror that it might bring
His eyes felt to me
As cold as a stone mason's chisel
His eyes fell on me cold
Like a stone mason's chisel
Strange how a mind can always recall
What the senses eagerly leave behind
I can remember his face rage
Disgust and distaste
But to my fear I have grown blind
Memories are just dead men making trouble
This memory is just a dead man making trouble <start> Didn't work out did it
You'll have to admit it
It wasn't so easy was it
Didn't work out did it
You thought love had made me blind
You could do just as you please
But just like a great big ol' neon sign
I could see you were cheatin' on me
Didn't work out did it
You'll have to admit it
It wasn't so easy was it
Didn't work out did it
Didn't work out did it
You'll have to admit it
It wasn't so easy was it
Didn't work out did it
So go on and do what you want to
This time I'm ready for anything
Well I don't care much what you do
I'm gonna go on and laugh and sing
Didn't work out did it
You'll have to admit it
It wasn't so easy was it
It didn't work out did it <start> All my friends are asking me where I plan to spend the holidays
People seem to celebrate the season in so many different ways
Some go where the weather's freezing cold while others like it warm
I don't care about the weather just whether I spend Christmas in your arms
Chorus
We could drive up to the mountains build a fire and watch it snow
We could sail down to the islands where the gentle breezes blow
I'd be happy in the city I'd be happy on the farm
I don't care where I spend Christmas as long as I spend Christmas in your arms
It was only last December I had no Christmas spirit in my heart
My world lay cold and shattered in the ashes of a dream that fell apart
But now you're here beside me no greater gift is wrapped beneath my tree
And the arms you wrap around me and the precious gift of love you give to me
Chorus <start> 
I've made up my mind
To live in memory of the lonesome times

It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday

Those happy hours that we once knew
Tho' long ago they still make me blue
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we 've been apart

I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times

It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday

Those happy hours

That we once knew

Tho'' long ago

Still maaaake me blue

They say that time

Heals a broken heart

Time has stood still

Since we've been apart

I said I made up my mind
To live in memory of the lonesome times


It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life of dreams of yesterday
 <start> Mary did you know that your baby boy will some day walk on water
Mary did you know that your baby boy will save our sons and daughters
Did you know that your baby boy has come to make you new
This child that you've delivered will soon deliver you.
Mary did you know that your baby boy will give sight to a blind man
Mary did you know that your baby boy will calm a storm with his hand
Did you know that your baby boy has walked where angels trod
And when your kiss your little baby you have kissed the face of God.
Oh Mary did you know
The blind will see the deaf will hear the dead will live again.
The lame will leap the dumb will speak the praises of the lamb <start> Well the rain is a drippin' from the trees
Just like the tears a fallin' from my cheeks
And the lonesome train's movin' down the track
Just like her it ain't comin' back
She left me here without any warning
On a cold gray Kentucky morning
I need a cup of coffee with a shot of cream
Wake me from this awful dream
When I went to sleep she was by my side
And I didn't know she wasn't satisfied
Well she left me here without any warning
On a cold gray Kentucky morning
And all the time she never said a word
I guess I should have known from what I never heard
Now I'm waking up without my darling
On a cold cold gray Kentucky morning
Now the Ohio is wide and deep
And I'm walking beside it in my sleep
And I'm thinking about drowning my sorrow
'Cause I don't want to have to face tomorrow
She left me here without any warning
On a cold gray Kentucky morning <start> How do I
Break it to my heart
That it's gotta get over you
How do I
Learn to live apart
From the one I gave my life to
Well right here
Right now
Better turn me inside out
So I can just move on
Bring on the pain
Let it kill your memory
Bring on the rain
Let it drown what's left of you and me
I know the only way I'm ever gonna make it
Is burying the best of us though it's killing me
'Cause I don't love you any less
But I can't love you anymore
How will I
Learn to trust again
If I can't forgive
How will I
Let a new love in
If I'm still holding on to
all these angry tears
And those wasted years
The only way I'll ever let them go
So bring on the pain
Let it kill your memory
Bring on the rain
Let it drown what's left of you and me
I know the only way I'm ever gonna make it
Is burying the best of us though it's killing me
'Cause I don't love you any less
But I can't love you anymore
So bring on the pain
Let it kill your memory
Bring on the rain
Let it drown what's left of you and me
I know the only way I'm ever gonna make it
Is burying the best of us though it's killing me
'Cause I don't love you any less
No I don't love you any less
But I can't love you anymore <start> Have you heard the many a story
Told by old and young with joy
'Bout the many deeds of daring
That was done by the Johnson boys
That was done by the Johnson boys
That was done by the Johnson boys
That was done by the Johnson boys
The Johnson boys were boys of honor
They knew how to court the maids
They knew how to hug and kiss them
Oh but pretty girls don't be afraid
Oh but pretty girls don't be afraid
Oh but pretty girls don't be afraid
Oh but pretty girls don't be afraid
They were lads of skill and courage
And their sights were very far
And they joined the country service
In that awful civil war in that awful civil war
In that awful civil war in that awful civil war
They were scouts in Rebels army
And were known far and wide
When the Yankees saw them comin'
They throw down their guns and hide
They throw down their guns and hide
They throw down their guns and hide
They throw down their guns and hide <start> And I'd like to take you take you away
And if you'd come with me we'd leave here today
There's nothing to hold you as strong as this feeling
And I've got to have you as soon as I can
And I know you're worried about where you stand
The ring that he gave you is still on your hand
You want to be faithful you want to believe
He's easy to lie to but hard to deceive
And you say it's over between you and him
He tells you he needs you but chances are slim
That he even wants you as much as I do
So why don't you go on and tell him you're through
Cause I'd like to take you
And I'd like to take you
And I've got to have you as soon as I can as soon as I can <start> He was just and old country doctor in a small Georgia town
Fame and fortune had passed him by but we never saw him frown
As day by day in his kindly way he served us one and all
Many a patient forgot to pay although Doc's fees were small
But ol' Doc Brown didn't seem to mind in fact he didn't even send out bills
His only ambition it seemed was to find sure cures for aches and ills
Why nearly half the folks in our home town
And yes I'm one of them too were ushered in by ol' Doc Brown
When we made our first debaut ah he needed his dimes
And there were times he'd receive a fee
But he would pass it on to some poor soul that he said needed it worse than he
So when hard times hit our town and drained each meager purse
The scanty income of Ol' Doc Brown just went from bad to worse
He had to sell his furniture why he couldn't even pay his office rent
And so to an old dusty room over a liberty stable Ol' Doc Brown and his satchel went
On the hitching post at the curb below to advertise his wares
He nailed up a little sign that read Doc Brown has moved up stairs
And there he kept on helping people get well and his heart was pure gold
But anyone with eyes could see that Doc was getting old
Then one day he didn't even answer when they knocked upon his door
Ol' Doc Brown was lying down but his life was no more
They found him there in his old black suit but on his face was a smile of contentment
But all the money they could find on him was a quarter and one ol' copper cent
So they opened up his ledger and what they saw gave their hearts a pull
cause beside each debtor's name Ol' Doc had written Paid in full
Well it looked like the potter's field for Doc and that caused us some alarm
'Till some one remembered the family graveyard out on the Simmon's farm
Ol' Doc had brought six of their kids into this world and Simmons was a grateful cuss
He said Doc been like one of the family so he can sleep with us.
Ol' Doc Brown should have had a funeral fine enough for a king
It's a ghastly joke that our town was broke and no one could give a thing
Except Jones the undertaker he did mighty well
He donated an old iron casket he'd never been able to sell
And the funeral procession well it wasn't much for grace and pomp and style
But those wagonloads of mourners they stretched out for more than a mile
And we breathed a prayer as we laid him there to rest beneath the sod
This man who had earned the right to be on speaking terms with God
His grave was covered with flowers but not from the floral shop
Just roses and things from folks gardens and one or two dandelion tops
For times had hit our town hard and each man carried a load
So some just picked the wild flowers as they passed along the way
We wanted to give Doc a monument we kind of figured we owed him one
cause he had made our town a better place for all the good he had done
But monuments cost money so we just did the best we could
And on his grave we just placed a monument of wood
We pulled up that old hitching post where Doc had nailed his sign
We painted it white and to all of us it surely did look fine
Now the rains and snow has washed away our white trimmings of paint
And there ain't nothing left but Doc's old sign and even that's getting faint
And still when southern breezes and twinkling stars cross our little town
And pail moonlight shines through Georgia pines on the grave of Ol' Doc Brown
You can still see that old hitching post as if in answer to our prayers
Proudly telling the whole wide world Doc Brown has moved up stairs <start> I wandered today to the hills Maggie
To watch the scene below
The creek and the creaking old mill Maggie
As we used to long long ago
The green grove is gone from the hills Maggie
Where first the daisies sprung
The creaking old mill is still Maggie
Since you and I were young
Oh they say that I'm feeble with age Maggie
My steps are much slower than then
My face is a wellwritten page Maggie
And time all alone was the pen
They say we have outlived our time Maggie
As dated as songs that we've sung
But to me you're as fair as you were Maggie
When you and I were young <start> Well I parked my car in the driveway
Somewhere around  am
Worn out from the road with a big heavy load
On my mind what a week it had been
Then I stumbled into the kitchen
And I saw that little red light
Blinkin' at me from my message machine
Then I knew it would be alright
'Cause she said
Baby come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Now it didn't take me a second 'til I knew
The right thing to do
I picked up the phone and said Baby I'm home
I'll be there in a minute or two.
I stole some of my neighbor's daisies
Grabbed an old bottle of wine
She don't call me much but I know when she does
That I'm in for one helluva time
When she says
Baby come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby baby baby just for tonight
Be my one and only
Baby come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Yeah everybody needs a little love sometimes
Yeah who am I to leave you hangin' high and dry
No baby not tonight
Nononono
Not tonight now baby
Baby come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby baby just come hold me tight
You don't have to call me
Baby baby baby come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
I'm lonely lonely lonely
So come on baby
Said I'll be there in a minute or two.
And I brought those daises and that red wine
We had one hell of a time
Yeah yeah yeah <start> Me and Jimmie Rodgers used to ride them rollin' boxcars in the summer time
Jimmie he'd play his guitar I'd lay back and watch the stars and sip my wine
Me and Audie Murphy used to crawl out on our bellies through the German lines
Audie I won't leave you here I'll pull you through cause buddy you're a pal of mine
Me and Phil Rizzuto didn't we move round like lightnin' on the double play
I'd look over in the stands and Marilyn should see me and she'd smile and wave
Hell no Coach Lombardi this old broken back ain't nothin' if the game was saved
And fellers if I don't pull through just put a little golden football on my grave
John Wayne he once said to me them Japs will take the Island
And we've got to save the old Red White and Blue
Someone's got to swim out to the submarine and warn 'em
And Bare you know I hate like hell to ask you to
Me and Tony Zarro we used to spar together up in Stillman's Gym
Knowin' someday it would be the Garden and the championship for me or him
And Coop if no one in this town is man enough to back you when Frank Miller comes
Then come High Noon I'll walk with you I may be young but I know how to use a gun
Judy Grable don't you cry you know you can be a star
And with my drinkin' I'd just hold you back
Go on and sign the contracts hon and I'll read about you
In some old newspaper blowin' cross some lonesome hobo camp
Me and Jimmie Rodgers we still ride them rollin' boxcars in the summer time
Jimmie he plays his guitar I lay back and watch the stars and sip my wine
Me and Audie Murphy we still crawl out on our bellies through the German lines
At away there's scooter shoot that ball to me and I swear we'll get two this time <start> 
You've been followin' me with your painted blue eyes
Since I walked in this bar and sat down
Just because my sweet baby is not by my side
Don't mean that I'm slipping around
So move a little farther along find somebody who is too weak to be strong
Check faces down the line stop looking at mine move a little farther along
Just because I've been by here a few times and stopped
Don't mean my heart's breaking in two
Even though I played sad songs on that old jukebox
There's no reason to think I need you
So move a little farther along
Move a little farther along <start> Goodnight Irene goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams.
Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in town
Sometimes I take a big notion
To jump in the river and drown.
And say Irene goodnight Irene
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams.
I love Irene God knows
I do love her till sea runs dry
And if Irene turns her back on me
I'll lay right down and I'll die.
And say Irene goodnight Irene
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams.
 Instrumental 
Last Saturday night I got married
Me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife just parted
So I'll take another stroll downtown.
Yeah Irene goodnight Irene
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams.
Hey rambler stop your ramblin'
Stop stayin' out late at night
Go home to your wife and the family
Stay by the fireside bright.
Yeah Irene goodnight Irene
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams.
 Instrumental 
Irene goodnight Irene
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams.
Irene goodnight Irene
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams... <start> You're losing interest in me and it's showing it's not a big thing but it's growing
The pain of heartbreak I've just started knowing it's not a big thing but it's growing
Every day the hurt grows bigger than before
But I'll pretend that I don't notice if I can hold you one day more
You got that look of someone who is going you're gonna leave me and it's showing
A little tear I can feel start to flowing it's not a big thing but it's growing
I've got a heartbreak now and it's showing you're gonna leave me and it's showing <start> 
Oh the games people play now
Every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say now
Never saying what they mean
Oh they whine away the hours
In their ivory towers
Til they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine
La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play
Oh they make one another cry
Break their hearts and they say goodbye
Cross their heart and they hope to die
That the other was to blame
Neither one will ever give in
So they gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' 'bout the way it might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame
La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play
Oh they teach how to meditate
Read your horoscope and teach you faith
The furthermore the hell with hate
Come on and get on board
Look around and tell me what you see
What's ahappenin' to you and to me
God grant me the serenity
To just remember who I am
La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play <start> I know you're not ready
To find a girl and call her steady
Looking back you might say we were just friends
And I'll say it's too late to make amends
Don't let it happen don't let it happen
You're gonna miss what you don't know
You'll wanna kiss
But you're letting me go oh oh
How come you don't see what I see
How come you don't feel what I feel
Someday we'll be too late and I'll point to the past
To make it perfectly plain
Don't let it happen don't let it happen
You're gonna miss what you don't know
You'll wanna kiss
But you're letting me go oh oh
Our future is dangerous
Who knows where we'll be
I've already read the letter
You're gonna write to me wha'
I guess there's no reason to try
It can be foolish to explain what is better kept quiet
No words will convince you to see
I'm gonna fly too far for you to catch me
Don't let it happen don't let it happen
You're gonna miss what you don't know
You'll wanna kiss
But you're letting me go oh
Don't let it happen
Don't let it happen
Don't let it happen <start> Don't waste your time givin' me your reasons
Let's skip the ceremony of goodbye
Let's get down to the part where you are leavin'
You can space me all the who what when's and whys
Chorus
Go on and go
Just hit the road
You won't find me standin' in your way
If you're not happy with me
Then I'll gladly set you free
Go on and go away
You want to talk this through to make it easy
A breakup just as painless as can be
And there's that line that you never meant to hurt me
Well you're just trying to clear your conscience as you leave
ChorusRepeat x <start> look close
see what you can see
the turn of a smile
on her face
the shadows that fall
from her hair
that she wears
like a crown
my my you have her beautiful eyes
can you see them
my my you have her beautiful eyes
can you see them
look close
there's the thing you dream of
written in silver
and ash
see how it hides
in the shape
of her chin
in the smooth
of her skin
my my you have her beautiful eyes
can you see them
my my you have her beautiful eyes
can you see them
i can see them
i can <start> Fools never learn you play with fire and you gonna get burn
You and I are fools we play with love so we gonna get burn
Fools that's what we are fools we've gone too far I know
But then love you come to me your eyes on fire you tempted me
Love knows no bound beggar or king it'll bring you down
Fools find love somehow fools we can't stop now I know
But then love this I know fool I may be I can't let go
Love this I know fool I may be I can't let you go fool I may be I can't let you go <start> It was more like a dream than reality
I must have thought it was a dream while she was here with me
When she was near I didn't think she would leave
When she was gone it was too much to believe
So with tomorrow I will borrow
Another moment of joy and sorrow
And another dream and another with tomorrow
So if there some day won't be time just to look behind
There won't be reasons no descriptions for my place and mind
There was so much I was told that was not real
So many things that I could not taste but I could feel
So with tomorrow I will borrow
Another moment of joy and sorrow
And another dream and another with tomorrow <start> I was sitting on top of the world
Deep in love with a blueeyed girl
But the blueeyed girl told me goodbye
I fell like rain drops out of the sky
Down at the bottom of a broken heart
You will find her name
Written on a block of stone
That once was a burning flame
Now it's cold lonely and dark
Way down here at the bottom of a broken heart
I took my love for Sally Ann
And I buried if deeper than a chinaman
Where no one goes and no one can see
There ain't nobody here but me
Down at the bottom of a broken heart
You will find her name
Written on a block of stone
That once was a burning flame
Now it's cold lonely and dark
Way down here at the bottom of a broken heart
One day true love's gonna set me free
But till then i'll be here deep in misery
Down at the bottom of a broken heart
You will find her name
Written on a block of stone
That once was a burning flame
Now it's cold lonely and dark
Way down here at the bottom of a broken heart <start> music and lyrics by Corb Lund
I heard all them pretty girls singin all them pretty words and how
I heard all them pretty girls singin all them pretty words oh wow
Now I'm sick and broken hearted and I know what that song means now
I heard em sing old blues and sing about the mules and plough
I heard em sing their blues and sing about their mules and plough
Now I'm hardscrabble farmin and I know what that song means now
Reveille was called and I thought about the laurel bough
Reveille was called and I dreamt about the laurel bough
My legs have both been shattered and I know what that song means now
My sons have both been slaughtered and I know what that song means now
I heard a little bird chirp and then I thought I heard a meow
I heard a little bird he chirped and then I thought I heard a meow
But I been walking around hungry and I know what that song means now
I heard em sing the hymns and I heard fire and brimstone avowed
I heard em sing their hymns and in tongues I heard brimstone avowed
But brother I found the Lord and I know what that song means now
And that collection plate goes round and I know what that song means now <start> You used to love me a lot you said that I was the best
Although you didn't agree with the way that I dressed
We were the business oh what a term
Now our hillbilly heaven's turned into a bad bad dream
Is it something you drank is it something you ate
Did I somehow rain on your hit parade
I can't please you no there ain't no way
I'm gonna wash my hands of you
I'm gonna wash my hands of you <start> Well I never felt nothing like I did tonight
You had the face of a boy that I met in a dream one time
Some heard it thunder and so did I
I swear it happened when your eyes met mine
Maybe it was just the way the wind blew
Maybe it was God and his son too
But in that moment I know that I knew that I
I found you
I saw a light I
Heard a bell
You were the very best feeling that I ever felt
And suddenly you are standing here mine all mine well
I saw a light I saw a light
Well I still can't believe someone left you laying around
Something precious like you should have already been found
What if I'd stayed home and done nothing tonight
What if you had looked left and I had looked right
For once in our lives we were both on time and now
I found you
I saw a light I
Heard a bell
You were the very best feeling that I ever felt
And suddenly you are standing here
Mine all mine well
I saw a light I
Saw
Somebody told me
When I was younger
Chance is like lightning
Love is like thunder
So I walked right over
Asked for your number
'Cause somebody told me when I was younger
I saw a light I
Heard a bell
You were the very best feeling that I ever felt
And suddenly you are standing here before my eyes
The thunder in my heart it tells me you are mine well
I saw a light I
Saw
A light <start> I was lost in sin so long with no one to guide my way
My soul was in darkness had been for many a day
In that little community church house I heard that gospel song
I went inside to kneel and pray
Oh I kneeled down and prayed to my Savior
That He might hear and would accept me
And then I felt the holy spirit
I knew my soul was saved in me
In that little community church house that's where we sang and prayed
We prayed to our Father to guide us on our way
All through life's long journey we'll need His helping hand
Until we reach that promised land
In that little community church house among my many friends
I can hear them praying for me and the preacher said amen
And the vision there before me it was my Savior's face
I knew that I was saved by grace <start> No more dirty dishes in the sink when I come home
I don't have to worry if I'll spend the night alone
I can go to sleep and leave my record player on
You're not there to hear me if I cry
There's no way to say how much your leavin' turned me on
I get so excited when I realize you're gone
You're just like another verse in some old country song
I got tired of singin' long ago
I don't even miss you when I go to bed at night
Gee it's great to know that I'll win each and every fight
No one's arms to hold me after I turn out the light
And I don't even miss you anymore
I don't have to feed the dog or take the garbage out
It don't matter if the neighbors hear me when I shout
Since you're gone there's not much that I have to think about
I'm so happy being all alone
There's no more dirty dishes

 <start> Don't come around me with those sweet lies I don't wanna hear them anymore
I tried so hard to make a good girl out of you
It's all around now that's the way the wind blows
You want to hurt me one more time now why you do girl goodness knows
Again they'll return that a poor boy have to give
Now I'm movin' on that's the way the wind blows
That's the way the wind blows that's the way the love goes
One day it's warm the next it's cold
I'll find it hard little girl to say goodbye
But I'm on my way that's the way the wind blows
You made a fool of me too many times now I guess my love for you still shows
But this time I'm leaving you just wait and see
I'm a long time gone that's the way the wind blows
That's the way the wind blows. <start> It's good to see you you're looking fine love sure looks good on you
That smile you're wearing makes it so plain to see
Love looks good on you but how blue look on me
I'm glad you're happy while I'm feeling so blue love sure looks good on you
That smile you're wearing makes it so plain to see
Love looks good on you but how blue look on me
Now I'll admit that he's won you and I'll admit that love becomes you
Now you've got everything except my memory
Love looks good on you but how blue look on me
Yes I'll admit that he's won you
Love looks good on you but how blue look on me <start> I fell head over heels in love with you last night
After all those Mr. Moms I found Mr. Right
I was just about to settle in
When I got those feelings again
the next thing that I knew
I had on my walkin shoes.
Chorus
There I go again
Wont somebody please help me
This merrygoround that Im on got me weak in the knees
running from the kind of love I wanted to fall in
I dont know where how why what or when
But there I go again
Ive tried therapy psychology and wine
They all tell me theres a cure for my state of mind
but they dont know what theyre talking about
Cause when I work Im working things out
could my diagnosis be theres nothing wrong with me
Chorus
There I go again
Wont somebody please help me
This merrygoround that Im on got me weak in the knees
running from the kind of love I wanted to fall in
I dont know where how why what or when
But there I go again
In Situations full of complications
Through the edge of reason
I think I found my destination
There I go
Chorus
There I go again
Wont somebody please help me
This merrygoround that Im on got me weak in the knees
running from the kind of love I wanted to fall in
I dont know where how why what or when
But there I go again
No I dont know where how why what or when
But there I go again
There I Go <start> When the freedom you've know has left you a broken man
When everything you've ever owned slipped thru your hands
Well it don't really matter at all and you don't give a damn
Oh the fortunes that shackled the heart and the soul of a man
Some men search for silver some men look for gold
But you have found a treasure their pockets will never hold
Some men look forever and still they never find
They don't know that freedom is just a state of mind
When you've burned all your bridges and you've covered all your tracks
Well it goes with out sayin' there's never no turnin' back
When the highway to nowherehas finally came to an end
Well they might think you're crazy when you tell 'em you'ed do it again
Some men search for silver... <start> Sure he gives me everything I ask for a kind of love that I never knew
And every night he comes home at the same time
But he'll never ever take the place of you
He kisses me goodbye every morning does the little things you've always used to do
But no matter how he tries it ain't the same thing
'Cause he'll never ever take the place of you
So don't try to see me when you come back to town
I finally found myself up straight so please don't drag me down
I'll be good to him I'll make him happy I owe him so much what else can I do
And our little boy already calls him daddy still he'll never ever take the place of you
No he'll never know oh that I still love you so
And he'll never ever take the place of you <start> Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skippidity do da day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A.
Good morning morning
Hello sunshine
Wake up sleepy head
Why'd we move that bojangle clock so far away from the bed
Just one more minute
That's why we moved it
One more hug would do
Do you love waking up next to me
As much as I love waking up next to you
You make the coffee
I'll make the bed
I'll fix your lunch
And you fix mine
Now tell me the truth
Do these old shoes look funny
Honey it's almost nine
Now you be careful
Gotta go I love you
Have a beautiful day
And kiss the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A.
Skippidity do da
Thank you oh Lord for making him for me
And thank you for letting life turn out the way
That I always thought it could be
There once was a time when I could not imagine
How it would feel to say
I'm happiest girl in the whole U.S.A
Now shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skippidity do da day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A.
Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skippidity do da day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A.
Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skippidity do da day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A. <start> When I left I left walkin' wounded
I made my escape from the rain
Still a prisoner of hurt
I had months worth of work
Just freein' my mind of the pain
I had hours of sittin' alone in the dark
Listenin' to sad songs and comin' apart
Lord knows I made crying an art
Woe is a slow healing heart
A slow healing heart dyin' to mend
Longin' for love lonely again
When the spirit is broken
And the memories start
Nothin' moves slower
Than a slow healing heart
How I prayed for blind faith to lead me
To places where I'm not afraid
Now I'm doin' fine both in body and mind
Some hurts take longer to fade
But there's a part of my feelings ever on guard
Against looks that are tender and words that are hard
'Cause I still remember those cutting remarks
Oh it's painful a slow healing heart
A slow healing heart dyin' to mend
Longin' for love lonely again
When the spirit is broken
And the memories start
You know nothin' moves slower
Than a slow healing heart
Oh nothin' moves slower
Than a slow healing heart <start> Each time I hold somebody new my arms grow cold aching for you
No one can take your place darling in my embrace I'll never be free
And when my lips burn with desire no other's kiss can put up the fire
Though I may try and try no one can satisfy this longing in me
I'll never be free from your smile so tender the sweet surrender in your eyes
How can I be free when I still remember how you could thrill me with a sigh
Just like a chain bound to my heart your love remains when we're apart
Each kiss I gave to you made me a slave to you I'll never be free
I'll never be free from your smile... <start> Your best friend your best girl just made a big messy world
'Cause arm in arm they left you feelin' blue
She set a trap you got caught
You should've took her with a grain of salt
So have a little faith and love will come to you
So she's leavin' for somebody new
She's even got you believin' there's nothin' you can do
But brush that teardrop off your face
And put a smile back in its place
Just have a little faith and love will come to you
Beyond the clouds the sky is always blue
Have a little faith and love will come to you
So don't be lonely and don't be blue
Your one and only is somewhere waiting just for you
Two lovin' arms to hug your neck
Right around the corner where you least expect
She'll be there with love to pull you through
Just have a little faith and love will come to you <start> You told me that you cared that you would never lie
I saw you in another's arms and I hung my head and I cried
Hung down my head and cried hung down my head and I cried
I saw you in another's arms and I hung my head and I cried
I prayed to God above to give me wings to fly
To fly away to another world and I hung my head and I cried
Hung down my head and cried <start> You And Your Sweet Love
I wish you only knew all the days I've made it through
Because of you and your sweet love
I wish that I could count the times peace and comfort filled my mind
Because of you and your sweet love
You're what keeps me going the sun that lights my sky
The rose that blooms in winter the rain that cools July
Never try to tell me it wasn't God above
That sent me you and your sweet love
Almost every night it seems you come walking through my dreams
Precious you and your sweet love
And tonight though we're apart there's a fullness in my heart
Thanks to you and your sweet love
You're the rock I cling to that star I wish upon
The water in my desert the anchor in my storm
Oh never try to tell me that it wasn't God above
That sent me you and your sweet love
He sent me you and your sweet love <start> Sometimes I don't even know where this dirty road is taking me
Sometimes I don't even know the reasons why
I guess I'll keep on ramblin' lots of booze and lots of gamblin'
It's easier than just waitin' around to die
I had a ma I even had a pa
He hit her with a belt once cause she cried
Told him to take care of me headed back to Tennessee
It was easier than just waitin' around to die
I came of age and I met a girl in a Tuscaloosa bar
She cleaned me out and hit it on the sly
I tried to kill the pain I bought some wine and hopped to train
Was easier than just waitin' around to die
A friend said he knew where some easy money was
We robbed a man and brother did we fly
They caught up with me they drug me back to Muskogee
Four long years waitin' around to die <start> The one I love so much told me goodbye it hurt so much but I didn't cry
I let a smile hide my misery mama you'd have been proud of me
Yesterday I thought to him just like a friend smiled and asked him how he'd been
Said I hope you're happy as can be mama you'd have been proud of me
And if you could have seen me today I'd smile and laugh in my old carefree way
They thought that I was like I'd like to be mama you'd have been proud of me
Mama you'd have been proud of me <start> I'm gonna walk that milky white way oh Lord some of these days
I'm gonna walk that milky white way some of these days
I'm gonna walk up and take my stand gonna join the Christan Band
I'm gonna walk that milky white way oh Lord some of these days
I'm gonna tell my mother hurry when I get home
I'm gonna tell my mother hurry when I get home
Well well well I wanna tell my mother hey
I wanna tell my mother hey when I shake the hands that day
That's when I walk that milky white way some of these days
I'm gonna meet God Father and God Son
I'm gonna mee God Father and God Son
I wanna tell them bout my troubles in this world I just come from
That's when we walk that milky white way oh Lord some of these days
That's when we walk that milky white way oh Lord some of these days <start> Right now gonna take you in my arms
Hold you closer and tighter than I ever have
I'm gonna say all the things that I thought could wait
Now I realize that later could be a little too late
Baby let's love like there's no tomorrow
Live for every moment
Laugh at least a little everyday
If we see the sun rise in the morning
Is impossible to say
So let's love like there's no tomorrow
Today
From now on on every time we kiss
It's gonna mean
So much more when I touch your lips
When I give myself to you
Baby I won't hold nothin' back
Cause there's nothin' I wouldn't give
To make every minute last
Baby let's love like there's no tomorrow
Live for every moment
Laugh at least a little everyday
If we see the sun rise in the morning
Is impossible to say
So let's love like there's no tomorrow
Today
Baby let's love like there's no tomorrow
Live for every moment
Laugh alittle everyday
If we see the sun rise in the morning
Is impossible to say
So let's love like there's no tomorrow
Today <start> Rain drippin' off the brim of my hat sure is cold today
Here I am walkin' down  wish she hadn't done me that way
Sleepin' under a table in a roadside park why a man could wake up dead
But it sure seems warmer than it did sleeping in my king size bed
Is anybody going to San Antone or Phoenix Arizona
Anyplace is all right as long as I can forget I've ever known her
 steel  guitar 
Wind whippin' down the neck of my shirt like I ain't got nothing on
But I'd rather fight the wind and rain than what I've been fighting' at home
Yonder comes a truck with the US Mail people writin' letters back home
Tomorrow she'll probably want me back but I'll still be just as gone
Is anybody going to San Antone...
Is anybody going to San Antone... <start> Don't look inside
No don't look there
'Cause you might find
Yourself somewhere
Walkin' 'round
Lost and alone
Without one clue
That it's a long way home
Years and years
Is a lot of time
To drag your heart across
Every rock you find
Hate is deep
And its pull is strong
But the passion's short
Then it's a long way home
I can't take
One single step for you
But I might just help
To find some
small pathway through
Don't look back
'Cause you might see
Just how far
All that used to be
Just let your mind
Think on what's gone
And then you'll know
That it's a long way home
Yeah you'll know
That it's a long way home
You'll find out
That it's a long way home
There ain't no doubt
That it's a long way home <start> She labored so hard in this world below
She didn't have things that most mothers know
Raising her children on a widow's small pay
Washing and ironing since dad passed away
I wanna go to heaven when this life is over
I wanna be with Jesus on eternity shore
But if I've a crown coming when rewards go around
Please blessed Jesus give mother my crown
I didn't realize it when I was a lad
Just how great a burden my mother had
Adoption was offered but mama said no
She raised us and taught us the right way to go
I wanna go to heaven when this life is over
I wanna be with Jesus on eternity shore
But if I've a crown coming when rewards go around
Please blessed Jesus give mother my crown <start> On the warm summer's evening on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a starin' out window at the darkness
Till boredom overtook us and he commenced to speak.
He said Son I made a life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what the cards were by the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin' I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I would give you some advice.
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he'd bummed a cigarette then he bummed a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
He said If you gonna play the game boy you gotta learn to play it right.
You you gotta know when to hold 'em know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin' is done.
Now every gambler knows that the secret to survival
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowin' what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner just like every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.
So when he finished speaking he turned back toward the window
Crushed out his cigarette faded off to sleep
Somewhere in the darkness the gambler he broke even
In his final words I found an ace that I could keep.
You gotta know when to hold 'em know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin' is done.
You gotta know when to hold 'em know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin' is done.
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin' is done... <start> Go ahead and lead me on
Tell me you never do this
Take my keys and steal my kiss
Let the lies roll off your lips
You go ahead and lead me on
Tonight
A little bit of wrong could be alright
And when you're gone
Hey what's some worst one more goodbye could do
You can't hurt me cause I can't love you
No need to skate around where this is going
You can't break what's broken
I don't wanna be alone
With all these jagged pieces
You can't unwreck the wreck she left
But we could rearrange the mess
And I don't wanna be alone
Tonight
A little bit of wrong could be alright
And when you're gone
Hey what's some worst one more goodbye could do
You can't hurt me cause I can't love you
No need to skate around where this is going
You can't break what's broken
Hey what's some worst one more goodbye could do
You can't hurt me cause I can't love you
My heart's so far beyond repair
You don't have to handle me with care
No need to skate around where this is going
You can't break what's broken broken
You can't break what's
So go ahead and lead me on <start> If you listen I'll sing you a sweet little song
Of a flower that's now dropped and dead
Yet dearer to me yes than all of its mates
Though each holds aloft its proud head.
Twas given to me by a girl that I know
Since we've met faith I've known no repose.
She is dearer by far than the world's brightest star
And I call her my wild Irish Rose.
My wild Irish Rose the sweetest flower that grows.
You may search everywhere but none can compare with my wild Irish Rose.
My wild Irish Rose the dearest flower that grows
And some day for my sake she may let me take the bloom from my wild Irish Rose.
They may sing of their rose which by other names
Would smell just as sweetly they say.
But I know that my Rose would never consent
To have that sweet name taken away.
Her glances are shy when e'er I pass by
The bower where my true love grows
And my one wish has been that some day I may win
The heart of my wild Irish Rose.
My wild Irish Rose the sweetest flower that grows.
You may search everywhere but none can compare with my wild Irish Rose.
My wild Irish Rose the dearest flower that grows
And some day for my sake she may let me take the bloom from my wild Irish Rose. <start> It's that time of day again when dreams drift my way again
My thoughts start to stray again at sunset
Your mem'ry is crystal clear and visions of yesteryear
Are sprinkled with silver tears at sunset
This is the moment that I miss you most of all
At the end of the day just before the shadows fall
Moon skies unfold a purple horizon with colors of crimson and gold
Such beauty still takes my breath but I feel an emptiness
'Cause I see your silhouette at sunset
It's that time of day again when dreams drift my way again
My thoughts start to stray again at sunset <start> I've got my souvenirs that's one thing you can't take away
I've got all my memories of yesterday
Though you've gone and left me here to cry these tears
You can break my heart but you can't take my souvenirs
I can't forget the day we met so long ago
The first time that we kissed I knew I loved you so
All these these things're burned into my memories
The souvenirs that you can't take away from me
I've got my souvenirs
I keep your letters and I keep your Valentines
Wonder signs of love that say you'll be mine
I still have your picture hangin' on the wall
They're my souvenirs and I'm glad I kept them all
I've got my souvenirs
You can break my heart but you can't take my souvenirs <start> When I woke up this morning everything seemed wrong
I'd realized my greatest fear the one our love was gone
She left in a world of emptiness I'm wondering what happened to my happiness
The reason for it all was in a letter that I've found
All she said and all I read was Joe is back in town
Joe is back in town that's what she said today she let me down wish I was dead
I was standing in for him I know but still I hang around
A hoping she might love me knowing she would leave me
Anytime that Joe is back in town 
Joe is back in town that's what she said <start> Girl I know that I promised you
I could make your every dream come true
But I admit I've got a little ways to go
Trust me baby we're closin' in quick
Before you know it we'll be stckin' the bricks
So stick like glue we got nothin' to lose
And baby don't stop we're just a gettin' started
Don't quit now we got our foot in the door
Say you're not about to end the party
Baby hang on tight just a little bit more
I stand behind every word I say I love you baby
There's your reason to stay
Don't be flip floppin' when you know that we're rockin' along
I can't believe you want to throw in the towel
Stop and think of what I'm talking about
You threw your hat in the ring so go and get that thing
And baby don't stop we're just a gettin' started
Like an old violin or vintage wine all good things come in good time
We might run out of road but it ain't the end of the line
Honey I swear up and down our turn's about to come around
We'll have it all in the long haul
And baby don't stop we're just a gettin' started
Oh baby don't stop we're just a gettin' started <start> Bobby Bare
Willie Jones was a man I met when I lived in Baltimore
I was a guard and he was doing time
In the three long years he stayed there I got to know him well
Willie Jones he was a friend of mine
He used to say buddy you know where I'm going when they let me out of here
Alabama could be heaven if the Lord was there
And he talked about the southland though he'd drifted from its shores
I never seen a man who loved it more
He talked about the whippoorwills in the Alabama night
Honeysuckle vine and sugar cane
Swimming holes and fishing poles and early morning frost
And sleeping under a tin roof when it rained
He talked about a country road and a cabin in the pines
And a girl with wavy long chestnut brown hair
He talked about the beauty of his Blue Ridge Mountain home
And darn near made me think that I was there
He used to say buddy you know where I'm going when they let me out of here
Alabama could be heaven if the Lord was there
When a man ain't got no freedom the time sure passes slow
Willie Jones had ten long years to go
It's been almost a years now since that hot night in July
Willie hit the guard and jumped the fence
I had my rifle ready but I couldn't let it fly
I shot over his head and we ain't seen him since
Then last week the postman brought a letter to my door
Marked No Return Address and No Reply
It just said nobody north of Birmingham is gonna see this boy again
But if you're ever down our way won't you please drop by
He used to say buddy you know where I'm going when they let me out of here
Alabama could be heaven if the Lord was there
And he talked about the southland though he'd drifted from its shores
I never seen a man who loved it more <start> Now I was just a girl of two
Now I was just a girl of two
With a golden heart and a button shoe
The devil had a hold of me
The devil had a hold of me
I turned my head and I could see
The devil had a hold of me
There was something wrong with the butcher's boy
Was something wrong with the butcher's boy
He trembled in his hand and voice
The devil had a hold of me
The devil had a hold of me
The others knew to let him be
But the devil had a hold of me
Now the tailpipe spit and the engine roared
The tailpipe spit and the engine roared
I's waving out the Plymouth door
And the devil had a hold of me
The devil had a hold of me
The old folks saw the last they'd see
The devil had a hold of me
I dreamed last night that my time was done
I dreamed last night that my time was done
And my soul flew up to the holy son
But the devil had a hold of me
The devil had a hold of me
I snapped back down when he pulled my lead
The devil had a hold of me
There're those who'll laugh and not believe
There're those who'll laugh and not believe
Until you feel that touch upon your sleeve
The devil had a hold of me
The devil had a hold of me
I turned my head and I could see
The devil had a hold of me
I turned my head and I could see
The devil had a hold of me <start> Someone before me still turns you inside out
When we're together she's all you talk about
You're always wanting me to do the things she used to do
Someone before me sure left her mark on you
I've tried to get inside your heart but I don't stand a chance
I can see she's on your mind with every little glance
You're living on old mem'ries my love can't get through to you
Someone before me sure left her mark on you
 guitar 
I've tried to get inside your heart... <start> She came in the door and walked to the bar and I guess my face turned white
I hadn't seen her in a long time and I didn't want to see her tonight
The lady who was sharing the table with me said is that somebody you know
I watched as a stranger bought her a drink and I said you might say so
She's a mistake I made when I was twentyone
I did a lot of crazy things back when I was young
And I've still got her footprints on my heart and on my mind
She's a mistake I made when I was twentyone
And twentyfour and twentyeight and twentynine
She thought my heart was a revolving door she came and went as she pleased
For every night I spent in her arms I spent two on my knees
Begging her to stay and live in my world needing her desperately
Look up fool in the dictionary and you'll find a picture of me
She's a mistake I made
There's no fool like a young fool I've heard 'em say
But I'm not sure that I'm mature enough to walk away even today
She's a mistake I made <start> Honey you're amazing the way you always look so good
Darlin' you always know what to say to put me in the right mood
Whenever a little touch turns into a kiss
Baby how can it get any better than this
Chorus
When it comes to love ooh baby we've got the right stuff
Every beat of our hearts poundin' with the rhythm of the right stuff
Honey your love is heaven Darlin' hold me tight
We're goin' out of this world tonight
When it comes to love ooh baby we've got the right stuff
Honey I bought you some flowers for our anniversary
Darlin' I remember the night when you first walked up to me
And baby we knew with just one look
That the title page would write the whole book
Chorus
We've got the right stuff baby
I'm your man and I'm your lady
Chorus <start> How is she is she well is she happy could you tell
Is it all working out the way she wanted it to
Did her expressions change when you mentioned my name
No don't answer that just tell me how is she
I guess the less I know of her the better off I'm bound to be
I don't really wanna hear she's happy without me but how is she
I just gotta know I still miss her so you seen her I know so tell me how is she <start> It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch
It's knowing I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bons
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks
And I'd be planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
You're movin' on the back roads by the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junk yards and the highways come between us
And some other woman crying to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still run in silence tears of joy stain my face
And a summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walking on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind <start> I'm gonna wear my flipflops and
I'm gonna play some flipcup and
Rock a little bit of hiphop and Haggard and Jagger
And throw a  on the corn hole game
If I'm lucky yeah I might get laid
The way that it's going the keg gon' be floating
All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my laid back ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on gettin' my sun daze on
Girl you know you're the life of my party
You can stay and keep sippin' Bacardi
Stir it up as we turn on some Marley
If you want you can get on Harley
I sit you up on a kitchen sink
Stick the pink umbrella in your drink
The way that we're feeling we gone by this evening
But all I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my laid back ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on gettin' my sun daze on <start> 
Everytime the bluebird sings
My heart takes wings to the sky
The bluebird greyside fly
To my place in your eyes
Cause after all I did all I could
And you did your best just the same
Nobody won we both lost no one's to blame
But I'll fly away to you if only pretending
We'll be like bluebirds do the beautiful lie
The beautiful lie the beautiful lie
Everytime the bluebird sings
My heart takes wings to the sky
The bluebird greyside fly
To my place in your eyes
Cause after all I did all I could
And you did your best just the same
Nobody won we both lost no one's to blame
But I'll find my way to you if I'm only pretending
And we'll be like bluebirds live the beautiful lie
We'll be like bluebirds live the beautiful lie <start> I must look just like a fool here in the middle of the road
Standin' there in your rear view gettin' soaked to the bone
This land is flat as it is mean a man can see for a hundred miles
So I'm still prayin' I might see the glow of a brake light
But your wheels just turn down the road ahead
If it hurts at all you ain't showed it yet
I keep lookin' for the slightest sign
That you might miss what you left behind
I know there's nothin' stopping you now
But I'd settle for a slowdown
I held on longer than I should believin' you might change your mind
And those bright lights of Hollywood would fade in time
But your wheels just turn down the road ahead
If it hurts at all you ain't showed it yet
I keep lookin' for the slightest sign
That you might miss what you left behind
I know there's nothin' stopping you now
But I'd settle for a slowdown <start> Rest 
I've been around the world I've seen it and I've lived it friend
I've been around the world and now it's time for me to rest
I've been around the world I've seen it yes I've lived it
I've been around the world and now it's time for me to go
Do you believe that love is God or do you feel the reverse
Do you believe a blessing is the absence of a curse
Do you believe you have no choice but let your life play out
Did you cut your own belief just to spite your doubt <start> SMOOTH TALKING BABY
WRITERS RED LANE DAVE KIRBY
Smooth talkin' baby I've been looking for you all my life it seems
Smooth talkin' baby maybe you're the meaning of my dreams
I've waited for so long for you to come alone
I thought that time would never fly
Do what you want to do say what you're wantin' to
I hear you talkin' with your eyes
Smooth talkin' baby I've been looking for you all my life it seems
Smooth talkin' baby maybe you're the meaning of my dreams
You knew right where I'd be you came to comfort me
I'm glad you heard my lonely cry
So dance me to the door so we can do much more
Than just talkin' with our eyes
Smooth talkin' baby I've been looking for you all my life it seems
Smooth talkin' baby maybe you're the meaning of my dreams <start> Let's just take our time
There's nothing else to do
What better way to spend the night
Wasting it with you
The moon has won the war
The daylight waits to win
Stay here by my side
We'll watch the struggle start again
I need you
Now and forever
To stay right here with me
Don't ever leave
Love was kept
From me like a secret
And I swore that I was through
Until you
Until you
The city's settled down
I watch you as you sleep
There's a silent celebration
For every breath you breathe
Now this all makes sense
With you as company
I left all I knew and found
The better part of me
Yeah yeah
I need you
Now and forever
To stay right here with me
Don't ever leave
Love was kept
From me like a secret
And I swore that I was through
Until you
The time it took to find you
I would wait again my baby
For the feelings that I feel with you now
I need you
Now and forever
To stay right here with me
Don't ever leave
Love was kept
From me like a secret
And I swore that I was through
Until you
Until you
Until you
Until you <start> I believe for every drop of rain that falls
A flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows.
I believe for everyone who goes astray
Someone will come to show the way.
I believe
I believe.
I believe above the storm the smallest prayer
Will still be heard.
I believe that someone in the great somewhere
Hears every word.
Every time I hear a new born baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky.
Then I know why
I believe.
Every time I hear a new born baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky.
Then I know why
I believe. <start> Ahh let's go honky tonkin'
Let's go honky tonkin'
Have a honky tonkin' good time with us
Ahh let's go honky tonkin'
Let's go honky tonkin'
Honky tonkin' round Texas
Well I'll put some diesel in the tank
Give that old Detroit a crank
We'll sit back and let that silver eagle fly
Well up and down that Lonestar State
Let's have a honky tonkin' tail gate
And don't forget to kiss your baby good bye

Stick out a thumb and bum a ride
Hitchhike across the country side
Come see why they call this place God's country
Well crisscross in the Colorado
From Amarillo to Zapata
Every town along the way from A to Z

Well my mom called me up
And she gave me my last warning
Said there'll be hell to pay
If I miss church this Sunday morning <start> Three thirty in the morning
Not a soul in sight
The city's lookin' like a ghost town
On a moonless summer night
Raindrops on the windshield
There's a storm movin' in
He's headin' back from somewhere
That he never should have been
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls
Every light is burnin'
In a house across town
She's pacin' by the telephone
In her faded flannel gown
Askin' for miracle
Hopin' she's not right
Prayin' it's the weather
That's kept him out all night
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls
The thunder rolls
And the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold
On a sleepless night
As the storm blows on
Out of control
Deep in her heart
The thunder rolls
She's waitin' by the window
When he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him
Thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain
A strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes
And he knows that she knows
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls <start> I'm gonna live it up so you can live it down I'm tired of being laughed like like a clown
Well see who's giving who the run around I'm gonna live it up so you can live it down
Well they say that every dog's a gonna have his day
Well now the time has come for this ol' hound to play
You'll find me where the lights're bright and gay
And while the sun shines I'll be a makin' hay
I'm gonna live it up...
 steel  guitar 
Well you've had me by the nose now long enough
But now I'm a gonna change and call you bluff
Stand back and gimme room to strap my stuff
And don't get in the way for the things might get rough
I'm gonna live it up...
I'm gonna live it up so you can live it down <start> Talk about sufferin' here below
And talk about lovin' Jesus.

And let's keep afollowin' Jesus. <start> Move slowly to my dresser drawers
Put my blue jeans on
Find my cowboy boots my button down
Strap my timepiece on my arm
Grab my billfold my pocket change
Just a mindless old routine
Then it's out the door and down the street
But it's not really me
I still comb my hair the same
Still like the same cologne
And I still drive that pickup truck
That the same old bank still owns
But since you left everybody says
I'm not the guy they've known
The lights are on but nobody's home
Cup of coffee in the morning
Just food for the brain
But I've been numb since our last goodbye
I haven't felt a thing
But now there's pains in my head
And pains in my chest
And I think I'm losing my hair
I'm a half a man with half a mind
To think you didn't care
Repeat chorus <start> Sad songs and tear drops
Will surely mend this broken heart
Time forgets these bitter things I feel
But your days are numbered
You'll learn your lesson well
When you finally play a heart that plays for real
There's a new fool somewhere waiting
For your old fashioned heartbreak love affair
She'll see through your intentions
With each lie that you tell
And the old ways will go out with the new somewhere
Leaving was so easy
But old hands do make fancy moves
And I for one fell victim to your game
But someday you'll see
That cold hearts can be broken too
What goes round must come around your way
There's a new fool somewhere waiting
For your old fashioned heartbreak love affair
She'll see through your intentions
With each lie that you tell
And the old ways will go out with the new somewhere <start> People say I'm no good
And crazy as a loon
'Cause I get stoned in the morning
And get drunk in the afternoon
Kinda like my old blue tick hound
I like to lay around in the shade
And I ain't got no money
But I damn sure got it made
'Cause I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
If I cant get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
Just leave this long haired country boy alone
Preacher man talking on T.V.
Puttin' down the rock and roll
Wants me to send a donation
'Cause hes worried about my soul
He said Jesus walked on the water
And I know that its true
But some times I think that preacherman
Would like to do a little walking too
But I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
If I cant get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
Ya just leave this long haired country boy alone
A poor girl wants to marry
And a rich girl wants to flirt
A rich man goes to college
And a poor man goes to work
A drunkard wants another drink of wine
And a politician wants a vote
I don't want much of nothin' at all
But I will take another toke
But I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
If I can't get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
Ya just leave this long haired country boy alone <start> The cattle prowled and the coyotes howled
Out on the Great Divide
I never done no wrong just singing a song
As down the trail I ride.
Rattle snacks rattle at the prairie dogs
You hear that mournful tune.
It's roundup time away out West
When the cactus is in bloom.
Daylight comes and the cowhand yell
They call out ev'ry man
I throw my saddle on my old cowhorse
And drink my coffee from a can
The sun goes down on the cattle trail
And I'm gazing at the moon
It's roundup time away out West
When the cactus is in bloom.
We don't have cold weather
It never snows or rains.
That is where the sunshine's best
Out on the western plains.
Some of the boys have gone away
But they will be back soon.
It's roundup time away out West
When the cactus is in bloom.
Daylight comes and the cowhand yell
They call out ev'ry man
I throw my saddle on my old cowhorse
And drink my coffee from a can
The sun goes down on the cattle trail
And I'm gazing at the moon
It's roundup time away out West
When the cactus is in bloom. <start> Thanks for the times that you've given me
The memories are all in mind.
And now that we've come
To the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud
Your once twice
Three times a lady
And I love you.
Yes your once twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
When we are together
The moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart.
To touch you to hold you
To feel you to need you.
There's nothing to keep us apart
You're once twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
I love you  <start> Filling up the girl
I am filling up the girl
Make her all of the whole world
Filling up the girl
And a brand new baby child
Makes me trunky
Makes me wild
Makes me trumpet of the swan
A brandnew footprintmaker born
I be ashtray I be star
I be monkey by Babar
I be hippo calling far
Far into the forest
And a shark I break its back
And an enemy attack
And chompers chomp
And then they crack
And then a baby's eaten <start> I am from the tiny town
Where I learned how to tough it out
Where I kicked the dirt an' my dreams around
To conquer the whole world
My uncle slipped me fifty bucks
Some rolled their eyes an' wished me luck
Yeah I spent the first night in the cab of my truck
An' I am still that girl
I like a challenge an' I like to fly
I'm not always perfect I'm not always right
When I go to weddings it always makes me cry
My heart is fragile an' I can be hurt
An' I can crumble inside at the drop of a word
But I can jump off a limb into a river of change
I'm taking back my brave
I kinda lost it for a while
I had to force myself to smile
An' I quit going that extra mile
Abandoned my belief
An' I spent hours on the phone
Crawlin' back to my comfort zone
Then I woke up one day said I'm not runnin' home
It's just not like me
'Cause I like a challenge an' I like to fly
I'm not always perfect I'm not always right
New born babies always make me cry
My heart is fragile an' I can be hurt
An' I can crumble inside at the drop of a word
But I can jump off a limb into a river of change
I'm taking back my brave
I'm my momma's only girl
The child in a mess

I've been pushin' the limits
Since I was little yeah yeah
Oh my heart is fragile an' I can be hurt
An' I can crumble inside at the drop of a word
But I can jump off a limb into a river of change
I'm taking back my brave
I'm taking back my brave yeah
Takin' it back back
I'm takin' it back back
I'm taking back my brave yeah
Takin' it back back <start> She said when I trusted love I dreamed in color too
But memories turn black and white at least mine do...
She said my brother you know he used to have this friend...
But this is now and that was then
It's better off just not to start
Than to have to watch us fall apart
All because of my second hand heart
I said if you could count up memories but only keep the best
You may not see how good they were without the rest
She said look I tried a lot
But I guess love it don't like me
Oh and by the way all those tries
Sure didn't come for free
So it's better off just not to start
Than to have to watch us fall apart
All because of my second hand heart
Second hand hearts
Second hand hearts
Second hand hearts
Second hand hearts
Are not just for parts
So I'll take away your sad luck baby
And you'll change mine
When hurt starts talkin' we'll say hey ya know we ain't got time
Then pick up all those small hopes back off the ground
'Cause after years of tears it's hard to say what's up or down
So if you will I'll try to start
And take the chance that we might fall apart
To try and save our second hand hearts
She said when I trusted love I dreamed in color too... <start> I've been with you for a fairly long time
May I call you may I call you may I call you mine
And you are near and been with me
May it always may it always may it always be
Please dont leave my side remember I love you
None of what I have done wrong was really done against you
If you love me and Im weak then weaker you must love me more
To reinforce whats all so strong and all the love we have in store
By example you showed me livings alright
Stay here with me stay here with me stay with me tonight
And come with me when I go to the bedroom
And well play bride and well play bride and well play bride and groom
If you had not been born you know
What would I What would I be then
I would not have strength to grow
And be counted and be counted among men
Please dont leave my side remember I love you
None of what I have done wrong was really done against you
If you love me and Im weak then weaker you must love me more
To reinforce whats all so strong and all the love we have in store
And in the morning well wrestle and ruin our stomachs with coffee
Wont we be wont we be wont be happy
We will rise in anger love and ardor
Shining shining shimmering in love's armor <start> It was forty or fifty years ago
A big shot played with time
Mister Walker held the door
And both kept cord and line
Watched and checked on every single day
Building his own special cars
His very special way
Ooh the new soft shoe
Ooh the new soft shoe
And then walking through a southern road
I saw a shoeshine stand
A man was talking to a crowd
Holding slippers in his hands
Don't you know the same thing happens
Each and every day
Did you ever hear a song
That's hard to even play
Ooh the new soft shoe
Ooh the new soft shoe
Then a color TV broadcast
Snuck in from New Orleans
Showed me one more man who spoke
And wore bright blue and green
When you saw him talk his way
Was when he showed his claws
And spoke to people every day
Just to get applause
Ooh the new soft shoe
Ooh the new soft shoe <start> Girl Ive got scars and Ive seen stars
From men nearly twice my size
Yeah lifes sticks and stones have broke a few bones
But Ive always survived
So when I take a look at all Ive took
It dont seem right to me
How a little bitty woman with just a few words
Come bring me to my knees
Sticks and stones wouldnt hurt a bit
Compared to the cold cruel words that just left your lips
Id rather you pick up a rock a stick full of thorns
Rear back and let em fly
Cause those sticks wouldnt cut stones hurt as much
As the sound of your goodbye
Yeah I know Im the reason for youre leavin
Im to blame sure enough
Its like you say there aint a woman made
That can live without true love
So if its too late to set things straight
And theres no forgivin me
Then dont say nothin just pick you up somethin
Thatll end this misery
Sticks and stones wouldnt hurt a bit
Compared to the cold cruel words that just left your lips
Id rather you pick up a rock a stick full of thorns
Rear back and let em fly
Cause those sticks wouldnt cut stones hurt as much
As the sound of your goodbye <start> It's summertime and the living is easy
Fish are jumping and the cotton is high
Your daddy's rich and your mama's goodlooking
Hush little baby don't you cry
Don't cry don't cry don't cry
No no no no
Don't cry don't cry
One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
You spread your wings and take to the sky
But until that morning there is nothing can harm you
With your daddy and mommy standing by
They are standing by I know don't cry
Summertime summertime summertime
And the living is living is easy
Fish are I know the fish are jumping
And cotton is so high
Your daddy is so so rich and your mama good
She had to be goodlooking
So hush little baby don't you cry
Don't you cry no no don't cry
No need to cry don't cry don't cry
Summertime summertime <start> I know there's nothing worse than a bad goodbye
And you think you'll feel better if you have a good cry
But save those tears for tomorrow when there's nothing better to do
It's a beautiful night don't waste it on the blues
Time is all it takes for a broken heart to mend
And sooner or later you know you'll try to love again
So why not start tonight you've only got the hurtin' to lose
There's a full moon out don't waste it on the blues
Don't waste one more minute
Leavin' a bad break to keep you home in the dark
There's nothin' like a walk in the moonlight
To let love run away with your heart
You could turn on your stereo and play your saddest songs
Sit by your window and stare out all night long
But if you look up you'll see the stars are just too bright to refuse
It's a beautiful night don't waste it on the blues <start> I hear people talkin' about going cold turkey
Dryin' out checkin' into Betty Ford
But I just can't relate to all those strange addictions
'Cause my drug problem never went ignored.
Chorus
You see I was drug to Church on Sunday morning
I was drug to family reunions
I was drug to Grandpa's farm to work every summer
And I was drugged to weddings and to funerals
I was drug out the door to go to school 
I was drug by my ears when I was bad
When I disobeyed my parents or my teacher
I was drug to the wood she'd by my Dad
And those drugs are still running through my veins
Still affecting everything I do and say
And if kids today had those kind of drug problems
I believe the world would be a better place.
 Instrumental 
I won't claim I grew up to be perfect 
But every time I start to make a slip
I can see Daddy reaching for the good book
And hear those prayers roll from Mama's lips.
That's why I count my blessings every evening
And pray to the good Lord up above
And thank him for giving me a drug problem
And a home and a family filled with love.
Chorus
Yea I was drug to Church on Sunday morning
I was drug to family reunions
I was drug to Grandpa's farm to work every summer
And I was drugged to weddings and to funerals
I was drug out the door to go to school 
I was drug by my ears when I was bad
When I disobeyed my parents or my teacher
I was drug to the wood she'd by my Dad
And those drugs are still running through my veins
Still affecting everything I do and say
And if kids today had those kind of drug problems
I believe the world would be a better place.
Chorus
You see I was drug to Church on Sunday Morning
I was drug to family reunions
I was drug to Grandpa's farm to work every summer
And I was drugged to weddings and to funerals
I was drug out the door to go to school 
I was drug by my ears when I was bad
When I disobeyed my parents or my teacher... <start> Making believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
I'll always dream still I'll never own you
Making believe its all I can do
Can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love you'll never be mine
Making believe that I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believe
Making believe that I never lost you
But my happy hours are fun and so few
My plans for the future will never come true
Making believe what else can I do
Can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love you'll never be mine
Making believe that I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believe <start> A stormy summer came and went
In the garden that we grew back then
I remember when
The single rose you gave to me
With a vow that you would never leave
One you didn't keep
Regretfully I understand
Why the flower crumbled in my hands
There's only eleven roses
I know I should have known it from the start
I think I know why there's only
Eleven roses left here to show
Something's missing from your heart
Pressed between the pages
I see the missing rose you couldn't find
From the years gone by
Sadly we just threw away
What could've been a beautiful bouquet
So I turned the page
Tonight I just can't bare to see
The faded rose that meant the most to me
There's only eleven roses
I know I should have known it from the start
I think I know why there's only
Eleven roses left here to show
Something's missing from your heart
The only thing that we forgot
Is do you love me or do you love me not
There's only eleven roses
I know I should have known it from the start
I think I know why there's only
Eleven roses left here to show
Something's missing from your heart
Only eleven roses <start> The night wind is sighin' the night bird is cryin' whippoorwill whippoorwill
He calls in the gloamin' to his mate that's roamin' whippoorwill whippoorwill
I sigh with the night wind oh come back my love
I cry with the night bird like some mournful dove
You say just forget me but that bird won't let me whippoorwill whippoorwill
 ac.guitar 
The wind bends the willows all wept with the rain
Your love plays on my heart string that sad sad refrain
You say just forget me but that bird won't let me whippoorwill whippoorwill whippoorwill <start> From the first breath of her life
She flew straight into my arms
I used to catch her from the swings
When she was five...
And now she dances on the wind
In a world as hard as stone
She's so anxious to begin
And ready to fly...
And she walks with me
And she talks with me
As she holds her hand in mine
I know she'll find her way
Like the light of day
Cause it's love that makes her strong
Though I cannot stop the rain
And I cannot turn the tide
And I'm sure there will be things
That break her heart
I can only let her know
I am always on her side
And even as I let her go
I'll never be far
And she walks with me
And she talks with me
In her eyes I see her truth
Born of her fire and grace
As she finds her place
Cause it's love that makes her strong <start> You'd stop at hundred and forty tears I forget the lonely years
I know I've been lost for words to say
I know my lonely heart would go wild you can bet I'd have to smile
If you should come back today
If you should come back I wonder what I'd act like
I wonder what I'd do I wonder what I'd say
I know that I do more than stand and smile while my crazy arms went wild
If you should come back today
 steel 
I've done a lotta lonely midnight walkin' and some crazy senseless talkin'
I've missed you every kind of way
I know I surely lose control like a love that's in my soul if you should come back today
If you should come back...
If you should come back today <start> She don't love you she's just lonely
She wasn't once upon a time
She used to dance when the band played
She used to be the trustin' kind
She's no stranger to the leaving
She's heard all the best goodbyes
Fallin' has a different meaning
To her you're just another guy
She don't love you she's just lonely
She don't know another way
To break free from what's been broken
Too many cowboys roll away
So forgive her if she's distant
She can't tell her heart to lie no
You'll never be her one and only
She don't love you she's just lonely
You can hold her in the moonlight
You can give her all the stars
You can promise her forever
But you'll never have her heart
She don't love you she's just lonely
She don't know another way
To break free from what's been broken
Too many cowboys roll away
So forgive her if she's distant
She can't tell her heart to lie no
You'll never be her one and only
She don't love you she's just lonely
She don't love you
She don't love you she's just lonely
She wasn't once upon a time
I remember her in the sunlight
I remember her when she was mine mine <start> Hotter than a dollar'
Grown man holler'
Dudes linin'up sayin' Oh yeah
From her boots to her collar
Legs are gettin' taller

To The Fine Lookin' Country Girl's
Ain't Nothin' Sweeter
Than A Fine Lookin' Country Girl <start> Yes I know she's the life of the party and without her things here would die
Oh but don't be fooled by her laughter she has her sad times she knows how to cry
She drinks and she talks just a little too loud
And with her pride gone she tags along with any old crowd
Yes I know I'm to blame and I feel so ashamed that I made her the image of me
I met her in a little country town she was simple and old fashion in some way
But she loved me till I dragged her down then she just gave up and drifted away
She drinks and she talks
That I made her the image of me <start> If you were mine Mary know what I'd do
I'd take the stars Mary and give them to you
If you were mine Mary know what I'd say
I'd say that I love Mary over again
All through the day
So if you love me please don't pretend
For there's a lifetime of happiness waiting round the bend
If you were mine Mary know what I'd do
I'd take my heart Mary and with all my love I'd give it to you
I'd take my heart Mary and with all my love I'd give it to you <start> Take me in your lifeboat take me in your lifeboat
It will stand the raging storm
Take me in your lifeboat take me in your lifeboat
It will bear my spirit home
Now come brothers and sisters and don't fall asleep
But pray night and day or you'll sink in the deep
Fathers and mothers are praying so well
Saying Lord won't you take us in your lifeboat
Take me in your lifeboat take me in your lifeboat
It will stand the raging storm
Take me in your lifeboat take me in your lifeboat
It will bear my spirit home
The clouds are so heavy the winds are so loud
The thunders are rolling bursting the clouds
They pray to their sinner mates for what they have done
They took the dying sinner in their lifeboat <start> 
You say your heart is broken that my love was just a token
You say this parting touch you like a knife
But if you let it grieve you your youth would surely leave you
Cause these should be the best years of your life
I know it won't be easy cause your memories are busy
And yet you're still too young for all the strife
So let me tell you like a brother go on out and find another
And these will be the best years of your life
You say that taste is bitter because you loved a quitter
But I'm not free to take you for a while
You're lucky that it's over cause somehow you recover
And these will be the best years of your life
I know it won't be easy <start> My father's name was Hannibal Mama was HannaMariah.
Everything we owned got all burned up in the great depression fire
Strip mines and one crop farming drained the green earth dry.
We lost it all till only love was left and that was the one thing money can't buy.
We're all Dust Bowl Children
Singin' the dust bowl song
Well the crops won't grow
And the dust just blows
When the green fields are gone.
When the green grass growing fields are gone.
When the green fields are gone.
When the green grass growing fields are gone.
Well they said in California there's work of every kind.
The only job that I got out there was waiting on a welfare line.
Once I had a dollar once I had a dream.
Now all the work is being done by a big ole machine.
We're all Dust Bowl Children
Singin' the dust bowl song
And the crops won't grow
And the dust just blows
When the green fields are gone.
When the green grass growing fields are gone.
When the green fields are gone.
When the green grass growing fields are gone. <start> Don't say it's over
Cause that's the worst news
I could hear I swear that I will
Do my best to be here just the way you like it
Even though its hard to hide
Push my feelings all aside
I will rearrange my plans and change for you
If I could go back
That's the first thing
I would do I swear that I would
Do my best to folow through
Come up with a master plan
A homerun hit a winning stand
A gaurantee and not a promise
That I'll never let your love slip from my hands
If it's the beaches
If it's the beaches' sands you want
Then you will have them
If it's the mountains' bending rivers
Then you will have them
If it's the wish to run away
Then I will grant it
Take whatever what you think of
While I go gas up the truck
Pack the old love letters up
We will read them when we forget why we left here <start> Ask the sky above and ask the earth below
Why I'm so in love and why I love you so
Couldn't tell you though I tried dear just why did I'm yours
When you went away you left a glowing spark
Trying to be gay as whistling in the dark
I am only what you make me come take me I'm yours
How happy I would be to beg and borrow a sorrow with you
Even though I knew tomorrow you'd say we were through
If we'd drift apart then I'll be lost alone
Though you use my heart just for a stepping stone
How can I help dreaming of you I love you I'm yours
If we'd drift apart
Hm I'm yours <start> Now this is a story about the young man from Natchez Mississippi
Whose father took a steamboat called the Delta Queen to New Orleans
And got killed in a poker game
The young man thought about it for awhile and then decided on revenge
And he said I'm gonna ride that steamboat
That steamboat took my daddy to New Orleans
He got killed in a poker game downtown
Steamboat took my daddy to New Orleans
Some poky Cajun gambler shot him down
Daddy rode that steamboat didn't take me along
And I've been sittin' there thinking all day long
And I'm a gonna ride that steamboat take my gun along
I'll get the man that done my daddy wrong
Steamboat took my daddy to New Orleans
Daddy was pretty good with a deck of cards
He said that he'd get rich in New Orleans
'Cause the game's too good and the cash is pourin' high
But you can win no money when the deck of cards you stack
And the steamboat never brought my daddy back
And I'm a gonna ride that steamboat take my gun along
I'll get the man that done my daddy wrong
Steamboat took my daddy to New Orleans
I know he wanted that money for us kids
Steamboat took my daddy to New Orleans
Now mama won't forgive the things he did
Daddy rode that steamboat never took mom along
And she's been sittin' there crying all day long
And I'm a gonna ride that steamboat take my gun along
I'll get the man that done my daddy wrong
I'll get that man who's done my daddy wrong <start> Though the miles are between us I thought our love would strengthen
As it has so many times before
But something has happened I can see it in your eyes
I can feel my world is crumblin' and the blues are at my door
The last letter that you wrote was on a blue piece of paper
That old feelin's back the clouds are moving in
The beginning of the end is near I feel your love has faded
Into darkness it seems I have no friend I feel the blues movin' in
 guitar 
Oh it's not the words you wrote that made me sad and broken hearted
That's put me in this sad shape I'm in
Tween the lines are mixed emotions and there's teardrops on the paper
You said that's all I'll write today I'll cose for now old friend
The last letter that you wrote...
 fiddle 
My state of mind is desperate and this hole that I'm sinking in
Gets deeper while I'm digging to get out
Oh please give the right answer to the questions I'm asking
Tell me you still love me that would turn my world about
The last letter that you wrote...
I feel the blues movin' in I feel the blues movin' in
 mandolin  fiddle  <start> May each moment I live be yours love may the best I can give be yours love
And from this moment on may a love that is strong and lives on and on be yours love
May the sons that I raise be yours love may the comforts I praise be yours love
If I ever get weak may the love words I speak and the arms that I seek be yours love
May the Lord's shining grace be yours love may the happiest face be yours love
May the last fingertips that touch these two lips as life from me slips be yours love <start> 
We'd worked ourselves senseless
Been bustin' down fences
Drivin' dry cattle no water in sight
As we sat 'round the fire
And cursed the barbed wire
A stranger broke into our light
Not knowin' no better
Some fool went for leather
But a whispered I wouldn't
Put an end to the fight
Then he said I'm for hire.
You need a rider.
And I don't mind ridin' at night.
Chorus
Go light on the Night Hawk
He don't smile he don't talk
To strangers and seldom to friends
And you'll do well to listen
When he asks you to leave him alone
He won't ask you again
Though the man is a myst'ry
The story is hist'ry
How a range fire came
Like a thief in the night
Took his young wife and babies
His wouldbes and maybes
And burned out the love in his life
Chorus
Go light on the Night Hawk
He don't smile he don't talk
To strangers and seldom to friends
And you'll do well to listen
When he asks you to leave him alone
He won't ask you again <start> I love you so much it hurts me darling that's why I'm so blue
I'm so afraid to go to bed at night afraid of losing you
I love you so much it hurts me and there's nothing I can do
I want to hold you my dear forever and ever I love you so much it hurts me so
I love you so much it hurts me... <start> Hold my hand let's not lose my way hold my hand and lead me home
Guide each step that I might take hold my hand and keep me strong
And let the path I walk be straight let the deeds I do be kind
Let me never hesitate to help my brother walking blind
Hold my hand...
And let my words have meaning of anything that I might speak
If you see me leaning on just hold my hand and straighten me
Hold my hand...
Amen <start> Lately I've been runnin'
Into our old friends
And somewhere in the small talk
Someone always asks where you've been
So I tell them what you told me
And they can't believe we're through
They ask me what I'm doin' now
And in case you're wonderin' too
I breathe in I breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
'Til you find
I'm that someone you can't live without
Until then
I breathe in and breathe out
I've got every reason
To find someone new
'Cause you swore up and down to me
That I've seen the last of you
But the way that you loved me
Girl left me hopin' and holdin' on
So until this world stops turning round
And my heart believes you're gone
I breathe in I breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
'Til you find
I'm that someone you can't live without
Until then
I breathe in and breathe out <start> Wondering wondering who's kissing you
Wondering wondering if you're wondering too
Every hour through the day since you went away
I keep wondering yes wondering if you're wondering too
I pray every night to the good Lord above
To send back to me the one I really love
Wondering wondering who's kissing you
Wondering wondering if you're wondering too
Every hour through the day since you went away
I keep wondering yes wondering if you're wondering too
I pray every night to the good Lord above
To send back to me the one I really love <start> There's never been a man
who could bring me down
I've walked away from the toughest of towns
But her last words tore me apart
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Brought me to knees like a shot from the dark
Her sweet love found its mark
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Her soft warm touch took me by surprise
I was blinded by the love in my eyes
The moment she left I felt the pain start
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Brought me to my knees
like a shot from the dark
Her sweet love found its mark
Her good bye hit me in the heart <start> The New York City folks say I'm too country the Grinny Village hippies call me square
But at the Long Horn barroom down in Dallas Texas
They call me the Texas Troubadour there
My home state of Texas you've been good to me your wide open spaces treat me fair
The girls are so much prettier down in Texas
They don't breathe that New York City polluted air
 steel 
The New York City sidewalks filled with people too busy to say hello to you there
With hearts as cold as the concrete that they walk on
They sure could use some clean fresh Texas air
Now Texas folks don't judge you till they know you
And they don't judge you then by what you wear
And you can feel at home anyplace in Texas
If you don't own a thing or if you're a millionaire
Now my home state of Texas... <start> It's a lovely old song
Ohh a rose must remain
With the sun and the rain or his lovely promise wont come true
To each his own
To each his own
And my own is you
What good is a song if the words just don't belong
And a dream must be a dream for two
To each his own
I have found my own
My one and only you
If a flame is to grow
There must be a glow
And to every door there's a key
I need you I know
And I can't let you go
Your touch means too much to me
Two lips must insist on two more to be kissed
Or they'll never know what love can do
To each his own
I have found my own
My one and only you
My one and only you <start> 
I never thought I'd see the day
That she'd set me free
Cause you know that little ring on my finger
Always felt like a ball and chain to me
All those threats I made about leavin
Suddenly became reality
She released me from my death row sentence
And said we'll sign the final papers in a week
Chorus
She handed me my walking papers
And said you're free to go
And celebrating felt in order
For I had escaped that prison of a home
But sittin in this old tavern
Surrounded by my good timing friends
I see I'll never make it on the outside
And I'm thinkin bout how I'm gonna break back in
Daylight found me sleepin in my car
On the other side of her street
And the grass that used to be my front yard
Had never before looked so green
And I'm tempted to break for the front door
But I'm sure she'd sic the dogs on me
Cause it looks like she's got a new inmate
Cause there's a pickup in the drive I've never seen
Chorus
I'm thinkin about how I'm gonna break back in <start> 
LeAnn

The cattle are prowlin'
The coyotes are howlin'
Way out where the doggies roam
Where spurs are a jinglin'
And the cowboy is singing
His lonesome cattle call

He rides in the sun
'Til his days work is done
And he rounds up the cattle each fall

Singing his cattle call
Eddy
For hours he would ride
On the range far and wide
When the night wind blows up and slow
His heart is a feather
In all kinds of weather
He sings his cattle call

He's browned as a fairy
From ridin' the prairie
And he sings with an western drawl
Singing his cattle call
LeAnn and Eddy
 <start> Got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
Lucky me can't you see I'm in love.
Got the world on a string
I can make the rain go
any time I snap my fingers
Lucky me can't you see I'm in love
Life is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so and so
If I should ever let go
I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world what a life
I'm in love <start> When you're feeling lonely lost and let down
Seems like those dark skies are following you around
And life's just one big shade of gray
You wonder if you'll see the light of day
Behind the clouds the sun is shining
Believe me even though you can't quite make it out
You may not see the silver lining
But there's a big blue sky waiting right behind the clouds
I've heard it said that this too shall pass
Good times or bad times neither one lasts
But thinking that your luck won't ever change
Is like thinking it won't ever stop once it starts to rain
Behind the clouds the sun is shining
Believe me even though you can't quite make it out
You may not see the silver lining
But there's a big blue sky waiting right behind the clouds
Yeah there's a big blue sky waiting right behind the clouds <start> I am the truth
I am Honesty
I am listening
When you speak to me
I can ease your pain
Make you stand out in the rain
And wander aimlessly
I am strong undeniable
I am not afraid unconditional
I can build you up
I can bring you to your knees
I'm unpredictable
Chorus
I am the way
I can set you free
Tear down the walls
Baby can't you see
Open your heart
Surrender all your fears
And put your faith in me
I'm all you need
I am love
I am young
I am old
I'm the breath of life
In every soul
I am happiness
I can warm you
When you're naked
Standing in the cold
Chorus x
I am the truth
I am honesty
I am listening When you speak to me <start> Well it looks like he's doin' what I didn't do
Givin' you love and money too it's over
Where do I go from here
Well I appreciate the nice goodbye
Not even a letter so that I
Could fool myself into thinkin' that you really cared
I tried to give you everything you wanted
But it looks like I got buried by the flame I started
Money can't buy the love we had
You can't do a thing for a love gone bad
But it cost me everything that I ever had
And even money can't buy back the love we had
Now there's nobody left for me to blame
If I could do it over I'd do it the same
I gave you my very best
You said you'd love me through thick and thin
But when one heart lies the other can't win for losin'
Where do I go from here
Money can't buy the love we had
You can't do a thing for a love gone bad
But it cost me everything that I ever had
And even money can't buy back the love we had <start> When I get up in the mornin'
And I face a brand new day
I know that you're beside me
Every Step of the way.
For so long now we've been lovers
Always been the best of friends
I raise my glass up to ya
As we start all over again.
I'll love you till the day that I die
With a feeling that will never grow old
I'll keep my arm around you
When you start to move a little slow.
And our love will never fade away
Our story will forever be told
You know where you can find me
When silver turns to gold.
Instrumental
I gave my heart away to you
The first time I felt the touch of your hand
And twentyfive years later
I still wanna be your man.
And I'll love you till the day that I die
With a feeling that will never grow old
I'll keep my arm around you
When you start to move a little slow.
And our love will never fade away
Our story will forever be told
You know where you can find me
When silver turns to gold.
You know where you can find me
When silver turns to gold... <start> I've always lived on the edge of life
And I don't fear the dark of night
I may be crazy but I'm not a fool
I'd be afraid of losing you
I've looked danger in the eye
I'm not afraid to live or die
But after all that I've been through
I'd be afraid of losing you
I couldn't face a single day
Without you in my life
Your sweet embrace is all it takes
To keep me satisfied
I've always been a restless soul
Hungered for the winding road
But a rebel heart still knows the truth
I'd be afraid of losing you
I couldn't face a single day
Without you in my life
Your sweet embrace is all it takes
To keep me satisfied
I've always lived on the edge of life
I don't fear the dark of night
I may be crazy but I'm not a fool
I'd be afraid of losing you
I'd be afraid of losing you
I may be crazy but I'm not a fool
Yes I'd be afraid of losing you <start> What a gray cloudy mornin' I rise from my bed
And I wonder if he meant all the things that he said
Well I think of all the good times but the bad times came along
Now it doesn't matter 'cause he's gone.
Now I'm alone again I cry in my sleep
I wonder why he left his love I tried to keep
I don't understand him and I guess I never will
He could always make my heart stand still
He may not have loved me or cared for me at all
But through all the teardrops he sure made me fall
And when we were together my world was in a spin
I will never love him again
Now I'm alone again I cry in my sleep
I wonder why he left his love I tried to keep
I don't understand him and I guess I never will
He could always make my heart stand still
Yes he could always make my heart stand still <start> He didn't have to wake up
He'd been up all night
Laying there in bed listening
To his new born baby cry
He makes a pot of coffee
He splashes water on his face
His wife gives him a kiss and says
It gonna be OK
It wont be like this for long
One day soon we'll look back laughin'
At the week we brought her home
This phase is gonna fly by
So baby just hold on
It wont be like this for long
Four years later bout four thirty
She's crawling in their bed
And when he drops her off at preschool
She's clinging to his leg
The teacher peels her off of him
He says what can I do
She says now don't you worry
This will only last a week or two
It wont be like this for long
One day soon we'll look back laughin'
At the week we brought her home
This phase is gonna fly by
So baby just hold on
It wont be like this for long <start> What a beautiful thought I am thinking concerning the great speckled bird
And to know that my name is recorded on the pages of God's holy word
Desiring to lower her standards they watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teaching but really she makes no mistakes
I am glad I have learned of her meekness I am glad that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing the face of my Savior to look
And when he come up descending from heaven on a cloud like he said in his word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet him on the wings of the great speckled bird <start> They said your cheating heart will make me cry
And like a fool I gave it a try
I should've listened when they told me so
Many many tears ago
But I could not believe the things they said
Because my heart over ruled my head
I should've listened when they told me so
Many many tears ago
I laughed out loud when they told me
That you had someone else
But your cheating heart has shown me
That I was foolin' myself
I know it's too late for a brand new start
For I have cried you out of my heart
I should've listened when they told me so
Many many tears ago
I laughed out loud when they told me
That you had someone else
But your cheating heart has shown me
That I was foolin' myself
I know it's too late for a brand new start
For I have cried you out of my heart
I should've listened when they told me so
I should've listened when they told me so
Many many tears ago <start> I'm always on the road
You're always all alone
And I'm not always there when I'm at home
But I'm ready for a little change
I'm ready to accept some blame
So let's back up to yesterday
Let's get back in love
Back to dreamin' of
All those little things we used to do
Let's start holdin' hands
Let's start makin' plans
Honey let's get back to me and you
It's not like it was
When we fell in love
When all we had was enough
Well I don't like the blues
I like love that's true
Honey let's get back to me and you
Let's get back in love
Back to dreamin' of
All those little things we used to do
Let's start holdin' hands
Let's start makin' plans
Honey let's get back to me and you
Well honey let's get on back to me and you <start> Come here to me my little chickadee
'Cause I think it's time you knew
That you're the kinda gal I've had in mind
And I wanna play house with you
Bought the ring took care of everything
And I'm ready to say I do
You'll be the Mama and I'll be the Papa
'Cause I wanna play house with you
I never thought I'd ever would get caught
By a gal who's five feet two
But it's a cinch I love you every inch
And I wanna play house with you
When you kiss me I'm like a kid of three
But my baby days are through
I'll build a bungalow that'll go to show
I wanna play house with you
The other gals want to marry me
But you just say what for
I'm confessin' that you've got me guessin'
And it only makes me love you more
You never let me kiss you more than once
You're drivin' me wild it's true
I know you're teasin' and that just the reason
Why I wanna play house with you
I never felt like playin' house before
But baby now I do
I'll pay the bills if you'll provide the thrills
'Cause I wanna play house with you
Bought the ring took care of everything
So give me kissin' too
You be the Mama and I'll be the Papa
'Cause I wanna play house with you <start> Look at me and tell me you don't love me
Take my hand and say it can't be
Kiss me once and just before you walk away
Listen first what your senses say
Chorus
I can see me loving you forever
I can feel my arms around your life
I can taste your lips against my memory
Listen to your senses
And what they have to say
Love can hurt love can scar you
The time is best to turn away
But love can heal and love can save you
Today is not like yesterday
Chorus x
Listen to your senses
And what they have to say
I can see me loving you forever. <start> Down in the valley while on my knees
I asked my Jesus carry please
He promised that He'd take care of me
If I would lift Him up
He said if I be lifted up
He said if I be lifted up
I 'll be your father I'll be your mother
I'll be your sister and your brother
He said if I be lifted up
I'll bring joy joy joy to your soul
When I am lonely when I am sad
My Jesus comes and makes me glad
He is the dearest friend I've have had
I want to lift Him up
He said if I be lifted up
He said if I be lifted up
I 'll be your father I'll be your mother
I'll be your sister and your brother
He said if I be lifted up
I'll bring joy joy joy to your soul <start> Don't be angry at me darling if I fail to understand
All your little whims and wishes all the time
Just remember that I'm dumb I guess like any foolish man
And my head stays sorta foggy cause you're mine
Well I recall the first time that I flirted with you dear
When I jokingly said come and be my bride
Now that time has turned the pages it's the sweetest joke on earth
That I have you here forever by my side
Maybe someday you're gonna hurt me well I've been hurting of before
Only God can know and time alone will tell
But in the mean time I'll keep loving you with all my heart and soul
And pray God to let it last if it's his will
Don't be angry at me darling... <start> Everything's Okay 
You think you think you think too much
But it's not about when it's all about what
If you use your eyes and forsake your touch
You might hit for average but you'll choke in the clutch
You wonder you wonder wonderful things
So far beyond your reasoning
You throw back your head you start to sing
But you catch yourself you get your bearings why did you need your bearings
You believe believe belief's beyond you
Belief belongs to the blessed few
You divine water and hope and the blues
But it don't mean much when it don't ring true
You worry you worry words won't work
When winged wonders wonder what you're worth
You have strong suspicions and you'd like to be sure
If words make you sick there must be a cure why don't you take the cure
Hey everything's okay
Put those other thoughts away
Let me hear you say at least for today
Everything's okay

You've seen you've seen scenes so serene
Like red makes you rage but you sleep to green
And you try to determine what it could mean
That it's full and rich but pure and lean
And you sigh size up your surroundings
See the colors and all that they bring
You try to choose from all the offerings
You get right rooted thinking of your bearings but then you start to sing
If you want to improve
Get your mind into a groove
And let it play
All that you have to do
Is get your mind into that groove
And try to keep it that way <start> I've spent my life looking for you
Finding my way wasn't easy to do
but I knew there was you all the while
And it's been worth every mile
Chorus
So lay down beside me
Love me and hide me
Kiss all the hurtin' of this world away
Hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat
And don't ever wander away
Mornings and evenings all were the same
And there was no music till I heard your name
But I knew when I saw you smile
Now I can rest for awhile <start> The east bound train was crowded one cold December day
The conductor shouted Tickets in his old time fashioned way
A little girl in sadness  her hair as bright as gold
She said<  I have no ticket and then her story told
My father he's in prison he's lost his sight they say
I'm going to beg his pardon this cold December day
 ac.guitar 
My mother's daily sewing to try to earn our bread
My poor dear old blind father in prison almost dead
My brother and my sister would both be mighty glad
If I could only bring back my poor dear  old blind Dad
The conductor could not answer he could not make a reply
While looking at this little one he brushed a teardrop from his eye
Do not fear my little one just stay right where you are
You'll never need a ticket while I am on this car <start> I saddled me a wounded priest
Rode him wet through this august heat
I took me a german bride
All empty and bloody inside
In the dark I heard a thief
He stole my money and my grief
In the morning I wanted to die
The doctor cut me the lawyer lied
Stop yer waiting and just go
Don't be saying what you don't know
For the lowlands I am bound
Where my pale bride will be found <start> Once I made a promise that I'd never do no wrong
But I feel the yearn to love you even though I know it's wrong
You'll have to take my hand and lead me slowly through the door
I'll be wrong in what I'm doin' but I can't refuse anymore
Lead me on and take control of how I feel
I can't do this on my own it's against my will
I need love warm and tender in a way I've never known
If you want me I'll go with you but you'll have to lead me on
Lead me on and take control
If you want me I'll go with you but you'll have to lead me on <start> Well I've done it every way they say it oughta be done
But if I can't be me well it ain't much fun
So I bowed out said I gotta go
Gotta crank it on up I got to free my soul
So it's back to my roots an' startin' today
I'm ready to rock in a country kinda way
Ready to rock all night long
Yeah ready to rock 'til the cows come home
Well it's the same ol' me so don't be afraid
I'm just ready to rock in a country kinda way
This time I got a guitar that you gotta plug in
An' a stack of screamin' amps twisted way past ten
I'm havin' a ball an' to tell you the truth
I'm back to makin' music like I always do
I got Conway Jones flowin' through my veins
An' I'm ready rock in a country kinda way
Ready to rock all night long
Yeah ready to rock 'til the cows come home
Well it's the same ol' me so don't be afraid
I'm just ready to rock in a country kinda way
Hey I don't think ol' Hank'd mind
If I done it this way
Ready to rock in a country kinda way
Ready to rock all night long
Yeah I'm ready to rock 'til the cows come home
Hey it's the same ol' me so don't be afraid
I'm just aready to rock yeah I'm ready to rock
I'm ready to rock rock rock rock
In a country kinda way
Now ain't that pretty     <start> I'm out here everyday breakin' haerts along the way
I cause ears to fall and some to lose it all
This whole world would be
Better off without me
Well I'm the saddest words you've spoken
I'm a promise broken
I'm the ballgame that you missed
I'm the calls that don't come in
I'm every poor excuse you use to cover up the truth
I tell the people that you love
That they don't matter quite enough
There's no stoppin' me once I'm in motion
I'm a promise broken
Disappointment disillusion
Despair confusion
I've seen it all in their eyes
Don't promise you will if you won't
Don't say you do if you don't
Its alright to say you'll try
Well I get pushed aside when you move on with your life
But I'll stand the test of time in your heart and in your mind
You'll think about me now and then
Wonder how your life might've been
But I will leave you never knowin'
Well I'm a promise broken
I'm a promise broken <start> Just a bunch of poor boys daddy's girls
children of the corn field
tryin turn a shift job into a dollar bill
We wear the muddy boots
Stay true to how we're raised
A'int nothin bout us fake
You know we're straight out of that dirty south dirty roads
nobody got no money
got them signed up pickup trucks
whistlin at them honies
from the country 
you know we're straight out of that long week workin
now everybody wanna party
all night long bonfire on the back 
in the middle of nowhere
ain't nobody leaving here
till we're straight out of cold beer

You know we're straight out of that dirty south dirty roads
nobody got no money
got them signed up pickup trucks
whistlin at them honies
from the country 
you know we're straight out of that long week workin
now everybody wanna party
all night long bonfire on the back 
in the middle of nowhere
ain't nobody leaving here
till we're straight out of cold beer
straight out of cold beer <start> I've been down on my luck
I've been shadowed with trouble and sorrow.
But I ain't givin' up'
'Cause I know there is always tomorrow.
There are no guarantees
Life is always a hit or miss.
But I truly believe
I won't always be feeling' like this.
I'm gonna shine like the sun
When these clouds roll away from my door.
When it's all said and done
I won't be at your mercy no more.
I will prove my own worth
Heal the damage and hurt that's been done.
And when the cryin's all done.
Well I'm gonna shine like the sun.
I've been thinking here lately
What all I can do to improve.
Though I've suffered greatly
I know just what I have to do.
I have to move forward
Cut losses break loose and move on.
And I have to swim shoreward
Lest I should drown out here alone.
I'm gonna shine like the sun
When these clouds roll away from my door.
I won't crawl I can run
I'll be at no ones mercy no more.
I'll be swinging on sunbeams
So proud that I finally won.
And when the losin's all done.
Well I'm gonna shine like the sun.
I'm gonna shine I'm gonna shine.
I'm gonna shine like the sun.
When these clouds roll away from my door.
And when it's all said and done
I won't be at your mercy no more.
I'll be off chasin' rainbows
Rejoicin' and havin' my fun.
And when the cryin's all done
Well I'm gonna shine like the sun.
When the cryin's all done
When the tryin's all done
When the lyin's all done
There'll be nothin' but sun.
When it's all said and done
Well I'm gonna shine like the sun.
Shine like the sun shine like the sun. <start> I want him but he don't want me
He wants somebody else that I can't be
And she's got a man that she wants to leave
'Cause he can't seem to make her happy
Does it have to be wrong to make it feel right
Tell me why ain't nobody satisfied
Old man lookin' a photograph
Of a love that's long gone from his past
And his wife's got a letter that she can't read
From a boy who never came back from the sea
All these secrets or lies we keep deep inside
Does it have to be wrong to make it feel right
Tell me why there ain't nobody satisfied Yeah
See that man walkin' down the street
Yeah what arethe odds he's the one for me
An' what if I pass him by an' he's got the love I need
Yeah yeah yeah
Tell me why there ain't nobody satisfied
I want him but he don't want me
He wants somebody else that I can't be
And she's got a man that she wants to leave
'Cause he can't seem to make her happy
See that man walkin' down the street
Yeah what arethe odds he's the one for me
An' what if I pass him by an' he's got the love I need <start> I'M NOT THAT GOOD AT GOODBYE

I don't want to talk it over one more time
No there's not much use in talkin'. If you've made up your mind
And darlin' I don't need to tell you why
You know that I'm not that good at goodbye
Please don't tell me you're leavin' if you go
Just let me turn my head while you walk out the door
'Cause if I see you leavin' I will die
You know that I'm not that good at goodbye
Lord goodbyes just make it harder anyhow
So if you really feel like leavin' do it now
And let me keep a little of my pride
You know that I'm not that good at goodbye
I don't want to know you're leavin' when you go
'Cause if we reach the part where you're standin' at the door
Well I know I'd just break down again and cry
You know that I'm not that good at goodbye <start> That night will live forever
Their first time to lie together
They were finally where desire dared them to go
Both belonging to another
But longing to be lovers
Promising each other that the night will only know
Parked on some old backstreet
They laid down in the back seat
And fell into the fire down below
But they would pay for their deceiving
For a deadly web was weaving
Why they picked that spot that evening
Lord the night will only know
Well within the innuendos
Just outside the steamy windows
The night was shattered by a woman's scream
Motionless and frightened
The grip of fate had tightened
And with trembling hands they wiped away the steam
They saw a woman pleading
Stumbling begging and retreating'
Til she became the victim of her foe
And they watched her fall in silence
To save their own alliance
But the reason for the violence
Just the night will only know
And every paper ran the story
She was stripped of all her glory
And the told exactly how the woman died
Abandoned and forsaken
Too many pills were taken
And they ruled the woman's death a suicide
Bound by their behavior
They could have been her savior
Now guilt becomes the endless debt they owe
But another crime was committed
And it's never been admitted
Have the guilty been acquitted
Lord the night will only know <start> I've laid around and played around this old town too long
Summer's almost gone yes winter's comin' on
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
Papa writes to Johnny but Johnny can't come home
Johnny can't come home no Johnny can't come home
Papa writes to Johnny but Johnny can't come home
Cause he's been on this chain gang too long
I've laid around and played around...
High sheriff and police ridin' after me
Ridin' after me yes they're comin' after me
High sheriff and police ridin' after me
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
Want to see my honey want to see her bad
Want to see her bad oh want to see her bad
Want to see my honey want to see her bad
She's the best gal this poor boy ever had
I've laid around and played around...
And I feel like I've gotta travel on <start> 
It's a dirty job
But somebody's got to do it
Better get to it
Somebody's gotta do it
Whatever it takes whatever it takes
Any work at all
Is better than none
Better buckle down to it
Gotta get the job done
Gotta earn my pay... I gotta earn my pay
I can't wait around on the lottery
And there ain't no millionaires
Lookin' for me
And somebody's gotta do it do it
Somebody's gotta do it do it
Somebody's gotta do it do it
Somebody
I can think of better things
I'd rather do
I might get lucky
And I'm hopin' to
But until I do
I gotta compromise
The job ain't much
But at least it's mine
It beats standin'
In the unemployment line
Put pride aside
And I'll improvise
Even if I do get a better job
Somebody else
Has gotta fill my spot
Somebody's gotta do it do it
Somebody's gotta do it do it
Somebody's gotta do it do it
Somebody
Somebody
Somebody's gotta do it do it
Somebody's gotta do it do it
It's a dirty job
It's a lowdown dirty job
Somebody
Even if the rules are too hard to follow
Even when pride is too hard to swallow
It's another day so it's another dollar
That's what it's all about Oh
It's a dirty job
But somebody's got to do it
Better get to it
Somebody's gotta do it
Whatever it takes
Gotta keep the faith
Any work at all
Is better than none
Better buckle down to it
Gotta get the job done
Gotta earn my way
And it's a workin' day
The job ain't much
But at least it's mine
It beats standin'
In the unemployment line
Somebody's gotta do it do it
Somebody's gotta do it do it
Somebody's gotta do it do it
Somebody
Somebody
It's a dirty job
Somebody's gotta do this lowdown dirty job
Somebody
It's a dirty job it's a dirty job
It's a lowdown dirty job
Somebody
Somebody
Somebody <start> I was forced to pay a bride's price
I couldn't look the other way.
She hooked me with her fuck me eyes
They still haunt me to this day.
She says only you can know these secrets
Buried deep beneath my skin only your tongue
Can uncover them.
Yeah yeah yeah yeaaah
Yeah yeah yeah yeaaah
In a room as cold as Winter
I explored her with my hands.
She said darling you must forgive in order to understand.
Yeah yeah yeah yeaaah
Yeah yeah yeah yeaaah
My breathe it slowly left me
I snaked my way inside.
The next thing that I knew
You were not lying by my side.
Yeah yeah yeah yeaaah
Yeah yeah yeah yeaaah
In the end we find a single door
And all the things we should have done.
Piled high on all the surfaces
Fears excuses given.
Yeah yeah yeah yeaaah
Yeah yeah yeah yeaaah <start> In a lonely room waiting for the night to fall
I hear your voice in every whippoorwill that calls
And it takes me back to a better place and a sweeter time
When I was your's and you were mine
As the shadows fall and the light grows dim I see your face
I close my eyes and feel the warmth of your embrace
As I long for you and for all those days when hearts entwined
When I was your's and you were mine
When I was your's and you were mine
When I was your's and you were mine a truer love in Caroline
Ever waltzed across these hills and danced beneath the stars
Life was sweeter than the flowers blooming on the vine
When I was your's and you were mine
So I lay my head on a pillow soft and stained with tears
I cry for you through all the long and lonely years
But when I dream till the morning sun comes to shine
Then I'll be your's and you'll be mine <start> Yes more to me than anything else I've ever known
More to me than anything else I'm ever gonna see
Just your love is all that I need to depend upon
And each day that passes by you're more to me
When I'm gone away thoughts of you keep a runnin' through my mind
Like a sunny day I can feel your warm sweet love light shinin' all over me
Till I'm back in your arms again
And every time I find the feelin's stronger than it's ever been
Yes more to me...
Til my life is through you're the one that I'll be livin' for
Every day with you I just seem to need you even more
And I want to say that I never thought I'd see
Anyone like you who cares so much for someone else like me
Cause more to me...
And each day that passes by you're more to me <start> Ah now I don't hardly know her
But I think I could love her
Crimson and clover
Ah when she comes walking over
Now I've been waitin' to show her
Crimson and clover over and over
Yeah my my such a sweet thing
I wanna do everything
What a beautiful feeling
Crimson and clover over and over
Crimson and clover over and over
Crimson and clover over and over
Crimson and clover over and over
Crimson and clover over and over <start> 
Chorus
Oh on a highway headed south somewhere to Dixie
Where the cotton blooms in the spring and the snow don't fly
I'm gonna rest these chillin' bones in the Southern sunshine
And live where the weather's warm until I die
North Dakota you got my better years
Montana you got five years of my life
But the earth's subzero wind will never touch me again
A Southern girl can't live on snow and ice
Repeat Chorus
When I cross the Dixie line I'll throw away my coat
And my goosedown underwear will have to go
I'll never live again where the weather chills you to the bone
I'm tired of livin' like an Eskimo
Repeat Chorus
On a highway headed south somewhere to Dixie
Where the cotton blooms in the spring and the snow don't fly
I'm gonna rest these willin' bones in the Southern sunshine
And live where the weather's warm until I die
Repeat Chorus  Fade <start> 
Blue me blue me
Blue is the color
That fits best on me
I'm blue
Just as blue as can be
Blue me Blue me
I cry
And I die
I lie awake at night
And I question why
Must it be
I can never be free
Blue me Blue me
My heart is heavy
But it's empty inside
No one to love me
Or to lay down beside
I'm blue
The queen of sorrow
Wears royal blue
My luck ain't changin'
Is it ever goin' to
I'm blue Oh I'm blue
Why must I wear this robe of blue misery
Blue me Blue me
Ooh
This sad old feeling
Is breakin' me down
No satisfaction with these blues hangin' 'round
Lord I'm blue
Oh I'm so blue Why can't I shake it tell me where will this end
When will I get out of this blue rut I'm in
Oh I'm blue
Looks like the blues just took a liking to me
Blue me Blue me Blue me Blue me
Blue is the color that fits best on me
Ooooh I'm blue
I'm just as blue as can be
Blue me
Blue me <start> Hey maybe I'll dye my hair
Maybe I'll move somewhere
Maybe I'll get a car
Maybe I'll drive so far
They'll all lose track
Me I'll bounce right back
Maybe I'll sleep real late
Maybe I'll lose some weight
Maybe I'll clear my junk
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine
Me I'll be just
Fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let sorrow bring me way down
Hey maybe I'll learn to sew
Maybe I'll just lie low
Maybe I'll hit the bars
Maybe I'll count the stars until dawn
Me I will go on
Maybe I'll settle down
Maybe I'll just leave town
Maybe I'll have some fun
Maybe I'll meet someone and make him mine
Me I'll be just
Fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let sorrow bring me way down
'Cause I'll be fine ooh <start> We cut the cake everybody danced
And some people drank too much
You looked like the cover of Brides magazine
And I looked like some guy in a tux
I'll never forget when your Uncle Bill
Pulled up a chair and sat down
He said son I've been married now
Forty five years and pointed at you through the crowd
And said
Love her like she's leaving
Like it's all going to end if you don't
Love her like she's leaving
Oh and I guarantee she won't
He said it's sending her flowers for no reason
At all and notes on the fridge every day
An unexpected gift at an unexpected time
That keeps the lawyers away
And it's easy to take forever for granted
With tin cans tied to your car
And I know she tells you that she'll always be there
But I'm telling you if you're smart
You'll love her like she's leaving
Like it's all going to end if you don't
Love her like she's leaving
Oh and I guarantee she won't
She could have any man she wants you know it's true
Best way to keep her is to keep her wanting you
Love her like she's leaving
Oh and I guarantee she won't
Yeah I guarantee she won't
Love her like she's leaving
Oh and I guarantee she won't <start> Well I never did crawl and I never did toe the line
No man is a master to me I ain't that kind
I just put on my travelin' shoes
If you want to win you just can't lose the time
Or stay behind
Well I was born to run
To get ahead of the rest
And all that I wanted was to be the best
Just to feel free and be someone
I was born to be fast I was born to run
Well I take the chances sometime I made mistakes
But you don't get nothin' unless you take the breaks
Livin' as dangerous as dynamite
Sure it makes you feel nervous but it makes you feel alright
Makes you feel alright
Well I was born to run
To get ahead of the rest
And all that I wanted was to be the best
Just to feel free and be someone
I was born to be fast I was born to run
Nobody gonna make me do things their way
By the time you figure it out it's yesterday
Well it comes to he who waits I'm told
But I don't need it when I'm old and gray
Yeah I want it today
Well I was born to run
To get ahead of the rest
And all that I wanted was to be the best
Just to feel free and be someone
I was born to be fast I was born to run
I was born to run
To get ahead of the rest
And all that I wanted was to be the best
Just to feel free and be someone
I was born to be fast I was born to run <start> Spring the jester leaps to my eyes
And with both hands full of surprise he brings
Joy and the whole world sings
But I'm still blue

Summer with his lazy smile
Warms my broken heart for a while it seems
Him and his sunshine dreams
But I'm still blue

CHORUS
Happiness is only a memory
For you left me blue
Took the rest of the rainbow from me

Autumn with an artist's hand
Leaves his mark all over the land with bold
Strokes of burnished gold
But I'm still blue

REPEAT CHORUS
Winter comes and tightens her grip
One more year lies waiting to slip away
Like a ship on a fog bound bay
But I'm still blue
But I'm still blue <start> I can see the sunshine again
And I can see the blue sky where there once was fog and rain
We know each other now clear through and through
The fog has lifted between me and you
I loved you the first time I saw you
For it seemed like I had known you all my life
Well I loved you too but it takes a long time
To know what hurts you what helps you and know how you feel deep inside
I'm so happy you found out before it was too late
Our beautiful love could have turned into hate
Forgiving and understanding gives us a clear view
The fog has lifted between me and you
Now there's the sunshine again... <start> Baby's in the cradle mama's in the bed
Sparrow's on the windowsill and the devil's in my head
Devil's in my head mama the devil's in my head
Baby's in the cradle and the devil's in my head
When the winter yields to summertime
The whippoorwill she sings
My heart is in the puppet box and Satan pulls the strings
Satan pulls the strings mama Satan pulls the strings
My heart is in the puppet box and Satan pulls the strings
Well the front beat's in my brother Lord
And the black beat's in me
God is in the song and the devil's in my feet
My God devil's in our feet mama the devil's in our feet
God is in the song and the devil's in our feet
Mama's cooking something up serving to us all
Satan's ringing in now and I gotta take the call
Gotta take the call boys gotta take the call
Satan's ringing in now and I gotta take the call <start> Hang your head Tom Dooley
Hang your head and cry
You killed poor Laurie Foster
And you know you're bound to die.
You left her by the roadside
Where you begged to be excused
You left her by the roadside
Then you hid her clothes and shoes.
Hang your head Tom Dooley
Hang your head and cry
You killed poor Laurie Foster
And you know you're bound to die.
You took her on the hillside
For to make her your wife
You took her on the hillside
And there you took her life.
You dug the grave four feet long
And you dug it three feet deep
You rolled the cold clay over her
And tromped it with your feet.
Hang your head Tom Dooley
Hang your head and cry
You killed poor Laurie Foster
And you know you're bound to die.
Trouble oh it's trouble
Arollin' through my breast
As long as I'm alivin' boys
They ain't agonna let me rest.
I know they're gonna hang me
Tomorrow I'll be dead
Though I never even harmed a hair
On poor little Laurie's head.
Hang your head Tom Dooley
Hang your head and cry
You killed poor Laurie Foster
And you know you're bound to die.
In this world and one more
Then reckon where I'll be
If is wasn't for Sheriff Grayson
I'd be in Tennessee.
You can take down my old violin
And play it all you please.
For at this time tomorrow boys
It'll be of no use to me.
Hang your head Tom Dooley
Hang your head and cry
You killed poor Laurie Foster
And you know you're bound to die.
At this time tomorrow
Where do you reckon I'll be
Away down yonder in the holler
Hangin' on a white oak tree.
Hang your head Tom Dooley
Hang your head and cry
You killed poor Laurie Foster
And you know you're bound to die <start> Parody of Cadillac Style by Sammy Kershaw  Ray Stevens Music .
New lyrics by Cledus T. Judd Billy Lawson and Mike Curtis LaPo Music Sony ATVCross Keys Music Michael Everett Curtis Publishing 
Well she won't wear her contacts she won't wear glasses
So she can't see me while I'm makin' passes
And every time she tries to kiss me she misses by a mile
Because my little baby loves me cadirac style
I remember the first night we started datin'
Both of her pupils were dilatin'
And in the back of my Lincoln we got a little wild
Oh my little baby loves me cadirac style
Well she don't care if the lights are on or off
As long as I watch so we don't get caught
''cause what we're doin' we could be fined
And the law don't care true love is blind
Well she wrecked my new Honda in Panima City
Slung her through the windshield now she ain't so purdy
And though she's missin' all her teeth she's still got a cute smile
Oh my lttle baby loves me cadirac style
Well she don't care if the lights are on or off
As long as I watch so we don't get caught
'Cause what we're doin' we could be fined
And the law don't care if true love is blind
Well she says one day she's gonna get me to the altar
Swears up and down I look like Clay Walker
And when I try to tell her different she gets a little riled
Oh my little baby loves me cadirac style
Because my little baby loves me cadirac style
Oh no my little baby loves me cadirac style
She thinks I look like David Hasselhoff.
There's you're glasses on.
OOPS
She just stepped on 'em. <start> If you love me half as much as I love you
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
You're nice to me when there's no one else around
You only build me up to let me down
If you missed me half as much as I miss you
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
I know that I would never feel so blue
If you only loved me half as much as I love you
If you love me half as much as I love you
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
You're nice to me when there's no one else around
You only build me up to let me down
If you missed me half as much as I miss you
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
I know that I would never feel so blue
If you only loved me half as much as I love you <start> Hey mama when you leave
Don't leave a thing behind
I don't want nothin'
I can't use nothin'
Take care into the hall
And if you see my friends
Tell them I'm fine
Not using nothin'
Almost burned out my eyes
Threw my ears down to the floor
I didn't see nothin'
I didn't hear nothin'
I stood there like a block of stone
Knowin' all I had to know
And nothin' more
Man that's nothin'
As brothers our troubles are
Locked in each others arms
And you better pray
They never find you
Your back ain't strong enough
For burdens double fold
They'd crush you down
Down into nothin'
Being born is going blind
And buying down a thousand times
To echoes strung
On pure temptation
Sorrow and solitude
These are the precious things
And the only words
That are worth rememberin' <start> Ooh
Baby last night was hands down
One of the best nights
That I've had no doubt
Between the bottle of wine
And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern lights
If I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man oh yes I could
Baby that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You're a saint you're a goddess the cutest the hottest the masterpiece
It's too good to be true nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
What I need in this life is your crazy love
I don't need no vacation no fancy destination
You're my great escape
We could stay at home listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace
If I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man
Baby I could die a happy man
Oh I could die a happy man
Ooh 
Baby I could die a happy man <start> I pack my clothes in a cardboard box and mama packed my lunch
I walk down to the highway and caught a trailways bus
I woke up in the city stepped down on the curb
To the strangest lookin' people and sounds I've never heard
It ain't no place for a country boy it ain't no place to be
It might be fine for a city boy but it ain't no place for me
I keep my nineteen dollars stuck way down in my shoe
It cost me seven fifty for a dirty sleepin' room
My window faced the alley and the city smells were strong
I couldn't sleep for horns and sirens blowin' all night long
It ain't no place for a country boy it ain't no place to be
It might be fine for a city boy but it ain't no place for me
I didn't even bother to unpack the clothes that I brought
Some man paid me ten dollars for grandpa's pocket watch
I got off the trailways bus the same place I got on
My head is full of memories walkin' down the road to home
It ain't no place for a country boy it ain't no place to be
It might be fine for a city boy but it ain't no place for me
It ain't no place for a country boy it ain't no place to be
It might be fine for a city boy but it ain't no place for me <start> The best of friends the best of lovers
That's what we used to be
I just wish we'd ended up the way we started out
From one little room where we loved each other
To this big two story house
We wanted the best I'm afraid that's what we've got now
We're the best of strangers

No one could do it any better
We live here separately together
We're the best of strangers

We share a ceiling and a floor
But there's no feeling anymore
We're the best of strangers
We go to bed we turn out the light
We stare at different walls
And most of the time we don't even say goodnight
I don't touch you you don't touch me
Except passing in the hall
And then when we do we both apologize
We're the best of strangers

No one could do it any better
We live here separately together
We're the best of strangers

We share a ceiling and a floor
But there's no feeling anymore
We're the best of strangers
We're the best of strangers
We're the best of strangers <start> It's a marshmallow world in the winter
When the snow comes to cover the ground
It's the time for play it's a whipped cream day
I wait for it the whole year round
Those are marshmallow clouds being friendly
In the arms of the evergreen trees
And the sun is red like a pumpkin head
It's shining so your nose won't freeze
All the world is your snowball see how it grows
That's how it goes whenever it snows
The world is your snowball just for a song
So get out and push it along
It's a yumyummy world made for sweethearts
Take a walk with your favorite girl
It's a sugar date what if spring is late
In winter it's a marshmallow world
Yeah it's the time for play it's a whipped cream day
I wait for it the whole year round
And the sun is red like a pumpkin head
It's shining so your nose won't freeze
All the world is your snowball see how it grows
That's how it goes whenever it snows
The world is your snowball just for a song
So get out and roll it along
It's a yumyummy world made for sweethearts
Take a walk with your favorite girl
You're my sugar date what if spring is late
In winter it's a marshmallow world
In winter it's a marshmallow world <start> I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
Oh I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases
All your Christmases
May all your Christmases be white <start> There's a ship out on the ocean at the mercy of the sea
It's been tossed about lost and broken wandering aimlessly
And God somehow you know that ship is me
'Cause there's a light house in a harbor shining faithfully
Pouring its life out across the water for this sinking soul in the sea
That someone out there still believes in me
On a prayer in a song I hear your voice and it keeps me hanging on
Oh raining down against the wind I'm reaching out
'Til we reach the circle's end when you come back to me again
There's a moment that we all come to in our own time in our space
For all that we've done we can undo if our heart's in the right place
On a prayer in a song I hear your voice and it keeps me hanging on
Oh raining down against the wind I'm reaching out
'Til we reach the circle's end when you come back to me again
And again I see my yesterdays in front of me unfolding like a mystery
Your changing all that is and used to be
On a prayer in a song I hear your voice and it keeps me hanging on
Oh raining down against the wind I'm reaching out
'Til we reach the circle's end when you come back to me again
When you come back to me again <start> Smoky old bars bright neon lights
Good ole boys and girls of the night
An ice cold beer and a good shot of brandy
I've always had a sweet tooth
For the devil's candy
And I've fought it all my life
And the battle's now a war
But I'll get up tomorrow
And I'll fight it all once more
I want to do what's right
But I'll never understand me
I've always had a sweet tooth
For the devil's candy
Well I've played the cards and I've rolled the dice
Well I gave up heaven for a fool's paradise
I once lost an angel when a bad girl was handy
I've always had a sweet tooth
For the devil's candy
And I've fought it all my life
And the battle's now a war
But I'll get up tomorrow
And I'll fight it all once more
I want to do what's right
But I'll never understand me
I've always had a sweet tooth
For the devil's candy <start> Old school McGraw coming out of my doors
Had to pull over couldn't take it no more
Got this thing running in park hazards lighting up the dark
I was just out driving around wast scanning for a memory to slow me down
But damn if yours didn't baby
I'd'a paid that DJ not to play it
'Cause I'm sitting here knowing what it's gonna take to fix me
It ain't a bar ain't the beer it ain't the whiskey
I'd give anything to hear ya say ya miss me tonight
Yeah anybody else with any kind of sense
Woulda done moved on said it is what it is
But I'm off on the shoulder in a mess all wrecked inside
Baby I'm broke down and it ain't the truck this time
People slowing down wanna see what's wrong
I got my hand out the window just waving 'em on
'Cause I don't wanna have to explain
Don't want know one to see me this way
Don't need no gas don't need no ride
Everything on this Chevy is running just fine
I just need another minute or two
'Til this songs over like me and you
I'm sitting here knowing what it's gonna take to fix me
It ain't a bar ain't the beer it ain't the whiskey
I'd give anything to hear ya say you miss me tonight
Yeah anybody else with any kind of sense
Woulda done moved on said it is what it is
But I'm off on the shoulder in a mess all wrecked inside
Yeah baby I'm broke down and it ain't the truck this time
Yeah anybody else with any kind of sense
Woulda done moved on but I'm here like this
Off on the shoulder in a mess all wrecked inside
Yeah baby I'm broke down but it ain't the truck this time
No it ain't the truck this time
I got nowhere to go nowhere to be
I'm nobody baby if you don't love me <start> 
You kissed me and you said I was a gentleman to you
You said I was a person you could trust
You told me that you love me in a way that couldn't die
Girl you sure know how to say goodbye
You kissed me in a way you never did when love was right
Girl you sure know how to say goodbye
I stood and watched you walk away and I didn't even cry
Girl you sure know how to say goodbye
You gave me that old pep talk as you cried on my sleeve
You said that you'd come running day or night
You said that I could call on you throughout my lonely life
Girl you sure know how to say goodbye
You kissed me in a way <start> I saw you dancing through the window
Saw you dancing to the band and it's me
I saw you messing around with an old friend
You said you didn't even see
Saw you walk on through the doorway
Saw you walking hand in hand
Saw him touching you the way lovers do
And now it won't happen again
Well you I think you know what I mean
That I'm not gonna stand around and play make believe
Darling if you love me tell me baby
Was it I the one in your world who took everything that was upside down
And put it right side up for you
When you close that door behind you
I'll carry on feeling no regrets
I'll carry the image of you and all you put me through
I'm not gonna get it out of my head
Well you I think you know what I mean
That I am not gonna stand around and play make believe
Well you I think you know what I mean
That I am not gonna stay around and play make believe <start> Never call your name
I just whisper
And never blue is my skin
I just missed up.
Tell me a promise never
Tell me that success was your reason for concern.
And never curse your name
I just choke
Never cut no corners
I just hope.
And tell me that our time was not spent in vain
Tell me I can sop it up and save it from the dream.
Chorus
Living was made of mirrors
Darling help for cause left in all you sinners
And TV stations is always wrong
The coffee never taste too long
I'm moving on
I give my regards
To the main
The unknown face.
Left to ..
In case you're sure of
The cuttin' credit cards and try to blow up
Tell me that our time was not spent in vain
Tell me I can sop it up and save it from the dream.
Chorus x
Living was made of mirrors
Darling help for cause left in all you sinners
And TV stations is always wrong
The coffee never taste too long
I'm moving on
I give my regards
To the main
The unknown face. <start> Don't be angry with me darling if I fail to understand
All your little whims and wishes all the time
Just remember that I'm dumb I guess like any foolish man
And my head stays sorta foggy cause you're mine
Well I recall the first time that I flirted with you dear
When I jokingly said come and be my bride
Now that time has turned the pages it's the sweetest joke on earth
That I have you dear forever by my side
 steel 
Maybe someday you're gonna hurt me I've been hurt in love before
Only God can know and time alone will tell
But in the mean time I'll keep loving you with all my heart and soul
And pray God to let it last if it's his will
So don't be angry with me darling if I fail to understand
All your little whims and wishes all the time
Just remember that I'm dumb I guess like any foolish man
And my head stays sorta foggy cause you're mine <start> Each day I'll do 
A golden deed 
By helping those 
Who are in need 
My life on earth 
Is but a span 
And so I'll do 
CHORUS
Life's evening sun 
Is sinking low 
A few more days 
And I must go 
Too meet the deed 
That I have done 
Where there will be 
While traveling down 
Life's weary road 
I'll try to lessen 
Some travelers load 
I'll try to turn 
The nights to day 
Make flowers bloom 
REPEAT CHORUS <start> If she brings you happiness
Then I wish you both the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if she ever breaks your heart
If the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
Though it hurts to let you go
Darling I want you to know
I'll run to you if ever you should call
And if I should ever hear
That she's made you shed a tear
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
To dry away each teardrop you've cried
If she ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls
All I Estare Candor me necesites a tu lado
Para borrar cadda lagrima que haya llorado
If he ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls <start> The nights were dark and long
I spent a million all alone
But I never once stopped loving you
My world was cold and still
My dreams lay unfulfilled
But I never once stopped loving you
Chorus
I never once stopped believing we'd love again
The way we used to do
And today when you came back my patience was rewarded
For I never once stopped loving you
I could have loved another
But I chose the way and suffered
For I never once stopped loving you
And I prayed to God to guide you
Till I could be beside you
And I never once stopped loving you
Chorus <start> Cold Fort Worth beer just ain't no good for jealous
I tried it night after night
You're in someone else's arms in Dallas
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind
Darlin' while you're busy burnin' bridges
Burn one for me when you get time
'Cause good memories don't fade so easy
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind
You left me here to be with him in Dallas
And I know it hurt you at the time
I wonder now if it makes a difference
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind
You left me here to be with him in Dallas
And I know it hurt you at the time
I wonder now if it makes a difference
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind <start> Twentyfive minutes past quitting time
Seven of us crammed into that truck of mine
Paying no attention to them highway signs
Doing ninety miles an hour toward the county line
Quick sack twelve pack back again
It's a B double E double are you N.
My buddies and their babies letting down their hair
As long as we're together it don't matter where
Ain't got a lot of money but we just don't care
Knowing half the fun is getting there
Aztec longnecks paychecks spent
oh it's a B double E double are you N.
I can't stop thinking
What the hell they were drinking
When they made this county dry
I got a week long thirst
And to make it worse
Lord it's my turn to drive
Laughing and a bragging and a carrying on
We loaded up the wagons and we headed home
I guess a half a dozen cases doesn't last that long
Come tomorrow morning it'll be all gone
Then it's turn around leave town sounds again
Like a B double E double are you N. <start> Leaving For The Flatlands
Don Williams
Album Flatlands
Sweetly flows the water from the mountain
Softly falls the rain upon the leaves
Gently blows the breeze among the cedars
Quietly my heart is on its knees
How could anything in all creation
Be more beautiful than all I see
With it all my heart is not rejoicing
Because the one I love is not with me
Somewhere in between us was a difference
Not we or all this beauty could secure
And I know now my heart will ache forever
And I wonder if this mountain can endure
So l'm leavin'for the flatlands
Goin' back where I was conceived
Goin' back where nobody knows the difference
This mountain knows too much about me <start> There's a slow moon rising
It's shining on your skin.
And the way about it moves me.
I know there's no holding back no holding back.
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this.
I wouldn't be a man if a woman like you was anything I could resist.
I'd had to be from another planet where love doesn't exist.
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this.
I can feel passion flowing
As you fall into my arms
And the secret way you touch me
I know there's no holding back no holding back.
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this.
I wouldn't be a man if a woman like you was anything I could resist.
I'd had to be from another planet where love doesn't exist.
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like
Rose me baby whole nightlong
Soul to soul baby all night long.
I'd had to be from another planet where love doesn't exist.
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this.
Baby baby please.
Go easy on me.
I wouldn't be a man no <start> Well Hank I never met you but I sure heard you sing
At a little bitty port down in Mississippi you filled my heart with dreams
I got an old guitar and I learned how to sing as you did the Lovesick Blues
So Hank if you're listenin' there's one just for you
There's a little bit of Hank in me
Cause I caught it in my voice of the radio '
And I've done your songs in the cotton fields and on coast to coast TV
And every time I sing KawLiga there's a little bit of Hank in me
 guitar 
Well I'll bet I've done Your Cheatin' Heart at least a million times
And Hank you're still the jukebox king from LA to Caroline
No music has no boundary it comes from the heart
And where my music comes from Hank you play the leading part
There's a little bit of Hank in me...
And every time I sing KawLiga there's a little bit of Hank in me <start> I can chop wood from dusk till dawn
I can swing a hammer till the daylight's gone
I can build a barn I can make a home with these two hands
But if I didn't have all your love I'd be half a man
I can fly planes up in the big blue sky
Blaze a trail though the woods in my four wheel drive
With a team of horses or an old John Deere I can plow this land
But if I didn't have all your love I'd be half a man
I can hang the stars I can rope the moon
Walk across Texas in these cowboy boots
I can run a train when it runs outta track
With the weight of the world laid across my back
But my life still wouldn't be worth a damn
If I didn't have all your love I'd be half a man
I could build a fire usin' nothin' but a stick
If I put my mind to it there ain't much I can't fix
I can read and count I can figure things out if you give me a chance
But if I didn't have all your love I'd be half a man
I can hang the stars I can rope the moon
Walk across Texas in these cowboy boots
I can run a train when it runs outta track
With the weight of the world laid across my back
But my life still wouldn't be worth a damn
If I didn't have all your love I'd be half a man
Now I can hang the stars I can rope the moon
Walk across Texas in these cowboy boots
I can run a train when it runs outta track
With the weight of the world laid across my back
But my life still wouldn't be worth a damn
If I didn't have all your love I'd be half a man
I'd be half a man <start> Love didn't have much to work with
When it got a hold of me
Still recovering from my last time out
Doing my best to learn to live without it
Just when I thought all my feelings had died
Something came over me that can't be denied
don't under estimate the power of love
You're never down so low that it can't lift you up
Don't under estimate what it can do
I'm living proof of the power of love
It didn't hit me like lightening
From a dark and stormy sky
It came on more like a peaceful wind
It made me feel like trying again
I didn't realize how good it could be
Until love worked its magic on me
don't under estimate the power of love
You're never down so low that it can't lift you up
Don't under estimate what it can do
I'm living proof of the power of love <start> You really let yourself go you really gotten all over me
Time has taken it's toll you're not the woman you used to be
And if you ever think of me you ain't letting it show
How it hurts me to see you this way
You really let yourself go
Girl you know it really not like you l've been seeing you round
Hanging out with the good time crowd out painting the town
I've ask our old friends about you and they just turn away
I've taken all that I can and I just have to say
You really let yourself go you really gotten all over me
Time has taken it's toll you're not the woman you used to be
And if you ever think of me you ain't letting it show
How it hurts me to see you this way
You really let yourself go
There are lessons in heartbrake I've learned through the years
Spent many a lonesome night cried many a tear
That it's a doggone slap in the face for every fool on a stool
Girl you oughta be heartbroke you're breaking all of the rules
You really let yourself go you really gotten all over me
Time has taken it's toll you're not the woman you used to be
And if you ever think of me you ain't letting it show
How it hurts me to see you this way
You really let yourself go
How it hurts me to see you this way
You really let yourself go <start> It happens every time I think about the reasons why
I'm sitting here alone at night and not with you.
Heartache takes control and lets me know
Just what a fool I was and how you can't erase the things you do.
And sorry just can't mend a broken heart I've handed you
Break apart is what most broken hearts still you to do.
But I made long long way from over you
Don't think I've ever seen so many shades of blue.
They say the time will heal
Don't know if I ever will
'Cause I'm a long long way from over you.
Now over you the sound like some lost city
People tell me how to find it somehow I just never do
And maybe it's because I never wanted to it all
Of course now I see that I had the best in you.
That clock just runs in circles days just go on by
Memories hold me closer no matter how I cry.
I'm still a long long way from over you
Don't think I've ever seen so many shades of blue.
They say the time will heal
Don't know if I ever will
'Cause I'm a long long way from over you.
That clock just runs in circles days just go on' by
Memories hold me closer no matter how I cry.
I'm still a long long way from over you
Don't think I've ever seen so many shades of blue.
They say the time will heal
Don't know if I ever will
'Cause I'm a long long way from over you
C'mon banjo
How 'bout that mandolin in there
All right flattop
How 'bout of little pedal steel guitar
Little of bass n' drums now
Aw c'mon everybody
They say that time will heal
Don't know if I ever will
'Cause I'm a long long way from over you <start> Oh it's been such a long long time looks like I could get you off my mind
But I can't for just the thought of you turns my world a misty blue
Just the mention of your name turns the flicker to a flame
I think of things that we used to do then my whole world turns misty blue
I should forget you heaven knows I've tried
But when I said I'm glad we're through my heart knows that I've lied
Oh it's been such a long long time looks like I could get you off my mind
But I can't for just the thought of you turns my world a misty blue
Yes just the thought of you turns my world a misty blue <start> Bring me champagne when I'm thirsty
Bring me reefer when I want to get high
Yeah bring me champagne when I'm thirsty
Reefer when I want to get high
Yeah you know when I'm lonely
Bring my lady by my side
Yeah there should be no law
On people that want to smoke a little dop
No there should be no law
On people that want to smoke a little dope
Yeah it's good for your head
And your body don't you know
Everytime I get high I lay my head down on my baby's breast
Yeah I lay down be quiet and tryin' to take my rest
You know she hold me and kiss me she says
You're the man I love the best
I'm gonna get high this morning just as sure as you know my name
I'm gonna get high this morning and it's going to be a cryin' shame
I'm gonna stick with my reefer ain't messin' round with no cocaine
I'm gonna stick with my reefer ain't messin' round with no cocaine <start> Every now and then
Soft as breath upon my skin
I feel you come back again.
And it's like you haven't been
Gone a moment from my side.
Like the tears were never cried
Like the hands of time are holding you and me.
And with all my heart I'm sure
We're closer than we ever were.
I don't have to hear or see
I've got all the proof I need.
There are more than angels watching over me.
I believe Ohhh I believe.
Now when you die your life goes on
It doesn't end here when you're gone.
Every soul is filled with light
It never ends and if I'm right.
Our love can even reach across eternity
I believe Ohhh I believe.
Forever you're a part of me.
Forever in the heart of me.
I will hold you even longer if I can.
Oh the people who don't see the most
See that I believe in ghosts.
And if that makes me crazy then I am...
'Cause I believe.......
Ohhhh I believe...
There are more than angels watching over me.
I believe Ohhh I believe.
Every now and then
Soft as breath upon my skin
I feel you come back again.
And I believe. <start> 
Five hundred horses outside at the valet
I got the keys if you want we can leave here tonight

But it don't mean ish if somebody else is on your mind
'Cause I know yeah I know yeah I know
And I'm touchin' on you
That you know yeah you know yeah you know
What you're getting into
I don't care what he does
'Cause he's only wasting his time
And I know what you like what you like

Baby is it him or me
We can fix this easily
If you just follow me home now

'Cause you know he can't compete
I'm the only one you need
You should get me at hello now
Who's it gonna be 

It's paradise when I'm touching your body
Put my hands on your waist
We can keep making ways on if you want
You should be mine
'Cause you just ain't anybody
Take it or leave but I'll never leave you alone
So who's it gonna be
Baby is it him or me
We can fix this easily
If you just follow me home now
Who's it gonna be
'Cause you know he can't compete
I'm the only one you need
You should get me at hello now
Who's it gonna be 


'Cause I know yeah I know yeah I know

'Cause you know he can't compete
I'm the only one you need
You should get me at hello now
Who's it gonna be 



 <start> Well you are still here
And I am still here
Whether I ever loved you is
Not perfectly clear
You went a semester to West Texas State
But the freshmen fifteen you gained
Killed all your dates
I guess I still love you if I ever did
And I can see myself having a couple of kids
And we will get by
For the rest of our lives
So play the CottonEyed Joe
For the folks don't you know
Keep the dogs in the truck
Til you leave
We got some wieners and buns
When the brisket's all gone
For our wedding in suburban Seguin
Well I am still here
And you are still here
Whether I ever loved you is
Not perfectly clear
Though weight's not an issue you have gained more
And when I said I do well I slammed all the doors
To a future where I could see Paris in spring
And I wasn't prepared for the weight of this ring
But we will get by
For the rest of our lives
So play the CottonEyed Joe
For the folks don't you know
Keep the dogs in the truck
Til you leave
We got some wieners and buns
When the brisket's all gone
For our wedding in suburban Seguin
So play some old BTO
For my friends don't you know
Keep your dogs in the truck
Til you leave
Get out the wieners and buns
Cause the briskets all gone
At our wedding in suburban Seguin
I said I love you in suburban Seguin
Now lets make love <start> She's sun and rain she's fire and ice
A little crazy but it's nice
And when she gets mad you best leave her alone
'Cause she'll rage just like a river
Then she'll beg you to forgive her
She's every woman that I've ever known
She's so New York and then L.A.
And every town along the way
She's every place that I've never been
She's making love on rainy nights
She's a stroll through Christmas lights
And she's everything I want to do again
It needs no explanation
'Cause it all makes perfect sense
When it comes down to temptation
She's on both sides of the fence
No it needs no explanation
'Cause it all makes perfect sense
When it comes down to temptation
She's on both sides of the fence <start> Eyes be careful how you look at her don't be blinded by her charms
Ears don't cling to every little word she'll talk you back into her arms
Lips be careful how you long for her you know her kiss can bring the sweetest pain
Heart be careful please don't fall for her cause if you fall you break again
Arms be careful how you reach for her there's magic in her slightest touch
Feet be careful how you follow her don't let her know we care too much
Mind be careful how you think of her she's much too smart don't let her out her way
Heart you fool you've gone and fell for her I guess you know you'll have to pay <start> I was in love with your beauty from the day you walked my way
Oh how I wish that was enough to have made me want to stay
See I'm as true as I want to be and I must say my girl
I tried the best to give to you all of the truest in the world
But when I left your house that morning in that ragged Thunderbird
I tried so hard to fight the voices from the devil's that I heard
See there's a highway to the right of us I took it a year ago
And since a year ago can't drive past without turning down that road
And I knew it
I never should have turned the wheel
And I knew it
The voices calling me were real
I knew it
Listen to the song they sing
I knew I was wrong
And I knew I was wrong
So give me a try at describing just how difficult it is
When you kinda love two girls to figure out which one you miss
Stumble away from your stairway with your perfume on my clothes
Well I kinda loved two girls but now I've kinda lost 'em both
And I knew it
I never should have turned the wheel
And I knew it
The voices calling me were real
I knew it
Listen to the song they sing
I knew I was wrong
And I knew I was wrong
And if I could gather up the damage that I rendered in my life
Place it on a scale and weigh against the damage done that night
Then it'd be safe to say the weight of all I did and didn't do
Would surely float against the lightest wrong I ever did to you <start> I wandered so aimless my heart filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear Savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light
Just like a blind man I wandered alone
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light <start> God's gonna get 'cha for that
God's gonna get 'cha for that
There's no place to run and hide
For He knows where you're at
God's gonna get 'cha for that
God's gonna get 'cha for that
Every wrong thing that you do
God's gonna get 'cha for that
This doggone world we're living in
It's giving me a fit
It seems like everywhere I turn
I see a hypocrite
Well if ya wanna go to heaven
Well you can't live like that
So let me tell you brother
God's gonna get 'cha for that
God's gonna get 'cha for that yeah
God's gonna get 'cha for that
There's no place to run and hide
For He knows where you're at
God's gonna get 'cha for that yeah
God's gonna get 'cha for that
Every wrong thing that you do
God's gonna get 'cha for that
Now the preacher in our church
He's a mighty devoted man
Everybody thinks that he's agoin'
To the promised land
But the other night on a country road
While I was adrivin' through
I caught the preacher makin' love
To Sister Mary Lou
God's gonna get 'cha for that yeah
God's gonna get 'cha for that
There's no place to run an' hide
For He knows where you're at
God's gonna get 'cha for that yeah
God's gonna get 'cha for that
Every wrong thing that you do
God's gonna get 'cha for that
Now ol' Sister Bessie
She like to testify
She says 'I'll always love the Lord
Someday I'm agonna fly
But the other night while goin' by
The local liquor store
I caught ol' Sister Bessie
Flyin' out the door
God's gonna get 'cha for that
God's gonna get 'cha for that
There's no place to run and hide
For He knows where you're at
God's gonna get 'cha for that
God's gonna get 'cha for that
Every wrong thing that you do
God's gonna get 'cha for that
God's gonna get 'cha for that yeah
God's gonna get 'cha for that
There's no place to run and hide
For He knows where you're at
God's gonna get 'cha for that yeah
God's gonna get 'cha for that
Every wrong thing that you do
God's gonna get 'cha for that
God's gonna get 'cha for that yeah
God's gonna get 'cha for that
There's no place to run and hide
For He knows where you're at <start> There's just one place for me near you it's like heaven to be near you
Times when we're apart I can't face my heart
Say you'll never stray more than just two lips away
If my time could be spent near you I'd be more than content near you
Make my life worthwhile by telling me that I'll spend the rest of my days near you
Times when we're apart... <start> There was light in the room
Then you left and it was through
Then the frost started in
My toes and fingertips
And it spread
And it spread into my heart
And it spread
And it spread into my heart
Then for I don't know how long
I settled in to doing wrong
And as the wind fills the sail
Came the thought to hurt my self
Come on
And it spread
And it spread into my home
And it spread
And it spread into my soul
Well there are no lines
Separating the truth from the lie
Then you came back from space
With a brand new laugh and a different space
You took my hand and held it up
And shot my arm full of love
And it spread
And it spread into the world
And it spread ooh
And it spread into the world
Well there are no lines
Separating the truth from the lie <start> Stumbled to Bongo Java for a cup.
They're out of my favorite beans ain't that my luck
The heater in my car's blowin' cold.
Got my divorce attorney on the 'phone.
Says Girl I got your paper's ready.
It's the th of February
An' all my girlfriend's got roses.
Love's really got an attitude.
It'll turn you on it'll turn on you.
It's a sacred song in a wedding dress
It's a tattoo you wake up with.
But love ain't gonna make sense.
It is what it is.
Kroeger has exactly what I need
Ben and Jerry's and People magazine.
Walkin' in slow motion down my aisle
It's a stranger with a C'mon get you some smile.
He's so GQ he could be gay
His pick up line's borderline lame
But he's a pilot an' that's hot.
Love's really got an attitude.
It'll turn you on it'll turn on you.
It's a sacred song in a wedding dress
It's a tattoo you wake up with.
But love ain't gonna make sense.
It is what it is.
Instrumental break.
Love's really got an attitude.
It'll turn you on it'll turn on you.
If you have it you can't hide it.
If you want it you can't find it.
Thinking only complicates it.
You can lose it you can make it
But it ain't ever gonna make sense.
It is what it is.
Love's really got an attitude. <start> Big Sam left Seattle in the year of ninetytwo
With George Pratt his partner and brother Billy too
They crossed the Yukon river and they found the bonanza gold
Below that old white mountain
Just a little southeast of Nome
Sam crossed the Majestic mountains to the valleys far below
He talked to his team of huskies
As he mushed on through the snow
With the northen lights arunnin' wild
In the land of the midnight sun
Yes Sam McCord was a mighty man
In the year of nineteenone
Where the river is windin' big nuggets they're findin'
North to Alaska go north the rush is on
North to Alaska go north the rush is on
George turns to Sam with his gold in his hand
Said Sam you're lookin' at a lonely lonely man
I'd trade all the gold that's buried in this land
For one small band of gold to place on sweet little Jenny's hand
'Cause a man needs a woman to love him all the time
Remember Sam a true love is so hard to find
I'd build for my Jenny a honeymoon home
Below that old white mountain
Just a little southeast of Nome
Where the river is windin' big nuggets they're findin'
North to Alaska go north the rush is on
North to Alaska go north the rush is on <start> Yer a human thing
Who yah think that you're foolin'
Yer not foolin' not foolin' me
Yer a human thing
Yer so busy frontin'
Confusin' courage and acting
Move me
Move me
Could it really be so wrong
To let somebody somebody see
Move me
Move me
A girl can keep it together
Come on now you know you we'll take the weather
Come on now you know we love your weather
You got roots cannot be torn from under
Won't you shake it like you've never done before
You've got roots cannot be torn from under
Won't you shake it like you've never done before
You're a human thing <start> Out on the porch swing
Like some old painting
He seems like he don't move at all
And somewhere a bell rings
And he's just remembering
The last time that she ever called
He picks up the phone and he says to the dial tone
It's still life without you
And I still hold on
What it feels like
You can't go by that
It's still life still life without you
The chances were given
To get on with living
The truth is that he never tried
And no one ever sees him
Most folks don't even
Remember which one of them died
But he still denies it he closes his eyes and
It's still life without you
And I still hold on
What it feels like
You can't go by that
It's still life still life without you
Oh still life still life without you
Out on the porch swing
Like some old painting
It seems like he don't move at all <start> I'm Eddy Arnold and I wanna tell you
About the most performed song of the past century
It was written by two school teachers
In Olive Hill Kentucky
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday happy birthday
Happy birthday to you <start> That sad old train
Sleepin' on an old rusty track
She was from another time
Gone with the wind like the smoke from that old stack
She brought smiles and wavin' hands
As she whistled by a sleepy town
It was once the way to go
Just a shiny nickel and you were homeward bound
And Ive seen better days like that sad old train
On an old abandoned track
When you were holdin' me I knew someday youd leave
Like that old train you wont be comin' back
She gently rumbled in the sunshine
As she carried home the mail
Her letters keepin' lovers waitin'
And friendly little boys placin' pennies on her rails
I can relate to that old train
Since you left me all alone again
And no one ever comes around
Once upon a time we were ridin' on the wind
Ive seen better days like that old sad train
On an old forgotten track
When you were holdin' me I knew someday youd leave
Like that old train you wont be comin' back
Like that old train never comin' back <start> There's a lady living right above me
Pretty as a picture on the wall
Once I helped her with a bag of groceries
We met a time or two out in the hall
She told me somebody hurt her feelings
The hurt that's in her eyes is plain to see
Slowly she's been wearing out my ceiling
Walkin' the floor over me
Every night I hear her cryin'
Cryin' over some old memory
A little of my heart is down here dyin'
'Cause she's walkin' the floor over me
Back and forth I followed every footstep
Countin' long enough to fall asleep
Had the sweetest dream last night 'cause I dreamt
She was walkin' the floor over me <start> Don't it seem to rain a lot in our lives
A dark cloud always seems to hide our blue skies
Yet this Texas sun has burned its way right through my brain
Now my job is done and hard times follow just like rain
California seems to be the place to go
Dreams out there come true they say it's time to go
But our California dreams turned out to be just lies
Don't it seem to rain a lot in our lives
But somewhere we'll find new dreams and sunshine
Green fields and blue skies where blue birds fly
Where the only rain is a summer shower to cool the night
Yes somewhere there's new dreams and sunshine
Last night I went to Tennessee in new dreams
Where cotton jumped into your sack and money grew from trees
But when I awoke and found I had dream and almost cried
Don't it seem to rain a lot in our lives <start> Well did you ever sleep at the foot of the bed when the weather was whizzin' cold
When the wind was a howlin' round the house and the moon was yeller as gold
And you give your good warm mattress up to Aunt Lizzie and Uncle Fred
How too many kinfolks on a bad night and you went to the foot of the bed
Well I could always wait till the old folks ate and eat the leavin's with grace
The teacher could keep me after school I'd still have a smile on my face
I could wear the big girls' wornout clothes or let sister have my sled
But it always did get my nanny goat to sleep at the foot of the bed
 ac.guitar 
It was fine enough when kinfolks come and the kid brought brand new games
You could see how fat all the old folks was and learn all the babies' names
Had biscuits and custard and chicken pie we all got Sunday fed
But I always knew when nighttime come I was headed for the foot of the bed
Now they say some folks don't know what it is havin' company all over the place
To rassle for cover on a winter night with a big foot settin' in your face
Or cold toenails a scratchin' your back and the footboard scrubbin' your head
Well I'll tell the world you ain't lost a thing never sleepin' at the foot of the bed
Well I've done it over and over again in this land of the brave and the free
And in this all fired battle of life it's left its mark on me
For I'm always a strugglin' around at the foot instead of forgin' ahead
And I don't think it's caused from a doggone thing
But a sleepin' at the foot of the bed <start> I thought I'd be an angel
And fly on astral skies
I thought I'd wear a fanciful disguise
And It's taken me a lotta time
To find out I'm not one
An outlaw on the run
On this side of the sun.
I hoped I'd be a champion
And live without a care
I thought I'd change the world
Make it just and fair
But my youth slipped by before my eyes
Much to my surprise
Before I had begun
On this side of the sun.
Out on this end of the wind
Winter's coming 'round the bend
You pray for rain before you know
You're standin' in a foot of snow
So you pull your coat up to your chin
Pick your shovel up again
'Cause your work is never done
On this side of the sun.
Instrumental
I took it to a fortune teller
I thought that she might help me
She looked into my eyes
And smiled mysteriously
But she didn't know as much as me
I stared back dejectedly
'Cause I know where she's from
This side of the sun.
Out behind these prison walls
Dark clouds come and hard rains fall
You pause a moment for a dream
They row you gently down the stream
You wake up angry in the night
Jump up ready for the fight
But the war is never won
On this side of the sun.
Now they tell me music
Can free a person's soul
So I sing a song everywhere I go
But It's not much different than before
I'm still looking for the door
I wonder if there is one
On this side of the sun... <start> Zai na yaoyuan de guxiang

 <start> Well I don't care if the sun don't shine I don't care if the bells don't chime
Just as long as you love me
And I don't care if the tops don't spin I don't care if the gins won't gin
Just as long as you love me
So darling let it rain let it snow let the cold north wind blow
Just as long as you love me
North or south east or west you know I will stand the test
Just as long as you love me
Well I don't care if the birds don't sing I don't care if the bells don't ring
Just as long as you love me
I don't care if the world don't turn I don't care if the fire don't burn
Just as long as you love me
So darling let it rain...
Oh darling just as long as you love me <start> Though you've gone away
I play your favorite song
In the blue and gold
With your dark glasses on
I always think I see you
Across the avenue
Walking by where I lost you
It's all I ever do
You just walked away
We'll meet tonight Ok
Going against the light
Run down in front of me
I always think I see you
Across the avenue
Some day I'll come to meet you
On the other side
Across the avenue
Across the avenue
Though you've gone away
I wear your favorite shirt
Sitting in the sun
By the library lines
I always think I see you
Across the avenue
Some day I'll come to meet you
On the other side
Across the avenue
Across the avenue
Across the avenue
Across the avenue <start> Let me go with you don't leave me I'll miss you I'll love you
Now that I've kissed you I'll never forget you I know it's true
If I can only tag along I'll do it to be with you
Don't make my heart believe it's long tell me you want me too
Let me go with you don't leave me I'll miss you I'm scared of the blues
Scared of the blues
Let me go with you and I'll never let you get lonesome
Let me be near you and my love is yours when you need someone
If only to be your old standby having to share your kiss
I'd rather be than left to die craving the love I'd miss
Let me go with you don't leave me I'll miss you I'm scared of the blues
Scared of the blues <start> Of all the lives to live why this one
Filled with couldhavebeen. No fun.
Countless nights of anxious frustrations.
Of all the lives to live why this one
Of all the souls to meet why these two
One old and dark furious as a shrugging ocean.
The other shiny fresh as a winter morning.
Of all the souls to meet why these two
Another night in bed with you
Another day beside you gone.
Slipping softly off to sleep
You say do you ever wonder why this one
A dusty simpleminded piece of fiction.
Strange and odd twisted as a contradiction.
A glittering jewel of flaws and celebration.
Another night in bed with you
Another day beside you gone.
Slipping softly off to sleep
You say do you ever wonder why this one
You say do you ever wonder why this one
You say do you ever wonder why this one
Why this one why this one why this one <start> Sometimes there's such a fine line
Between the fire in my heart and the fear in my mind
What do I hold on to what do I leave behind
Which side is the right side of a fine line
One day love is rolling down the highway
And the next day love is stopping on a dime
Just when you think you've figured out the answers
Love will change the question every time
Sometimes there's such...
Could we sit down face to face and talk things over
We can't keep treading water and buying time
Is the love we made together worth the saving
Is the view from on the mountain worth the climb
Sometimes there's such...
Oh which side is the right side of a fine line <start> Gonna find a perfect mountain gonna stay until I die
Drink of mother nature's fountain let my worries roll on by
Well the good times go easy and the bad times go slow
Even in the inbetween times I can't let my worries go
Always wanting to go somewhere but I never fail to find
I grow tired of what I find there long for things I left behind
Gonna find a perfect mountain
Well I can think of nothing better than a sweetheart for a friend
Before I find the two together I'm afraid my days shall end
Always wanting to go somewhere but I never fail to find
I grow tired of what I find there long for things I left behind
Gonna find a perfect mountain
Let my worries roll on by <start> And when it's one on one she's a different kind of girl
In a lovin' kind of world where our own private day has just begun
And when it's one on one after all the daily grind
I'm the one thing on her mind when she whispers now it's one on one
She likes to have attentions and she gets it everywhere she ever goes
She loves crowds and noisy parties goin' out at night and wearin' sexy clothes
She's a lady every minute if she's working hard or out just having fun
But through it all I know she's thinking bout the time when it gets down to one on one
And when it's one on one... <start> I have seen the paddle wheelers
Rolling south on a summers day
Ive seen the lovers at the guardrails
With stars in their lemonade
And Ive heard the hobos gather
Heard their banjos brace the blade
Heard them sing about the river
Called it the lazy mans parade
Sing me that song about the river
Green going away
You know I always did feel like a drifter
At this time of day
Last night I stood by the highway
Pretended I was on my way
You know a hundred thousand headlights
Couldnt match the milky way
And when the moonlight touches the water
Surely something touches me
And I go reaching for the river
Like its reaching for the sea
Sing me that song about the river
Green going away
You know I always did feel like a drifter
At this time of day
Somethings go on forever
But truth dont ever stray
The wind may brush the water
But the river holds its way
Sing me that song about the river
Green going away
You know I always did feel like a drifter
At this time of day <start> It Starts
The sun comes up the sun goes down
the hands on the clock go round and round
you just get up and it's time to lay down 
life gets teejus don't it <start> Like the weather your heart changes with each season
Springtime summer fall and winter too
Though I know I'll never understand the reason
I still wonder why each season changes you
It was springtime when I found you like the flowers
And our love grew warmer with the summer sun
In the fall I could see our love was changing
It broke my heart to see what wintertime had done
Like the weather your heart changes...
Trumpet
Came the spring again you said that you were sorry
And the summer brought a golden memory
In the fall I saw your love was changing
And the winter brought the same old misery
Like the weather your heart changes... <start> She's still the angel that I knew before the only difference now is she's mine
In an apron or a nightgown or the wedding dress she wore
She's a perfect angel all the time
You know it's funny how when you first meet a girl
And start likin' her you always see her at her best
All made up her hair just right dressed nicely
And you just assume she's like that  hours a day
Then when you get married it's facecream and bodypins and hairrollers at night
Makeup eyelashes hairspray in the mornin'
Soapsuds floorwax and bacon grease through the day
And then you stop and think about it
And she's really goin' through all the stuff just for you
And knowin' that makes her all the more beautiful
She's still the angel... <start>  DOLLARS AND A FLASK OF CROWN

GOT  DOLLARS AND A FLASK OF CROWN. <start> Well it's Saturday night
Your all dressed up in blue.
I've been watchin' you a while
Maybe you've been watchin' me too.
So somebody ran out
Left somebody's heart a mess.
Well if you're lookin' for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest.
Some girls they want a handsome Dan
Or some good lookin' Joe
On their arm some girls want a sweet talkin' Romeo.
But round here baby
I've learned you get what you can get
So if your lookin' for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest.
Oh your road is dark
And there's a thin thin line
But I want you to know
I'd walk it for you anytime.
And all your other boyfriends
They couldn't pass the test.
So if you're lookin' for love
Honey I'm Tougher than the rest.
Well it ain't no secret
I've been around a time or two.
Well I don't know but
Maybe you've been around too.
Well there's another dance
All you gotta do is say yes.
And if you're lookin' for Love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest.
And if you're ready for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest. <start> I am just a poor boy though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my existence
On a pocket full of mumbles such are promises
All lies in jest till a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest
Well I left my home and family I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station runnin' scared
Layin' low seeking out the poor quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know
Li li li
Li li li li li li li
Li li li
Li li li li li li li
Li li li
Only seeking workman's wages I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a comeon from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there
In alaying out my winter clothes and wishing I was home
Going home
Where the New York City winters aren't ableeding me
Bleeding me
Going home
Da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every bloke that laid him down or cleft him
Till he cried out in his anger and his shame
I am leaving I am leaving
But the fighter still remains

Though you must be a knowin' I got a big big love
It's not the kind to be concealin' just the kind to be revealin'
It's not a little bitty feelin' I got a big big love
I think it's time we done some walkin' I think it's time we done some talkin'
There's a great big moon above we got a big big love
This is not infatuation this is a true love sensational
It's not my imagination I got a big big love for you
 steel 
Can't you tell my love's a growin'... <start> I have a story I'd like to tell broken heart's knowin' only too well
And she knows why I feel the way I do
She gave me love and took it away blue sky has turned to a solid grey
And she knows why I feel the way I do
Well I know I'm a walkin' down the lovesick trails been walked down by many before
But when she sees my side of tracks she'll know I've learned the score
I pick my tears put 'em on the shelf keep my heartaches to myself
And she knows why I feel the way I do
 guitar 
When she finds somebody new he'll find out what I went through
And she knows why I feel the way I do
She gave me love and took it away blue skies had turned to a solid grey
And she knows why I feel the way I do
Well I know I'm a walkin' down...
She knows why I feel the way I do <start> Whether it starts with an earthquake
or the tears of a few grieving women
I don't know
On the road to gathering
looking for someone to roll away the stone
he stands alone in her room
as the commotion slowly decays
I don't know
she's on her way to somewhere new
looking for someone to roll away the stone
It's these idle tales that we need to keep us moving
these tales keep us going
it's these idle tales that we need to tell our children
these tales are for our children
She stands upon an empty stage with a song she was born to sing
she's on the road again <start> Well I left my old home back in the mountains
For mother and father had both passed away
We followed our mother up to the graveyard
For mother wews called to Heaven that day
Mother's not dead she's only asleeping
Just patiently waiting for Jesus to come
The birds will be singing while mother is sleeping
They will sing o're her as the grave sinks away
Oh how we miss her round the old home place
Everything seems so lonesome since she went away
Mother is sleeping way back in the mountains
Yes Mother is sleeping way back in the hills
Mother's not dead she's only asleeping
Just patiently waiting for Jesus to come
The birds will be singing while mother is sleeping
They will sing o're her as the grave sinks away <start> I just received your letter oh I've waited darling for so long to hear from you
And you say you love me but you want to know dear if I've been untrue to you
Yes I love you only and I've been so lonely dear I've waited for so long
No there's been no other for no one could ever make me feel the way you do
 steel  ac.guitar 
Please come home and get me take me with you next time
When you say you'll be ocean blue
I'm so wild about you I can't live without you don't you feel the same way too
Yes I love you only...
Yes I love you only... <start> Right away I lost my pride and right away we could lie
It's not like I said it would be it's not so easy to forget you I see
I said I would never cry at all if you should leave I'd never try to call
But oh how so wrong I could be oh please won't you come back to me
I said I would never cry at all if you should leave I'd never try to call
But oh how so wrong I could be oh please won't you come back to me <start> Hear that lonesome whipoorwill he sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low I'm so lonesome I could cry
I've never seen a night so long when time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind a cloud to hide its face and cry
Did you ever hear a robin weep when leaves began to die
That mean he's lost the will to live I'm so lonesome I could cry
The silence of a falling star lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are I'm so lonesome I could cry <start> I found him by the railroad track this morning I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened just to hear the words the dyin' fellow said
He said they let me out of prison out in Frisco for ten long years I paid for what I done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana to see my Rose and get to know my son
Give my love to Rose please won't you Mister
Take her all my money tell her buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him and don't forget to give my love to Rose
 guitar  steel 
Won't you tell them I said thanks for waitin' for me
Tell my boy to help his mom at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another cause it ain't right she should live alone
Mister here's the bag with all my money it won't last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning now don't forget to give my love to Rose
Give my love to Rose...
Please don't forget to give my love to Rose <start> I came in here tonight
To do a little thinking
When I left home I promised her twice
I ain't going drinking
Then you walk in
And knock me down
We could slip away but in a few days
It'll be all over town
But my country conscience will tell on me
The roots of my raisingrun too deep
Sometimes temptation can make a strong man weak
But my country conscience won't let me cheat
I started to leave
Then I hesitated
I looked in her eyes
And I was almost persuaded
Then she took my hand
But when she touched my ring
A voice in my head spoke up and said
Son you're doing the wrong thing
But my country conscience will tell on me
The roots of my raisingrun too deep
Sometimes temptation can make a strong man week
But my country conscience won't let me cheat
My country conscience won't let me cheat <start> Night and stars above that shine so bright
The myst'ry of their fading light
That shines upon our caravan
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep
Across the sand so I may keep
The mem'ry of our caravan
This is so exciting
You are so inviting
Resting in my arms
As I thrill to the magic charms
Of you beside me here beneath the blue
My dream of love is coming true
Within our desert caravan <start> I was hoping it wouldn't rain no not today
There's so many things that I gotta do
There's eight hundred miles to go on this old highway
Each turn I take brings me back to you
I can't forget
You're like a song stuck in my head
Going 'round and 'round again
No I can't shut it off I can't make it stop
I remember the last word you said
You're like a song stuck in my head
You said I'll always love you like you love me
You kissed me and whispered goodbye
Your eyes filled with tears as I turned to leave
That picture still burning in my mind
I can't forget
You're like a song stuck in my head
Going 'round and 'round again
And oh I can't shut it off I can't make it stop
I remember the last word you said
You're like a song stuck in my head
I don't know where tomorrow is gonna take me
Maybe run away again or maybe run back to you
You're like a song stuck in my head
Going 'round and 'round again
No I can't shut it off I can't make it stop
I remember the last word you said
You're like a song stuck in my head
Stuck in my head <start> Today I heard the awful news
Someone told the gospel truth
Said you've been running 'round
With a stranger who just hit town
He's got a black mustache
And a red Cadillac
Now he's got you
And I've got two
Divorce lawyers on my back
Single again
Back on the streets again
The old bars ain't changed much
Just a new face or two
When you're out of touch
Single again
Born to lose dying to win
Only thing I'm running from
Is the alimony man
Because I'm single again
Drifting around from bar to bar
Running into our old friends
They won't know where ya are
Last I heard a little while back
You were cruising town in his Cadillac
Drinkin' champagne...showing off a diamond ring
I'm getting by
In these hard times
Livin' from drink to drink
Single again
A'back on the streets again
The old bars ain't changed much
Just a new face or two
When you're out of touch
Single again
Born to lose dying to win
The only thing I'm a'running from
Is the alimony man
'Cause I'm single again <start> If you never come to me again
I've had the love of a lifetime and I've had a best friend
I wish that I spent with you all the best I'll ever spend
Even if you never come to me again
Chorus
Cause you are the love of a lifetime lady
You are the best a man can do
You are the love of a lifetime lady
If you never come to me again I'll still be lovin you
I'll still be lovin you
And if you never sleep here in my arms again
I've had the love of a lifetime and I've had a best friend
It's not that I wouldn't mind losing you it's just that you taught me to win
Even if you never sleep in my arms again
Chorus
I'll be lovin you
I'll still be lovin you
Chorus <start> I loved you more in just a few hours than most people love in all of their years
And now though you're gone I still have you with me
The sweetest reflections fill the loneliest tears
And I'll spend my life loving a mem'ry chasing a rainbow without any gold
I spend my nights dreaming about you loving a mem'ry I never can hold
 piano 
Oh what a mark you left on my body destroyed my heart and crippled my mind
And if I should live until I'm one hundred
I'll never forget you there's not enough time
And I'll spend my life...
Loving a mem'ry I never can hold <start> The day we met
I'll never forget
Was the luckiest of my life
She took me so far
And I broke her heart
Now I'm sittin here
With the simple truth
That tears me apart
Chorus
All I had goin is gone
The best I'll ever do
Is over and done
It serves me right
'Cause I did her wrong
Now all I had goin is gone
Sometimes a man
Just don't understand
He possesses everything life can bring
He thinks there's more
So he has to explore
Leavin her alone
Time after time
Til she wlaked out my door
Now it serves me right
She left me alone
Now all I had goin is gone <start> Verse 
When the last breath of life
Is gone from my body
And my lips are as cold as the sea
When my friends gather 'round
For my farewell party
Want you pretend you love me
Chorus
There will be flowers from those
Who cry when I'm gone
And leave you in this world alone
I know you'll have fun
At my farewell party
I know you'll be glad when I'm gone
Verse 
Don't be mad at me for wanting to keep you
Till my life on this old world is through
You'll be free at the end of my farewell party
But I'll go away loving you
Repeat Chorus
Oh I know you'll be glad when I'm gone <start> She ...
She came from the land of the cotton
A land that was nearly forgotten
By everyone
And she ...
She worked and she slaved so hard
A big ol' field was her backyard
In the delta sun
Oh but she sure could sing
Yes yes
She sure could sing
Then he ...
Looked down and he took a little pity
The whole town swore he decided
He help her some
And he
Didn't mind if she wasn't very pretty
For deep inside his heart he knew
She was the only one
Oh but she sure could sing
My my she sure could sing
She had faith and she had believin'
She led all the people together in singin'
And she prayed very night
To the Lord up above
Singin' hallelujah
Oh hallelujah
They ...
Would walk singin' songs by the river
Even when she knew for sure
She had to go away
And she
Never knew what her life had to give her
And never had to worry about it
For one single day
Oh but she sure could sing
Yes yes she sure could sing <start> Sittin' on a bench at West Town Mall
He sat down in his overalls and asked me
You waitin' on a woman
I nodded yeah and said how 'bout you
He said son since nineteen fiftytwo I've been
Waitin' on a woman
When I picked her up for our first date
I told her I'd be there at eight
And she came down the stairs at eightthirty
She said I'm sorry that I took so long
Didn't like a thing that I tried on
But let me tell you son she sure looked pretty
Yeah she'll take her time but I don't mind
Waitin' on a woman
He said the wedding took a year to plan
You talk about an anxious man I was nervous
Waitin' on a woman
And then he nudged my arm like old men do
And said I'll say this about the honeymoon it was worth it
Waitin' on a woman
And I don't guess we've been anywhere
She hasn't made us late I swear
Sometimes she does it just 'cause she can do it
Boy it's just a fact of life
It'll be the same with your young wife
Might as well go on and get used to it
She'll take her time 'cause you don't mind
Waitin' on a woman
I've read somewhere statistics show
The man's always the first to go
And that makes sense 'cause I know she won't be ready
So when it finally comes my time
And I get to the other side
I'll find myself a bench if they've got any
I hope she takes her time 'cause I don't mind
Waitin' on a woman
Honey take your time 'cause I don't mind
Waitin' on a woman <start> I saw your shoes by the kitchen door and I knew I missed you
I saw your shoes by the front door and I began to miss you more
I saw your shoes on the landing and Lord I knew I cared
I saw your shoes pretty baby and I longed to have you there
I saw your shoes by the record player and I wished you'd call me
I saw your shoes by the TV set I prayed you'd call
I saw your shoes by the couch and I longed to feel your touch babe
I saw your shoes pretty baby and I had to have you there
I see your shoes by the shower stall and I begin to wondering
I see your shoes by the bedroom door and my heart starts pounding
I see your shoes at the foot of the bed and I start laughing
I see your shoes pretty baby but most of all I see you <start> If you're a man like me who's good at leaving
If you like your space and you love your freedom
Don't see yourself as ever settling down
Or your whole world being tossed around
Be wary of a woman
A woman so fine
Don't wanna change you
Loves you just right
Makes you feel like a man inside
Sometimes she'll make you cry
Till you don't know what your doing
Your out of control
Forget about leaving your heart wont go
If don't like that you better run and hide
And be wary of a woman like mine
Shell make you laugh when you feel like crying
Make you wanna live when you feel like dying
So if you like living in the dark
Just walk away your gonna lose your heart
Be wary of a woman
A woman so fine
Don't wanna change you
Loves you just right
Makes you feel like a man inside
Sometimes she'll make you cry
Till you don't know what your doing
Your out of control
Forget about leaving your heart wont go
If don't like that you better run and hide
And be wary of a woman like mine
Be wary of a woman like mine
Man you don't stand a chance don't even try
Be wary of a woman like mine
Be wary of a woman
A woman so fine
Don't wanna change you
Loves you just right
Makes you feel like a man inside
Sometimes she'll make you cry
Till you don't know what your doing
Your out of control
Forget about leaving your heart wont go
If don't like that you better run and hide
And be wary of a woman like mine
A woman like mine
Be wary of a woman like mine
A woman like mine <start> I am Thine oh Lord I have heard Thy voice and it told Thy love to me
But I long to rise in the arms of faith and be closer drawn to Thee
Draw me nearer nearer blessed Lord to the cross where Thou has died
Draw me nearer nearer nearer blessed Lord to Thine precious bleeding side
Consecrate me now to Thy service Lord by the power of grace divine
Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope and my will be lost in Thine
Draw me nearer nearer blessed Lord...
 piano 
There are depths of love that I cannot know till I cross the narrow sea
There are heights of joy that I may not reach till I rest in peace with Thee <start> You know if I'd seen her comin'
I'd probably tried to hide
But I came around the corner
And she caught me by surprise
There was no ice cold shoulder
There was no ugly scene
She just smiled and didn't say
The things I thought she'd say to me
It was nothin' like that rainy night
She left and slammed the door
Not only she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore
I felt like some neighbor
Just some guy she once knew
You'd never know she loved me
And I broke her heart in two
Was she hidin' her emotions
Or did she really get that strong
Right then she turned and
Introduced me to her new friend John
I could tell the way he shook my hand
He'd never heard of me before
Not only she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore
There was no ice cold shoulder
There was no ugly scene
She just smiled and didn't say
The things I knew she'd say to me
I guess she got so caught up in him
My memory's gone ignored
Not only she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore
I know it might sound crazy
But I don't know what hurts me more
Is it the fact that she don't love me
Or she don't hate me anymore <start> Well it's hard to find a night horse
That one surefooted right horse
To ride a cowboy safely through the dark
The finest one I ever rode
Was a shortleg bay named Little Joe
When I signed on with this outfit in South Park
Well the night was still and the moon went down
Through the herd there was not a sound
That's the time an old hand knows a cow might run
Sure enough they jumped and ran
Went crashin' through the smooth strand
And twenty buckaroos knew what was to come
Chorus
They're runnin' boys they're runnin'
You all go run along
Don't try to turn 'em back 'til they tire
Just let 'em run their course
Turn it over to your night horse
Let him bring you back on home to the fire
Well a lot of things that night happened
That later got us laughin'
'Though in the moment we were all strung out pretty tight
Joe Petty thought a clump of chimeeza
Was a bedded down herd of cows
So he circled around 'em singin' 'til daylight
Then his night horse stolen by the cook
Old Bill Jim got set afoot
Cussin' out that cook as they rode away
But they didn't go far and they had a bad wreck
Bill's horse died of a broken neck
And the cook stumbled through the night in a daze
Chorus
Well it's gopher holes and steep ravines
That in the night cannot be seen
So he must use somethin' other than his eyes
Whatever birds fly south on
I guess that's what he counts on
Little Joe could carry me through to sunrise
Chorus
Just let 'em run their course
Turn it over to your night horse
Let him bring you back on home to the fire <start> 
You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Strangers meet and they willingly surrender
Oh What a Christmas to remember
Almost went to Aspen but something told me no
I considered Mammoth but there wasn't enough snow
And I even thought of Gatlinburg but that seemed so far to go
So I headed up to Tahoe for a Christmas on the slopes
And I had fantasized about Christmas in this way
Curled up by a fireplace in a Tahoe ski chalet
With a fast talking lover and some slow burning wood
But even in my wildest dreams it never got this good and
You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Change the radio and I'll turn the lights down dimmer
Oh What a Christmas to remember
Strangers when we met lovers as we leave
Christmas to remember too good to believe
Don't know how or when but I know we'll meet again
We'll come blowin' back to somewhere like some wild restless winter's wind
And you've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender
Oh What a Christmas to remember
We loved and laughed and played and joked
Sang Christmas songs and talked to folks
Sleighed the fields and skied the slopes
Then to the lodge for dinner
But now it's time for us to go
As our hearts melt like chimney snow
There's just one thing I want to know
Can we do this next winter
Oh What a Christmas to remember
You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Though the fire is hot we'll just have to let it simmer
Oh What a Christmas to remember
You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Though it's cold outside we'll just stroke the burning embers
Oh What a Christmas to remember <start> You were once a sweet little girl
So innocent and pure
Your eyes were open and sure
Anyone could look right in
And I followed closely your gaze
You looked up towards the sky
And I watched your face drift away
Other things had caught your eye
Oh the magazines and media supplied you with their plastic protocol
Oh and maybe music television really is the devil after all
But all I can say is I knew you before you were beautiful back then
Before you grew up before you gave in
And you dream of sharing your heart
Instead you share your bed
And your heart beats empty and cold
With all the tears you have shed
And you dream of baring your soul
Instead you bare more skin
And you wear dark glasses to keep
Anyone from looking in
Oh the magazines and media supplied you with their plastic protocol
Oh and maybe music television really is the devil after all
But all I can say is I knew you before you were beautiful back then
Before you grew up before you gave in
And all you want is to hear the words
Dear baby I love you
So you hike your skirt higher still
'Til their eyes are all on you
You drive in fast foreign cars
The color of your sin
And you tint your windows to keep
Anyone from looking in
Oh and all I can say is I knew you before you were beautiful back then
Before you grew up before you gave in
And all I can say is I knew you before you were beautiful back then
You could be beautiful again <start> They're a gonna put me in the movies they're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man who's sad and lonely and all I gotta do is act naturally
Well I'll bet you I'm a gonna be a big star might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies are gonna make me a big star cause I can play the part so well
I hope you'll come to see me in the movies and I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time and all I gotta do is act naturally
We'll make a scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part that I won't need rehearsing and all I gotta do is act naturally
Well I'll bet you I'm a gonna be a big star...
And all I gotta do is act naturally <start> You are my sunshine you are my rain
You make me happy  never complain
When life gets tested and all disarranged
You clear the air  help me not go insane
CHORUS
I cant afford a life for me
See what you see
How could you be OK with one like me
I have your shoulder I have your heart
When we are together when we are apart
Love just keeps coming at such a blinding speed
You hold me up  save me up from the stampede
CHORUS
I cant afford a life for me
See what you see
How could you be OK with one like me <start> My baby girl just turned five
Got her mamas smarts
And her daddys eyes
She thinks Im  feet tall
King of the world and thats not all.
When Im acting like a fool
Thats when she thinks my jokes are cool
When shes riding on my back
Im superman and thats a fact.
Im just an ordinary guy
I cant stop bullets and I cant fly
But I can be the one who dries her eyes
And makes her smile when she cries
I may never be the man she thinks I am
But Im gonna be the best one that I can.
Shes never seen my name in lights
But her eyes light up when I get home at night
She takes her pony for a ride
And still wants her daddy by her side.
I make her booboos go byebye
Sing her to sleep with a lullaby
Im just a joyous phenomenon
Cause sooner or later shes gonna catch on.
Im just an ordinary guy
I cant stop bullets and I cant fly
But I can be the one who dries her eyes
And makes her smile when she cries
I may never be the man she thinks I am
But Im gonna be the best one that I can.
Someday her heart will find another man
Wholl take my place
Just the way god planned
Then shell understand.
Im just an ordinary guy
I cant stop bullets and I cant fly
For now Ill be the one who dries her eyes
And makes her smile when she cries
I may never be the man she thinks I am
But Im gonna be the best dad that I can. <start> They got the Coliseum rockin' and they're making quite a din
Singin' here we go Oilers here we go again
There ain't no louder building than the house of ninetynine
Got the echoes of the dynasty a burnin' in their minds
You better cheer 'em on they're the roughest necks around.
'Cause it's hockey night in Edmonton the Oil's back in town yeah
Skatin' quick and passin' pretty fastest ice around the league
The goalie stacks 'em up and makes a save you can't believe
Elbows in the corners and she's getting kinda rough
But I know we've got some boys that ain't afraid to drop the gloves
You better cheer 'em on they're the roughest necks around
'Cause it's hockey night in Edmonton the Oil's back in town yeah
All they got is broken noses missin' teeth and blackened eyes
Beards and blood and guts and stitches keepin' playoff hopes alive
And the spirit of the boys from the Eighties in their eyes
Come on and say it with me say it Five cups five
You better cheer 'em on 'cause they're better than the rest
They got the blue and orange colours of the Oilers on their chests yeah
Well I got me a couple tickets take my baby to the game
'Cause the road trip's over winnin' every game away
Don't really need my radio but bring it anyway
Catch the skipper Roddy Phillips call the playbyplay
You better cheer 'em on they're the roughest necks around
'Cause it's hockey night in Edmonton the Oil's back in town. <start> I wonder if she thinks of me or ever needs someone
Who cares for her the way I did not long ago
I wonder if she's found someone to stay close by her side
To tell her things I never could that keep her satisfied
And now and then the many ways she shows her to love me
She always did the best she could to understand
When I bring home the troubles I'd been fightin' with all day
She'd take my hand and ease my mind with all her loving ways
Now she comes to me in secret when I lay me down to sleep
A dream of love so soft and low my heart will always keep
I wonder if she ever dreams or ever thinks of me
Forgiving for never giving love to her
And if she does then maybe she'll come back to me someday
And take my hand and ease my mind with all her loving ways <start> Walk me to the door and hold me close just one more time
Kiss me just once more the way you did when you were mine
The longest walk I'll ever take will be across that floor
That's why I'm asking one last favor walk me to the door
I love another won't you let me be these are the words that you said to me
How can I go through life without you like it was before
When I can't even make it to the door
Walk me to the door...
I promise I won't try to make amendsI know I don't deserve you back again
My trembling lips are begging now they never did before
Just one last favor walk me to the door
Walk me to the door... <start> Oh they tell me of a place and they tell me of a day
Where the saints shall be gathered to stay
They shall come from the east they shall come from the west
Whe we gather on that roundup day
When it's roundup time in heaven and our travels on earth are on
All the friends that day has served shall gather on that golden shore
Twill be sweet when we meet at Jesus feet
With no heartaches no pains no sigh
When they're on heaven's plains will they find your name
At the great roundup in the sky
Twill be sweet when we meet... <start> You ain't never fell as far as when you fall in love
Except the fall you take when you've been loved and given up
When you have your heart and soul rubbed into the dirt
An eightyproof bottle of tearstopper will take away the hurt
Give me an eightyproof bottle of tearstopper
And I'll start feeling I forgot her
Get a little loose and lose her memory
And I won't think I'm close to dying
Because it dries up all my crying
An eightyproof bottle of tearstopper always sets me free
It ain't easy losing love although it's turned out bad
All at once you're turning off old feelings you once had
But I found a helping hand right here in my hand
And eightyproof bottle of tearstopper will help me take 'em out
Give me an eightyproof bottle of tearstopper
And I'll start feeling I forgot her
Get a little loose and lose her memory
And I won't think I'm close to dying
Because it dries up all my crying
An eightyproof bottle of tearstopper always sets me free <start> I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart
And as the door of love between us closes
Tears will fall like petals when we part
I've begged you to be different but you'll always be untrue
I'm tired of forgiving now there's nothing I can do
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart
You made our lover's lane a road of sorrow
Till at last we had to say goodbye
You're leaving me to face each blue tomorrow
With a broken heart you taught to cry
I know that I should hate you after all you've put me through
But how can I be bitter when I'm still in love with you
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart
One for every time you broke my heart <start> I can't go to sleep
I've been tossing and turning all night
I can't even eat
I've lost all my appetite
I know what it is
And there's nothing I can do
I've been like this
Since the moment I laid eyes on you
Oh no not love again
This can't be happening
You'd think I'd know by now
What I'm getting into
I just can't help myself
This feeling's got me
Feeling out of control
Here I go
Oh no not love again
I know it's too late
To turn my heart around
There's no way to stop
Once you're on love's merrygoround
The best I can do
Is to hope it all works out right
All I know now is how
I feel in your arms tonight
Oh no not love again
This can't be happening
You'd think I'd know by now
What I'm getting into
I just can't help myself
This feeling's got me
Feeling out of control
Here I go
Oh no not love again <start> I'm waiting on the green light to make you mine
But your heart's just taking its own sweet time
You want to be sure if you'll sink or swim
Well grab ahold of me and just jump on in
You're playing it safe
But baby I'll wait
Chorus
Oh whenever you're ready
I could be yours in a second or so
Oh baby come and get me
My heart's sittin' on go
Ooh it's off to the races
All you've gotta do is let me know
Oh I'm ready and waiting
My heart's sittin' on go
You oughta give in now instead of resisting
'Cause I'm not above a little arm twisting
I'm bettin' it's only a matter of time
Before you and me are standing at the finish line
You're having your doubts
But you'll come around
Chorus
You're playing it safe
But baby I'll wait
Chorus
My heart's sittin' on go
My heart's sittin' on go <start> In some corner in some bar
Somewhere not too far
He's drinking scotch on the rocks
Watchin' the sweat on the glass roll off
In some corner in some bar somewhere
There's a jukebox playin' Jones
Keepin' him company bein' alone
Right where the smoke meets the neon light
He's wrestling' with a memory tonight
In some corner in some bar somewhere
Chorus
I'd love to say I'm strong enough enough
But if he put down that drink and called me up
I'd throw on my coat and be right there
In some corner in some bar somewhere
Ins one corner in the back of my heart
I know we're better bein' apart
So I say a prayer tonight he'll move on
Then I pray even harder he'll pick up the phone
In some corner in some bar somewhere
Chorus
I'd love to say I'm strong enough enough
But if he put down that drink and called me up
I'd throw on my coat and be right there
In some corner in some bar somewhere
Oh everything I love is in the chair
In some corner in some bar somewhere <start> The nighttime gets longer each morning I wake up
With sunlight that's long overdue
I start making plans for having thoughts that might take up
Some of the time that I'll spend missing you
Winters come a crawling after fall left me calling
For an end to what spring put me through
Summers only blessing had been the warm breeze caressing
All the time that I spent missing you
Minutes of misery drag through hours of memories
Past a voice that swears they're not true
It keeps avoiding denying though but mostly just lying
About the time that I'll spend missing you
Winters come a crawling after fall left me calling
For an end to what spring put me through
Summers only blessing had been the warm breeze caressing
All the time that I spent missing you <start> On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross the emblem of sufferin' and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners were slain
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it some day for a crown
 steel 
To the old rugged cross I will ever be true its shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away where his glory forever I'll share
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross... <start> I rodeoed on the circuit
For nearly fifteen years
To reach the top it took a lot
Of blood sweat and tears
I finally won the title
I finally gained the fame
But honey it don't matter
If the whole world knows my name
Of all the things I've ever done
I have to tell you true
The greatest prize I've ever won
Is the love I won from you
You stuck by me through thick and thin
Just why Lord only knows
You came along when I sang my songs
At all those country shows
And when the lights were shining
On me and me alone
You stood back in the shadows
But I want you to know
Of all the things I've ever done
I have to tell you true
The greatest prize I've ever won
Is the love I won from you
Of all the things I've ever done
I have to tell you true
The greatest prize I've ever won
Is the love I won from you <start> I know I got a bad reputation
and it isn't just talk talk talk
If I could only give you everything
You know I haven't got
I couldn't have one conversation
If it wasn't for the lies lies lies
And still I ought to tell you everything
'till I close my eyes
Suddenly I'm on the street
Seven years disappear below my feet
Been breaking down
Do you want me now
Do you want me now
Suddenly I'm down in Harold's Square
Looking in the crowd your face is everywhere
Been turning around
Do you want me now
Do you want me now
Don't try to be an inspiriation
Just wasting your time time time
You know about the best I'll ever be
See it in your eyes
I know I got a bad reputation
and it isn't just talk talk talk
If I could only give you everything
You know I haven't got
Suddenly I'm on the street
Seven years disappear below my feet
Been breaking down
Do you want me now
Do you want me now
Suddenly I'm in another place
Looking in the crowd I think I see your face
Been turning around
Do you want me now
Do you want me now

Do you want me now
Do you want me now

Do you want me now
Do you want me now

Don't you think I've heard the talk
Nobody's going to tell me who to love
Been breaking down
Do you want me now
Do you want me now
Suddenly I'm down in Harold's Square
Looking in the crowd your face is everywhere
Just turning around
Do you want me now
Do you want me now
Been breaking down
Do you want me now
Do you want me now
I'm just breaking down down down down
Been breaking down down down
Been breaking down down down <start> Granada I'm falling under your spell
And if you could speak what a fascinating tale you would tell.
Of an age the world has long forgotten.
Of an age that weaves a silent magic in Granada today.
The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada.
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wanderr along.
Entranced by the beauty before me
Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song.
And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada
I envy the blush of the snowclad Sierra Nevada.
For soon it will welcome the stars while a thousand guitars
Play a soft habanera.
Then moonlit Granada will live again the glory of yesterday
Romantic and gay. <start> I can't sleep at night for all the commotion
My heart beat the hell out of our devotion
Tied up and tied down cried out of my mind
Crazy to love you crazy still to care
Black circles under my eyes
You run circles around those other girls guys
Otherwise a woman would wake up and start a war
Why be blue anymore
Chorus
Why be blue over you
Why be blue over you

Life is too short to spend in tears
Save something sweet for the notsotender years
Try not to cry much oh when it's over
Goodbye to you and goodbye to heartache too
Chorus
Should have seen it coming should have seen the signs
Would have been better off if you'd never ever been mine
Otherwise a woman woke up and walked out the door
Why be blue anymore
Chorus x <start> You really left your mark
On this old house
And this old heart
I see you everywhere
And when I close my eyes
You're still there
And I know
You want me to move on
Start living a new life
Start writing a new song
Don't worry I ain't going to ask you
To come back and love me
Baby you don't have to
'Cause I can be in love with you without you
It's not that hard at all
It's like you're out of town
Just forgot to call
Just because you walked away
Doesn't mean my feelings have to change
Now I know
You want me to move on
Stop living an old life
Stop singing an old song
Don't worry I ain't going to ask you
To come back and love me
Baby you don't have to
'Cause I can be in love with you without you
Oh and if you're gone for good
I hope you'll go far
'Cause how I feel about you
Don't matter where you are
Yeah
And I know
You want me to move on
Start living a new life
Stop singing an old song
But I can be in love with you
No matter where you go
No matter what you do
I can be in love with you without you <start> Got a big leather suitcase all I own's inside
Seems I've been walkin' for days can't even bum a ride
Try steppin' to a tune with the rhythm of a walkin' man
Mind drifts like a big balloon out of my situation at hand
Ain't it funny how a melody can bring back a memory
Take you to another place in time
Completely change your state of mind
Walkin' down a lonely highway not feelin' alone
Thinkin' back when things went my way and not the road I'm on
Well I've been down a time or two but it never lasted long
I can always make it through on a wing and a prayer and a song
Ain't it funny how a melody can bring back a memory
Take you to another place in time
Completely change your state of mind
It can make a right from a wrong it can make you fall in love
It can get you singin' along
Chase the clouds away and make the sun shine above <start> Nashville Cats play clean as country water
Nashville Cats play wild as mountain dew
Nashville Cats been playin' since they's babies
Nashville Cats get work before they're two
Well there's thirteen hundred and fifty two
Guitar pickers in Nashville
And they can pick more notes than the number of ants
On a Tennessee anthill
Yeah there's thirteen hundred and fifty two
Guitar cases in Nashville
And any one unpacks his guitar
Can play twice better than I will
I was just thirteen you might say I was a
Musical proverbial knee high
When I heard a couple newsounding tunes on the tubes
And they blasted me sky high
Then the record man said every one is a Incomprehensible
Record from Nashville
And up north there ain't nobody buys them
And I said but I will
Nashville Cats play clean as country water
Nashville Cats play wild as mountain dew
Nashville Cats been playin' since they's babies
Nashville Cats get work before they're two
I've sixteen thousand eight hundred twenty one
Mothers from Nashville
All their friends play music and they ain't uptight
If one of the kids will
'Cause it's custom made for any mother's son
To be a guitar picker in Nashville
I sure am glad I got a chance to say a word about
The music and the mothers from Nashville
Nashville Cats play clean as country water
Nashville Cats play wild as mountain dew
Nashville Cats been playin' since they's babies
Nashville Cats get work before they're two <start> I got back in town a day before I'd planned to
I smiled and said I'll sure surprise my wife
I don't think I'll phone I'll just head on home
For I didn't know the cold hard facts of life
I passed a little wine store on the corner I pictured pink champagne by candle light
I stopped the car right then got out and hurried in
My mind not on the cold hard facts of life
A stranger stood there laughing by the counter
He said I'll take two bottles of your best
Her husband's out of town and there's a party
He winked as if to say you know the rest
I left the store two steps behind the stranger
From there to my house his car stayed in sight
But it wasn't till he turned into my drive I learned
I was witnessing the cold hard facts of life
I drove around the block till I was dizzy each time the noise came louder from within
And then I saw our bottle there beside me
And I drank a fifth of courage and walked in
Oh you should have seen their frantic faces
They screamed and cried please put away that knife
I guess I'll go to hell or rot here in the cell
But who told who the cold hard facts of life who told who the cold hard facts of life <start> It's hard to let the miles pass me by
Yellow lines that blend together in my eyes
And when the seasons change again then I will too
I just want to be closer to you
I'm staring out at endless rows of green
There are miles of hay like I have never seen
Just when you think you've had enough and
your dreams come true
I just want to be closer to you
My mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from
I tried not to let you down
Now I wonder if I've been doin' something wrong
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Tomorrow I'll be lying under you
With a heart of gold and arms to fall into
I know that there might come a day
where my life is through
But I just want to be closer to you
My mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from
I tried not to let you down
Now I wonder if I've been doin' something wrong
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Someday we might learn to tell the truth
We might even find the fountains of our youth
We all needed something real we all need proof
I just want to be closer to you
I only want to be closer to you <start> Dear mom and dad I'm writing you to say I found a job
It's a good job I don't go to work till nine
If my old car holds up I guess I'll be home for the Fourth
Don't worry bout me everything is fine
That was  where have all the seasons gone
Dear dad remember Peggy we were married Friday night
I'll bring her home to see you when I can
We took some pictures at the wedding I'll enclose the few
And the money that you wanted me to send
That was  where have all the seasons gone
Dear Uncle Ray I thank you for the Christmas card you sent
The kids enjoyed the pretty toys you bought
Congratulations awful sad that you retired last week
And that you are living in a trailer park
That was  where have all the seasons gone
Yesterday I got a letter from that oldest boy of mine
He said that he was doing fine in school
He said if his old car holds up he'll be home for the Fourth
He said don't you worry papa things are cool
That was yesterday now tell me where have all the seasons gone <start> She said I don't recall
Seeing you around here
You must be new to this town
Said I'm just passin through
But girl from the looks of you I
Could see me settling down
The she smiled and said the invitations open
Cause you look just like what I've been waiting on.
So I said why don't we take
This matter somewhere else
And get to know this feeling that's so strong
Lead on
She said I had a love once
But he just up and left me
I said I bet it broke your heart
I had a love once to but
I acted like a fool
Oh what I'd give to be back in her arms
Then she smiled and said the invitations open
Cause you look just like what I've been waiting on.
So I said why don't we take
This matter somewhere else
And pick up right where everything went wrong
Lead on <start> Well the party started early
About a quartertothree
Just a few close friends
Charlie Troy and me
We just got started when somebody asked
How long you think this party's gonna last
I said all night long 
I said all night long 
We'll be rockin' we'll be rollin'
Gonna boogiewoogie all night long
Well the next door neighbors
Started raising a fuss
Said you had a party
And you didn't call us
I said put on your dancing shoes and come along
We'll be here till the cows come home
And that's all night long 
I said all night long 
We'll be rockin' we'll be rollin'
Gonna boogiewoogie all night long

We'll be jumping through the windows
And sneaking down the halls
Dancing on the ceiling
Dancing on the wall
The last thing I remember
'fore the lights went out
I jumped up on the table and I started to shout
I said all night long 
I said all night long 
We'll be rockin' we'll be rollin'
Gonna boogiewoogie all night long

I said all night long 
I said all night long 
We'll be rockin' we'll be rollin'
Gonna boogiewoogie all night long <start> Indecision poor decisions led me to believe
That you live and you learn till you earn
Your own worst enemy
Cross my heart and hope to die
Has she got somethin' better
Misery loves company while we're in this together
All has been said and all has been done
Take a long look you were the only one
The easy way out it's a dangerous path
No one knows it like I do
And beat the door down and shatter the glass
But you better be sure what it leads to...
What it leads to...
The lash I felt from the Bible belt brought me down on my knees
When I thought that I could stand on my own two feet
Thorazine dreams and thundering and dangerous weather
And in my head I'll soon be dead or soon feelin' better
All has been said and all has been done
Takin' on the pain you were the only one
The easy way out it's a dangerous path
No one knows it like I do
Beat the door down shatter the glass
But you better be sure what it leads to...
What it leads to...
The easy way out it's a dangerous path
No one knows it like I do
When you beat the door down shatter the glass
But you better be sure what it leads to...
What it leads to...
What it leads to...
What it leads to. <start> A DAISY A DAY
Writer Jud Strunk
He remembers the first time he met 'er He remembers the first thing she said He remembers the first time he held her And the night that she came to his bed He remembers her sweet way of singin' Honey has somethin' gone wrong He remembers the fun and the teasin' And the reason he wrote 'er this song I'll give you a daisy a day dear I'll give you a daisy a day I'll love you until the rivers run still And the four winds we know blow away They would walk down the street in the evenin' And for years I would see them go by And their love that was more than the clothes that they wore Could be seen in the gleam of their eye As a kid they would take me for candy And I loved to go taggin' along We'd hold hands while we walked to the corner And the old man would sing 'er his song I'll give you a daisy a day dear I'll give you a daisy a day I'll love you until the rivers run still And the four winds we know blow away Now he walks down the street in the evenin' And he stops by the old candy store And I somehow believe he's believin' He's holdin' 'er hand like before For he feels all her love walkin' with him And he smiles at the things she might say Then the old man walks up to the hilltop And gives her a daisy a day I'll give you a daisy a day dear I'll give you a daisy a day I'll love you until the rivers run still And the four winds we know blow away <start> Burgers and fires and cherry pies it was simple and good back then
Walkin' in the sand hand in hand never thinkin' that it could end
Makin' our love with the moon above at the drivein picture show
And it was burgers and fires and cherry pies in a world we used to know
Changes come and go we've had our share I know
Now it seems we don't have time for love anymore
Oh the things we used to say little things we did each day
Oh I long to do the things that we did before
Well it was burgers and fires
Well I'm still the same ole me that's all I'll ever be
I'd like to think that you're the same ole you
We lost something down the line and I wish we both could find
Lord I'd like to do the things that we used to do
It was burgers and fires
Oh it was so simple back then <start> The summer days are gone
Along with you they disappeared
and left me here
Just like the falling leaves
I watched you turn and drift away
Nothing stays
Don't want to face the fall alone
But it's your nature to move on
Is it cold in California
Like I told you it would be
Do you need someone to warm you
Like I warmed you
Is it cold in California
Like it is in Tennessee
Spent the holidays with a man made out of snow
Ho ho ho
Kept on building fires
But they didn't ease the chill
Nothing will
This has been the hardest time
Winter has the longest nights
Is it cold in California
Like I told you it would be
Do you need someone to warm you
Like I warmed you
Is it cold in California
Like it is in Tennessee <start> Sometimes when I am lonely I get to thinking bout the places that I've been
I turn around in the same old direction once again I'm going home on a midnight train
When I left you was the middle of the winter
The ground was covered by a cold cold snow
My heart was young and I was searching but in vain I'm going home on a midnight train
Home is not just a place where you are living
Home means more when you've got no place to go
And when you're down and need someone to stand beside you
Turn around and go on home
When you're down and need someone... <start> A calloused right hand
Holds a shiny gold watch
For thirty rears spent on the clock
But you won't see no tears
From this working class hero
He's always been hard as a rock
But he knows he's too old
To really start over
Besides he just wouldn't know how
I guess he's just glad
That he's not alone
But he's got to wonder what now
There's no hall of fame for that working class hero
No statues carved out of stone
And his greatest reward is the love of a woman
And his children
So after he's gone
That old working class hero lives on
Well that threebedroom house
He build in the 's
Seems so much bigger today
With just him and mama
And not many bills
'Cause all of the kids moved away
What he's done with his life
Might not be remembered
But he's got every right to be proud
'Cause the blood sweatin' years
Of this workin' class hero
Is really what livin's about
'Cause there's no hall of fame for that working class hero
No statues carved out of stone
And his greatest reward is the love of a worman
And his children
So after he's gone
That old working class hero lives on
Yea that working class hero lives on <start> Buy yourself a cottage with a picket fence around
High upon the hilltop a few miles out from town
Wrap yourself in loneliness and try to have a ball
You'll find you gotta have love you gotta have love or you've got nothing at all
Buy yourself a new car and go out for a ride
Drive along a lover's lane with no one by your side
Keep on saying to your heart I've ever gonna fall
You'll find you gotta have love you gotta have love or you've got nothing at all
Go asleep and dream about the plans you'd like to make
But there's no fun if there's no one to share them when you awake
Buy yourself a ticket to London or to Rome
You'll find there's no difference that if you'd stay at home
Every town is just the same when you've no one to call
You'll find you gotta have love you gotta have love or you've got nothing at all
 you gotta have love or you've got nothing at all <start> Why the day you were born girl
Your mom and I named you Tanya Montana
I just thought you should know
Your eyes were
As blue as the skies of Montana
Your skin was
As white as fresh falling snow
Tanya Montana is some thing to see
A dream that came true for your mother and me
A small piece of Heaven on earth as they say
But Tanya Montana is so far away
Why some day you're gonna grow up
And you're gonna leave us sweet Tanya
And some man will steal you
Some man's gonna steal you away I know
But you know me and your momma
Why we love you Montana
Lord it's going to break our hearts
When we see you go
Tanya Montana has been on my mind
Like the eagles that fly above reaching the light
Searching for freedom you'll find it some day
And then Tanya Montana will be so far away <start> All my life I've traveled o'er the country I've even flown and sailed across the sea
Name of famous bridge ah I betcha that I've crossed
And all the women that I've loved have all crossed me
That's the one bridge that I have never crossed everything I ever loved I always lost
For the true love I'd gladly pay the cost
But that's the one bridge I have never crossed
 dobro 
I've made a lot of money in my lifetime
I've got a million friends ah I know some envy me
But nobody know how bad I need affection
And how I long to find the love that won't cross me
That's the one bridge...
 dobro 
That's the one bridge... <start> It only hurts for a little while
That's what they tell me that's what they say
It only hurts for a little while
Then all your heartaches will pass away
It's so easy to be smart with somebody else's heart
But I don't know how to start forgetting you what can I do
It only hurts for a little while
That's what they tell me just wait and see
But I will hurt till you come back to me
It's so easy to be smart
 <start> Fare to Midland is all that I need
If I had fair to Midland I'd take the first seat
On a fast train bus or plane
Which ever proved the quickest way for me
I left her in Midland near one last promise
I couldn't keep
To chase a future paved with fools
Small county roads don't ever reach
But for every cloudless mile the sun has shone
There's been a hundred nights alone at least
The shame is how it took so long
To figure out fare to Midland don't come cheap
My eyes keep lonely thoughts reminding me
With every dusty truck that I see
I'm only closer to how far away can be
And all the time that's left is an eternity
Now to make myself west Texas bound
The fare to Midland is all I need
Fare to Midland is all that I need
If I had fare to Midland I'd take the first seat <start> When you find yourself
In some far off place
And it causes you
To rethink some things
You start to sense
That slowly you're becoming someone else
And then you find yourself
When you make new friends
In a brand new town
And you start to think
About settling down
The things that would have been lost on you
Are now clear as a bell
And you find yourself
That's when you find yourself
Well you go through life
So sure of where you're heading
And you wind up lost
And it's the best thing that could happen
'Cause sometimes when you lose your way
It's really just as well
'Cause you find yourself
That when you find yourself
When you meet the one
You've been waiting for
And she's everything
That you want and more
You look at her
And you finally start
To live for someone else
And then you find yourself
That's when you find yourself <start> The night is getting on the band is getting show
The crowd is almost gone and here we are still dancin'
Nothing to do but waltz
Our feet can barely move my legs are yellin'Whoa
But we're in such a groove that love is still advancin'
Nothing to do but waltz
You can't suggest that we could go on Jitterbuggin'
We've nothing left for moves more strenuous than huggin'
But we don't need much room to gently cut a rug in we two
I'm tired and out of juice and yet from head to toe
My body's feeling loose and warm and kind of supple
Nothing to do but waltz
The minutes slip away my arms just won't let go
I think I'd like to stay 'til we're the only couple
Nothing to do but waltz
You never know how far this sort of thing will get you
We're not as tired as we would like to think I bet you
You'd stay up half the night with me if I would let you
So come let the waltz play again <start> All the time yes darling all the time
Through the years through smiles or tears I'll love you
Every day I'll prove it every way
Through the years through smiles or tears I'll love you
Other arms may tempt me but don't let that bother you
For even if they tempt me I'll never be untrue
All the time yes darling all the time
Through the years through smiles or tears I'll love you
Other arms may tempt me... <start> I don't want nobody
I'm better off alone
I'm sworn to independence
My heart is made of stone
But you're breakin' on through
Oh there's something 'bout you
I've been tapping my toes
To the way you talk
And I've been singin' along
To the way you walk
I've got to do
Something 'bout you
Well I've got this place of mine
It's nice and quiet and I like it fine
I work real hard got no time for you
But I've whiskied up my coffee cup
Sittin' here tryin' not to call you up
It's gettin' to where I don't know what to do
Oh there's something 'bout you
Somethin' about you like distant thunder
And I can't say I ain't been warned
But there's no shelter to crawl under
Ever gonna save me from this storm
Oh there's something 'bout you
That I can't shake
There's somethin' 'bout you
That's been keeping me awake
The whole night through
Oh there's something 'bout you
Well I've got this life of mine
It's nice and quiet and I like it fine
I work real hard got no time for you
But I've whiskied up my coffee cup
Sittin' here tryin' not to call you up
It's gettin' to where I don't know what to do
Oh there's something 'bout you
Babe something 'bout you <start> Have you ever been down to a country dance
And listend to the music of a hillbilly band
And danced with your darlin' all through the night
And don't go home til the morning light
Well if you ain't you don't know what your missing
Laughter and dancin' a huggin' and a kissin'
Everybody there's just havin' a ball
A dancin' all night at the old Grange Hall
The people they come from miles around
The ranchers farmers folks from town
There's bald headed men and old fat women
Kids in their teens and little bitty children
So put on your boots and stomp on the floor
And have more fun than ever before
Man we're really havin' a ball
A dancin' all night at the old Grange Hall
Well the sun's comin' up and it's time to go home
The band they're playin' that final song
Everyone's leavin' and sayin' good night
But you're lookin' forward to next Saturday night
So put on your boots...
So put on your boots... <start> Oh it's cryin' time again you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time
Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
But my love for you could never grow no stronger
If I lived to be a hundred years old
Oh it's cryin' time again you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time
Now you say you've found someone that you love better
That's the way it's happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow
Cryin' time will start when you walk out the door <start> DADDY WAS AN OLD TIME PREACHER MAN

Daddy was an old time preacher man
He preached the word of God throughout the land
He praeached so plain a child could understand
Yes daddy was an old time preacher man
He told the people of the need to pray
He talked about God's wrath on Judgement Day
He preached about that great eternity
He breathed hell so hot that you could feel the heat
Daddy was an old time preacher man and Leona would get up to testify
As we'd sing in the sweet by and by then we'd sing I'm on my way to Canaan's
Land
Yes daddy was an old time preacher man
Revivals and camps meeting's with four weeks
Folks came from all around to hear him preach
Daddy said if one is saved it's worth it all
But the aisles were all we stilled in altar call
Daddy was an old time preacher man...
Daddy worked for God but asked no pay for he believed that God provides away
We never had a lot but we got by
I guess it's cause the Lord was on my daddy's side
Yes daddy was an old time preacher man
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore
I'm on my way to Canaan's Land yes daddy was an old time preacher man
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore
I'm on my way to Canaan's Land yes daddy was an old time preacher man <start> You can tell that I'm a big man in this town
And I'm the king of every street that I walk down
It ain't much to brag about but it's all mine
From main street to the city limits sign.
Welcome to rock bottom population 
Just over by the mountain where a fool fell from
And if you're looking for heartaches stop and get you some
Down in rock bottom population .
When I said goodbye to her I felt so strong
I thought I knew my way but somewhere I went wrong
Now I'd trade this lonesome world to hold her near
But I don't think she could reach me way down here. <start> I know there is no honor for ones like her and me
But should there ever be a place for broken hearts to weep
And should there be a kingdom for those who break the rules
They'll crown her queen unfaithful and me the king of fools
Queen unfaithful and king of fools
That's what they'll call us in that place the devil rules
I put all my faith in her and she broke all the rules
They'll crown her queen unfaithful and me the king of fools
 piano 
I know there are no prizes for the biggest lie
And there's no wealth or fame for those who's heart is taught to cry
But should there be a kingdom with a castle for two
They'll crown her queen unfaithful and me the king of fools
Queen unfaithful... <start> Oh
The cruel war is raging Johnny has to fight
And I long to be with him from morning till night
I long to be with him it grieves my heart so
Won't you let me come with you
No my love no
Tomorrow is Sunday Monday is the day
Your captain will call you and you must obey
Your captain will call you it grieves my heart so
Won't you let me come with you
No my love no no no my love no
No no my love no
But I could tie back my hair men's clothing I'll put on
And I could march as your comrade as we go along
I could pass as your comrade no one will ever know
Won't you let me come with you
No my love no
Now Johnny oh Johnny I feel that you are unkind
You know I love you far better than all of mankind
Yes I love you far better than words could ever express
Please won't you let me come with you
Yes yes my love yes
Oh yes yes yes <start> Hear that lonesome whippoorwill he sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low I'm so lonesome I could cry
I've never seen a night so long when time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind a cloud to hide its face and cry
Did you ever see a robin weep when leaves began to die
That means he's lost the will to live I'm so lonesome I could cry
The silence of a falling star lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are I'm so lonesome I could cry
I'm so lonesome I could cry <start> Raeleen wheeler was the first girl I loved
Through the last year of high school we were thicker than blood
Holed up in Mississippi and starvin' for fun
We made love and dreamed up places to run
I was burnin' that summer with the big dreams I had
And the songs I'd written well the world needed bad
But a pretty girl needs more comfort and gold
Than a beatup black notebook is likely to hold
Hey Raelene it's a wide world between pearl river and the bright L.A. lights
And if I'd done it all without dreamin' I'd still be in Jackson tonight
Hollywood hopefuls ain't an endangered breed
But luck is like lightnin' and it sure struck me
The hit songs the women the standingroom halls
And twenty years of hard labor holdin' on to it all
Louisiana i headed east from Monroe
A bus bound for Jackson and a homecoming show
Staring through the dark glass at the flat miles beyond
Tryin' not to look at a face that is gone
Hey Raelene a wife at  but I heard you made out all right
And every now and again I wonder are you somewhere in Jackson tonight
Well we killed 'em we crushed 'em burned the place to the ground
And in the dressing room quiet I was still coming down
When in the doorway appeared an old flame fullgrown
Looking pretty as ever and entirely alone
She said the divorce nearly broke her she was learning to stand
And as she talked it came clearer that she wanted a hand
So I drew her close to me and I kissed my sweet rae
And the miles and the memories just melted away
Then I glanced in the mirror and in a split second's time
Just before recognizing that old face as mine
I saw a strange sad man in a cheap rhinestone shirt
And a woman he held onto like his last hope on earth
He was worn and trod down as the road he'd been on
And his eyes were halfdead lookin' too hard too long
His life measured in nights that flashed and grew dim
Leaving no one really happy least of all him
Then the loading gate slammed and I let my arms fall
We traded numbers small talk promised to call
And as she faded from me and the night closed around
I picked up a black notebook and I let it spill down
Hey Raelene it's a long way between the wantin' and the makin' it right
And if I was the one that you needed I'd never leave Jackson tonight
 yeah if I had it all to do over I'd still be in Jackson tonight <start> Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again
What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I've cried
I guess I should have known the worst was yet to come
And the crying time for me had just begun
Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again
Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again <start> Somethin' 'bout the way she's wearing her dress a little tighter
Somethin' 'bout the way she's starin'she's lookin' to start a fire
Somethin' 'bout the way she's dancin' and drinkin' chilled patron
If she's lonely now she won't be lonely long
Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It's too late too bad she's too far gone
He should've thought of that before he left her all alone
If she's lonely now she won't be lonely long
Somethin' 'bout the way she's blushin'you can tell she isn't sure
Let you know she's up to something she's never done before
Tonight she wants to hold a stranger but not the one at home
If she's lonely now she won't be lonely long
Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It's too late too bad she's too far gone
He should've thought of that before he left her all alone
If she's lonely now she won't be lonely long
If I had a woman like that
Man I'd let her know
I'd hold her tight
I'd hold her close
Do anything do everything to let her know
She'd never ever be alone
Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It's too late too bad she's too far gone
He should've thought of that before he left her all alone
If she's lonely now Lord if she's lonely now
If she's lonely now she won't be lonely long <start> Sweetest surrender of winter
She put up her flag it is waving
The thunder of summer is rumbling in
And I haven't seen you in days
And my how that feeling has changed
Oh I have been homesick for you since we met
I have been homesick for you
I've got to take to the sky
And I'll tell you what that means for you and I
If I die it's for you
If I die it's for you
I never lived 'til I lived in your light
And my heart never beat like it does at the sight
Of you baby blue God blessed your life
I do not live 'less I live in your light
I do not live 'less I live in your light
The realest thing I ever felt
Was the blood on the floor and the love in your yell
I was a child before
The day that I met Eleanor
Kiss of the wind in the hills
The clearness of morning the late evening thrill
Blurry and gray like the roar
The wheels on the highway above them I soar
When I'm in the sweet daughter's eyes
My heart is now ruined for the rest of all time
There's no part of it left to give
There's no part of it left to give
I never lived 'til I lived in your light
And my heart never beat like it does at the sight
Of you baby blue God blessed your life
I do not live 'less I live in your light
I do not live 'less I live in your light
I do not live <start> Judy your breakfast was good I'd have me some more if I could
Your biscuits and love have filled me your beautiful presents sustill me
You're treatin' me just like a king I know what teardrop will bring
That's kind of a comforting thing
But sometimes I wish I was thumbin' my way back to Denver
With nothin' to bother my mind and nothin' ahead but blue sky highway and time
Your shutters you keep closed up tight you iron my shirts about right
The coffee and cake that you bring me
The songs and the rhymes that you sing me are nice
But once in a while I wish you'd forget how to smile
And though you really treat me in style
But sometimes I wish...
Sometimes I wish... <start> I am a man I am self aware
And everywhere I go
You're always right there with me
I flirted with you all my life
Even kissed you once or twice
And to this day I swear it was nice but clearly
I was not ready
When you touched a friend of mine
I thought I would lose my mind
But I found out with time that
Really I was not ready
Oh death oh death oh death
Really I'm not ready
Oh death you enter me
Death's unmade those dear to me
And tease me with your sweet relief
You're cruel and you are constant
When my mom was cancer sick
She fought but then succumbed to it
But you made her beg for it
Lord Jesus please I'm ready
Oh death oh death oh death
Really I'm not ready
Oh death oh death oh death
Clearly I'm not ready <start> We shared the same last name and the same color eyes
But we fought like tigers over that old red bike
I'm battin' first and you can't use my glove
It wouldn't take long 'til push came to shove
But we looked out for each other with Brotherly Love
You hated girls 'til I had my first date
I brought her home from the movies you stayed up late
Three on the couch watchin' T.V.
I was smilin' at her while you were laughin' at me
But I wouldn't trade it for nothin' Brotherly Love
Chorus
There's a bond that brothers know
And it gets stronger as they grow
A love that time and miles can't come between
We disagreed but in the end
There will never be two closer friends
And Brotherly Love is something we all need.
They share the same last name and the same color eyes
But they fight like tigers over one ol' red bike
And lookin' at them reminds me of us
They're gonna fight and they're gonna fuss
But they got something special it's Brotherly Love <start> There are times I stand in wonder
To look at you and all you are
And I think I can unlock the mystery
Break through your walls and win your heart
I don't mean to scare you
There's no need to be afraid
We can take our time
But I'll take my chance and say
Let me love you really love you
Open up your heart and let me in
I don't know who taught you not to trust
I'll be constant as the sun that shines above
Close your eyes and take the fall
If it's really love there's no risk at all
I can love you if you'll only let me in
I see your strength and how you shine
You're a diamond in the rough that should be mine
But you're still fighting an old old war
That's left you wounded and left you scarred
You hide your weakness
Behind those walls
You think it's your own secret
But in your eyes I see it all
Let me love you really love you
Open up your heart and let me in
I don't know who taught you not to trust
I'll be constant as the sun that shines above
Close your eyes and take the fall
If it's really love there's no risk at all
Lay down your past and then you can begin
To let me love you really love you
I can love you if you'll only let me in <start> When God dips His love in my heart
When God dips His pen of love in my heart
And He writes my soul a message He wants me to know
His spirit all divine fills a sinful soul of mine
When God dips His love in my heart
Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul
How He brought salvation and He made me whole
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart
Well He made me laugh and He made me cry set my sinful soul on fire
Hallelujah when God dips His love in my heart in my heart
Well sometimes though the way is dreary dark and cold
And some unburdened sorrow keeps me from the goal
I go to God in prayer I can always find Him there
To whisper sweet peace to my soul
Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul
How He brought salvation and He made me whole
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart
Well He made me laugh and He made me cry set my sinful soul on fire
Hallelujah when God dips His love in my heart
He walked up every step of Calvary's rugged way
And He gave his life completely to bring a better day
My life was steeped in sin but in love He took me in
His blood washed away every stain
I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul
How He brought salvation and He made me whole
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart
He made me laugh and He made me cry set my sinful soul on fire
Hallelujah when God dips His love in my heart
Hallelujah when God dips His love His sweet love in my heart <start> Little swallow please take wing and bring her to me
Bring back the one I'm longing to see
Little swallow please take wing and bring her to me
Bring back my true love to me
Little swallow when I mended your wing so long ago
You said that come a day you'd bring the sun my way
Little swallow now I need a friend a friend who will be true
Please say you'll see me through I'm depending on you
Little swallow please take wing...
 guitar 
Little swallow please take wing...
Bring back my true love to me <start> God made man and then God made a woman he never meant for them to turn out bad
And then inside he placed a heart for beating and Lord what a beating mine's had
Scattered pieces of my heart lay all around me
Each one filled with hurt from love it almost had
How much longer can what's left go on beating cause Lord what a beating mine's had
A heart born to lose and never win
But each beat of my heart gives me strength to try again
How much longer can what's left go on beating cause Lord what a beating mine's had
Cause Lord what a beating mine's had <start> I came here because I knew I'd be welcome
And because somehow you always understand
You seem to have a way with lonely people
And you always were my greatest helping hand
Chorus
Now once again I'm here to take advantage
Though I don't deserve the arms I left alone
I need to know there's someone who still loves me
And I need a shoulder to cry on
I over looked the love you tried so hard to give
The love I never seem to understand
I always stay just long enough to hurt you
And what little love I gave was second hand
Chorus <start> Well I was born akickin lord and bound to die the same
Son of a son of a man on the run reared on raisin cain
Mama put lead in my boots to keep me on the ground
But once I heard that highway call couldn't nothing hold me down.
Cause I'm on a wild ride full stride I've let go of the reins
I get off on getting out of control
Baby I've got a raging fire running through my veins
I just can't seem to take it slow
Oh cause life gets better I know
The faster I go
Well people call me crazy why'all just because I'm young
But I ain't gonna waste one night till my days are done
Full speed down the track forget about the brakes
If you don't want to get on board then you'd best get outta my way
Cause I'm on a wild ride full stride I've let go of the reins
I get off on getting out of control
Baby I've got a raging fire running through my veins
I just can't seem to take it slow
Oh cause life gets better I know
The faster I go <start> You've got my attention
In every dimension
You've made a deep impression
On my heart tonight
Looks can be deceiving
But what I've been receiving
Has got me believing
Now the time is right
To tell you
I've got to tell you
Chorus
I think I love you
I know I need you
I really want you
I have to see you
On a steady basis
That smile on your face says
You feel it too
I think I love you
It's a win win situation
I'm way beyond elation
Full of fascination
For you here in my arms
So I've made a life decision
I'm on a one way mission
To bring this to fruition
And give you my heart
I'll show you
Baby I'll show you
Chorus <start> I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead
Made you wait 'til our wedding night
That's the first and the last time I wear white
So if the ties that bind ever do come loose
Tie them in a knot like a hangman's noose
'Cause I'll go to heaven or I'll go to hell
Before I'll see you with someone else
Put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say
Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two
Well
It won't be whiskey won't be meth
It'll be your name on my last breath
If divorce or death ever do us part
The coroner will call it a broken heart
So put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say
Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two
Dig two
Ooh ooh
I took your name when I took those vows
I meant 'em back then and I mean 'em right now
Oh right now
If the ties that bind ever do come loose
If forever ever ends for you
If that ring gets a little too tight
You might as well read me my last rights
And let the stone say
Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
Gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig uh
Heavy stone right next to mine
We'll be together 'til the end of time
Don't you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two
I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead <start> They just don't make love like they used to they stone a heart that's warm and true
It seems to fall apart no matter what we do
They just don't make love like they used to
Love just don't hold on like it used to it dies before it's halfway through
And it seems to fall apart no matter what we do
They just don't make love like they used to
I remember when I loved you meant all the world
They just don't make love like they used to
 strings 
It seems to fall apart no matter what we do
They just don't make love like they used to
I remember when I loved you...
They just don't make love like they used to <start> There's something talkin' in the wind
Whispering through the trees
That feeling in my bones again
Just puts me right at ease
It takes me back to all the times
I' ve been here before
But crossroads old familiar signs
Tell me there's something more
Can't explain there's something strange about the early fall
It's comfort leaving me without a care
I remain but everything around me hears the call
And tonight I feel a change in the air
The leaves are turning soon they'll fall
There's a norther blowing in
The memories flowin' I recall
Those changes in the wind
But I can never try to understand
There's nothing you can hold in your hand
Can't explain there's something strange about the early fall
It's comfort leaving me without a care
I remain but everything around me hears the call
And tonight I feel a change in the air
Yes I'll surely feel a change in the air <start> Oh oh oh oh
Oh yeah
That's it man
Okay baby yeah
Aha
Play it on
Aah good song
Yeah <start> He's threefeet tall and four years old
An' still believes that I can do no wrong
When I get home at five o'clock
He's waitin' with that Cowboys jersey on
I laugh 'cause he's just like his Dad
He'll miss the ball an' he'll get mad
Thinks when he grows up he'll catch 'em all
Then I get down on my knees an' tell him
Sometimes even Daddies drop the ball
Chorus
It's times like these that I realize
They don't stay little long
You blink your eyes an' turn around
Before you know it they're grown up an' gone
I've been takin' time for granted
Now I'm gonna take advantage of every golden opportunity
Make the most of every moment
While we still have times like these
I could go to work this Saturday
Lord knows that I could use the overtime
But I'll be sittin' there behind home plate
Cheerin' on that little man of mine
Yeah the extra pay would sure be nice
But it's worth any sacrifice
To see my little slugger's first at bat
An' when he looks up in the stands an' sees me
Man you can't put a price on that
Chorus
I been takin' time for granted
Now I'm gonna take advantage of every golden opportunity
Make the most of every moment
While we still have times like these
I've been takin' time for granted
Now I'm gonna take advantage of every golden opportunity
Make the most of every moment
While we still have times like these
Thank God for times like these <start> I'll love you enough for both of us till you decide just how you feel
You're still not sure if you love me or not so I'll love you enough for both of us
I hope in time you'll find that I'm your every dream come true
A spark within your heart may start to glow
But then again it just might end it could be this way too
Whatever happens I want you to know
I'll love you enough for both of us alway remember how I feel
I'll wait around until you know for sure and I'll love you enough for both of us
I'll love you enough for both of us <start> Stoke up the fire mom bake me a pie stick a big chicken in the skillet to fry
Bake me some biscuits a chocolate cake too I'm comin' home mom home to see you
Well it's been a long time now since I've been away I've been rodeoin' for many a day
Now I'm returnin' no more to be blue I'm comin' home mom home to see you
I met me a lady as sweet as can be I asked her to marry she said yes siree
No more to be lonely no more to be blue
Now were comin' home mom home to see you
I met me a lady... <start> I'll love you forever and a day that's what the love songs like to say
In love it seems life is but a dream when we started out it felt that way
But it didn't take us very long to find out the world is not a song
Life gets blue and love does too you learn to forgive and just go on
Maybe that's all it takes just lettin' go of the old mistakes
Holdin' on tight to the love we make maybe that's all it takes
 piano 
We've done our share of slamming doors and wondering what we're together for
Yes we've been through a tear or two and for every tear I'll love you more
And maybe that's all it takes...
Maybe that's all it takes... <start> Somewhere in our hearts
Somewhere deep inside
lives a dream
thats worth dreaming
Every now and then
I get a glimpse of where
he and I could fly
but you an I
share
One dream
One hope
we're heading down the same road
even though we dont know where it leads
we follow
the same star
I'm in love like you are
until he reaches out for you or me
we share
one dream
I imagined what would be
magical place is
waiting for me
its still out there
our vision is the same
even though the world through
different eyes
you and I
share
One dream
One hope
we're heading down the same road
even though we dont know where it leads
we follow
the same star
im in love like you are
till he reaches out for you or me
we share
one dream
One dream
One hope
we're heading down the same road
even though we dont know where it leads
we follow
the same star
im in love like you are
till he reaches out for you or me
we share
one dream
one dream <start> Won't you please let me go
These words lie inside they hurt me so
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you
Just what I want to do
I'm not the kind that needs to tell you
Just what you want me to
I saw you this morning I thought that you might like to know
I received your message in full a few days ago
I understood every word that it said
And now that I've actually heard it you're going to regret
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you
Just what you want me to
You're not the kind that needs to tell me
About the birds and the bees
Do you find this happens all the time
Crucial point one day becomes a crime
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you
Just what I want to do
I'm not the kind that needs to tell you
I've lost you I've lost you I've lost you
I've lost you I've lost you
I've lost you I've lost you I've lost you
I've lost you I've lost you
I've lost you I've lost you I've lost you
I've lost you I've lost you <start> Don't be fooled by my words
Don't be fooled by my song
If you choose to belive them
You'll plainly be wrong
I have love for my family
I have love for my friends
That's as far as it goes
And I must let you know
My love for you was pretend.
Pretend love pretend love
Don't be mistaken I've only been fakin'
Pretend love
Don't you know I've a gift
And I've wraped it in truth
Your birthday's tomorrow
But the gift is not for you
But if I came with a present
I would bring you a clue
Hopes you'd finally see
That your feelings for me
Will never be returned
Pretend love pretend love
Don't be mistaken I've only been fakin'
Pretend love
Pretend love pretend love
Don't be mistaken I've only been faking
Pretend love <start> How do you spell relief

I do it almost every day
It's the only thing that I've found
That'll take the hurt away
Well how do you spell relief John

Every night about sundown

This old broken heart acts up
There's a hurtin' in my pride
Well I've found a sure fire treatment
That'll get me feelin' right
When your memory starts flarin' up
I just head for the neon lights
How do you spell relief David
I get DRUNK
Lately since my baby left

It's the only thing that I've found John
That'll take the hurt away
Well how do you spell relief
I just get DRUNK
John Hartford
I don't need no doctor
To tell me what is wrong
I can fill my own prescriptions
And it lasts me all night long
It's the perfect medication
For an ailment such as mine
I forget about the tears I've cried
When the whiskey hits my mind
How do we spell relief
We get DRUNK
Lately since my baby left me
I do it almost every day
Well I tell ya Johnny
Its the only thing I've found
That'll take the pain away
How do we spell relief
We get DRUNK

We're havin' fun now ain't we <start> Good mornin' mornin' glory
Good mornin' what's your story
Good mornin' where'd you spend the night
Where did your night dreams take you
Sorry but I had to wake you
Oh I just had to make you
Shed your precious mornin' light on me
Oh good mornin' sleepy baby
You know I'm thinking maybe
I love you even more today
Every time you go to sleep
I'm jealous of the dreams
That keep you away from me
Good mornin' mornin' glory
I'll have to thank the sandman
For he's let you wake up in my arms again
Doo doo da doo doo doo doo <start> All the gold in California
Is in the bank in the middle of Beverly Hills
In somebody else's name.
So if you're dreamin' about California
It don't matter at all where you've played before.
California's a brandnew game.
Tryin' to be a hero winding up a zero
Can scar a man forever right down to your soul.
Living on the spotlight can kill a man outright
'Cause everything that glitters is not gold.
All the gold in California
Is in the bank in the middle of Beverly Hills
In somebody else's name.
So if you're dreamin' about California
It don't matter at all where you've played before.
California's a brandnew game. <start> Way down in Georgia
Way down in Rome
Come around the mornin'
I'll be headed home
Goin' to the mountains
of the Carolines
I'll get there before the sun falls
Behind the tallest pine
Pine tree pine tree
Growin' from the soil of Gallilee
Don't be scared now don't be slow
If you don't go the roots won't grow
When I was a child there
Three feet I stood
I looked out on the valley
And dreamed the dreams I could
As the years passed by
My shadow grew so tall
No steps could I take
Afraid that I would fall
Pine tree pine tree
Growin' from the soil of Gallilee
Don't be scared now don't be slow
If you don't go the roots won't grow
Well through the darkest rainfall
I have been kept dry
A steady hand has guided me me
To the other side
When my dying day comes
Bury me beside
The tallest of the pine trees
In the hills of Caroline
Pine tree pine tree
Growin' from the soil of Gallilee
Don't be scared now don't be slow
If you don't go the roots won't grow
If you don't go the roots won't grow
Pine tree pine tree
Growin' from the soil of Gallilee
Don't be scared now don't be slow
If you don't go the roots won't grow <start> Every Friday night I go to bubba's hardware store
And give the secret knock on the private stockroom door
Good ol' boys are shootin craps playin' five card stud
Hot lookin' women
Ice cold suds
This blonde was playin' poker
She was on a roll
I sat down beside her with my ace in the hole
I had to draw a jack to win
With a straight ace high
But win I drew that card
I kissed that pot goodbye
cause I'm one jack off
Here in my hand
I got an ace a king a queen and a ten and
Now I'm in a jam
I was doin' fine till I pulled that nine
That's win I went soft
I was temptin' fate with an ace high stright
But I'm one jack off
I've played with this deck so long its messin' with my mind
I've heard it said to much of this it can make a man go blind
I can't let her beat me but I ain't got a prayer
I'm sure she's got a real good hand
I see she's got a pair
I stared across the table
Hopin' that she calls
Then when she raised me
Well I dang near lost it all
I tried to pull it out figurin' Id bluff
But win I showed her what I had
She said to bad your one jack off
I'm just one jack off
Ain't that great
She said nice try but nine ten queen king ace don't make a straight
I said how about another round
She said adie up there hoss
She took all my money
And I'm still one jack off
I'm one jack off
Just my luck
She won my favorite pair of cowboy boots
And the pink slip to my truck
I knew Id have to come again next week
To get back what I lost
That's the story of my life
Its seems I'm always one jack off
That's right
One jack off <start> All we need is a July hot Saturday night
A couple cans all cool and the needle on full and a countryside
Yeah a hot little playlist every favorite songs
When I get you climbing up in the cab of this truck
Yeah you know it's on know it's on
Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heating it up behind a high beam
Ooh baby you and me just arunning down crazy
Flying high living careless on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night
So give me that aw yeah and take me there look
I'm a sucker for your kiss wanna steal 'em from your lips baby like a truck
Foot heavy on the floorboard everywhere we go
I'm talking once in a lifetime blowing your mind
Burning down these back roads
Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heating it up behind a high beam
Ooh baby you and me just arunning down crazy
Flying high living careless on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night
So give me that aw yeah and I'll give you that all night
Girl give me that let's go and I'll give you that good good time
Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heating it up behind a high beam
Ooh baby you and me just arunning down crazy
Flying high living careless on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night
Yeah a once in a lifetime night
Ooh girl looking down the ride of one hell of a night
I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night <start> Way down at the bottom of the river
There's a locket with a picture of me
She drowned what I thought was forever
She locked up our love and lost the key
A friend of mine heard from a friend of hers
She was workin' on last name number three
There was a time I'd have relished those words
But I'm not where I used to be
Way down weighted down at the bottom
I almost drown in a shallow dream
A light shined down and life was waiting at the top
When I let go of the past that was draggin' me
Way down on an Oklahoma highway
There's a cafe where they'll remember me
I broke down by a pay phone in the hallway
Put my fist through a drywall sheet
I hit a wall trying to find some kinda way
To find some peace
Buried it all when I dug a grave
For all the pain that was pulling me
Way down weighted down at the bottom
I almost drown in a shallow dream
A light shined down and life was waiting at the top
When I let go of the past that was dragging me way down
Way down way down way down
Way down way down way down <start> i don't wanna ask too much
be too bold
i dont wanna weigh you down
with a heavy load
ive heard you say that you can handle anything
but what i really need to know is
would you wait for me
when i gotta leave
could i ever be everything you need
if i promise you my love
could that promise be enough
oh would you wait for me
would you wait for me
i dont need a magic night
too make me feel
like im living in a fairytale
i know this love is real
and hear me when i say
that when ever im away
my heart is with you
all the same
but would you wait for me
when i gotta leave
could i ever be everything you need
and if i promise you my love
could that promise be enough
oh would you wait for me
would you wait for me
and looking back at where weve been
me being scared to let you in
to you becoming my best friend
no matter where i travel to
im coming right back home to you
if you'll just wait for me
would you wait for me
when i gotta leave
could i ever be everything you need
if i promise you my love
could that promise be enough
would you wait for me
yeah would you wait for me
when i gotta leave
could i ever be everything you need
if i promise you my love
could that promise be enough
would you wait for me
would you wait for me
would you wait for me <start> I don't want to tie you down
With some lines spoken in sorrow
With some hopes pinned on tomorrow
You've got your bedroll and your guitar
And there you are
Ready to be alone rolling stone
I don't want the phone to ring
I can't talk when I'm crying
Your voice shakes when you're lying
Saddle the wind and ride for the sun
The way you run
You'll never have a home rolling stone
But if you don't love what you've found
Just remember the world is round
And whatever rolls away
Can always roll back home some day
When you sleep beneath the sky
With your coat making your pillow
As the wind cries on the willows
And your bed holds no tenderness
Remember this
You made it on your own rolling stone roll on <start> WRITER PAT McLAUGHLIN
They got a road out in Alaska now
I hear that you can go there.
Tell me about Montana
With the cool blue mountain air.
I know your honeys got the money
I can understand your wanderlust.
Brother and boy for me these days
Its refrigerator or bust.
I ain't got no words for going
I got no longing for your open road.
Don't get found rollin' into town tugging on a heavy load.
You've gotta give me the nights with the city lights and the people buzzin' everywhere.
One hand upon the parking meter the other on her easy chair.
I'll send her roses send her roses everyday.
If I don't go down another dirt road I don't think it's gonna hurt my day.
I'll send her roses send her roses once in awhile.
I'm a long long way from outta here but you know I'm gonna go in style.
Well I was rollin' around Boston town wasn't hardly anybody I know.
Got to singin' low for the first three rows puttin' on a lousy show.
Well then I met her I had to let her buy my lunch I got the flowery plate.
I'm telling you why good brother don't laugh think I got me one suitable mate.
I'll send her roses send her roses every day.
If I don't go down another dirt road I don't think it's gonna hurt my day.
I'll send her roses send her roses by the dozen.
I've been having me a whirl with a pretty girl
And she told me she liked my lovin'.
 <start> There's a tangled mess of sheets on the bed
A lack of sleep poundin' in my head
We both regret some of the things we said
But we love the way it ends
Sometimes I think
We hurt each other just because where it'll lead
Sometimes I think
We're fighting just to be lovers and all so needlessly
Good as we are at gettin' it on
How come we just can't get along
The way we love it don't seem right
The way we fuss the way we fight
I got a crazy idea how 'bout maybe tonight
We make up without a fight
They say don't go to bed angry that's true
But it's really something when we do

Girl I admit
Sometimes I think
It couldn't be any better

And sometimes I think
We don't belong together
Confusing love and war
Good as we are at gettin' it on
How come we just can't get along
The way we love it don't seem right
The way we fuss the way we fight
I got a crazy idea how 'bout maybe tonight
We make up without a fight
We ain't givin' up without a fight
We can make up without a fight

Good as we are at gettin' it on
How 'bout maybe tonight
We make up without a fight <start> Way down in Columbus Georgia
Lord I wish I was back in Tennessee
Way down in that old Columbus Stockade
My friends all have turned their back on me.
Go and leave me if you wish to
Never let me cross your mind
In your heart you love another
Leave me little darling I don't mind
Many a night with you I've rambled
Honey countless hours with you I've spent
Thought I had your sweet love and your little heart forever
But I find it was only lent.
Go and leave me if you wish to
Never let me cross your mind
If in your heart you love another
Leave me little darling I don't mind
Last night as I lay sleeping
Oh I dreamd that I was you in my arms
When I woke I was mistaken
Lord I was still behind these bars
Go and leave me if you wish to
Never let me cross your mind
If in your heart you love another
Leave me little darling I don't mind
Lord I've got the walking blues <start> By the rivers of Babylon there we sat down
Yeah we wept when we remembered Zion
By the rivers of Babylon there we sat down
Yeah we wept when we remembered Zion.
When the wicked
Carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
Now how shall we sing the lord's song in a strange land
When the wicked
Carried us away in captivity
Requiring of us a song
Now how shall we sing the lord's song in a strange land
Let the words of our mouth and the meditations of our heart
Be acceptable in thy sight here tonight
Let the words of our mouth and the meditation of our hearts
Be acceptable in thy sight here tonight
By the rivers of Babylon there we sat down
Yeah we wept when we remembered Zion
By the rivers of Babylon there we sat down
Yeah we wept when we remembered Zion.
By the rivers of Babylon 
There we sat down 
Yeah we wept 
When we remember Zion. 
By the rivers of Babylon 
There we sat down 
Yeah we wept 
When we remember Zion.  <start> I've never had a face you'd notice
The world never took much notice of me
I've never been good at conversation
I was too busy tripping on my own feet
I've never had grand illusions
Love was always for someone else
But in a world so few surprises
There's still a few surprises left
Ain't it amazing that miracles happen
Ain't it amazing you can still find your dream
Ain't it amazing it all comes true
When someone like you can happen to someone like me
So hold me now so warm beside you
Let me stay forever near
Sometimes I think I'm only dreaming
But I wake up you're still here <start> You know that after the laughter comes the tears
That's what happens when your memory appears
I try to act real happy since you said goodbye
But sometimes when I least expect I break right down and cry
Cause always after the laughter comes the tears
And my feelings never seem to be too clear
I never know how long I'll smile but it's usually just for a little while
Cause after the laughter comes the tears
After the laughter comes the tears... <start> Well won't you lend your lungs to me Mine are collapsing
Plant my feet and bitterly breathe up the time that's passing
Breath I'll take and breath I'll give and pray the day's not poison
Stand among the ones that live in lonely indecision
Fingers walk the darkness down mind is on the midnight
Gather up the gold you've found you fool it's only moonlight
And if you try to take it home your hands will turn to butter
You better leave this dream alone try to find another
Salvation sat and crossed herself and called The Devil partner
Wisdom burned upon a shelf who'll kill the raging cancer
Seal the river at it's mouth take the water prisoner
Fill the skies with screams and cries bathe in fiery answers
Jesus was an only son and love his only concept
Strangers talk in foreign tongues and dirty up the doorstep
And I for one and you for two ain't got time for outside
Just keep your injured looks to you we'll tell the world we tried
Keep your injured looks to you we'll tell the world we tried <start> Lord bless your children who walk in perfection who manage to Master your will
Give them their share of sweet milk and wild honey
Provide bread of life 'till they're filled
Feed the children but give me the crumbs from the table
I'll wait for them down on my knees
I'd be ever so grateful for the crumbs from the table
For strength needed to follow Thee
Lord I'm not worthy to eat from the platter cause I'm just a beggar in need
So satisfy others but when they're all finished dear Jesus have mercy on me
Feed the children
For strength needed to follow Thee <start> On the hillside so lonely knelt Jesus one day
So wounded and worried he went there to pray
My friends there forsaken so lonely he feels
To heaven he's crying in helpless up here
But the golden day has broken in old Gethsemane
The mourner orphans singing the songs of victory
There's a new highway to glory the road that Jesus try
With a halo we're traveling the pathway too far
 steel 
On the hillside in garden such suffering I see
In humble submission he'll make honest plea
His blood streams of thirsty comes sinner be true
His cheeks are all crimson for me and for you
But the golden day has broken... <start> 
I woke up early this mornin'
An' I'm already runnin' late
There's a list of things long as my arm
I won't get dont today
Is it Tuesday Is it Wednesday
They're runnin' into each other
Somebody tell me when is my day
Man this life is sure bein' a mother
Chorus
So tomorrow I'm takin' me fishin'
Hang a sign on the door of my life
Tell the world that I've gone missin'
An' I won't be back for a while
I'm so tired of only wishin'
I could leave my troubles behind
I wanna be front porch rockin'
With a big sun droppin' in a blue sky
Kick back an' get high
On the livin' part of life

They say to keep your spot on the ladder
An' keep that money rollin' in
They say keepin' up with the feelies boy
You can't back off one inch
But I been puttin' in my time
An' I've built up a pretty good deal
I'm gonna spend some maybe waste some
Before my time comes an' I wind up dead
Yeah tomorrow I'm takin' me fishin'
Hang a sign on the door of my life
Tell the world that I've gone missin'
An' I won't be back for a while
I'm so tired of only wishin'
I could leave my troubles behind
I wanna be front porch rockin'
With a big sun droppin' in a blue sky
Kick back an' get high
On the livin' part of life

When I get home tonight
I'll open the window an' let whatever roll in
An' if there's no breeze that's cool with me
I'll just raise myself an' wait on the wind yeah
Correction above I'll just raise my sail an' wait on the wind
Yeah tomorrow I'm takin' me fishin'
Hang a sign on the door of my life
Tell the world that I've gone missin'
An' I won't be back for a while
I'm so tired of only wishin'
I could leave my troubles behind
I wanna be front porch rockin'
With a big sun droppin' in a blue sky
Kick back an' get high
Kick back an' get high
On the livin' part of life

I got a talkin' baby doll for Cindy I got a pair o'roller skates for Jane
And baby if we ever have any more kiss Christmas shoppin's gonna drive me insane
Gonna go this Christmas shopping well I wonder if I'll ever get through
I tried to get everybody somethin' that they wanted
But I didn't know what to get you
I read the kids letters to Santa Claus I read 'em over one by one
And I surely like to get my hands on the fella that said Christmas shoppin's fun
I got ten toy soldiers
Well I must've walked a hundred miles or more I went to every store in town
My feet started swellin' and my head started achin'
And I couldn't find a place to sit down
But to tell you the truth well I really don't mind it I could even walk another mile
Cause on Christmas mornin' when they open up the presents
Well it's worth it just to see them smile
I got ten toy soldiers <start> AFRAID TO LIVE AND AFRAID OF DYING

WRITER PORTER WAGONER
They say most anything you eat could hurt your health
Be careful what you drink don't harm yourself
And pollution in the air might make you sick
Makes you afraid to live afraid that you might die too quick
Do the men that quote this danger really know
Life is gift to be enjoyed and not to worry so
The biggest danger sign that we should know
Make sure we're right with God as through this world we go
We're afraid to live 'cause we're afraid of dyin'
And afraid to love the one we love afraid they might be lyin'
We can't enjoy life when they say each thing might bring an early grave
We're afraid to live 'cause we're afraid of dyin'
Do the men that quote this danger really know
Life is gift to be enjoyed why worry so
The biggest danger sign that we should know
Make sure we're right with God as through this world we go
Make sure we're right with God as through this world we go <start> Tell them other girl don't bother.
'Cause come hell or high water
You're the only one for me.
If they can't see I'm faithfully devoted to you
Well then they don't have a clue.
'Cause girl I'm a juggernaut and I'll never stop loving you.
Baby when we get to fightin'
You can take your love and hide it.
You can rage into the night
When you're ready I'll be right here waiting for you.
Baby my love is true
I'll be your juggernaut yeah I'll never stop loving you.
When you're weak nearly broken
When it's hard to keep on hoping
Baby I won't break or bend.
Yeah the only way this ends is with you in my arms.
With you in my arms.
And I'm not saying maybe I'm telling you baby
I'll never leave your side.
You're my once and always bride
The love of my life my beautiful wife.
And I'm just a juggernaut but I'll never stop loving you. <start> DON'T MAKE ME DREAM

' Southern Nights Music
I can't believe you're at my door again
You hurt me once I shouldn't let you in
I know you'll always find the way back to my heart
So I'm begging you before you make me start
Don't make me dream if dreaming can't come true
Don't make me dream if I can't have you
Don't make me mad don't make me cry
Don't stay a while then say goodbye
Don't touch the feelings we once knew
Don't make me dream if dreaming can't come true
There was a time I lived to feel your touch
I never knew goodbye could hurt so much
But I still see some magic in your eyes
So don't come back and tell those same sweet lies
Don't make me dream if dreaming can't come true...
Don't make me dream if dreaming can't come true... <start> If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishin' well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me.
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost you can't see.
If I could read your mind love
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind the drugstore sell
When you reach the part
Where the heartaches come
The hero would be me
Heroes often fail
And you won't need that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take.
I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a freeway script
Enter number two
A movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me
But for now love let's be real
I never thought I could act this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelin's gone and I just can't get it back.
If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishin' well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
The story always ends
And if you read between the lines
You'll know that I'm just tryin' to understand
The feelings that you lack
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it.
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelin's gone and I just can't get it back... <start> Pat Green
We were just dumb kids
With a sixpack
That a bad fake ID bought
Sittin' on the living room couch
Hopin' that we didn't get caught
Brad Paisley
And when we did
My dad
Had some good advice for me
He said son there's a time and place
For just about everything
It's called college
Brad Paisley
Next thing I know
I'm packin' up
And hey I'm out of here
A back seat full of clothes
In my old Cavalier
Pat Green
There was empty
Pizza boxes
Stacked up around the room
A couple of beers on a Tuesday
And one in the afternoon
Hey college
Chorus 
Brad Paisley
Those were the best days of my life
I found my friends myself and my wife
Pat Green
I learned almost everything that I know
Without ever gainin' knowledge
Brad Paisley
In college
Both
Yeah yeah yeah

In college
Both
Yeah yeah yeah
Brad Paisley
I had such a good time
In those four years
That I stretched it into six
Pat Green
And I'd like to thank Ole George's Bar
For the classes that I missed
Brad Paisley
I was searchin'
For the meaning of life
When I saw her walk my way
Pat Green
And there wasn't no doubt in my mind
That it wasn't 'bout a GPA

In college <start> It amazes me how she can change my mind
When it seems to be impossible she can do it everytime
And the way she always loves me she's got that down perfect too
I keep asking myself what is it the lady can't do
She brightens any room she walks inside
And the way she comes in smiling you'd never think she ever cries
She still looks as young and pretty as she did the day we met
If there's one thing bad about her I ain't found it yet
What it is my woman can't do can't be done
If there's ever been a darling I've got one
She beats all I've ever seen she's the champion of our team
What my woman can't do can't be done what my woman can't do can't be done <start> 
I don't know when I've ever been so crazy mixedup and blue
Wanting you wanting you
You've gone your way and I've gone mine why I must go on
Wanting you wanting you
My friends all think I'm feelin' fine they don't know this heart of mine
Keeps on crying all the time for you
I'll try to find somebody new I guess I'll try too soon
Cause I'm still blue and still wanting you
 piano 
My friends all think... <start> As blue skies and daylight darken into night
Surrounding us with beauty as the stars make their light
They spell out our names all the stars up above
As they flicker and shine like letters of love
Then a warm breath of air whispers through the trees
As the leaves on their branches have blown to the breeze
Ripples of water seemed to echo the sound
Love's out tonight there's love all around
Small drops of dew act as nature's perfume
Placing its fragrance on all that's in blue
While I hold you so close your lips touching mine
With nature all around us watching our love entwine
Love's out tonight see the candles in the sky
God lend us the heavens tonight for you and I
A night full of love for all the world to see
Love's out tonight all around you and me
Love's out tonight <start> Yes I know 'fore you go I'm gonna miss you
A good piece of ass is hard to find
Before you leave home go out on your own
I just
Like to fuck you one more time
One more time
I'd like to stick my pecker in you
Even if it's just a quickie
I won't mind
No I won't get your new white dress dirty baby
I just
Like to fuck you one more time
There is no need to cry 'cause you're leavin'
Your mother and me we ain't blind
We both knew someday you'll go on your way
And I just
Like to fuck you one more time
One more time
I'd like to stick my pecker in you
Even if it's just a quickie
I won't mind
No I won't get your new white dress dirty baby
I just
Like to fuck you one more time
Heaven knows that you've been a good daughter baby
And I just
Like to fuck you one more time
Lord I love even you call me dirty
And I just
Like to fuck you one more time
One more time <start> Have I Told You Lately That I Love You
Have I told you lately that I love you
Could I tell you once again somehow
Have I said with all my heart and soul
How I adore you
Well darling I'm telling you now
Chorus
My world would end without a memory of you
I'm no good without you anyhow
Oh have I told you lately that I love you
Well darling I'm telling you now
Have I told you lately how I miss you
When the stars are shining in the sky
Have I told you why the nights are long
When you're not with me
Well darling I'm telling you now
Have I told you lately when I'm sleeping
E
very dream I dream is you somehow
Have I told you that I'd like to share
Your love forever
Well darling I'm telling you now
Chorus <start> I been wired since I can't remember when
You seen me out most every night with a dissipated grin
All my life I been been ribald loose and loud now I think I'm finally wearin' down
I may rock and I may roll I may sleep out in the cold
I can still stay up six days in a row
But I know the things I do don't compare with the things I did
If you think I'm crazy now should've seen me when I was a kid
I been wild I been wasted stoned and stooped
Stayed out nights and started fights and wore out two bar stools
All these years it's been bedrooms bars and beers
But now the end is finally drawin' near
I may rock and and may roll <start> Instrumental <start> My transistor radio comes from far away
And when it's night over here over there it's a breakin day
I remember all the good times I had a walkin in the sand
With the beautiful girl that I met made in Japan
The beauty of her face was beyond my wildest dreams
Like cherry blossoms moving in the mountain in the early spring
As we walked by the river and she softly took hold of my hand
That's when I fell deep in love with the girl made in Japan
In the dark of night we would lay on Tokoy Bay
And the singin of the birds woke us up at the break of day
Her smiling eyes always seemed to try to understand
All the love in my heart for the girl made in Japan
My transistor radio comes from far away
And when it's night over here over there it's a breakin day
She cried when she said she'd been promised to another man
That's when I left my heart with the girl made in Japan
Yes my heart will always be with the girl made in Japan. <start> Hey good girl
With your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you
What you're thinkin' about
You'll see a good boy
Gonna give you the world
But he's gonna leave you cryin'
With your heart in the dirt
His lips are dripping honey
But he'll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your loving
Go and throw away the key
Hey good girl
Get out while you can
I know you think you got a good man
Why why you gotta be so blind
Won't you open up your eyes
It's just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good girl
No good for you
You better get to getting on your goodbye shoes and go go go
Better listen to me
He's low low low
Hey good girl
You got a heart of gold
You want a white wedding
And a hand you can hold
Just like you should girl
Like every good girl does
Want a fairytale ending somebody to love
But he's really good at lying
Yeah he'll leave you in the dust
'Cause when he says forever
Well it don't mean much
Hey good girl
So good for him
Better back away honey
You don't know where he's been
Why why you gotta be so blind
Won't you open up your eyes
It's just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good girl
No good for you
You better get to getting on your goodbye shoes and go go go
Yeah yeah yeah he's low
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh he's no good girl
Why can't you see
He'll take your heart and break it
Listen to me yeah
Why why you gotta be so blind
Won't you open up your eyes
It's just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good he's no good
Won't you open up your eyes
It's just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good girl
No good for you
You better get to getting on your goodbye shoes <start> Given up on traveling'
It's driving me insane
Riding alone on a midnight train
Now a mind can wonder and that's far from being free
'Cause when that lonesome sunset whistle blows
This is where I'll be
I hopped a westbound for San Antone
From there to Santa Fe
And It's a thousand miles from there to home
And there's a thousand things to say
About a man bound to ramble
And a dream he's got to lose
That'll break this fever set him free
And bring him home to you
Somewhere I slipped off track
But the world keeps going by
But there never was a train
That couldn't try
There'll be nobody waiting
My goodbyes are too long gone
From that moment at the station
When I left from right to wrong
But now I finally nearly made it
It was a long uphill climb
To right back to where I started from
But I think I can this time
Somewhere I slipped off track
But the world keeps going by
But there never was a train
That couldn't try
Somewhere I slipped off track
I was thinking I could fly
But there never was a train
That couldn't try <start> I can live in a mansion or a doublewide
Eat sushi raw or my catfish fried
Wherever I am then that's where I belong
'Cause I'm quite content with who I am
And if you ain't well kiss my ham
Country is as country does and I'm country to the bone
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
It's the way I always will be that's for sure
Country born and country bred
Countrified and countryfed
A country heart and a country head
'Cause I'm country to the core
Now I can drive a tractor or a Cadillac
I can fly first class or slum in the back
But I'll be the same ol' gal when I arrive
Oh I can wear denim or I can wear silk
Drink champagne or chocolate milk
Take the best or live with less 'cause a country girl survives
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
And the way I'll be until they lay me low
Country born and country bred
I'm countrified and I'm countryfed
And I'll be that way 'til I'm country dead
'Cause I'm country head to toe
And what you see is what you get
Nothing's ever changed me yet
Nothing will it's a pretty safe bet
'Cause I'm country through and through
Oh that's country
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
It's the way I'll be until my dying day
I'm country born and country bred
Countrified and countryfed
And nothing done and nothing said can change my country ways
Nothing done and nothing said
Nothing's gonna change my country ways
I don't think so
Wouldn't change if I could
Country is as country does
It's the way I is and it's the way I was
Country born and country bred
I'm countrified and I'm countryfed you know that
I'm country 
But now that don't mean I can't go to town <start> Just outside there waiting.
Just outside the circle.
Waiting for that finger to point your way.
Just keep running. Just keep running.
New ones quickly burning.
Old ones die away.
Fires lit to say goodbye or hello.
Which way you looking Which way you looking
Count all wounds that brought you here.
Lay your blessings end to end.
Rid yourself of all regrets
Because here is where it all begins.
A bumbler's game a cheaters wheel
Where the winner pays the highest cost.
You've laid your marker now watch the ball.
Hold your breath its about to fall.
Just outside there waiting.
Just outside the circle.
Waiting there is someone i don't know who.
I'm so open i'm so open.
I don't sleep most nights
Just lie awake and count my blessings.
I'll take this endless life
Of perfect pointless mornings.
I'll hold you till the morning comes
'Cause it's all that i can do.
I'm so open. I'm so open.
I don't like these last goodbyes.
I don't like goodbyes. <start> Chorus
Bartenders barstools and barmaids
A jukebox and a pocketful of change
Just a few of my favorite things
Bartenders barstools and barmaids
Bartenders listen when you talk
Barstools are there when you can't walk
And I'll always make a waitress my best friend
Until the music stops and closin' time begins
Chorus
Outside lies a heart that's been broke
But in here it's a world of song and smoke
That way my eyes and ears can lie to me
While I drink another shot of make believe
Chorus
Bartenders barstools and barmaids <start> You said youd go just for a year
and i watched the tail lights dissappear your words like old foot prints upon my mind.
yeah your family all was gone
but you couldnt imagine leaving long
you said you only get your life for this one time.
but what do i recall when the world was all
but changing in the mirror while im standin like an old stop sign.
Yeah courage said the man
when you see your whole life turnin out nothin like you'd ever seen or planned.
He said There's always another day and anyhow that's the only way
It's better just to learn that while you can.
Well would she stay or would she go
With a girl like that you never know.
What's goin on in her heart is hard to define
But I'm inclined to say Virginia guess you made up your mind.
WEll you taught me how to dance and what it is to take a chance.
Theres learning and theres doing its not the same.
Yeah I held when you cried on the morning that your daddy died
if you're livin you heard theres no one to blame
in hell i do alright but theres times that i cant sleep at night
and i think about things i didnt know stayed with me all this time
but im inclined to say Virginia guess you made up your mind.
Yeah years go by and you dont come home at all or write
or call or tell me what you did or didnt find...
Yeah the young girl that i married and the babies that she carried
are the stars my whole world just turns around
and i guess shes just like me and she didnt care to much to see
what life was like outside our little town
Yeah mornings there are some where i wonder if i've chosen anything that
I've ever done before in my whole life.
But thats all behind me now.
Virginia guess you made up  I'm inclined to say Virginia guess you made up 
I dont mind to say Virginia guess you made up your mind. <start> Hallways and staircases everyday to climb
To go up to my white walled room out on the end of time
Where I can be with my love for she is all that is mine
And she'll always be there my love don't care about time
I laugh with her cry with her hold her close she is mine
The way she tells me of her love and never is she trying
She don't have to be assured of many good things to find
And she'll always be there my love don't care about time
Her eyes are dark and deep with love her hair hangs long and fine
She walks with ease and all she sees is never wrong or right
And with her arms around me tight I see her all in my mind
And she'll always be there my love don't care about time <start> Oh hard is the fortune of all womankind
They're always controlled they're always confined
Controlled by their parents until they are wives
Then slaves to their husbands the rest of their lives
I am a poor girl my fortune is sad
I've always been courted by the wagoner's lad
He's courted me daily by night and by day
And now he is loaded and going away
Your parents don't like me because I am poor
They say I'm not worthy of entering your door
I work for my living my money's my own
And if they don't like me they can leave me alone
Your horses are hungry go feed them some hay
Come sit down beside me as long as you may
My horses ain't hungry they won't eat your hay
So fare thee well darling I'll be on my way <start> This is the night
We'll come to the surface
And pledge our vows to ourselves
I'll pour my clean words over your hair
And slide close into the stones
Oh my captain
I'm a bear rider
On an open plain
I'm a hungry tiger
In a kitten suit
My ducky i'm just like you
And as the night
Crawls into its embers
We'll beach ourselves along the shore
We'll hold our gazes into the hours
And drink our glasses down
Oh my capture
I'm a naked rider
On an open plain
I'm a mountain climber
And in all i see
My ducky you're just for me <start> Written by billy burnette and rafe van hoy.
Love me back
Love me back I gave you all my lovin'
And that was that
Now I'm out here on a limb that's about to crack

 I'm stuck out here in love with you
Love me back love me back
I gave you all my love
You know that's a fact
I'm out here on a wire
That's about to snap
So baby won't you love me back
I'm drifting on an ocean
Deep in misery
With just a sea of blue
Between you and me
So love me back
Love me back
Love me back I gave you all of my lovin'
And that was that
Now I'm out here on a limb that's about to crack



Ride ride ride on into town there's a honky tonk gal a waitin'
And I've got troubles to drown

Ride ride ride on into town

Well there's a place down Kentucky
Said right down near Ohio
You can watch the planes at night
People line up to watch each flight
I said awatchin' them planes
Well I wish I was on one
Sittin' here thinkin' 'bout my crazy dream
If I could only see him tonight
Oh Atlanta Oh Atlanta
Whoah whoah Atlanta
Got to get back to you
You can drop me off on Peachtree
I got to feel that Georgia sun
And the people in Atlanta
They make you awful glad you come
I said awatchin' them planes
Well I wish I was on one
Sittin' here thinkin' 'bout my crazy dream
If I could only see him tonight
Oh Atlanta Oh Atlanta
Whoah whoah Atlanta
Got to get back to you
We'll go down just you and me
Where the music plays all night
They've got the boogie band playin' that's bound for hell
When they get to movin' they never stop
They just keep on playin' that down home beat

Yeah I wish I was on one
Sittin' here thinkin' 'bout my crazy dream
If I could only see him tonight <start> Don't your conscience ever bother you everytime you hear my name
Tryin' to think of all that I've gone through and hang your head in shame
Someone came along and took my place then you gave me all the blame
You should go somewhere and hide your face and hang your head in shame
When you said I was the only one wanted just your little game
Now look back at all the harm you've done and hang your head in shame
You don't miss me since we've been apart I wish that I would say the same
Think of how you broke my trusting heart and hang your head in shame <start> You've been acting funny lately
What's up with you
You clam up or you just talk crazy
Flippin' mood to mood
If you think that I don't care
you're missing something
If you think there's nothing there
you're wrong.
Chorus
It's all in your mind
Psyching you out
feeding you lines
Your heart must be blind
If you can't see the light in my eyes
You can't look inside me
but if you could you'd find
it's all in your mind
There's nothing wrong
with second guessing
or being sensitive
I love you
I'm confessing
if I forget to mention it
If you think that's how it is
that my hearts not here with you
And I've nothing more to give
well I do
Chorus
It's all in your mind
Psyching you out
feeding you lines
Your heart must be blind
If you can't see the light in my eyes
You can't look inside me
but if you could you'd find
it's all in your mind
Imagination is taking you there.
Chorus
It's all in your mind
Psyching you out
feeding you lines
Your heart must be blind
If you can't see the light in my eyes
You can't look inside me
but if you could you'd find
it's all in your mind <start> Qualquer dia
Qualquer hora
A gente se encontra
Seja a onde for

Qualquer dia
Qualquer hora

Seja a onde for
Pra falar de amor
Pra matar a saudade
Da felicidade
Dos instantes
Que juntos passamos
E promessas juramos
Reviver os momentos
De sonho e de paixo

Meu meu amor <start> Lips are you ready to tremble hands
Are you ready to shake
Eyes get ready to cry heart
Get ready to break
Here she comes now she's getting closer
Is everyone ready to start
Altogether now let's fall apart
Nerves you'll be going to pieces
Tears you'll stream down my face
Head you'll be spinning around
It's time everyone take your place
We're all in this thing together
My body my mind and my heart
Altogether now let's fall apart
I couldn't keep her from leaving
Though I tried oh Lord I tried
But heart you let me cheat
Then lips you went and lied
Here she comes now she's getting closer
Does everyone remember his part
Altogether now let's fall apart
Altogether now let's fall apart <start> Heaven knows where I'd be now
If you had not found me.
On that road that takes a man
To places he's not meant to be.
I wasn't ready for the touch
That turned my life around.
Now I'm helpless in your hands
It's love that ties me down.
Angel of no mercy
Girl you take my breath away.
And it feels so good it hurts me
To think that you might fly away.
Can't you see that I've surrendered
You stole this old heart blind.
You're an angel of no mercy
But I don't mind.
Ain't it strange how love can take
A heart that's hard as steel
Hold it tightly in the fire
And teach that cold heart how to feel.
Touch me now I'm still not sure
You're truly flesh and bone.
Heaven knows you can't be from
This world that I live on.
Angel of no mercy
Girl you take my breath away.
And it feels so good it hurts me
To think that you might fly away.
Can't you see that I've surrendered
You stole this old heart blind.
You're an angel of no mercy
But I don't mind.
Can't you see that I've surrendered
You stole this old heart blind.
You're an angel of no mercy
But I don't mind. <start> Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday
Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday
Oh I believe in yesterday <start> Somewhere there should be for all the world to see
A statue of a fool made of stone
An image of a man who let love slip through his hands
And then just let him stand there all alone
And there on his face a gold tear should be placed
To honor the million tears he cried
And the hurt in his eyes would so everyone would know
Concealed is a broken heart inside
So build a statue and oh build it high so that all can see
Then inscribe the World's Greatest Fool and name it after me <start> If you listen I'll sing you a sweet little song
Of a flower that's now dropped and dead
Yet dearer to me yes than all of its mates
Though each holds aloft its proud head.
Twas given to me by a girl that I know
Since we've met faith I've known no repose.
She is dearer by far than the world's brightest star
And I call her my wild Irish Rose.
My wild Irish Rose the sweetest flower that grows.
You may search everywhere but none can compare with my wild Irish Rose.
My wild Irish Rose the dearest flower that grows
And some day for my sake she may let me take the bloom from my wild Irish Rose.
They may sing of their rose which by other names
Would smell just as sweetly they say.
But I know that my Rose would never consent
To have that sweet name taken away.
Her glances are shy when e'er I pass by
The bower where my true love grows
And my one wish has been that some day I may win
The heart of my wild Irish Rose.
My wild Irish Rose the sweetest flower that grows.
You may search everywhere but none can compare with my wild Irish Rose.
My wild Irish Rose the dearest flower that grows
And some day for my sake she may let me take the bloom from my wild Irish Rose. <start> Don't expect a twirl
She's not that kind of girl
She reserves the right to be sullen
In a purple mood
Yeah she still thinks it's cool
So don't even try to tell her nothin'
Ooh she ain't gonna let you in
Fool she ain't ever gonna break her
Rule and if you try you're just another
Fool
She can feel your stare
And knows you're standing there
Waiting for a chance to win her favor
But she just sips her wine
As you get in line
With all of the others trying to save her
Ooh she ain't gonna let you in
Fool she ain't ever gonna break her
Rule and if you try you're just another
Fool
I know it's hard to resist
The taste of her kiss
But remember this
She won't let down her guard no matter what you do
Ooh she ain't gonna let you in
Fool she ain't ever gonna break her
Rule and if you try you're just another
Fool <start> 
Say forever you'll be mine
Forever is the love that is filled with understanding
Forever is the love that is true and undemanding
Forever is the love that can stand the test of time
Forever I am yours say forever you'll be mine
Trouble clouds may fill our skies
It might even rain awhile
But the rain will go away
There's always a brighter day
Darling I won't promise you
That we'll be happy all the time
But forever I am yours say forever you'll be mine
Forever I am yours say forever you'll be mine
Say forever you'll be mine forever I am yours
And I'll do anything that you ever ask me to
And I'll do what you want me to <start> I look out across corn rows from a dirt road
Baby's kicked back in the front seat
Got her bare fit hanging out the window
We take a trip down memory lane
Dirt on the truck no chance of rain
My third generation farming friends all pray that its on the way
And if it don't show up we'll be alright
Because folks round here wouldn't take a million
For a different life
Chorus
Home sweet home
I thank my lucky stars at night
I was raised down here and raised up right
And my pride you've got that right
Home sweet home
Where a little bit goes long way
And we shut her down on sundays
I wont ever get too far away
From Home sweet home
Pull down to the cane bridge
Park in the ditch
Folks and poles are lined up
A little kid holds a stringer up
Got a mess of fish
I drive away with a smile on my face
Knowing that this place is blessed
By God's amazing grace
Chorus
Know matter I go
Or where the road might leave
This little speck on the map will always be
Chorus
Yeah I'm coming home. <start> Love can grow in the strangest places
Might find love in strangers faces.
Find it on a mountain top or in a valley low
Love can grow where you least expect it
Nurtured by a kiss or a tear that wets it
Love will grow if one just lets it
Let love grow.
I know you have feelings for me too
But you're afraid to try to love again.
I know your heart is true
I'll do my best to prove
That I'll be here for you
Please say you'll let me in.
Love can grow in the strangest places
Might find love in strangers faces.
Find it on a mountain top or in a valley low
Love can grow where you least expect it
Take and chance and don't reject it.
Love will grow if one just lets it
Let love grow.
If I could I'd ease your doubts for good
I'd put your heart at ease
Just don't give up.
What do you say we try
And go that extra mile
What chance that you and I
Find love we're worthy of.

Look for love and let it find you

Love is out there for the making.

Daddy on guitar pickin' Wildwood Flower
Old record player spinnin' LP's
Yeah that's music to me
Reel screamin' large mouth on the line
Georgia breeze whistlin' through the pines
Mama hollerin' y'all let's eat
Yeah that's music to me
Soaked in the whiskey and washed in the blood
That's who I am and what I love
Saturday nights full of Haggard and Whitley
A Sunday morning choir now that's music to me
High school football when the home team scores
Little bare feet on a hardwood floor
Hearin' her whisper the kids are asleep
Now that's music to me
Soaked in the whiskey and washed in the blood
That's who I am and what I love
Saturday nights full of Haggard and Whitley
A Sunday morning choir now that's music to me
Soaked in the whiskey and washed in the blood
That's who I am and what I love
A ho down fiddle a little off key
Old hound dog ahowlin yeah that's music to me
Yeah that's music to me <start> I called you today an accidental mistake
And your name slipped out to some friends
Forgotten old feelings are brand new today
'Cause I'm right back where I've always been
You're just an old love turned memory
Now I seldom see you around
You're just an old love turned memory
But you still turn my world upside down
I went to some places where I knew you'd be
Just to prove our love was over and done
But the moment my eyes met yours
I knew my sorrow had only begun
You're just an old love turned memory
Now I seldom see you around
You're just an old love turned memory
But you still turn my world upside down <start> All of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am
But these stories don't mean anything
When you've got no one to tell them to
It's true I was made for you
I climbed across the mountain tops
Swam all across the ocean blue
I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules
But baby I broke them all for you
Oh because even when I was flat broke
You made me feel like a million bucks
You do
I was made for you
For you
You see the smile that's on my mouth
It's hiding the words that don't come out
And all of my friends who think that I'm blessed
They don't know my head is a mess
No they don't know who I really am
And they don't know what
I've been through like you do
And I was made for you
And all of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am
But these stories don't mean anything
When you've got no one to tell them to
It's true I was made for you
It's true that I was made for you <start> It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried upon some line
That keeps you on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
Oh but not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' caldron in some train yard
My beard a rustling a cold towel
A dirty hat pulled low across my face 
Through cupped hands 'round the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waiting from the back roads
By the rivers of my memories
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind
Gentle on my mind
You are gentle on my mind <start> I walk through my front door
She's right there like the day before
Saying Daddy please play with me
Right there in the living room
In a ponytail and ballet shoes
I spin her 'round she says out loud
I wish this song would last forever
Dance baby dance
I don't ever wanna leave this moment
Dance baby dance
'Cause right now I know I'm the only one
Baby dance dance baby dance baby dance
And one day she'll pack up to leave
She'll kiss her mom and then kiss me
And say Goodbye Dad are you alright
I'll just smile and tell her yes
And try to hide this big old mess
Inside my heart as she starts the car
That's why I wish this song would last forever
Dance baby dance
I don't ever wanna leave this moment
Dance baby dance
'Cause right now I know I'm the only one
Baby dance dance baby dance baby dance
And I know there's gonna come a time
When she'll be there all dressed in white
And I'll take her hand for one last dance
Dance baby dance
I don't ever wanna leave this moment
Dance baby dance
'Cause right now I know I'm the only one
Baby dance
I don't ever wanna leave this moment
Dance baby dance
'Cause right now I know I'm the only one
Baby dance dance baby dance baby dance
Baby dance <start> The old home town looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my Mama and Papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to meet me
Arms reaching smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Then I awake and look around me
At four gray walls that surround me
And I realize yes I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre
On and on we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green green grass of home <start> Leaves were falling just like embers
In colors red and gold they set us on fire
Burning just like moonbeams in our eyes.
Chorus
Somebody said they saw me swinging the world by the tail
Bouncing over a white cloud killing the blues.
Now I'm guilty of something...
I hope you never do
Because there is nothing
Sadder than losing yourself in love.
Chorus
Now you've ask me... just to leave you
To go out on my own
And get what I need to.
You want me to find what I've already had.
Chorus x <start> Oh there you are all alone at the bar
Heaven knows you're something to see
And so I say hi try out my best lie
You cross your long legs and smile back at me
Oh you say I'm nice you say I'm sweet
Well baby I must have you fooled
'Cause I know damn well they could put me in jail
for what I been thinkin' 'bout you

I could get twenty years for what's goin' on here
Honey right inside of my head
If society knew what I'm doing to you
I'm sure they'd make me pay my debt
Any jury would find it's a terrible crime
They'd do what they had to do
Yeah I know damn well they could put me in jail
for what I been thinkin' 'bout you
I say 'Tell me love do you come in here much'
You say 'Oh from time to time'
Yeah I'm talking to you but while I do
a whole lot of things are going on in my mind
Oh I try to hide what I'm thinking inside
'Cause if anybody ever knew
Yeah I know damn well they could put me jail
for what I been thinkin' 'bout you

Yeah I know damn well they could put me jail
for what I been thinkin' 'bout you <start> Just got back from Paris France
All they do is sing and dance
All they got is romance
What a tragedy
Every boulevard has lovers
Every lover's in a trance
The poor people of Paris
I feel sorry for the French
Every guy has got a wench
Every couple's got a bench kissing shamelessly
Night and day they're making music
While they're making love in French
The poor people of Paris
Milk or water from a sink
Make a true Parisian shrink
Wine is all he'll ever drink
And it worries me
For with wine as cheap as water
Oh it makes one stop and think
The poor people of Paris
Sister Madam Pierre
Had the craziest love affair
And the day after they parted there
He cries bitterly
Pierre was there to bid her farewell
But he brought his new girl Claire
The poor people of Paris
So don't go to Paris France
Not unless you like to dance
Not unless you want romance
Like those poor inhabitants of Paris
Spoken
In the meantime I got to hurry back there
I think I forgot something... <start> That voice you hear inside is just your conscience
Why do you bother me why can't you let me be
It's all your fault you know why did you hurt me so
I tried to play it smart I broke my baby's heart
That voice you hear my dear is just your conscience
Each time I think I'm free a voice inside of me
Whisper soft and low why don't you let go
I just can't break away it's with me night and day
That voice you hear inside is just your conscience
Why do you bother me
That voice you hear my dear is just your conscience
That voice you hear my dear is just your conscience <start> NOT TILL YOU COME BACK TO ME

When will the mountains sing again the valleys ring again
Not till you come back to me
When will the roses grow again the rivers flow again
Not till you come back to me
Not till you come back and say you need me
And love me like you loved me once before
Until you kiss my lips I'll see no sunshine
Until you hold me close I'll smile no more
When will the grass turn green again the air feel clean again
Not till you come back to me
Not till you come back and say...
When will my arms run dry again no eyes will cry again
Not till you come back to me not till you come back to me <start> She lays awake
In a silent room
Holding his picture
Washed sliver by the moon
Oceans away
He feels her sigh
So alone
In the world tonight
Freedom needs a soldier
That nameless faceless one
A young girl's lover
A baby's father
Some mother's son
Too young to know
His daddy's gone
He hears him say
His mother must be strong
So he pretends
Like children do
He likes to stand
In his daddy's shoes
Freedom needs a soldier
A nameless faceless one
A young girl's lover
A baby's father
Some mother's son
Freedom needs a soldier
Until the battle's won
A young girl's lover
A baby's father
Some mother's son
She closes her eyes
And sees him at three
In her mind
That's the age he'll always be
And only God
Understands her love
Now she prays
To the angels up above
Freedom needs a soldier
That nameless faceless one
A young girl's lover
A baby's father
Some mother's son
Freedom needs a soldier
Until the battle's won
A young girl's lover
A baby's father
Some mother's son <start> Her hair was as black as pike county cold
And her lips were as red as blood on the snow
She wore short vinyl skirts and them boots to her knees
And she lived in the holler across the mountain from me
Hard Candy so sweet
And I could never get enough
Hard Candy so easy
For me to love
Wild horses couldn't keep her old man outta jail
From bootlegging whiskey his sons helped him sell
And growing up in that holler wasn't nothing but hot
Fightin' roosters and Kerr dogs tied up in the yard
Hard Candy so sweet
And I could never get enough
Hard Candy so easy
For me to love
One night on the mountain back in the pine trees
Candy let down her guard she said she loved me
We left the holler when her old man got put back in jail
And she told all her brothers to go straight to Hell
Hard Candy so sweet
And I could never get enough
Hard Candy so easy
For me to love <start> Somebody get me a guitar
Cause I got something to sing to you
Picked up a groove in my car
It's gonna get in the soles of your shoes
It ain't about lonely heart did you wrong
Broken promise leaving song

We've all had enough of those nights

Somebody grab a megaphone

Leaving our worries behind
Come on and put your hand in mine

I wanna sing about the good times 
I wanna sing about the good times <start> You told me you don't love me when you walked out the door
I stood there feelin' lonely then the tears began to pour
What else could I do I'd never felt like that before
So I cried an ol' blue river in the middle of the floor
Chorus
Now I'm up to my ears in tears
I'm cryin' night and day since you went away
The things you used to say honey I no longer hear
That water's cold and clear I'm drownin' for you dear
Up to my ears in tears
Well I found some old love letters you wrote me years ago
But the words all ran together when the tears began to flow
Cause you left that water runnin' now it's got nowhere to go
If I can't wash away your memory well I'll just go under slow
Chorus <start> There's a little girl livin' on the street
I don't understand
Turnin' tricks to get some some food to eat
I don't understand
There's a mama prayin' to god to bring her baby back
I don't understand
I don't understand
There's a crack house down across the tracks
I don't understand
People tradin' smoke for cold hard cash
I don't understand
There's just no way this could be part of the greater plan
I don't understand
I don't understand
Is everybody livin' in a world without windows
Am I the only one who ses
If this is all that's left of what was once the promise landoh
I just can't comprehend it
I just don't understand
There's a daddy walkin' out the door
I don't understand
Leavin' three kids who need him more
Then he understands
These days the trouble starts right where the family ends
I don't understand
I don't understand
Is everybody livin' in a world without windows
Am I the only one who ses
If this is all that's left of what was once the promise landoh
I just can't comprehend it
I just don't understand
Is everybody livin' in a world without windows
Am I the only one who ses
If this is all that's left of what was once the promise landoh
I just can't comprehend it
I just don't understand
I don't understand <start> In the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia there's a girl who is waitin' just for me
Many times we walked in the moonlight and in her loving arms I long to be
I miss her smile in the moonlight and I know she misses me too
In the Shenandoah Valley of Virgiania I know that her love is still true
 fiddle  steel 
In the Shenandoah Valley... <start> 
Chorus
Love is pretty when love is new
Like a blushing rose in a dazzling dew
Intoxicating like cherry sweet wine.
When love is new it's magic.
Verse 
Mother oh Mother why can't you see
He's the only love for me.
Why must thou be opposed to me
I'm asking for thy blessing.
Daughter oh daughter I know his kind.
You think he's handsome you think he's fine.
He'll use your body and tangle your mind
Too late you'll learn this lesson
Repeat Chorus
When love grows cold it's tragic
Verse 
Mother oh mother he's not that way
His touch just takes my breath away.
You surely remember when you felt that way
When you and father first married
Oh yes I do remember it well.
What first was heaven soon turned to hell
He left with another the year you were born.
I told you he's dead and buried.
Repeat Chorus
Bridge
He'll love me true 'cause he told me so.
He'll break you heart when love grows old.
I must go Mother I must go.
Then daughter why are you asking
I love him so I love him so.
Then I pray you're new love's lasting.
Repeat Chorus
Tag
When love grows cold it's tragic. <start> Here we are out of cigarettes holding hands and yawning look how late it gets
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light and too much in love to say goodnight
Here we are in the cozy chair picking on a wish upon from the frigid air
Two sleepy people with nothing to say and too much in love to break away
Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall
Your father didn't like me at all
Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall
To rid this little nest and get a little bit of rest
Well here we are just about the same foggy little fellow drawsy little dame
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light and too much in love to say goodnight
Too much in love to say goodnight <start> Look ayonder comin' comin' down that railroad track
Hey look ayonder comin' comin' down that railroad track
It's the Orange Blossom Special bringin' my baby back
Well I'm going down to Florida and get some sand in my shoes
Or maybe Californy and get some sand in my shoes
I'll ride that Orange Blossom Special and lose these New York blues
Say man when you going back to Florida
When am I goin' back to Florida I don't know don't reckon I ever will
Ain't you worried about getting your nourishment in New York
Well I don't care if I dodie dodie dodie dodie
Hey talk about aramblin' she's the fastest train on the line
Talk about atravellin' she's the fastest train on the line
It's that Orange Blossom Special rollin' down the seaboard line <start> 
Some guysoohthey're really something
They're always acting like they're so hot
And youyou don't seem any different
I keep a wishin' but I guess you're not

You might be tough
But that's not enough to make it last
You wanna what
Those eyesoohI see right through'em
The way you stare gives you away
Don't even go thereoohyou just don't get it
Real love can't be that way
You wanna whatI don't think so
I don't waste my time on guys like that
You might be tough
But that's not enough to make it last
You wanna what
Oohdon't you think you oughta be ashamed
OohI hate to tell you I don't play that game
You wanna whatI don't think so
I don't waste my time on guys like that

My Crowd.
Parody of Montgomery Gentry's My Town
Enjoy
There's a big old line down at the TicketMaster
I admit it it's a sight I'd love to see
A few of them look like they need a shower
But they're holding signs saying I love Cledus T.
If it wasn't for them I'd be right in the poor house
Country music fans are the best around
Them's my crowd

Yeah them is my crowd

Hey
Sell the farm
Sell the bread
All their necks are a little red
They love Hank
They love Hag
They've been known to wave the flag
They're always up gettin' down
They get riled if they get loud
Them is my crowd

Hey you're with my crowd

My crowd
There's a lot of drinkin' beer
When they fire up the grill
They'll line up at the portaJohns real soon
If you ask me there ain't nothing louder
Than a country music concert coming through
Come tomorrow morning out in the parking lot
There'll be fifty thousand beer cans on the ground
And them's my crowd

Yeah
This is my crowd

Overworked
Underpaid
They all work more than minimum wage
When Earnhardt died
They all was sad
Gun control makes them fightin' mad
Pop a top pass it around
Turn it up then chuck it down
This is my crowd

Yeah you're with my crowd

My crowd
CleDUS
CleDUS
CleDUS
CleDUS
CleDUS
CleDUS
CleDUS
CleDUS
Well I hope I bought you all a lot of laughter
I'm gonna miss ya
You made me feel like a big star
My tour bus will hit the road in a couple of hours
And fans like you make leaving really hard
We'll do another big show come tomorrow night
But you are hard to beat I'm telling you right now
And maybe later old T. Judd will take one of you cowgirls
Back to my house

Yeah
You're with my Crowd

Hey
You yell some more
Some hell was raised
Y'all be hung over for days
You got to hear some real hot bands
And got to meet some real cool fans
We raised the roof and burned it down
And see y'all next time around
Y'all with my crowd

Yeah this is my crowd

My crowd <start> I never was the kind to wear my feelings on my sleeve
But since I met you girl there's been a world of change in me
I've got to say I love you hope you like the sound of that
'Cause I can't keep it under this ol' hat
Chorus
Under this ol' hat
Is the head you turned around
And the heart you stole away
The day we met
under this ol' hat's
Two arms that long to hold you tight
And boots I'd walk the soles off of
To be here by your side
And every night in my prayers there's just
One thing I ask
That the man you love will always be
Under this ol' hat
You've got me feeling things
I've never felt before
And it's so good to know when I come a knocking at your door
That of all the men who'd love to waltz across your welcome mat
The one you want is under this ol' hat
Chorus <start> Here we are talking about forever
Both know damn well it's not easy together
We've both felt love
We've both felt pain
I'll take the sunshine over the rain
Chorus
And I'll try to love only you
And I'll try my best to be true
Oh darling I'll try
So I'm not scared
It's worth a chance to me
Take my hand let's face eternity
Well I can't tell you I'll never change
But I can swear that in every way
Chorus
I'm not perfect
Just another man
But I will give you all that I am
Chorus
I'll try.
To be true to you I'll try
I'll try
To always love you I'll try <start> The old man got to feelin' bad
In the middle of the night
His grandson got up out of bed
And lit the coal oil light
He sat there and held his hand
Till his grandpa felt alright
And then he tucked him back in bed
And kissed his wrinkled brow goodnight
Chorus
Now that's love real love
Every once in a while
When someone goes the extra mile
I'll bet God smiles and says Now that's love
A father told his eight year old
Son I'll have to miss you game today
I've got to fly to Houston
The boss says there's a deal that just can't wait
The young boy tried to hide his tears
But his dad could feel his pain
And he knew he'd have to tell the boss
My son comes first I've got to make that game
Chorus
A young girl told her mother
I can't raise this child alone
He said he would marry me
But this note says he's gone
Her mother pulled her close and said
Honey I can't judge what's right or wrong
But as long as there's a breath of life in me
Your child will have a home
Chorus <start> Come ride the little train
that is rolling down the tracks
to the junction.
Forget about your cares
it is time to relax
at the junction.
Lotsa curves you bet.
Even more when you get
to the junction.
Petticoat Junction.
There's a little hotel
called the Shady Rest
at the junction.
Petticoat Junction.
It is run by Kate
come and be her guest
at the junction.
Petticoat Junction.
And that's Uncle Joe
he's a movin' kind of slow
at the junction.
Petticoat Junction.
When they hear the dinner bell
from the Shady Rest Hotel
at the junction.
Folks will walk a country mile
for that chicken countrystyle
at the junction
But the dishes to observe
are those pretty gals who serve
at the junction.
Petticoat Junction. <start> Earthly wealth and fame may never come to me
In the Pallit's Fair here my name may never be
But not come what may it cries for me with care
Anywhere is home when he is only there
Anywhere is home let come and go what may
Anywhere I roam he keeps me all the way
So for his fear sake my cross I'll neatly bear
Anywhere is home if Christ my Lord is there
 guitar 
Oh I'm tossed about and driven by the foe
Sad within without wherever I may go
But I press along still looking up in prayer
For it's home sweet home if Christ is only there
Anywhere is home let come... <start> Living down here they throw me down and count me
I'm making this up it keeps my feathers clean
And the black boys they kick my ass and tell me
That the women their ruby lips are dry.
I get angry and I get sad
And I lose this sweetness that I used to have
And I boil my strings
To get them back to gold
Sleeping in here they give me plenty to eat
Don't make trouble make something with the concrete
So I fill my pipes with it to break them black boys heads
Lord but I wish I had a gun. <start> If you want it baby hmm I've got it I got most anything you want
You call it baby hmm I've got it I got most anything you want
If it's lots of money and if it's lots of fun
Well let me tell you honey I see that it is done
If you want it baby hmm I've got it I got most anything you want
 steel 
If you want it baby...
If it's hugs and kisses the kinds that's on the sly
Well I've got plenty of 'em let you might wonna try
If you want it baby hmm I've got it I got most anything you want <start> It's just an old beat up truck
Some say that I should trade up
Now that I got some jangle in my pocket
But what they don't understand
Is it's the miles that make a man
I wouldn't trade that thing in for a rocket
What they don't know is my dad and me
We drove her out to Tennessee
And she's still here and now he's gone
So I hold on
It's just an old beat up box
Its rusty strings across the top
It probably don't look like much to you
But these dents and scratches in the wood
Yeah that's what makes it sound so good
To me it's better than brand new
You see this here flat top guitar
Has had my back in a million bars
Singing every country song
So I hold on
To the things I believe in
My faith your love our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
Yeah I hold on I hold on
Like the stripes to the flag
Like a boy to his dad
I can't change who I am right or wrong
So I hold on
Yeah baby looking at you right now
There ain't never been no doubt
Without you I'd be nothing
So if you ever worry about
Me walking out
Yeah let me tell you something
I hold on
I hold on
Can you hear me baby
I hold on
Yea
I hold on
To the things I believe in
My faith your love our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
To the things I believe in
My faith your love our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
Yeah I hold on
I hold on
I hold on and on and on and on and on
I hold on and on and on and on and on <start>  Both 
I love you you you no one else will ever do always true true true I'll forever be to you
I love you no one new will never ever do I'll always be true to you cause I love you
 Bobby 
The wedding bells are ringing in the chapel just over the hill
They're ringing for the wedding of my best friend Bill
He wed the girl I loved and I'd rather to die than to live I got to choose
Cause I've lost her and I've lost the friend
But there's one thing I'd never lose that's the way that she says
 Skeeter 
I love you you you no one else will ever do
Always true true true I'll forever be to you
 Bobby 
Yes in her shy sorta way I could leave you here now cause I like she was here today
She said she would always love me she would always be good and true
Yes that's one thing I'll never forget the way she says
 Skeeter 
I'll always be true to you cause I love you
 Both 
I love you you you...
I'll always be true to you cause I love you <start> When I look out over a green field of clover
Or watch the sun set at the end of the day
I get kind of moody when I see such beauty
And everything's beautiful in its own way
When I see a fountain flow from a mountain
Or see April showers bring flowers to May
I can't help but ponder life is such a wonder
And everything's beautiful in its own way
Words can't describe what I feel inside
When I see the beauty in each coming day
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold
And everything's beautiful in its own way
When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away
In the midst of such anger destruction and danger
The storm's even beautiful in its own way
When I see leaves drop off from the treetop
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder
God made all things beautiful in their own way <start> I was waltzing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced him to my loved one
And while they were waltzing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes I lost my little darling the night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes I lost my little darling the night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz <start> Silent night holy night
All is calm all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ the Saviour is born
Silent night holy night
Son of God love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at Thy birth
Jesus Lord at Thy birth
Sleep in heavenly peace <start> How sweet it is to know someone like you
Someone that's glad to walk with me every step of the way
How sweet it is to know a love that's true
A love that keeps on growing stronger every day
If not for you my heart would still be a prisoner of the wind
Not knowing where to go or carrying where it's been
How sweet it is not having to be afraid
How sweet it is to know you're in my arms to stay
If not for you
How sweet it is to know you're in my arms to stay <start> I'm a lifer
I can hear that rain fallin' on it's hidden roof
Girl after all we've been through
Feels like the calm after the storm
So what you say we take this sunday
Let me love you till it's monday
We'll go have a fun day and baby we'll get back to us
We'll get back to us
We've been trippin' over the same shit
I'm over the whose to blame shit
We throwin' up a white flag
I'm dancin' with who I came with
I'm your man and you my lady
Baby I'm a lifer I ain't goin' nowhere
Told you since day one I had to wife ya
Show the world that I just wanna love ya

Ain't nobody was sighted

Baby I'ma baby I'ma baby I'ma lifer
I'ma lifer I'ma lifer I'ma lifer
Whatever we go through girl we're family
There's nothin' we can't do can we
Tether through the weather got us better than before
We just gotta learn how to stay here
Build on the love we made here
Make more time for prayer and the man upstairs
'Cause I believe we can move any mountain when we're good
I believe I ain't me without you walkin' out in that white dress
Life without you is lifeless
I'm your man and you my lady
Baby I'm a lifer I ain't goin' nowhere
Told you since day one I had to wife ya
Show the world that I just wanna love ya
Girl I don't wanna fight ya
Yeah you're the only one for me
God knows that I'm a product of George Strait
And dammit I love sayin' to you
I done check yes and gave my mama's ring to you
Ain't nobody was sighted
My arms can't get any wider
Baby I'ma baby I'ma baby I'ma lifer
The twists and turns sometimes the love can hurt ya
Sometimes it burns The wait ain't always perfect
We'll just keep diggin' dig our feet into the dirt and get back to us
We'll get back to us
We've been trippin' over the same shit
I'm over the whose to blame shit
We throwin' up a white flag

There's somethin' about the rain drops the rain drops
Just let me fall
Till the rain stops till the rain stops let it fall
Just let 'em fall
There's somethin' about the rain drops the rain drops <start> Patient anticipation
Up 'til now I be hurry up and waiting
At a bus stop in independence licking an ice cream cone
I've been kicking I've been scheming
This is as close as I've been to leaving
Five blocks away a stone's throw away from home
But I'm as good as gone
I gotta get gone gone gone
Shooting like a gun a gun a gun
Skipping like stone stone stone
Far as I can run to where freedom is free
There's a road like a long gray ribbon far as I can see
And it's pulling independence out of me
Emancipation or paper chasing
Leaving with question marks and Momma's blessing
I put her picture in my pocket along with her rosary
Some say I'm crazy a little loco
And most of my friends will live and die in this zip code
It might be for me but until I go
How am I supposed to know
I gotta get gone gone gone
Shooting like a gun a gun a gun
Skipping like stone stone stone
Far as I can run to where freedom is free
There's a road like a long gray ribbon far as I can see
I'm busting out of independence
Independence is busting out of me
I'm busting out of independence
Independence is busting out of me
I gotta get gone gone gone
Shooting like a gun a gun a gun
Skipping like stone stone stone
Far as I can run to where freedom is free
There's a road like a long gray ribbon far as I can see
There's a road like a long gray ribbon far as I can see
And it's pulling independence out of me.
Independence. <start> I'll remember you
When I've forgotten all the rest
You to me were true
You to me were the best.
When there is no more
You cut to the core
Quicker than anyone I knew.
When I'm all alone
In the great unknown
I'll remember you.
I'll remember you
At the end of the trail
I had so much left to do
I had so little time to fail.
There's some people that
You don't forget
Even though you've only seen'm
One time or two.
When the roses fade
And I'm in the shade
I'll remember you.
Didn't I didn't I try to love you
Didn't I didn't I try to care
Didn't I sleep didn't I weep beside you
With the rain blowing in your hair
I'll remember you
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
It was you who came right through
It was you who understood.
Though I'd never say
That I done it the way
That you'd have liked me to.
In the end
My dear sweet friend
I'll remember you <start> Chorus
But old photographs have a way of fading
Like a love that was never meant to be
Still each night I take out the family bible
But old photographs sure get to me <start> Whose arms are you in tonight darling is it someone I know
Whose arms are holding you tight so baby don't ever go
If arms were just harbors then you seen the world from one to another you sail
Yes you tried to hide it but have you feel low it's almost like reading your mail
Whose arms are you in tonight...
No baby don't ever go <start> Ahhh... we'll snort with pleasure
Ahhh... we'll forego washing
We'll hold a holiday of love
I'm a green tree you're the air
I'll follow you there
I'll follow you
Engulf me lover
Ahhh... we'll take a tumble
Ahhh... down in the gravel
I'll take your hand to lead me over
Hang our colors in the air
I wanna follow you there
I wanna follow you
Engulf me lover
And loop me into blue
Enfold me lover
Ahhh... we'll taste the nectar
Ahhh... we'll share the bounty
I'll bear the cost of our defense
Never looking back again
I'm gonna follow you in
I wanna follow you
Engulf me lover
And loop me into blue
Enfold me lover
Enclose me lover <start> Sometimes I'm fine I get to thinking of the past
We swore to each other that our love would surely last
You kept right on lovin' I went on a fast
Now I'm too thin and your love is too vast
But I know from your eyes and I know from your smile
That tonight will be fine will be fine will be fine will be fine for awhile
I'd choose the room but I live in the can
The windows are small and the walls are almost square
There's only one bed and there's only one chair
I listen all night for the step on the stair
But I know from your eyes...
 ac.guitar  banjo 
Sometimes I see her undressing for me she's a soft naked lady love meant to be
And she's moving her body so brave and so free
A fact to remember that's a fine memory
And I know from your eyes...
And I know from her eyes... <start> With skin as tough as a burlap sack he had his second heart attack last summer
But he's still goin'
There's a melancholy in his eyes for all of you who care enough to wonder why
Let me tell you
It all started back in  when ole Walt Disney took him by surprise
Thats the day Old Yeller died
Well that twelve year old became a man eleven years to soon in Vietnam
With his best friend Tommy
They were tough as nails and southern born and awfully proud to wear that uniform
Then things got scary
On April th Tommy left for heaven the same year the world was taken by surprise
That's the day Martin Luther died
So before you judge him you need to know there's more to that old man
Then what you see there on that barstool with the bourbon on his hand
You heard about his younger years but don't leave now theres more to hear
That might explain the pain in that old man
How quick America forgot about the only war they'd lost and life goes on
That's what they tell ya
No ticker tape no reason why might have never seen the end of that chapter in his life
If he hadn't met Betty
They married in December  no doubt it was the best day of his life
Two days before John Lennon died
So before you judge him you need to know there's more to that old man
Than what you see there on the barstool with the bourbon in his hand
Now we've covered chapter two I can almost see a change in you
There's still a lot of life in that old man
He hadn't had a drink in at least a year to tell the truth I'm shocked he's here
But as long as he wants'em I'm gonna pour'em
Before you came in I asked him why he raised his fragile head and wiped his eyes
Then he told me
I've seen so much in my life I've never questioned this time the good Lord took me by surprise
Yesterday my Betty died
With skin as tough as a burlap sack he had his second heart attack last summer
But he's still goin' <start>  Both 
They say for every boy and girl there's just one love in this old world
And I know I've found mine
The heavenly touch of your embrace tells me no one can take your place
Ever in my heart
Young love first love filled with true devotion
Young love our love we share with deem emotion
 ac.guitar 
Just one kiss from your sweet lips will tell me that your love is real
And I can feel that it's true
We will vow to one another that there'll never be any other
Love for you or for me
Young love first love...
Young love <start> You gotta walk that lonesome valley you gotta go all by yourself
No one else can walk it for you you gotta walk all by yourself
My mama said when she was dying just before she passed away
Said come here son sit down beside me you better listen to your mama's say
That you gotta walk that lonesome valley...
Now many men has walked that valley they had to walk all by theirselves
Cause no one else could walk it for them so you gotta walk all by yourself
Yes you gotta walk that lonesome valley...
You must go and stand your trials boy and you gotta stand all by yourself
Cause no one else can stand them for you you gotta stand all by yourself
Yes you gotta walk that lonesome valley...
Yes you gotta go all by yourself <start> You're back in town again spreadin' talk around
That I'm still in love with you though you let me down
I hate to admit it but I guess the talk is true
Or else you wouldn't make my heart ache the way you do
I've got a new heartache about an old sweetheart that left me for somebody new
I've got a new heartache about an old sweetheart and that's why I'm feeling so blue
Why did you turn up again I was doing fine
I had another sweetheart to drive you from my mind
I thought I'd forgotten you but I know that it's not true
Or else you couldn't make my heart ache the way you do
I've got a new heartache <start> If I had a million hearts
I'd save the best for you
All I have is this one sad heart
Not quite torn in two
It's not exactly damaged goods
It's not exactly new
But this purple heart is true
Well I have been the one to leave
And I have been left too
But still I wear it on my sleeve
Can't hide what we've been through
'Cause we have been in love and war
We've got the scars to prove
That this purple heart is true
I will love you honestly
Tell me what else could I do
'Cause this purple heart is true <start> Oh the sun's gonna shine in my life once more
Love's gonna live here again
Things are gonna be the way they were before
Love's gonna live here again
Love's gonna live here love's gonna live here love's gonna live here again
No more loneliness only happiness love's gonna live here again
 ac.guitar 
I hear bells a ringin' I hear birds a singin'
Love's gonna live here again
I hear bees a hummin' and I know the days are comin'
Love's gonna live here again
Love's gonna live here... <start> We call them cool
Those hearts that have no scars to show
The ones that never do let go
And risk it the tables being turned
We call them fools
Who have to dance within the flame
Who chance the sorrow and the shame
That always come with getting burned
But you got to be tough when consumed by desire
'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire
We call them strong
Those who can face this world alone
Who seem to get by on their own
Those who will never take the fall
We call them weak
Who are unable to resist
The slightest chance love might exist
And for that forsake it all
They're so hell bent on giving walking a wire
Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire
There's this love that is burning
Deep in my soul
Constantly yearning to get out of control
Wanting to fly higher and higher
I can't abide standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire <start> I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be
I got heartaches in my pocket
I got echoes in my head
And all that I keep hearing
Are the cruel cruel things that you said
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be
Oh I
Oh I
Oh I
Oh I
Oh I
Oh I
I got bruises on my memory
I got tear stains on my hands
And in the mirror there's a vision
Of what used to be a man
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be
Oh I'm
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
I'm a thousand I'm a thousand I'm a thousand <start> Brazil where hearts were entertaining June
We stood beneath an amber moon
And softly murmured 'someday soon.'
We kissed and clung together
Then tomorrow was another day
The morning found me miles away
With still a million things to say
Now when twilight dims the sky above
Recalling thrills of our love
There's one thing I'm certain of
Return I will to old Brazil <start> Last night as I got home about a half past ten
There was the woman I thought I knew
In the arms of another man
I kept my cool I ain't no fool
Let me tell you what happened then
I packed some clothes and I walked out
And I ain't going back again
So take a letter Maria address it to my wife
Say I won't be coming home gonna start a new life
So take a letter Maria address it to my wife
Send a copy to my lawyer gotta start a new life
You've been many things but most of all a good secretary to me
And it's times like this I feel you've always been close to me
Was I wrong to work nights to try to build a good life
All work and no play has just cost me a wife
So take a letter Maria address it to my wife
Say I won't be coming home gonna start a new life
So take a letter Maria address it to my wife
Send a copy to my lawyer gotta start a new life
When a man loves a woman it's hard to understand
That she would find more pleasure in the arms of another man
I never really noticed how sweet you are to me
It just so happens I'm free tonight
Would you like to have dinner with me
So take a letter Maria address it to my wife
Say I won't be coming home gonna start a new life
So take a letter Maria address it to my wife
Send a copy to my lawyer gotta start a new life
So take a letter Maria address it to my wife
Send a copy to my lawyer gotta start a new life <start> In a little while she'll come to wake me just like always
She'll lean down and sweetly press her lips on mine
And say good morning daddy good morning how I love this little girl of mine
Then we both sit at the table having coffee
She says mama put a lot of milk in mine
Just like daddy's mama just like daddy's oh how I love this little girl of mine
Then one day she'll grow up and be gone and she'll have a small one of her own
But right now she's still my baby just like always
And I'm glad it's gonna be a long long time
I'll hear good morning daddy good morning how I love this little girl of mine
Oh how I love this little girl of mine <start> I'm not in your town to stay said a lady old and gray
To the warden of the penitentiary
I'm not in your town to stay and I'll soon be on my way
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail

I tried to raise him right and I prayed both day and night
That he'd never follow the footsteps of his dad
I have searched both far and wide and I feared that he had died
Now at last I found my baby here in jail

It was just five years today since my husband passed away
He was found beneath the snow so cold and white
Made a vow to keep his ring his golden watch and his chain
But the county laid my husband in the ground

I will pawn you my watch I will pawn you my chain
I will pawn you my golden diamond ring
I will wash all your clothes I will scrub all your floors
If that will get my baby out of jail

Then we heard the warden say to that lady old and gray
I will bring your baby boy to your side
Two big iron gates swung wide apart she held her darlin' to her heart
She kissed her baby boy and then she died
 <start> A time to be reapin' a time to be sowin'
The green leaves of summer are callin' me home
It was good to be young then in the season of plenty
When the catfish were jumpin' as high as the sky
A time just for plantin' a time just for ploughin'
A time to be courtin' a girl of your own
'Twas so good to be young then to be close to the earth
And to stand by your wife at the moment of birth


'Twas so good to be young then to be close to the earth
Now the green leaves of summer are callin' me home
'Twas so good to be young then to be close to the earth
Now the green leaves of summer are callin' me home
The green leaves of summer are callin' me home
Correct variant
A time to be reapin' a time to be sawin'
The green leaves of summer are callin' me home
It was good to be young then in the season of plenty
When the catfish are jumpin' as high as the sky
A time just for plantin' a time just for ploughin'
A time to be courtin' a girl of your own
'Twas so good to be young then to be close to the earth
And to stand by your wife at the moment of birth
A time to be reapin' a time to be sawin'
The green leaves of summer are callin' me home
'Twas so good to be young then with the sweet smell of apples
And the owl in the pine tree akin' his eye
A time just for plantin' a time just for ploughin'
A time just for livin' a place for to die
'Twas so good to be young then to be close to the earth
Now the green leaves of summer are calling me home <start> Well the turn signal's clicking and the seconds are slipping away
Just a little bit more of this turnpike and so much to say
The airport traffic it slows us to a still
You turn the radio down and leave one hand on the wheel
Well I don't know how to tell ya what you wanna hear
You see guys like me we just disappear
And you deserve someone who'll never leave
But girl the last few days are the best we'll ever be
Chorus
Isn't every goodbye a chance to become
A bittersweet memory for someone
Don't you ever look back with regret
Share with me a moment for all time
In a corner of your mind
If you've never seen New England in the fall
Should you find yourself up there give me a call
But before I make my way into the crowd
Could I share one more kiss while we're still in the clouds
Repeat Chorus Twice
In a corner of your mind <start> Oh Lord my God when I in all some wonder
Considered all the worlds Thy hands have made
I see the stars I hear the rolling thunder
Thy art throughout the universe displayed
Then sings my soul my Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art how great Thou art
Then sings my soul my Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art how great Thou art
When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation
To take me home what joy shall fill my heart
Then I will bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim My God how great Thou art
Then sings my soul my Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art how great Thou art
Then sings my soul My Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art how great Thou art
How great Thou art how great Thou art <start> Sitting out here on the hood of this truck looking up
At a caramel colored sunset sky
Checking my watch doing the math in my head
Counting back words to when you said goodbye
Well those runway lights are getting brighter
I'm just sitting out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Trying to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
Right now I'm sitting out here watching airplanes
I would've lied could've cried should've tried harder
Done anything to make you stay
I wonder what you'd do if you looked out your window
Saw me running down the runway just like I was crazy
That fence is too high so am I
So I'm just sitting out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Trying to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
By now I know you're thirty thousand feet above me
But a million miles away a million miles away
By now I know I ought to act like you don't love me
I'm just sitting out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Trying to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
Right now I'm sitting out here watching airplanes
Yeah I'm just sitting out here watching airplanes
Go by by by
I'm just sitting out here watching airplanes
Baby bye bye bye <start> Red lips blue eyes and little white lies
Oh darlin' I'm a fool for you
Hey darlin' why can't you can be true
Red lips blue eyes and sweet disguise
Oh darlin' the things you put me through
Your little white lies are breaking my heart in two
You come around and tell me that you love me so
You take a little loving then you say you gotta go
I know he's waiting for you on the other side of town
Well I'm a fool to love you baby 'cause I know you're messing around
Red lips blue eyes and little white lies
Oh darlin' why can't you be true
I'm crazy to love you baby you know I do yeah
Sooner or later you'll have to face the truth
Little white lies will catch up with you
With nowhere to run and no where to hide
And no one to love you there by your side
Red lips blue eyes and little white lies
Oh darlin' the things you put me through
But your little white lies are gonna catch up with you
Oh your little white lies are gonna catch up with you
Baby your little white lies are gonna catch up with you <start> Making believe
That you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
Still I'll always dream
But I'll never own you
Making believe
It's all I can do
Can't hold you close
When you're not with me
You're somebody's love
You'll never be mine
Making believe I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believe
Making believe
I never lost you
But my happy hours
Are far and so few
My plans for the future
Will never come true
Making believe
What else can I do
Making believe
I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believe <start> I told you right from the start
I'd give you my heart cause I'm just a fool like that
Always want to believe in the best
But the evil comes out and throws me out of track
Remember when you told me that you'd always stand by me
But you don't get me so why you gotta keep on holding me back like this
You don't want me but you won't take these chains off from my wrists
I'm never be good enough for you never be good enough
What are we doing you don't get me so so let me go
Just let me go
Dreams I've got for me
There yours to keep
I had 'em all before you came around
I'll be there with my bag
I'll wait in the dark
The northern will never be found
I had to fall apart
To light the spark
That fire me up again
But you don't get me so why you gotta keep on holding me back like this
You don't want me but you won't take these chains off from my wrists
I'm never be good enough for you never be good enough
What are we doing you don't get me so so let me go
Just let me go
I had to fall apart
To light the spark
That fire me up again
But you don't get me so why you gotta keep on holding me back like this
You don't want me but you won't take these chains off from my wrists
I'm never be good enough for you never be good enough
What are we doing you don't get me so so let me go
Just let me go <start> It's all the same only the names are changed
Everyday it seems we're wasting away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night just to get back home
Chorus
Cause I'm a cowboy on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted
Dead or alive
Sometimes I sleep sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day
By the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone all you do is think
Chorus
I walk these streets a loaded six string on my back
I play for keeps 'cause I might not make it back
I been everywhere still I'm standing tall
I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all
I'm a cowboy on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
I'm a cowboy I got the night on my side
And I'm wanted
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive <start>  Mary Lou 
Two nights in the pourin' rain 
That's what made me love you 
Champagne in a dixie cup 
 Both 
That's what made me love you that's what made me love you
 Mary Lou 
There ain't no way that time can make a bad thing out of our love
 Bill 
In a hundred years I'll think back and I'll have the memory of
 Mary Lou 
A box of candy and a wilted rose 
 Both 
That's what made me love you that's what made me love you
 Mary Lou 
Champagne in a dixie cup  yeah you had too much
But that's what made me love you 
Two nights in the pourin' rain 
 Both 
That's what made me love you that's what made me love you <start> I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams <start> There must be a reason for raindrops to fall.
There must be a reason why mountains are tall.
And why are the stars in the sky
There must be a reason why.
There must be a reason for rivers to flow.
For beautiful trees and flowers to grow.
And why have the birds wings to fly
There must be a reason why.
The changes from season to season
The dawning that brings the new day.
These wonders mist all have a reason
It was intended that way.
There must be a reason for falling in love
It must have been planned up in Heaven above.
And why are we so much in love you and I
There must be a reason why.
The changes from season to season
The dawning that brings the new day.
These wonders mist all have a reason
It was intended that way.
There must be a reason for falling in love
It must have been planned up in Heaven above.
And why are we so much in love you and I
There must be a reason why.
There must be a reason why. <start> Ocean of stars why've i gone so far
i miss my home
i hear those engines drone
the runway is set
let's move this fucking jet i have to go
despite all the sleet and snow
just a late night host leaving dallas
with a portrait done in velvet
just a three night run at the palace
and i've never in my life felt so alone
i worked for the show
stars would come and go
i worked the lights
i even swept some nights
but now i'm the host that's worthy of a toast
don't you agree my little honeybee
just a late night king leaving dallas
with a portrait done in velvet
just a three night run at the palace
i'll be at th and broadway by tonight
so far away from all these wonders
even as the roulette spins
i just courted seventeen miles
came upon all winds bend
even in dreams of light
i can still hear her call through the tall grass and weeds
and i know i'll never be the same on this road to calvary
just a late night host leaving dallas
with a portrait done in velvet
just a three night run at the palace
and i never in my life felt so alone
and i never in my life felt so alone <start> There goes my everything
I hear footsteps slowly walkin'
As they gently walk across a lonely floor
And a voice is softly sayin'
Darling this will be goodbye forever more
There goes my reason for livin'
There goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession
There goes my everything
As my mem'ry turns back the pages
I can see the happy years we had before
Now the love that kept this ol' heart beatin'
Has been shattered by the closin' of the door
There goes my reason for livin'
There goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession
There goes my everything
There goes my reason for livin'
There goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession
There goes my everything
There goes my only possession
There goes my everything <start> If time were not a moving thing and I could make it stay this hour
The love we share will always be there'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light and make us realize all night it's over
When you walk away from me there is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes against the sun that rises over land
I watch you walk away somehow I have to let you go now it's over
If you knew just how I really feel you might turn yet
There are so many times that people have to love and then forget
Though there might have been a way
I have to force myself to say it's over
So I turn my back and turn my collar to the wind
Move along in silence trying not to think at all
I send my feet before me walk the silent street before me it's over <start> I've been waitin' on a cold front to trample this sun
I've been callin' my mama on the telephone
I've been cookin' lots of chicken on the kitchen stove
And pulin' a'meat right off the bone
I've been sendin' letters of sorrow home
I've been hurtin' daily and sleepin' long
I've been eatin' lots of chicken and getting' mighty stoned
And pullin' meat right off the bone.

Ain't asked myself how did it get this way
But when I ask myself I ain't got much to say
I'm just a'cookin' chicken and eatin' crow
And pullin' meat right off the bone.

We have no preacher to marry our son
Our daughters have no faith in a Christian home
How shall we live now that God is gone
just pullin' meat right off the bone.

Ain't asked myself how did it get this way
But when I ask myself I ain't got much to say
I'm just a'cookin' chicken and eatin' crow
And pullin' meat right off the bone.
I'm pullin' meat right off the bone. <start> They call me Catfish Bates
'Cause I can catch a catfish anytime I want to
Even when the moon man tells me they won't bite
They call me Catfish Bates
'Cause I know where that big ole flathead's a hiddin'.
I'm a gonna take him home with me tonight
I am the king of Looseyhatchie
My home is on the river
And them catfish they all know me by my sigh
I keep my nose on the westwind
My eye on the water
And my mind on my business all the time
Well I get me a plug a days worth of tobacco
And a can a big ole redworms
I go down to where the rivers runnin' strong
I throw my hook out on the water
I let it float on down the channel
And I'll have me a big ole flathead 'for too long
Oh when they bury me I want to be somewhere on the river
With a big ole flathead layin' on my stone
And them catfish will all be prayin
They'll be flatheads up in heaven
So my ghost will leave them hatchie cats alone <start> What's that look you're giving me
Staring me down with fire in your eyes
But it's alright baby cause you look so good
When you're giving me a hard time
I can tell by your smile
That making up might take a while
Chorus
Maybe we should lose some sleep tonight
Wrap yourself around this heart of mine
Let's count the stars in each others eyes
Maybe we should lose some sleep tonight
Yeah that's right I meant what I said
I'm getting tired of playing around
That's enough I've had it up to here
Let's settle this right now
Who said it wasn't any fun
I hope we're in for a long one
Chorus
Baby laying here with you now
Makes me want to drag this whole thing down
Chorus <start> Used to know ya perhaps too well
All my emotions
Were puzzle underneath your spell
When you wrote I felt high
In a place where there'll my pride
Catch my breath sweet goodbyes
Waste of all my time
I get son down on myself
You talk like somebody else
But it ain't like that
When we're part
What happened on
I used to know ya
All too well
I wouldn't control ya
You wouldn't take it so well
When you speak I'm numb
The feeling oh so dumb
Say goodbye I say hey
Baby whatcha do today
I get so down on myself
You act like somebody else
Ad now I'm too set to turn the radio on
I'm so down on myself
You talk like somebody else
But it ain't like that
When we're apart
No it ain't like that when we're apart
No it ain't like that when we're apart <start> Some people say that love is a rose  and maybe they've hit
It right on the nose
But other folks say that it's like the sun
Well a long time ago daddy said to me 'son I'll help clear
Up the mystery  I'll give you a simple rule of thumb'
If it knocks you off your feet  then it's love  then it's love
If it makes your life complete  then it's love  then it's love
If it turns you upside down  then it's love  then it's love
If it makes your world go round then it's love
Now the dictionary won't tell you much  if love is the word
You're lookin' up
No I don't believe that definition's right
And the encyclopedia won't reveal the crazy way you start
To feel  kissin' on a moonlit summer night cause
If it knocks you off your feet  then it's love  then it's love
If it makes your life complete  then it's love  then it's love
If it turns you upside down  then it's love  then it's love
If it makes your world go round then it's love
So go on and say that love is a game  or maybe compare it
To a flame
Or say it's a medicine that heals
'cause a panel of experts could fight all night  and never
figure out which one is right
but they'd agree on how it makes you feel
If it knocks you off your feet  then it's love  then it's love
If it makes your life complete  then it's love  then it's love
If it turns you upside down  then it's love  then it's love
If it makes your world go round then it's love
Yeah if it makes your world go round  then it's love <start> 
There will come a day when sorrow fades away
And anguish and heartache shall ease
No mothers cryin' no soldiers dyin'
And turmoil and misery shall cease.
The hungry shall be fed the aimless shall be led
And sad eyes will no longer weep
The last shall be first through heaven he'll burst
With his heavenly host from the East
Weapons to plowshares hate turns to love
Descending from heaven he'll sweep down to us
In radiant splendor oh won't it be sweet
When the raven of darkness turns into a white dove of peace

Oh there will come a day when I'll fly away
Forever to be in his keep
Eternal life in the sweet by and by
When raven dove raven dove speaks
When lambs walk with lions a child tames the beast
Nations shall gather and bow at his feet
And loved ones shall rise up from their earthly sleep
And he'll separate all the chaff from the wheat.
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah how sweet
When the raven of darkness turns into a white dove of peace
Raven dove behold he cometh in the clouds
And every eye shall see him
Sweet bird sweet bird of peace
Raven Dove <start> Mrs. William where is William
Where has William go
You know you shouldn't
Come into a place like this alone
Now if you'd like to sit here at my table I'll abide
But it isn't usually my thing to do anothers bride
I'll sell my heart I'll sell my brain
I'll sell my love and all my fame
My mother maybe
And my brother too
To raise the stake to pay for you
To get you from his side
And then I'll watch keep one eye open
Halfway fearing halfway hoping
That blackguard boy with handsome muscle
Disturb your sleep with tiny tussle
And earn by stealing Mrs. William
Mrs. William gone again
But with your eyes and with your aura
You'll never leave this place alone
I have you always the taste of us coming
You'll make the beasties and the flora
You're part of our eternal home
Humble and bow down <start> Don't call my name out your window I'm leavin'
I won't even turn my head
Don't send your kinfolks to give me no talkin'
I'll be gone like I said
You'd say the same old things you been sayin' all along
Lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shot till I'm gone
Don't give me that old familiar cryin' cussin' moan
Understand your man
Tidy your bad mouth and understand your man
You can give my other suit to the Salvation Army
And everything else I leave behind
I ain't takin' nothin' that'll slow down my traveling
While I'm untangling my mind
I ain't goin' to reappear what I said anymore
While I'm breathing air that ain't been breathed before
I'll be as gone as a wild goose in winter
Then you'll understand your man
Better tided understand your man
Look out understand your man
Uh huh understand your man <start> 
I've had to think up a way to survive
Since you said it's over
Told me goodbye
I just can't make it one day without you
Unless I pretend that the opposite's true
Rivers flow backwards
Valleys are high
Mountains are level
Truth is a lie
I'm perfectly fine
And I don't miss you
The sky is green
And the grass is blue
How much can a heart and a troubled mind take
Where is that fine line before it all breaks
Can one end their sorrow
Just cross over it
And into that realm of insanitive bliss
There's snow in the tropics
There's ice on the sun
It's hot in the Arctic
And crying is fun
And I'm happy now
And I'm glad we're through
And the sky is green
And the grass is blue
And the rivers flow backwards
And my tears are dry
Swans hate the water
And eagles can't fly
But I'm alright now
Now that I'm over you
And the sky is green
And the grass is blue
And I don't love you
And the grass is blue <start> Your eyes are the eyes of a woman in love
And though how they give you away
Why try to deny your a woman in love
When I know very well would I see
I see no moon in the sky
Ever lent such a glow
Some flame deep within made them shine
Those eyes are the eyes of a woman in love
And may they gaze ever more into mine
Crazily gaze ever more into mine
Those eyes are the eyes of a woman in love
And may they gaze ever more into mine
Crazily gaze ever more into mine <start> Lately I've been lonely
Lord knows I don't like that feeling
Anymore than you like feeling lonely too
I don't know which one's to blame
For almost putting out our flame
But for me it's not the thing for us to do
The way it was
The way we were
Baby you and me is where it was at
And I want
I want us back
Girl we've come too far for us
To give up on tomorrow
When we've shared so many good time yesterdays
If I know you like I think I do
I know that you don't want to lose
The me and you I'm dying to save
The way it was
The way we were
Baby you and me is where it was at
And I want
I want us back
I want to feel your love all over me
Wrapped up in us is where I want to be
I want I want
I want to feel your love all over me
Wrapped up in us is where I want to be
I want 
I want us back
Lately I've been lonely
Lord knows I don't like that feeling
Anymore than you like feeling lonely too <start> Am I dreaming or is that the morning sunlight shining in
I can't believe it I was so sure my world was comin' to an end
I may never live to see the day your memory lets me go
But I made it through the night and that's one in a row 
My heart's still beatin' even though it's broken right in two
So the odds are even there's still some hope that I'll get over you
Will I make it through the day girl it's hard to say I just don't know
But I made it through the night and that's one in a row
One less endless night without you
Missin' everything about you until dawn
One more sunrise to remind me
To leave yesterday behind me cause it's gone
This is only the beginning and I've got a lifetime to go
But I made it through the night and that's one in a row
Will I make it through the day girl it's hard to say I just don't know
But I made it through the night and that's one in a row
Yeah I made it through the night and that's one in a row <start> Wound up drunk again on Robson St.
Strange cuz we always agreed
At the start of every evening
That's the last place I wanna be
Coffee drinkers dressed in black with no sugar
They don't give me no respect
They say look her comes another one
And I don't know what they mean yet
And I say
Keep it light enough to travel...
Don't let it all unravel
Keep it light enough to travel
Promise me we won't go into the nightclub
I feel so fucked up when I'm in there
Can't tell the bouncers from the customers
And I don't know which ones I prefer
Promise me we won't go into the nightclub
I really think that it's obscene
What kind of people go to meet people
Someplace they can't be heard or seen
Keep it light enough to travel...
Don't let it all unravel
Keep it light enough to travel
I broke the windows of the logging company
Just to get a little release
I had to throw down my accordion
To get away from the police
And I say...
Keep it light enough to travel... <start> Last night I walked down that little country lane
And a million memories ran through my mind
Where I used to walk with you now I walk with someone new
And I'm learning to love her with time
Yes I'm learning to love her cause you've gone and found another
It's the only way I know to ease my mind
She's not you but she loves me and I know she'll stay with me
And I'm learning to love her with time
 piano 
Well over there that old oak tree where you gave your love to me
It was here you said I'll love you for all time
But tonight she's here with me and she loves the hurt away
And I'm learning to love her with time
Yes I'm learning to love her...
Yes I'm learning to love her with time <start> Abilene Abilene
Prettiest town I ever seen.
Folks down there don't treat you mean
In Abilene my Abilene.
I sit alone most every night
Watch them trains roll out of sight
Wish that they were carryin' me
To Abilene my Abilene.
Crowded city ain't nothin' free
Nothin' in this town for me
Wish to God that I could be
In Abilene my Abilene.
How I wish that train would come
Take me back where I come from.
Take me where I want to be
In Abilene my Abilene.
Rotgut whiskey numbs the brain
If I stay here I'll go insane.
Think I need a change of scene
To Abilene my Abilene.
Outside my window cold rain falls
Sit here starin' at the walls
If I was home I'd be serene
In Abilene my Abilene. <start> We're goin out tonight so we can clear our worried heads and shake some dust off.
We gotta get up every day at  and see the whole day through
with no time to waste.
Ya know I've heard terrible things but nothing near as close to home
and nothing oh so sad.
It's got me thinking I'm hoping that won't happen to us.
I just can't believe he lost his lover and his child both in the same day.
Now his baby's gone to heaven and his wife has lost her mind.
Oh it's a damn shame.
Let's go drinkin' I'm hoping that won't happen to us.
Should we go down to church on every Wednesday and Sunday morning
to be on God's side
I've been thinkin about living life my way
and the truth is that we'll all get burned
some day. <start> Some people run some people crawl some people don't even move at all
Some roads lead forward some roads lead back
Some roads are bathed in light and some wrapped in fearful black
Some people never get some never give some people never die and some never live
Some folks treat me mean some treat me kind
Most folks just go their way and don't pay me any mind
Time oh good good time where did you go time oh good good time where did you go
Sometimes I'm satisfied sometimes I'm not
Sometimes my face is cold and sometimes it's hot
At sunset I laugh sunrise I cry at midnight I'm in between and I'm wondering why
Time oh good good time where did you go time oh good good time where did you go <start> Well living in the city puts a lock on your door
Oh yeah uh huh huh
And you can't appreciate little things no more
Oh yeah uh huh huh
I can be Jack and you can be Jill
We can build a house up on top of the hill
Have a ball do it all
Beating around the bush
Say goodbye to the smog
Say goodbye to the queues
Oh yeah uh huh huh
It's been two long years and I've paid my dues
Oh yeah uh huh huh
Head up to the mountains on a long highway
Living in the city really bothers me
Have a ball do it all
Beating around the bush
Whoa whoa ho hey hey Beating around the bush
Whoa whoa ho hey hey Beating around the bush
Head up to the mountains on a long highway
Living in the city really bothers me
Have a ball do it all
Beating around the bush
Gonna get a big farm with a real nice view
Oh yeah uh huh huh
Get a horse get a dog and some chickens too
Oh yeah uh huh huh
When I get to thinking that I'm out of touch
I also get to thinking I ain't missing much
Have a ball do it all
Beating around the bush <start> I can see my old hotel
Down amongst the smells
I'm up above that ancient city river
It's filtered by my lousy liver
It's filtered by my wilted lily liver
I can see my old hotel
It ain't even a hotel
am there came some sleet or hail
It was signal taps on the brave window
Solemn taps on the wavy window
I can see my old hotel
Hear those old touristy bells
Soon I'll be down the hill shopping
Giddy like a tipsy Mary Poppins
Giddy like a tipsy Mary Poppins
I can see my old hotel
It ain't even a hotel
I'm scheduled to ride the rails
If I wished to stay on this tower
Things would derange given just another hour <start> I spent my lifetime wishin' the waitress would come around
Tellin' jokes and shootin' pool on the other side of town
When the whistle blows at five o'clock there's only one place I'll be found
Down at Ernie's icehouse liftin' longnecks to that good old country sound
And talkin' 'bout the good old times
Braggin' on how it used to be
But I've worn out the same old lines
And now it seems nothing's news to me
There's nothin' like a steel guitar cryin' in the night
There's nothin' like a sawdust floor and a good old friendly fight
I'd finally find my way back home and you'd patch up my face
But that was another time and another place
Repeat chorus
And now we're talkin' 'bout the good old times
I wonder how I came to be the knowitall I am
And how the world ever got used to me <start> You've been there all the time
right in front of my eyes
but I didn't see you
And now I shake like a leaf
now I can't seem to speak
whenever you're near me
I'm ready for a season of love
I'm ready for a change to come
and I do believe I've been waiting my whole life alone
All just for you to come along
Now I'm here with you
and out of the blue
something new is beginning
but I I can't explain
why just like the rain
I can't keep from falling
Oh I'm ready for a season of love
I'm ready for a change to come
Oh and I do believe I've been waiting my whole life alone
All just for you to come along
You've been there all the time
right in front of my eyes
but I didn't see you <start> I can still see that lonesome road stretched out before me
The road that left me out of his love
I can still feel the tears he cried on my shoulder the day that I told him goodbye
I never should have left him never should have gone oh what a crazy fool I've been
Will he be waiting for me he will be won't he and will he take me back again
Shadows from the streets shade the path that I am walking
As I make my way back up that winding road again
And the smell of my tomorrow fills the air with sweet perfume
My heart beats faster as I'm near my journey're end
I wonder if he's missed me I wonder if he wants me I wonder does he love me still
Will he be waiting for me he will be won't he oh how I hope he will
He will be waiting for me he will be won't he
How could it be his love for me has faded and has died
He will be waiting for me he will be won't he
Oh will I find that this time I'll be the one to cry
Will he be waiting for me <start> I cheated on you dear and it's no secret cause you made sure that everybody knew
But you just told them your side of the story
Cause you knew I would never tell on you
I love you much too much to tell them what you've done
I'd never let them know you cheated too
So you just tell 'em your side of the story and you know I will never tell on you
 steel 
It doesn't seem to matter that I'm sorry I've begged you to forgive a thousand times
But you're still telling your side of the story
Cause and you know I will never tell 'em mine
I love you much too much... <start> She was a sweet sweet girl to me
No matter where I go no matter who I see
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
She was a sweet sweet girl to me
She was a sweet sweet girl to me
Though she said goodbye and set me free
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
She was a sweet sweet girl to me
I can't talk about her 'cause she's with someone new
'Cause while she was with me she was true true true
Should have done right when I had my day
Now I'm all alone and I'm havin' to pay
She was a sweet sweet girl to me
Guess I had it comin' 'cause she set me free
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
She was a sweet sweet girl to me
I can't talk about her 'cause she's with someone new
'Cause while she was with me she was true true true
Should have done right when I had my day
Now I'm all alone and I'm havin' to pay
She was a sweet sweet girl to me
Guess I had it comin' 'cause she set me free
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
She was a sweet sweet girl to me
She was a sweet sweet girl to me
Oh the sweet sweet girl to me
She was a sweet sweet girl to me
She was a sweet sweet girl to me <start> I've been waiting for the perfect moment
My hands are shaking but my heart is true
I've been waiting to say I love you
But I want to be sure you'll say you love me too
So baby won't you say it with me
Or leave me out in the cold
If I fall right here would you carry me home
And if you feel the way I feel
Then you've got to let me know
If I fall right here would you carry me home
Pulled off the highway let the motor idle
Girl there's a reason why I brought you here
I said I love you and sat there silent
That one moment felt like a thousand years
So baby will you stay with me
Or leave me out here in the cold
If I fall right here would you carry me home
And if you feel the way I feel
Then you've got to let me know
If I fall right here would you carry me home <start> Well I'm lyin' in my bed a tangle of arms and legs
But the one that I'm with is not the one bouncing 'round my head.
I could turn this into song or cheap fantasy
But whatever I've ignited will still burn in me.
Bread and wine bread and wine your heart ain't nearly as guilty as mine.
I'm a dark heavy heart. I'm a soul full of holes.
I'm a boat that is sinking muddy waters threatening this baggage in my hold.
And there's a line in my head from an old gospel song
But no matter how hard I try the words they just come out wrong.
Bread and wine bread and wine your thoughts aint nearly as wicked as mine.
Bread and wine bread and wine your cross aint nearly as heavy as mine.
I've been graced by the gift of a gold wedding band.
I've been soothed by the simple caress of my true love's hand.
And yet I'm lyin' in my bed a tangle of arms and legs
And the one that I'm with is not the one that I'm dreaming of.
Bread and wine bread and wine won't you please be my bread and wine.
Bread and wine bread and wine won't you please be my bread and wine. <start> No if and's but's or maybe's
So you wanna be her baby
I can read your face like a book
Yeah it looks easy to love her but believe me brother
It's harder than it looks
She's as pretty as a picture
Every bit as funny as she is smart
Got a smile that'll hold you together
And a touch that'll tear you apart
When she's yours she brings the sunshine
When she's gone the world goes dark
Yeah she's heaven on the eyes
But boy she's hell on the heart yea
Yeah she's good when she's bad
She's cute when she's mad
And she does all the wrong things right
Yeah boy it's a fact when they're made like that
You ain't ever gonna sleep at night
She's as pretty as a picture
Every bit as funny as she is smart
Got a smile that'll hold you together
And a touch that'll tear you apart
When she's yours she brings the sunshine
When she's gone the world goes dark
Yeah she's heaven on the eyes
But boy she's hell on the heart
Once you feel her touch and you've felt that rush
It's gonna mess up your head
But here's the kicker son
Your old ticker's gonna beat you half to death
She's as pretty as a picture
Every bit as funny as she is smart
Got a smile that'll hold you together
And a touch that'll tear you apart
When she's yours she brings the sunshine
When she's gone the world goes dark
Yeah she's heaven on the eyes
But boy she's hell on the heart
Yeah she's hell on the heart <start> Last time I laid eyes on you I was burnin' your photograph
That's the drastic kinda things you do
When you're livin' through the aftermath of a love gone bad
I changed the locks upon the rock that I waited so long to wear
In a desperate search to finally purge myself of the love we shared
And just when I'm gettin' there here you come like a train out of nowhere
You've gotta a lot a nerve showin' your face round here
Told you to stay stay away but you won't but you don't
Just like a voodoo shadow slippin' in between the cracks
I thought I'd chained your memory to a railroad track
Look over my shoulder turn around baby you're back
A big mistake was all you were like a stain from a bad tattoo
Shed my skin start again but you keep on bleedin' through
That's what you do there ain't no gettin' rid of you
You've gotta a lot a nerve showin' you're face round here
Told you to stay stay away but you won't but you don't
Just like a voodoo shadow slippin' in between the cracks
I thought I'd chained your memory to a railroad track
Look over my shoulder turn around baby you're back
Just like a voodoo shadow slippin' in between the cracks
I thought I'd chained you're memory to a railroad track
Thought the wheels would roll it flat
Look over my shoulder turn around baby you're back
Hey yeah baby you're back
Look over my shoulder turn around baby you're back
Baby you're back
Turn around baby you're back
Hey yeah baby you're back
Yeah baby <start> And I wake up in the mornin'
With my hair down in my eyes and she says hi
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are goin' off to school goodbye
And she reaches out and takes my hand
And squeezes it and says how you feeling hon
And I look across at smilin' lips
That warm my heart and see my morning sun
And if that's not lovin' me then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
There's no such thing as Doctor Suess
And Disneyland and Mother Goose is no nursery rhyme
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when myself is feelin' low
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind
Sometimes I call her up at home knowing she's busy
And ask her if she'd get away
And meet me and maybe we could grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doin'
And she hurries down to meet me oh I'm always late
But she sits waitin' patiently
And smiles when she first sees me cause she's made that way
And if that ain't lovin' me then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes
And there's no such think as make believe
Puppy dogs and autumn leaves and BB guns
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes
There's no such think as make believe
Puppy dogs and autumn leaves and BB guns <start> Somethin' 'bout the way she's wearing her dress a little tighter
Somethin' 'bout the way she's starin'she's lookin' to start a fire
Somethin' 'bout the way she's dancin' and drinkin' chilled patron
If she's lonely now she won't be lonely long
Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It's too late too bad she's too far gone
He should've thought of that before he left her all alone
If she's lonely now she won't be lonely long
Somethin' 'bout the way she's blushin'you can tell she isn't sure
Let you know she's up to something she's never done before
Tonight she wants to hold a stranger but not the one at home
If she's lonely now she won't be lonely long
Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It's too late too bad she's too far gone
He should've thought of that before he left her all alone
If she's lonely now she won't be lonely long
If I had a woman like that
Man I'd let her know
I'd hold her tight
I'd hold her close
Do anything do everything to let her know
She'd never ever be alone
Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It's too late too bad she's too far gone
He should've thought of that before he left her all alone
If she's lonely now Lord if she's lonely now
If she's lonely now she won't be lonely long <start> How many days
How many ways
Do I have to lose you
'Til you're gone
How many nights
How many lonely nights
Do I have to lose you darlin'
'Til you're gone
It happens every time
I think I'm gettin' over you
Something 'bout somebody new
Gets me thinkin' about you
How many times
How many times
Do I have to lose you
'Til you're gone
I see you on the Late Show
I hear you on the radio
Darlin' everywhere I go
Your memory is there
How many times
How many times
Do I have to lose you
'Til you're gone
 I wanna know

Do I have to lose you Darlin'...'til you're gone

How many days.....how many nights.....'til you're gone
 I wanna know
 I wanna know Darlin' <start> Over there in the shadows hangin' out in the corner of my mind
Stringing up the gallows waiting for me to cross that line
That man's dangerous as hell a threat to himself
If he got out there'd be hell to pay.
And that's why my dark side don't ever see the light of day.
I've slowed down on the whiskey 'cause there always comes a point
When I've had too many tear down every wall in that joint
I've got a wife I've got a son that don't know half the stuff I've done
And I pray that's the way that it stays
And that's why my dark side don't ever see the light of day
You can blame it on the rebel raisin' you can blame it on the South
You can blame it on the words I try to keep here in my mouth
It takes a lot to start me up but once that hammer drops
You don't wanna be the one that tries to make me stop
All you thugs and ugly mugs dealing drugs and making noise
You can kill each other all you want but if you touch my little boy
You'll be beggin' for this bullet will be the last thing that you see
Before I let my dark side... Come out to play. <start> Gene Clark

She walked into my life with her cold evil eyes

With the length of her mind she darked the sun and
D A D
With the length of her mind she darked the sun <start> There are witches in the hills calling my name
Saying come join us sister come kiss the flame
Come dance in the moonbeams ride the night wind
Make love to the darkness and laugh at man's sins
I shiver with delight I shiver with fear
My heart wants to go but my soul's filled with fear
So I turn to my lover and ask what do I do
Do I answer their call or stay here with you
But under spell of deep sleep he moans and turns away
Taking his protection and my desire to stay
So I rise to the hill tops I ride the night winds
I make love to the darkness and laugh at man's sins <start> Have you heard the news It's raining on the moon
The man in the TV said It's raining on the moon
Even the scientists can't believe it's true
They're showing diagrams and little moon cartoons
Where we are is everything we know
All we've got is the love that we show
It was a man who knew that none of this was true
He swore by God above the end was coming soon
Now there's a rocket bus leaves every afternoon
And funny little cars racin' on the dunes
Where we are is everything we know
All we've got is the love that we show
Everyone aboard it's raining on the moon

Everyone aboard it's raining on the moon

Everyone aboard it's raining on the moon

Everyone aboard it's raining on the moon

Everyone aboard it's raining on the moon

Everyone aboard it's raining on the moon
 <start> I hear a call
Now will answer
Forsake my all
To serve another
Though darkness falls
Stay a believer
I hear a call
Now will answer
I see a light Now will I follow
Fill up this life
That grows more hollow
Make joy reside
Where there lives sorrow
I see a light
Now will follow
I hear a call
From out of nowhere
And from anywhere I go
I hear a call
Now will answer
I feel a touch
Now will I hold on
Be there with love
For those with no one
With a kindness such
It lives though I'm gone
I feel a touch
Now will I hold on <start> Woke up this morning
Happy as could be
Looked out my window
And what did I see
A comin' up my sidewalk
Just as plain as day
A well a here come trouble that I never thought I'd see
When you went away
Hello trouble come on in
You talk about heartaches
Where'n the world ya been
I ain't had the miseries
Since you been gone
Hello trouble trouble trouble
Welcome home
We'll make a pot of coffee
And you can rest your shoes
A you can tell me them sweet lies
And I'll listen to you
For I'm just a little part of
Of the life you've lived
But I'd rather have a little bit of trouble
Than to never know the love you give
Hello trouble come on in
You talk about heartaches
Where'n the world ya been
I ain't had the miseries
Since you been gone
Hello trouble trouble trouble
Welcome home <start> Let's drink a toast to what might've been
To all that we were but can't be again
And let's just be thankful we parted as friends
Here's to the past let the future begin
Oh and here's to your wildest dreams
And here's to your everything
May your life be blessed with sweet happiness
Baby here's to your wildest dreams
I made a promise that I wouldn't cry
You go and chase your rainbows go on reach for the sky
But come hold me close now look deep in my eyes
Tell me you love me then kiss me goodbye
Oh and here's to your wildest dreams baby
And here's to your everything
May your life be blessed with sweet happiness
Baby here's to your wildest dreams
Ill always love you and I'm on your side
In whatever you do I will take pride
And here's to your wildest dreams baby
And here's to your everything
May your life be blessed with sweet happiness
Baby here's to your wildest dreams
Baby here's to your wildest dreams
Dream on baby <start> Midnight in Montgomery
Silver Eagle Lonely Road
I was on my way to Mobile
For a big new year's eve show
Stopped for just a minute
To see a friend outside of town
With my collar up I found his name
And felt the wind die down
And a drunk man in a cowboy hat
Took me by surprise
Wearin' shiny boots a nudie suit and haunted haunted eyes
He said friend it's good to see you
It's nice to know ya care
Then the wind picked up and he was gone
Was he ever really there
Chorus
'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that wipperwill
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right
You'll hear his song
Smell whisky in the air
Midnight in montgomery
He's always singin' there
Well I climbed back on that eagle
Took one last look around
Red tail lights shadow moves slow across the ground
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passin' by
I can hear that wistle moanin'
I'm so lonesome I could cry
Chorus
He's always singin there
Well Hank's always singin' there. <start> Oh why you look so sad
the Tears are in your eyes
Come on and come to me now
Don't be ashamed to cry
Let me see you through
'Cause I've seen the dark side too
When the night falls on you
You don't know what to do
Nothing you confess
Could make me love you less
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
I won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
So if you're mad get mad
Don't hold it all inside
Come on and talk to me now
Hey what you got to hide
I get angry too
Well I'm a lot like you
When you're standing at the crossroads
And don't know which path to choose
Let me come along
'Cause even if you're wrong
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
I won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you
And when when the night falls on you baby
You're feeling all alone
You won't be on your own
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
I won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you
Oh I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you <start> I know you said when I left
I'd regret every word every breathe every step every minute without you
Go do what you have to
I know I said you were wrong I'd move on
It was only a matter of time til I'd make it without you
But this wasn't about you
I said I needed space a change of place to go out and live my life
Chorus
I don't wanna live without you anymore
And what I wouldn't give to get us back to the way it was before
I admit I was wrong all along now you're gone with all that I'd been living for
I don't wanna live without you anymore
For a couple of nights I was fine
I was high off the wine and the lights and my new found freedom that I thought I needed
But that cold lonely room that I headed home to it felt like a tomb
I just stared at the ceiling what an empty feeling
And baby I apologize and tell me its not too late
Chorus x
No I don't wanna live without you anymore <start> Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today...
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace...
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
Maybe someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world... <start> I wanna run away
Don't come out looking 'round
Too busy dealing with it on my own
He's right behind me
Please God I can't be found
Don't cast another stone
Feel out the night until the sunrise
The city tells me not to go 'til dawn
And if he wakes that's when my heart breaks
And I'm as good as gone
How do I lie awake now
When I know I've got to be moving on
How do I lie awake now
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong
And in the end
Will we make our amends
Just like we're face to face another dawn
And in the light or when the moon shines
Will you take me on home
How do I lie awake now
When I know I've got to be moving on
How do I lie awake now
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong <start> Gotta lotta blues to lose yes by now you've heard the news
Cause it's all over town that you've made me a fool and a clown
Gotta lotta blues to lose and I'm wearin' out my shoes
Just to walkin' around in this lonely ole town gotta lotta blues to lose
I don't know where to start pickin' up my heart
You've shattered it in little bitty pieces
I gotta lotta tears to cry a lotta memories that must die
And if I take it slow I'll forget you I know gotta lotta blues to lose
I don't know where to start
I gotta lotta blues to lose I gotta lotta blues to lose <start> When you live in the country everybody is your neighbor
On this one thing you can rely
They'll all come to see you and they'll never ever leave you
Why'all come to see us bye and bye
Why'all come  why'all come 
Oh you all come to see us when you can
Why'all come  why'all come 
Oh you all come to see us now and then
Now Grandma's awishing you'd come out the kitchen
And help do the dishes right away
Then they all start aleaving and though she's agrieving
You can still hear grandma say
Why'all come  why'all come 
Oh you all come to see us when you can
Why'all come  why'all come 
Oh you all come to see us now and then <start> I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All the sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain
If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you
So though the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain
Raindrops falling from heaven
Will never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
Someday when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then darling you'll never see me complain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain <start> Far across the blue waters
Lives an old German's daughter
By the banks of the old river Rhine
Where I loved her and left her
But I can't forget her
'Cause I miss my pretty Fraulein
Fraulein Fraulein
Look up toward the heavens each night
When the stars seem to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
You are my pretty Fraulein
When my memories wander
Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
A face comes before me
The face of my pretty Fraulein
Fraulein Fraulein
Walk down by the river
Pretend that your hand's holding mine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you <start> Long John walkin' around in the rain
He's long gone Lost John
Long gone Lost John
No hat on his head no shoes on his feet
He's a beggin the women for his meat
I had an ol' dog and his name was
like a rabbit through Bowlin' Green <start>  trumpet 
Now the morning sun streaks across my room
And I'm wakened up from another dream of you
Yes I'm on the road once again it seems
All I've left behind is a chain of broken dreams
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you
How I wish this love was all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have cause I've got so much to give
And it seems so wrong deep inside my heart
That the dollar sign should be keeping us apart
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you
If only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life had not yet crossed our minds
For the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you
But you know we can't live on dreams alone
Got to pay the rent got to leave you all alone
But you know I made my choice many years ago
Now this traveling life is the only life I know
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you <start> I'm back in baby's arms how I've missed those lovin' arms
I'm back where I belong back in baby's arms
Don't know why we quarrel we never did before
Since we found out how it hurts I bet we never quarrel anymore
I'm back in baby's arms
Thought I didn't need his love till its chips'd get away
Now I'm back where I belong and in my baby's arms I'm gonna stay
I'm back in baby's arms
I'm back in my baby's arms <start> Let me be a little kinder let me be a little blinder
To the faults of those about me let me praise a little more
Let me be when I am weary just a little bit more cheery
Think a little more of others and a little less of me
Let me be a little braver when temptation bits me waver
Let me strive a little harder to be all that I should be
Let me be a little meeker with the brother who is weaker
Think a little more of others and a little less of me
Let me be when I am weary just a little bit more cheery
Let me serve a little better those that I am striving for
Let me be a little meeker with the brother who is weaker
Think a little more of others and a little less of me
Think a little more of others and a little less of me <start> Lord on bended knee I'm begging you
Let me feel just a little of what you went through
Oh I want to know just how greater cost
Let me live let me live at the foot of the cross
With broken heart Lord show me the way
To have more compassion for those gone astray
Oh give me desire for souls that are lost
Let me live let me live at the foot of the cross
Please let me live where you died for me give me a vision of calvary
Let me reach out and touch  oh I need a reminder to be what I should
Give me more desire for souls that are lost
Let me live let me live at the foot of the cross <start> Katie Queen
Of Tennessee
I'm on my knees
Unworthy
What shall be
Our destiny
To find true love or tragedy
If you see me runnin'
Through the streets I'm calling
Into love I'm falling
Katie be my darlin'
And If you hear the sirens
I hope you find it charming
I'll be out in the mornin'
Katie be my darlin'
If only she
Would notice me
What can I do
To make her see
That I would swim
The ocean wide
From New Orleans
To Galilee
If you see me runnin'
Through the streets I'm calling
Into love I'm falling
Katie be my darlin'
And If you hear the sirens
I hope you find it charming
I'll be out in the mornin'
Katie be my darlin'
Oh Katie queen of Tennessee
My Katie queen of Tennessee
Tell me who I have to be
To be the one beside you dear
If you see me runnin'
Through the streets I'm calling
Into love I'm falling
Katie be my darlin'
And If you hear the sirens
I hope you find it charming
I'll be out in the mornin'
Katie be my darlin' <start> You say there's someone new
Well Baby that ain't news
Tell me something I don't know
You say your love has died
Well baby that's right
Tell me something I don't know
This may come as a surprise to you
But I'm not surprised at what you say you're gonna do
When you say you're leaving me
I ain't so blind that I can't see
Tell me something I don't know
I saw it coming from a mile away
I wasn't born yesterday
Tell me something I don't know
You say the feelings you once had are gone
This ain't where you belong
Tell me something I don't know
Before you sit me down to tell me more
You oughta know I packed your bags
And they're waiting at the door.
So before you're on your way
If you've anything left to say
Tell me something I don't know
You say you're sorry now for breaking every vow
That's a good one baby
Go ahead and take a bow
You say there's someone new
Well baby that ain't news
Tell me something I don't know
You say your love is gone
Well Baby go on tell me something I don't know
Baby go on tell me something I don't know
Baby go on tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
Baby go on <start> I've always said I do too easy
And now I'm payin' the price.
A weakness for beautiful women
Is my most expensive vice.
I still believe in matrimony
But I can't afford another try.
Child support and alimony
Is just about to bleed me dry.
I've got ex's all across the country
And I owe everybody in town.
I've got bill collectors callin' me up
And lawyers tryin' to track me down.
I'm just one wrong move from the poor house
But I don't belong in there.
I've got so many ex's and owe so much
I ought to be on Hollywood Squares
Yeah I ought to be on Hollywood Squares.
Lookin' back over my love life
I only have myself to blame.
I guess I should've checked the price tag
Before I gave 'em my last name.
Now my credit ratin's in the gutter
And the bottom line sure looks bad.
I'll be payin' the rest of my life
For the few good times I've had.
I've got ex's all across the country
And I owe everybody in town.
I've got bill collectors callin' me up
And lawyers tryin' to track me down.
I'm just one wrong move from the poor house
But I don't belong in there.
I've got so many ex's and owe so much
I ought to be on Hollywood Squares
Yeah they ought to put me on Hollywood Squares. <start> She was a good companion eyes like the Grand Canyon
She was an American beauty
She was a long goodbye she was the best alibi
She was an American beauty
With her Wayfarers on in the summer sun
Her touch felt like a loaded gun
Wish I had held her longer
Wish I had held her long
A gorgeous vagabond she was sweet but she was strong
She was an American beauty
She was dj vu she was a catch
She was an American beauty
Her blue eyes shine in the summer sun
Her kiss felt like a loaded gun
Wish I had held her longer
Wish I had held her long
Goodbye came like the morning sun
She fired shots from a loaded gun
Wish I had held her longer
Wish I had held her long
She was a good companion
Eyes like the Grand Canyon
She was an American beauty <start> I was born in Saginaw Michigan.
I grew up in a house on Saginaw Bay.
My dad was a poor hard working Saginaw fisherman
Too many times he came home with too little pay.
I loved a girl in Saginaw Michigan.
The daughter of a wealthy wealthy man.
But he called me That son of a Saginaw fisherman.
And not good enough to claim his daughter's hand.
Now I'm up here in Alaska looking around for gold.
Like a crazy fool I'm a digging in this frozen ground so cold.
But with each new day I pray I'll strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw Michigan.
I wrote my love in Saginaw Michigan.
I said Honey I'm a coming home please wait for me.
And you can tell your dad I'm coming back a richer man
I've hit the biggest strike in Klondyke history.
Her dad met me in Saginaw Michigan.
He gave me a great big party with champagne.
Then he said Son you're wise young ambitious man.
Will you sell your fatherinlaw your Klondyke claim
Now he's up there in Alaska digging in the cold cold ground.
The greedy fool is a looking for the gold I never found.
It serves him right and noone here is missing him.
Least of all the newlyweds of Saginaw Michigan.
We're the happiest man and wife in Saginaw Michigan.
He's ashamed to show his face in Saginaw Michigan. <start> On the way out I'm thinkin'
You get what you take anyway
On the way out you're watchin'
Wonder if I am gonna pay

Thanks a lot

On the way out I'm smilin'
Look nice you might be photographed
On the way out you're thinkin'
Looks like he never put it back

Take two put one down
Don't think ya saw it
Back home another day

Who needs that anyway

On the way out I'm thinkin'
You get what you take anyway
On the way out you're watchin'
Wonder if I am gonna pay

On the way out
On the way out <start> IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF TEXAS EAST AND WEST OF EL PASO
WHERE THE MIGHTY FRANKLIN MOUNTAINS GUARD THE TRAIL TO MEXICO
THERE'S A NEWMADE WIDOW CRYING AND A HEARSE A ROLLIN SLOW
I GUESS THE DEVILS PASSED THIS WAY AGAIN
THERE'S A LATHERED SORREL STALLION RUNNING THRU THE JOSHUA TREES
AND A YOUNG MAN IN THE SADDLE WITH HIS COAT TAILS IN THE BREEZE
HE'S GOT A SIX GUN ON HIS RIGHT HIP AND A RIFLE AT HIS KNEES
AND HE'S DEALING IN A GAME THAT HE CAN'T WIN
CHORUS
POOR BILLY BONNEY YOU'RE ONLY 
PAT GARRETT'S GOT YOUR NAME ON EVERY BULLET IN HIS GUN
EVERY NOTCH YOU CARVE ON YOUR SIX GUN
HAS A BLOODY TALE TO TELL
YOU'RE A MILE AHEAD OF GARRETT AND A STEP OUTSIDE OF HELL
THOSE FANCY CLOTHES YOUR WEARIN AND THE WOMEN IN YOUR BED
CAN'T TAKE AWAY THE TRACES OF THE MEN THAT YOU'VE LEFT DEAD
AS YOU RIDE ACROSS THE BAD LANDS WITH A PRICE UPON YOUR HEAD
AND NOW THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE STARTS TO Turn
YOU'RE REPUTATION'S GROWN TILL IT'S THE BIGGEST IN THE LAND
AND THERE AIN'T ALOT OF PEOPLE LEFT WHO WANT TO CALL YOUR HAND
AND I GUESS YOU'LL GO DOWN SHOOTIN AND LIKE ALL BRANDED MEN
WHEN YOU SHAKE HANDS WITH THE DEVIL YOU GET BURNED
CHORUS <start> I was the one
Who was undone till you picked me up
So how did you fall so far from it all
Thought you were my rock
So why do you push me away
I'm not gonna stand here and watch you go down
I love you too much no I won't let you drown
And it just comes with being the man that I am
So forgive me forgive me for giving a damn
Listen to me I can't compete with this trip you're on
And if you decide to take that ride I won't come along
'Cause I know just where it leads
I'm not gonna stand here and watch you go down
I love you too much no I won't let you drown
And it just comes with being the man that I am
So forgive me forgive me for giving a damn
I know you're scared and you just wanna run
'Cause I've been there
I know where you're coming from
I'm not gonna stand here and watch you go down
I love you too much no I won't let you drown
And it just comes with being the man that I am
So forgive me forgive me for giving a damn
Forgive me for giving a damn <start> On a trading path through the Carolinas
Used by Indians who braved the wind and rain
They settled down beside the raging waters
And they worked the land until the white men came
And formed the counties
And they took away their land
And made the boundaries
Governed with a heavy hand
And you can almost hear the song
Of that old Indian longing for his home
Along the waters edge
Climbing mountains to escape
The laws of white men
Walking softly in the rain and talking to the wind
They were friendly and they rode on painted horses
Fearing no one not harming anything
They were trusting when the pilgrims came to live here
And then they died by the hands of the men
Who formed the counties
And they took away their land
And made the boundaries
Governed with a heavy hand
And you can almost hear that sad song
Of that old Indian crying for his home
Along the waters edge
Climbing mountains to escape
The laws of white men
Walking softly in the rain and talking to the wind
They were trusting when they taught us how to live here
And then they scattered to the wind leaving only tears behind them
And an old forgotten art
And all their memories dying with a broken heart
And you almost hear the song
Of that old Indian longing for his home
Along that waters edge
Climbing mountains to escape
The laws of white men
Walking softly in the rain talking to the wind <start> Nobody loves a drink anymore than me I might buy a round or two or three
And I've been known to stumble and hit the floor
Oh but I'm never too drunk to make it to the door
Red wine can start my head a swimmin' but I draw the line when it comes to women
I never met a woman that could make me roam and I do my swinging at home
She gives me more love better love sweeter love true love and that's where I belong
I might do a lotta talking but soon you'll see me walking
Cause I do my swinging at home
She gives me more love better love sweeter love true love and that's where I belong
I might do a lotta talking but soon you'll see me walking
I do a lotta swinging a lotta love song singing but I do my swinging at home <start> I JUST HAD YOU ON MY MIND

Talking to a hotel mirror with my glasses off
Now you know just what he's crying about

Where'd you learn to talk that way
I look like James Mason's ghost
Talking to a friend after school but you don't see
That she's really looking right at me yeah yeah yeah
Dolores was her middle name
And now her mother's wondering

Paint her lovely toenails red

I'd let the air release my mind
And leave my worries far behind
And let the silent oceans of the sky's
Wash every grain of sorrow from my eyes
If only I had wings
I'd fly beyond the rainbows door
In search of heavens stardust shore
Where long forgotten dreams
will all come true
Beyond the mellow oceans tender blue
I'm flying
up where the eagle reigns
I'm flying
leaving behind my chains
If only I had wings
upon the breeze I'd lay my soul
And let god's hand take full control
And sing my hearts surrender to his love
Forever to the moon and stars above
I'm flying
up where the eagle reigns
I'm flying
leaving behind my chains
Music
And let the silent oceans of the sky's
Wash every grain of sorrow from my eyes
If only I had wings.......
If only I had wings....... <start> Girl I've been waitin' on this long hard day to get over
So I can rest my head right here on your shoulder
I just wanna lay here and feel ya breathe
Listen to the rhythm of your heartbeat
And see where it leads
We're wide awake but girl I wanna make you close your eyes
And say my name like only you can say it and hold me tight
All I need is only you and me alone tonight
I wanna make you close your eyes
Oh yeah
You can make me work for it girl if you want to
Just leave a trail for me to follow you into the bedroom
And if you need a little bit of help from me
Babe there's not a button that I can't reach
Let's see where it leads
We're wide awake but girl I wanna make you close your eyes
And say my name like only you can say it and hold me tight
All I need is only you and me alone tonight
I wanna make you close your eyes
I wanna take you somewhere out there
'Til the world fades out of sight
We're wide awake but girl I wanna make you close your eyes
And say my name like only you can say it and hold me tight
Just hold me tight
All I need is only you and me alone tonight
Yeah I wanna make you close your eyes

She come down from oklahoma with her browneyed pride and joy
The fairhaired desdemona and her ramblin guitar boy
Well they kept to thornbrake thickets 'cause her daddy was a logchain man
Yeah they kept to thornbrake thickets 'cause her daddy was a logchain man
On a night as long and wicked as the scar on his tattooed hand
Fly away fly away little wildwood flower
Lift your cares to the wind coyote and whine
Your rolling tears your restless visions
Rattle up to love the magician
Well he tracked 'em by the muddy waters and he trailed 'em by the lonely lake
Yeah he tracked 'em by the muddy waters and he trailed 'em by the lonely lake
But he only saw two young otters swimmin over by the farther bank
Fly away fly away ...
They stole through the headhigh blossoms when he set his hound dogs run
Yeah they stole through the headhigh blossoms when he set his hound dogs run
And they dogs treed two white possoms at the risin of an angry sun
Fly away fly away ...
When the old man come to find 'em there wasn't nothin for to meet the eye
When the old man come to find 'em there wasn't nothin for to meet the eye
Just a pair of lovebirds risin in the blue and boundless sky <start> I'm going to let you fall
Let you go to the natural law
The natural law Like Clay in my hand
Like the tumbling clear waves on the sand
the waves on the sand
Taking light of this body
this body
And all your trust passes that surrounded me yeah
I let the arrow fly and this truth pours from me
and shatters everything
I never thought that I could stand before you
right where I stood right where I stood
right where I stood
cuz everywhere I go
The moon and stars surround me like a dome
round me like a dome
Like a dome
Taking light of this body
this body and your trespasses that surrounded me
yeah I let the arrow of this truth fly from me
I let the arrow fly and this truth pours from me
And shatters everything <start> I suppose there's a better way to make a livin'
To make money so I could live in luxury
But the life behind a desk in a building
Would be like a prison sentence to me
My manners are not refined or even polished
And my speech it may be crude to most you see
I guess that I was just born a dreamer
But in my life I relish pride and being free
My clothes are high heeled boots and a big hat
And the buckle on my belt I wear with pride
You might even find a snuff can in the pocket of these old wore out faded
Blue Levi's
Well I'm a cowboy
On the rodeo circuit
And when it's time to ride Well I bear down and try
But when I play I go to some ol' crowded bar room
And get drunk  wild along with the other guys
Well I know it can't go on like this forever
And I maybe a fool just runnin' wild through life
But it's my life and I'll live it to the fullest
And I can look back and say that it was right
And some day when my rovin' days are finally all over
Well I can picture a little home down beside a stream
And with a son and his mother sittin' by me and with love I'll help him to
Strive to reach his dream.
Good Cowgirls keep their calves together <start> Seems like I relied too hard on a dream
Now tell me girl where have you really been
'Cause I've only got this life right here
Wasted all and contain all the fear
But I caught your eye on a Friday night
I removed myself and got caught up in loose nights
So ask me again yes lets meet again
You know I've built a kingdom on second chances yes I did.
Well I've been there now once or twice
Now tell me girl did you think that was very nice
And I would say it was just one moment
But it was gone just as fast as it came
So I drowned myself in a tall glass of whatever
Does it matter to you
And the tears would come with the cold cold rain
And I know for sure that I succumb to the pain
And I'd love to tear apart your name
Piece by piece frame by frame
Well I'd love to tear apart your name
I'd love to tear apart your days
Piece by piece and frame by frame and piece by piece frame by frame <start> It's a long trip alone over sand and stone
That lie along the road that we all must travel down
So maybe you could walk with me a while
And maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Everybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to hold
'Cause it's a long trip alone
It's a short piece of time but just enough to find
A little peace of mind under the sun somewhere
So maybe you could walk with me a while
And maybe I could rest beneath your smile
You know we can't afford to let one moment pass us by
'Cause it's a short piece of time
And I don't know where I'd be without you here
'Cause I'm not really me without you there
Yeah yeah
Hallelujah hallelujah oh
So maybe you could walk with me a while
Maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Everybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to hold
So maybe you could walk with me a while
Maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Maybe I could feel right beside you till I'm home
'Cause it's a long trip alone a long trip alone <start> I CAN'T GET OVER YOU

Beneath the silver moon with my banjo right in tune
My heart is ever true I love no one but you
My Dixie darlin' my Dixie dream
A way down below the MasonDixon Line
Down where the honeysuckles are entwined
There's where the southern winds are blowin'
There's where the daisies growin'
Girls of the North in their gay finery
Whirlin' around in their society
Singin' a song of Dixie darlin'
Where I long to be
My Dixie darlin' listen to this song I sing
Beneath the silver moon with my banjo right in tune
My heart is ever true I love no one but you
My Dixie darlin' my Dixie dream
I'm goin' down south to have a big time
See my boy in ol' Caroline
I'll drink his booze do as I please
All them boys I long to squeeze
Singin' the song of Dixie darlin'
There's where I long to be goin'
Down where the jelly roll's growin'
With my Dixie dream
My Dixie darlin' listen to this song I sing
Beneath the silver moon with my banjo right in tune
My heart is ever true I love no one but you

Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
No there ain't enough
Matches I can strike
To set afire the memory of you
Up goes down
Right's gone left me behind
Wheels spin 'round
Reverse stuck in my mind
There ain't enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
No there ain't enough
Bottles I could break
To make 'em feel as broken as I do
Stack up every barrel
Since the day it was made
Satisfaction guaranteed to kill the pain
But there ain't enough
Kisses from a stranger
On a long wild night to ever make it alright
If it ain't you
In my arms in my bed
Yeah to hell with all the rest
Once you've had the best nothing else will do
What's the use
There ain't enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
No there ain't enough
Bottles I could drink
To make 'em feel as empty as I do
With my mouth wide open
In a whiskey rain
I could stand there  hours a day
But there ain't enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
No there ain't enough
Bottles I could drink
To make 'em feel as empty as I do
No there ain't enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
So forget you <start> Another love has ended 
Like so many in the past 
And people now are saying 
I just knew it couldn't last 
Another fool is suffering 
In a world of despair 
Trying not to show 
How much he really cared 
Another promise spoken 
To love forever more 
And then my heart was broken 
Like so many hearts before 
The hand of fate descended
Another love has ended
When a new love started for you
Another promise spoken 
To love forever more 
And then my heart was broken 
Like so many hearts before 
The hand of fate descended
Another love has ended
When a new love started for you
When a new love started for you  <start> I supposed I ought to say congratulations for you've won the only girl I ever loved
But I've hurt too much to face the situation
Just take good care of her take good care of her
Just to be around her was my greatest pleasure
She was everything my future held in store
So remember when you take my only treasure
Please take good care of her take good care of her
I must accepted she loves you more than me
So with my broken heart I'll bow out gracefuly
Please don't send me any wedding invitations
For I couldn't dare to see her there with you
If she's happy that will be my consolation
So take good care of her take good care of her <start> She called me baby baby all night long used to hold and kiss me till the dawn
Then one day I awoke and she was gone ah there's no more baby baby all night long
Well she called me baby baby all night long lift me up so high and made me strong
Well what I'd give if she'd just come back home and call me baby baby all night long
Yeah she called me baby baby all night long
Kissed my tears away when things went wrong
But now each night in dreams just like a song I still hear baby baby all night long
But there's no more baby baby all night long <start> Well I left my home down on a rural route I told my folks I'm goin' steppin' out
Forget the honky tonk blues hey the honky tonk blues

Gonna tuck my worries underneath my arm get right back to my pappy's farm

Don't want to be bothered with the honky tonk blues <start> You look at me that way I know what your eyes say
Your eyes reflect love and desire
I see that you need me I need you to please me
You touch me and set me on fire
The way that you love me the way that you touch me
The way that you whisper my name
I cannot resist you each time I kiss you
Then everything goes up in flames
Baby I'm burnin' out of control baby I'm burnin' body and soul
Hot as a pistol that flamin' desire baby I'm burnin' you've got me on fire
I'm on fire
This red hot emotion puts fireworks in motion
It looks like the th of July
There's no use in fighting this fire you've ignited
Just stand back and watch the sparks fly
Baby I'm burnin' out of control...
Baby I'm burnin' baby I'm burnin' baby I'm burnin' baby I'm burnin'
Baby I'm burnin' out of control...
Baby I'm burnin' out of control... <start> I'm finally holding what I been hoping for
We had a few drinks
Some laughs at the bar
Stayed out too late
And went a little too far
Oh but wakin' up
With you on my chest
I had a pounding heart and achin' head and no regrets
Who knows we might go down in flames
Then again I might just change your name
Could it be I'm finally holding
What I've been hoping for
Could it be the end of just friends
The start of something more
Oh the way I'm feeling now
It's worth sticking around to see
Is this love
Or could it be
Rule number one
Friends don't break
We could write it off
As a sweet mistake
Only time will tell
If we were wrong or right
All I know is I don't want to be alone tonight
Who knows we might go down in flames
Then again I might just change your name
Could it be I'm finally holding
What I've been hoping for
Could it be the end of just friends
The start of something more
Oh the way I'm feeling now
It's worth sticking around to see
Is this love
Or could it be
We wound up here so naturally
Me and you baby
You and me
Could it be
Could it be
Could it be I'm finally holding
What I've been hoping for
Could it be the end of just friends
The start of something more
Oh the way I'm feeling now
It's worth sticking around to see
Is this love
Or could it be
Is this love
Or could it be <start> Well if you got a Cadillac boy
And a forty room shack boy.
A bucket full of money
And a tree full of honey.
But if you gettin' no huggin'
No smoochin' or a muggin'.
Well if you ain't lovin'
Then you ain't livin'.
Well if you're ridin' on the gravy train
Instead of walkin' down lovers lane.
You can't make hay boy
You're goin' the wrong way boy.
You gotta get a little honey
For it's better than money.
Well if you ain't lovin'
Then you ain't livin'.
Well if they call you a big big man
'Cause you got a lot of bottom land.
If you're kin to the president
And if you help run the government.
But if you get no attention
You better off on a pension.
For if you ain't lovin'
Then you ain't livin'.
Well if you got a string of long long cars
And you're smokin' them fourbit cigars.
Well you ain't so well to do
Unless you get a little coochycoo.
It takes a little of smackin'
Or your life is a lackin'.
Well if you ain't lovin'
Then you ain't livin'... <start> Chorus
You're as slow as christmas I was up before the dawn
Up so fast I missed it or was that old saying wrong
Every christmas day makes every other day seem long
And what seemed would never get here
Has so quickly come and gone
Verse one
I've heard old sayings old cliches and
Most of them make sense
But we're wiser in our younger days not easily convinced
There's no way to look ahead with the wool over your eyes
And it seems that santa's sled isn't the only thing that flies

Verse two
We're bringing in another year let's throw the old one back
With my new train I'll be the engineer
And hurry down the track
While I know that time is standing still
I hear that old cliche
And I'm more convinced it does until that
One december day
Chorus two
When I'm as slow as christmas
I'll be up before the dawn
I'm gonna miss this
I know that old saying's wrong
Every christmas day makes other day seem long
And what seemed would never get here
Has so quickly come and gone
Come and gone <start> We made love but where's the love we made
We made love but you couldn't prove it now
Suddenly I feel alone and so afraid
We made love but where's the love we made
It's not in the house anywhere that's for sure we've looked everywhere that we know
By the fireplace even in our bedroom that's where I remember it last
Yeah and I hate to say it but I don't even see it in your eyes anymore
It seems we just woke up one day and our future is part of the past
We made love but where's the love we made
It's not in this little cafe where we met
We went there and couldn't even find it in the wine
I thought we might find it up in the mountains
Remember that little cabin we rented that time
Yeah but it's just disappeared like it never was there
But it was there cause I felt it so strong
It's a little bit crazy and a little bit sad but more than a little bit gone
We made love but where's the love we made... <start> On a two lane north of Casper is where this all begins
Heading back to Oklahoma for a week to visit friends
She was walking 'long the highway so I pulled off to the side
And asked her if she needed a ride
We tore up that ole blacktop 'til we found I
And just into Colorado she asked if she could drive
I'd never met nobody like her. I'd never laughed so much
And I grew hungry for her touch

I used to think of autumn
As sweaters and leaves
And I used to think the night
Was just for dreamers and theives
But that was before she came
Allison Miranda was her name
By the time that we hit Kansas we both felt pretty beat
So we found ourselves a motel and grabbed a bite to eat
We'd rest a few short hours soon we'd be out of there
Three days later we came up for air

Now I can't forget the morning when I woke alone in bed
To a rose left on her pillow and a goodbye note that read
You cannot grow a flower if you do not have the seed
Now I've got everything I need
 <start> I don't love you anymore not the way I did before
And since you've found someone new I think it's best
I don't cry and walk the floor I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you anyless
I don't love you anymore for I've got no more love to give
You drained my heart of all its love with every sweet caress
I keep saying o'er and o'er I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less
 guitar 
I held you close to me one time kissed your lips and called you mine
Then another came and thrilled you more I guess
I cried as you walked out the door I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less
I don't love you anymore...
Trouble is I don't love you any less <start> The river flows it flows to the sea
Wherever that river goes that's where I want to be
Flow river flow let your waters wash down
Take me from this road to some other town
All he wanted was to be free
And that's the way it turned out to be
Flow river flow let your waters wash down
Take me from this road to some other town
Flow river flow past the shady trees
Go river go go to the sea
Flow to the sea
The river flows it flows to the sea
Wherever it goes that's where I want to be
Flow river flow let your waters wash down
Take me from this road to some other town <start> Lonesome number one
Just call me lonesome number one
Although no titles have I won
I surely must be lonesome number one
Every love I've had has faded like a dew
Everyone I wanted has wanted someone new
Heartaches hang around they always come
I surely must be lonesome number one
Lonesome number one
Seems I'm always losing love just can't come near
Just when love gets close it always disappears
Sorrow always keeps me on the run
I surely must be lonesome number one <start> 
Well it's a long lonesome road
Through the lifetime of a trucker
But me and my good ol' friend here
We gonna make it
It's a longhaulin' road
And the load of life is heavy
But me an' this good ol' truck
We gonna take it
Through the wind an' rain an' thunder
'Til the stormy skies are blue
An' the sunrise lights the highway
Headin' home
Well it's a long lonesome road
Through the lifetime of a trucker
But me and this here ol' truck
We gonna make it
Well it's a long lonesome road
And the miles of life are many
But me an' these eighteen wheels
We gonna take it
It's a long way to go
And the road ahead is troubled
But this ol' rig and me
We gonna make it
Through the wind an' rain an' thunder
'Til the stormy skies are blue
An' the sunrise lights the highway
Headin' home
It's long lonesome road
Through the lifetime of a trucker
But this ol' truck and me
We gonna make it
Yeah me and this good ol' friend
We gonna make it <start> Tonight I'm alone without you my dear
It seems there's a longing for you still
All I have to do now is sit alone and cry
In our little cabin home on the hill
Oh someone has taken you from me
And left me here all alone
Just to listen to the rain beat on my window pane
In our little cabin home on the hill
I hope you are happy tonight as you are
But in my heart there's a longing for you still
I just keep it there so I won't be alone
In our little cabin home on the hill
Now when you have come to the end of the way
And find there's no more happiness for you
Just let you thoughts turn back once more if you will
To our little cabin home on the hill <start> To my first pony Cherry Pie
From the little girl you taught to fly
To the sun
To Misses Thorton from third grade
I remember all the times you stayed
Till Daddy picked me up
Oh did you ever know
Did I ever tell you so
Oh I hope you understand
You have so much to do with who I am
To my older brother Wes
I worshiped everything you did and said
I hope it didn't bother you
To Grandma Melva and Grandpa Lin
What I'd give just to be five again
Singin' in your living room
Oh did you ever know
Did I ever tell you so
Oh I hope you understand
You have so much to do with who I am
To Arkansas summer wind
To feelings that never end
To anyone who called me friend
All the blessings from above
To Mama's kiss and Daddy's hugs
I didn't say it near enough
Thank you for who I am
Oh did you ever know
Did I ever tell you so
Oh I hope you understand
You have so much
You have so much to do with who I am
To my first pony Cherry Pie
From the little girl you taught to fly
You taught to fly <start> I'm a simple man living a complex life
I did a whole lot of things all wrong before I learned them right
The first time I felt like a man was in the eye of a storm
Watching the woman I love feeding our first born
Nobody knows about the here and after
What really does and doesn't matter
The question's tough but the answer's simple enough
First comes love first comes love
Take a good long look at her body she's built by God
Sent a charge right through my soul like a lightning rod
But time has a way of beating down passion's flame
It comes on strong and wild then it gets real tame <start> Each night I leave the barroom when it's over
Not feeling any pain at closing time
But tonight you memory found me much to sober
Couldn't drink enough to keep you off my mind
Tonight the bottle let down
And let you memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let down
I've always had a bottle I could turn to
And lately I've been turning everyday
But the wind don't take effect the way it used to
And I'm hurting in an old familiar way
Tonight the bottle let down
And let you memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let down <start> Once again in the world
Of  feelings
All in electric lights
We see what we can
I love the sound wind
Blowing at night through trees
From the roof I can see toons
Past the houses of the city
And I have been yours
In fall and in praying
And I loved to look at you
From the side at night
With music playing
And love will protect you
To the edge of the wood
And a monster will get you
And love does no good <start> Baby all week yeah you and me
Have been raring to go ready for this show.
Got a buzz on and the sun's gone.
You can't see for the crowd let me help you out.
Get up get up get up on my shoulders.
Here take my cuzzi so your can stays colder.
Be my country song singalong beer holder.
Hurry up baby 'fore this song's over.
Get up get up get up on my shoulders.

Where you can outshine that big spotlight
And get the party started.

Get up get up <start> If I could
I would dare
Feed your dreams
And starve your fears
If I could
Light the world
We could sit
And watch it burn
We could fall asleep inside the glow
So tell me what I gotta do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out oh
If I could
Take you in
Feeling you deep
Beneath my skin
Then I could
Slip away
With you as a poison in my veins
I don't wanna fall asleep alone
And wake up knowing that I died without the one
So tell me what I gotta do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out oh
So tell me what I gotta do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out oh
If I could
I would dare
Feed your dreams
And starve your fears <start> The wind is blowing through the pines
Always stealing from me Father Time
Taking from me what was never mine
One more day one more night
Always longing for the past
Taking for granted the time at hand
Every moment like shifting sand
Leaving weary the strongest man
Many fortunes have been gained and lost
Upon the ocean many ships have crossed
Many brilliant souls have lived and died
At the hands of Father Time
I'm not promised another day
Still I'm reckless and time I waste
All my tears cried in vain
Gaining wisdom as beauty fades
Gaining wisdom as beauty fades <start> I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you
Every thunder cloud that came was one more I might not get through
On the darkest day there's always light and now I see it too
But I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you
I hear it falling in the night and filling up my mind
All the heaven's rivers come to light I see it all unwind
I hear it talking through the trees and on the window pane
When I hear it I just can't believe I never liked the rain
Like the rain I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain always calling for you I'm falling for you now
Just like the rain
When the cloud is rolling over thunder striking me
It's as bright as lightning and I wonder why I couldn't see
That it's always good and the flood is gone we still remain
Guess I've known all along I just belong here with you falling
Like the rain I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain always calling for you I'm falling for you now
Just like the rain I have fallen for
I'm falling for you now just like the rain
And when the night falls on our better days
And we're looking to the sky
For te winds to take us high above the plains
I know that we'll find better ways to look into the eye
Of the storms that will be calling
Forever we'll be falling
Like the rain I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain always calling for you I'm falling for you now just
Like the rain I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain always calling for you I'm falling for you now just
Like the rain I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain always calling for you I'm falling for you now just
Like the rain <start> Turn the world around the other way
Back it up and stop on yesterday
Back to before that silly fight
And give me a chance to make things right
I said some things I didn't mean to say
Things that I am sorry for today
Down on my knees I beg you please
To turn the world around the other way
I never really wanted us to break up
And I'm sorry for each teardrop that you cried
We need to give our hearts a chance to make up
And darling will you stand in by my side
We'll turn the world around the other way
Back to where it started yesterday
Just take my hand together we can
Turn the world around the other way
Yes we'll turn the world around the other way
Back it up and stop on yesterday
Just take my hand together we can
Turn the world around the other way <start> She's burnin' the honky tonks down
Burnin' the honky tonks down
Smoke's been rising all over town
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She caught me runnin' around
She was dancin' in the ashes
When they caught her with them matches
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
Well she's burnin' the honky tonks down
I tried but I could not put them out
Did the best to save the whiskey
But the flame's just too risky
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She couldn't stop that honky tonk sound
It was sizzlin' like a griddle
When I ran out with my fiddle
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She's down in the jailhouse now
Said she felt no remorse
For breakin' out that torch
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
Burnin' the honky tonks down
Smoke's been a rising all over town
She's burnin' the honky tonks down <start> IAM RED AND WHITE AND BLUE

But I can't ever seem to count that far
I love you in a million ways and for a million reasons

You are what makes me happy you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine you are my ev'ning star

Following a distance star to where He lay
Not being sure of what it mean but
Knowing it was their way
And the creatures gathered 'round
And didn't make a sound
And the angels cried
The angels knew what was to come
The reason God had sent His son
From up above
It filled their hearts with joy to see and
Knowing of His destiny
Came tears of love
I've often thought about that night
And wondered if they realized
That star so bright
Was sent to tell all the land
The Son of God would soon become
The Son of Man
And the creatures gathered 'round
And didn't make a sound
And the angels cried
And the angels cried
And the angels cried <start> When we're all alone dear and I'm in your arms are you teasing me
When you're telling me how you thrill to my charms are you teasing me
Are you untrue when I'm not with you when we're apart are you free
Tell me darling while our love is still young are you teasing me
 steel 
You tell me my love could make your life complete are you teasing me
And near from my arms would you long to be free are you teasing me
Are you untrue when I'm not with you when we're apart are you free
Oh tell me darling while our love is still young are you teasing me <start> Thought I'd go crazy when you said goodbye
I didn't have that far to go
But I made a wrong turn somewhere in the night
Down a long and lonely road
Chorus
To Honkytonkville an ideal
Home away from home sweet home
Honkytonkville where I don't feel
A thing since you've been gone
Where the future's always bright
In the glow of neon lights
Livin' high on Barstool Hill in Honkytonkville
There's friendly faces everywhere I turn
Droppin' quarters in the slot
Lord knows that we've all got memories to burn
And that's why that jukebox plays around the clock
Chorus <start> EightyNine Cents in the ash tray
Half empty bottle of Gatorade rolling in the floorboard
That dirty Braves cap on the dash
Dog tags hangin' from the rear view
Old Skoal can and cowboy boots and a Go Army Shirt folded in the back
This thing burns gas like crazy but that's alright
People got their ways of coping
Oh and I've got mine
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field I tear it up
Til all the pain's a cloud of dust
Yeah sometimes I drive your truck
I leave that radio playing
That same ole country station where ya left it
Yeah man I crank it up
And you'd probably punch my arm right now
If you saw this tear rollin' down on my face
Hey man I'm tryin' to be tough
And momma asked me this morning
If I'd been by your grave
But that flag and stone ain't where I feel you anyway
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field I tear it up
Til all the pain's a cloud of dust
Yeah sometimes I drive your truck
I've cussed I've prayed I've said goodbye
Shook my fist and asked God why
These days when I'm missing you this much
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field I tear it up
Til all the pain's a cloud of dust
Yeah sometimes brother sometimes
I drive your truck
I drive your truck
I hope you don't mind I hope you don't mind
I drive your truck <start> Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy I Bow Down

Lost the only thing that he ever loved
Wishing you would come over
Give anything just to hold ya

Doesn't sleep at night unless he's dreaming about you laying right here beside him
Praying someday you might feel like forgiving
And think about giving him one more try

Yeah I know a guy
Who feels like a fool
He's been hating himself for what he put you through
He'd take it all back if he only knew how
He knows that you've probably moved on by now

Lost the only thing that he ever loved
Wishing you would come over

I know a guy <start> He was born in the Bitterroot Valley in the early morning rain
Wild geese over the water heading north and home again
Bringing a warm wind from the south
Bringing the first taste of the spring
His mother took him to her breast and softly she did sing
Oh Montana give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
His mother died that summer and he never learned to cry
He never knew his father and he never did ask why
He never knew the answers that would make an easy way
But he learned to know the wilderness and to be a man that way
His mother's brother took him in to family and his home
Gave him a hand that he could lean on and a strength to call his own
And he learned to be a farmer and he learned to love the land
And he learned to read the seasons and he learned to make a stand
Oh Montana give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
On the eve of his st birthday he set out on his own
He was  years and running when he found his way back home
Riding a storm across the mountains and an aching in his heart
Said he came to turn the pages and to make a brand new start
Now he never told a story of the time that he was gone
Some say he was a lawyer some say he was a John
There was something in the city that he said he couldn't breathe
And there was something in the country that he said he couldn't leave
Oh Montana give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
Now some say he was crazy and they're glad that he is gone
But some of us miss him and we'll try to carry on
Giving a voice to the forest giving a voice to the dawn
Giving a voice to the wilderness and the land that he lived on
Oh Montana give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
Oh Montana give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies <start> Hear the evening breezes start to blowing
See the evening shadows start to come
Listen to the nightbirds start their singing
Now the sounds of night have just begun
A lonely hootowl cries out in the darkness
For its mate that's nowhere to be found
Then a lonesome whippoorwill strats calling
Their lonely voices fill the night with sound
Hear the church bell ringing in the distance
What a mournful sound so late at night
Wonder why the darkness makes it sound so lonesome
Listen to the lonely sounds of night
 steel 
The darkness seems to whisper in the silence
Your love is gone but things will be all right
Still my lonely heart cries through the darkness
Listening to the lonely sounds of night
Hear the church bell ringing in the distance... <start> I am a monkey in a cage
I am a prisoner of your love
I was a solitary man
Until the day you opened up
Like a rose
And I fell inside
And your heart it froze
And I'm trapped under the Ice
You welcomed me with open arms
I drank so freely from your cup
I slept so sound on a bed of nails
Until my eyes they opened up
Like a rose
And it was too late to cry
And your heart it froze
Now I'm trapped under the ice
Trapped under the ice
I am a monkey in a cage
I am a prisoner of your love
I was a solitary man
Until my eyes they opened up
Like a rose
It was too late to cry
And your heart you know it froze
And I'm trapped under the ice
Trapped under the ice <start> Today I started loving you again I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again
What a fool I was to think I could get by with only these few million tears I've cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come
And that crying time for me had just begun
Cause today I started loving you again...
Yes today I started loving you again <start> Wandering mind wandering mind
Wondering where you are and how you spend your time
Wondering if you're wondering bout the one you left behind
My heart is weak but my mind's a little bit stronger
I keep a tellin' myself everyday in my life
But the strain of losin' you has overloaded my mind
Leavin' thoughts of you workin' over time
Wandering mind...
My mind weaks up each day a little bit sooner
To start each day a wandering right on time
But each day ends with my questions still unanswered
Of why you left me here with a wandering mind
Wandering mind...
Wandering mind... <start> Remember the nights we would jam in the motels
After the honky tonks closed
No one had credit
And no one had no place to go.
Just crazy kids with 'lectric machines
And some soul
Turnin' them crowds on
By playin' some loud rock'n roll.
Then came the man with a suit and a tie
And the promise of contracts and bread
With all our joy he gave us to fame and fortune
That left us half dead.
Goin' up's easy
When you got the song
That comes from the depth of the soul
Where it really belongs.
Comin' down's hard when you find
That you just can't sing it no more
Your emerald ring with the solid gold band
Reflects back the face of a whore.
Freddie would play on his guitar all day
And sometimes his firgers would bleed
Sam would ride on his drum
Like a magnificent steed.
Ben on the bass would make the thunder
And the lighting with love
And I'd sing the lyric of life
That I felt the part of.
Then came the money and Freddie dropped out
To start him a band of his own
Sam bought a frenchise and Bennie OD'd
And I'm soon the label alone.
Goin' up's easy
When you got the song
That comes from the depth of the soul
Where it really belongs.
Goin' up's easy
When you got the song
That comes from the depth of the soul
Where it really belongs... <start> You and me together could have run this town
Together you and I could have owned this place
If I'd a sped up and you'd a slowed down
You and me together could have run this town
You blink for a second and a lot of things disappear
I guess I'll add it to the list of the other things lost last year
Yeah you blink for a second things up and just disappear
And it's a pretty long list but I'm still standing here
You and me together could have run this town
Together you and I could have owned this place
If I'd a sped up and you'd a slowed down
You and me together could have run this town
The novel that I'm reading has a character a lot like you
And it took a little while but I recognized things you do
Yeah the novel that I'm reading has a character a lot like yours
I put it back on the shelf took a drink and closed the drawer
You and me together could have run this town
Together you and I could have owned this place

When she asked him for the keys
Said I'm going to the market
Is there anything you need
The first quarter was underway
He never missed a play
She pulled out of the driveway
Took a left at the light
Didn't stop at the market
She just drove right on by
Across the railroad tracks
She never once looked back
She went out for cigarettes
And just kept driving on
He didn't even know it yet
Bur she's gone
As far away as she can get
Passed the point of no regret
She went out for cigarettes
And just kept driving on
Half time is over
The sun is sinking low
It's almost time for supper
But there is nothing on the stove
He looks up from his easy chair
He just noticed she's not there
She made a stop at the bank
Took out some cash
Now she's racing down the highway
On a full tank of gas
As fast as she can go
To where she does not know
She went out for cigarettes
And just kept driving on
He didn't even know it yet
Bur she's gone
As far away as she can get
Passed the point of no regret
She went out for cigarettes
And just kept driving on
She went out for cigarettes
And drove on <start> I cant believe how much I cant help
Believe what you just said
One little whispers making such
Crazy thoughts run through my head
Ive heard it from somebody else
And Ive said once or twice myself
But it never sounded true love was just a word
Up until I heard it coming from you
Something about the way youre
Speaking to me speaks to my soul
I wouldnt want to fight
This powerful feeling taking hold
Ive been told a thousand times
That Id just know it when its right
Well I have to say I do love was just a word
Up until I heard it coming from you
Ive heard it from somebody else
And Ive said once or twice myself
But it never sounded true love was just a word
Up until I heard it coming from you
Oh love was just a word
Up until I heard it coming from you <start> Appreciate ye callin' me Charlie invitin' me to go out tonight with you and the boys
Drink one for me won't ye Charlie flirt with all the girls and make lotsa noise
Live it up like we used to do we sure had fun together in the good ol' days
But I'm happilly married and plan on staying that way
I'm happilly married Charlie you remember the good lookin' girl from Lewieville
We've got a place in the country green grass fresh clean air and the rolling hills
I don't go out much anymore only place is back and forth to work every day
I'm happilly married and plan on staying that way
I'm happilly married and plan on staying that way
I found what I want and I ain't gonna let it get away
I appreciate you invitin' me to come out and play
But I'm happilly married and plan on staying that way

Drop around some time Charlie you know how much we both like to see you again
Give my best to all of the guys and tell 'em I'll be there tonight in spirit with them
They might laugh and call me square
But ain't a one of them that wouldn't trade places with me
Cause I'm happilly married and plan on staying that way
I'm happilly married...
I'm happilly married and plan on staying that way <start> Well I sit here all alone
No one's gonna do me wrong tonight
It seems I've been through it all
And there's no one I could call to get it right
And everywhere I go
Everyone seems so settled in
And sure of where they're going
Well I don't know what I need
Since I've been freed
I'm a horse without a rider
And there's no one left to take the lead
I've been loving blind
Loving every heart I could call mine
I've been loving blind
So sure there was something I could find
But I just couldn't see
There was nothing there for me
Now there's a smile on my face
No there's no trace of the pain
I know I've been through it all
And I know those tears won't fall again
But oh the times I thought
Someone's heart I'd caught
Well I was fooled oh and I regret
I was so naive
Oh and I'd believe them when they'd tell me
That's as good as love can get
And I've been loving blind
Loving every heart I could call mine
And I've been loving blind
So sure there was something I could find
But I just couldn't see
There was nothin' there for me <start> CONVOY

That I've never been
A dog among dogs
A man among men
And every day
When I come home to her
She holds a phantom
She kisses and she hugs him
And I am not
Averse to how she loves him
Why must I live and walk
Unloved as what I am
Why can't I be loved as what I am
A wolf among wolves and not as a man among men
She craves a home that she can go in
A sheltered cave that I have never seen
Not in my life
And not even in my dreams
Why can't I be loved as what I am
A wolf among wolves and not as a man among men <start> I was born on the Dixie Highway red play and Georgy pines
I was raised on the Dixie Highway no sweeter place you'll ever find
Wood frame house and grandma driveway
Willow trees on our front porch
Just outside the city limits on the highway thirty four
Yeah I was born on the Dixie Highway red play and Georgy pines
I was raised on the Dixie Highway no sweeter place you'll ever find 
And having tobacco rolling on the roadside
Rolled it up and we smoked it down
Don't feel much but it makes you feel big
When you're ten years old in a tiny town
Yeah I was born on the Dixie Highway red play and Georgy pines
I was raised on the Dixie Highway no sweeter place you'll ever find
Have a chicken meal right in the backyard
Close line running east to west
Water bane to make a garden six days and a sun to rest
Yeah I was born  on the Dixie Highway  red play and Georgy pines
I was raised  on the Dixie Highway  no sweeter place you'll ever find
Summertime hot and hazy bare feet and a water hose
Melon and lime on a country table
Lighting the buds when the sun goes down
I was born  on the Dixie Highway  red play and Georgy pines
I was raised  on the Dixie Highway  no sweeter place you'll ever find
And the holy ghost on a Sunday morning
Gospel songs and a Bible read
Sunday lunch at momma's table praying for Lord and break the bread
I was born  on the Dixie Highway red play and Georgy pines
I was raised on the Dixie Highway no sweeter place you'll ever find
I screamed in porch right at the backdoor
Washing machine and an old wood stove
Momma's singing in the kitchen rolling homemade biscuit dough
I was born  on the Dixie Highway  red play and Georgy pines
I was raised  on the Dixie Highway no sweeter place
When I'm old and Heaven's calling
And they come to care me away
Just lay me down down in soft land
Here where me and Jordan play
Yeah I was born on the Dixie Highway red play and Georgy pines
I was raised  on the Dixie Highway no sweeter place you'll ever find
No sweeter place you'll ever find
No sweeter place you'll ever find <start> I saw my life this morning
Lying at the bottom of a drawer
All this stuff I'm saving
God knows what this junk is for
And whatever I believed in
This is all I have to show
What the hell were all reasons
For holding on for such dear life
Here's where I let go
Chorus
I'm not running
I'm not hiding
I'm not reaching
I'm just resting in the arms of the great wide open
Gonna pull my soul in
And I'm almost home
I saw you this morning
You were looking straight at me
From an ancient photograph
Stuck between letters and some keys
I was lost just for a moment
In the ache of old goodbyes
Sometimes all that we can know is
There's no such thing as no regrets
Baby it's all right
Repeat chorus
Instrumental
There's no such thing as no regrets
But baby it's alright
Repeat chorus <start> Who's gonna love you after I've gone away
Who's gonna kiss the lips that I kissed today
Who's gonna hold you when you're old and gray oh don't let true love slip away
For once in a lifetime true love comes along and hold it gently don't let it go wrong
Treat it with kindness or soon it will fade oh don't let true love slip away
For true love is something that money can't buy
So don't take it lightly true love's the stuff of life
You'll travel forever down life's lost highway if you let true love slip away
So don't let true love slip away <start> My latest sun is sinking fast
My race is nearly run
My strongest trials now are past
My triumph has begun
Oh come angel band
Come and around me stand
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings
To my immortal home
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings
To my immortal home
Oh bear my longing heart to him
Who bled and died for me
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin
And gives me victory
Oh come angel band
Come and around me stand
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings
To my immortal home
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings
To my immortal home <start> All you know it all lovers better heed some advice
If you're bad to your baby you'd better think twice.
Love don't come easy love ain't blind.
You've got to show her you love her morning and night
Be there for her just to make things right.
Make her believe till there ain't a doubt in her mind.
Better baby your baby with a love that's strong
Hold her and tell her you'll never do wrong.
Better baby your baby cause if you don't
One day your babyll be gone.
Don't let her get lonely don't make her cry
Don't take her for granted don't tell her a lie.
Bring her red roses when she's blue.
Give her the best of what you've got to give
You'll be together as long as you live
Better baby your baby shell baby you.
Better baby your baby with a love that's strong
Hold her and tell her you'll never do wrong.
Better baby your baby cause if you don't
One day your babyll be gone. <start> When you broke my heart I wanted to
Cut the breakline on your fourwheel drive
And poison your Pabst Blue Ribbon
When you drug my name all through the mud
I was dying to do the same but I held my tongue
'Cause that ain't Christian
And you might be laughing now
But what goes around comes around
So I hope you have a daughter and I hope that she's a fox
Daddy's little girl just as sweet as she is hot
She can't help but love them boys
Who love to love and leave them girls just like her father
Yeah karma's a bitch so I hope you have a daughter
When them boys pick her up wearing cheap cologne
Younger versions of yourself so you'll know when they drive off
What they're thinking
You had some real good lines and they will too
I bet you'll have a cometoJesus when they're being used
On your baby
And you'll want to kick their ass but hey pot that kettle's black
So I hope you have a daughter and I hope that she's a fox
You get a little grayer every time you hear a knock
She can't help but love them boys
Who love to love and leave them girls just like her father
Yeah karma's a bitch so I hope you have a daughter
Yeah it kind of makes me sad
That she'll be the one to get you back
So I hope you have a daughter and I hope that she's a fox
Daddy's little girl just as sweet as she is hot
She can't help but love them boys
Who love to love and leave them girls just like her father
Yeah karma's a bitch so I hope you have a daughter
You sonofabitch I hope you have a daughter <start> Farther along we'll know more about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
Tempted and tried will oft make you wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested though in the wrong
When death has found and taken our loved ones
Leaving our home so lonely and dreary
Then do we wonder why others prosper
Living so wicked year after year <start> It wears on my patience when I talk to those deejays
At the corporation station they slather on false praise
Even though I'm slow I know no radio will give my record spins
Lean on me all you want to I'll break before I bend
Way up in those ivory towers with gold records on the walls
All the big wigs got the power but they ain't got the balls
The desk bound clowns that run this town
Have watered down the sound just like their gin
Lean on me all you want to I'll break before I bend
Hell yeah I'd love to make it but I suck at playing games
I'd rather starve than fake it for a little taste of fame
It's wrong to be a doggone pawn singing songs that make
You yawn for payments on a long mercedes benz
Lean on me all you want to I'll break before I bend <start> Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again
What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few millions tears I cry
I should have known the worst was yet to come
And that crying time for me had just begun
'Cause today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again
Well today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again
And then today I started loving you again <start> Now I've got a pony the fastest thing around
And of all the girls I've known she's the truest one I've found.
Well she'll cut 'em and she'll head 'em just the way you want 'em
Turned
And if you drop your loop around 'em she can make a grass rope hum
And any time you got a rodeo and I've got the entry fee
You can bet your boots my gal and I will come.
Chorus
Whoopeetididiido on the plains of colorado
That young pony was born to work the trail.
Some old idaho rawhider was the first one tried to ride her
Bronco buster wild horse rustler well she flipped him off like a
Turkey feather duster.
Now some folks like a cadillac with power brakes and air
Just give me a hamlee saddle and my little buckskin mare.
Well I rode her up a mountain when we made that summer drive
And I gtook her to wyomin for a rodeo or two
At old cheyenne and saratoga we roped them little dogies
She the best ole gal this cowboy ever knew.
When she gets to old to rodeo too old to ride the range
I'll take the buckskin lady out across the open plains.
Cause she's just an ole cow pony and I know she'd go plum crazy
If she had to stand unsaddled around the barn the whole day through
I'll just turn her loose to ramble underneath them rocky mountains
And tell 'em that her workin days are through.
Chorus
Whoopeetididiido on the plains of colorado
That's my pony sir and I say she ain't for sale. <start> When I was young my dad would say
Come on son let's go out and play
Sometimes it seems like yesterday
I'd climb upon the closet shelf
When I was all by myself
Grab his hat and fix the brim
Pretending I was him
Chorus
No matter how hard I try
No matter how many tears I cry
No matter how many years go by
I still can't say goodbye
He always took care of mom and me
We cut down a Christmas tree
He always had some time for me
Wind blows through the trees
Streetlights they still shine bright
Moon still looks the same
But I miss my dad tonight
Stopped by a Salvation Army store
Saw a hat like my daddy wore
Tried it on when I walked in
Still trying to be like him
Chorus <start> Good things come to those who wait
And only fools rush in
I've let those words guide my fate
Time and time again
But nothing's etched in stone
And I guess I should have known
That whoever made those rules never looked into your eyes
On a moonlit night
Who would have thought that I could've found a love this strong
Can't be wrong
Less is more made sense before
But now I can't get enough
Baby you made a fool of whoever made those rules
Some say love will lose its shine
Once the new wears off
The heat of passion fades with time
But they couldn't be more wrong
I knew with just one look
That we would rewrite the book
'Cause whoever made those rules never looked into your eyes
On a moonlit night
Who would have thought that I could've found a love this strong
Can't be wrong
Less is more made sense before
But now I can't get enough
Baby you made a fool of whoever made those rules
Baby you made a fool out of whoever made those rules
Baby you made a fool out of whoever made those rules <start> Old brown clock ticking on my shelf
Take my mind to someplace else
Little gold clock ticking by my bed
Funny little people dancing 'round my head
Morning brings me things to do
Morning brings me thoughts of you
Gentle sunshine through the curtain lace
Some of which shining on your sweet face
Counting hours making days
Watching time throwing love away
Nothing golden never stays
That's what I heard the poets say Mmm ...
Time is always taking me
Places I don't want to be
But when the morning rise the moon
I know a bird day's coming soon
Counting hours making days
Watching time throwing love away
Nothing golden never stays
That's what I heard the poets say Mmm ...
Morning brings me things to do
Morning brings me thoughts of you
Gentle sunshine through the curtain lace
Some of which shining on your sweet face <start> Drinkin' dark whiskey
Tellin' white lies
One leads to another
On a Saturday night
Don't ya cross your heart
Unless you hope to die
Drinkin' dark whiskey
Tellin' white lies
Well the first drop burns
But the second one goes down smooth
Then that old black label gets a hold of you
It loosens your tongue but it never tells the truth
Drinkin' dark whiskey
Tellin' white lies
One leads to another
On a Saturday night
Don't ya cross your heart
Unless you hope to die
Drinkin' dark whiskey
Tellin' white lies
When the bottle starts talkin'
Be careful what he might say
He talks in the dark like he never would in the day
Then he gets in trouble just as soon as he gets away
Drinkin' dark whiskey
Tellin' white lies
One leads to another
On a Saturday night
Don't ya cross your heart
Unless you hope to die
Drinkin' dark whiskey
Tellin' white lies
Well a little white lie don't mean anyone no good
When it's making the rounds all over the neighborhood
The next thing you know your all misunderstood
Drinkin' dark whiskey
Tellin' white lies
One leads to another
On a Saturday night
Don't ya cross your heart
Unless you hope to die
Drinkin' dark whiskey
Tellin' white lies <start> I refuse to hear the things they say about you
I won't let my eyes behold the things you do
I don't want to see or hear the things they whisper even if it's true
Even if it's true that you've been seen with someone new
Nothing in this world could turn my love away from you
All the talk could never make me be ashamed of you even if it's true
Even if it's true <start> Panis angelicus
Fit panis hominum
Dat panis coelicus
Figuris terminum
O res mirabilis
Manducat Dominum
Pauper servus et humilis.
Te trina Deitas
Unaque poscimus
Sic nos tu visita
Sicut te colimus
Per tuas semitas
Duc nos quo tendimus
Ad lucem quam inhabitas. <start> Tempted tempted tempted to fall in again
Tempted tempted I'm tempted to fall in love again
Sometimes love can hurt you bad
Make you stop and wonder what you really had
But I guess it's all part of the master plan
To be tempted to fall in love again
Tempted tempted tempted to fall in again
Tempted tempted I'm tempted to fall in love again
When I miss love the most it's late at night
When the party is over and everything gets quiet
Then the memory of love starts burning in my brain
And I'm tempted to fall in love again
Tempted tempted tempted to fall in again
Tempted tempted I'm tempted to fall in love again... <start> Our meeting's a pleasure
And parting is grief
But a false hearted lover
Is worse than a thief
A thief can but rob you
And take what you save
But a false hearted lover
Takes you to your grave
I'm troubled I'm troubled
I'm troubled in mind
If trouble don't kill me
I'll live a long time
A grave will decay you
And turn you to dust
Show me a girl in a million
That a poor boy can trust
They'll hug you and kiss you
And tell you more lies
Than cross ties on the railroad
Or stars in the sky
I'm troubled I'm troubled
I'm troubled in mind
If trouble don't kill me
I'll live a long time
I'm going to Georgia
I'm going to roam
I'm going to Georgia
To make it my home
Gonna build me a cabin
On the mountain so high
Where the wild birds and turtle doves
Can hear my sad cry
I'm troubled I'm troubled
I'm troubled in mind
If trouble don't kill me
I'll live a long time <start> I'll have a blue Christmas without you I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing dear if you're not here with me
I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin'
You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas
 steel 
I'll have a blue Christmas I know dear
I hope your white Christmas brings you cheer
And when you say your prayers on this Christmas Eve
Will you feel the same dear as when you prayed with me
And when those blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue mem'ries start calling
You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas <start> I know what you're thinking when you look at me
The love in your eyes is so easy to see
It's real and it's good what I feel for you
Love is worth living when you love like we do
I understand when you're not feeling well
If there's something on your mind I always can tell
I'm there when you need me and you're there when I need you
Love is worth living when you love like we do
Love is worth living when you love like we do
We found the happiness that very few do
You know that I want you and you know that I want you
Love is worth living when you love like we do
 piano 
Love is worth living...
Love is worth living when you love like we do <start> Hello I'm looking for a friend I lost some time ago
Your mother says she wants her girl back home
Sometimes you think you've found yourself you really only lost yourself
Or maybe you're afraid to be alone
But if I could see behind blue eyes
At all the things that dusty windows tried to hide
Then I could see behind the walls of Caroline
And behind blue eyes
I heard that you're in town again you surely can depend on me
To keep you out of the sun
Down and out and out and then I'm climbing up the walls again
We're standing in line to be the one
But if I could see behind blue eyes
And all the things that dusty windows tried to hide
Then I could see behind the walls of Caroline
And behind blue eyes
I've faced it
I'm wasted
Don't fly away before your time
It's phony
You owe me
Come on don't fly away before your time
Yeah
But if I could see behind blue eyes
At all the things that dusty windows tried to hide
Then I could see behind the walls of Caroline
And behind blue eyes <start> Six o'clock on Friday evening
Momma doesn't know she's leaving
'Til she hears the screen door slamming
Rubber squealin' gears ajamming
Local country station just a blaring on the radio
Pick him up at seven and they're headin' to the rodeo
Momma's on the front porch screamin' out her warning
Girl you better get your red head
Back in bed before the morning
Nine o'clock the show is ending
But the fun is just beginning
She knows he's anticipating
But she's gonna keep him waiting
Grab a bite to eat
And then they're heading to the honkey tonk
But loud crowds and line dancing
Just ain't what they really want
Drive out to the boondocks
And park down by the creek
And where it's George Strait
Real late dancing cheek to cheek
Ain't going down
'Til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in
'Til they get enough
Going 'round the world
In a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down
'Til the sun comes up
Ten 'til twelve is wine and dancing
Midnight starts the hard romancing
One o'clock that truck is rocking
Two is coming still no stopping
Break to check the clock at three
They're right on where they want to be
And four o'clock get up and going
Five o'clock that rooster's crowing
Yeah ain't going down
'Til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in
'Til they get enough
Going 'round the world
In a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down
'Til the sun comes up
Six o'clock on Saturday
Her folks don't know he's on his way
The stalls are clean the horses fed
They say she's grounded 'til she's dead
Well here he comes around the bend
Slowing down she's jumping in
Hey mom your daughter's gone
And there they go again
Ain't going down
'Til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in
'Til they get enough
Going 'round the world
In a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down
'Til the sun comes up <start> Good morning captain good morning son
Do you need another mule skinner
Out on your new road line
Well I like to work
I'm rolling all the time
Lord I like to work boy
I'm rolling all the time
I can pop my initials
Right on a mule's behind
Well it's hey little water boy bring your water 'round
Lord it's hey little water boy bring your water 'round
And if you don't like your job just set that water bucket down
I work out on the new road from a dollar and a dime a day
Lord I work out on the new road I make a dollar and a dime a day
I've got three women on Saturday night
Waiting to draw my pay
Well I'm going to town honey what can I bring you back
Well I'm going to town baby what can I bring you back
Just bring a pint of good rye
And a John B.Stetson hat
Lord it's raining here and it's storming on the deep blue sea
Lord it's raining here and it's storming on the deep blue sea
Can't no blonde headed woman make a monkey out for me
If your house catches fire and there ain't no water 'round
If your house catches fire and there ain't no water 'round
Just throw your good gal out the window let your house just burn on down
Well I'm leaving here and I ain't gonna take no clothes
I'm leaving here and I ain't gonna take no clothes
There may be good times in this old town but it's better on down the road <start> Way down in Columbus Georgia wanna be back in Tennessee
Way down in Columbus Stockade friends have turned their backs on me
Oh go on and leave me if you wish to never let me cross your mind
In your heart you love another leave me little darlin' I don't mind
 guitar 
Last night as I lay sleeping I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I woke I was mistaken I was peeping through the bars
Oh go on and leave me...
Leave me little darlin' I don't mind leave me little darlin' I don't mind <start> Your world was so different from mine don't you see
We couldn't be close though we tried
We both reached for heavens but ours weren't the same
That's what happens when two worlds collide
Your world was made up of things sweet and good
My world could never fit in I wish it could
Two hearts lie in shambles and oh how we've cried
That's what happens when two worlds collide
 steel  piano  ac.guitar 
Now your world was made up... <start> I know what youve been waiting for
A little love and happiness
The truth in front of you so hard to ignore
All you need is tenderness
So drop the Norma Jean
I ain't no James Dean
Just let it flow no need to fake it babe
We can make it babe if we just let it go
It's only natural baby
You and me dancing close
This could be love
You never know
Just take my hand now baby
We can move it out on the floor
This could be the love that you've waited for
Don't sit around and dream
Let's do the natural thing
Youre thinking maybe I'm just breaking the rules
By coming on a little strong
But I got information you can use
Do lighten up and play along
Lets have a wing ding a little spring thing
Dont tell me no
I dont want no wedding ring aint rushing anything
Just let the good times roll
It's only natural baby
You and me dancing close
This could be love
You never know
Just take my hand now baby
We can move it out on the floor
This could be the love that you've waited for
Don't sit around and dream
Let's do the natural thing
So drop the Norma Jean
I ain't no James Dean
Just let it flow no need to fake it babe
We can make it babe if we just let it go
It's only natural baby
You and me dancing close
This could be love
You never know
Just take my hand now baby
We can move it out on the floor
This could be the love that you've waited for
Don't sit around and dream
Let's do the natural thing <start> There's lots of pretty cowgirls but this you may not know
There's a very special kind at every rodeo
Her husband is a cowboy she's his greatest fan
She's the wife behind the cowboy and the cowboys a lucky man
She's hauled water from the crick and got dust all over her clothes
She's been so hot she's thought she'd die and so cold she nearly froze
She's cooked over an open fire slept under the stars above
And you know she'd do it all again just to be with the man she loves
She rides the circuit with her man they go from town to town
She builds up his confidence when the horses buck him down
And she's driven weary miles across an endless land
She's the wife behind the cowboy and the cowboys a lucky man
When he climbs down in the chute and about to start his ride
She cheers more than anyone with a special kind of pride
And when she hears that whistle blow and she sees her cowboy smile
She's glad because he's happy and that makes it all worthwhile <start> papa's in the parlor
with baby on his knee
mama's in the kitchen
with dishes in the sink
the radio's loud
the radio's clear
everything's gone
but we're all still here
market in the morning
stay home at night
keep your head down
keep your mouth shut tight
cause the radio's loud
the radio's clear
everything's gone
but we're all still here
there's no way out
there's no way out
there's no way out
from here
take the last train
from the last train station
meet me at the harbor
where i'll be waitin'
cause the radio's loud
the radio's clear
everything's gone
but we're all still here
there's no way out
there's no way out
there's no way out
from here
and the radio's loud
the radio's clear
someone's screaming
all the world can hear
so blind your eyes
deafen your ears
everything's gone
but we're all still here
there's no way out
there's no way out
there's no way out
from here <start> His name was Twister he lived in the pasture
Right down from my daddy's farm
They say there's a cowboy who once tried to ride him
Now he's mending fences with only one arm
On my way home from school somehow he always knew
Just when I'd come walking by
And he'd stand at the gate like the keeper of fate
And we both knew that one day I'd just have to ride
Now one crack of dawn well I slipped my boots on
And walked out towards that just rising sun
My heart skipped a beat when I heard his four feet
Pounding down on the red dirt like it was a drum
He walked up against me as if to convince me
His heart was easily tamed
Then I came to staring up at the blue and the black
With a handful of mane
Well I thought he'd go one way but he went the other
I'm lucky I even survived
You can't always sit on the fence while the world passes by
Sometimes you just gotta ride
Well the years have gone by since that morning I climbed
On that shadow that cut through the fields
My shoulder still hurts when the weather turns worse
Sometimes you find the strength in the wounds that don't heal
Between horses and heartaches women and mistakes
I've been through more than I should
But I strapped a saddle across every battle
And held on as long as I could
Well I thought he'd go one way but he went the other
I'm lucky I even survived
You can't always sit on the fence while the world passes by
Sometimes you just gotta ride
Well I thought he'd go one way but he went the other
I'm lucky I even survived
You can't always sit on the fence while the world passes by
Sometimes you just gotta ride <start> Go ahead and make me cry
Go ahead and make me blue
Bring the teardrops to my eyes
If that's what you wanna do
Go ahead and make me lonely
Darling I belong to you
For you are my one and only
Go ahead and make me blue
Darling I could never change
So why should I complain
Even though you broke my heart
It's yours to tear apart
Go ahead and make me live
Go ahead and let me die
This is all I have to give
Go ahead and make me cry
Darling I could never change <start> Without you
The days come and go they mean nothing to me
Nothing means nothing without you
My eyes overflow till all I can see
Is a future I can't face without you
Without you without you it's not like before
How can I face life without you
The days are as dark as the nights anymore
And I am so lonely without you without you
Too many things to remind me of you
How could I forget about you
Oh how can I make it now that I've lost you
For I am so lost without you
Without you without you it's not like before... <start> For the life of me
You know I can't recall
My father giving mighty words of wisdom
But the more I live I see
The greatest gift of all
Is how I always knew for sure he was listening
To a million questions I felt like a fool to ask
And when I'd ask him for an answer he'd just laugh
And say the more I learn
The more I learn how little that I know
But I'm close to understanding
Just how far I have to go
We give our hearts
We take our chances
And know the fool ain't the one with all the questions
To tell the truth it's someone who believes they have the answers
In the years since then
When my children come
Pouring out their hearts
This old world has broken
I do the listening
I've seen what good it's done
When less not more is spoken
And when they press me hard to tell them what the answer is
I remember well and simply offer this
And say 'the more I learn
The more I learn how little that I know
But I'm close to understanding
Just how far I have to go
We give our hearts
We take our chances
And know the fool ain't the one with all the questions
To tell the truth it's someone who believes they have the answers <start> We'd get up before sunup to get the work done up
We'd work in the fields till the sun had gone down
We've stood and we've cried as we have bristly watched
A hailstorm a' beatin' our crops to the ground
We've gone to bed hungry many nights in the past
In the good old days when times were bad
No amount of money could buy from me
The memories that I have of then
No amount of money could pay me
To go back and live through it again
I've seen daddy's hands break open and bleed
And I've seen him work till he's stiff as a board
An' I've seen momma layin' in suffer and sickness
In need of a doctor we couldn't afford
Anything at all was more than we had
In the good old days when times were bad
We've got up before and found ice on the floor
Where the wind would blow snow through the cracks in the wall
And I couldn't enjoy then havin' a boyfriend
I had nothing decent to wear at all
So I long for a love that I never had
In the good old days when times were bad
No amount of money could buy from me
The memories that I have of then
No amount of money could pay me
To go back and live through it again
In the good old days when times were bad
In the good old days when times were bad <start> My love swears that he is made of truth
I do believe him though I know he lies
I've caught him creeping 'round darkened holes
I've caught him staring at distant skies
I would have seen it coming but I'm blind with age
Too much time on the battle line
Shut it all out just let the notes fall slow
Slow
My love lives inside a haze of gloom
He fears today what might come tomorrow
Seeks the shadow shuns the light
Bleeds for knowledge prepares for sorrow
I would have seen it coming but I'm blind with age
Too much time on the battle line
Shut it all out just let the note fall slow
Slow
This ain't no depression just notes falling slow
An early snow and notes falling slow
Do I have the strength to bear their passion
An early snow and notes falling slow <start> Well if you ask me where I come from
Here's what I tell everyone
I was born by God's dear grace
In an extraordinary place
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly
It's a big ol' land with countless dreams
Happiness ain't out of reach
Hard work pays off the way it should
Yeah I've seen enough to know that we've got it good
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly
There's a lady that stands in a harbor
For what we believe
And there's a bell that still echoes
The price that it cost to be free
I pledge allegiance to this flag
And if that bothers you well that's too bad
But if you got pride and you're proud you do
Hey we could use some more like me and you
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly
Yes there's a lady that stands in a harbor
For what we believe
And there's a bell that still echoes
The price that it cost to be free
No it ain't the only place on earth
But it's the only place that I prefer
To love my wife and raise my kids
Hey the same way that my daddy did
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly <start> If I was a cloud I'd make baby raindrops
And they'd feed the treetops
If I was a cloud
If I was the sun I'd shine on the flowers
And pass on the power
If I was the sun
If I was the moon I'd caress every ocean
In celestial motion
If I was the moon
If I was a star charmed and enchanted
All wishes would be granted
If I was a star
If I was your man the kisses would linger
I'd melt in your fingers
If I was your man
If I was your man we'd share every shower
And wash away the hours baby
If I was your man
If I was a song I'd reach all the people
From barrooms to steeples
If I was a song
If I was a dream I'd be sweeter than honey
I'd be bigger than money
If I was a dream
If I was your man we'd dance through the daisies
They'd say we were crazy girl
If I was your man
If I was your man I'd pump you with this passion
You'd get more than fashion baby
If IIIII was your man
You would not have to hurry
I'd rub away your worries girl
If I was your man
If I was your man then we'd be together
Now and forever baby
If I was your man
And if we were love we'd heal every nation
We'd be on everybody's station
If we were love
If I was your man sweet lovin' man
If I was your man
If I was your man <start> Here's how it goes
Boy meets girl
Girl leaves boy
That's all I know
All I've done
All my life
'Cause throughout my history
I've only been with jerks
Who couldn't take it
But you see the picket fence
A swing on the front porch
With us two on it
When I believe that nothing lasts forever
You stay with me keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever wanna give you up
Till now I've always been a quitter
You rescued me
Saved my life
Just in time
Saw past all my
Issues and scars
And made me try
'Cause oh the way you're kissing me
Makes it hard to breathe
But I still like it
Oh oh it truly feels like a dream
You know exactly
How I want it
When I believe that nothing lasts forever
You stay with me keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever wanna give you up
Till now I've always been a quitter
I've always been a quitter
When I believe that nothing lasts forever
You stay with me keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever wanna give you up
Till now I've always been a quitter
I've always been a quitter <start> She didn't look so pretty as some other I have known
And she wasn't good at conversation when we were alone
But she had a way of making me believe that I belong
And it felt like coming home when I found her
She seemed to be so proud of me just walking holding hands
And she didn't think that money was the measure of a man
And we seemed to fit together when I held her in my arms
And it left me feeling warm when I loved her
She brightened up the day like the early morning sun
And she made what I was doing seem worthwhile
It's the closest thing to living that I guess I've ever done
And it made me want to smile when I loved her
Some of us were born to cast our fortunes to the wind
And I guess I'm bound to travel down a road that never ends
But I know I'll never look upon the likes of her again
And I'll never understand why I lost her she brightened up the day
Hmm when I loved her hmm when I loved her <start> 
The word If just two tiny letters
Says so much for something so small
The biggest little word in existence
Never answers just questions us all
If regrets were gold I'd be rich as a queen
If teardrops were diamonds how my face would gleam
If I'd loved you better I wouldn't be lonely
If only if only if only
But looking back now I see clearly
With my twentytwenty hindsight
Oh but don't think I haven't paid dearly
'Cause you could be in my arms tonight
If regrets were gold I'd be rich as a queen
If teardrops were diamonds how my face would gleam
How I let you go I swear is beyond me
But if only ah if only oh if only
I could start over if I could go back
Have the power to change things
Then I would do that
But I listened to others like a fool
Oh shame on me
But if only you would just come back
If only dare I even ask
Oh if only <start> 
It was so right
It was so wrong
Almost at the same time
The pain and ache
A heart can take
No one really knows
When the memories cling
And keep you there
'Til you no longer care
And you can let go now
It's wrong for me
To cling to you
Somehow I just needed time
From what was to be
It's not like me
To hold somebody down
But I was tossed high by love
Almost never came down
Only to land here
But love's no longer found
Where I'm no longer bound
And I can let go now
I can let go now <start> Dark cloud hanging overhead
Sky is grey blue and red
I should have run now it's too late
A thunderstorm a hurricane
I ignore all the signs
So it took me by surprise
Now I'm caught out in the rain
A thunderstorm a hurricane
Let it pour over me
Holy water make me clean
Drive and drive and I disappear
Like I was never here
Everything is washed away
A thunderstorm a hurricane <start> Red and yellow black and white they are precious in his sight
Jesus loves the little children of the world.
Everything is beautiful in its' own way
Like a starry summer night or a snow covered winter's day
And everybody's beautiful in their own way
Under God's heaven the world's gonna find a way.
There is none so blind as he who will not see
We must not close our minds we must let our thought be free
For every hour that passes by you know the world gets a little bit older
It's time to realize that beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.
Everything is beautiful in its' own way
Like a starry summer night or a snow covered winter's day
Ah sing it children

Under God's heaven the world's gonna find a way.
We shouldn't care about the length of his hair or the color of his skin
Don't worry about what shows from without but the love that lives within
We're gonna get it all together now and everything gonna work out fine
Just take a little time to look on the good side my friend
And straighten it out in your mind.
Everything is beautiful in its' own way
Like a starry summer night or a snow covered winter's day
Everybody's beautiful in their own way
Under God's heaven the world's gonna find a way.
Everything is beautiful in its' own way
Like a starry summer night or a snow covered winter's day
Everybody's beautiful in their own way
Under God's heaven the world's gonna find a way.
Under God's heaven the world's gonna find a way. <start> HELLO I'M A TRUCK

' Central Songs BMI
Hello I'm a truck
You've heard songs about truck drivers many times their stories told
How they pulled out of Pittsburg for six days on the road
Bout the Feather River Canyon and climbin' the old grapevine
That old roadhouse down in Texas and the girls they've left behind
You've heard their tales of daring and I think that's just fine
But if you can spare a minute well I'd like to tell you mine
There'd be no truck drivers if it wasn't for us trucks
No double clutching gear jaming coffee drinking nuts
They'll drive their way to glory and they have all the luck
There'd be no truck drivers if it wasn't for us trucks
Well there he sits in that cafe drinking coffee and telling lies
Prob'ly telling 'em how to talk that hill ten miles back
How telling 'em how he missed a gear and that Volkswagen full of hippies
Passed us like I was sitting up on jacks or how we took that curve over on 
Han'ta been for me hanging on the shoulder we'd both wound up in the ditch
If we're on time he takes the credit if we're late I get the blame
Up those hills with shutters open my stacks are running flame
My stack a running red light sucking diesel from the tanks
I take him south and bring him back without a word of thanks
So now you've heard my story and I guess it's my tough luck
There'd be no truck drivers if it wadn't for us trucks
There'd be no truck drivers...
Look at him sipping coffee and flirtin' with that waitress
And where do you think he left me that's right next to cattle truck 
Why couldn't we have put me next to that little pink mack sittin' over there
Gosh she's got pretty mud flaps and talk about stracked they're both chromed
Well he'll be coming out in a minute and he'll get that bar
And he'll go around and beat on my tires
You know for two pints of diesel I'd have a flat on the inside dual
Ha that fixed him I never did like the way he drives anyhow
Thainks he's God's gift to waitresses he never gives 'em a tip
Well I know what he's gonna do now he's gonna take out
The tape cartridge of Back Owens and play it again
I don't know why he don't get a Merle Haggard tape <start> I remember how we struggled when we first started out
She recalls we had it all not what we did without
I think back on those hard times she remembers only love
Well who am I to say that's not exactly how it was
That's how she remembers it she was the lucky one
Just take a look at both of us and you tell me who won
If she thinks I hung the stars if that's what she believes
Then who am I to tamper with her perfect memory
You ought to hear her tell the kids how mom and daddy met
It always amazes me the things that she forgets
Somehow she gets it turned around but it's still my favorite part
How mommy looked in daddys eyes and I stole away her heart
That's how she remembers it she was the lucky one
Just take a look at both of us and you tell me who won
If she thinks I hung the stars if that's what she believes
Then who am I to tamper with her perfect memory
If I made her dreams come true as far as she can see
Who am I to tamper with her perfect memory <start> All the noise and the voices are screamin'
What they have to say
And the headlines and sound bytes are givin' me
Demons to hate
And the man on TV
He tells me it's ugly
But if you ask me
It's a beautiful world
It's a beautiful world
There's tears and there's fears and there's losses and crosses to bear
And sometimes the best we can do is just to whisper a prayer
And press on because
There's so much to live for and so much to love
In this beautiful world
Say what you will but I still believe
It's a beautiful world
It's a beautiful world
And I know 
I'm not dreamin'
I just choose  to believe it
So I hate that I sometimes miss what's right in front of my eyes oh
And I know at the end of my road I'll be wantin' more time
Just another sunset
One more kiss from my baby
A smile from a friend
In this beatiful world
It's a beautiful world
Yeah it's a beautiful world
Say what you will but I still believe
It's a beautiful world
Yeah it's a beautiful world
Oh it's a beautiful world <start> A parody of Riding With Private Malone

Riding With Inmate Jerome
Parody of David Ball's Riding With Private Malone
Enjoy
I was just out of the rehab rolling through the neighborhood
When I came across this homeboy
Said he'd fix me up real good
He led me down an alley
And right through a chain link fence
I had a hundred dollars I could spend
It was parked out in the driveway at a house of illrepute
And in the back seat hung a double breasted lime green suit
What that homeboy showed me nearly caused a heart attack
For what he called a hooptie was a sky blue Cadillac
And I felt a little nervous as I drove out of the hood
But I loved that furry steering wheel
And that dashboard made of wood
I opened up the mini bar and in there I found a note
The stationery said County Jail and this is what he wrote
He said my nizzame is inmate Leroy Jerome
And if youse readin this judge says I isn't coming home
Though I am incarcerated I'll make a deal with you
If you can keep my gals in line this car belongs to you
Now ride low
And drive slow
And make her yours own
You'll always be riding with Inmate Jerome
The grill on the radiator was gold and shiny bright
And I'd tell you those old curb feelers were handy late at night
I get the feeling sometimes if I turn real quick I'd see
A goldtoothed cat daddy in the seat right next to me
One night I was hoppin and when I heard the breaking glass
And I can still remember the sounds of bullets whizzin' past
Someone said they saw a man in a fur coat and fur hat
Push me out of the motorcar and take his Caddy back
It was a young man named inmate Leroy Jerome
He's out of the joint the parole board sent him home
Yes he was incarcerated...but he cut a deal or two
Now he's got a brand new pinky ring and new Bruno Malli shoes
Hey I think I caught a whiff of Michael Jordan's splash cologne
I sho nuff of riding with inmate Jerome <start> There's a ship out on the ocean
At the mercy of the sea.
It's been tossed about lost and broken
Wondering aimlessly.
And God somehow you know that ship is me.
Cause there's a lighthouse in the harbor
Shining faithfully.
Pouring it's light out across the water
For this sinking soul to see
That someone out there still believes in me.
Chorus
On a prayer in a song I hear your voice and it keeps me hanging on on.
Raining down against the wind
I'm reaching out till we reach the circle's end when you come back to me again.
There's a moment that we all come to
In our own time and our own space where all that we've done we can undo
If our heart's in the right place

And again I see my yesterdays in front of me.
Unfolding like a mystery
You're changing all that is and use to be

When you come back to me
Again. <start> They packed up all his buckles and shipped his saddle to his dad
And by the way the house looked she must have took it bad
The workers come on Monday to fix the door and patch the wall
They say she just went crazy the night she got the call
He was up in Wyoming and drew a bull no man could ride
He promised her he'd turn own well it turned out that he lied
And the dreams that they'd been living in the California sand
Died right there beside him in Cheyenne
They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne
They never found her body just her diary by the bed
It told about the fight they had and the words that she had said
When he told her he was ridin' she said 'Then I don't give a damn
If you never come back from Cheyenne
They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne
Nobody can explain it some say she's still alive
They'd even claim they've seen her on the shoreline late at night
And if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne <start> Walks in the rain and talks in the dark
Old black and white movies a day at the park
On a blanket on the ground on a Sunday afternoon
Hangin' with friends or off by ourselves
Drivin' around yard sale to yard sale
Droppin' by the county fair winnin' you a bear poppin' balloons
If you're lookin' for someone to do that with here I am
Someone to be the other half of your plans
Don't look any further than in my eyes
If you're lookin' for that man here I am
December nights all cuddled up
Warmed by the fire and sharin' a cup
Of hot cocoa and laughin' at old photos
Spanish guitars sand and the sea
And quiet little table and just you and me
Sippin' margaritas in a little cantina in Old Mexico
If you're lookin' for someone to do that with here I am
Someone to be the other half of your plans
Don't look any further than in my eyes
If you're lookin' for that man here I am
Talkin' 'bout life and talkin' 'bout babies
Talkin' 'bout us still in love when we're eighty
Yeah if you're lookin' for someone to do that with here I am
Someone to be the other half of your plans
Don't look any further than in my eyes
If you're lookin' for that man here I am here I am
Baby here I am <start> I like you better ohh
I like you better ohh
Those hands gets the best of me ohh
I like crawlin' down on me
I wanted to hold you
Forever forever forever
Forever forever forever
And I wait as you hold it
Goddamn gotta roll with it gotta roll with it
And the ride gets ovover
Where are you goin'
Incomprehensible
I can't think no more I can't think
I can't use my brain I can't think no more
I can't think no more I can't think
I can't use my brain
I like you better ahh
I like you better whoa
Those hands gets the best of me
Your leg crawlin' down on me ohh
And I wanted to hold you
Forever forever forever
Forever forever forever
And I wait as you hold it
Goddamn gotta roll with it roll with it
And the ride gets over
But where are you goin'
Incomprehensible
I can't think no more I can't think
I can't use my brain I can't think no more
I can't think no more I can't think
I can't use my brain
I can't think no more I can't think
I can't use my brain
I can't think no more I can't think
I can't use my brain
I like you better ohh
I like you better ohh
I like you better ohh <start> Strange things are happening everyday
I hear the music up above my head
Though the side of my heart has left me again
I hear music up above
Secrets are written in the sky
Looks like I've lost the love I've never found
Though the sound of hope has left me again
I hear music up above
Standing in my broken heart all night long
Darkness held me like a friend when love was lost
Looking for the land that's hidden in the cross
The finders love
I know I loved you too much
Ill go alone to get through
I hear Rosetta singing in the night
Echo's of lighting shine like stars after there gone
And tonight shes my guide as a girl on the moon
With the music up above <start> When years seem like days to me
No time on my hands
I run away to a place in me
To a faraway land
When home seems so far from me
Heaven's lights look dim
It's just as far as my deepest heart
Where my heart's Father lives
His quiet voice speaking in silence everyday
If I will only listen to the words He has to say
I'll walk in His Spirit see Him in my face
I will live 'cause He will live in my place
When life seems so hard to bear
When shadows look real
The circumstance is your Father's care
Go by faith not what you feel
If you have been running too
Stop now in your tracks
Turn again to the one in you
Put your burden on His back
His quiet voice speaking in silence everyday
If I will only listen to the words He has to say
I'll walk in His Spirit see Him in your face
I will live 'cause He will live in my place
When years seem like days to me
No time on my hands
I run away to a place in me
To a faraway land <start> Well they say your kiss is like forbidden fruit
One taste of your sweet strawberry lips
And I'll be hooked on you they
Say one day just like a dog
You'll own me I say lay it on me
I'm six foot four and tough as a man can be
I ain't scared of much I'll buck right up there's a fightin' side of me
They say I'll turn to putty and you'll mold me well lay it on me
You might be more then I can stand after all honey
I'm just one man I might wind up sad beat down and lonely
But
I'm watching the way them jeans low ride your belly button ring and big blue eyes
And I can hardly wait for you to hold me
Come on and lay it on me well
That born to break hearts tattoo don't faze me
So stroll your sweet self over here and
Bring me to my knees and we'll see who comes out on top
Now won't we lay it on me you might be more then I can stand
After all honey I'm just one man I might wind up sad
Beat down and lonely
But I'm watching the way them jeans low ride
Your belly button ring and big blue eys
And I can hardly wait for you to hold me
Come on and lay it on me well lay down
The lawyer lay it all on the line
Girl I don't care as long as you lay your body next to mine
And if your afraid of falling
Darlin' don't be come on and lay it on me
I say lay it on me come on lay it on me <start> Well I guess I'm through stewing
How 'bout lets roll the rock away
My bedclothes have gone all funky
I've got to get out of this cave
Stay inside
Well the times they are achangin'
Look at all the idlers
Soon there will be no one to shear the sheep
And I am cold natured
Stay inside
Suddenly everything's different and
Everyone's on edge
I just wanted to bring folks together
But it seems that I am the biggest wedge
Stay inside <start> What is so rare as a day in June
'Till now we have never been told
The old question's answered by one that is new
What is so rare dear as you
So rare you're like the fragrance of blossoms fair
Sweet as a breath of air
Fresh with the morning dew
So rare You're like the sparkle of old champagne
Orchids in cellophane
Couldn't compare to you
You are perfection you're my idea
Of angels singing the Ave Maria
For you're an angel I breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you
So rare This is a heaven on earth we share
Caring the way we care
Ours is a love so rare
So rare You have the warmth of a Schubert air
Charming and debonaire
Those are the words for you
So rare You have a way that's beyond compare
That one in a million air
In everything you do
You have that something that certain manner
You thrill me more than the Star Spangled Banner
You stage a love scene so sweetly tender
And in that love scene I gladly surrender
So rare to have a future like yours to share
Sweetheart the way we care <start> I was scared but I couldn't admit it
Hatred planted out of fear
Fight or flight no choice but to hit it
The road it calls on me my dear
I was lost as lost can be
Being praised for being found
But all that praise got lost on me
as the mood swing was headed down
Part from me
I would not dare take someone in love with me where I'm going
Apart you'll see how true it is and how back then
it possibly was impossible for you or me to know it
Your touch was nothing more than a child's goodbye and hello
But it always left me feeling worse when it was time to go
Part from me
I would not dare take someone in love with me where I'm going
Apart you'll see how true it is and how back then
it possibly was impossible for you or me to know it
And most of us out there got fooled as the gold it glittered in the night
And we chased it fast like drunk buffoons
The banker lived the artist died
And all our clothes were washed in grey
All our buildings and our cars
And the florescent lights of day bleached the sky and took the stars
Part from me
I would not dare take someone in love with me where I'm going
Apart you'll see how true it is and how back then
it possibly was impossible for you or me to know it <start> What am I bid for these two eyes that gazed upon her
As a queen reighning on the throne
Once they were happy eyes now they're sad eyes goin' once goin' twice almost gone
What am I bid for these two lips that kissed her lips
The sweetest kiss these lips have ever known
It's been quite a while since they wore a smile goin' once goin' twice almost gone
What am I bid for these two arms that once held her
And knew the thrill of her charms for so long
Please make me some kind of an offer before all of the value is gone
What will you give for what you see before you this empty shell's standing alone
Here's the last chance before the bidding is over goin' once goin' twice goin' gone <start> I lit my love and watched it burn
Asking nothing in return
Except the lessons I will learn
From holding crazy faith
I've been touched by that bright fire
Down to the root of my desire
While the smoke it rises higher
Glowing crazy faith
You're not asking if I love this man
I know you don't you don't believe you can
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancer's fan
It's crazy I know but my faith says so
It tells me
Am I a fool for hanging long
Would I be a fool for being long gone
When is daylight gonna dawn
On my crazy faith
The questions will not let me sleep
The dance is buried way too deep
But the bottom lover lover's keep
Made by crazy faith
You're not asking if I love this man
I know you don't you don't believe you can
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancer's fan
It's crazy I know but my faith says so
It tells me
Love you're losing those you love
Let the hope fly from the glove
Do not search the skies above
Search your crazy faith
Love is lightning love is ice
It only strikes the lucky twice
Once or you will know the price
And once for crazy faith
You're not asking if I love this man
I know you don't you don't believe you can
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancer's fan
It's crazy I know but my faith says so <start> My soul is lost so lonely and so cold
Just like a lamb that has strayed from the fold
Across the barren waste of sin I roam
Oh gentle shepherd hear my cry and lead me home
Oh gentle shepherd hear my lonely cry
And in Thy cool green pastures let me lie
Beside the still clear waters lead Thou me
Oh gentle shepherd safe forever more with Thee

You claim the soul that's strayed from the fold
Oh gentle shepherd hear my cry and save my soul
 <start> Oh does a guilty conscience make you rule the day
You let another take you from my side
Why'd you wed your new love are you lying me
Or does a guilty conscience hurt your pride
Does he take you to the same old places
Does he kiss you like I used to do
When you see the old familiar faces
Does a guilty conscience bother you
Have you kept my letters and my photograph
Have they faded like this love we knew
When you read them over does your heart regret
And does a guilty conscience make you blue
When the day is done and night is falling
And you see that big moon in the sky
When you lay your head upon your pillow
Does a guilty conscience make you cry <start> 
You lied to me
I can't believe
That I've been such a fool
I thought this time
I might find
Someone who would play by the rules
My mind said no
But my heart said go
And again I've made the wrong turn
Now here I stand
My heart in your hands...
And I've gone from burning to burned
Ah you'd think by now
I'd know how
To keep this heart of mine safe
It goes to show
You just never know
Who can you trust these days
How could I make
The same mistake
But as far as I'm concerned
Got myself to blame
Got to close to the flame
Now I've gone from burning to burned
Everyone knows
The old saying goes
That a fool in love
Never learns
But I guess I forgot
'Cause the fire was too hot...
Now I've gone from burning to burned
Oh I guess I forgot
'Cause the fire was too hot...
Now I've gone from burning to burned <start> I was sitting on my doorstep
I hung up the phone and it fell out of my hand
But I knew I had to do it
And he wouldn't understand
So hard to see myself without him
I felt a piece of my heart break
But when you're standing at a crossroad
There's a choice you gotta make
I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like fallin' when I'm try to fly
It's sad but sometimes
Moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye
I know there's a blue horizon
Somewhere up ahead just waiting for me
Getting there means leaving things behind
Sometimes life's so bitter sweet
I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like fallin' when I'm try to fly
It's sad but sometimes
Moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye
Time heals the wounds that you feel
Somehow right now
I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like fallin' when I'm try to fly
It's sad but sometimes
Moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side
Start with goodbye
Like fallin' when you try to fly
It's sad but sometimes
Moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye <start> NICKELS QUARTERS AND DIMES

' Moss Rose Publications
RECORDED BY JIMMY GATELEY
I just took my last ten dollars from my pocket
I said I'd like some change if you don't mind
The bartender asked me how I'd like it
I said nickels quarters and dimes
I spread my silver out across the table
I said money get her off my mind
I thumbed the cash in all of my old mem'ries
With these nickels quarters and dimes
Nickels tip the waitress dimes play the jukebox
And quarters buy me wine wine wine
Now there's seven empty bottles on the table
Money's runnin' short and so is time
Turn the jukebox up and I'll drink faster
Hurry nickels quarters and dimes
I just noticed the waitress has the same first name as you do
And on the jukebox why I'd recognize you're singin' anytime
But I didn't know till now they put your picture
On nickels quarters and dimes
Nickels tip the waitress dimes play the jukebox
And quarters buy me wine wine wine
And quarters buy me wine wine wine <start> All the rain drops in the sky tonight
Can't compare with all pain
And all the tears I've cried
But now I'm done
All the make believe
Locked in this picture frame
Is gonna stay behind
Along with all the burnin rage
That's been tearin' through my heart
It killin' me slowly
Every beat I was fallin' apart
Sometimes you give
Sometimes they take
Sometimes you bend
And sometimes they break you down
Sometimes you stick around
Tryin' to change them make them
Someone that they'll never be
And sometimes you leave
All this time I've spent
Starin' at the door
I never had the strength
To pack my bags and leave before
But now I'm done
Lyin' to myself when it's clear
That you're not the one
Sometimes you give
Sometimes they take
Sometimes you bend
And sometimes they break you down
Sometimes you stick around
Tryin' to change them make them
Someone that they'll never be
And sometimes you leave
When there's nothing left
For me to leave behind
And you're already too far gone
To say goodbye
Sometimes you give
Sometimes they take
Sometimes you bend
And sometimes they break you down
Sometimes you stick around
Tryin' to change them make them
Someone that they'll never be
And sometimes you leave
Sometimes you leave <start> I've been up all night long
Just waitin' on the sun
I've given up damn the dawn
It ain't never gonna come
Something's wrong as long as you're gone
I'm not gonna sleep til I touch your face
Baby not a wink I could go for days
If you ever needed to see me down on my knees
Take a look at me baby I can't sleep
Remember when you said you wouldn't last
I couldn't swallow my pride
Whoa it's sinkin' in baby losin' you has
Finally opened my eyes
I'm wide awake as long as it takes
I'm not gonna sleep til I touch your face
Baby not a wink I could go for days
If you ever needed to see me down on my knees
Take a look at me baby I can't sleep <start> Your world was so different from mine don't you see
We couldn't be close though we tried
We both reached for heavens but ours weren't the same
That's what happens when two worlds collide
Your world was made up of things sweet and good
My world could never fit in I wish it could
Two hearts lie in shambles and oh how they've cried
That's what happenes when two worlds collide
 piano 
Your world was made up... <start> Crash on the levee mama water's gonna overflow
Swamp's gonna rise ain't no boat's a gonna row
Now you can train on down to Williams Point
You can bust your feet and you can rock this joint
But oh mama ain't you gonna miss your best friend now
You're gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow
Now don't you try and move me you're just gonna lose
There's a crash on the levee and mama you've been refused
Well it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt
If you go down in the flood it's gonna be your fault
But oh mama
Well that high tide's risin' mama don't you let me down
Pack up your suitcase mama don't you make a sound
Now it's King for King it's Queen for Queen
It's a gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen
But oh mama
You're gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow <start> Did you hear about Stacy Brown 
He had every chick in town 
He got looks he got class do anything to get a little lass
Everybody shouts at him as he walks his girlies past
They say everybody got one  everybody got one 
Everybody got one  Stacy Brown got two
Do you know the reason for his success 
They say that he was double blessed 
They say that Stacy Brown was born just a little bit deformed
That's why his girl friends they all wake up smilin' every morn
Singin' everybody got one ...
Why they're climbin' up the wall 
Young ones run and the old ones crawl 
He got two and that's a fact but no one knows where the other one's at
On his elbow on his knee or underneath his hat
Ooh everybody got one ...
He got two yes it's true oh neighbors talkin' my girl friend she's jealous <start> Seven years old on a gold palomino I sat up tall with my face to the wind
I'd seen the rodeo cowboys in Reno so I dug in my boot heels and pulled on the reins
And Blaze he took off a running he threw me down off the side
Then my Uncle Jim picked me up once again said get back on that pony and ride
Get back on that pony and ride
So lift up your head boy I know how you're feeling
You say you won't ride with a chance you might lose
You fallen from love and your head is still reeling
Your heart and your pride have been shaken and bruised
And like Blaze she took off a running...
I'm not saying forget what you lost I suppose there's a purpose in pain
What we make of ourselves has a cost
And it's paid every time we take hold of the reins
So dust off your blue jeans get back in the saddle losing's a place to start over again
Gettin' back up there is half of the battle
And love like a pony should race with the wind
And like Blaze it takes off a running... <start> Standin' on the corner with the low down blues
Is a great big hole in the bottom of my shoes
Honey let me be your Salty Dog
Let me be your Salty Dog
Or I won't be your man at all
Honey let me be your Salty Dog
Looking here Sal I know you
Run down stockin' and a worn out shoe
Honey let me be your Salty Dog
Let me be your Salty Dog
Or I won't be your man at all
Honey let me be your Salty Dog
Down in the wildwood sitting on a log
Finger on the trigger and eye on the hog
Honey let me be your Salty Dog
Let me be your Salty Dog
Or I won't be your man at all
Honey let me be your Salty Dog
Pulled the trigger and the gun said go
The shot fell over in Mexico
Honey let me be you Salty Dog
Let me be your Salty Dog
Or I won't be your man at all
Honey let me be your Salty Dog
Let me be your Salty Dog
Or I won't be your man at all
Honey let me be your Salty Dog <start> Two happy people on a Greyhound bus
We came here looking for a life for us
But the nightlife is her new life and the only thing I've found
Is San Francisco is a lonely town
Oh there were good times for a little while
But now her new friends say I cramp her style
I guess I'm only in the way now she don't need me hanging round
Oh San Francisco is a lonely town
Now she's out there somewhere cross San Francisco Bay
She'll be wondering where I am when she gets in today
She'll find I left her a oneway ticket home
And while she stands there cryin' all alone
And while this Greyhound keeps on rolling I'll pray Lord she's found
San Francisco is a lonely town <start> I don't hurt anymore all my teardrops are dried
No more walking the floor with that burning inside
Just to think it could be time has opened the door
And at last I am free I don't hurt anymore
No use to deny I wanted to die the day you said we were through
But now that I find you're out of my mind I can't believe that it's true
I've forgotten somehow that I cared so before
And it's so wonderful now I don't hurt anymore
No use to deny <start> Portland main is just the same as sunny Tennessee
Portland main is just the same as sunny Tennessee
Any old place I hang my hat is home sweet home to me
Went down to the depot and I looked up on the board
I went down to the depot and I looked up on the board
It read it's good times here but better on down the road
Eat my breakfast here get my dinner in New Orleans
Eat my breakfast here get my dinner in New Orleans
I'm going to get me a momma Lord I ain't never seen
Where was you momma when the train left the shed
Where was you momma when the train left the shed
Standin' in my front door wishin' to God I was dead <start> I called you on the phone to say I love you that I'd stop by for you at nine
And my heart broke when you said it's all over
That someone else would take up all your time
And that's a lot of heartaches for a dime
I'll never know what made you change your mind
I only know I've held you close and kissed you my last time
And that's a lot of heartaches for a dime
I went downtown to join the marry makers and told myself that here's where I belong
I thought that I could get along without you until I heard somebody play our song
And that's a lot of heartaches <start> Well I have got stars in my eyes and wings on my feet
And find in my heart the sleepering and kind
And I've got dreams about you I dream will come true
A runnin' through me as how you do me I've got love on my mind.
Oh well I have got smiles on my face and songs on my lips
And poems that I write the real mushy kind
And I've got dose that thrills and cold little chills
A runnin' through me as how you do me I've got love on my mind.
Love on my mind and I'm wantin' you
To you if you would mind I'm tellin' so.
Well I have got stars in my eyes and wings on my feet
And the love in my heart the old fashioned kind
And I've got plans about you if you've got some too
We'll tell 'em through me I think it do me I've got love on my mind.
I love you truly. truly I do I've got love on my mind <start> This big old car gonna take us home
This big old car gonna take us home
Gonna take us home to what we know so well
This big old car gonna take us home
Gonna take us all the way to Brisbane
All the way to Cairns
Back across to Katherine
To the Fitzroy River sands
Gonna see the Indian Ocean
And we'll turn around and then
This big old car's gonna take us home again
Ain't got no rattle free transmission
Ain't no good around the town
There's no fitted air conditioning
We just roll the windows down
And throw another tape in
And turn it up and pray
This big old car gonna take us all the way
This big old car gonna take us home
This big old car gonna take us home
Gonna take us home to what we know so well
This big old car gonna take us home
This big old car gonna take us home
Gonna take us all the way and back
However far we roam
Take us all the way to
Chroma plated big V'd heaven
This big old car's gonna take us home again <start> There's no reason
to be spending all my money on you
when you don't even want to talk
I just don't get it
I just don't get it
I want to be around you know
But you're making it too hard
I get no time with you honey
You're always busy
I give all of mine to you honey
but you're always busy
I come home from work
and you haven't gotten out of bed yet
You just don't get it
You just don't get it
I want to be around you know
But you're making it too hard
I get no time with you honey
You're always busy
I give all of mine to you honey
but you're always busy
I want to be around you know
But you're making it too hard
I get no time with you honey
You're always busy
I give all of mine to you honey
but you're watching TV
I give all my time to you honey
All my time
I give all of mine to you honey
But you got no time for me <start> Heard somebody speak her name
They said she was still looking fine
I could feel that same old flame
I once felt when she was mine
Always thought that I was missing something
But I found out much too late
There'll never be another who loved me that way
Chorus
I'd like to have that one back
I've never known someone so true
And a love that's pure and sweet
Is what a man should never lose
And if my lips had said I'm sorry
She might have stopped right in her tracks
Now I find my poor heart saying
I'd like to have that one back
I can almost see her standing there
Tears rolling down her face
As she packed away her memories
In that old worn out suit case
If I'd only known then what I know now
I'd never open that door
Oh they just don't make hearts like her's any more
Chorus <start> There's a place you can go when you're lonely
And the world turns its back on you
So if you've got a heart at last on apart
Someone's there to tell your troubles to
To a man on the street it's a barroom to a wife
A place where cheaters go
To a girl with green eyes it's a place to hear sweet lies
And the only home a fool would even know
It's a loser's cathedral a chapel for tears
A loser's cathedral and you're always welcome there
Many times I've heard temptation calling
With a voice that whispers soft and low
But I never get that fool and I owe it all to you
Thanks to your sweet love I'll never go
To a loser's cathedral a chapel for tears <start> IT'S JUST MY LUCK
IT'S JUST MY LUCK to live when I'd much rather die.
I'd end my life but I don't have the nerve to try.
You're not worth the salt in each new tear I cry.
And IT'S JUST MY LUCK to love someone like you.
IT'S JUST MY LUCK to find I gave my heart away
To a man who has no heart and treats me any old way.
My first bad luck was when I was born one day.
And IT'S JUST MY LUCK to love someone like you.
Time after time this heart of mine you went and broke.
Till love to me has come to be just a standing joke.
You're not worth the salt in each new tear I cry.
And IT'S JUST MY LUCK to love someone like you
Till I die. <start> I'm alone in a house made of sorrow
And each room is haunted with you
Should the end of the world come tomorrow
I'll be waiting on Heartbreak Avenue
I scattered all our promises behind me
There's no use to hope that they'll come true
But if you change your mind you can find me
I'll be waiting on Heartbreak Avenue
I was warned that some day you'd desert me
I'd wake up and find that we were through
They all told me that you'd only hurt me
And I'd end up on Heartbreak Avenue
Someday you may understand this yearning
When somebody does the same to you
Then when deep in your heart there's a burning
We'll be neighbors on Heartbreak Avenue <start> I thought I saw a man brought to life
He was warm he came around and he was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry
Well you couldn't be that man I adored
You don't seem to know
Seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know him anymore
There's nothing where he used to lie
The conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late I'm already torn
So I guess the fortune teller's right
Should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
It crawled beneath my veins
And now I don't care I had no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can touch I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late I'm already torn torn
There's nothing where he used to lie
My inspiration has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's right
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on this floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I'm ashamed
Bound and broken on the floor
You're a little late I'm already torn torn <start> I'll sail my ship alone with all the dreams I own drifting out across the ocean blue
I'll sail my ship alone though all the sails you've torn
And when it starts to sink then I'll blame you
Well we've been sweethearts for so long now you say we're through
The love we shared is just a memory
I had built a ship of dreams and planned them all for you
And now I guess what is to be will be
I gave a message to the wind to take back on to you hoping you would hear my SOS
Well maybe you would come back home my darling if you knew
How much my aching heart is in distress
Oh I'll sail my ship alone...
Yeah when it starts to sink then I'll blame you <start> Well I grew up wild and free walking these fields in my bare feet
There wasn't no place I couldn't go with a twentytwo rifle and a fishing pole
Well I live in the city but don't fit in you know it's a pity the shape I'm in
But I got no home and I got no choice oh Lord have mercy on a country boy
When I was young I remember well I'd hunt the wild turkey and the bobwhite quail
The river was clear and deep back then and fishin' lines tied to the willow limb
Well I live in the city...
Well they dammed the river they dammed the stream
They cut down the cypress and the sweet gum trees
There's a laundra mat and a barber shop and now the whole meadow is a parking lot
Well I live in the city... <start> G D C
You're the devil's daughter in disguise

So don't try to hide the fire in your eyes
D C G
You must be stupid cause you just don't have a clue
D C D
Even hell frozen over is warmer than my love for you
Chorus
G D C
When all those Aggies move to Austin

And Beaumont is covered in snow

When the wind don't blow in Amarillo
C D G
Darlin' then you can come back home

You sure can shake your little round behind

But your hour glass figure won't buy my time

You know how to work it Lord knows it's worked before

This time you leave your butt will have the imprint of the front door

When Fort Worth is east of Dallas

When all those Aggies move to Austin

And Beaumont is covered in snow
G D C
When the wind don't blow in Amarillo
C D G
Darlin' then you can come back home
Em
But don't hold your breath
C D G
then you can come back home <start> Sometimes I want to throw my arms around you
And I tremble at the thought of giving in
Because I know how much it cost to love you
And I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you revives the sorrow
That wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow
But I'm so afraid of losing you again
If heaven were to hear my heart's confession
Wanting you would be my greatest sin
But I'm glad that you're no longer my possession
'Cause I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you...
Yes I'm so afraid of losing you again <start> Nothing Good About Lonely

I'm staring out the window
On a bright and sunny day
And even though it's beautiful
To me it still looks grey
The condition of my heart is in a desolate state
There's nothin' good about lonely
It hurts like hell
And although I've never been down there
I've felt enough pain to know it just as well
I feel so empty
Without you here to hold me
I'm trying so hard to be happy
But there's nothin' good about lonely
I thought a change of scenery
Would change my point of view
But even the magical ocean
Was just another shade of blue
Getting outta bed is getting harder to do <start> Kentucky
You are the dearest land outside of Heaven to me
Kentucky
I miss your laurel and your redbud trees
When I die
I want to rest upon a graceful mountain so high
For that is
Where God will look for me
Kentucky
I miss the old folks singing in the silvery moonlight
Kentucky
I miss the hound dogs chasin' ooooonnn
I know that
My mother dad and sweetheart are waiting for me
Kentucky
I will be coming soon
Kentucky <start> Had 'em dressed in their Sunday best calling me dirty words
Had a few drive by shootin' me the bird
Nightstalking me callin' my phone blowing up
Going all Carrie Underwood on my truck
They get crazy and mean
And everything in between
You can't blame no one else
When you brought it all on yourself
Don't tick her off break her heart tell her lies
Don't feed her any lipstick alibis
Ain't nothing she can't see through
No telling what she might do
Maybe get halfdrunk halfwild and wanna fight
Keep yelling at you cussing at you all night
Hellbent on tearing you something new
When she goes all country on you
I've had 'em burn my clothes in a barrel in the front yard
Revenging and binging up my credit cards
Post pictures of me naked with my ink showing through
In the places no one knew there were tattoos
Don't tick her off break her heart tell her lies
Don't feed her any lipstick alibis
Ain't nothing she can't see through
No telling what she might do
Maybe get halfdrunk halfwild and wanna fight
Keep yelling at you cussing at you all night
Hellbent on tearing you something new
When she goes all country on you
They go out of their heads
Hell yeah they get all red
But you can't blame no one else
When you brought it all on yourself
Don't tick her off break her heart tell her lies
Don't feed her any lipstick alibis
Ain't nothing she can't see through
No telling what she might do
Maybe get halfdrunk halfwild and wanna fight
Keep yelling at you cussing at you all night
Hellbent on tearing you something new
When she goes all country on you
Don't tick her off break her heart tell her lies
Don't feed her any lipstick alibis
Ain't nothing she can't see through
When she goes all country on you
Come on <start> People steal they cheat and lie
For wealth and what it will buy
But don't they know on judgment day
That gold and silver will melt away
I'd rather be in a dark grave
And to know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul
What good is gold and silver too
If your hearts not pure and true
Sinner hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray <start> There's a difference in the way she feels when I touch her now
I can tell that something's wrong but I can't put my finger on when the why or how
And there's a coldness in the way she swears I'm not the reason she's not in the mood
And it tears me up inside to lie here next to her while she lies to me about you
She thinks I don't know but I'm about to lose control
She's the kinda love that builds you up enough but she can't stand to be alone
Hell's what I'm gonna raise 'cause I'm hell bent on a change
Buddy finish your drink its on me then get up and walk away
You see I've known her long enough to know how she was before she was mine
And I'm not oblivious its just I've been the only one for all this time
So now you know the reason I came in here tonight to put an end to this romance
There's nothing you can say or do to prove to me that shes not worth a second chance
She still thinks I don't know but I'm about to lose control
She's the kinda love that builds you up enough but she can't stand to be alone
Hell's what I'm gonna raise 'cause I'm hell bent on a change
Buddy finish your drink hell its on me then get up and walk away <start> Two black Cadillacs driving in a slow parade
Headlights shining bright in the middle of the day
One is for his wife
The other for the woman who loved him at night
Two black Cadillacs meeting for the first time
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry
Bye bye bye bye
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye bye bye bye Bye
Two black Cadillacs two black Cadillacs
Two months ago his wife called the number on his phone
Turns out he'd been lying to both of them for oh so long
They decided then he'd never get away with doing this to them
Two black Cadillacs waiting for the right time the right time
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry
Bye bye bye bye
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye bye bye bye Bye
Yeah yeah
It was the first and the last time they saw each other face to face
They shared a crimson smile and just walked away
And left the secret at the grave
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry
Bye bye bye bye
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye bye bye bye Bye
Yeah yeah yeah yeah <start> I heard that warnin' whistle blowin'
I knew that train was comin' fast
The sound of the wheels was hypnotisin'
I could not move from it's path
I just stood there glued to the tracks
Chorus
It was a long time comin'
She was a heartbreak waitin' to happen
And I went right along
It was a long time comin'
Before I knew what hit me she was gone
She was so gone
Those cold black eyes that burned right through me
Could melt a heart of steel
I just pulled her closer to me
'Cause I loved the way it made me feel
Underneath her wheels
Chorus
It was a long time comin'
Before I knew what hit me she was gone
Before I knew what hit me she was gone
She was so gone so gone
So gone
So gone <start> I am not a devil
I am not a saint
You can't tell if the wood is good
By looking at the paint
It's not that I don't love you
Some words are just hard for me to say
I wish I was a poet
But honey I'm not built that way
I know someone hurt you
But that's all in the past
He was one to hit and run
But I don't' work like that
I'm gonna take forever
To finish what we started here today
I just can't' lie about it
Honey I'm not built that way
I'm built to go the distance
Solid as a rock
I climb all my mountains to the top
I won't' run for cover
Even when our sunny skies turn gray
Honey I'm not built that way
Saying it is one thing proving it takes time
But the thought that I don't love you
Should never cross your mind
I'm built to go the distance
Solid as a rock
I climb all my mountains to the top
I won't' run for cover
Even when our sunny skies turn gray
Honey I'm not built that way
Saying it is one thing proving it takes time
But the thought that I don't love you
Should never cross your mind
Built that way
I'm not built that way <start> Yippeeyay there'll be no wedding bells for today
I got spurs that jingle jangle jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing 'Oh ain't you glad you're single
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
Oh Lily Bell oh Lily Bell
Though I may have done some foolin this is why I never fell
I got spurs that jingle jangle jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing 'Oh ain't you glad you're single'
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
Oh Mary Ann oh Mary Ann
Though I've done some moonlight walking this is why I up and went
I got spurs that jingle jangle jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing 'Oh ain't you glad you're single'
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
Oh Sally Jane oh Sally Jane
Though I'd love to stay forever this is why I can't remain
I got spurs that jingle jangle jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing 'Oh ain't you glad you're single'
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
Oh Bessy Lou oh Bessy Lou
Though we've done a heap of dreamin' this is why it won't come true
I got spurs that jingle jangle jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing 'Oh ain't you glad you're single'
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
So I'll go jingling ajangling ajingling along <start> There goes the train that carried my girl from town
If I knowed her number Lord I'd flag her down
Wish to the Lord that the train would wreck
Kill that engineer and break the fireman's neck
Hey the train that carried my girl from town
Hey hey hey hey
Where was you when the train left town
I stand on the corner with my head hung down
If I had my gun I'd let the hammer down
Lord I'd shoot that rounder that took my girl from town
Hey that train that carried my girl from town
Hey hey hey hey
Rations on the table and the coffee's getting cold
And some dirty rounder took my jelly roll
Hello Central give me sixonine
I want to talk to that woman of mine
Hey that train that carried my girl from town
Hey hey hey hey
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Can you show me that woman that a man can trust
There goes my girl somebody bring her back
'Cause she got her hand in my money sack
Hey that train that carried my girl from town
Hey hey hey hey <start> Hey girl hey where ya goin'
Come back and sit back down
You look too good to be
heading home so early now
You say you gotta work tomorrow
Got a lot on your mind
Let me buy another round
Girl I think you and I should just
Drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl we just need to drink on it
We can talk rocket science
Jesus or politics
How your boyfriend cheated on you
Man he sounds like such a prick
I could use another whiskey
And your Cosmo's gettin' low
While we're trying to figure out
The next place we should go
We can drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl we just need to drink on it
This place is closing down
But I don't wanna quit
Gotta good thing going girl
Let's find out what it is
And drink on it
Your place or mine
Girl we can drink on it
Dust off a bottle and drink on it
Feels like we're doin' something right
Let's find a corner of the night
Where you and I can just drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl we just need to drink on it
Might make a memory that we won't forget
So let's just drink on it <start> I'll love you more than you need should you need it
Too much love never gets in the way
I'll love you and want to spend my life with you
And I believe your love for me is complete
But if along the way you should stumble
We'll have more than we need to get us through
I'll love you more than you need should you need it
To help you up should you fall along the way
I'll love you more than you need should you need it
Too much love never gets in the way
Too much love never gets in the way <start> The night is young
The air is cold
Thinking about you's
Never getting old
And even though your gone
Im never letting go
I cant understand why u left me
Out in the cold
But I guess your right it was my fault
And I shouldn't have let you go
Im falling even more in love with you
Waiting here until u make the move
Sitting down pretending that I'm with you
Hoping that your thinking about me to
I no we had to draw the line
Just know a real love is hard to find
But now were on our own
And we got no where to go
Life without you is like an airplane
Thats flying to slow
But before we crash and burn
Can we give it one more go
Im falling even more in love with you
Waiting here until u make the move
Sitting down pretending that I'm with you
Hoping that your thinking about me to <start> Someone found the letter you wrote me on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must've fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name but I knew just who they meant
Oh I was so surprised and shocked and I wondered too
If by chance you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I'd been feeling over you
But they said it really loud and said it on the air
On the radio
Oh... on the radio
Oh... on the radio
Oh...
Now don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing I want to hear is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be coming home real soon
Oh... he kinda a made me feel proud when I heard him say
You couldn't find the words to say it for yourself
And now in my heart I know I can say what I really mean
'Cause they said it really loud they said it on the air
On the radio
Oh... on the radio
Oh... on the radio
Oh...
Now if you think that love isn't found on the radio
Then tune right in you may find the love lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
He found he really lied he said he really lied
On the radio
Oh... on the radio
Oh... on the radio
Oh... <start> Some men like the horses
Some men like to drink
Some men like to scratch their chins and
Sit around and think
Some men like the pulpit
Some men like the pew
But every man every man likes you
Some men like the money
Some men like the fame
Some men like little letters
Following their name
Different strokes for different blokes
Until you come in view
Cause every man every man likes you
When we're walking down the street
You're turning every head
Girl your skirts are way to short
And your lipstick's way too red
I don't like it but I love it
Tell me what's a boy to do
Cause every man every man likes you
Some men like a red head
Some men like brunettes
Some are fond of a golden blonde
And some could not care less
That all goes out the window
When you walk into the room
Cause every man every man likes you <start> If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
If I swore you were an angel
Would you treat me like the devil tonight
If I were dying of thirst
Would your flowing love come quench me
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
Now we can talk all night about the weather
Tell you 'bout my friends out on the coast
I could ask a lot of crazy questions
Or I could ask what I really want to know
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
If I swore you were an angel
Would you treat me like the devil tonight
If I were dying of thirst
Would your flowing love come quench me
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
The rain can fall so soft against the window
The sun can shine so bright up in the sky
But daddy always told me Don't make small talk
He said Come on out and say what's on your mind
So if I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
If I swore you were an angel
Would you treat me like the devil tonight
If I were dying of thirst
Would your flowing love come quench me
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
If I swore you were an angel
Would you treat me like the devil tonight <start> 
I feel so out of place here
With this high society
These high fallutin' people
Don't know what to make of me
I feel like a minnow in a sea of Moby Dicks
A small fry in a big pan
They're caviar  I'm fish sticks
Fish out of water
I know I don't belong
Fish out of water
Everything I do is wrong
My style of hair the clothes I wear
The way I speak the things I eat
The way I act my lack of tact
Nothin' seems to fit
Fish out of water
Flounderin' round
Out of my element
But I'm just as good as they are
Why do I feel second rate
It's like Sorry Charlie
We want only tuna with good taste
I guess you could say WalMart
Is quite a way from Gucci's
I'm Timex they're Rolex
I'm Captain D's they're sushi
Fish out of water
I've had it to the gills
Fish out of water
With these yuppieguppie frills
Yeah I'm a square in a round hole
A catfish in a goldfish bowl
A little fish with lots of soul
Out of my element
Fish out of water
Flounderin' round just for the Halibut
Save me save me
S.O.S. somebody
Save me save me
Somebody rescue me
Fish out of water
Somebody throw me in
Fish out of water
On a scale of one to ten
I'm a two perhaps a three
Compared to the big fish in the sea
I'm washed ashore so save me please
I'm in an awful fix
Fish out of water
Rescue me
And you better do it quick
Fish out of water
It's such a culture shock
Fish out of water
My stomach's tied in knots
Fish out of water
Fish out of water <start> I want to tell you all the story
'Bout the Harper Valley widow wife
Who had a teenage daughter
Who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well her daughter came home one afternoon
And didn't even stop to play
She said Mama I got a note here
From the Harper Valley PTA
Well the note said
Mrs. Johnson you're a wearing your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been
Drinking and a running round with men and goin' wild
We don't believe you ought to be a
Bringing up your little girl this way
It was signed by the secretary
Harper Valley PTA
Well it happened that the PTA
Was gonna meet that very afternoon
They were sure surprised when
Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And then she walked up to the blackboard
I still recall the words she had to say
She said I'd like to address this meeting of the
Harper Valley PTA
Well there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there
And seven times he's asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use
A lotta ice whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker can you tell us
Why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down
Well Mr. Harper couldn't be here
'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath
You'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me
You think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Payton Place
And you're all Harper Valley hypocrites
No I wouldn't put you on
Because it really did it happened just this way
The day my mama socked it to the
Harper Valley PTA
The day my mama socked it to the
Harper Valley PTA <start> Oh I'm thinking of you little darling
On the day that we first met
And those words sweetheart that you told me
I'm sure I'll never forget
Oh someday sweetheart when you're lonely
And have no one to care for you
Remember the heart you have broken
And the one that has loved you so true
You told me that you always would love me
That no one could ever come between
But it seems to me you've forgotten
All those things you told to me
I'll forget all those things that you told me
And try to start our life anew
But remember the heart you have broken
And the one that has loved you so true <start> It used to be that
You could up and thumb a ride from Nashville to L.A.
And everyone who stopped and picked you up
Would get you high along the way
And it used to be that
You could fall in and out of love in an afternoon
And then fall again that evening
And not think that it was happening too soon
Chorus
But it's hard to be a hippie anymore
It hurts more now
Waking up on the floor
Oh it's still free
But it ain't easy like before
It's hard to be a hippie anymore
Fire it up boys
It used to be just walking down the street
Would make the people stop and stare
Now all the cowboys and the preppies
And the rednecks and the yuppies have long hair
But I was always going places
In my head and seeing things that blew my mind
Now the only thing I'm trippin' on
Are my own two feet trying to keep up with the times
Ah yeah you know that's right
Chorus
But it's hard to be a hippie anymore
It hurts more now
Waking up on the floor
Oh it's still free
But it ain't easy like before
It's hard to be a hippie anymore
Lord it's still free
But it ain't easy like before
It's hard to be a hippie anymore <start> Far across the blue waters
Lives an old German's daughter
By the banks of the old river Rhine
Where I loved her and left her
But I can't forget her
'Cause I miss my pretty Fraulein
Fraulein Fraulein
Look up toward the heavens each night
When the stars seem to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
You are my pretty Fraulein
When my memories wander
Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
A face comes before me
The face of my pretty Fraulein
Fraulein Fraulein
Walk down by the river
Pretend that your hand's holding mine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you <start> You always tell me
I'm just one more thing to break
You wonder why
I want to fall apart that way
Crack my reason
Wearing you pretty face
Dropped me a couple times
I come around anyway
Demolition by words
Wrecked all over town
Working for one break
Head down passed out
You always tell me
I'm just one more thing to hide
Your friends don't know me
And they wonder where you go
Take it on another phone
Putdowns in code
I've got my own ring
You might not be alone
Leave me everywhere
Waking up on a floor
Locked in a nightclub
Breaking out the back door
You always tell me
I'm just one more thing to break <start> The ladies began to loose their smile
Sat on their porches and watched her walk her first long mile
tight long jeans and short blond hair
Every man couldnapost help but stare
my momma told me to stay away
warned me that girls like her never stay
but her eyes are as blue as the sea
but my heart starts to pinch when she looks at me when she looks at me
sheaposs a hot lovinapos lady
Whataposs wrong with that
sheaposs a smart talking lady
whataposs wrong with that whataposs wrong with that
Before I knew it we were laughing away
the sun went down it turned into another day
she said that she loved me
carved our names into the trunk of a tree
weeks past and things dissolved
Wasnapost much for anyone to try and solve
my momma was right and i was wrong
tried to play the game and it didnapost last all that long <start> There's dust on mother's Bible its pages are worn with age
And though it's old and wrinkled mama's there on every page
The night the angels called her mama called me to her side
And she handed me her old Bible said son let this be your guide
Now I picked up mama's old Bible and to my heart I pressed it tight
And I thought I could hear her whisper ever so gently
Son I'll meet you on the other side
I kissed my mama's old Bible and I wiped away the dust
Oh you'll never know until she's gone how you miss your mother's love <start> In the lobby of a big hotel in New York Town one day
Sat a bunch of fellows telling yarns to pass the time away
They told of places where they'd been and different things they'd seen
Some preferred Chicago Town while others New Orleans
I can see the cattle grazing o'er the hills at early morn
I can see the campfires smoking at the breaking of the dawn
I can hear the bronco's neighing I can hear the cowboy sing
I'd like to be in Texas for the roundup in the spring
In a corner in an old armchair sat a man whose hair was gray
He listened to them eagerly to what they had to say
They asked him where he'd like to be his clear old voice did ring
I'd like to be in Texas for the roundup in the spring
I can see the cattle grazing o'er the hills at early morn
I can see the campfires smoking at the breaking of the dawn
I can hear the bronco's neighing I can hear the cowboy sing
I'd like to be in Texas for the roundup in the spring
They sat and listened carefully to each word he had to say
They knew the old man sitting there had been a top hand in his day
They asked him for a story of his life out on the plains
Slowly he removed his hat then quietly began
I've seen 'em stampede o'er the hills till you'd think they'd never stop
I've seen 'em run for miles and miles until their leader dropped
I was a foreman of a cow ranch the calling of a king
I'd like to be in Texas for the roundup in the spring
I can see the cattle grazing o'er the hills at early morn
I can see the campfires smoking at the breaking of the dawn
I can hear the bronco's neighing I can hear the cowboy sing
I'd like to be in Texas for the roundup in the spring
I'd like to sleep my last long sleep with mother earth for bed
My saddle for a pillow the bright stars overhead
Then I could hear the last stampede the songs of rivers sing
Way back down in Texas for the roundup in the spring <start> They say I'm like my daddy always on the roam
I know he love my mama but he couldn't stay at home
I vowed to not be like him but somewhere I went wrong
Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere and the girl I love at home
One of these days I'm gonna quit my wandering
One of these days I'll wander back to you
My sweetheart writes me letters they find me now and then
I've send her funny postcards to show her where I've been
She always writes I love you though we're miles apart
But none of funny postcards can't say what's in my heart
One of these days...
I feel the cold winds blowing blowing up a storm
I go to sleep and I always dream that you're here in my arms
And then a lonesome whistle starts blowin' down the line
Wake up boy my buddy says we're a long way from Caroline
One of these days...
One of these days I'll wander back to you <start> I have heard of a land on a faraway strand
Tis a beatiful home of the soul
Built by Jesus on high there we never shall die
Tis a land land where we never grow old
In that beautiful home where we'll never more roam
We shall be in the sweet by and by
And give praise to the king through eternity sing
Tis a land where we never shall die
Never grow old never grow old
In a land where we'll never grow old
Never grow old never grow old
In a land where we'll never grow old
When our work here is done and the life crown is won
And our troubles and trials are all o'er
All our sorrow will end and our voices will blend
With the loved ones who have gone on before <start> I dreamed I went to heaven
You were there with me
We walked along the streets of gold
Beside the crystal sea
We heard the angels singing
Then someone called your name
You turned and saw a young man
He was smiling as he came
He said friend you may not know me now
But then he said but wait
You used to teach my Sunday school
When I was only eight
Every week you would say a prayer
Before the class would start
One morning when you said that prayer
I asked Jesus in my heart
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave
Then another man stood before you
And said remember the time
A missionary came to your church
His pictures made you cry
You didn't have much money
But you gave it anyway
Jesus took the gift you gave
And that's why I'm here today
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave
One by one they came
As far as the eye could see
Each one somehow touched
By your generosity
Little things that you had done sacrifices made
Unnoticed on the earth heaven now proclaims
And I know up in heaven
That you're not supposed to cry
But I was almost sure
There were tears in your eyes
As Jesus took your hand
And you stood before the Lord
And He said my child look around you
For great is your reward
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave
I am so glad you gave
I am so glad you gave <start> I blew out all my plans
The world fell in my hands
The day that I began
Trying to love you
The secrets I have kept
The nights I haven't slept
I've laughed until I've wept
Trying to love you
Trying to love you... No one's come as close or gone so far
Trying to love you... I've lost and found myself in who you are
Trying to love you... So easy and so hard trying to love you
I've watched myself get stuck
Squandered all my luck
But I cannot give up
Trying to love you
Trying to love you... It broke my heart it's chipped away my pride
Trying to love you... Everytime I'd see that faultline slide
Trying to love you... I've crossed the great divide trying to love you
Instrumental Break
Trying to love you... I've screamed your name I've slammed a thousand doors
Trying to love you... I've worn a million miles across the floor
Trying to love you... Still I could not ignore trying to love you
It's pulled the best from me
For all the world to see
And I will always be
Trying to love you <start> You could be uptown livin' high rise sippin' on some good champagne
You could be Hollywood hills throwin' down bills like you're makin' it rain
You could be down in that line in Detroit city or up on top sittin' pretty
Smokin' a big cigar I don't care who you are
'Cause everybody's got a little dirt road in 'em
Yeah you know what I'm talkin' about
We all bring a little small town with us
No matter where your sun goes down
Everybody's got a tailgate even if it ain't
On the back of some pickup truck
Pass the fried chicken
Everybody's got a little dirt road in 'em
Everybody's got a little dirt road in 'em
Hey there baby what say we find a little lazy creek
Kick off them high heeled shoes and show me them pretty bare feet
Trade in them city lights and downtown bars for a couple million blinking stars
And a big full moon get on back to your roots
'Cause everybody's got a little dirt road in 'em
Yeah you know what I'm talkin' about
We all bring a little small town with us
No matter where your sun goes down
Everybody's got a tailgate even if it ain't
On the back of some pickup truck
Pass the fried chicken
'Cause everybody's got a little dirt road in 'em
Oh yeah
No matter where you come from you know you got some
Down home money water running through your veins
Might be a big ol' world but we're all the same
'Cause everybody's got a little dirt road in 'em
Yeah you know what I'm talkin' about
We all bring a little small town with us
No matter where your sun goes down
Everybody's got a tailgate even if it ain't
On the back of some pickup truck
Pass the fried chicken
'Cause everybody's got a little dirt road in 'em
Oh yeah
Everybody's got a little dirt road in 'em
Yes they do now
'Cause everybody's got a little dirt road in 'em
Yeah you know what I'm talkin' about
We all bring a little small town with us
No matter where your sun goes down
Everybody's got a tailgate even if it ain't <start> I believe my steps are growing wearier each day
Still I've got a journey on my mind
Lures of this old world have ceased to make me want to stay
And my one regret is leaving you behind
If it proves to be his will that I am first to go
And somehow I have a feeling it will be
When it comes your times to travel likewise don't feel lost
For I will be the first one that you'll see
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be waiting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming I will rise up with the shout
And come running through the shallow waters reaching for your hand
Through this life we've labored hard to earn our meager fare
It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes
I'll just rest here on the shore and turn my eyes away
Until you come then we'll see paradise
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be waiting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming I will rise up with the shout
And come running through the shallow waters reaching for your hand
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be waiting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming I will rise up with the shout
And come running through the shallow waters reaching for your hand <start> Today I started loving you again
And so I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again
What a fool I was to think I could get by
On only these few million tears I've cried
Then I should have known the worst was yet to come
And that crying time for me had just begun
Today I started loving you again
And so I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again
Yes today I started loving you again <start> The news is out all over town
That you've been seen out runnin' around
I know that I should leave but then
I just can't go
You win again
This heart of mine could never see
what everybody knows but me
Just trusting in you was my great sin
What can I do
You Win Again
Yes this heart of mine could never see
what everybody knows but me
Just trusting you was my great sin
What can I do
You Win Again <start> The Chev got stuck and the Ford got stuck
But the Chev unstuck when the Dodge showed up
But the Dodge got stuck in the tractor rut
Which eventually pulled out the Ford
With some difficulty
Well more rain than wed seen for a thousand years
Caused financial joys and biblical fears
It caused some smiles it caused some tears
But more to the point of our story
For The first time in the collective memory
That old brown prairie that had been so dry for so long was very muddy
Boggy and sticky
Wed pull one truck out and get another stuck in
And motors would roar and tires would spin
Wed sink right down down to the diff and wed all take turns and do it again
Till no one could move wed call one more friend
Come on out here we need youbring your truck
The Chev got stuck and the Ford got stuck
But the Chev unstuck when the Dodge showed up
But the Dodge got stuck in the tractor rut
Which eventually pulled out the Ford
And the Dodge
They got me stuck in the mud so they couldnt rehearse
And Chavase too has missed his work
Richie he now fears the worst he stood up his ex wife she called him a jerk
Course Holman didnt have nothing better do to cept ranch.
The Chev got stuck and the Ford got stuck
But the Chev unstuck when the Dodge showed up
But the Dodge got stuck in the tractor rut
Which eventually pulled out the Ford
Well it was truck after truck we all got stuck
cept the big old four by hutterite truck
We all thought lord are we in luck
But he wouldnt come anywhere near us
Mighty neighborly mighty neighborly.
So we used a lot of our backs a little of our brains
We jacked up the jacks and snugged up the chains
We all did our very best to refrain from shovelin.
We put what timber we had underneath the wheels
And we was all out of sand but managed to steal
Two sacks of the best modern canola seed you ever did see
That oughta give us some traction
The Chev got stuck and the Ford got stuck
But the Chev unstuck when the Dodge showed up
But the Dodge got stuck in the tractor rut
Which eventually pulled out the Ford
We spilled genetically modified canola seed
That was genetically modified for controlling the weeds
And for big old yields and margarine oil raised hell all over that native prairie soil
Agriculture Canada is definitely gonna be looking for us <start> It was a cold and dark December night
But a star still lit the sky
Away in a manger you heard a baby cry
It was the cry of the Son of God
A little baby boy
Born in that manger to bring the world joy
So hush up little baby
You know not what you'll do
You'll bring the world peace and love
And teach them while you do
You have nothing to fear because you know
God is with you all the way
That little important baby
Born on Christmas day
Many people soon gathered round that tiny run down barn
They knew not of what they saw
Then came three all dressed in fancy robes silks and furs
This was the first indication of the importance of his birth
So hush up little baby
You know not what you'll do
You'll bring the world peace and love
And teach them while you do
You have nothing to fear because you know
God is with you all the way
That little important baby
Born on Christmas day
We expected a soldier to save us from our plight
All dressed in shiny armor ready for a fight
But instead he sent a little baby boy
All filled with love happiness
To bring the world joy
So hush up little baby
You know not what you'll do
You'll bring the world peace and love
And teach them while you do
You have nothing to fear because you know
God is with you all the way
That little important baby
Born on Christmas day <start> Sitting in the barroom ordering another beer
She stepped up on the stage but nobody wanted to hear
And every word she sang was sweet music to my ears
Elise Elise I believe every word you say
Elise Elise I believe every word you say
It don't matter if the world don't listen
Don't you pay no heed
Elise Elise come and sing your song with me
I sat there at the bar she sang the blues all night
Singing straight from the heart living every line
I wanna tell you girl you touched this heart of mine
Elise Elise I believe every word you say
Elise Elise I believe every word you say
End of the night well they turned the lights down low
While the band packed up she was standing there ready to go
I walked up and said Hey I just want to let you know
Elise Elise I believe every word you say
Elise Elise I believe every word you say
It don't matter if the world don't listen
Don't you pay no heed
Elise Elise come and sing your song with me
Elise Elise come and sing your song with me <start> Down at the railroad station there's people gettin' on
Some are a goin' north some are a goin' south I'm just goin' to be gone
Some people are born to be takers others just want to give
Some people live just to love but I just love to live
For I was just born to be exactly what you see
Nothing more or less I'm not the worst or the best
I just try to be exactly what you see today and every day I'm just me
When people say their life is rough I wonder compared to what
Some are wantin' more and more's gettin' less I just want what I've got
Some want to live on a hill others down by the sea
Some want to live inside high walls I just want to live free
For I was just born...
Oh I was just born to be exactly what you see today and every day I'm just me <start> I was thinking bout the perfect words
To say to that living doll
By the time that I had worked it out
She was half way down the hall
My schoolboy fears of being shot down
Kept that dream from getting off the ground
Lookin back I figured out I thought about it too long
Sometimes you just gotta jump in get yourself movin
Countdown the clock is runnin
Sometimes theres no time to doubt it just gotta do it
Dont even think about it
So baby if it seems Im coming on too strong
Its just that I dont want to feel this feeling gone
'cause in this moment there could be a golden opportunity
To tell you what you mean to me
Dont want to think about it too long
Chorus
Solo
Chorus
Dont even think about it <start> If I've but one life to live let me live it with you
If I've but one heart to give let me give it to you
You're all that matters to me and that's how it should be
If I've but one life to live let me live it with you
My life is nothing without you I'm as lost as can be
But when you come into my view happiness is all I see
If I've but one life to live... <start> Watching the long faces
Riding this run down track
And the lost places
From a dream that never brings them back
And the sad truth is nothing but a cold hard fact
I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train
Counting the burned bridges
Trailing this rusted wreck
As our back pages
Scatter in the dust we left
Like a pearl necklace
Fallen from around your neck
I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train
Away down the low road
A ticket to an empty room
A rendezvous unknown
I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train <start> You don't know if it's hello or goodbye
What kind of tears they are when they get cried
All you know is somebody is coming or leaving
It don't really matter whatever the reason
Something about them gets me every time
Kisses at airports wideopen car doors
So slow to let go wrapped up with eyes closed
Some mean I missed you some mean I'm going to
But somehow they mean more
Kisses at airports
There was a crayon cardboard Welcome home Daddy sign
When he got the deployed she was just two pink lines
And now it's sunburned lips on ten little fingers
And one for her mama yeah that one lingers
I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only one at baggage claim to cry
Kisses at airports thanking the good Lord
You didn't die out there without seeing that curly red hair
And that's why you hang on and that's how you make it home
Got something to live for
Kisses at airports
Oh oh
When you dropped me off I was running late
I just grabbed my bags and ran to the gate
But what if I had never landed
How many times do we take for granted
Like kisses at airports wideopen car doors
No I don't want to let go
I just want to make sure you know
This one means I miss you this one means I'm going to
Make every one I give you baby be a little more
Like kisses at airports
Like kisses at airports <start> Here Comes My Baby Back Again
Here comes more tears to cry
Here comes more heartaches by
Here comes my baby back again
Here comes more misery
Here come old memories
Here comes my baby back again
My arms are open wide
To let more hurt inside
Here comes my baby back again
He's sorry once again
Once more I'll understand
Here comes my baby back again
My arms are open wide
To let more hurt inside
Here comes my baby back again
He's sorry once again
Once more I'll understand
Here comes my baby back again
Here comes my baby back again <start> See them tumbling down
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
Cares of the past are behind
Nowhere to go but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
I know when night has gone
That a new world's born at dawn
I'll keep rolling along
Deep in my heart is a song
Here on the range I belong
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds <start> We could go down to the lake
Throw off our shoes
Jump into the water like there's nothing to lose
Sky don't get no bluer love don't get no truer than this
Then you could wrap me in a blanket
And steal a kiss
Then we could go into town
To that little coffee shop
Go sit under the stars up on the rooftop
Spend an hour talking watch the people walking by
When the coffee gets colder you can just hold me tight
Something special something we don't do all the time
Something special 'cause I am yours and you are mine
A little celebration just because we can
Walking by your side with my hand in your hand
Make a little history make the kind of memories that last
Stop and smell the roses
you know they go so fast
Something special something we don't do all the time <start> Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la la la la la
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la la la la la
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa la la la la la la la la
Troll the ancient Yuletide carol
Fa la la la la la la la la
See the blazing Yule before us
Fa la la la la la la la la
Strike the harp and join the chorus
Fa la la la la la la la la
Follow me in merry measure
Fa la la la la la la la la
While I tell of Yuletide treasure
Fa la la la la la la la la
Fast away the old year passes
Fa la la la la la la la la
Hail the new year lads and lasses
Fa la la la la la la la la
Sing we joyous all together
Fa la la la la la la la la
Heedless of the wind and weather
Fa la la la la la la la la
Fa la la la la la la la la <start> When you called me and said you had to see me
I thought you meant to start our life anew
But you told me you would wed tomorrow
And you just wanted one last rendezvous
Tonight is our last night together at dawn
Till tomorrow you'll be gone
But darling this night would last forever
If I could hold back the dawn
When you walk down the aisle with him tomorrow
To take his name and whisper 'Dear I do'
Will you be thinkin' of the future darling
Or thinkin' of my last night with you
I wish you'd never mention your tomorrow
Darling when you call me on the phone
But there wouldn't be a new tomorrow
If I could hold back the dawn <start> You've finally arrived at the goals that you set
You thought that was it boy oh but you can't quit yet
There's a lonesome old road and it starts at the top
You got one way to go now and it's a mighty fast drop
You know freedom ain't free and glory ain't cheep
The prize that you gained it's a crown you can't keep
Oh when you finally won at vanity's game
Is the title you hold worth the price you paid
You wrote your own song and you lived your own life
But something went wrong 'cause the feelin' ain't right
Oh you've got it all but the magic's all gone
You're at the top of the world boy but you're standing alone
You know freedom ain't free and glory ain't cheep
The prize that you gained it's a crown you can't keep
Oh when you finally won at vanity's game
Is the title you hold worth the price you paid <start> Who cares for fame or fortune
Who cares for wealth or gold
Because I find a fortune
Within my arms I hold
A tiny turned up nose
Two cheeks just like a rose
So sweet from head to toes
That little boy of mine
Two arms that hold me tight
Two eyes that shine so bright
Two lips that kiss goodnight
That little boy of mine
No one will ever know
Just what his coming has meant
Because I love him so
He's something heaven has sent
He's all the world to me
He climbs upon my knee
To me he'll always be
That little boy of mine
And when he lays his head
Upon his pillow so white
I pray the Lord above
To guide him safe through the night
In dreams I see his face
And feel his fond embrace
There's no one can replace
That little boy of mine. <start> Yes I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
She's always on my mind
Her memory goes round and round
I've tried to quit a thousand times
Yes I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
Fill the glass up to the top
I'll start with lovin' her
But I don't know when to stop
I wake up and right away
Her name is on my lips
Once the memories start to flow
I can't stop with just one sip
Yes I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
She's always on my mind
Her memory goes round and round
I've tried to quit a thousand times
Yes I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
Fill the glass up to the top
I'll start with lovin' her
But I don't know when to stop
I keep on remembering
How good it used to be
Gettin' stoned all alone
On my favorite memory
Yes I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
She's always on my mind
Her memory goes round and round
I've tried to quit a thousand times
Yes I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
Fill the glass up to the top
I'll start with lovin' her
But I don't know when to stop
I'll start with lovin' you
But I don't know when to stop <start>  cups of coffee and I'm back on the road
 miles to memphis is what the lady told
She smiled and thanked me when she picked up my change
Says you have a safe trip stay out of the rain
Chorus
I'm lookin through the windsheild
Holding back the night
I'm lookin through the windsheild
For the morning light
The song on the radio it used to make you cry
I only heard the last verse then it passed me by
I asked you long ago what you wanted in this life
A long way from memphis you became my wife
Repeat chorus
The coat you wore last winter is the only thing you left behind
I know it's warm in memphis but you might need it some time
It's  miles to memphis but it's best to pass on through
It's the only I took away that I can give back to you
Repeat chorus
I'm lookin through the windsheild
No end in sight
I'm lookin through the windsheild
For the morning light <start> The mix tape's got a little Hank little Drake
A little something bumping thump thumping on the wheel ride
The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think
So get a grip take a sip of that feel right
The truck's jacked up flat bills flipped back
Yeah you can find us where the party's at
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
And this is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon baby
This is how we roll
Yeah baby this is how we roll
We rollin' into town
With nothing else to do we take another lap around
Yeah holla at your boy if you need a ride
If you roll with me yeah you know we rollin' high
Up on and thirty seven needles windows tinted hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat oh
Them kisses are for me though automatic like a free throw
This life I live it might not be for you but it's for me though
Let's roll
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
And this is how we do
When the world turns ugly I just turn and look at you baby
This is how we roll
Yeah we're proud to be young
We stick to our guns
We love who we love and we wanna have fun
Yeah we cuss on them Mondays
And pray on them Sundays
Pass is around and we dream about one day
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
And this is how we ride
We slingin' up the mud cuttin' through the countryside baby
This is how we roll
Yeah this is how we roll
This is how we roll
Yeah this is how we roll
This is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon baby
This is how we roll
Yeah this is how we roll <start> Hoje cedo eu chorei
Acordei com voc na cabea
No pea pra que eu te esquea
Pois tudo no mundo me lembra voc
Hoje cedo tocou
A cano que voc mais gostava
Parece que voc estava comigo
E por isso eu liguei pra voc
Eu tentei eu lutei fiz o possvel
Mas viver sem voc  impossvel
Eu tentei eu busquei outra sada
Mas o que fazer se s d voc na minha vida
Ainda no consegui
Te arrancar daqui do meu peito
Volta e vem dar um jeito
Nesse desacerto do meu corao
Eu no posso fingir
Nem to pouco mentir pra mim mesmo
 caminhar sem rumo a esmo
Pois voc ainda  minha direo
Eu tentei eu lutei fiz o possvel
Mas viver sem voc  impossvel
Eu tentei eu busquei outra sada
Mas o que fazer se s d voc na minha vida
Mas o que fazer se s d voc na minha vida <start> When she left me she thought that I was hurting
She heard that I been crying to her friends
But the truth is I just got a new job acting
So any tear that rolls my cheek is just pretend
I gotta role in some romantic movie
A broken hearted man unlike myself
Well it's hard for me to relate
So I practice night and day
And that's why I've been crying oh so well
I'm not crying over you
I'm not crying over you
You might think so but you're wrong
No that feeling's dead and gone
This crying is just a role I'm working on
Well she said she saw me weeping in a bar room
She said she saw me sobbing all alone
But if she knew the truth about my crying
She'd pack her things and come back to our home
Because I got a roll in some romantic movie
A broken hearted man I unlike myself
Now she'll see me on the screen and take back everything
She'll come back to the man that treats her well
I'm not crying over you
I'm not crying over you
You might think so but you're wrong
No that feeling's dead and gone
This crying is just a role I'm working on
Yes this crying is just a role I'm working on <start> I remember holdin' on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through.
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye.
But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again.
Was I just off somewhere or just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye.
I only miss you every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowin' up from the Caribbean.
Most Novembers I break down and cry
Cause I can't remember if we said goodbye.
But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I will never go in my life again.
Was I just off somewhere or just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye.
No I can't remember if we said goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye. <start> I wasn't made for the sea
So I keep my anger on me
Won't tumble over or fall apart
I lose direction in the dark
I wasn't made for the flow
Hard times it rolls in my blood
I'm half a native
Half alone
I'll never make it on my own
I wasn't made for the rain
The sound brings me back there again
A lonely sailor looking through
The stillest water
Every glimpse of you <start> Oh jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Hey jingle bells jingle bells
Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Oh jingle bells jingle bells
Oh jingle bells jingle bells <start> I watch as you take off your clothes and slip under the sheets
Then I turn and kick the boots off my feet there's no need to speak
Girl beauty like yours is hard to beat
But I'll be gone in the morning in the morning I'll be gone
'Cause I'm not one for hanging on
Please don't think that you done something wrong
In the morning when you wake and find me gone
Just a look from those fiery eyes can all but erase
The memory of any other's face
And the passion they unleash could cause me to misplace
And lose all track of time without a trace
But I'll be gone in the morning in the morning I'll be gone
'Cause I'm not the one for hanging on
Please don't think that you done something wrong
In the morning when you wake and find me gone
The sun intrudes and throws across the room its golden tracks
Shake the dreams now it's back to facts
As I turn to leave I know you had what so many lack
Maybe some day that'll bring me back
But I'll be gone in the morning in the morning I'll be gone
'Cause I'm not one for hanging on
Please don't think that you done something wrong
In the morning when you wake and find me gone
But I'll be gone in the morning in the morning I'll be gone
'Cause I'm not one for hanging on
Please don't think that you done something wrong
In the morning when you wake and find me gone
In the morning when you wake and find me gone <start> Well lovin' you sure is great I follow every step you take
I'm watchin' every move you make oh baby
Don't you know honey child you really got a lovin' kind
I'm lovin' everytime you smile oh baby
Oh oh oh I get this feeling when I'm close to you
Oh oh oh now I can think of anything better
When you and me alone together
I love lovin' you baby
You got to be one of the kind cause everything you do is so fine
Well I think it's all a dream some time oh baby
Lovin' you sure is great I'm watchin' every move that you make
And I follow every step that you take oh baby
Oh oh oh I get this feeling when I'm close to you
Lovin' you sure is great I'm watchin' every move that you make
And I follow every step that you take oh baby <start> As I travel down life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder hope grows fonder
Precious memories flood my soul
Precious father loving mother
Glide across the lonely years
And old home's scenes of my childhood
In fond memories appears
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold <start> That lonely night we got carried away with each other
Remains with me though they'll never be another
Warm drinks soft lights and slow dances
When two blue people were the victim of circumstances
Circumstances the wrong arms the right time
Circumstances was her charms or just a wine
Would it happen again if we had enough chances
Or would we even want each other under different circumstances
What is done is over and just a memory the night they set a sign for you and me
Oh but the dreams this foolish heart romances
Of the night when we were victim of circumstances
Circumstances the wrong arms <start> Tonight doesn't feel like it did last night
I'm feeling warm and different inside
Since I saw your face
Since I looked in your eyes
There's a change in this place
I think the love factor's high
Chorus
When the love factor's high
And too hard to collide
You don't even try
And that's when you'll find
The one that feels right
The one for all time
It's hard to deny
When the love factor's high
Sometimes it flies and sometimes it falls
Sometimes your back
Ends up against the wall
As I hold you close
We dance in time
And I think I know the love factor's high
Chorus <start> Corrine Corrina where you been so long
Corrine Corrina where you been so long
Ain't been no lovin' since you been gone
I love Corrina tell the world I do
I love Corrina tell the world I do <start> I know where I come from
How 'bout you
I don't need baggy clothes
Or rings in my nose to be cool.
The scars on my knuckles
Match these scuffs on these cowboy boots.
An' there's a whole lot more like me
How 'bout you
I punch the clock tryin' to make it to the top
How 'bout you
I ain't got no blueblood trust fund
I can dip in to.
Yeah I wish Uncle Sam would give a damn
About the man who's collar's blue.
But if he don't hell I'll make it on my own
How 'bout you
An' how 'bout you
Do you feel the way I do
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few.
But that's just me
How 'bout you
I still say Yes Ma'am to my Momma
How 'bout you
If I shake your hand look you in the eye
You can bet your ass it'll be the truth.
I cover my heart with my hat
When they fly that Red White and Blue
Just like my Daddy taught me
How 'bout you
An' how 'bout you
Do you feel the way I do
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few.
But that's just me
Well how 'bout you
I like my country rockin'
How 'bout you
Just put me on a stage man
Turn it up an' I'll turn it loose.
Yeah give me a crowd that's redneck an' loud
We'll raise the roof.
Yeah I might just stay all night long.
How 'bout you
Do you feel the way I do
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few.
An' how 'bout you
Do you feel the way I do
'Cause man I know where I come from
How 'bout you <start> Many shoes have taken steps across the treshold
But no shoes were ever crowder than his
On the day he carried me across the treshold
And gave his brand new bride a wedding kiss
Now a hundred heartaches later out the treshold
All his love for me has vanished there's no doubt
And the lips that kissed me coming through the treshold
And they're laughin' now as I go walking out
 steel 
I built my little world behind that treshold I may not have made him happy but I tried
Still his eyes keep looking out across the treshold
For the happiness he thinks he left outside
Now I'm standing all alone at the treshold
All his love for me has vanished there's no doubt
And the lips that kissed me coming through the treshold
And they're laughin' now as I go walking out
I hear him laughin' now as I go walking out <start> Once a day all day long and once a night from dusk till dawn
The only time I wish you weren't gone is once a day every day all day long
When I found somebody new I thought I never would
Forget you for I thought then I never could
But time has taken all the pain away until now I'm down to hurtin' once a day
Once a day all day long...
I'm so glad that I'm not like a friend I knew one time
He lost the one he's loved then slowly lost his mind
He sat around and cried his life away lucky me I'm only crying once a day
Once a day all day long...
Once a day every day all day long <start> Last night I went out with some old friends
I couldn't help but think of you again
Someone was wearing your cologne
What a cruel way to remind me that you're gone
A couple danced over by the jukebox
Hand in hand I thought they'd never stop
They played our song again and again
How could anyone be so insensitive
They're laughing at me I just know it
As if they knew all along I'd blow it
Everywhere I turn
Something reminds me of the way things were
I love you I lost you
I know what a fool I've been
And it seems like the whole world
Keeps rubbin' it in
Every time I turn on the TV
I come across one of our favorite movies
A love story that ends with a kiss
How'd the cable company get in on this
I swear I pass you when I'm on the highway
Since when did everyone drive red Chevrolet's
It never really is your car
I think some people have taken this a little too far
They're laughing at me I just know it
As if they knew all along I'd blow it
Everywhere I turn
Something reminds me of the way things were
I love you I lost you
I know what a fool I've been
And it seems like the whole world
Keeps rubbin' it in
They're laughing at me I just know it
As if they knew all along I'd blow it
Everywhere I turn
Something reminds me of the way things were
I love you I lost you
I know what a fool I've been
And it seems like the whole world
Keeps rubbin' it in
Yeah it seems like the whole world
Keeps rubbin' it <start> You grew up in the city a high society girl
And even this backwoods boy can tell you're a woman of the world
'Cause I get weak when I hear you speak the way they do in France
Well I'm sure you've heard these fancy words but I got to take a chance
Oh s'il vous plait pardonne me I can help myself
Darling jai vous aimes beaucoup it's you and no one else
Forgive me if I say it wrong but I just ain't that smart
If you can't see this love in me then scuse moi my heart
I showed up in New Orleans with all I own on my back
I got me a job at the country club on the rich side of the track
Then you came in with your jet set friends that you met in Paree
Well now they're gone and you're alone looking straight at me
Oh s'il vous plait pardonne me I can help myself
Darling jai vous aimes beaucoup it's you and no one else
Forgive me if I say it wrong but I just ain't that smart
If you can't see this love in me then scuse moi my heart
Why can't we try the language of love
The one thing you can't place yourself above
Oh dont allow your social pride to keep our dreams apart
If you can't see this love in me then scuse moi my heart
Oh s'il vous plait pardonne me I can help myself
Darling jai vous aimes beaucoup it's you and no one else
Forgive me if I say it wrong but I just ain't that smart
If you can't see this love in me then 'scuse' moi my heart
If you can't see this love in me then 'scuse' moi my heart <start> Well it was all
That I could do to keep from crying'
Sometimes it seemed so useless to remain
But you don't have to call me darlin' darlin'
You never even call me by my name
You don't have to call me Waylon Jennings
And you don't have to call me charlie pride
And you don't have to call me Merle haggardanymore
Even though you're on my fighting' side
And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standing' in the rain
But you don't have to call me darlin' darlin'
You never even called me by my name
Well I've heard my name
A few times in your phone book 
And I've seen it on signs where I've played
But the only time I know
I'll hear David Allan Coe
Is when Jesus has his final judgment day
And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standing' in the rain
But you don't have to call me darlin' darlin'
You never even called me by my name
Well a friend of mine named Steve Goodman wrote that song
And he told me it was the perfect country and western song
I wrote him back a letter
And I told him it was not the perfect country and western song
Because he hadn't said anything at all about mama
Or trains
Or trucks
Or prison
Or getting' drunk
Well he sat down and wrote another verse to the song
And he sent it to me
And after reading it
I realized that my friend had written the perfect
Country and western song
And I felt obliged to include it on this album
The last verse goes like this here
Well I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison
And I went to pick her up in the rain
But before I could get to the station in my pickup truck
She got runned over by a damned old train
And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standing' in the rain
No a' you don't have to call me darlin' darlin'
You never even call me
Well I wonder why you don't call me
Why don't you ever call me by my name <start> I left my old home in the mountains
And the only friends I ever had
And while I rambled this world over
My heart felt so lonely and sad
I'm going back to the old home
Back to the place I love so well
Where the sweet waters flow and the wildflowers grow
Back to the old home on the hill
I know that dear old mother's waiting
Waiting alone on that hill
With the silver in her hair and a twinkle in her eye
In the old cabin home on the hill
Years have gone by since I saw her
I've traveled many a mile
But tonight there's a light in the window
And she's waiting at the door with a smile <start> God I'm down here on my knees
Cause it's the last place left to fall
Beggin' for another chance
If there's any chance at all
That you might still be listenin'
Lovin' and forgivin' guys like me
I've spent my whole life gettin' it all wrong
And I sure could use your help cause from now on
I wanna be a good man
A 'do like I should' man
I wanna be the kind of man the mirror likes to see
I wanna be a strong man
And admit that I was wrong man
God I'm asking you to come change me
To the man I wanna be
There's anyway for her and me to make another start
Could you see what you could do
To put some love back in her heart
Cause' it going to take a miracle
After all I've done to really make her see
That I wanna be a stay man
I wanna be a great man
I wanna be the kind of man that she sees in her dreams
God I wanna be your man
And I wanna be her man
God I only hope she still believes
In the man I wanna be
Well I know this late at night that talk is cheap
Lord don't give up on me
I wanna be a givin' man
I wanna really start livin' man
God I'm asking you to come change me
To the man I wanna be <start> When you smile at me
You take me to a world I never thought I'd see
Your eyes can touch my soul
And fill me with a hunger only you can feed
When you smile at me
When you speak my name
Your words of love surround me like a gentle rain
You whisper soft and clear the things I long to hear
It's like an angel's sweet refrain
When you speak my name
There's no love like our love
Our passion knows no end
Together we can soar to heights
That no one's ever known or has ever been
When you kiss me
You fill my mind with dreams of pleasures yet to be
You take me in your arms
And hold me till it's all that I am conscious of endlessly
When you kiss me
There's no love like our love
Our passion knows no end
Together we can soar to heights
That no one's ever known or has ever been
When you smile at me
You take me to a world I never thought I'd see
Your eyes can touch my soul
And fill me with a hunger only you can feed
When you smile at me when you smile at me <start> Everybody says you let me down I should be ashamed to take you round
Makes no difference what you used to do darling I could never be ashamed of you
Maybe you were reckless yesterday but together we can find a brighter way
In my heart I know that you'll come true darling I could never be ashamed of you
 steel 
All the happiness I've ever known came the day you said you'd be my own
And it matters not what we go through darling I could never be ashamed of you
Maybe you were cheated in the past and perhaps those memories will always last
Even though you prove to be untrue darling I could never be ashamed of you <start>  Both 
Healin' hands on the blind and the blind could see I said hallelujah the blind could see
Healin' hands on the bum and the bum was free I said hallelujah the bum was free
Healin' hands on the dumb and the dumb could talk
I said hallelujah the dumb could talk
Healin' hands on the lame and the lame could walk I said hallelujah the lame could walk
 Dallas 
Jesus Christ our Saviour was born in Bethlehem
The son of God almighty the beginning and the end
 Connie 
The miracles of Jesus was the talk all over land
Jesus healed the multitudes by the laying on off hands
 Both 
Healin' hands on the blind...
 Dallas 
The healin' hands of Jesus set to free today
All it talkes is a little pay the size of mustard seed
Now we  I'm with you to the end
Go forth and do the works of God by the laying on off hands
 Both 
Healin' hands on the blind...
Healin' hands on the blind... <start> Well ever since the day that you left me I been whinin' like a little ole pup
Somewhere down when you left town and you ain't a gonna come back up
A walkin' and wearin' out leather a skippin' out the hardwood floor
Starin' at the phone that you've been gone and listenin' for the knock on the door
Well there ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
And they wouldn't shake if it wasn't for the breeze
There ain't nothin' happenin' with the birds and the bees
There ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves
 steel 
Now hurt's lookin' in through the window my heartaches are laughin' in the hall
And I got news that old man blues are peepin' through the cracks in the wall
The end is a waitin' round the corner and hope is just about gone
If you only knew what I need to do then you'd come a running back home
Oh well there ain't nothin' shakin'...
There ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves there ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves <start> Miss me baby
When you hear our favorite song
Miss me baby
And when you start to sing along
Think about all the times that danced in light to it all night long
Oh then miss me baby
You want me honey
Like you did the night you told me that you loved me
You couldn't wait anymore
Left the keys in the door took my hand pulled my down on the kitchen floor
Yeah we were that crazy
Miss me baby
Chorus
Cause when he's holding you
Know that it's killing me
Let my memory be the reason girl that you can't sleep
And every time you feel his touch
I pray to God it's not enough
That I've touched your heart so deep girl you can't shake me
Cause I love you
Yes I need you
Miss me baby
Miss me baby
Til you can't take it no more
Miss me baby
Pack your bags and hit the door
I'm a man I was wrong forgive me come back home I'll be waiting
Right here waiting
Miss me baby
Chorus
And every time you feel his touch
I pray to God it's not enough
That I touched your heart so deep girl you can't shake me
Cause I love you
Yes I need you
Miss me baby
Every time you hear this song
Miss me baby <start> Too many nights I've been awake
We both so lonely we don't know what to say
It's hard to hold on to a dream
When the sacrifice is hurting you and me
I hear your voice on the line
Sounds so sweet I feel like mine
I miss my home
Everything I'm living for is not where I come from
I'll carry on and I'm back in the arms of the one love
'Cause I miss my home
Hope don't come easy faith is hard to find
It's been so long since I had some peace of mind
The only thing that makes me Incomprehensible
Lord my angel waiting there for me tonight
I miss my home
Everything I'm living for is not where I come from
I'll carry on and I'm back in the arms of the one love
'Cause I miss my home
I miss my home
Everything I'm living for is not where I come from
I'll carry on and I'm back in the arms of the one love
'Cause I miss my home
Oh I miss my home <start> Don't look so sad I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that were burning
Lay your head upon my pillow hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops falling soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time for the good times
I'll get along you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
Lay your head upon my pillow <start> I don't love you anymore
We've all heard those words before
Somebody takes your heart and then
Leaves you the pieces
Lying shattered on the floor
They say that when you close a door
Another one is waiting there
For you to open if you believe
Chorus
Love will come back
Hit you when you least expect it
Fill in the cracks
Of a broken heart you thought
That you could never mend
You you can start again
When you're barely getting by
And it's hard to find the strength to try
And loneliness is all you've known
If you let go then you will find
Chorus
Oh when you think you've lost the only way
All you really need
Is a little faith
Chorus
Just let love return to you
You can start again <start> Monday mornin' is such a rush
Here it is again sneakin' up on us
Uhhuhhuh yeah
This is the part you know I don't like
We say goodbye and then we kiss goodnight
Uhhuhhuh yeah
I know it's one o'clock
And we said you'd be gone by ten
So much for those eight hours
I swore that I'd get in
I know I should get some sleep
I'm at the beginnin' of another long week
But I don't want you to go
No I don't want you to go
I guess another minute wouldn't do no harm
Why not spend it in each other's arms
Cause I don't want you to go
No I don't want you to go
We always say just one more kiss
But it always seems to never end like this
Uhhuhhuh yeah
A few dozen then a couple more
Before we know it it's after four
Uhhuhhuh yeah
I know tomorrow my best friend will be my coffee cup
Cause here we go again
Watchin' the sun come up
Yeah I know I should get some sleep
I'm at the beginnin' of another long week
But I don't want you to go
No I don't want you to go
I guess another minute wouldn't do no harm
Why not spend it in each other's arms
Cause I don't want you to go
No baby I don't want you to go
Hey
I know tomorrow my best friend will be my coffee cup
Cause here we go again
Watching the sun come up yeah
I know I should get some sleep
I'm at the beginnin of another long week
But I don't want you to go
No I don't want you to go
I guess another minute wouldn't do no harm
Why not spend it in each other's arms
Yeah I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go <start> My name was captain kidd when I sailed when I sailed
My name was captian kidd when I sailed when I sailed
And so wickedly I did
God's laws I did forbid
I roamed from sound to sound and many ships I've found
I roamed from sound to sound and many ships I've found
And that night I saw

I murdered william moore and I laid him in his gore
I murdered william moore and I laid him in his gore
And this I did to him
Amany leagues from shore
Farewell to young and old the jolly sea 
Farewell to young and old the jolly sea 
And welcome to my 
And the open  door
Farewell to london town and the pretty girls around
Farewell to london town and the pretty girls around
My friends 
In the garden can be found
Farewell for I must die I must die I must die
Farewell for I must die I must die I must die
And in my own misery I must lie I must lie
I must lie must lie must lie must lie <start> I'm falling down
I need to sleep
Come a long long way
No time for weepin
No time for weepin
Quiet now I'm falling down
I'm falling down
I have heard
A million tales
I have told
A million more
Some of them
Must have been true
But I don't know anymore
I'm falling down
Do your dance on my head
Heavy steps of the dead
Everything the snow surrounds
Falling falling falling falling
Falling falling down
I'm falling down <start> Long ol' train cruel engineer
They took my baby and left me here
And how long will I keep these lonesome blues
How long how long
Has that evening train been gone
How long how long baby how long
Mean ol' blues come down on me
They're all around me they're all I see
But how long will I keep these lonesome blues
Cruel engineer can't you see
I need my baby back with me
Then I'd be rid of these mean ol' lonesome blues <start> You turn your head each time I meet you on the street
I brush your arm as you pass by but you won't speak
I call you on the telephone but can't get through but I can't stop my loving you
Can't sleep at night can't hold you tight
Since this loneliness replaced the love we knew
I still hang around though you've turned me down for I can't stop my loving you
 steel 
So many times I've tried to find somebody new
To feel again the feeling I once felt with you
Though someone else is doing things I used to do I can't stop my loving you
Can't sleep at night... <start> Chorus
The struggle lives hard times we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain son elevate try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real
Yeah son you know its on
Now who would be the clown in the ninesix to mess around and catch a
fist
I show no mercy if you irk me
I got physical that alert me when some herb tried to jerk me
Or put the squeeze on it break down the cipher
But it won't work were tight like the QTip in the fight
Now is you insane is your brain intact
We be official when it comes to this no B.S. rap
Here comes the lyrical aerial raid right where you rest at
Now test that
I snatch your heart right through your chest black
Gettin ill thoughts when I sleep at night
I gotta maintain blot the blood stains on my brain
>From the clappin we can make it happen
Remember you ain't a killer you only rappin
I hate it rappers overexaggeratin
And never shot a gun in they life they only masterbatin
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
And wave your hands in the air and put the nines down
Chorus X
Brothas fought daily in the streets we reek havoc
On every block someones flippin like an acrobat
I'm kinda young but I still gotta hold my own
And Ima maintain what's mine till the day I'm grown
I keep my crew up people say I got a gang
But I don't smoke I don't shoot and my crew don't slang
We just hang tryin to get up in this rap game
So I can gain so fame and build my crews name
Rollin with juvenile thugs wit bad grades and bad ways
Who woulda thought that I had some AIDS
Dream totes and aspirations
Brothas are tired of being broke so maybe that's why they freebasing
Wastin time doing nothing
Livin like an outcast gotta get up get out and get something
Chorus X
Look into my eyes see if you can see what I can see
In my reality the whole world is after me
Schemin on the key but yo I got this locked down
Me and lost and found comin out the underground
Takin no prisoners my listeners we keep it real
My thoughts are militant when I'm in the killin field
Click click my minds automatic so where's the static
I got some joints up in my attic if you want to grab it
I form a cipher where my peace brothers don't sleep
You try to creep I guarantee that's when you feel the heat
I come correct in this rap game
Rappers act insane
Meanwhile I'm blowin the mic an back in the frame
They can't see me they can't feel the real G
I represent commercial rap will never kill me
Chorus X <start> I was meant to be by your side
And I have waited here a long time
For you to turn around and notice me
But now you're here holdin' hands with me
Walk me down the middle of the county fair
Walk me down the middle like you don't care
Walk me by the Ferris wheel and make sure that she sees
Let the whole world know you belong to me
I've heard about your bitter end
'Bout how she stole your heart and put it back again
Well I may not be the prettiest girl around
But I sure am a sight for sore sore eyes
Walk me down the middle of main street
Walk me down where the whole town will be
I don't need no parade but make sure that she sees
Let the whole world know you belong to me
I'd walk through fire for you
Walk through barbed wire for you
I'd walk for miles it's true
Just to be with you
If you'll walk me down the middle of my mama's church
Walk me down that aisle in your finest shirt
Let the whole world know
You will walk me down the middle of the county fair
Oh walk me down the middle like you don't care
Walk me by the Ferris wheel and make sure they all see
Let the whole world know you belong to me <start> The lights in the harbor
Don't shine for me
I'm like a lost ship
Adrift on the sea
Chorus
Sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine how I wish
You were mine again my dear
I'm on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak
Oh how did I lose you
Oh where did I fail
Why did you leave me
Always to sail
Chorus
Oh what I'd give just to sail back to shore
Back to your arms once more
Oh come to my rescue
Oh come here to me
Take me and keep me
Away from the sea
Chorus <start> Why don't you gather round me people got a song to sing
About that sweet magnolia thyme
Blackeyed Susan made some catfish stew
And papa brought some homemade wine.
All you southern children like to rock'n roll
The TV mamas tell you why
They got it on the boat from Africa
It's that Dixie Lullaby.
Well Blind Willie Time he had a dime shoe shine
Stand down on Beale Street
And Willie would stop and just to say hello
All the shoes he'd meet.
Why are you so happy said the clean white buck
You got no reason to be happy Mr Time
And Willie would stop and just pop his rag
With a Dixie Lullaby.
So now you know the story of my southern home
With a honeysuckle wine
And if you ever think that you might come yourself
You ought to keep this thought in mind.
All you easy riders better watch you step
And if you're walkin' down below the line
That Louisiana man is gonna get you yet
With his Dixie Lullaby.
He's got a Dixie Lullaby.
He's got a Dixie Lullaby.. <start> Yes I've got lots of miles but lots of memories
And I wouldn't set the miles back if I could
Cause whenever I get blue I know exactly what to do
Just retravel all those miles in memories
You say that all those miles are showing on me
Well I'll admit I had some rough ones way back when
But for every mile they hold a story left untold
Back there in my book of memories
'Cause I've got lots of miles
Now as faces and places come before me
Making up my full book of memories
And I wouldn't ever dare one page to solve up there
I might want to review them all some day
Yes I've got lots of miles <start> Chorus
Sitting on a bar stool
Acting like a dern fool
That's what I'm a doin' today
I'm sittin' here drinkin'
Tryin' to keep a thinking I'm crusin' my troubles away
Well now I couldn't make her stay
Well dog gone her anyway
She can't say that I didn't tryhihi
Poor me another one I'm finished with the other one
I'm drinkin' my baby goodbye
Every time we disagree she was always asking me
Are you a man or a mouse
Now that she's gone she probably thinks that I'm home just a moping around the house
She probably thinks that she's the one thing I just couldn't get along without
Well wouldn't this surprise her
I gotta sympathize her as long as these bottles hold out
Well I'm a
Chorus
Every time I tried to sit down and talk with her it always ended up in a fuss
I tried to reason with her right up till the time that she got on that Grayhound bus
It'd be better if I just forget if 'cause she sure forgot about me
And if it takes all night I'm gonna do it right
I'm gonna sit here till I can't see
Well I'm a
Chorus
Well I'm a
Chorus
I said to pour me another one I'm finished with the other one.
I'm drinking my baby goodbye
I said to pour me another one I'm finished with the other one.
I'm drinking my baby goodbye <start> As performed by The Singing Rambos
The things that I love and hold dear to my heart
Are just borrowed they're not mine at all
Jesus only let me use them to brighten my light
So remind me remind me dear Lord
Roll back the curtain of memory now and then
Show me where you brought me from
And where I could have been
Remember I'm human and humans forget
So remind me remind me dear Lord
Nothing good have I done to deserve God's own Son
I'm not worthy of the scars in his hands
Yet he chose the road to Calvary to die in my stead
Why he loved me I can't understand
Roll back the curtain of memory now and then
Show me where you brought me from
And where I could have been
Remember I'm human and humans forget
So remind me remind me dear Lord
So remind me remind me dear Lord <start> I bless the day I found you I want to stay around you and so I beg you let it be me
Don't take this heaven from one if you must cling to someone
Now and forever let it be me
Each time we meet love I find complete love
Without your sweet sweet love what would life be
So never leave me lonely tell me you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me
Now and forever let it be me <start> You said we met too late dear I'm nectar you are wine
But we both know sweet honey that you'll catch me down the line

It's okay my darling please don't pay it any mind
I know what you're thinking I can see your heart is kind

Oh everywhere I'm going now everything I do
It all just keeps leading me right on back to you
I met you in the springtime but you found me in the fall
but like an apple in the garden still you tempt me most of all

You say we met too late dear I'm nectar you are wine
But we both know sweet honey that you'll catch me down the line

You don't have to explain it or wish it weren't that way
just keep me in your heart dear don't ever turn away

Oh everywhere I'm going now everything I do
It all just keeps leading me right on back to you
So don't be sad my darling it's you that I adore
I'll take the love you've got for now and I'll be back for more
 <start> Little girls and little boys often cry over broken toys
But tears which fall like gentle rain wash away the hurt and pain
Little girls and little boys when they grow older change their toys
They learn that life's a hurting game but never know who's to blame
No more a child is the saddest line ever written in the sands of time
No matter how heavy the tide of tears no more can they wash away the fears
Pretty women grown off men try but can't go back again
And they're lost like all the toys they had as little girls and boys
 they had as little girls and boys <start> Record turning in your head
That you're always hummin' along to
A melody that wraps around
A rhythm there that gets a hold of you
Turn it on turn it up
Makes you feel like fallin' in love
Move me baby
Move me all night long
You move me baby
Like a song
I can hear your high heel boots
Layin' down that sweet southern groove
The way you walk the way you talk
I can't help but sing along with you
Yeah 'cause you oh
Move me baby
Move me all night long
You move me baby
Like a song yeah

Pretty Woman
I'll Stand By You
I Cross My Heart
I Will Always Love You
You Were Always On My Mind
BrownEyed Girl
I'll Walk The Line
Move me baby
Move me all night long
You move me baby
Like a song like a song
Move me baby baby
Move me all night long
Move me baby oh like a song yeah
You move so fine <start> If God is dead who's this living in my soul
He put flowers on the hills
Your cup he gladly fills
How can you turn around and say God is dead
But when your stories have all been told
There's one thing I'd like to know
If God is dead who's this living in my soul
He gives us shelter from life's stormy weather
Gives us love to keep us together
When life gets like a ship on a raging sea
And when the stage of life grows cold
Somebody helps us to play our role
If God is dead who's this living in my soul
If my soul had windows
I'd leave them open so the world could see
The ugly scars upon those hands
That bled for you and me
There's a bridge you can cross if you will
The toll was paid on Golgotha's hill
If God is dead who's this living in my soul
If God is dead who's this living in my soul <start> Girl
Waking up with you makes me feel alive.
And every kiss you give still takes me by surprise
So I thought that I would tell the world today
My life has changed so ill say
Chorus
You are not a stranger. Youre not just friend
You are not just lover who is sleeping in my bed
You are what I came for always thinking of
you are everything I wanted and love
Boy
You wash me with you eyes
You give me all your time
Someone I cant forget and I always dreamed Id find
So I thought id tell the world today
All because of you ill never be the same
Chorus Repeats
Girls
So many times I told you so
I guess I wanted you to know.
Chorus Repeats
Wanted and love <start> Oh bird of paradise
Oh bird of paradise
With your plumes of white
With your plumes of white
Did I see you turn from black to white
Did I see you turn from black to white
Take your wings in flight
Take your wings in flight
Over this earth delight
In a San Diego alley
I saw you smile
I was scared of the hunger
Til I realized it was mine <start> Once again he's left you here crying
It hurts me to see him hurt you this way
Once again here I am trying
To make the tears disappear from your face
For your sake
Let me take that heartache off your hands
You've stood more than one heart can stand
Don't give up on love 'til you give me a chance
Let me take that heartache off your hands
These shoulders were made for you to cry on
If you need them they're yours any time
These arms are yours to try on
I'll make sure they fit you just right
They'll hold you tight
Let me take that heartache off your hands
You've stood more than one heart can stand
Don't give up on love 'til you give me a chance
Let me take that heartache off your hands <start>  <start> We started out with good intentions. Makin love right there in the kitchen
You and me were getting along just fine got along just fine
More than crazy bout one another.
I was just a man and you were my lover
Glad that I was yours and you were mine
For awhile I could do no wrong.
You laughed at my jokes and you danced to the song
Not to bad for an Amarillo country boy.  country boy
I said if we could just stay together.
It could be just like this forever
Finer things in life we would enjoy
You told me you thought that I was wrong
Ya said our love wouldnt last too long
I dont want to leave you all alone
So should I stay or should I go back home
Am I right or Amarillo
Do I stay here with you or hit the road
Am I right or Amarillo
I love you but I can always go back home
Solo one A section
Now pretty soon it was just like I figured.
Ya told me that youd reconsidered
I could stay with you and be your man
be your lovin man
Now it seems theres a brand new problem.
Country boys learn their lessons when their taughtm
Ive learned about as much as I can stand
Now Im the one who thinks that I was wrong
I dont think our love is gonna last too long
I realy realy realy hate to leave you all alone
But Texs is a callin me back home
Am I right or Amarillo
Do I stay here with you or hit the road
Am I right or Amarillo
I love you but I can always go back home
Now It might be as flat as a pancake.
But how much heartache can one man take
Amarillo weve been too long apart
been too long apart
Theres no need for me to keep on talkin. If Im a goin Id better start walkin
Am I right or Amarillo never broke my heart. Nah ha <start> Don't want to go to the movies
Or spend the day in the park
I don't want no one to call me
I just want to be alone with my heart
And think of the way that you held me
The touch of your lips on my face
Surround myself in your memory
Chorus
It's just one of those days
I want to lay in my sorrow
I want to drown in my tears
Don't want to think of tomorrow
Until these thoughts disappear
Then I'll be back on my feet again
Before it's too late
As for now I want to be alone
It's just one of those days
It's just one of those days
I want to think about Texas
Driving the coast of Malibu
Wherever my minds wants to take us
I don't care long as I'm there with you
Why do I put myself through this when
Most of the time I'm okay
But here and now I can feel it
Chorus <start> Rusty barbed wire lines these fields
Gravel dust behind the wheels
Drifting like my mind into the rear view
Jet trails cutting cross the sky
I'm rolling through the open wide
Searching for a song to drink beer to
And trying to find a place to disappear to
I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do and life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for the shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked rain and smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession
Embers in the ashtray glow like memories that won't let go
I'm out here trying to get untangled
In the darkness on the edge of town
A little lost a little found
Waiting on a call from an angel
I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do and life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for the shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked rain and smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession <start> There's no wings on my angel cause she's not from heaven above
No halo on my angel but she's still the one that I love
I know that she flirts I know she's untrue
But I love her so so what can I do
There's no wings on my angel but she's still an angel to me
There's no wings on my angel the devil is there in her eyes
No gold crown on my angel she's foolin' the one with her lies
I know love is blind but still I can see
That my love for her means sweet misery
There's no wings on my angel but she's still an angel to me <start> She never was much satisfied with me
She's been a lot of time rebuilding me
A hundred times I tried to warn her
Don't back a man up in a corner
'Cause you can only push a man so far
The ties of love will only stretch so far
Then day will break and he's a goner
Don't back a man up in a corner
'Cause he'll come out swinging every time
If you'll walk up and down on his pride
If you'll break down the door and he can't hide no more
You just might find the tiger inside
It feels so good to feel the open air
It felt so good to leave her standing there
A hundred times I tried to warn her
Don't back a man up in a corner
'Cause he'll come out swinging every time
If you'll walk up and down on his pride
If you'll break down the door and he can't hide no more
You just might find the tiger inside
Don't back a man up in a corner <start> No hablo espanol
Was all I knew of the local lingo
That old pocket guide to Mexico
Wasn't much help to this out of place Gringo
When I checked into my motel room
Was helped by a browneyed senorita
She said Buen venidos Senor
Blah blah blah blah blah
Como estas Buenos das
I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it
A little voice in my head said
Boy you won't ever forget it
They say that Spanish is the language of love
Well I love the way that it rolled off her tongue
I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it
As I followed her down the hallway
I was trying my best not to stare
The angel before me was a rare beauty indeed
JayLo had nothing on her
She winked and she smiled at me sweetly
Said Senor aqui esta su mas vez
Muy guapo and something bout ho ho's
And I thought oh baby whatever you say
I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it
A little voice in my head said
Boy you won't ever forget it
They say that Spanish is the language of love
Well I love the way that it rolled off her tongue
I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it
Later that evening in a local cantina
A Mariachi band was playing
She held me close so her body would know
That my body knew what she was saying
I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it
A little voice in my head said
Boy you won't ever forget it
They say that Spanish is the language of love
Well I love the way that it rolled off her tongue
I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it
No I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it <start> Hey girl I'm just a small town run around
I get my kicks out on the outskirts of town
I could never do it like a pretty city boy
I'm more a fishin' in the dark nitty gritty boy
So lay back and let me paint you a picture
The way I wanna kiss you is
Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track
I wanna love wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night 'til the sun comes back
I wanna love wanna love wanna love you like that
When I'm with you I can see down the road girl
Not just the gravel one we're travelin' on girl
And I'm bettin' that it's gonna be a wild ride
But I promise that I'm gonna be there by your side
I think we got another memory in the makin'
So baby let's take it take it
Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track
I wanna love wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night 'til the sun comes back
I wanna love wanna love wanna love you like that
And I ain't gonna do it like a pretty city boy
I'm a fishin' in the dark nitty gritty boy yeah
So let me love you
Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track girl
I wanna love wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night 'til the sun comes back
I wanna love wanna love wanna love you like that
Baby
I wanna love wanna love wanna love you like that
Yeah
I could never do it like a pretty city boy
I'm more a fishin' in the dark nitty gritty boy <start> I've spent my life
Lookin' for you
Findin' my way
Wasn't easy to do
But I knew there was you
All the while
And it's been worth
Every mile
Chorus
So lay down beside me
Love me and hide me
And kiss all the hurtin'
Of this world away
Hold me so close
That I feel your heart beat
And don't ever wander away
Mornings and evenings
All were the same
There was no music
Till I heard your name
I knew when I saw you smile
And now I can rest for a while
Chorus
And hold me so close
That I feel your heart beat
And don't ever wander away
Love me and hide me
Till I feel your heart beat <start> I phoned her today an accidental mistake
And her name slipped out to some friend
Forgotten old feelin's brand new today'
'Cause I'm right back where I've always been
She's just an old love turned memory
And now I seldom see her around
She's just an old love turned memory
But she still turns my world upside down
I went to some places where I knew she'd be
Just to prove love was over and done
But the moment her eyes touched mine I knew
My sorrow had only begun
She's just an old love turned memory
And now I seldom see her around
She's just an old love turned memory
But she still turns my world upside down <start> I got in a little trouble at the county seat
Lord they put me in the jailhouse
For loafing on the street
Well the judge said guilty
He made his point
He said fortyfive dollars
Or thirty days in the joint
That'll be cash on the barrelhead hun
You can take your choice
You're twentyone
No money down
No credit plan
No time to chase you
'Cause I'm a busy man
I found a telephone number on a laundry slip
I had a good hardy jailor
With a six gun hip
He let me call long distance
She said Number please
And just as soon as I told her
She shouted back at me
Said that'll be cash on the barrelhead hun
Not part not half
But the entire sum
No money down
No credit line
'Cause a little boy tells me
You're the travelin' kind
Thirty days in the jailhouse
Four days on the road
I was feelin' mighty hungry
My feet a heavy load
I saw a Greyhound comin'
Stuck out my thumb
As soon as I was seated
The driver caught my arm
Said that'll be cash on the barrelhead hun
This old grey dog gets paid to run
When the engine starts
And the wheels will roll
Give me cash on the barrelhead
I take ya down the road
Ohh cash on the barrelhead
I take you down the road <start> 
When we go to glory
When our time is over
Will we stand unspoken for
When the light becomes too blinding
When my ancestors come to meet me
They'll have questions about my drugging
They may look on my enemies kindly
When my life becomes a memory
Will my ancestors meet me up there
They may look upon me
They may take it badly
All the men I used to love
All the things they won't approve of <start> 
The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone baby
The thrill is gone away
Well you know you done me wrong baby
But you'll be sorry someday
The thrill is gone
It's gone away from me
The thrill is gone
It's gone away from me
Although I'll still live on
You know so lonely I'll be
The thrill is gone
It's gone away for good
The thrill is gone baby
It's gone away for good
Some day I'll be over it all
Just like I know a good woman should
You know I'm free
Free from your spell
I'm free baby
Free from your spell
And now that it's all over
All I can do is wish you well
The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
Well you know you done me wrong baby
But you'll be sorry some day <start> Some people wish
Some people dance
Some never take a chance
Some people steal
Just for the thrill
And some drink to get their fill
But I love you
Some people preach
Some people write
And some choose to just stay quiet
Some people teach
Some people roam
Some would rather be alone
But I love you yeah
Some people hurt
Some people laugh
And some just don't know what they have
But I love you
Baby I love you yeah <start> Hello baby hello honey
Please won'tcha come back to me
I can hardly see how I write this letter
If you don't hurt home I never get better
Please won'tcha come back to me
It's been a long long time since I kissed your lips
Seems like ages since I took that trip oh I miss you so
Honey baby don't you hear me callin'
These what you see ain't raindrops fallin'
Please won'tcha come back to me
You don't know what I'm goin' through
I'm so doggone blue I'm bluer than blue
Oh I need you so <start> The only thing I really own is what you see me wearing on my back
The only friends I've ever known are the kind you meet along a railroad track
The kind you bum tobacco from and view the world through a boxcar door
A friend who talks and makes you laugh has nothing much but gives you half
And maybe you don't see him anymore
Special I hear your lonesome whistle whine
It's calling me Special keep moving me on down the line
My mackinaw is full of holes and ain't too good at keepin' out the cold
My shoes are worn as paper thin my feet can feel the cinders through the soles
Sometimes I see a pretty girl and wonder what I've missed along the way
Once someone special wore my ring and loved me more than anything
I gave her up and caught a train one day
Special I had a special girl one time
Now she's not mine Special keep moving me on down the line <start> I'm gonna raise the Titanic
Sail across the Atlantic
And this time it ain't gonna sink
I'm gonna sit here in this chair
With this beer and declare
It's the last one I'll ever drink
Buy a pair of dinosaur skin boots
Take a walk across the moon
Yeah that's what I'm gonna do
I can do that with no sweat
You can bet it's a sure bet
I'm telling the Gods honest truth
But I can't undo what I did
Or unsay what I said
Or unbreak what I broke in you
'Cause there's just a few things impossible to do
I'm gonna do some soul searching
Put my mind to working
On fixing the hurting I've done
Drop down into first gear
Jump clean into next year
By then you'll be back or still gone
Ride in on a rainbow
Land out side your window
That's what I'm gonna do <start> Headlights burn like torches on the way to a war
Tell me what it was that we were fighting for
Who is this god to which we sacrifice
I say whatever he wants we better give it to him twice
You want to help me
Give me a hand back down
'Cause I'm feeling a little rough
Around the edges now
Highway apostles take me in your arms
Living in these alleys gonna to do me some harm
I'm outside the truck stop talking in tongues
Sermons to the deaf selling salvation to the dumb
You want to help me
Give me a hand back down
'Cause I'm feeling a little rough
Around the edges now
Ten years of rolling it's been a hell of a ride
I learned that getting what you want don't leave you satisfied
Runaway eyes and bullet proof glass
Fearing the future running towards the past
Chained to the counter in some terrible town
I'd like to take you all away we'd never get off the ground
You want to help me
Give me a hand back down
'Cause I'm feeling a little rough
Around the edges now <start> . If I had listened t'what Mama said
I would not have been here today
Wishing for things I'll never have
And weeping my sweet life away.
cho If I was on some foggy mountain top
I'd sail away to the West
I'd sail all around this old wide world
To the one I love the best.
. You caused me to weep you caused me to mourn
You caused me to leave my home
Oh that lonesome pine and those good old times
I'm on my way back home.
cho....
. Oh when you see that twofaced blonde
There's somethin' you can tell 'er
She need not fool her time away
Atryin' to steal a feller.
cho....
. Oh when you come to courtin' now
Put on you navy blue
That long tail roustabout you wear
Don't do a thing for you.
cho.... <start> I don't wanna be your Monday morning heading back to work
Stuck in traffic going slow nothing on the radio
I don't wanna be another chore to check off on your list
Of things you gotta do and places that you gotta go oh no
I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I wanna set you free I wanna take you high
I wanna be wanna be your Friday night
Oh your Friday night
We can rock together let the good times roll forever
Fill up our cup make a memory drink it up
I don't wanna miss another minute wanna live it with you
Beneath the blue sky fallin' in love
I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I wanna set you free I wanna take you high
I wanna be wanna be your Friday night
Oh Friday night
I wanna be your lemonade in the shade
Money in your pocket cause you just got paid babe
I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I wanna set you free I wanna take you high
I wanna be wanna be your Friday night
Oh your Friday night
Hey your Friday night
Hey your Friday night
Your Friday night <start> Found myself some brand new friends
Took up a few bad habits again
I partied every single night this week
Late for work three days in a row
When she left she was right I know
'Cause she said I'd never amount to anything
Chorus
I'm living up to her low expectations
I'm becoming everything she said I'd be
I'm living up to her low expectations
'Cause her low expectations are high enough for me
I had to drop that night school class
Who's got the time when you're havin' a blast
The waitress here thinks I'm the cutest thing
Boss told me didn't get that raise
But what the heck That's okay
Because I never did deserve it anyway
Chorus
Yes her low expectations are high enough for me <start> Always friend
Always friend
Still some fences
We may never mend
In our time
Broken hearts
Broken lines
Every now and then
Ya spring ta mind
And we are
Always friends
Always friends
Always and forever
Thick or thin
Push it away before I let you in
And make the same mistakes twice
Dim the lights
Such is hell
Hey and such is life
And we are always friends
Always friends
Always friends
Broken hearts
Broken lines
Pray there never comes a second time
Because its such a court
Such a crime
Find the strength to leave the past behind
And we are always friends
Always friends
Always friends
Always
Push it away before I let you in
Commit the same wrongs twice
Such is hell
Hey and such is life
And we are always friends <start> Burgers and fries and cherry pies it was simple and good back then
Walkin' in the sand hand in hand never thinkin' that it could end
Makin' our love with the moon above at the drivein picture show
And it was burgers and fries and cherry pies in a world we used to know
Changes come and go we've had our share I know
Now it seems we don't have time for love anymore
Oh the things we used to say little things we did each day
Oh I long to do the things that we did before
Well it was burgers and fries...
Well I'm still the same ole me that's all I'll ever be
I'd like to think that you're the same ole you
We lost something down the line and I wish we both could find
Lord I'd like to do the things that we used to do
It was burgers and fries...
Oh it was so simple back then <start> It's  in the shade an' Mr Rose is rollin' hay.
Eighty acres down an' ten to go.
Clouds are buildin' in the south he knows time is runnin' out
An' there goes that tractor's radiator hose.
There ain't no tricks in his straw hat he walks a quarter mile back.
Miss Rose hears him slam that ol' screen door.
What he sees as wasted time is a blessing in disguise
Oh he's cussin' what she's been prayin' for.
The day turned dark as night and in her eyes he saw the light
He hadn't taken the time to notice.
From Heaven it poured down on that little old farm house
Lord knows what to do when love needs time for growin'
He sends rain for the Roses.
She pulled down the window blinds even though the sun wasn't shinin'
The rain tapped out a love song on that old tin roof.
Wrapped up in the covers they held on to each other
Like new lovers on their honeymoon.
The day turned dark as night an' in her eyes he saw the light
He hadn't taken the time to notice.
From Heaven it poured down on that little old farm house
Lord knows what to do when love needs time for growin'
He sends rain for the Roses.
Lord knows what to do when love needs time for growin'

The Lord sends rain for the Roses. <start> Before there ever came the time that I could realize
That you've meant all the world to me
You turned and I was gone to find the good life I've been missin'
But you were all the good there was in me
I went from bad to worse and back to find the good time
But it took the time like this to make me see
I searched high and low to just to find my reason
But you were all the good there ever was in me
 steel 
It's sad to think that much too late I've come to understand
That all the world was laying at my feet
I kicked aside the love that means much more than life just now
And you were all the good there was in me
I went from bad to worse...
Yes you were all the good there ever was in me <start> See that cowboy at the bar
The one at the end with all the scars
He got stomped by the meanest bronc in Santa Fe
But if he looks a little down and out
It ain't that bronc he's thinking about
It's that girl that broke his heart along the way
When a cowboy falls he falls hard
Sometimes he falls way too far
But you can bet that when he hits the ground
He'll get back up and play the part
Even with a broken heart
He'll hold the reins and hide the pain inside
Love's always a cowboy's toughest ride
Girl just listen to me now
I should know what I'm talking about
Everything I learned I learned from you
I have rode broncs from hell
And it hurt me every time I fell
But not half as much pain as you put me through
When a cowboy falls he falls hard
Sometimes he falls way too far
But you can bet that when he hits the ground
He'll get back up and play the part
Even with a broken heart
He'll hold the reins and hide the pain inside
Love's always a cowboy's toughest ride <start> Hey baby what's a nice girl like you  yeah that's what I mean
And say haven't I seen you  yeah that's what I mean
It was my first time to cheat I think she knew
And her smile just said 
I was wondering could I  yeah that's what I mean
They're playin' a slow song would you  that's what I mean
She seemed to know my each and every move
And her smile just said 
Well it's closing time could I  yeah that's what I mean
And I was wondering could I  yeah that's what I mean
She unlocked the door and gently led me through
And her smile just said 
And her smile just said  <start> Good morning sun you've been a long time shinin'
There were times I thought you'd never shine again
Goodbye rain I thought you'd never stop fallin'
But like my tears you left the day that love walked in
Hello world it's good to see that you're still turnin'
Cause yesterday I'd swear I saw you end
And heart it sure is good to feel you burnin'
Cause heart you sure were cold till love walked in
Love walked in and two hearts came together
And now that you're here by my side I know that I'll be satisfied
Forever hand in hand we'll walk together
And when we're old we'll both remember when we found each other
And we'll treasure the day that love walked in <start> The River
You know a dream is like a river sun dry or how
Ever changing as it flows
And a dreamer's just a vessel
That must follow where it goes
Trying to learn from what's behind you
And never knowing what's in store
Makes each day a constant battle
Just to stay between the shores and
I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Too many times we stand aside
And let the waters slip away
'Til what we put off 'til tomorrow
Has now become today
So don't you sit upon the shoreline
And say you're satisfied
Choose to chance the rapids
And dare to dance the tide yes
I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
There's bound to be rough waters
And I know I'll take some falls
But with the good Lord as my captain
I can make it through them all yes
I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Yes I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
'Til the river runs dry <start> 'Tis well I know that often folks keep wond'ring
When in my eyes a far off look they see
What can it be the cause of all my dreaming
What is this dream so very dear to me
And truth to tell 'tis often I go roaming
In dreams along the road of memory
To where my heart will find its consolation
Within that lovely cottage by the Lee
My home sweet home that I so fondly cherish
The dear ones there mean everything to me
In all this world if there can be a heaven
I'm sure it's in that cottage by the Lee
'Tis grand to stand outside that cottage doorway
And gaze across the corn fields so rich and gold
To hear the stream go rippling by the meadow
Or watch the shepherd calling to his fold
And down the lane that winds behind the garden
The blackbird greets the smiling summer morn
And as his music echoes o'er the valley
You smile and bless the day that you were born
Yes that's my dream my lovely dream of homeland
And though I thought a rover I could be
It's soon I found I left my heart behind me
Within that lovely cottage by the Lee <start> Another night in separate rooms
We quietly nurse our wounds
I tell myself I'd be better off on my own
I say girl just walk away
There is nothing left to say
But then I stop and think of spending my life all alone
There's a war in me
The battle lines are drawn
I'm torn between letting go and hanging on
What's right what's wrong
It's so hard to tell
There's a war in me
And war is hell
When life peeks through the curtain cracks
I look beyond the smoke and ash
I start remembering the laughter more than the tears
I say girl you can't give up
Deep down you're still in love
But then I stop and think our love has been dying for years
There's a war in me
The battle lines are drawn
I'm torn between letting go and hanging on
What's right what's wrong
It's so hard to tell
There's a war in me
And war is hell
I finally made up my mind
I pray in time I find peace
But right now in my heart as I leave
There's a war in me
The battle lines are drawn
I'm torn between letting go and hanging on
What's right what's wrong
It's so hard to tell
There's a war in me
And war is hell
There's a war in me
And war is hell <start> Stopped awhile this morning on my way back home
I had to realize this time that I'd be all alone
Cause she is moving somewhere far away not slow
And though I tried so hard to please her
She said she really had to go
Even though this time it really hurts me bad
I've been through similarities
It's not the first break I've had
And I just can't let it bring me down too low
And though I tried so hard to please her
There must be something more to know
Never thought that we would end this way
It seemed that everything was going fine
Still with all the things that I can do or say
It won't change the fate I know so well is mind
So I'll stop and look right past the pain
Cause I've been in love before and I can love again
While she is moving somewhere far away not slow
And though I tried so hard to please her
She said she really had to go <start> I heard you laughing in a crowd outside a restaurant we used to go to
I caught a glimpse that stopped me in my tracks
It took me back
You looked happy with that little girl on your shoulders happy
I know where she got those crystal eyes of blue
Time's been sweet to you
As bad as it was as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didn't get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When you're holding on to someone that you gotta let go
Someday you'll see the reason why
Sometimes yeah sometimes there's good in goodbye
I don't regret it
The time we had together
I won't forget it
But we both ended up where we belong
I guess goodbye made us strong
And yeah I'm happy
I found somebody too who makes me happy
And I knew one day I'll see you on the street
And it'd be bittersweet
As bad as it was as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didn't get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When you're holding on to someone that you gotta let go
Someday you'll see the reason why
Sometimes yeah sometimes there's good in goodbye
Yeah yeah <start> Once a day every day all day long
When I found somebody new I thought I never would
Forget you for I thought then I never could
But time has taken all the pains away until now I'm down to hurtin' once a day
Once a day all day long and once a night from dusk till dawn
The only time I wish you weren't gone is once a day every day all day long
 steel 
I'm so glad that I'm not like a boy I knew one time
He lost the girl he loved then slowly lost his mind
He sat around and cried his life away well lucky me I'm down to crying once a day
Once a day all day long...
Once a day every day all day long <start> Oh yeah sure no problem
Ill just throw away these feelings
Let go of all these hopes
And never think of you
No offense but you've lost it
If you think I'll just forget you
And decide that I don't love you
Do you realize what you're tellin' me to do
It's like sayin' don't breathe
Or don't blink
Darlin' I don't think you understand
See I can't just turn this off
It's like sayin' don't eat
Or don't sleep
Our love's just one of those things
That I've gotten used to doin' way too long
You don't have to worry
I'm not gonna stop you
You can pack up all your things
And head on out that door
But don't stand there and tell me
How you think it would be best
To leave my feelings in the past
And not allow myself to love you anymore
It's like sayin' don't breathe
Or don't blink
Darlin' I don't think you understand
See I can't just turn this off
It's like sayin' don't eat
Or don't sleep
Our love's just one of those things
That I've gotten used to doin' way too long <start> You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still
The day I met you my heart spoke to me
It said to love you through eternity
Now knowing that you were another's bride
I vowed I'll always be close by your side
You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still
You broke a heart dear that would die for you
I'd give this world dear to belong to you
The game is over now and we've both lost
A broken heart will have to pay the cost
You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still <start> She looks so pretty with no makeup on
You should hear her talkin' to her momma on phone
I love it when she raps to an Eminem song
That's my girl
Man her eyes really drive me crazy
You should see her smile when she holds a baby
I can honestly say that she saved me
My girl yeah
Yeah that's my girl
In the passenger seat windows down dancing around
Causin' a scene that's my girl
Sippin' crown and sprite in a ball cap turned back
Ooh she got me like
Yeah baby girl you gone and done it again
Makin' all the guys wish you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl
Every night before she goes to bed
She hits her knees and bows her head
Thanks the Lord for another day
I just thank him for my girl
Yeah that's my girl
In the passenger seat windows down dancing around
Causin' a scene that's my girl
Sippin' crown and sprite in a ball cap turned back
Ooh she got me like
Yeah baby girl you gone and done it again
Makin' all the guys wish you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl
Oh my girl
Yea that's my girl
In my truck in the songs that I sing with the radio up 
In my heart in my soul in the air that I breathe every day 
Yeah everything 
Yeah that's my girl
In the passenger seat windows down dancing around
Causin' a scene that's my girl
Sippin' crown and sprite in a ball cap turned back
Ooh she got me like
Yeah baby girl you gone and done it again
Makin' all the guys wish you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl
Oh my girl
Yeah that's my girl <start> If you've got a problem I don't care what it is
If you need a hand I can assure you this
I can help I've got two strong arms I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good
Let me help
It's a fact that people get lonely ain't nothing new
But a woman like you baby should never have the blues
Let me help I've got two for me let me help
It would sure do me good to do you good
Let me help
When I go to sleep at night you're always a part of my dream
Holding me tight and telling me everything I want to hear
Don't forget me baby all you gotta do is call
You know how I feel about you if I can do anything at all
Let me help if your child needs a daddy I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good let me help
When I go to sleep at night you're always a part of my dream
Holding me tight and telling me everything I want to hear
Don't forget me baby all you gotta do is call
You know how I feel about you if I can do anything at all
Let me help if your child needs a daddy I can help <start> The road ain't looked this good to me
In a couple of months or so
I've been breaking ground heading down
A hard road to hoe
I've been farming dreams but I ain't seen
No harvest in L.A.
But there's time enough to win her back
I can't waste another day
A farmer I was born and a farmer I will die
I want to plant my heels in a fertile field
And dry Rebecca's eyes
Well I couldn't work that desert dirt
And I thought my dreams were gone
But dreaming keeps on driving me
A little further on yeah a little further on
And all that time in California
It was just a waste of seed
I left everything I cared for
Neglected in the weeds
But my love for sweet Rebecca
Just keeps growing on and on
And it's time I bring the harvest home
Well I called Rebecca just last night
And I broke right down and cried
As soon as I heard her sweet voice
Across the great divide
And in my dreams the grass was green
On Sunset Boulevard
But eleven hundred miles from now
I'll wake up in her arms yeah back home on the farm
And all that time in California
It was just a waste of seed
I left everything I cared for
Neglected in the weeds
But my love for sweet Rebecca
Just keeps growing on and on
And it's time I bring the harvest home
Yeah my love for sweet Rebecca
Just keeps growing on and on
And it's time I bring the harvest home
Bring the harvest home bring the harvest home <start> You always give yourself so freely
And never ask for anything in return
Yeah you make loving you so easy
And make it so hard to know when you hurt
For everyone around you
There's not one thing you wouldn't do
I want to be that somebody for you
Chorus
When the rain starts fallin'
On your parade
And when you have to say a prayer
Just to get through another day
When there's no one there beside you
To wipe those tears from your face
Or to pull you through
I want to be
I want to be that somebody for you
Your faith and innocence renew me
Yeah you give me strength and peace of mind
No I can't hide you see right through me
You won't let me leave my dreams behind
You've always been the sun a shinin'
In my sky of blue
I want to be that somebody for you
Chorus
When the rain starts fallin'
On your parade
And when you have to say a prayer
Just to get through another day
When there's no one there beside you
To wipe those tears from your face
Or to pull you through
I want to be
I want to be that somebody for you
For everyone around you
There's not a thing I wouldn't do
You'll always be te sun a shinin'
In a sky of blue
When there's no one there beside you
To wipe the tears from your face
And pull you through
I want to be
I want to be that somebody for you <start> Right or wrong I'll always love you
Though you're gone I can't forget
Right or wrong I'll keep on dreaming
Though I wake with the same old regret
All along I knew I'd lose you
Still I prayed that you'd be true
In your heart please just remember
Right or wrong I'm still in love with you
Oh right or wrong I'll always love you
Though you're gone I can't forget
Right or wrong I'll keep on dreaming
'Til I wake with that same old regret
All along I knew I'd lose you
Still I prayed that you'd be true
And in your heart please just remember
Right or wrong I'm still in love with you <start> Moody River more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody River your muddy water
Took my baby's life
Last Saturday evening
Came to the old oak tree
It stands beside the river
Where you were to meet me
On the ground your glove I found
With a note addressed to me
It read Dear Love I've done you wrong
Now I must set you free
No longer can I live
With this hurt and this sin
I just couldn't tell you
That guy was just a friend
Moody River more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody River your muddy water
Took my baby's life
I looked into the muddy waters
And what did I see
I saw a lonely lonely face
Just looking back at me
Tears in his eyes
Ang a prayer on his lips
And the glove of his lost love
At his finger tips
Moody River more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody River your muddy water
Took my baby's life <start> Y'ALL COME

' Marson Music
When you live in the country everybody is your neighbor
On this one thing you can rely
They'll all come to see you and never ever leave you
Saying y'all come to see us by and by
Y'all come  y'all come  y'all come to see us when you can
Y'all come  y'all come  y'all come to see us now and then
Well kinfolks're comin' they're comin' by the dozen
Eatin' everything from soup to hay
And right after dinner they ain't looking any thinner
And here's what you could hear them say
Y'all come ...
Now grandma's a wishing they'd come out to the kitchen
And help her do the dishes right away
But they all start a leavin' grandma's a grievin' you can hear my grandma say
Y'all come ...
Oh y'all come to see us now and then <start> You don't want no more heartaches
I don't want no teardrops
What else is left to talk about
I ain't yours you ain't mine
Songs don't fit and words don't rhyme
Old memories keep standing in the way
You lost her I lost him
Two old hearts just won't love again
They don't need no memories hanging round
Since she's gone it don't feel right
I'm better off left alone at night
I ain't faking feeling far away
The days has just come and disappeared
You can't talk and I don't hear
It don't make no difference anyway
'Cause I lost her you lost him
Two old hearts just won't love again
I don't need no memories hanging round
'Cause I want her
And I need him
Two old fires won't burn again
They don't need no memories hanging round
No we don't need no memories hanging round <start> They say a man's home is his castle
He's like a king on a throne
It may be a shack down alongside the track
But everything in it's his own
So don't think of taking his loved one
It's written Thou shall not steal
Don't rob another man's castle
No matter how lonesome you feel
Don't rob another man's castle
Don't take his treasures away
Strange as it seems when you steal a man's dreams
You'll never know then how you'll pay
So don't rob a man of his loved one
You'll break his heart don't you see
I robbed another man's castle
Now someone just stole her from me <start> In the state of West Virginia among the peaceful rolling hills
There I met a mountain maid with eyes of blue
Golden hair so soft and curly and her lips were like the dew
She was the queen of West Virginia and her name was Linda Lou
Linda Lou my Linda Lou can't you hear me calling you
Calling like a lonesome dove my Linda Lou
When the moon is in the blue and the stars are shining too
Can't you hear my lonely heart calling for you Linda Lou
I recall the night I met her how I held her hand in mine
I recall the night we kissed and bid adieu
Many miles may separate us if I should cross the ocean blue
My heart is still in West Virginia with my darling Linda Lou <start> You can really fall
Wake up in a ruined house
Wrapped in a torn down curtain
And when I get to hell
Will the lovely girls come down
To the banks of that red red river
I can hear the laughs
When they find I've fallen down again
I can hear the laughs
And it hurts so bad I have to smile
You can take a lot
Put back not a thing
Still come home looking thinner
And when I get to Oz
Will the lovely witch come down
Kiss my pale bleeding brow
I can hear the laughs
When they find I've fallen down again
I can hear the laughs
And it hurts so bad I have to smile <start> In eighteenfourteen we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississipp'
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in the town of New Orleans
We fired our guns and the British kept a comin'
Wasn't night as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
We looked down the river and we seen the British come
And there must've been a hubdred of 'em beatin' on the drum
They stepped so high and they began to sing
We stood beside the cotton bails and didn't say a thing
We fired our gun...
Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
If we didn't fire a musket till we looked 'em in the eyes
We held our fire till we seen their faces well
Then we opened up our aquirrel guns and really gave 'em hell
We fired our guns...
Yeah they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico <start> I didn't even bother to set the alarm
If I'm a few hours late what's the harm
I've been in Mexico I've been in Mexico
I've discovered how to take it slow
I've been in Mexico
The boss stressed out so many deadlines to meet
I'm leanin back in my chair with my two bare feet
I've been in Mexico I've been in Mexico
Still got the sun on my back and then sand in my toes

When I landed in the land of the Aztec sun
I was too uptight and too high stung
But the moment that salt air hit my tongue I felt a change
Nobody ever goes and comes back the same
When she left me for another I was down and out
But there's a little cactus cure I've learned about
I've been to Mexico I've been to Mexico
 <start> Somewhere in my thoughts there lives a lady
She's walking back and forth across my mind
Blocking out each chance of me forgetting
Assuring me she'll be there for some time
Her golden hair is tied around my memory
The pain she left with me is here to stay
I'm doing all I can to go on living
And yet I die a little more each day
Lead Break
Now that I'm alone with just my memory
I've had some time for counting my mistakes
And loving her stands out from all the others
But that was one I couldn't help but make
Funny how some thoughts can be so painful
And how refuse to go away
I'm doing all I can to go on living
And still I die a little more each day
She lets me die a little more each day <start> Nine pound hammer is just a little too heavy
For my size baby for my size
Take this hammer show it to my captain
Tell him I'm gone baby tell him I'm
If he asks you where I went to
Tell him you don't know baby you don't know
Ain't no hammer in this mountain
Out rings mine baby out rings mine
Take this hammer and throw it in the river
It rings right on baby it rings right on
This is the hammer that killed John Henry
But it won't kill me baby it won't kill me
This old hammer killed my buddy
It laid him low it laid him low
Roll on buddy don't roll so slow
How can I roll when the wheels won't go
Roll on buddy for to make your time
I broke down and I can't make mine
This nine pound hammer just a little too heavy
For my size baby for my size <start> Starting to want you when I don't want to
Lately I find you on my mind
Comin' on slowly signs all show me
Something is growing as time goes by
Well you think about me when you're not with me
Beginning to miss me when you're alone
Ever so gently you find you want me
And it's getting stronger all along
We're taking our time it's the slow kind
But we don't mind 'cause there's no hurry
'Cause it's a sure thing that were falling slowly but surely
I don't want to rush you by saying 'I love you'
We'll let it happen on its own
And when it does love one thing I'm sure of
It's gonna last us from now on
We're taking our time it's the slow kind
But we don't mind 'cause there's no hurry
'Cause it's a sure thing that were falling slowly but surely
We're taking our time it's the slow kind
But we don't mind 'cause there's no hurry
'Cause it's a sure thing that were falling slowly but surely <start> I said a bad word when I was a kid
Mama said that I'd be sorry for the sin that I did
My daddy whooped me and the preacher said shame
And I tried like hell to change
I cuss I smoke
I laugh at dirty jokes
Minor vices man I know 'em well
I've closed down bars
And I've busted in my heart
My exes think I oughta burn in hell
But the devil he won't notice when I die
Don't you figure
He's got bigger fish to fry
Oh yeah
Politicians taking corporate bribes
Crooked CEOs are getting off with no time
Christmas eve burglars stealin' good children's toys

Holiday burglars stealin' good children's toys
I cuss I smoke
I laugh at dirty jokes
The minor vices man I know I'm well
I've closed down bars
I've busted in my heart
My exes thinks that I oughta burn in hell
But the devil wont even notice when I die
Ya don't you figure
Hes got bigger fish to fry
There's gonna be a bonfire burnin'
An everlastin' barbeque
But with all the bad stuff goin' on
There ain't gonna be room for me and you
'Cause we cuss and we smoke
We laugh at Taylor's jokes

Some minor vices man we know 'em well
We've closed down bars and we've busted in our hearts
Our exes think we oughta burn in hell
But the devil he wont notice when we die
Don't you figure he's got bigger fish to fry
Ya don't you figure
He's got bigger fish to fry

 <start> Christmas time's a comin' Christmas time's a comin'
Christmas time's a comin' and I know I'm going home
Snowflakes are falling my old home's a calling
Tall pines are humming Christmas time's a coming
Can't you hear them bells ringing ringing joy joy hear them singing
When it's snowing I'll be going back to my country home
Christmas time's a comin' Christmas time's a comin'
Christmas time's a comin' and I know I'm going home
Holly's in the window home's where the wind blows
Can't walk for running Christmas time's a comin'
Can't you hear them bells ringing ringing joy joy hear them singing
When it's snowing I'll be going back to my country home
Christmas time's a comin' Christmas time's a comin'
Christmas time's a comin' and I know I'm going home
White candles burning my old heart's a yearning
For the folks at home when Christmas time's a coming
Can't you hear them bells ringing ringing joy joy hear them singing
When it's snowing I'll be going back to my country home
Christmas time's a comin' Christmas time's a comin'
Christmas time's a comin' and I know I'm going home <start> You have heard and read about the state of Tennessee
Down in the southern states is where I wanna be
Where the valleys are so green and mountains are so tall
You will know just what I mean when you hear them say You all
Tennessee

I hear you callin' me

The home of Davy Crockett in the hills of Tennessee
When I was a little boy around the folks at home
My mama always said to me Jimmy please don't roam
Now that I have straight away my heart is full of woe
When I think of Mom and Dad that's where I wanna go
Tennessee

I hear you callin' me

The home of Davy Crockett in the hills of Tennessee
If ever I get back to that state of Tennessee
I tell you there'll be no more roamin' for me
There lives a sweetheart who said She'd marry me
As soon as I get back to that state of Tennessee
Tennessee

I hear you calling me

The home of Davy Crockett in the hills of Tennessee <start> I just heard the song we fell in love to
And my heart began to smile the way it smiles
Each time I hear the song we fell in love to
It's a message from the past that our love will always last
Whenever I'm feelin' down that song comes hangin' 'round
And picks me up with happy memories
As time goes by more and more I love you
And our friend that tags along that song we fell in love to
And when I hear the song we fell in love to
All the memories that we've made are suddenly replayed
Each time I hear that melody it thrills me
For it makes me think of you that song we fell in love to <start> She still sits out on the range
Sun sets she looks like a rose in the rain
Waiting and praying he's coming again
He rode like the breath of Nero
A real man  laid down his life for a friend
Fought for her life to the bitter end
And she won't care how long or where or when
She still believes he's coming 'round the bend
Until the last real cowboy rides again
She's saving all her sun sets until then love never ends
Six years since he's been gone
Some say they heard her calling her name
Dancing with him through the window pane
It can't be she must be crazy
Must be that she's got a heart that won't mend
But I think she visits him in the wind
When a cool breeze is rushing through her hair
There's one hand on her heart
The other she's waving in the air <start> In the world's mighty gallery of pictures hang the scenes that're painted from life
There hang pictures of love and of passion and there's pictures of sorrow and strife
There hang pictures of youth and of beauty of old age and a blushing young bride
But the saddest of all that hang on the wall are the pictures from life's other side
Just a picture from life's other side someone has fell by the way
A life has gone out with the tide that might have been happy some day
There's a poor old mother at home who's watching and waiting alone
Just longing to hear from a loved one so dear it's a picture from life's other side
Now the first scene is that of a gambler who's lost all his money at play
And he reaches down and takes his dead mother's ring from her finger
The one that she wore long ago on her wedding day
It's his last earthly treasure but he stakes it
Then bows his head that his shame he might hide
When they lifted his head they found he was dead
It's just a picture from life's other side
Now the last scene is that by the river of a heartbroken mother and babe
As the harbor lights shine and they shiver on an outcast whom that no one can save
And yet she was once a true woman she was somebody's darling and pride
God help her she leaps for there's no one to weep it's a picture from life's other side <start> Since I saw that rodeo in 
I had to try to be the greatest bareback rider alive
I went and did some practicing on pa's old ropin' mare
And I thought I'd take that bronc I'd drawed
And really part it's hair
When they opened up the gate he did a double flip
Half way through the second one is when I lost my grip
I hooked my spurs into the dees and hung with all my might
I held my breath he chinned the moon
And sucked back to the right
My boots came off and went asailin' right up in the stands
My belt it broke and shattered my watch I lost my wedding band
I scattered all my cigarettes my shirt ripped down the back.
I sure was gettin' dizzy and I thought my neck would crack
I rode him several jumps with both hands high up in the air
He jumped into an old light pole we parted company there
I landed in some muddy slop he stomped right through my side
I knew he busted all my ribs and made me wanna die
Nothin' ever busted me like that old pony ride
I couldn't seem to catch my breath I couldn't seem to hide
I hobbled back barefooted just a searchin' for my pride
And I just couldn't believe my achin' ears
When the announcer said RERIDE RERIDE RERIDE
I've had enough for  men and he calls up RERIDE
RERIDE RERIDE
You'd think he got me good enough they give him one more try <start> Those crazy Christians I was gonna sleep in today
But the church bells woke me up and they're a half a mile away
Those crazy Christians dressed up drivin' down my street
Get their weekly dose of guilt before they head to Applebee's
They pray before they eat and they pray before they snore
They pray before a football game and every time they score
Every untimely passing every dear departed soul
Is just another good excuse to bake a casserole
Those crazy Christians go and jump on some airplane
And fly to Africa or Haiti risk their lives in Jesus' name
No they ain't the late night party kind
They curse the devil's whisky while they drink the Savior's wine
A famous TV preacher has a big affair and then
One tearful confession and he's born again again
Someone yells hallelujah and they shout and clap and sing
It's like they can't wait to forgive someone for just about anything
Those crazy Christians
Instead of being outside on this sunny afternoon
They're by the bedside of a stranger in a cold hospital room
And every now and then they meet a poor lost soul like me
Who's not quite sure just who or what or how he ought to be
They march him down the aisle and then the next thing that you know
They dunk him in the water and here comes another one of those crazy Christians
They look to heaven their whole life
And I think what if they're wrong but what if they're right
You know it's funny much as I'm baffled by it all
If I ever really needed help well you know who I'd call
Is those crazy Christians <start> Don't you waste anytime with those bags under your eyes
Put you bag in your hand and run with me
Just to know you're this close
Darlin' I nearly choke
Can't you see you can have all my tomorrows
Come on Miss K wrap your lovin' arms around me
Talk dirty turn me on let's get goin'
Well we're young and we're brave
So turn your back and walk away
Turn your back to the past and take off fast
Just to dance in your arms it's like I can't fall apart
So take a chance change your stance and see what happens
Come on Miss K wrap your drunken arms around me
Talk dirty turn me on let's get goin'
Well our lives are ever changing
Some shit always hits the fan
Oh but when we first locked eyes
Well Miss K you took me by surprise
Don't you waste anytime with those bags under your eyes
Put you bag in your hand and roll with me
Just to know you're this close
Darlin' I nearly choke
So can't you see you can have all my tomorrows
Come on Miss K wrap your lovin' arms around me
Talk dirty turn me on let's get goin'
Come on Miss K wrap your lovin' arms around me
Talk dirty turn me on let's get goin'
Let's get goin'
Get goin'
Goin'
Hey where we goin'
Let's just go
Keep movin' baby <start> They're about to turn the lights out
The car just gave out there goes this month's check
Seems like everything we own is either falling down or standing up on it's last leg
Somehow like before we'll find a way to make ends meet
Beat the wolves off the door and get back on our feet
Cause we've ridden out some bad ones just by holdin' on
To the one thing we knew would still be standing strong
Our love will be here long after the storm is gone
We were about to lose the light house
Getting tossed about on a sea of debt
Seems like every time we bailed the boat we'd spring a leak
But patch it up before we got wet
With one eye always looking out to find a better wind
We've drifted out but somehow always drifted back again
Chorus
And we've ridden out some bad ones just by holdin' on
To the one thing we knew would still be standing strong
Our love will be here long after the storm is gone <start> You ask me not to wear cologne
Shell know youve been with me alone
And you cant take our secret home
So you ask me not to wear cologne
You can wipe the make up off
The lipstick or a little gloss
But fragrance lingers on and on
So you ask me not to wear cologne
You leave my bed and go to hers
Leaving me alone and hurt
I love you whether right or wrong
And you ask me not to wear cologne
Im not out to hurt someone
Not you not her not any one
But I got heartaches of my own
Why I cant even wear cologne
Oh but I never meant for this to be
It wasnt in my heart to cheat
Love has a nature all it's own
So I willingly gave up cologne
And every time you come to me
I realize Im in too deep
I know you love us both and I keep holding on
You ask me not to wear cologne
You say Dont wear cologne
Oh now what am I ever gonna do
Cause I am so in love with you
I know you love us both
But where do I belong
You ask me not to wear cologne
You ask me not to wear cologne
Shell know youve been with me alone
And you cant take our secret home
So you ask me not to wear cologne
How do I walk away from the greatest love Ive known
You ask me not to wear cologne
Oh you ask me not to wear cologne
You ask me not to wear cologne
Shell know youve been with me alone
And Im a scent you cant take home
But will I ever get to wear cologne <start> I just came in here tonight to get somebody off my mind
I just want to be alone my heartache and my wine
So if it's all the same to you my friend just be on your way
I can see you've got problems but I've had my share today
I'd be glad to help you out just show me which way you came in
I've got troubles of my own in fact my world just fell in
Your sad tellin' has touched but go tell it to a friend
I'd be glad to help you out just show me which way you came in
 steel 
Now don't think that I'm so unconcerned about your happiness
You need someone to talk to it help one to confess
But your problems are so simple when you lay them next to mine
So just mosey on now Mister you're just taking off my time
I'd be glad to help you out...
I'd be so glad to help you out just show me which way you came in <start> You left me for the bright lights of the town
A country boy set out to see the world
Remember when those neon lights shine down
That big old moon shines on your Kentucky girl
I swear I love you by the moon above you
How bright is it shining in your world
Some morning when you wake up all alone
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl
Don't wait to bring great riches home to me
I need no diamond rings or fancy pearls
Just bring yourself you're all I'll ever need
That's good enough for this blue Kentucky girl
I swear I love you by the moon above you
How bright is it shining in your world
Some morning when you wake up all alone
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl <start> Loud couple
Drinking doubles
In a tussle
Angry mumbles
He slowly stumble
Into a tumble
Bouncer flexes muscles
While taking off his muzzle
Lost in a puzzle...
Lost in a puzzle...
Late night sunday
Sad girl sassy
Lazy dressy Bessy
Makeup messy
Listens to Elvis Presley
With tissues ready
Squeezin' on her teddy
Ain't nobody's baby
Lost in a puzzle...
Lost in a puzzle... <start> Walking on the velvet dream
Meadow clothed in mazed
To the Holy ground of love
Where two children met and kiss
Thru the window of my dreams
Floating from the past
I'm no willing prisoner of the
Gentle spell of Love you cast
Centuries come and go
All is change and turn
Maybe only god will know
But forever my Love will burn
Or the hills of passing time
Runs a golden track
Love will always Rule my heart
My heart will always rule my head
Centuries come and go
All is change and turn
Maybe only god will know
But forever my Love will burn
MUSIC
The spirit of what's done still lives
In my beaten brain
Time and time may dim my eyes
But they'll never lay my love to rest
Centuries come and go
All is change and turn
Maybe only god will know
But forever my Love will burn
Centuries come and go
All is change and turn
Maybe only god will know
But forever my Love will burn
Forever my love will burn
MUSIC
Centuries Centuries Centuries Centuries. <start> Please release me let me go I don't love you anymore
To live together is a sin release and let me love again
I have found a new love dear and I'll always want her near
Her lips are warm while yours are cold release me my darling let me go
 guitar 
Oh please release me let me... <start> It's too late
You say you want me and it's too late
Once my love for you was so great
But it's too late to love me now
It's too bad
You say you need me and it's too bad
I know the feelin' and it's so sad
But it's too late to love me now
It's too late to love me now
Don't you know how hard I tried
To hold out just for you
Lovin' you from mem'ry day by day
Then someone came into my life
Turned my dreams around
He's takin' all the love you threw away
It's too late
You say you want me and it's too late
Once my love for you was so great
But it's too late to love me now
It's too late to love me now
Don't you know how hard I tried
To hold out just for you
Lovin' you from mem'ry day by day
Then someone came into my life
Turned my world around
He's takin' all the love you threw away
It's too late
You say you need me and it's too late
Once my love for you was so great
But it's too late to love me now
It's too late to love me now <start> Others have touched me soft in the night
And others have kissed me and held me tight
Good times and lovers I've had a few
But I was just waiting for someone like you.
Others have loved me before your time
Some who were gentle some who were kind
Don't it seem funny I never knew
I was just waiting for someone like you.
No I never wasted a minute of my time
'Cause every road I ever took led me to your side
I've been lonely and I have been loved
I got used to losin' what I'm fondest of.
But it's all so clear now my whole life through
I was just waiting for someone like you <start> I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart
And as the door of love between us closes
Tears will fall like petals when we part
I begged you to be different but you'll always be untrue
I'm tired of forgivin' now there's nothin' left to do
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart
I know that I should hate you after all you've put me through
But how can I be bitter when I'm still in love with you <start> No no no I don't want to love you
And oh oh oh I'm tryin' not to
No no no I don't want to love you
But oh oh oh I think I do
This heart of mine it's been mistreated
Love's done me wrong time and again
After the way I've been cheated
I want you and yet I still can't forget
I'm so afraid to give in
I think about you every minute
And I miss you when you're not around
And every day I'm getting' deeper in it
I'm scared to go on but the feelin's so strong
I can't turn away from you now
No no no I don't want to love you
And oh oh oh I'm tryin' not to
No no no I don't want to love you
But oh oh oh I think I do <start> He was a tall man
Raised up from the fields out pickin' cotton
In a hard land where the ground was poor and the wood was rotten
But when he saw her
All those bad times were forgotten
And he believed he believed
She was the strong hand
A good sister and a daughter
Lookin' for one man
To love the way that her mama'd taught her
And when she saw him
She thanked God for what he'd brought her she believed she believed
And it's a miracle
How one soul finds another
Just one miracle
Is all it took my brother
For I have seen them
As they walk this world together
And I believe I believe
It's a sad thing
When one must leave the other
And fly up where the voice rings
Out with all the multitudes that gather
But for a short while
Down here no song ever sounded sweeter
And we believed we believed
For it's a miracle
How one soul finds another
Just one miracle
Is all it took my brother
And I will see them
Someday they'll walk again together
I believe I believe
This I believe I believe <start> I was born in Saginaw Michigan I grew up in a house on Saginaw bay
My dad was a poor hard working Saginaw fisherman
Too many times he came home with too little pay
I loved a girl in Saginaw Michigan the daughter of a wealthy wealthy man
But he called me that son of a Saginaw fisherman
And said I wasn't good enough for his daughter's hand
That's why I went up to Alaska searchin' around for gold
Like a crazy fool I was diggin' in the frozen ground so cold
But with each new day I pray I'd strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw Michigan
I wrote my love in Saginaw Michigan I said honey I'm comin' home please wait for me
And you can tell your dad I'm coming back a richer man
I've hit the biggest strike in Klondike history
So her dad met me in Saginaw Michigan
He gave me a great big party and we served champagne
Then he said son now you're a wise young ambitious man
Now won't you sell your fatherinlaw your Klondike claim
So now he's up there in Alaska diggin' in the cold cold ground
Why the greedy fool is lookin' for the gold I never found
It serves him right and no one here is a missin' him
Least of all the newly weds of Saginaw Michigan
Least of all us newly weds of Saginaw Michigan  <start> I'm a believer
There's a song in me that's begging to be heard.
Yes I'm a dreamer
Hanging on to hope for everything it's worth
So I skipped a few meals and I slept in my car
When you're down that road
They don't care who you are
Oh look at me now
I'm still here standing strong
Giving it my all
'Cause that's just who I am
I won't give up
I don't know what that means
It's not inside of me. <start> Sometimes Lord it feels like
The cards'll never fall my way.
And it seems like I spend a lot of time
Just waitin' for my luck to change.
But I can see the end in the distance up ahead.
An' though I'm not there yet I keep on going.
'Cause I made up my mind somehow I will survive
One a step at a time.
I know I'm gonna find a place
To rest this weary soul
Leave all the heartaches and tears behind
An' get off this lonesome road.
So I'll be walkin' with tunnel vision
To keep my mind off lookin' back.
'Cause fallin' for the wrong one
Is what led me down this path.
But my day is comin' soon mountains are in my rear view.
Already made it through the hardest part.
Nothin's gonna slow me down till I reach that sacred ground
Won't be too long now.
I know I'm gonna find a place
To rest this weary soul
Leave all the heartaches and tears behind
An' get off this lonesome road.
Instrumental break.
Someday I'll lay down those memories.
Feel the sun on my face and the freedom under my feet.
I know I'm gonna find a place
To rest this weary soul
Leave all the heartaches and tears behind
An' get off this lonesome road.
Get off this lonesome road. <start> I Can't Believe That You've Stopped Loving Me
Tomorrow I'll say Happy Birthday darling
And surprise you with a gift when I come home
Then my forgetful arms will reach out for you
I can't forget you just because you're gone
Chorus
I can't believe that you stopped loving me
It's too much for me to understand
How can anything so real become a dream
I can't believe that you've stopped loving me
I sifted all the reasons why you left me
And I've gone back and relived all the love we had
For every tear we lost I found a thousand smiles
And the good times always outweighed the bad
Chorus
I can't believe that you stopped loving me
It's too much for me to understand
How can anything so real become a dream
I can't believe that you've stopped loving me
I can't believe that you've stopped loving me <start> They say that it's a matter of trusting
Before love has a chance to begin
And it's never simple
Faithless hearts can cripple
And only a strong love survives
I know they say that it's a fine line
Between giving up and giving in
But once your heart's been in it
You just can't forget it
It's like nothing that you've felt in your life
Chorus
We got real love
Not infatuation
Real love
Our hearts' celebration
I love you
Real love
Not an imitation
Real love
You're my destination
Baby you and me
We got everything we need
You are such a part of my life
That I can't remember me without you
And we've had our nights
We've had our share of fights
But we've never thought of giving it up
Oh you and I we must be dreamers
'Cause we're making our dreams come true
I could spend my life
Just holding you so tight
And never ever get enough
Chorus
We got real love
Repeat Chorus <start> Mental cruelty that's what I heard her say
Mental cruelty to the judge that day
I sat there in silence so she could be free
And listened to her lying words mental cruelty
Your Honor since our marriage my life's not been the same
Why I'm missing out on all the fun and he's the one to blame
There's never any excitement now the way there used to be
And sharing his way of life is mental cruelty
Mental cruelty that's what I heard her say
Mental cruelty to the judge that day
I sat there in silence so she could be free
And listened to her lying words mental cruelty
Divorces have been granted for many different things
Even when there's not a reason and no one can be blamed
With only two little words she's on her merry way
Yes all a woman has to claim is mental cruelty
Mental cruelty that's what I heard her say
Mental cruelty to the judge that day
I sat there in silence so she could be free
And listened to her lying words mental cruelty <start> Where do I start lying on a blanket underneath the stars
With your head on my chest
I always liked that best
I hate how time flies
I still think back sometimes
'Bout your lips on my neck
I always liked that best
That time we took a ride
Ended up down by the riverside
Soft touch wet kiss
I always liked that best
I like the way you used to hold me
I like the way you came to know me
Ya came to know me well well well
Falling to sleep
Wearing your shirt 'cause it smelled so sweet
Who could forget
I always liked that best
Or loosing my heart
Everytime ya sing to me on your guitar
Lady in Red
I always liked that best
I like the way you used to hold me
I like the way you came to know me
Ya came to know me well well well
I could go on
So many things I miss now that you're gone
Your love oh yes
I always liked that best <start> Girl you look so pretty in your wedding day white
Dancing with another man but that's alright
The way he's spinning you around has stopped the whole room
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots
He's got a heart of gold right hand like a vice
Same man on Sunday morning as Saturday night
Barbed wire tough and cowboy cool
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots
He was the first to hold your hand the first to dry your tears
We had a man to man and now I'm taking it from here
I made him a promise girl I promise you
I'll always do the best that I can do
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots
They say there's things about him that you see in me
He's the kind of man I want to be
Got to give the man credit where credit is due
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots
He was the first to hold your hand the first to dry your tears
We had a man to man and now I'm taking it from here
I made him a promise and girl I promise you
I'll always do the best that I can do
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots
Girl you look so pretty in your wedding day white
Dancing with another man oh but that's alright
The way he's spinning you around has stopped the whole room
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots <start> Well show me your wounds
I'll show you my scars
We'll compare our broken hearts
I know what you've been through
I've been hurt just like you
Love makes you sad it makes you cry
You've had tears and so have I
Don't give up on love yet
We might just have one chance left
Cause we've been used we've been hurt
We've had so many lovers
But had we known love won't work
We'd never tried it with each other
So get it off off of your chest
I know how it feels myself
It's good for me and you
To have someone to talk to
And maybe who knows maybe in time
You and I might change our minds
Something tells me somehow
This time love just might work out
Cause we've been used we've been hurt
We've had so many lovers
But had we known love won't work
We'd never tried it with each other
Well we've been used we've been hurt
We've had so many lovers
But had we known love won't work
We'd never tried it with each other <start> When you're all alone and blue
No one to tell your troubles to
Remember me I'm the one who loves you
And when this old world turned you down
Not a true friend can be found
Remember me I'm the one who loves you
And through all kinds of weather
You'll find I'll never change
Through the sunshine and the shadows
I'll always be the same
We're together right or wrong
Where you go I'll tag along
Remember me I'm the one who loves you <start> My oh my you're so goodlooking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking
Do you pour a little something on the rocks
Slide down the hallway in your socks
When you undress do you leave a path
Then sink to your nose in a bubble bath
My oh my you're so goodlooking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
Do you break things when you get mad
Eat a box of chocolates 'cause you're feelin' bad
Do you paint your toes 'cause you bite your nails
Call up momma when all else fails
Who are you when I'm not around
When the door is locked and the shades are down
Do you listen to your music quietly
And when it feels just right are you thinkin' of me
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
My oh my you're so goodlooking
But who are you when I'm not looking <start> Oh play me a blue song
fade down the light
I'm sad as a proud man can be sad tonight
Just let me dream on oh just let me sway
While the sweet violins and the saxophones play
and miss you don't know me but can't we pretend
that we care for each other till the band reach the end
Oh one step for aching
two steps for breakin'
Waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love
one step for sighing
two steps for crying
waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love
Oh they say love's for gamblin'
the pendulum swings
I bet out on love and I lost everything
but don't send me home now
put a shot in my arm
and we'll drink out old memories and we'll drink until dawn.
and Mr. Band leader wont you play one more time
for I've got folding money in this pocket of mine
Oh one step for aching
two steps for breakin'
Waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love
one step for sighing
two steps for crying
waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love
and miss you don't know me but can't we pretend
that we care for each other till the band reach the end
Oh one step for aching
two steps for breakin'
Waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love
one step for sighing
two steps for crying
waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love
Oh Waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love <start> I didn't have to turn my head whenever you walked in
The only one to let these chills roll down my skin
My heart beats faster when I hear your name
And I feel my confidence slipping away
Thought I was doing fine
About to get you off my mind
I see your face and then I'm wrapped
Around your pretty little finger again
It feels like ages since you laid down in my arms
See no good reason I'm tangled in your charm
My God your smiling and you catch my eye
Well my heart is pounding deep inside
Thought I was doing fine
About to get you off my mind
And I see your face and then I'm wrapped
Around your pretty little finger again
Ain't gonna let no man go down without a fight
Cause my stones and walls look better in the bright daylight
My heart beats faster I call your name
And I feel my confidence slipping away
Oh thought I was doing fine
About to get you off my mind
And I see your face and then I'm wrapped
Around your pretty little finger again
Your finger again <start> In the shadows of our bedroom I hold you in the darkness tenderly
While there's another woman who's waitin' in a room alone for me
By now I'll bet she's restless she's already poured the wine and dimmed the lights
But I'm here at home beside you and look who I'm cheatin' on tonight
I guess that I'd forgotten the warm willing woman you can be
And I guess that I'd forgotten the gentle way you feel next to me
It's strange to be here with you the one I've cheated on so many times
But your body's warm beside me look who I'm cheatin' on tonight
So I lie here in the shadows and watch the rise and fall of your breast
The blush is still on your face love makes a woman look that way I guess
By now I'll bet she's worried she'll pour herself another glass of wine
Lord knows I've done some cheatin' but look who I'm cheatin' on tonight
I guess that I'd forgotten
Lord knows I've done some cheatin' but look who I'm cheatin' on tonight <start> Blues stay away from me
Blues why don't you let me be
Don't know why
You keep on haunting me
Love was never meant for me
True love was never meant for me
It seems somehow
We never can agree
How 'bout you Joe
Blues stay away from me
Blues why don't you let me be
Don't know why
You keep on haunting me
Life is full of misery
Tears so many I can't see
Seems somehow
I never can be free <start> Call me a dog when I'm gone gone gone
You call me a dog when I'm gone
But when I get back with a ten dollar bill
It's Honey where you been so long
Been all around old Kentucky and
The state of old Tennessee
And every place where I hang my hat
Is home sweet home to me
Daddy told me how to gamble
He taught me to play that jack and trey
Every time that the deal would go down
I'd look down on that deuce ace and trey
Old black dog when I'm gone gone gone
You call me a dog when I'm gone
But when I get back with a ten dollar bill
It's Honey where you been so long
Whose gonna shoe your pretty little feet
Whose gonna glove your hand
Whose gonna kiss your rosy little cheeks
Tell me whose gonna be your man
Daddy will shoe my pretty little feet
Momma will glove my hand
Sister will kiss my rosy little cheeks
And I ain't gonna need a gambling man
Old black dog when I'm gone gone gone
You call me a dog when I'm gone
But when I get back with a ten dollar bill
It's Honey where you been so long <start> I was on the outskirts of a little southern town
Trying to reach my destination before the sun went down
The old CB was blarin' away on Channel 
When there came a little boy's voice on the radio line
And he said Breaker  is anyone there
Come on back truckers and talk to Teddy Bear
I keyed the mike and I said You got it Teddy Bear
And the little boy's voice came back on the air
Appreciate the breaker who we got on that end
I told him my handle and then he began
Though I'm not supposed to bother you fellows out there
Mom says you're busy and for me to stay off the air
But you see I get lonely and it helps to talk
'Cause that's about all I can do I'm crippled and I can't walk
I came back and told him to fire up that mike
And I'd talk to him as long as he'd liked
This was my dad's radio the little boy said
But I guess it's mine and mom's now 'cause my daddy's dead
Dad had a wreck about a month ago
He was tryin' to get home in a blinding snow
Mom has to work now to make ends meet
And I'm not much help with my two crippled feet
She says not to worry that we'll make it alright
But I hear her cryin' sometimes late at night
You know there's one thing I want more than anything else to see
Oh I know you guys are too busy to bother with me
But you see my dad used to take me for rides when he was home
But I guess that's all over now since my daddy's gone
Not one breaker came on the old CB
As that little crippled boy talked with me
I tried hard to swallow a lump just wouldn't stay down
As I thought about my boy back in Greenville town
Dad was gonna take mom and me with him later on this year
Why I remember him sayin' someday
This old truck will be yours Teddy Bear
But I know now I'll never get a ride on wheeler again
But this old base'll keep me in touch with all my trucker friends
Teddy Bear's gonna back on out now and leave you alone
Cause it's about time for mom to come home
But you give me shout when you're passin' through
And I'll surely be happy to come back to you
Well I came back and I said before you go 
What's your home twenty little CB friend
He gave me his address and I didn't once hesitate
Cause this hot load of freight would just have to wait
I turned that truck around on a dime
And headed straight for Jackson Street two two nine
And as I rounded the corner oh I got one the heck of a shock
Eighteenwheeler were lined up for three city blocks
I guess every driver for miles around had caught Teddy Bear's call
And that little crippled boy was havin' a ball
For as fast as one driver would carry him in
Another would carry him to his truck and take off again
Well you better believe I took my turn rifin' Teddy Bear
And then carried him back in and put him down in his chair
And buddy if I never live to see happiness again
I want you to know I saw it that day in the face of that little man
We took up a collection for him before his mama got home
And each driver said goodbye and then they were all gone
He shook my hand with a mile long grin
And said So long trucker I'll catch you again
Ah I hit that interstate with tears in my eyes
I turned on the radio and I got another surprise
Breaker  came the voice on the air
Just one word of thanks from mama Teddy Bear
We wish each and everyone a special prayer for you
Cause you just made my little boy's dream come true
I'll sign off now before I start to cry
May God ride with you  and goodbye <start> Y' tell me you don't love me
Well I don't love you
You say you don't want me
Well I don't want you
You tell me there are other
Fish in the sea
And another gathers
Roses for me
On this we will agree
You do what you want
And I will do what I want
I'm now free of master and everyone
Servant of all and servant to none
And constancy and love is a joke
I'm not afraid of meeting you
I'm fickle and I brag about it
Neither will I cry for you
Like a bird freed from his cage
All night and all day I'll play and sing
And you do what you want
And I will do what I want
I'm now free of master and everyone
Servant of all and servant to none <start> Well it's Christmastime pretty baby
And the snow is on the ground
It's Christmastime pretty baby
And the snow is on the ground
Said you better be good now baby
'Cause Santa Claus is back in town
I got no sleigh with reindeer
Got no toys on my back
You're gonna see me coming
In a big black Cadillac
It's Christmas time pretty baby
And the snow is on the ground
Said you better be good now baby
'Cause Santa Claus is back in town
Hang up your pretty stockings
Turn out the lights
Santa Claus is comin' down
Your chimney tonight
It's Christmastime pretty baby
And the snow is on the ground
Said you better be good now baby
'Cause ol' Saint Nick is back in town <start> I've been a waiter a roofer a clerk
I've shoveled manure till my pride hurt.
When you're starting out it's all part of the work
To do what I do.
I've been evicted for not making rent
Made my Daddy wonder where my good sense went.
For the price of a dream my years have been spent
To do what I do.
So I stand here tonight with this six string guitar
To be something I've always been in my heart.
Just for the chance to play you my song
The thrill when I hear you singing along.
It's been worth everything I've been through
To do what I do.
I've played for empty tables and chairs
The drunks that don't listen the crowds that don't care.
Been told countless times Boy you ain't goin' nowhere
To do what I do.
So I hope the critics and skeptics alike
All bought a ticket to this show tonight.
And they'll see firsthand that I have survived
And what doesn't kill you makes you more alive.
And I'm one of the fortunate few
To do what I do.
There's so much joy this music can bring
So I count my blessings when I step up to sing.
Cause they're so many people who would give anything
To do what I do.
And I thank you.
I can do what I do <start> They were quite a pair
The way that love should be
They still held hands
For the world to see
She's thankful that she had him
All those years
But she still has days
She can't hold back the tears
She misses their Monday night bowling league
When they'd wear their matching shirts
She misses their Wednesday night dinner out
As soon as he got home from work
And Saturday morning sleeping late
Holding each other close
But she misses him on Sunday the most
She sits alone on that same old pew again
His tenor voice still echoes now and then
It brings back all those memories
Of him there by her side
What she'd give for one more Sunday drive
She misses their Monday night bowling league
When they'd wear their matching shirts
She misses their Wednesday night dinner out
As soon as he got home from work
And Saturday morning sleeping late
Holding each other close
But she misses him on Sunday the most
But she misses him on Sunday the most <start> When I'm lonely I think about someone someone I call Sweet Misery
In her arms I was in heaven but heaven wasn't meant for me
I still love her oh but I've lost her when she walked out the hurt walked in
Now our love's gone just like an old song that no one ever wants to hear again
I count heartaches that a big fool makes and I think about my Sweet Misery
To my sorrow each new tomorrow proves there ain't never been a bigger fool than me
Cause in her arms I was in heaven but heaven wasn't meant for me
Oh when I'm lonely I think about someone someone I call Sweet Misery
Someone I call sweet misery someone I call Sweet Misery <start> He gives her attention he's constantly carefully planting the seeds
The only thing missing is really the only thing she needs
And he can't give that to her and she can't find it with him
So she'll have to find her way out of love she's not really in
Chorus
She can live with what goes with leaving
She knows it's the only way
Though it kills her to give up believin'
She can't live with herself if she stays
She could settle for what she'd be feeling
If she gave in and worked this one out
She doesn't want the kind of love she can live with
She wants the kind of love she can't live without
She looks in the mirror and sees all the sadness in her eyes
It's never been clearer what he's asking her to sacrifice
But she can't be his forever she can't even be his for now
She'll have to be kind to them both and let go of him somehow
Chorus <start> I went into his prison cell
To write his story if he'd tell
He spoke as tears fell from his eyes
And he told me when and how and why
And he said
I asked my love to take a walk
Just to walk a little ways
And as we walked then we could talk
About our future wedding day
But when she said she could never be mine
Well I held a knife against her breast
As into my arms she pressed
She cried my love don't you murder me
'Cause I'm not prepared for eternity
Then only say that you'll be mine
And in no others' arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio
I started home twixt twelve and one
I cried My God what have I done
I've killed the one I love tonight
Because she would not be my bride
Well only say that you'll be mine
And in no others' arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio
Down by the banks of the Ohio
Save my soul Lord
Save my soul
There beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio <start> It was long long ago in the moonlight
We were sitting on the banks of the stream
When you whispered so sweetly I love you
As the waters murmured a tune
Oh they tell me your love is like a flower
In the springtime blossoms so fair
In the fall then they wither away dear
And they tell me that's the way of your love
I remember the night little darling
We were talking of days gone by
When you told me you always would love me
That for me your love would never die
It was spring when you whispered these words dear
The flowers were all blooming so fair
But today as the snow falls around us
I can see that your love is not there <start> Just at the close of a bright summer day just as the twilight had faded away
Soft on the breeze like the cool of a dove someone was singin' an old song of love
Tell me you love me and say you'll be true I love nobody in this world but you
Your heart and my heart and love will entwine
You give me your love and I'll give you mine
Stroll along with me to the quiet shady nook
Where flowers bloom at the side of the brook
Nature is safe dear the birds are red dressed
I place a wild rose on your beautiful breast
Tell me you love me... <start> 
When you feel like you're in love don't just stand there
When you see that moon above don't just stand there
You gotta laugh dance and sing you gotta get that gal a ring
When you feel like you're in love don't just stand there
When the moon is shining bright in your Saturday night
You're not havin' any fun then maybe you ride with the wrong one
When you feel like you're in love hold her tighter
And the moon and stars above all shine brighter
You gotta laugh dance and sing...
 guitar 
You gotta laugh dance and sing...
When the moon is shining bright...
You gotta laugh dance and sing... <start> 
Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Day is abreaking in my soul.
Oh where are our dear mothers
Day is abreaking in my soul.
They are down in the valley praying
Day is abreaking in my soul.
Oh where are our dear fathers
Day is abreaking in my soul.
They have gone to heaven shouting
Day is abreaking in my soul.
Bright morning stars are rising
Day is abreaking in my soul. <start> If i had my way
every road woulda been the right one
every burden been a light one
every chance the one to take
If i had my way
i'd found every thing i been miss
i wouldn't have a need for wishin
i would wont for better days
but if i had my way
i never would have learned the lessons of a struggle
or the blessings in the hurt
i would have lost the moment when you find a little faith
god knows where i'd be if i had my way
if i had my way
i'd never touched a bottle
never found that a couple swollows
could numb most anything
if i had my way
i'd never let a love leave
never felt a pain so deep
never cried so many tears
but if i had my way
i never would have known
theres a strength in admitting
that you cant let go
i would have lost the moment
when you find a little faith
god knows where i'd be
if i had my way
ohh
if i had my way
i never would've believed
that you can get through anything
when your down on your knees
i wouldn have lost a moment when i found a little faith
oh god knows where id be if i had my way
gods knows where id be if i had my way. <start> Got my eye on a boy
He's eyeing me back
It's looking real good
This could be it
And I know that all of you girls
Would love to steal him away
He bought me a drink
I thanked him real sweet
It's always so nice when you first meet
And I know that all of you women would love to steal him away
So I'm warning you
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Building up an appetite
You can look but you can't buy
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Pretty as a picture
Comin' on so strong
He's twisting my ignition key
Turn my motor on
But anyone can see all his attention's on me
Give us some privacy
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Better keep your hands off my
It's a welcome turn to try
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Leave us alone tonight
Then if it don't work out right
He's all your's
Until then
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
They keep crowdin' in on me
He smiles rather unsuspiciously
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Building up an appetite
You can look but you can't buy
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend <start> I wish you only knew all the days I've made it through
Because of you and your sweet love
I wish that I could count the times peace and comfort filled my mind
Because of you and your sweet love
You're what keeps me going the sun that lights my sky
The rose that blooms in winter the rain that cools July
Never try to tell me that it wasn't God above
That sent me you and your sweet love
Almost every night it seems you come walking through my dreams
Precious you and your sweet love
And tonight though we're apart there's a fullness in my heart
Thanks to you and your sweet love
You're the rock I cling to the star I wish upon
The water in my desert the anchor in my storm
Never try to tell me that it wasn't God above
That sent me you and your sweet love
That sent me you and your sweet love <start> Who at the door is standing
Patiently drawing near
Entrance within demanding
Whose is the voice I hear
All through the dark hours dreary
Knocking again is He
Oh Jesus at Thou not weary
Waiting so long for me
Sweetly the tones are falling
Open the door for me
Oh if Thou will heed my calling
I will abide with Thee
Sweetly the tones are falling
Open the door for me
Oh if Thou will heed my calling
I will abide with Thee
Door to my heart I hasten
Thee will open wide
Tho' He rebuke and chasten
He shall with me abide
Sweetly the tones are falling
Open the door for me
Oh if Thou will heed my calling
I will abide with Thee <start> Lost in a daydream
That will not come true
Since you've gone I seem to
Get lost in a daydream of you
And if I saw you today
Down on the street I would say
A few words you would see
That you are truly meant for me
If I could live my life in reverse
Maybe then I could break that curse
And start again
Instead of losing we might win
I make big plans like a big man
What it comes down to is you see right through me
And all of my silly daydreams
You and I know they will never come true <start> Chorus
Things are tough all over
And I'm losin' badly
I wish you were still here
And I say it sadly
But if you wanna come back
Cause you need a shoulder
Things are tough all over
Guess I should count my blessings
For the life I still have
In a world of misfortune
That can happen so fast
Life size dominoes
One falls after another
Things are tough all over
Baby if you needed me
I'd of heard by now
Well I hope you're not hurtin'
On the other side of town
Cause things are tough all over
Things are tough all over
Well baby if you needed me
I'd of heard by now
Well I hope you're not hurtin'
On the other side of town
Chorus
Things are tough all over
Things are tough
Tough
Things are tough
Yeah things are tough <start> You can shake it yacan break it

Nights get cold or love is blue
Just snuggle up honey you're my one and only
Any old time I'm here for you.
Pay no mind to the hour
Or how far away you may be.
Any old time you can find me drop in a dime
and there I'll be.
Any old time you start missin'
Somebody to hold to keep you company
I'll be willin' when you want my kissin'
Any old time just call on me.
Pay no mind to the hour
Or how far away you may be.
Any old time you can find me drop in a dime
and there I'll be. <start> It's been so long darling since I had to go away
It's been so long darling and I'll never forget that day
Although you never mentioned it you cried that whole day long
It's been so long darling but now I'm coming home
It's been so long darling since I gazed into your eyes
It's been so long darling do you really realize
That just the thought of seeing you it scares me through and through
It's been so long darling since I had a kiss from you
 guitar 
It's been so long darling but it won't be long now
It's been so long darling but I've kept every vow
I pray that you'll be waiting as you did in days gone by
It's been so long darling please don't blame me if I cry <start> Verse 
Why do we hate Why do we suffer
Why do we make our mistakes and constantly blame one another
Why is there war and why is there killing
Have we forgotten some secret we knew back when we were just children
Chorus
If I had wings I'd fly up to heaven.
I'd look down from the clouds on every thing
then I could find all the things we've been missin'.
I would have all the answers if I had wings.
Verse 
Like why I am here and where did I come from
and where would I go when my time here on this earth is done
and what would I leave that would go on forever
Oh no and what can I do while I'm here to make someone's life better
Chorus Repeats <start> I talk to myself about you Dear
I can't realize that we're through
I know in my heart that I'm wastin' my time
When I talk to my self about you
I talk to my heart about you Dear
I tell it I'll find someone new
But somehow I know I'm just foolin' my heart
When I talk to my heart about you
I'm trying my best to forget you
But Darlin' it's so hard to do
I can't help but feel that the words are in vain
When I talk to myself about you
I tell all my friends that it's over
I say I don't care what you do
But they seem to know when the tears fill my eye
That I talk to myself about you <start> Just you know why
Why you and I
Will by and by
Know true love ways
Sometimes we'll sigh
Sometimes we'll cry
And you know why
Just you and I know true love ways
Throughout the days
Our true love ways
Will bring us joys to share
With those who really care
Sometimes we'll sigh
And sometimes we'll cry
And you know why
Just you and I know true love ways
Throughout the days
Our true love ways
Will bring us joys to share
With those who really care
Sometimes we'll sigh
And sometimes we'll cry
And you know why
Just you and I know true love ways <start> Sierra Sue I'm sad and lonely the rocks and rills are lonely too
Sierra Sue I want you only no one but you Sierra Sue
The roses weep their tears are falling the gentle doves no longer coo
Oh can't you hear my sad heart calling calling for you Sierra Sue
Sierra Sue I want you only <start> Brass buttons green silks and silver shoes
Warm evenings pale mornings bottle of blues
And the tiny golden pins that she wore up in her hair
Brass buttons green silks and silver shoes
My mind was young until she grew
My secret thoughts known only by the few
It was a dream much to real
To be leaned against too long
All the time I think she knew
Her words still dance inside my head
Her comb still lies beside my bed
And the sun comes up without her
It just doesn't know she's gone
Ooh but I remember everything she said
Brass buttons green silks and silver shoes
Warm evenings pale mornings bottle of blues
And the tiny golden pins that she wore up in her hair
Brass buttons green silks and silver shoes <start> The way you kissed me this morning
It told me that you soon would be going
You didn't even look in my eyes
When you said goodbye
And last night in your sleep you broke all the promises
That I knew you would never keep
Now I'm reading the letter which you placed on the dresser
And you're five hundred miles down the road
Escape is so simple
In a world where sunsets can be raced
But distance only looses the knife
The pattern of its scar
Can always be traced
Yeah I remember when we said 'forever'
Was the craziest word that we knew
But I think that I like it much better than I do 'goodbye'
And I could sit here all evening and think of the reasons
Why you are not by my side
Instead I'll go to the kitchen find a strong chair to sit in
And drink myself far far away
Escape is so simple
In a world where sunsets can be raced
But distance only looses the knife
The pattern of its scar
Can always be traced <start> Take me back to Tulsa I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa I'm too young to marry
You see that girl with the red dress on
Some folks call her Dinah
Stoled my heart away from me
Way down in Louisiana
Take me back to Tulsa I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa I'm too young to marry
The big bee sucks the blossom
And the little bee makes the honey
Poor man throws the cotton
And the rich man makes the money
Take me back to Tulsa I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa I'm too young to marry
We travel all over this country wide
Playing music by the hour
Always wear this great big smile
We never do look sour
Take me back to Tulsa I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa I'm too young to marry
Would I go
You
Let me off
And I'll walk down to Greenwood
Take me back to Tulsa I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa I'm too young to marry <start> I feel like cryin' my heart is breakin' thought you were makin' a true love to me
I feel like cryin' now I'm forsaken and you have taken the heart out of me
 guitar 
I saw you darling in town last night you and your new love were doing all right
I stood there staring with such a pride I couldn't really believe my own life
I feel like cryin'...
No use denyin' I still love you I feel like cryin' what else can I do <start> Faithfully ray as the day may be
Somehow we always seek hope in tomorrow
Faithfully dark as the night may seem
We close our eyes and dream of a new day
Why do we have such strong belief
Oh such a long belief in tomorrow
Because we know as long as it may be showed
Our prayers will be answered so faithfully
Why do we have such strong belief <start> I'd rather be alone and have you dream of me only
Than have you say you're sorry that we are apart
I'd rather be alone and have you dream of me only
Than to be in your arms but never in your heart
Well I've just received your letter you asked me to come home
You say you're sorry that you went away
This is an old old story and I've heard it all before
So darlin' this is all that I can say
I tried so hard my darlin' to make you love me then
'Cause you would always leave me here alone
And although I could forgive you things would be the same
Nothing could ever change your heart of stone <start> My Boy Burns

Like a  alarm fire

Tears and ash in his wake
Tears and ash in his wake

Like the tail of a comet
And we are tossed in his wake
And we are tossed in his wake

You are my special angel
Sent from up above
The Lord smiled down on me
And sent an angel to love 
You are my special angel
Right from paradise
I know that you're an angel
Heaven is in your eyes
A smile from your lips
Bring the summer sunshine
The tears from your eyes bring the rain
I feel your touch your warm embrace
And I'm in heaven again
You are my special angel
Through eternity
I'll have my special angel
Here to watch over me



I feel your touch
Your warm embrace
And I'm in heaven again
You are my special angel
Through eternity
I'll have my special angel
Here to watch over me 
Here to watch over me

 <start> Meet me on the banks of the Yangtze Suzie
Beneath the glare of the NewWest Yard
We'll watch the barges cart away
The waste of another day
We'll watch the barges cart away
The waste of another day
Meet me in the middle of Renmin Park
Where the stone bridge meets the pond
We'll watch the ducklings gobbling bread
And the stealth of the approaching swan
We'll watch the ducklings gobbling bread
And the stealth of the approaching swan
Listen for the song of the propane seller bouncing off the walls
A kiss before the morning knows I'm gone
A kiss before the new day finds me gone
Listen for the song of the propane seller drifting through our dreams
You at the end of your sky and me in the corner of my sea
His morning cry a promise to you from me
His morning song a blessing on you and me <start> Stop that knocking on my front door
I know what you're up to now
Don't be coming 'round here no more
Flashing that smile around
I know what you're doing to me
I know that you're the heartbreak kind
Well honey you almost fooled me
But I wised up just in time
One step from a heartache
Two steps from the blues
So close to a teardrop
I know what you were gonna do
But I'm one step ahead of you
Don't be calling me on the phone
I'm hanging up if you do
I know you only been putting me on
But honey I'm on to you
I let down my defenses
When I saw those big brown eyes
But I came to my senses
Just in the nick of time
One step from a heartache
Two steps from the blues
So close to a teardrop
I know what you were gonna do
But I'm one step ahead of you
One step from a heartache
Two steps from the blues
So close to a teardrop
I know what you were gonna do
But I'm one step ahead of you
One step from a heartache
Two steps from the blues
So close to a teardrop
I know what you were gonna do
But I'm one step ahead of you <start> All I own everything I do
I would surrender for one more tender night with you

All that's mine all that I possess
Struggled and paid for I'd gladly trade for your caress

I live and breathe your memory every day
I'm so afraid in time you'll slip away

Here inside forever you'll remain
I'd give up each pleasure and all that I treasure
If I could have you back again

I've dreamed of ways that could erase
The wrong that I've done
But everything I've tried has gone astray

Every night somewhere in my sleep
My dreams come true my rendezvous with you I keep

I wish that I could change the way you feel
And somehow bring an end to my ordeal

My heart sings his old refrain
I could recapture the joy and the rapture
If I could have you back again

I could recapture the joy and the rapture
If I could have you back again
If only I could have you back again <start> At the end of the day my heart's filled with despair
I knelt by my bed for a moment of prayer
I asked God to help me and show me the way
Then out of the darkness a voice seemed to say
Follow me and your sins will be washed snowy white
Follow me to the streets that are paved with pure gold
Follow me and your darkness would turn into light
You'll see riches and treasures untold
 steel 
I was lost in a world filled with doubt and the shame
Each day brought me tears that I'd fall by the way
Then out of the rocks and the caverns they came
A voice that somehow seemed to say
Follow me and your load will be lighter to bear
Follow and your heart will be free from all care
Follow me and I'll make you a place with him there if you would just follow me <start> She'd rather wear a pair of cutoff jeans
Than a fancy evening dress
And with her windows rolled down
And her hair all blown around
She's a hot southern mess
She'll take a beer over white wine
A campfire over candle light
And when it comes to love
Oh her idea of a romantic night
Listenin' to old Alabama drivin' through Tennessee
A little dixieland delight at the right time of the night
And she can't keep her hands off of mee
And now we're rollin' down an old back road
I got the steering wheel in one hand
We'll find a hideaway where she and I can play
In mother nature's band
Now we're listenin' to old Alabama
Parked somewhere in Tennessee
A little dixieland delight and it feels so right
And it's love in the first degree ee ee
Forget about Sinatra or Coltrane
Or some ol' righteous brothers song
And Barry White ain't gonna work tonight
If you really wanna turn her on
Play some back home come on music
That comes from the heart
Play something with lots of feeling
'cause that's where music has to start
Now we're listenin' to old Alabama
And we're drivin' through Tennessee
A little dixieland delight and it feels so right
And its love in the first degree
Yeah' you know we're listenin' to old Alabama 
Drivin' through Tennessee 
A little why lady why at the right time of the night
Oh and she can't keep her hands off of mee
Oh play me some old Alabama
Oh play me some old Alabama
Won't you play me some old Alabama
Oh pla ee ay ay yee haw
So the one you loved just left you for another
And your down
Or you lost your job and you need a drink
You look around and start to think
That no one understands what you been through <start> Just to hurt me just to see me sit and cry
Just to know that you brought teardrops to my eyes
Just to hurt me that's all you ever do
And just because you know I love you oh so true
Guess you know that I settle down to be a fool
Just to hurt me that's all you ever do
My life has no meaning when you're not here
And though you don't need me I know that you're near
Oh makes no difference I just hang around and try
Though you say things that break my heart inside
Just to hurt me mhm that's all you ever do
Yes just to hurt me that's all you ever do <start> There was a time when I thought of no other and we sang our own love refrain
Our hearts beat as one while we had our fun but time changes everything
Time has passed I forgot you mother nature does wonderful things
I guess that it's true for me and for you that time changes everything
You can change the name of an old song rearrange it and make it swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you but time has changed everything
Goodbye good luck to you may God bless you I won't say I'll ever love again
You'll go your way and I'll go mine cause time changes everything <start> Valerie

To the east and factories stand like fire breathing dragons against the sky.
And from their throats a scarlet river burns itself into smoky lullabies.
Over neon and fluorescent skies.
VALERIE CAN YOU HEAR THOSE ENGINES DRONE.
I WANTED TO GO TO MEXICO BUT I'M STRANDED HERE ALONE.
AND ONCE I KNEW A TRUE LOVE IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS SINCE HE'S GONE.
AND IF I COULD GET THAT FEELING BACK I'D GIVE UP EVERYTHING I OWN.
Sixteen days since I left corona and I traveled to this carnival town near Alberndeel.
And I rode the coaster there on the fairground. Twisted backbone of a beast that never heals. And I left some skin on fortunes wheel.
VALERIE CAN YOU HEAR THOSE ENGINES DRONE.
I WANTED TO GO TO MEXICO BUT I'M STRANDED HERE ALONE.
AND ONCE I KNEW A TRUE LOVE IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS SINCE HE'S GONE.
AND IF I COULD GET THAT FEELING BACK I'D GIVE UP EVERYTHING I OWN.
Everything's in slow motion now in this little border town.
I've come so close from so far.
Just to hide behind these windows here from the world outside.
I watch those cars and trucks raise trails of dust down the road as they pass by.
VALERIE CAN YOU HEAR THOSE ENGINES DRONE.
I WANTED TO GO TO MEXICO BUT I'M STRANDED HERE ALONE.
AND ONCE I KNEW A TRUE LOVE IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS SINCE HE'S GONE.

Tell you what I'd do

Crazy 'bout a mercury
Lord I'm crazy bout a mercury
I'm gonna buy me a mercury
And cruise it up and down the road
Well the girl I love
I stole her from a friend
He got lucky stole her back again
She heard he had a mercury
Lord she's crazy 'bout a mercury
I'm gonna buy me a mercury
And cruise it up and down the road
Well hey now mama
You look so fine
Ridin' round in your mercury 
Crazy 'bout a mercury

Bought herself a mercury come a cruisin' home

But he always prays when the thing takes off
And the grandma that he's next to watches the window
Three B's got her headphones on
She's still not used to her daddy being gone
She gets to see him every three months for the weekend
Just people in planes
Seventeen A's in an exit row
Waiting for his Jack and Coke to show
Just wishing he didn't settle so fast in college
I'm over here in a middle seat
Watching the world but half asleep
Wondering why there's never movies on the ones I'm on
And it occurs to me
Maybe I've got too much time to think
But it helps to be reminded how we're
Just people in planes when it comes down to it
We're side by side on the same ride
There's not a whole lot of difference
At the end of the day
We just want to know it's going to be okay
Counting on somebody we can't see to land this thing
We're just people in planes
Hey do you remember back when
Your dad could still lift you then
He'd pick you up and you'd think that you were flying
You'd spread your arms and start to land
Do you remember how to laugh like that
Why does that baby feel like crying
We 're just people in planes when it comes down to it
We're side by side on the same ride
There's not a whole lot of difference
At the end of the day
We just want to know it's going to be okay
Counting on somebody we can't see to land this thing
We're just people in planes
The girl in front of me spilling their guts to some lady
She's never met and will never see again
Has been weighing for a long time on her conscience
There's seat kickers and loud talkers
Honeymoon lovers and several in the back there looking hung over
Must be coming back from Mexico...or Vegas
People in planes when it comes down to it
We're side by side on the same ride
There's not a whole lot of difference
At the end of the day
We just want to know it's going to be okay
Counting on somebody we can't see to land this thing
We're all waiting on somebody we can't see to land this thing
We're just people in planes
Just people in planes <start> When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in my cradle

My mama would rock me in my cradle
In those old cotton fields back home
Oh when those cotton ball get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields back home
It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in my cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in my cradle

Kiss her on the mouth just as sweet as any wine
Wraps herself around me like a sweet potatoe vine

Goin' up t' Cripple Creek t' have a little fun
Goin' up t' Cripple Creek goin in a whirl
Goin' up t' Cripple Creek t' see my girl

Jump on a man like a dog on a bone

After my show thought I'd have a little fun
Hopped on a horse Lord he sure could run
Well I got a butt kickin when the police finally caught me
Give me back my horse
Not a moment too soon Tim McGraw jumped in
Did his best Jackie Chan got a cop on the chin
Now I don't understand why they's arresting me
My cellmate thinks I'm sexy
I really turn him on
He's always staring at me
When them guards are gone
I'm running out of cigarettes
He's asking me to dance
He say's I'm looking good
In these orange pants
I really wish Tim McGraw was here to protect me
My cellmate thinks I'm sexy
I'd give anything to be back on my bus
I'm hiding in my bunk but he's climbing on up
Swears all he wants me to do is sing him one of my songs
Says he's got a dream I'm afraid of what it is
You're never gonna see me on a horse after this
I only get one call I hope Faith is home
Answer the phone
My cellmate thinks I'm sexy
He just won't leave me alone
He's blowing kisses at me
And I'm a duckin' 'em all
I hate to break it to him
I'm in no mood for romance
What part of NO don't this fool understand
I'm in big trouble if someone don't come and get me
My cellmate thinks I'm sexy
Well one day behind bars is long enough
Cause when I drop that soap oh his eyes light up
My cellmate thinks I UH
My cellmate thinks I'm sexy
I really turn him on
My name is Kenny Chesney
This ain't nowhere I belong
Me and Tim's in trouble
Buddy one thing is for sure
George Strait's gonna kick us off his George Strait Tour
I'd call Tracy Lawrence but he's in the next cell beside me
My cellmate thinks I'm sexy
My Cellmate Thinks I'm sexy
Uh
I had him from hello
Wazzup <start> It ain't always easy
To love somebody
You can't live without
You drive me crazy
But somehow babe
You pull me back around
Even on our worst day
When we're fighting
Like we're enemies
There ain't no doubtin'
You're the only one for me
I wouldn't get in my car
Drive across town
If you were anyone else
I wouldn't stand out in the rain
Willing to make a fool of myself
No I wouldn't give in
Just to taste your kiss
And you know damn well
I wouldn't fight like hell
If you were anyone else
If you were anyone else
Sometimes I hate you
Or at least I want to
But I can't stay mad
Cause I love you enough
To take off my gloves
And reach out my hand
I may get far enough
To let the dust
Settle down
But fast as I leave
I'm always turning back around
I wouldn't get in my car
Drive across town
If you were anyone else
I wouldn't stand out in the rain
Willing to make a fool of myself
No I wouldn't give in
Just to taste your kiss
And you know damn well
I wouldn't fight like hell
If you were anyone else
If you were anyone else
If I could imagine
Life without you in it
And forget that I love you
I wouldn't get in my car
Drive across town
If you were anyone else
I wouldn't stand out in the rain
Willing to make a fool of myself
No I wouldn't give in
Just to taste your kiss
And you know damn well
I wouldn't fight like hell
If you were anyone else
If you were anyone else
If you were anyone else  <start> For thirty some odd years he faced a grinder in the city
Hustlin' day in day out just tryin' to survive
He bought his wife the finer thingsand sent his kids to collage
That always took what little bit he tried to put aside
But through it all he had one thing that seemed to keep him going
A dream that someday he could leave this city life behind
I watched his hair turn thin and gray but his dream never faded
He told me all about it at least a thousand times.
Chorus
He always wanted a place out in the country
Where the birds sing in the morningand the grass is emerald green
A place where he could feel the mornin' sunshine
And sit out in the evenin' where the air is fresh and clean.
It took lots of overtime to keep his wife up with the jonses
And more to get his son out of his runins with the law
The more it took the more he gave never once complaining
I don't know how he ever stood the pressure of it all.
I never thought he'd make it but he finally left the city
And now he's got that special little place to call his own
Today I took a ride out in the country just to see him
It wasn't hard to find because his name was on the stone.
Chorus x <start> Have you ever seen a sight as beautiful
As that of the rainsoaked purple
Of the white birch in spring
Have you ever felt more fresh or wonderful
Than on a warm fall night
Under a Mackerel sky
The smell of grapes on the wind
Well I have known all these things
And the joys that they can bring
And I'll share them all for a cup of coffee
And to wear your ring
Have you ever had the pleasure of watching
A quiet winter's snow slowly gathering
Like simple moments adding up
Have you ever satisfied a gut feeling
To follow a dry dirt road that's beckoning you
To the heart of a shimmering summer's day
Well I have known all these things
And the joys that they can bring
And I'll share them all for a cup of coffee
And to wear your ring
And I don't know how I survived those days
Before I held your hand
Well I never thought that I would be the one
To admit that the moon and the sun
Shine so much more brighter when
Seen through two pairs of eyes than
When seen through just one
Have you ever seen a sight as beautiful
As a face in a crowd of people
That lights up just for you
Have you ever felt more fresh or wonderful
As when you wake
By the side of that boy or girl
Who has pledged their love to you
Well I have known all these things
And the joys that they can bring
And now every morning there's a cup of coffee
And I wear your ring <start> Blue railroad train goin' down the railroad track
It makes me feel so doggone blue to listen to that old smoke stack
Come back again let me hear your whistle blow
You're takin' the sun and leavin' the rain and makin' me want to go
I've got the blues longin' for her company
It's many miles from where I am to the only one for me
Well it's lonesome here waiting for the manifest
I hope that engineer is kind enough to let me be his guest
And I'm not as bad as you might think I am
Though I've traveled here or hobo'ed there
Rambled these states around

You take me where I want to go I get my transportation's free <start>  Ira Alen 
In the silence of this darken room my mind reels with a fragnance of your perfume
In your mind stormy thoughts are growing
Mhm I feel a cold cold wind a blowing woman I feel a cold cold wind a blowing
It's been a lifetime since I been close to you still no one really knows you like I do
With clouds in your mind and ray in your eyes a showing
Mhm I feel a cold cold wind a blowing woman I feel a cold cold wind a blowing
With my arms around you I hold you tight
Though you do the same to me girl you don't feel right
You've got a way of leavin' without going

Took you home set you on the counter
Oh at least a time or two
Maybe she'd thought it through
Yellow sunset slowly dipping down in the rear view
Oh how she'd love to sit and watch you
I could have done that a whole lot more
If I hadn't been so stubborn been so selfish
Thought about her more thought about me less
Joked and make her laugh held her when she cried
A little more that maybe I
Wouldn't be driving like hell flying like crazy down the highway
Calling everyone we know stopping any place she might be
Going any place she might go beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along maybe maybe yeah maybe
She wouldn't be gone she wouldn't be gone
She warned me it was coming said if I didn't change
She was leaving
I just didn't believe she would ever really walk out
God I believe her now
Called her mamma cried like a baby to her best friend
If they've seen her they ain't sayin' they ain't sayin'
Now I'm cursing like a fool praying it ain't too late
All I wanna do is fix my mistakes.
Find her beg her for one more try until then damn it I'll
Be driving like hell flying like crazy down the highway
Calling everyone we know stopping any place she might be
Going any place she might go beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along maybe maybe yeah maybe
She wouldn't be gone
I wouldn't be beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along maybe maybe yeah maybe
She wouldn't be gone

Took you home set you on the counter oh at least a time or two
Maybe she'd thought it through <start> There was a bad boy in the school yard
Waited on you every day
Seemed like every time you turned around
Well he was standin' in your way
Well he broke your glasses
The girls all laughed
As he pushed you to the floor
But then you stood up one day knowin'
You couldn't stand it anymore
And your gentle hand was finally clenched in rage
You were face to face
Face to face with the devil that you've been dreadin'
Eye to eye finally has arrived
But bad as it was well now brother wasn't it better
Dealin' with him face to face
Your date showed up with flowers
And you thought your dreams had come
But with every passing hour
You felt it come undone
Then the night exploded and you begged him no
But he forever changed your life
And now he waits a judge and jury
Thinkin' you'll break down inside
And with a finger you can put his fists away
And you're face to face
Face to face with the devil that you've been dreadin'
Eye to eye finally has arrived
But bad as it was well little sister wasn't it better
Dealin' with him face to face
'Cause it'll never go away
Until the fear that you are runnin' from is finally embraced
Drivin' by the grave yard
On a wicked winter's eve
And you're wonderin' why a man of faith
Is whistlin' nervously
Then you stop the car
And you hold your heart
'Cause you finally realize
Hell the devil ain't in the darkness
He's a'rattlin' 'round inside
And with folded hands you truly start to pray
And you're face to face
Face to face with the devil that you've been dreadin'
Eye to eye finally has arrived
But bad as it was well now brother wasn't it better
Dealin' with him face to face
'Cause it'll never go away
Until the fear that you are runnin' from is finally embraced
Face to face <start> When I was a little bitty baby my mama would rock me in my cradle
In those old cottonfields back home
When I was a little bitty baby my mama would rock me in my cradle
In those old cottonfields back home
Oh when those cotton bolls get rotten you can't pick very much cotton
In those old cottonfields back home
It was down in Louisiana just about a mile from Texarkana
In those old cottonfields back home
When I was a little bitty baby...
In those old cottonfields back home <start> I got a reputation going round
Ain't never been the kind to back down
I've thrown a punch or two and gave a few black eyes
But Jack Daniels kicked my ass again last night
I did pretty good for a round or two
But he don't fight fair like daddy taught me to
Yeah her memory turned my head and he snuck up from behind
Yeah Jack Daniels kicked my ass again last night
Always thought this heart was made of steel and bulletproof
But the memory of her taillights fading just breaks it right in two
They say every Superman has got his kryptonite
Yeah Jack Daniels kicked my ass again last night
Well I didn't bleed and I ain't black and blue
It ain't hard to tell who got the better of who
'Cause in the morning light I'm hard to recognize
Yeah Jack Daniels kicked my ass again last night
Always thought this heart was made of steel and bulletproof
But the memory of her taillights fading just breaks it right in two
They say every Superman has got his kryptonite
Jack Daniels kicked my ass again last night
That black label's like black powder for my soul
Yeah my head feels like a bomb about to blow
Hell I'm halfway inclined to give that fuse a light
That Jack Daniels kicked my ass again tonight <start> Stranger here
Face down in the river floating by
A backwards sky
Stranger here hung by the neck
Jeered by the crowd
Stranger here stranger here
And I could tell you about the time
I was looking for a rhyme
Communing with the planets above
I am the righteous man
The one you're looking for
I am a stranger here
I am a stranger here
Stranger here
The legend will be told about the boy
Never hungry never cold
Stranger here smoke in my eyes
Strange taste on my tongue
I am a stranger here
I am a stranger here
And I could tell you about the evening
That I was out drinking
And fell asleep by the side of the well
I am the righteous man
The one you're looking for
I am a stranger here
I am a stranger here
And I could tell you about the time
I was swinging from the twine
And saw you flirting with that Jackinthecrowd
I am the righteous man
The one you're looking for
I am a stranger here
I am a stranger here
Stranger here
Head on the pillow floating by
Willows sigh <start> Get up in the morning fall out of bed
Go down to the basement cook up a little meth
All the young folks love it coming back for more
Ain't it good to be working got your foot in the door
Hey hell ain't half full
Got the light on for you son
Hell ain't half full
Room for everyone
They chased God and Jesus out of our schools
And everybody's living by their own set of rules
Yeah they're preaching on the corner nothing good to say
Better think of something boy come the judgment day
Hey hell ain't half full
Got the light on for you son
Hell ain't half full
No need to run
Dreamed I had a crystal ball
There wasn't much hope in the world I saw
Yeah there wasn't no love and there wasn't no law
And up in heaven above God wasn't paying much attention at all
Hey hell ain't half full
Got the light on for you son
Hell ain't half full
Room for everyone
Got the flashing light
Got the vacancy sign
Hell ain't half full
Check in any time <start> Life is just a passing moment
On an never ending trail
Though my pathway wanders for a heart
Someday my ship will sail
But I will walk this road awhile
And I will walk it with a smile
I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied
There's eternity before me
Just beyond the darkening veil
O my spirit hollers to go on
Someday my ship will sail
But I will walk this road awhile
And I will walk it with a smile
I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied
Someday I'll be satisfied <start> Sometimes I want to throw my arms around you
Then I tremble at the thought of giving in
Because I know how much it cost to love you
And I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you revives the sorrow
That wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow
Oh but I'm so afraid of losing you again
If heaven were to hear my heart's confession
Oh wanting you would be my greatest sin
But I'm glad that you're no longer my possession
'Cause I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you
Yes I'm so afraid of losing you again <start> 
Mama I remember what you told me
You said you wait for love before you fall
But mama I am sorry I guess it's gonna be love after all
'Cause mama when he holds me
The air is thick and sweet
He asked me if I'd come tonight
And hold him in his sleep
And I'm almost in love
I can feel myself fallin'
Yes I'm almost in love
I can hear my heart fallin'
'Cause I'm almost in
Yes I'm almost in love
Mama I've grown into a woman
I been growing stronger and stronger day by day
Mama you know about children
You raise them then they'll go away
Mama when he holds me
He thrills me through and through
So dry your eyes and teach me how to say goodbye to you
And I'm almost in love
I can feel myself fallin'
Yes I'm almost in love
I can hear my heart fallin'
'Cause I'm almost in
Yes I'm almost in love
Yes I'm almost in love
I can feel myself fallin'
Yes I'm almost in love
I can hear my heart fallin'
Yes I'm almost in love
I can feel myself fallin'
Yes I'm almost in love
I can hear my heart fallin'
'Cause I'm almost
Yes I'm almost in love <start> When God paints birds sing
He colors every feather on a sparrow's wings
When God paints the wind blows
With a stroke of love he dips his brush in a rainbow
Sometimes I take for granted the simple things
I can be his biggest critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain
When God paints the heart beats
Life begins a season ends and lovers meet
And I've learned that sometimes
It's not always black and white or welldefined
When God paints
Sometimes I take for granted the simple things
I can be his biggest critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain
When God paints we dance
And I reach across the canvas and I take your hand
And my world is so complete
When I look at you a masterpiece is all I see
When God paints
Sometimes I take for granted the simple things
I can be his big as critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain
When God paints
I pray I always see the beauty inside the frame
When God paints <start> The moment that I looked at you a voice inside of me
Said you'd better guard your heart and love him cautiously
Well If I'd only listened to the things I heard me say
I'd have still been standing when you took your love away
Tell me baby was it hard to keep up your charade
Did you mark me from the start as a target to be played
I feel so badly cheated I don't know what to say
Made it look so easy when you took your love away
I gave to you my inside I gave to you my heart
I gave to you no reason to tear it all apart
Now I'm diggin' through the rubble of a trust that's been betrayed
You did a lot of damage when you took your love away
The only hope I ever have about you anymore
Is someday someone comes along to even up the score
You won't see it coming you'll just look on in dismay
You'll be so blind sided when she takes her love away
I gave to you my inside I gave to you my heart
I gave to you no reason to tear it all apart
Now I'm diggin' through the rubble of a trust that's been betrayed
You did a lot of damage when you took your love away
I gave to you my inside I gave to you my heart
I gave to you no reason to tear it all apart
Now I'm diggin' through the rubble of a trust that's been betrayed
You did a lot of damage when you took your love away
Did a lot of damage when you took your love away <start> I found a place that you won't believe a place
Where your memories fade away
And I'm here with a friend that's so good to me
So good I can't remember yesterday
But it's just one of the wonders of the wine
One of the wonders that keeps me from losin' my mind
If you walked in right now you'd think I owned the world
'Cause the women come around just to watch my style
But when the warm red wine is gone and I remember you
It's all that I can do to fake a smile
But it's just one of the wonders of the wine
One of the wonders that keeps me from losin' my mind <start> 
They married on a fancy yacht out on the water
He knew she was young enough to be his daughter
There always questions in the heart of millionaires
Would she make heartfelt promises if the money was not there
And he said do you love me baby do you want me to hold
Or are you just digging for gold
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul
Or are you just digging for gold
She ran his weary heart through the ringer
And she wore him like the diamond ring around her finger
Well his advances and affections she managed to avoid
But she got the lap of luxury and he got paranoid
And he said do you love me baby do you want me to hold
Or are you just digging for gold
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul
Or are you just digging for gold digging for gold
Big house limousines
Fine wines fine cuisines
Vale and Vegas twice a year
Trips to Paris on the leer
Black Tuesday when that wall of wealth came crashing down
Bad news day when that little queen had to give back her crown
And he said hey babe we can live on love 'cause love is worth much more
But he barely got his feelings out she was half way to the door
And she never even heard him cry
Do you love me baby do you want me to hold
Or are you just digging for gold
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul
Or are you just digging for gold <start> Roly Poly eatin' corn and taters
Hungry every minute of the day
Roly poly gnawin' on a biscuit
Long as he can chew it it's okay
He can eat an apple pie
And never bat an eye
He likes everything from soup to hay
Roly Poly daddy's little fatty
Bet he's gonna be a man someday
Roly Poly scrambled eggs for breakfast
Bread and jelly  times a day
Roly Poly eats a hearty dinner
It takes lots of strength to run and play
Pulls up weeds and does the chores
Runs both ways top all the stores
He works up an appetite that way
Roly Poly daddy's little fatty
Bet he's gonna be a man someday <start> As I travel life's pathway to that city beyond
I find the way so narrow and my strenght almost gone
Then I cry oh Lord have mercy please don't leave me all alone
Cause somehow I've got to make it make heaven my home
I'll keep climbing I'll keep climbing till I make it my home
And I'll soon be with Jesus round the great white throne
Though the way may seem rugged Lord I must travel on
I'll keep climbing I'll keep climbing till I make heaven my home
My friends they forsake me my companions are few
I'll keep my eyes toward heaven no matter what others do
I'll keep my mind upon Jesus for his way I will choose
Soon I'll reach heaven's portal seems it's almost in view
I'll keep climbing...
I'll keep climbing...
Make heaven my home <start> Hey girl hey girl
You warned me to go
But girl but girl
Little did I know
All the things you told me
About what lay in store
Would only make me want you more
Chorus
No not a word
Had one chance to save me
From your love
That wicked love
There's not a prayer
Left for me escaping
From your love
Yeah that wicked love
Hey girl hey girl
I begged and hollered please
But girl but girl
Even from my knees
All the things you told me
About what lay in store
Only made me want you more
Chorus
No pain can stop
Or rid me what I'm needing
From your love
That wicked love
'Cause what I crave all night
And end each day still seeking
Is your love
Yeah that wicked love
Hey girl hey girl
I tried to understand
But girl but girl
There ain't no way I can
'Cause all the things you told me
About what lay in store
Only made me want you more
Yeah all those things you told me
About what lay in store
Yeah they only made me
want you more <start> Ooooo you loved a liar
Tightrope walking on a thin wire
Ooooo you loved a stranger
My deception was a game changer
I'm sorry for what I've done to you
I'm sorry
Take me down to the water
Wash my stains in the river
These hands were not made to carry sins
Oh my past it does a'haunt me
But shame can't live where love has brought me
Tear the page out of your book
And write again
Oooo I'd give me money
Just to pay off all the demons honey
You made me your hero
I fell from grace and had nowhere to go but
Down to the water
Wash my stains in the river
These hands were not made to carry sins
Oh my past it does a'haunt me
But shame can't live where love has brought me
Tear the page out of your book
And write again
I've got a bag of rocks and I will take them to the Jordan
Leave them to remind me that the debt has been repaid
I've got the lock and key that will free me from these burdens
And carry not these heavy chains with me to the grave
And I'm sorry for what I've done to you
So take me down to the water
Wash my stains in the river
These hands were not made to carry sins
Oh my past it does a'haunt me
But shame can't live where love has brought me
Tear the page out of your book
And write again <start> There were fourteen reasons for sayin' goodbye
Like the look on her face and the look in her eye
And the way that she broke the man down
Left the man in pieces here on sinkin' ground
There were fourteen nights when she didn't come by
Fourteen days when she left the man
Wondering why he even bothered to try
So baby bye bye
Chorus
On the outside
Baby's such a pretty girl
On the inside baby ain't so pretty
Pretty soon she'll find a lonely little world
And there'll be one less man that girl can bring down
One less man with his eyes on the ground
And his heart in his hands for the take
No more promises for baby to break
There'll be one less man with a tear in his eye
One less man who'll be hangin' 'round
Wondering why he even bothered to try
So baby bye bye
Chorus
And there'll be one less man that the girl can count on
One less man she'll find hangin' strong
To the dream that she could never change now
Comes to change and baby don't know how
Baby's such a pretty girl
Chorus <start> Mother red river she wind like a copperhead
Coils and boils over dennison dam
Little white houses eggs on the rocky bed
I am the sun of the serpent I am
Raised on the river washed in the blood
Blood run thickerthan bottomland muc
And the wheel sinks deeper as the years spin 'round
Thirty bad summers in tillman county
My uncle little tree dreams of another life
Coddles his cattle and he rents his range
Holds the fan to the face of his pretty wife
She knows nothing ain't ever gonna change she was
Raised on the river
Daylight's dragon fenceline keeps me working in this trance
Poundin down the bedrock with this rusty lance
We don't stand a chance
Chikasha trickster call to the funnel cloud
Demon come screamin over Wichita falls
Lines down power out ryan and points south
Time and direction don't matter all when you're
Raised on the river
Maybe old moses come and turn this current back
Cross me over ever holy and dry
Climb me a crooked oak scarfaced bibleblack
Swing this shovel till it cracks the sky I was
Raised on the river <start> There's no doubt about it I know this time
I saw for the first time you're his you're not mine
There's no doubt about it I've reached the end of my life
I've lost my whole world this time
Yes and I bow my head and cry
And I can't help but hurt and wonder why
There's no doubt about it I've reached the end of my life
I've lost my whole world this time
Yes and I bow my head and cry <start> Darling how can I stay here without you
I have nothing to cheer my poor heart
This old world would seem sad love without you
Tell me now that we're never to part
Oh I'll pawn you my gold watch and chain love
And I'll pawn you my gold diamond ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that you love me again
Instrumental break
Take back all the gifts you have given
But a ring and a lock of your hair
And a card with your picture upon it
It's a face that is false but it's fair
Oh I'll pawn you my gold watch and chain love
And I'll pawn you my gold diamond ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that you love me again
Instrumental break
Tell me why that you do not love me
Tell me why that your smile is not bright
Tell me why you have grown so coldhearted
Is there no kiss for me love tonight
Oh I'll pawn you my gold watch and chain love
And I'll pawn you my gold diamond ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that you love me again

Oh I'll pawn you my gold watch and chain love
And I'll pawn you my gold diamond ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that you love me again <start> 
It's been a long dark night
And I've been a waitin' for the morning
It's been a long hard fight
But I see a brand new day a dawning
I've been looking for the sunshine
'Cause I ain't seen it in so long
But everything's gonna work out just fine
Everything's gonna be all right
That's been all wrong
'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
And everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay
It's been a long long time
Since I've known the taste of freedom
And those clinging vines
That had me bound well I don't need 'em
'Cause I am strong and I can prove it
And I got my dreams to see me through
It's just a mountain I can move it
And with faith enough there's nothing I can't do
And I can see the light of a clear blue morning
And I can see the light of brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
And everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a brand new day
Yes I can see the light of a clear blue morning
And everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay
'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
Yes I can see the light of a clear blue morning
Everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay
I can see the light
I can see the light
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right <start> I don't love you anymore not the way I did before
And since you've found somebody new I think it's best
I don't cry and walk the floor I don't love you anymore
The trouble is I don't love you any less
I don't love you anymore for I've got no more love to give
You drained my heart of all its love with every sweet caress
I keep saying o'er and o'er I don't love you anymore
The trouble is I don't love you any less
 piano 
I held you close to me one time kissed your lips and called you mine
Then another came and warmed you with his touch
I cried as you walked out the door I don't love you anymore
That's the truth but I still love you just as much
I don't love you anymore... <start> The sun is out
The sky is blue
There's not a cloud
To spoil the view
But it's rainin
Raining in my heart
The weatherman says fine today
He doesn't know you have gone away
It's rainin
Raining in my heart
Oh misery misery
What's gonna become of me
I tell my blues
They mustn't show
But soon my tears
Are bound to flow
Cause it's rainin
Raining in my heart
Oh misery misery
What's gonna become of me
The sun is out
The sky is blue
There's not a cloud
To spoil the view
But it's rainin
Raining in my heart <start> A bunch of old cowboys are making their noise
At the rodeos across the land
They're all over forty but let me tell you Lordy
They're still tough rodeo hands
Well their age may be showing and their gray hairs a growing
And they ought to be a packing it in but there's Broncs to be rode
And steers to be throwed and the wild bunch is riding again
The wild bunch is riding again
Yeah they may be getting gray and they may be getting old
And the years and the miles have taken their toll
And the old arthritis is a setting in but the wild bunch is riding again
The wild bunch is riding again
They ain't getting any younger but they still got a hunger
For the glory and a chance to win
Though their hides getting wrinkled and their body's all crinkled
They're as wild as they've ever been
They know they ought to hang it up but Lord it's mighty tough
Just to leave it all in yesterday they're gonna keep on a riding
Gonna keep on trying oh they ain't gonna fade away
They ain't gonna fade away
Yeah they may be getting gray and they may be getting old
And the years and the miles have taken their toll
And the old arthritis is a setting in but the wild bunch is riding again
The wild bunch is riding again
Yeah they may be getting gray and they may be getting old
And the years and the miles have taken their toll
And the old arthritis is a setting in but the wild bunch is riding again
The wild bunch is riding again the wild bunch is riding again <start> Don't know what it is but I kinda like it
Maybe it's love
Maybe it's not
Don't know what it is but I kinda like it
Kinda like it a lot
She slid across the front seat
Unlocked the door for me
She was waiting in the car
I couldn't wait to get in
First night going so right
Put her pretty little hand in mine
All I knew it felt so good
What I was feeling right then
Drove down to golf links road
Pulled out on the th hole
Slow danced on the green grass
Stole a little kiss
Closed her eyes and held me tight
Felt the wheels spinning in my mind
When I kissed her again she said I could get used to this
Little more than I want to
Little more than I should
Little more than I ought to
But damn it feels so good
Oh damn you feel so good <start> Don't tell him that I'm still crying
Don't let him know that losin' him was more than I could stand
I'm glad you hear that both of them are happy
I hope he's finally found what he never found with me
Tell him that you saw me and be sure to say hello
But promise me one thing before you go
Don't tell him that I'm still crying
Don't let him know that there's no way my broken heart can mend
Don't tell him that I'm still crying
Don't let him know that losin' him was more than I could stand
Don't tell him that I'm still crying... <start> Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love my own.
Broken song empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love my own.
Broken song empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose my Rose of San Antone <start> Last thing I remember was saying
Hey y'all watch this. Next thing I know I'm walking toward this light
When a voice from out of nowhere asked this question.
Garth what did you love most in your past life
Well I said it had to be between cowgirls and horses.
And as I wondered which one that I would settle on
The voice said May you be happy with your answer.
I said What answer He said Watch this. And I was gone.
Chorus
Now I'm back as a cowgirl's saddle
Heaven on Earth for all eternity
Forever in between
Every cowboy's dream
Riding horses holding rodeo queens
Sew me show me throw me in the pickup
Take me break me make me what you need
It's safe to say we're made for one another
And you'll never fall if you just stick with me
Fit me sit me get me how you want me
Wrap me strap me slap me on your steed
Can't believe I'm out here flying with an angel
Oh this afterlife's sure looking up for me
Chorus
Loping roping hoping that you're happy
Racing placing chasing all your dreams
Makes me think if I'd lived life a little better
Would I've come back as a pair of cowgirl jeans
Chorus
Every cowboy's dream
You know just what I mean
Riding horses holding rodeo queens <start> There's a darkness upon me that's flooded in light
In the fine print they tell me what's wrong and what's right
And it comes in black and it comes in white
And I'm frightened by those that don't see it
When nothing is owed or deserved or expected
And your life doesn't change by the man that's elected
If you're loved by someone you're never rejected
Decide what to be and go be it
There was a dream and one day I could see it
Like a bird in a cage I broke in
And demanded that somebody free it
And there was a kid with a head full of doubt
So I'll scream 'til I die
And the last of those bad thoughts are finally out
There's a darkness upon you that's flooded in light
And in the fine print
They tell you what's wrong and what's right
And it flies by day and it flies by night
And I'm frightened by those who don't see it
There was a dream and one day I could see it
Like a bird in a cage I broke in
And demanded that somebody free it
And there was a kid with a head full of doubt
So I'll scream til I die
And the last of those bad thoughts are finally out
There was a dream and one day I could see it
Like a bird in a cage I broke in
And demanded that somebody free it
And there was a kid with a head full of doubt
So I'll scream 'til I die
And the last of those bad thoughts are finally out
There's a darkness upon me that's flooded in light
In the fine print they tell me what's wrong and what's right
There's a darkness upon me that's flooded in light
And I'm frightened by those who don't see it <start> The cattle are prowlin' and the coyotes are howlin'
Way out where the doggies bawl
Where spurs are jinglin' my cowboy is singin'
His lonesome cattle call
He rides in the sun till his day's work is done
And he rounds up the cattle each fall
Hmm singin' his cattle call
For hours he will ride on the range far and wide
When the night wind blows up a squall
His heart is a feather in all kinds of weather
He sings his cattle call
He's brown as a berry from ridin' the prairie
As he rounds up the cattle each fall
Hmm singin' his cattle call <start> Way down in the state of Georgia
Through the swamps and the everglades
There's a big hole in Tiger Mountain
God help the man who gets lost in Miller's Cave
I had a girl in Waycross Georgia
But she had unfaithful ways
She made me feel like I wasn't wanted
Like the bats and the bears in Miller's Cave
I caught her out one Sunday morning
With a man they call big Dave
He's the meanest man in the state of Georgia
I'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave
I said you'll pay both you and David.
I'm gonna see you in your grave.
They laughed at me and then I shot 'em
I took their cheating scheming bones to Miller's Cave <start> Born in the heat of the desert
My mother died giving me life
Deprived of the love of a father
Blamed for the loss of his wife
You know Lord I've been in a prison
For something that I've never done
It's been one hill after another
But I've climbed them all one by one
But this time Lord you gave me a mountain
A mountain I may never climb
And is isn't a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time
My woman tired of the hardships
Tired of the grief and the strife
So tired of working for nothing
Tired of being my wife
She took my one ray of sunshine
She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy
So this time Lord you gave me a mountain
A mountain I may never climb
And is isn't a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time <start> The first sound I heard was a woman's cry
The first word I learned to utter was goodbye
Forgive me if I'm wrong in what I do to you
While passin' through passin' through
Happiness for me cannot be found but yet I still search from town to town
No offence but I don't think I'll find it here with you
Goodbye babe just passin' through
Passin' through your life like a ragin' river
No woman needs or can hold the love I give her
Please understand I can't control these things I do
While passin' through passin' through
What was that did you say you thought you loved me
That's too bad girl cause if you really do
You'll just awaken with the dawn and find your love has flown
Like an old wild goose passin' through
Passin' through your life like a ragin' river
Like a cold north wind jus a passin' through
Goodbye babe passin' through <start> You never cease to amaze me
You can still make me crazy
Baby you can turn me on with just your eyes
You're just so darn appealing
Ooh you stir up sexy feelings
Every man in the room would love to try you on for size
Baby wait 'til I get you home
Wait 'til I get you alone
Wait 'til I get my hands on you
Wait 'til I get you home sweet baby
Wait 'til I get you home
Oh baby you still make me
Feel feelin's that can take me
To places where I've never been before
Well honey I've got a feelin'
We'll make some shadows on the ceilin'
Tonight by candlelight behind closed doors
Baby wait 'til I get you home
Wait 'til I get you alone
Wait 'til I get my hands on you
Wait 'til I get you home sweet baby
Wait 'til I get you home
Your lovin' gets better each time we're together
It's always exciting and new
Each time we discover we're still like young lovers
It's always been magic with you
Baby wait 'til I get you home
You just wait 'til I get you alone
Wait 'til I get my hands on you
Wait 'til I get you home sweet darlin'
Wait 'til I get you home
Wait 'til I get you alone
Wait 'til I get my hands on you
Wait 'til I get you home sweet baby
Wait 'til I get you home sweet darlin'
Wait 'til I get you home
You just wait you just wait
I can't wait I can't wait <start> All your life you've lived a sinner the bright way you've never trod
You're drifting away you're drifting away
When you come to cross the river and you haven't met with God
You're drifting away you're drifting away
You're drifting away you're drifting away
On down the dark river I'm sorry to say
You're drifting away you're drifting away
Don't wait too long to let Jesus hear you pray
You won't give up your earthly treasures to enter the promised land
You're drifting away you're drifting away
You can hear Jesus callin' but you won't accept his hand
You're drifting away you're drifting away
You're drifting away you're drifting away
On down the dark river I'm sorry to say
You're drifting away you're drifting away
Don't wait too long to let Jesus hear you pray
When you come to cross the river Jesus won't give the command
You're drifting away you're drifting away
And that dark rollin' river takes you to the sinkin' sand
You're drifting away you're drifting away
You're drifting away you're drifting away
On down the dark river I'm sorry to say
You're drifting away you're drifting away
Don't wait too long to let Jesus hear you pray <start> Everything I touch turns to ashes
So I wouldn't dare lay a hand on you
I've never had much luck with passion
But I can tell you're wantin' me too
Every time you look my way I shiver
I'm havin' a hard time keepin' my cool
I see the message your eyes deliver
Or is it just the smoke in the room
I feel the heat
It's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
I feel the sweat
Rollin' down the nape of my neck
You're burnin' me up
Just look at this ragin' fire you started
Don't stop now
Baby you're cold hearted
Well I've always been a little bit reckless
Oh and now here I am playin' with fire
With every sweet kiss from your red lips
You make my temperature rise
I feel the heat
It's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
I feel the sweat
Rollin' down the nape of my neck
You're burnin' me up
Just look at this ragin' fire you started
Don't stop now
Baby that's cold hearted
I feel the heat
It's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
I feel the sweat
Rollin' down the nape of my neck
Oh you're burnin' me up
Oh look at this ragin' fire you started
Don't stop now
Baby that's cold hearted <start> 
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers toils and snares
I have already come
Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
Amazing grace oh amazing grace
That saved a wretch like me
Oh amazing grace amazing grace <start> I CAN MAKE IT WITH YOU
WITH THE POZOSECO SINGERS
WRITER CHIP TAYLOR
When the world was on my shoulders
And all hope for tomorrow was gone
You took my hand and baby you made me see
There's a future for me
And I can make it with you baby
I can make it with you
I can make it with you by my side
And when life had lost it's meaning
When my dreams had been shattered by time
You touched my hand and baby
You made me see
There's a future for me
Remember when I was down
Was lost but now I've been found
And I can make it with you baby
I can make it with you <start> I've got my angel on my mind that's why I'm walkin'
There's such an ache in this old heart now I ain't talkin'
The little hand that held mine tight just waved goodbye tonight
I've got her sweet love on my mind that's why I'm walkin'
With an old love on your mind life's not worth livin'
I breathe her name with every breath I'm breathin'
Why could I never see how much she meant to me
I've got her sweet love on my mind that's why I'm walkin'
With an old love on your mind...
I've got my angel on my mind that's why I'm walkin' <start> Please release me let me go for I don't love you anymore
To waste our lives would be a sin release and let me love again
I have found a new love dear and I'll always want her near
Her lips are warm while yours are cold release me my darling let me go
Please release me can't you see you'd be a fool to cling to me
To live a lie would bring us shame release me and let me love again
Release me and let me love again <start> Comancheros are B takin' this E land
The Comancheros are B takin' this E land.
E Paul Regret from A New Orleans
A E fast man with a B gun
He E didn't want to go he A had to run
When he E shot down the B judge's E son
Yes he shot judge B  E son.
With the dark of night he left that town
Never to return again
With a oneway ticket at the end of the line
He was told by a stranger man
The Comancheros are takin' this land.
B Then the Comancheros came aE ridin' through the night
B Stealin' and akillin' takin' E ever'thing in sight
B Nothin' left behind but the E blood and the sand
The Comancheros are B takin' this E land
The Comancheros are B takin' this E land.
I'll cover every inch of the ground where I stand
I'd die before I'd run
I'm not afraid of any living man
And here I'll make my stand
With a gun I'll make my stand.
He rode into the Comanchero town
Like a wild man on the run
Before he'd leave they'd all be dead
They'd die by his blazin' gun
They died by his blazin' gun. <start> Why can't you just believe in me
Not everyone is the enemy
I'm trying hard I swear I am
I'm doin' the best I can
But I'm Broken
Broken
I'm wagin' war up in my head
Last time I loved it 'bout left me dead
And you're no better off 'cause you got burned too
By someone you thought you really knew
Now you're Broken
Broken
You hold a little back in case I leave
That way I can't take all of you
But that guarded part is the part I need
So I don't feel like I'm a fool
Last time that I let somebody in
It really hurt me but that was then
So here we are just you and me
The sum of all our injuries
Don't try to push me 'cause I might break
Not sure how much of this I can take
So if you otta go well that's alright too
Guess there's not a lot that we can do
'Cause we're Broken
Broken
You hold a little back in case I leave
That way I can't take all of you
But that guarded part is the part I need
So I don't feel like I'm a fool
Yeah we're Broken
Baby we're Broken <start> We started in the morning carried well into the night
Throwing dirty dishes with all our might
Sad commentary on a marriage that has failed
I'm at home getting hammered while she's out getting nailed
Police pulled into my trailer park
Domestic violence cost Incomprehensible after dark
Late night with her boss says they're trying to make a sale
I'm at home getting hammered while she's out getting nailed
I'm at home drinking whiskey in my easy chair
Watching Jerry Lawler pulling Andy Kauffmans hair
Had a suspicion so I opened up her mail
I'm at home getting hammered while she's out getting nailed
She used to bring me beer and love all over me
Right before I went on disability
My wiggler ain't so straight I got whiskey dick
She don't perk it up 'cause 'cause her ankles got so thick <start> She's sun and rain she's fire and ice
A little crazy but it's nice
And when she gets mad you best leave her alone
'Cause she'll rage just like a river
Then she'll beg you to forgive her
She's every woman that I've ever known
She's so New York and then L.A.
And every town along the way
She's every place that I've never been
She's making love on rainy nights
She's a stroll through Christmas lights
And she's everything I want to do again
It needs no explanation
'Cause it all makes perfect sense
When it comes down to temptation
She's on both sides of the fence
No it needs no explanation
'Cause it all makes perfect sense
When it comes down to temptation
She's on both sides of the fence <start> People laugh and love and cry and I'm still missing you
The paper boy still comes around 
Just like he used to do 
But he's a little taller now and I'm still missing you
The leaves are piled against the fence 
The sky is hazy blue 
There's talk about an early snow and I'm still missing you and I'm still missing you
The swirlin' winds of time bring many changes

But with me they only blow across the surface of my heart
And they can't cool this memory of you that burns so deep inside me
Dick and Jane came by today 
Their baby's almost due 
People laugh and love and cry and I'm still missing you and I'm still missing you <start> Chorus
I've been higher than the high sierra
Lower than death valley must be
I've been right mostly wrong
Wrong about you right about me
The way I feel can't explain
So much passion turned to pain
The sun still shines most of the time
Did you know the sun shines when it rains
Chorus
I've been cussed and I've been praised
And I've been nothing these days
But I'll come back time will see
If I'm wrong about you right about me <start> It's too soon to know if I can forget her
My heart's been broken into many pieces
And it's too soon to know
Time passes slow will I ever know
If I can forget her and not let her show
But it's too soon to know
News travels fast when a love affair ends
People keep asking what happened to them
But it's too soon to know...
My heart's been broken into many pieces
And it's too soon to know <start> Down here on the farm the weather gets messy laying around with nothing to do
When you went away you took my cow Bessie I miss her darling more than I miss you
You took off your leg your wig and your eyeglass
And you shoud've seen the look on my face
I wanted to kiss I wanted to hug you but you were scattered all over the place
Where oh where are you tonight why did you leave me here all alone
I searched the world over and I thought I'd found true love
You met another and  you were gone
I know that you loved me here's my way of knowing
The proofs hanging out right there on the line
When I see the snow and feel the wind blowing
Your nighties hugging them long johns of mine
The noises you made at our supper table your habits my dear were surely absurd
But how many times do I have to tell you soup is a dish to be seen and not heard
Where oh where...
Remember you phoned me a sobbin' and cryin'
The dog bit your maw and drug her around
You said she looked pale and thought she was dying
I said don't worry I'll buy a new hound
I had six kids and you had eleven and we had eight more and they grew like flowers
I wish you'd come back without you ain't heaven
Cause your kids and my kids are beatin' up ours
Where oh where... <start> Written by billy burnette.
Oh susan I'm losin' control
I don't know what to do
'cause this feelin' I keep feelin'
About you sue

Well I got you on my mind
You got me anytime
You got me in your hip pocket

And I'm bound to go on ridin'
I've got one more silver dollar
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me Lord
I ain't' gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider
I don't own the clothes I'm wearin'
Some old bed I'll soon be sharin'
I got one more silver dollar
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me Lord
I ain't' gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider
I got past the point of carin'
And the road goes on forever
I got one more silver dollar
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me Lord
I ain't' gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me Lord
I ain't' gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me Lord
I ain't' gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me Lord
I ain't' gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider <start> There's a spot in me heart which no colleen may own
There's a depth in me soul never sounded or known
There's a place in my memory my life that you fill
 no one ever will
Sure I love the dear silver that shines in your hair
And the brow that's all furrowed and wrinkled with care
I kiss the dear fingers so toilworn for me
Oh God bless you and keep you Mother machree
Every sorrow or care in the dear days gone by
Twas made bright by the light of the smile in your eye
Like a candle that's set in a window at night
 and guided me right
Sure I love the dear silver <start> A boy loved a little girl a long time ago
But he was shy and too afraid to tell her so
When he learned to write the first thing that he did
Was sendin' note to her and this is what it said
Remember the M remember the E put them together and remember me
Cause whyOyou knows you know who never love anyone else but you
The dreams were too big for my love to fill
She wanted the rich boy who lived upon the hill
I told her that his gold and fancy limousine
Could never bring the happiness that true love brings
Remember the M remember the E
In the morning mail I got a faded note
The tear stained piece of paper the first words that I wrote
There was no other message there didn't have to be
She left my own words tell me she's in love with me
Remember the M remember the E <start> Take Me As I Am 
Written by Boudleaux Bryant
Gene Watson
Why do you always try to make me over
Take me as i am or let me go
White lilies never grow in fields of clover
Take me as i am or let me go.
You're tryin' to reshape me in a mold love
In the image of someone you used to know
I won't be astandin' for an old love
So take me as i am or let me go.
You're tryin' to reshape me in a mold love
In the image of someone you used to know
I won't be astandin' for an old love
Take me as i am or let me go.
Ho Just take me as i am or let me go. <start> Old beatup suitcase on the platform a train ticket in my hand
And a train just arrivin' that'll take me as far as fourteen dollars can
But a train won't take me far enough it never has before
I gotta find how far a memory reaches and then go one mile more
I ain't never found a mountain that was high enough or a hole too dark and deep
Cause if I lose her mem'ry in a bottle of wine then she'll find me in my sleep
 ac.guitar 
I think of me and that old suitcase the places we both been
All the rails and jails and the cheap hotels and now we're gone again
And when I'll ride my money up and they won't let me ride no more
Then I'll wait by the track for a slow movin' freight and watch for an open door
I ain't never found a mountain...
Then she'll find me in my sleep then she'll find me in my sleep <start> Oh I've been stumblin' through the darkness
Tryin' to feel the ground beneath my feet
Afraid of movin' much in any direction
Stuck where the past and the future meet
But I fin'lly got my first good look
A little fire was all it too
An' as the flames grew brighter
I saw everything that I'd missed
Once you get your courage up
You light a match an' your eyes adjust
It's amazing what a man can see
By the light of a burnin' bridge
An' there were things I saw that I'm not proud of
Things that I'd do diff'rent now from then
But when I really make myself get honest
It's over and I can't go back again
'Cause I fin'lly got my first good look
A little fire was all it took
An' as the flames grew brighter
I saw everything that I'd missed
Once you get your courage up
You light a match an' your eyes adjust
It's amazing what a man can see
By the light of a burnin' bridge
It sure is hard to let go and to leave the past behind
But there ain't no other way that you can find some peace of mind
When I fin'lly got my first good look
A little fire was all it took
An' as the flames grew brighter
I saw everything that I'd missed
Once you get your courage up
You light a match an' your eyes adjust
It's amazing what a man can see
By the light of a burnin' bridge
It's amazing what a man can see
By the light of a burnin' bridge <start> We know it's wrong to let this fire burn between us
We've got to stop this wild desire in you and in me
So we'll let the flame burn once again until the thrill is gone
Then we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning
We're two people caught up in the flame that has to die out soon
I didn't mean to start this fire and neither did you
So tonight when you hold me tight we'll let the fire burn on
And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning
Each time we meet we both agree it's for the last time
But out of your arms I'm out of my mind
So we'll taste the thrill of stolen love tonight until the dawning
And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning
We're two people caught up in the flame that has to die out soon
I didn't mean to start this fire and neither did you
So tonight when you hold me tight we'll let the fire burn on
And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning <start> We had promised to be wed when we said goodbye that night
While the moon and stars were shining from the sky
For our hearts were full of joy and the future looked so bright
I never thought that we were sayin' our last goodbye
I was only leaving you for just a little while
To find a home where we'd be happy by and by
Then you kissed me with a smile and you said you'll wait for me
I never thought that we were sayin' our last goodbye
It was only one short year till I found a little place
And started back to you to hear your happy sigh
I was thinking only of the smile upon your face
I never thought that we had said our last goodbye
All the story that was told when I knocked upon your door
Broke my heart in two and how it made me cry
For that told me you had gone and didn't love me anymore
Then I knew that we had said our last goodbye <start>  every single day
If I bought a flower for each happy hour
That you and your love have made life sweet
Millions of roses millions of roses would lie at your feet
For each time you hold me each love word you told me
If I work to bring the rose in blue
Millions of roses millions of roses would fill every room
What a way to show you all you mean to me
More than this I owe you for each memory <start> Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy Lord
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
Feelin good was easy Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee <start> Some glad morning when this life is o'er I'll fly away
To a home on God's celestial shore I'll fly away
I'll fly away oh Glory I'll fly away when I'll die hallelujah by and by I'll fly away
When the shadows of this life outgrown I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison bars have flown I'll fly away
I'll fly away oh Glory I'll fly away when I'll die hallelujah by and by I'll fly away
 ac.guitar 
Just a few more weary days and then I'll fly away
To a land where joy shall never end I'll fly away
I'll fly away oh Glory I'll fly away when I'll die hallelujah by and by I'll fly away
When I'll die hallelujah by and by I'll fly away <start> Come they told me parum pum pum pum

Me and my drum <start> She goes walking through my mind
I've tried to drive away her memory but each night it comes back to torture me
Cause once again there she is right on time
When she goes walking through my mind
She goes walking through my mind tearing out a little each time
Her footsteps are getting louder all the time when she goes walking through my mind
I've tried to drown my thoughts in the wine
But a glass full of heartaches all I found
Cause once again there she is right on time and she goes walking through my mind
She goes walking through my mind <start> The cattle are prowlin'
The coyotes are howlin'
Way out where the doggies roam.
Where spurs are a jinglin'
And the cowboy is singin'
His lonesome cattle call.
He rides in the sun
'Til his days work is done.
And rounds up the cattle each fall.
Singin' his cattle call.
For hours he would ride.
On the range far and wide.
When the night wind blows up and slow.
His heart is a feather.
In all kinds of weather.
He sings his cattle call. <start> I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time
But that was before I met you
I never saw one that I wanted for mine
But that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you
I thought I'd stay single always be free
But that was before I met you
I said that no sweet thang could ever hold me
But that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you
That was before I met you <start> WHY DO I PUT UP WITH YOU
WITH BETTIE HUSKY

' Johnny Bienstock Music BMI
I don't know why I put up with you I put up with you and the little things you do
I don't know why I put up with you I put up with you the way I do
You bring the kitchen to the bedroom while you're readin'
And I wake up with cheese and crackers in my hair
And when I go to take a shower I start screamin'
Cause I get lost in your nylon jungle there
Oh I don't know why I put up with you I put up with you the way I do
You throw your clothes around the room in no directions
And then you wonder why my work is never done
The little workshop in the basement never seen you
I tell myself if the TV program's coming on
I don't know why I put up with you I put up with you the way I do
I don't know why I put up with you I put up with you the way I do
At two o'clock I call and say we're goin' dancin'
To give you time to make your face and fix your hair
And eight o'clock we're runnin' in and out of dress shops
Because you say you haven't got a thing to wear
I don't know why I put up with you I put up with you the way I do
On Friday night you promised me that we'll go shopping
Because on Saturdays the sale is going off
But in the morning you say honey I'm so sorry
I have forgot that today I'm playin' golf
I don't know why I put up with you I put up with you and the little things you do
I don't know why I put up with you I put up with you the way I do <start> Girl I swear
I get scared looking in your eyes
Start thinking about where I'd be now
If I wasn't with you tonight
I've done a lot of crazy things
But you saved me and you reeled me in
There ain't no doubt I'd take us right now
Over me back when
A lot of beer got drank
A lot of hell got raised
A lot of nights got long but that was long
Before I saw your face
Now baby I'm holding on
To what I never wanna lose
I took a few wrong turns
Down a couple back roads
But wound up where I was supposed to
Making my way making my way to you
Yeah making my way making my way to you
Now I know why all those wrong ones didn't work out
It's easy to see but hard to believe
That I got my arms around
My forever I coulda never
Dreamed it up this good
Ain't it funny how things work out
Better than you thought they would
Back when a lot of beer got drank
A lot of hell got raised
A lot of nights got long but that was long
Before I saw your face
Now baby I'm holding on
To what I never wanna lose
I took a few wrong turns down a couple back roads
But wound up where I was supposed to
Making my way to you
I didn't know what I was looking for
No I didn't have a clue
Next thing I know
I'm thanking the lord for everything I went through
Making my way making my way to you
While I was makng my way
Making my way to you yeah
A lot of beer got drank
A lot of hell got raised
A lot of nights got long
But that was longbefore I saw your face
Now baby I'm holding on to what I never wanna lose
I took a few wrong turns down a couple back roads
But wound up where I was supposed to
Making my way making my way to you
Baby I've been making my way
Making my way to you

A lot of hell got raised

If heaven's not my home then Lord what will I do
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
This world is not my home I'm just passing through
My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
Oh Lord you know...
 guitar 
They're all expecting me and that's one thing I know
My Saviour pardoned me and now I onward go
I know he date me through so I am weak and poor
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
Oh Lord you know... <start> I've got bills to pay tax man on my tail
Just keep prayin' that the check's in the mail
There are times it seems every thing's lost
And I'm moaning I'm tossed and I see
Between the river and the ravens I'm fit
Between oblivion and places I'm there
So Father give me faith providence and grace
Between the river and the ravens I'm fit
Sweet deliver oh You lift up my head
And lead me in Your way
I've grown sick and tired of trying to stand still
Time to let the wind pull me where it will
Throw myself into the will of the wait
I can never be great 'til we're free
Between the river and the ravens I'm fit
Between oblivion and places I'm there
So Father give me faith providence and grace
Between the river and the ravens I'm fit
Sweet deliver oh You lift up my head
And lead me in Your way
Although I'm walking through the valley of the shadow of death
Evil's all around it's coming from the right and the left
Trust that I will see the glory above
Oh Your banner of love flies over me
Between the river and the ravens I'm fit
Between oblivion and places I'm there
So Father give me faith providence and grace
Between the river and the ravens I'm fit
Sweet deliver oh You lift up my head
And lead me in Your way
Between the river and the ravens I'm fit
Sweet deliver oh You lift up my head
And lead me in Your way <start> Anytime you're feelin' lonely
Anytime you're feelin' blue
Anytime you feel down hearted
That will prove your love for me is true
Chorus
Anytime you're thinkin' 'bout me
That's the time I'll think of you
Anytime you say you want me back again
That's the time I'll come back home to you
Anytime your world is lonely
And you find true friends are few
Anytime you see a rainbow
That will be a sign the storm is through
Anytime will be the right time
Anytime at all will do
Anytime you're sure you want only my love
That's the time I'll come back home to you <start> In your cup holder was some loose change
He got your cellphone on vibrate
I wish you were on it
There's a road you got to take to get to my place
Faded up yellow lines on two lanes
I wish you were on it
I could use a little Henny right now
Rushin' over runnin' into my house
Just want you back tears rollin' down your face
Drop your keys on my hardwood floor
Kiss me like you never kissed me before
And girl I swear that's all that it would take
And you know the way
I wish you were on it
There's a parking spot under the sycamore
And them flood lights on the front porch
I wish you were on it
And through the front door of the stair case
There's a floor post down the hall way
I wish you were on it
I could use a little Henny right now
Rushin' over runnin' into my house
Just want you back tears rollin' down your face
Drop your keys on my hardwood floor
Kiss me like you never kissed me before
And girl I swear that's all that it would take
And you know the way
I wish you were on it
There's a heart that needs to unbreak
And you know the way
I could use a little Henny right now
Rushin' over runnin' into my house
Just want you back tears rollin' down your face
Drop your keys on my hardwood floor
Kiss me like you never kissed me before
And girl I swear that's all that it would take
And you know the way
I wish you were on it <start> Saw a man out on the street today his whole life in a box
Someone must'a loved him once right now he just feels lost
I don't know where he's headed Can't tell where he's been
God I wish that I could say to him you can start your life again
If you can find somebody
You can love more than you
You gotta hold on hang on whatever you do
And when it feels like you've got nothin'
And your world is all but stopped
You still have everything when love is all you've got
A family prayin' beneath a bridge I don't know how they do it
Their shoes and clothes were all but gone
But their faith'll get 'em through it
Oh you know there's somethin' special about a mother and a father
Who can teach their kids to love when others might not bother
So when you find somebody
You can love more than you
When the rain stops raining and the sun shines through
And when it feels like you've got nothing
And your world is all but stopped
You'll still have everything when love is all you've got
Maybe there's a miracle your name's been written on
Maybe it's been standin' right beside you all along
So when you find somebody 
You can love more than you. 
You gotta hold on  hang on  whatever you do
And when it feels like you've got nothin'
And your world is all but stopped
You still have everything. You still have everything
When Love is all you've got <start> Where have you been
My long lost friend
It's good to see you again.
Come and sit for a while
I've missed your smile
Today the past is goodbye.
Time can't erase
A lover's embrace.
Can't you hear it calling
A new day dawning
You were longing to find.
Love's taken you far
Away from my heart
And I've been here all alone.
Have your eyes failed to find
What took you from mine
A vision that's faded through time
But you sailed away
A fine summer's day
Cause you heard it calling
A new day dawning
You were longing to find.
There is a way to make you stay.
Darlin' don't turn away
Don't doubt your heart
and keep us apart
I'm right where you are
Stay
There is a way to make you stay.
Darlin' don't turn away.
Don't doubt your heart
and keep us apart
I'm right where you are
Stay <start> There's something dark inside of me.
There is a ghost in this machine.
There is a giant jagged hole.
Twists and rips through my soul.
Like the roots of some old retched tree.
There's something dark inside of me.
There's something haunting all my love.
There's nothing good I'm thinking of.
Still I'm gilded and groomed gliding into the room.
Saying such bold and beautiful things.
There's something dark inside of me.
There's something rumbling in my mind.
Secrets that you weren't meant to find.
You thought you knew me so well
I will see you in hell
Before I let you live to tell what you've seen
There's something dark inside of me.
I need someone to set me free.
So I call out your name
But you seem so far away.
And anyway who could save one like me
Cause' there's something dark inside of me. <start> The Arizona sun looks like a ruby in the sky
And when the desert wind blows like a friend
It's enough to make you high
I am so far away from Eastern Standard time
But I miss you babe
I hope you're doing fine
Well I found a job it's nothing much but at least it pays the rent
The boss is nice but his wife but she only works weekends
How are things in Charleston is there someone in your life
Guess I should ask
I hope you're doing fine
We were making plans together not so long ago
Thought we could see forever from that Carolina coast
But things change everything changes
Now the moon is up and the stars are out
Yeah it's quite a sight to see
It's times like this oh how I wish you were still next to me
Maybe our paths baby will cross somewhere down the line
Who's to say
I just hope you're doing fine
I miss you so
I hope you're doing fine
That's all for now
I hope you're doing fine <start> So I looked into a dream and found you there
For the laughter in your eyes I looked everywhere
Spent a long time searching and the vision almost died
When I saw your face I cried
So I took out all the prayers I'd said for you
And I lay them at your feet and they all come true
Then I felt the tingle of a turning tide
And I thanked the Lord I cried
And I cried in recognition of the fact that my convictions
After all this time had proven to be true
All my tears were shed in secret in the chamber of a heart
That had persisted in believing I'd find you
From the gardens of my soul I picked a rose
And I listened while my heart started to compose
A song of hope unending many oceans wide
And when you sang my song I cried <start> I turned around
Before I could run I found you already settled down in the back of my mind
I know this is just a customary feelin'
The moon is our deceiver that will leave you running blind
Your heart is pullin'
If I didn't know any better
I'd be fallin'
Deeper and deeper it's true
I'd hear it callin'
If I didn't know any better
And I'd be in love with you
Didn't want to
Look in the eyes of the one that I would be drawn to
I'm a moth lost in a fire
And I know this is just a beautiful illusion
A case of the confusion between love and desire
Your heart is pullin'
If I didn't know any better
I'd be fallin'
Deeper and deeper it's true
I'd hear it callin'
If I didn't know any better
And I'd be in love
When the flame burns out
And fine'ly settles down
And you'd forget I ever came around
Your heart is pullin'
If I didn't know any better
I'd be fallin'
Deeper and deeper it's true
I'd hear it callin'
If didn't know any better
And I'd be in love with you
I turned around
Before I could run I found you already settled down in the back of my mind <start> Lovin' you lovin' you
Seems that's all I ever want to do
You went and turned your back on me
I packed my bags and had to leave
I can't believe I'm still in love with you
The hardest thing I've tried to do
Is try and keep from loving you
I don't think it's ever gonna be
You have got my heart and soul
Wish that you were mine to hold
Even though I know you don't love me
I close my eyes and all I see
Are memories of when you loved me
Your heart is locked and I don't have the key
So I'll keep tryin' to forget
Maybe some day time will let
My heart heal and once again be free <start> Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling can you picture this
Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat the heat between me
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world so cold
Maybe I'm just too demanding
And maybe I'm just like my father too bold
And maybe I'm just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like when doves cry
Touch if you will my stomach
See how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you even doves have pride
Just leave me standing
Alone in a world so cold
Maybe I'm just too demanding
And maybe I'm just like my father too bold
And maybe I'm just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like when doves cry
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world so cold
Maybe I'm just too demanding
And maybe I'm just like my father too bold
And maybe I'm just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other
But this is what it sounds like when doves cry <start> It's only three steps to the phone I could say we're just three steps apart
I could say it but I'd be so wrong for I'm millions of miles from your heart
It's only eight steps to the door that you entered so many times
But you'll never walk in anymore for I'm millions of miles from your mind
We were very happy and you loved me me 'till we happened alone
Then our world of love fell apart
Now it's only three steps to the phone but I'm millions of miles from your heart
We were very happy <start> Put me on a train
Put me on a oneway runway skyhigh aeroplane
Girl I really need a change get away see the smile on your face
Find me a row boat let it flow on a river pointed your way I'm thinking let's be spontaneous
All I'm saying is
It's a long way from here to California and I
Must say I need you around and I'm
Not afraid to meet you in the middle of a nowhere anybody's heard of town
In a little cabin up in the mountains or a
Cabana on a beach somewhere
All I know is you're not here
And all that means is I've gotta get there
Yeah
I gotta gotta get there I gotta get there yeah
You took me in your arms
'Cause for a long while these miles been keeping me from where you are

Oh I gotta get there I gotta get there yeah
Yeah I gotta gotta get there I gotta get there yeah <start> It ain't nothin' but a concrete jungle with people packed like sardines
Where everybody's tryin' to live beyond their means
Where all the natives hurry and scurry too and fro
And like a fleas on a puppy dog they got no place to go
I wouldn't live in New York City if they gave me the whole dang town
Talk about a bummer it's the biggest one around
Sodom and Gommorah was tame to what I found
I wouldn't live in New York City if they gave me the whole dang town
Well I ain't seen the sunshine since the day that I arrived
Cause brother I've been busy a tryin' to survive
Nobody knows you've been here till you're six feet under ground
Than you become a statistic if they remember to write you down <start> 
This country boy love is what you need
I'm in the rut baby you're my doe in heat
Let's make a bed with all these bags of feed
In the back of my truck
Yea I know just how to treat a girl

Take my old four wheeler for a whirl
Would you like that baby
If your can's running low on dip

All them city boys jealous of what they see
'Cause they ain't loving like that no
This country boy love is what you need
Like a  gauge pump can set you free
Once you taste these biscuits there so sweet

We can battle for a buck on our first date
Get some mud on the truck or go hunt snakes
You'll get chiggers on your legs but that's okay
I'll scratch 'em for you later ahh
I ain't got no candles or red wine
I got a beer and a catfish on the line
I pull him up spill the guts and then
We'll fry him up for supper
After that take my overalls off
But I'm leaving my boots on
This country boy love is what you need
We can knock them boots and yell yee yee
All the city boys jealous of what they see
'Cause they ain't loving like that no
This country boy love is what you need

He left me love enough to last a lifetime
A lifetime filled with loving memories
And so I have no reason to search for new love
Time could never take his love from me
And my mind is filled with memories sweet and tender
My heart is filled with love he left for me
And each thought of him just makes love grow sweeter
He left me love to last eternally
I just close my eyes and I still see him
And in dreams he loves me just like he used to do
He even wakes me with a tender kiss every mornin'
A kiss that lingers on my lips the whole day through
And my mind is filled with memories sweet and tender
And my heart is filled with love he left for me
And each thought of him just makes love grow sweeter
He left me love to last eternally
Oh yes he left me love <start> I've been your lover I've been your friend
I've been your faithful onewoman man
I've been your diamond in the rough
Now you say you wanna polish me up
Why why why do you wanna change me now
Ain't I the one you loved everything about
You might start missin' the old me around
So why why why do you wanna change me now
I remember you used to like
Walkin' with me on my wilder side
My kind of crazy turned you on
Do you really want that part of me gone
Why why why do you wanna change me now
Ain't I the one you loved everything about
You might start missin' the old me around
So why why why do you wanna change me now
Why why why
Ain't I the one
You might start missin'
Why why why do you wanna change me now
Ain't I the one you loved everything about
You might start missin' the old me around
So why why why do you wanna change me now <start> The streets are dark and empty and you walk them all alone
You think about your love affair and wonder what went wrong
You go to bed each night and pray you'll never see the dawn
Afraid of each tomorrow with its heartless cold unknown
And that's what it's like to be lonesome without your love it's such an empty world
And that's what it's like to be lonesome I know cause I'm a mighty lonesome girl
You search to find a tavern where the music's playing loud
You try to lose your heartache in the laughter of the crowd
But the happy couples make you think of things that might have been
And you have to fight the teardrops 'till you're by yourself again
And that's what it's like <start> Hang down your head Tom Dooley hang down your head and cry
Hang down your head Tom Dooley poor boy you're bound to die
I met her on the mountain and there I took her life
I met her on the mountain and stubbed her with my knife
Hang down your head Tom Dooley
This time tomorrow reckon where I'll be
If it hadn't been for Grayson I'd've been in Tennessee
Hang down your head Tom Dooley
This time tomorrow reckon where I'll be
In some lonesome valley a hangin' on a white oak tree
Hang down your head Tom Dooley <start> Mister Sandman bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him two lips like roses and clover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over
Sandman I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mister sandman bring me a dream
Bum bum bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum bum
Mister Sandman bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him the word that I'm not a rover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over
Sandman I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mister Sandman bring me a dream
Bum bum bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum bum
Mister Sandman bring us a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a come hither gleam
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace
Mister Sandman someone to hold
Would be so peachy before we're too old
So please turn on your magic beam
Mister Sandman bring us please please please
Mister Sandman bring us a dream <start> 
If I should stay
Well I would only be in your way
And so I'll go and yet I know
That I'll think of you each step of my way
And I will always love you
I will always love you
Bittersweet memories
That's all I have and all I'm taking with me
Goodbye oh please don't cry
'Cause we both know that I'm not
What you need
But I will always love you
I will always love you
And I hope life will treat you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
Oh I do wish you joy
And I wish you happiness
But above all this
I wish you love
I love you I will always love
I will always always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you <start> I turn to leave and you grab my sleeve
You say Why so fast can't we make this last
I say Ten years that's a mighty long time
It seems by now you could've made up your mind
You just want me to be a
Satellite to you sun
I want to fly free in heaven
Satellite you want me
To be caught in your gravity
You pull me in then you push away again
What scares you the most is when I get too close
And you're terrified of being alone
So you keep me hanging on
You just want me to be a
Satellite to you sun
I want to fly free in heaven
Satellite you want me
To be caught in your gravity
I will travel far to find the star
That every now and then will spin around me
Baby I refuse to be a
Satellite to you sun
I want to fly free in heaven
Satellite you want me
To be a victim of your gravity
Satellite to your sun
Satellite to your sun
Satellite no I'm not the one <start> Blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of glory divine
Air of salvation purchase of God born of his spirit washed in his blood
This is my story this is my song praising my Saviour all the day long
This is my story this is my song praising my Saviour all the day long
Perfect submition perfect delight visions of rapture now burst on my side
Angels descending bring from above echos of mercy whispers of love
This is my story this is my song
This is my story this is my song <start> Well I don't know what makes you wanna go
Baby you won't let your feelings show
Now you're leaving me all alone
And I'll be just another broken heart when you're gone
Stay with me just a little bit longer lay with me 'till I'm a little stronger
I can't feel the night alone without love
Baby have a little mercy on me tell me girl you won't leave me lonely
Stay and let's talk awhile about love
All I want is one last night with you
Come the morning do what you wanna do
So it won't be all in vain
Stay this one last night with me and help me ease the pain <start> Words cannot say
What I want them t say
To show how I feel
That my love is real
To hold you my love
Is all I can do
To make you see
You're the world to me
I would climb every mountain
I would sail every sea
There ain't a woman alive who could satisfy
The way you satisfy me
You're the source of my constant joy
And you work so tirelessly
I could never leave and I don't know how
To repay your loyalty <start> I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got
In a hundred million years I'll never stop
'Cause there's nothing in the world
That could keep me from loving you
Well I'm living when I'm loving
And I'm loving every time I'm with you
Just like walking in the sunshine
Lord you make me feel so fine
And as long as we're leaving
And loving the way we want to
I know I'm gonna be
The best loved woman alive
I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got
I couldn't care less if they like it or not
As long as you're satisfied
With the things I do
I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got
In a hundred million years I'll never stop
'Cause there's nothing in the world
That could keep me from loving you
Thrills I feel I know are real
When you touch me
And I wake up every morning
With your arms wrapped around me tight
And the feeling I feel
Is exactly the way it should be
'Cause the love we've got
Keeps growing every day and night
I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got
I couldn't care less if they like it or not
As long as you're satisfied
With the things I do
I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got
In a hundred million years I'll never stop
'Cause there's nothing in the world
That could keep me from loving you
No there's nothing in the world
That could keep me from loving you <start> Writers Skip EwingBill Anderson
A Mamma watched her baby fall and bump his head
Taking baby steps across the floor
She could have tired to catch him but a voice inside her said
In the long run that will only hurt him more
But she picked me up and told me that she loved me
And she held me and she made me feel secure
And I grew to understand what real love means
And what it takes for two hearts to endure
Chorus
Roots and wings
To my ship you are the lighthouse on the shore
And I'm a kite on your string
Your love is my anchor in the storm
And a part of me stays grounded
So the rest of me can fly
Only 'cause you are
My roots and wings
A Daddy kissed his baby and then he fixed her veil
Took her arm and walked down the aisle
When the preacher asked him who gives this child away
He said me and did his best to smile
Now you call him every weekend and you tell him
That you love him and you're thankful as can be
That his firm hand and his soft heart were a blessing
And the reason you can give the gift to me 

Some say love's a circle
Some say love's a light
Some say love's a river
I don't know who's right
But this I know for certain
This I know for truth
The secret to forever
For me and you is...

I'm lucky that you are my roots and wings
 <start> I'm that little voice inside your head
Look at what you've done to me
You knew all along that you were lying when you said
All those pretty words and lovely things
You'd really like to be let off the hook
Won't somebody scrub your conscience clean
But that cannot be done you'll probably need to see a shrink
No you can't take a pill to silence me
So I'll keep talkin' and talkin' I swear I won't give you a moments peace
You'll never again have to look my face but you'll always hear from me
It was so damn easy for you to cut off your affection
So here I am the object of your rejection
Your whole life you've done things just like this
No responsibility no blame
But you can't always get away treatin' people like shit
And expect it won't catch up with you someday
So I'll keep talkin' and talkin' I swear I won't give you a moments peace
You'll never again have to look my face but you'll always hear from me
It was so damn easy for you to cut off your affection
So here I am the object of your rejection
I am your creation
Your the one who trapped me in your brain
Now I'm forced to haunt you
Bet you never thought we'd turn on you this way
So I'll keep talkin' and talkin' I swear I won't give you a moments peace
You'll never again have to look my face but you'll always hear from me
It was so damn easy for you to cut off your affection
So here I am the object of your rejection <start> I can tell you're from the south but it picks out on your mouth
Mississippi gal I love you
And when I hear you call come on and hear you all Mississippi gal I love you
Now a picture of cottage built for two way down south where dreams come true
Vanish in that southern style drives me crazy all the while
Now I walk a million miles for a great big southern smile Mississippi gal I love you
 guitar  fiddle 
Now remember some fine day I've been headin' back your way
Mississippi gal I love you
And when I hear you call come on and hear you all Mississippi gal I love you
Now if you'd make up your mind today I'd give my life and that ain't hay
I'm so tired of roamin' round with a gal like you I'd settle down
I'd walk a million miles for a great big southern smile Mississippi gal I love you <start> It's been here since you've been gone it's been hanging round too long
A thing called sadness not much of a friend when you walked out it walked in
It's in every chair where I sit down it follows me all over town
A thing called sadness not much of a friend when you walked out it walked in
What in the world am I going to do this old friend can't take the place of you
It only brings back memories of you and all the things that we used to do
It's in every chair where I sit down it follows me all over town
A thing called sadness not much of a friend when you walked out sadness walked in <start> 
The old hometown looks the same as I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa
And down the road I look and there runs Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to meet me arms areaching and smiling sweetly
It's so good to touch the green green grass of home
The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
And down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Then I awake and look around me to the four grey walls that surround me
And I realize that I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's that sad old padre arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
And again I'll touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me neath the green green grass of home <start> Oh I know you are out there somewhere
And I dream at night of rolls of chestnut hair
And I would walk to California
If I thought that by some chance you might be there.
Chorus
And I keep thinking I see your face
Then it's gone without a trace
Oh I been every place I thought you'd be.
Why have I just gone drifting on and on
When baby you're the one that's lost at sea.
Oh I have sailed the bright blue waters
And I have overlooked an ocean full of tears.
Just for a glimpse of Heaven's daughter
Before you smile at me and disappear.
Chorus x <start> See the sun how bright it is this morning take a look at all those skies of blue
See the pretty flowers how they're blooming
It will be a grand world when I get over you
See the dewdrops watch them how they glisten
Feel that tender breeze tiptoeing through
Hear the songs the little birds are singing it will be a grand world when I get over you
But my life doesn't dwell oh anything forlorn
I can't see to find my way around now that you're gone
See the little children hear them laughing
And I wonder do you hear those night winds too
Somewhere that moon's a shining down on lovers
It will be a grand world when I get over you
Yes it's such a grand world but I can't get over you <start> Last night you went out again with what you said was your best friend
You say you need some time away from me
The sun was high when you got in but not as high as you had been
And I wonder how you would act if I done just the way I pleased
I've been married just as long as you have
And I get tired of the same old things just the same as you have
Well let me tell you this big boy when you go out for a night of joy
You better start taking me along or you'll be singing a different song
For I've been married just as long as you have
While I'm working hard all day you run around and spend my pay
You entertain your friends at my expence
But you cry and carry on when I do something on my own
And you accuse with lack of evidence
I've been married just as long as you have
And I get tired of the same old things just the same as you have
So let me tell you this sweetheart I figure I've done my part
So don't get cute and get so smart I'll tell you this before you start
I've been married just as long as you have <start> Everybody asks me if I still love you and if you're still on my mind
They ask me to tell about my broken heart and I tell 'em that I'm feelin' fine
So I lie a little bit and I proudly say our book of love is closed
And your memory never bothers me and when it does it comes and goes
It comes and goes all right it comes every morning and it goes all night
I save a lotta pride and I haven't really lied
I tell 'em that it comes and goes
Everybody asks me if I cried when you left me and if I've cried for you since
They ask me to tell so they can all get together and laugh it up at my expense
So I lie a little bit and I proudly say not one teardrop flows
If there is a little pain it's not a constant thing it kinda just comes and goes
It comes and goes all right it comes every morning and it goes all night
I save a lot of pride and I haven't really lied
I tell 'em that it comes and goes. <start> I'LL TAKE YOUR LOVE AT ANYTIME BABY
I have seen this old cold world go gold and silver crazy.
Some people live to fill their pocket and it never seizes to amaze me.
If money can buy them happiness that o'right for them I guess.
Money sure can buy a lot but it can't buy what I've got.
CHORUS
I'll take your love at anytime baby
It's solid as a rock bigger than the sky
I'll take your love at anytime baby
I know it will be there as time goes by
I know I can count on you to keep the juices flowing
This thing between a man and woman beats anything else going
Talk of fortune and talk about fame
It sounds nice is the way to tame <start> Seger was singin' words I could believe in
And Mainstreet was my street that night
So I called up Samantha
And asked her the chance of us runnin' out neath the moon light
Well shes not with me now she can always be found
When I rewind the radio dial
And like it was then I feel her on my skin
And I'm back there for a while
So I labor for hours 'cause I know the power of a song
When a song hits you right
Poured my soul into stories of life
Hopin' someone will hear one tonight
Maybe my voice will cut through the noise
And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys
Comes the sound
The sound of a million dreams
My th summer I was a cocky up and come'er
Crankin' up Born To Run
Turn left out the drive with the pistons open wide
And I came back a prodigal son
My spirit was broken she threw the door open
I love you not I told you so
When I hear mama tried I still break down and cry
And pull to the side of the road
And I labor for hours 'cause I know the power of a song
When a song hits you right
Poured my soul into stories of life
Hopin' someone will hear one tonight
Maybe my voice will cut through the noise
And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys
Comes the sound
The sound of a million dreams
So I labor for hours 'cause I know the power of a song
When a song hits you right
Poured my soul into stories of life
Hopin' someone will hear one tonight
Maybe my voice will cut through the noise
And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys
Comes the sound
The sound of a million dreams
The sound of a million dreams <start> You never cease to amaze me
You can still make me crazy
Baby you can turn me on with just your eyes
You're just so darn appealing
Ooh you stir up sexy feelings
Every man in the room would love to try you on for size
Baby wait 'til I get you home
Wait 'til I get you alone
Wait 'til I get my hands on you
Wait 'til I get you home sweet baby
Wait 'til I get you home
Oh baby you still make me
Feel feelin's that can take me
To places where I've never been before
Well honey I've got a feelin'
We'll make some shadows on the ceilin'
Tonight by candlelight behind closed doors
Baby wait 'til I get you home
Wait 'til I get you alone
Wait 'til I get my hands on you
Wait 'til I get you home sweet baby
Wait 'til I get you home
Your lovin' gets better each time we're together
It's always exciting and new
Each time we discover we're still like young lovers
It's always been magic with you
Baby wait 'til I get you home
You just wait 'til I get you alone
Wait 'til I get my hands on you
Wait 'til I get you home sweet darlin'
Wait 'til I get you home
Wait 'til I get you alone
Wait 'til I get my hands on you
Wait 'til I get you home sweet baby
Wait 'til I get you home sweet darlin'
Wait 'til I get you home
You just wait you just wait
I can't wait I can't wait <start> It took me by surprise
When I saw you standing there
Close enough to touch
Breathing the same air
You asked me how I've been
I guess that's when I smiled and said just fine
Oh but baby I was lying
What I really meant to say
Is I'm dying here inside
And I miss you more each day
There's not a night I haven't cried
And baby here's the truth
I'm still in love with you
That's what I really meant to say
And as you walked away
The echo of my words
Cut just like a knife
Cut so deep it hurt
I held back the tears
Held onto my pride
And watched you go
I wonder if you'll ever know
What I really meant to say
Is I'm dying here inside
And I miss more each day
There's not a night I haven't cried
And baby here's the truth
I'm still in love with you
What I really meant to say
Is I'm really not that strong
No matter how I try
I'm still holdin' on
And here's the honest truth
I'm still in love with you
Yeah that's what I really meant to say
That's what I really meant to say
That's what I really meant to say. <start> Things were much better back then when I was abroad
I had no trouble find in her friend when I was her bro
I'd wonder for miles and miles
And every face gave me a smile
From a grand cooly damn to the Nile when I was abroad
Mhmm
Well I never had trouble with love when I was abroad
Though it seem to fall from above when I was abroad
And no matter when we were engaged
And soon enough everything changed
I was held back and kept in caged from being abroad
When I was abroad I saw
Everything there was to see
Since I've been home with you
Well I just don't feel like me
My days just seem to hang low
When every day used to be stand
So I'm telling my wife that I miss my old life
And I'm working on change it back <start> I love you so much that I can't leave you
And even though my mind tells me I should
But then you make me think that you still love me
Then all my thoughts of leaving do no good
You've got me heart over mind worried all the time
Knowing you will always be the same
You keep hurting me I know but I still can't let you go
Cause my heart won't let my love for you change
 guitar  steel 
Friends tell me they see you out with others
And in my heart I try hard to forget
But then you come home and say you love me
And I still hope there's some chance for us yet
You've got me heart over mind...
Cause my heart won't let my love for you change <start> It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all
All day long I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd
Old Mr. Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all <start> Sunday morning I go to church then again on Sunday night
Monday morning I go to work home and family Monday night
Tuesday Wednesday it's the same working for my daily bread
Thursday Friday then I get my pay Friday night I'm late to bed
Oh but Saturday is my day to rest get up late no need to shave
Count the many ways that I've been blessed
Enjoying all the things the good Lord gave
Sunday morning I'm back at church again on Sunday night
I say a prayer for peace on earth that's the way I live my life
 dobro 
Oh but Saturday is my day...
Doing what I think is right that's the way I live my life <start> The day you walked away you left the hurt behind
A hurt that kept on growing all the time
A hurt that lit the match that burned my world down
Till everything was gone gone gone
And now I'm left among the ashes of my dreams
Searching for a reason to go on
But all that's left is hurt and hurt is not enough
When everything is gone gone gone
Now in my quiet garden I found peace at last I've
Left the hurt behind me in the past
I walk among the flowers that bloom here in the sun
And all the hurt is gone gone gone
But then at night they come and take me to my room
And like a little child I go along
And if my room has force it's not that I've done wrong
Yes just my mind is gone gone gone <start> Your world was so different from mine don't you see
And we couldn't be close though we tried
We both reached for heavens but ours weren't the same
That's what happens when two worlds collide
Your world was made up of things sweet and good
My world could never fit in I wish it could
Two hearts lie in shambles and oh they've cried
That's what happens when two worlds collide <start> I was sittin' with him on his front porch swing
Soaking up wisdom and Grandma's sweet tea
Listening to his stories man he'd done it all
His tour in the Army and his wilder days
Raising my daddy and bailing his hay
He cut off a twist of tobacco stuck it in his jaw
Cocked back his hat with a sideways grin and
Gave me that ole wink
He said I can tell you something 'bout most anything
Chorus
But don't ask me about a woman
All I know is boy they're something
They're tender and they're tough
Can break it down and lift you up
Don't ask me about a woman
That's some complicated stuff
They ain't made to figure out
They're just made to love
He said boy I've lived nearly eighty years
There's a lot of know how between these ears
But when it comes to your grandma
I'm still your age
It took me a long long time to learn
Loving a woman is full of left turns
The more they change the more they stay the same
Son it's been that way since the beginning of time
We're behind the wheel but just along for the ride
Chorus
Fast forward ten years it's Saturday night
She's changed three times says her hair ain't right
My mind reels back to the time and place
When I heard my grandpa say
Don't ask me about a woman
Boy that's some complicated stuff
They ain't made to figure out
They're just made to love
Now I know what he's talkin' about
They're just made to love <start> I'll be your companion
Stay right here by your side
And I will never let go
Until the day you die
Here 'til the end
The best love you'll find
If you'll just hold me
Some say I'm trouble
From the first touch of your hand
But I can bring you comfort
And I'll always understand
I'll quench your thirst
In the desert sand
If you'll just hold me
Oh I am just a bottle
And I'm only made of glass
But I am full of courage
To help you forget the past
I'll be strong when you're weak
If you'll give me a try
Oh with your help I can rule your life
If you'll just hold me
Temptation is my Kingdom
And I rule it day and night
Oh I can take two wrongs you've done
And make them seem alright
I'll conceal the truth
'Til you believe a lie
If you'll just hold me
Oh I am just a bottle
And I'm only made of glass
But I am full of courage
To help you forget the past
I'll be strong when you're weak
If you'll give me a try
Oh with your help I can rule your life
If you'll just hold me
I'll be strong when you're weak
If you'll give me a try
Oh I can be the last love of your life
If you'll just hold me
If you'll just hold me
Won't you hold me
Oh please hold me <start> I remember the day when the snow melted away and the great snowman was wed
He said yes I do and little Linda said it too and the great snowman was wed
Well Jimmy Jones was the snowman's name he put all the other local lovers to shame
He had good looks and a real fine car went around breaking all the pretty girls' hearts
Until one day the great snowman found Linda Lou started melting him down
He bought the ring and they named the day
And the great snowman started melting away
I remember the day...
Now the great snowman and his loving spouse live in a little subdivision house
They've got six kids and a mother in law another kiddie comin' in the fall
His old Cadillac needs the paint retouched it's full of baby diapers and bottles and such
The great snowman he has outgrown all his fancy cuddy clothes
I remember the day...
And the great snowman was wed <start> YOUR MEM'RY COMES ALONG

' Ridge Music

Tears start falling I can hardly see my heart's breaking for oh lonesome me
I tell myself I'll be alright and nothing's really wrong
Oh but just then about that time your mem'ry comes along
Each day I tell myself the hurtin's hurtin' less and less
And that I should be happy that you're gone
But time and time again I feel so lonely and I guess
Oh that's the time your mem'ry comes along
And now my tears start falling I can hardly see...
Each day I tell myself to go and find somebody new
To replace the love I loved so long
Oh but when I'm holding someone else instead of holding you
Oh that's the time your mem'ry comes along
Tears start falling I can hardly see...
But just then about that time your mem'ry comes along <start> When you say love you're telling everyone your moment's come
And you've found out what you've been looking for
When you say love you've said the only word that tells the world
You never will be lonely anymore
You've got a pretty rainbow of your own
And at last you've found your pot of gold
You're completely satisfied a feeling of contentment fills your soul
When you say love it means you've found your special one
And that you care enough to give your very best
When you say love there's not another word that says so much
But that fourletter word means happiness
Your heart has given wings to touch the sky
Much higher than the eagle dares to fly
If you took everything you've heard and tried to make a magic word
You'll find you've said it all when you say love
When you say love it means you've found your special one...
When you say love <start> Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside there was somethin' going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got somethin' goin' on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel
Needs no conversation
We ride it together ahah
Makin' love with each other ahah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one inbetween
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other ahah
From one lover to another ahah
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothin' if you got no one
And you did walk in tonight
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever
We can ride it together ahah
Makin' love with each other ahah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one inbetween
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other ahah
From one lover to another ahah
Sail away
Oh come sail away with me
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one inbetween
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other ahah
From one lover to another ahah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one inbetween
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other ahah
From one lover to another ahah <start> I don't know why I love you but I do
I don't know why I cry so but its true
I only know I'm lonely and that I'll want you only
I don't know why I love you but I do
I can't sleep nights because I feel so restless
I don't know what to do I feel so helpless
And Since you've been away I've cryed both night and day
I don't know why I love you but I do
My days have been so lonely Night time been so blue
I don't know why I cry so but I do
Each night I sit alone and tell myself
That I will fall in love with someone else
I know I'm Wasting time but I got to free my time
I don't know why I love you but I do
Music
My days have been so lonely my nights have been so blue
I don't know why I cry so but I do
Each night I sit alone and tell myself
That I will fall in love with someone else
I know I'm wasting time but I've got to clear my mind
I don't know why I love you but I do
I don't know why I love you but I do
I don't know why I love you but I do <start> Only you can make my dreams come true only you can turn my skies to blue
Love like ours should not be far apart only you can break my heart
Only you can end these sleepless nights only you can make things turn out right
You and you alone can keep us far apart only you can break my heart
Only you can break my heart <start> I came from a town that was so small you look both ways and you could see it all
All I wanted was some way out every evening I'd slip into town
And stand around by the caution light and watch the big trucks rolling by
For me it was a beautiful sight big wheels in the moonlight
I had a case of wanderlust I'd lie awake with the windows up
Out on highway fiftynine I could hear some big old diesel whine
She was going through all the gears headed out to who knows where
I fell asleep most every night dreaming about big wheels in the moonlight
And I want to put my life on the centerline
And I want to see the world before I die
And I know that there's a peace I'll never find
'Cause those big old wheels keep rolling through my mind
How I got here it's hard to say so many things got in my way
Can't complain about all I've got kids and a wife and a regular job
But at night when I'm setting here all alone in a living room chair
Sometimes I close my eyes and see big wheels in the moonlight
And I want to put my life on the centerline
And I want to see the world before I die
And I know that there's a peace I'll never find
'Cause those big old wheels keep rolling through my mind
And I want to put my life on the centerline
And I want to see the world before I die
And I know that there's a peace I'll never find
'Cause those big old wheels keep rolling through my mind
'Cause those big old wheels keep rolling through my mind <start> This ain't no candlelight
Warm glass of wine night
It's more a whiskey water
Drink that's on the rocks kind
Let's crank the radio
Get this truck on into town
Somebody call the fire department
We're gonna burn it down
Girl I can see it in your eyes
I know you're feeling like getting wild
Whatever gets you moving
Gets you grooving
Gets you fired up
We're gonna get it
If you really want it bad enough
Yeah we're gonna chase it
Get all crazy
Gonna lose our minds
Whatever's gonna get you feeling right
Girl we're gonna find it tonight
You call your girlfriends up
And I'll call some boys of mine
I know the bouncer at the bar
No we don't stand in line
I'll hit the DJ with some money
He'll play all your songs
We're gonna get it right
Even if it's all wrong
Girl I can see you're eyes
I know you're feeling like getting wild
Whatever gets you moving
Gets you grooving
Gets you fired up
We're gonna get it
If you really want it bad enough
Yeah we're gonna chase it
Get all crazy
Gonna lose our minds
Whatever's gonna get you feeling right
Girl we're gonna find it tonight
Girl I can see it in your eyes
Gonna have fun when we get home tonight
Whatever gets you moving
Gets you grooving
Gets you fired up
We're gonna get it
If you really want it bad enough
Yeah we're gonna chase it
Get all crazy
Gonna lose our minds
Whatever's gonna get you feeling right
Girl we're gonna find it tonight
We're gonna find it tonight
Yeah we're gonna find it tonight
Whatever's gonna get you feeling right
Girl we're gonna find it tonight <start> I bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you let it be me
Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love what would life be
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love what would life be
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll alwaysletit beme <start> Ive been sitting down here so long I composed a song
I wanna meet you Country gal
Every time she dance I wish I had the chance
Theres a river flowing in every man
All the trees do sway when she dance that way
I wanna meet you country gal
I swear she must have been born from that blossoms breeze
She got diamonds all around her ankle bone
She got her gals gathered round and the boys cant make no time
Shes like a ruby rolling round in a bucket of dimes
She got skin like chocolate milkmake a married man feel no guilt
The way she moves when she moves and she groove
Somebody slap my face and throw me under the jail
Cause I cant stop thinking about that country gal <start> I guess you noticed there's only eleven roses
I chosen from our garden where they grew
Take the roses and look into the mirror
And the twelfth rose will be looking back at you
There's just something about us bringing roses
To a woman they say a more than a man can say
After what I've done you may not keep the roses
But I just thought I would send them anyways
There's just something about us bringing roses
To a woman they say more than a man can say
After what I've done you may not keep the roses
But I just though I would send them anyways
After what I've done you may not keep the roses
But I just thought I would send them anyways <start> The hills were alive with wildflowers and I was as wild even wilder than they
For at least I could run they just died in the sun and I refused to just wither in place
Just a wild mountain rose needing freedom to grow
So I ran fearing up where I'd go
When a flower grows wild it can always survive wildflowers don't care where they grow
And the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close I had no room for growth
And I wanted so much to branch out
So I uprooted myself from home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road
When a flower grows wild it can always survive wildflowers don't care where they grow
 ac.guitar 
I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right in a garden so different from me
I just never belonged I just longed to be gone so the garden one day set me free
I hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
I just let him decide where we'd go
When a flower grows wild it can always survive wildflowers don't care where they grow
Just a wild mountain rose seeking mist'ries untold no regret for the path that chose
When a flower grows wild it can always survive wildflowers don't care where they grow
Mhm hm hm mhm...
Wildflowers don't care where they grow <start> Come and look out through the window
That big old moon is shinin' down
Tell me now don't it remind you
Of a blanket on the ground
Remember back when love first found us
We'd go slippin' out of town
And we'd love beneath the moonlight
On a blanket on the ground
I'll get the blanket from the bedroom
And we'll go walkin' once again
To that spot down by the river
Where our sweet love first began
Just because we are married
Don't mean we can't slip around
So let's walk out through the moonlight
And lay the blanket on the ground
Oh remember how excited
We used to get when love was young
That old moon was our best buddy
We couldn't wait for night to come
Now you know you still excite me
I know you love me like I am
Just once more I wish you'd love me
On the blanket on the ground
I'll get the blanket from the bedroom
And we'll go walkin' once again
To that spot down by the river
Where our sweet love first began
Just because we are married
Don't mean we can't slip around
So let's walk out through the moonlight
And lay the blanket on the ground
Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Do do do do do do <start> FINAL EXAMINATION
WITH DON GIBSON

You reset with the love that has built to stand on its own
Somewhere we surely went wrong
So let's study our hearts we may learn we might change our minds
A final examination to test our situation may find love is not really gone
We've been countin' our sorrows and forgettin' all the good times we had
And somewhere love left us alone
So let's count on each other and together we might make the grade
A final examination to test our situation may find love is not really gone
We've been countin' our sorrows... <start> No sign of living no sign of the dead there's someone existing in this house instead
No flowers are blooming no children to cry no fire is burning no tears fill the eyes
There's someone existing from twilight till dawn
There's someone who's missing someone all day long
Well which someone who's giving up all hope and faith
There's no sign of living in my house today
There's no sign of living in my house today <start> I've got some big news
The bank finally came through
And I'm holdin' the keys to a brand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside it sure is a nice night
How about a little test drive
Down by the lake
There's a place I know about where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the fourwheel drive
Come on now what do you say
Girl I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires.
'Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shore line
I've got the perfect place in mind.
It's in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires.
Moonlight on a duck blind
Catfish on a trot line
Sun sets about nine this time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singin' in the background
And more stars that you can count on a night this clear.
I tell you what we need to do
Is grab a sleepin' bag or two
And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires.
'Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shore line
I've got the perfect place in mind.
It's in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires.
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires <start> We got a bucket of Corona
Enough stories to last all night
About the trials and tribulations
Of findin' Mr. Right
Of findin' a good man.
Here's to the liars and the cheaters and the cold mistreaters
To the Momma's boys who can't make a stand.
Here's to the superficial players
The I love ya toosoonsayers
If you hear me girls raise your hand
Let's have a toast
Here's to findin' a good man.
Blind dates an' horror stories
Pushy gals and fast movers.
Let's dedicate this girl's night out
To bigtalkers bad losers
It's so hard findin' a good man.
Here's to the liars and the cheaters and the cold mistreaters
To the Momma's boys who can't make a stand.
Here's to the superficial players
The I love ya toosoonsayers
If you hear me girls raise your hand
Let's have a toast
Here's to findin' a good man.
Julie I know you want perfection
Angie you want a listener.
Lisa your list is gettin' long
And girls you know meI just want a good kisser.
Here's to the liars and the cheaters and the cold mistreaters
To the Momma's boys who can't make a stand.
Here's to the superficial players
The I love ya toosoonsayers
If you hear me girls raise your hand
Let's have a toast
Let's have a toast
Here's to findin' a good man.
Here's to findin' a good man.
Here's to findin' a good man. <start> STRANGER'S STORY

' copyright control
Oh come hear a story a stranger just told me
Of a woman who meant everything
So proud he once owned her but he has her no longer
For she wears another man's ring
He talked of the good time they'd had in the springtime
Before she was stolen away
He blamed her oh no none he said she was too young
And that's why she wanted to stray
We drank to her new love that it might be true love
Her future both happy and bright
With his eyes growing misty he drank down the whiskey
That was telling his story that night
And though he didn't even know me he told me all of his story
And not one single word did he say without pride
And then he asked me if I blamed her but oh when he named her
I wanted to run out and hide
How could I tell him the man that had dealt him
His sadness and sorrow was me
I ran from the table while I was still able
To hold back my own misery
And now a wonder comes to me that maybe he knew me
And he told me just so I'd cry
But without his knowing my teardrops were flowing
For she had just told me goodbye <start> In my high school we separate the rich from the rest
Those who wear rags and those who only wear the best
And in my high school the hold assemblies for the football team
But never for the kids with different dreams

We've got jocks and we've got smokers
Rednecks and jokers
There's a category for us all
And we stuggle with out homework our teachers and their rules
Yeah they think we're just adolescent fools
In my high school there's some who think they're tough as they can be
But when I look in their eyes all I see is insecurity
And in my high school there's some who will wait
And then there's some who won't
Some that cross those lines and some that don't

We've got outcasts and we've got rebels
Mostly saints sometimes devils
You see them walkin' up and down the hall
As they stuggle with their boyriends their girlfriends their math
And they long for the bell that gets them out of class...in my high school

We laugh we cry we fall we fly.
And sometimes we wonder why we're even here
We pass we fail and only time will tell
If we'll ever make it though these teenage years
In my high school there's some who study for their entrance exams
Some just want to play guitar in some rock 'n roll band
And in my high school the seniors just can't wait for June
They don't realize that we grow up way too soon <start> I had a broken watch on a broken chain
I had a rood that leaked every time it rained
I had an old guitar that wouldn't stay in tune
But now it sounds just fine since I've met you
I'm good as new
I had some crazy thoughts runnin' through my brain
Wonderin' if my life was goin' down the drain
I had a broken heart broken right in two
But now it's in one piece since I've met you
I'm good as new
You made my life like a lullaby
You put the spark back into my eyes
You put the shine in the shining sea
And you hung the moon where it should be
Now my old yard is looking nice and green
And my old car well it's a clean machine
Even my old dog she can feel it too
It's not the same old thing since I've met you
I'm good as new <start> I can smell the onions floating in the air
Must be something that you ate
I can't imagine how your mouth must taste
Forgive me if I turn away
The slightest whiff just brings me to my knees
Almost pass out in your arms
I need a gas mask every time that you come near
And the halitosis starts
I can smell your breath
It's choking me to death
The only who doesn't know is you
Here's some gum to chew
Er baby there's no way you're kissing me
What you have for lunch
Don't you ever brush
Maybe a Binaca Blast or two is what I'd suggest
I can smell your breath
Bad breath
It's tough to be there when you're waking up
And that green cloud fills up the room
It's worser than it's ever been before
And I know and you know
And everybody in a three mile radius knows
You should a dentist soon
'Cause I can smell your breath
It's gagging me to death
Something must have died inside of you
What you ought to do
Is chase a Cert or two
With Listerine
Even when you're gone
The odor lingers on
I'm buying you an Oral be and a jumbo tube of Crest
'Cause I can smell your breath
Bad breath
Can't you smell the fog that's floating through the air
Must be something that you ate <start> Love puts the blush in your smile
And love is always in style
Love puts the stars in your eyes
Love is so hard to disguise
Love cures hate and bitterness
And love gives you courage from distress
Like a wave that keeps looking for the shore
Love is the look you're looking for
Love can beautify and love can satisfy
Love should always be your guide
Love is happiness and love is faithfulness
True love needs no place to hide
Love of joy will make you cry
And love will never ever die
Love won't deny rich or poor
Love is the look you're looking for
Yes love is the look you're looking for
True love is the look you're looking for <start> Well in eighteenfourteen we took a little trip
Along with colonel jackson down the mighty mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody british at the town of new orleans.
Chorus
We fired our guns and the british kept acomin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they all began arunnin'
Down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico
Well we eyeballed the river and we see the limeys come
Musta been a hunnert of 'em beatin' on a drum
And then they stepped so high and they made the bugles ring
We hid behind our cotton bales and didn't say a thing
Chorus
We fired our guns and the british kept acomin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they all began arunnin'
Down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico
Now old hickory says we can take 'em by surprise
If we don't shoot our wads 'til we look 'em in the eyes
So we held off our fire 'til we see them real well
Then we opened up our squirrel guns and really gave 'em hell
Chorus
We fired our guns and the british kept acomin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they all began arunnin'
Down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico
Well they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where the rabbits couldn't go
Ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
Down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico.
Well we fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we turned his tail around
We stuffed his head with cannon balls and powdered his behind
And when we lit the fuse that old gator blew his mind
Chorus
We fired our guns and the british kept acomin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they all began arunnin'
Down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico
Well they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where the rabbits couldn't go
Ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
Down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico.
Hup hip trip four.
You know you old boys gonna be marchin' right smart onced you learn to count to four. <start> May you always walk in sunshine slumber warm when night winds blow
May you always live with laughter for a smile becomes you so
May good fortune find your doorway may the bluebirds sing your song
May no trouble travel your way may no worry stay too long
May your heartaches be forgotten may all tears be spilled
May old acquaintance be remembered when your cup of time is filled
And may you always be a dreamer may your wildest dream come true
May you find someone to love as much as I love you
 <start> Come in as you tread life's journey
Take Jesus as your daily guide
Though you may feel pure and safely
Without Him walking by your side
But when you come to make the crossing
At the ending of your pilgrim's way
If you ever will meet our Savior
You'll surely meet Him on that day
Now look at that cold Jordan
Look at these deep waters
Look at that wide river
Oh hear the mighty billows roar
You'd better take Jesus with you
He's a true companion
For I'm sure without Him
That you never will make it o'er
That awful Day of Judgment
Is coming in the by and by
We'll see our Lord descending
In Glory from on high
So let us keep in touch with Jesus
And in his grace the Love of God
That we may be ever called ready
When He calls us over Jordan's Tide
Now look at that cold Jordan
Look at these deep waters
Look at that wide river
Oh hear the mighty billows roar
You'd better take Jesus with you
He's a true companion
For I'm sure without Him
That you never will make it o'er <start> If I could see you just one time
Oh how it'd ease my troubled mind
If I could hold you just one time
And then pretend that you're still mine
Lips that used to thrill me so
They now thrill someone else I know
Gone is the love that once was mine
Wish I could see you just one time
Oh oh oh oh I miss you so
Oh I need you so
I'd I'd I'd give this heart of mine
If I could see you just one time
Wish I could relive just one time
Turn back the pages and there I'd find
That same old love that once was mine
Wish I could see you just one time <start> I'm always out there chasing rainbows always going for the gold
Searching for you in far off places yes I'm always out there chasing rainbows
Your memory makes me think of rainbows of summer days and daffodils
Of tender times and sweet surrender I loved you then and always will
I'm always out there...
Rainbow are things of mystic beauty that appear like magic in the sky
To tell the world the storm is over ah but sometimes rainbows make me cry
I'm always out there...
Yes I'm always out there chasing rainbows <start> For a long long time now just about every night
You found some excuse not to hold me tight
No matter what I do you sit and pout don't let that doorknob hit you going out
Don't let that doorknob hit you going out honey
Others lips now thrill you there's no doubt
There's no burden like the love you make me live without
Don't let that doorknob hit you going out
 el.banjo  fiddle 
I've laid awake nights to two or three so near to you but you're so far from me
The battle's done you won the fight no doubt
Don't let that doorknob hit you going out
Don't let that doorknob hit you...
Don't let that doorknob hit you going out <start> He rode up on a winter day
Steam risin' off a streak face bay
Said you probably know my name
If you don't it's Arkansas Dave
He talked of fifteen years ago
And how he got the bay he rode
He said he killed a man in Ohio
First man he killed first horse he stole
It was a long road for Arkansas Dave
He shot and left him where he laid
He said he'd never forget that winter day
He rode off on a streak faced bay
I stood up and I shook his hand
Told no one that I knew this man
Started thinkin' of a plan
Bout how I'd deal him his last hand
Didn't take him long to come unwound
He jumped up and gunned two men down
Ran outside to leave the town
But ole bay was nowhere to be found
I head out with my fortyfour
And when he walked back through the door
I shot till I could shoot no more
And Dave Rudabough fell to the floor
It was the end of the road for Arkansas Dave
I shot and left him where he laid
I'll never forget that winter day
I rode off on a streak faced bay
No I'll never forget that winter day
When I rode home on Daddy's streak face bay <start> 
It's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you
All I can do to keep from letting it show
Yeah it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you
All I can do to keep from telling you so
I wasn't looking for love when I found you
Just someone to be with and have a good time
But I get these strange funny feelings around you
When you're not with me you're still on my mind
And it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you
All I can do to keep from letting it show
Yeah it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you
All I can do to keep from telling you so
I had intended to wait for a long time
I thought that love would just mess up my plans
'Cause I had big plans for a bright shining future
Could this be my future that's holding my hand
And it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you
All I can do to keep from letting it show
Yeah it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you
All I can do to keep from telling you so
I need to tell you how I feel about you
But I'm so afraid that you don't feel the same
But if I don't tell you how I feel about you
I just might lose you can I take that chance
And it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you
All I can do to keep from letting it show
Yeah it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you
All I can do to keep from telling you so <start> I watch you grow away from me in photographs
And memories like spies
And salt betrays my eyes again
I started losing sleep and gaining weight
And wishing I was was ten again
So I could be your friend again
These days we go to waste like wine
That's turned to turpentine
It's six AM and I'm all messed up
I didn't mean to waste your time
So I'll fall back in line
But I'm warning you we're growing up
I heard you found some pretty words to say
You found your little game to play
And there's no one allowed in
Then just when we believe we could be great
Reality it permeates
And conquers from within again
These days we go to waste like wine
That's turned to turpentine
It's six a.m and I'm all messed up
I didn't mean to waste your time
So I'll fall back in line
But I'm warning you we're growing up <start> O holy night The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees Oh hear the angel voices
O night divine the night when Christ was born
O night O holy night O night divine
O night O holy night O night divine
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need our weakness is no stranger
Behold your King Before him lowly bend
Behold your King Before him lowly bend
Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord Then ever ever praise we
His power and glory ever more proclaim
His power and glory ever more proclaim <start> Go ahead baby overreact.
Tell me how you feel don't hold back.
It's been way too long since we had a good fight. We both know how we get.
When tempers get heated you know what comes next.
So come on baby let's have it out right now.
Slam the door if you want to.
Throw the telephone across the room.
Kick everything up against the wall.
Let's make ourselves some room.
Yeah let's fight it out baby.
'Cause I love making up with you.
I love the way you look when you're tryin' to be tough.
So let's think of a reason to get us both riled up.
Let's cross that line tonight boy anything goes.
Slam the door if you want to.
Throw the telephone across the room.
Kick everything up against the wall.
Let's make ourselves some room.
Yeah let's fight it out baby.
'Cause I love making up with you.
Light the candles and poor the champagne.
First let's get everything out of the way.
Slam the door if you want to.
Throw the telephone across the room.
Kick everything up against the wall.
Let's make ourselves some room.
Yeah let's fight it out baby.
'Cause I love making up with you.
Yeah turn out the lights baby.
You know I love makin' up with you <start> CC Waterback one tequila sunrise
One's for my aching head the other's for my bloodshot eyes
Last night I let it all hang out I guess that's how my head got sore
CC Waterback I can't stand the pain no more
Last night we got invited to a party at the Jones' place
For fun and games and booze and things I guess I must drunk a case
But that lady of mine drank warm red wine til she couldn't even find the door
She wound up on the Jones' bed and I wound up on the floor
CC Waterback one tequila sunrise
CC Waterback one tequila sunrise <start> Nights like this I wonder if I'm dreamin'
You dance as if your feet are off the ground
Almost like the world has stopped to watch us
Waiting for that moment you touch down
CHORUS
So nights like this I stand a little taller
To prove that I am worthy of your kiss
I live for the spell you put me under
And the way I feel on nights like this
I know tomorrow I'll be leavin'
With the memory of tonight still in my mind
And it's a long and lonesome highway
That takes me from this love I leave behind
CHORUS
Girl I never take for granted
The tender dying moments of our time
Memories are all that get me through
Until we never have to say goodbye
CHORUS
And the way I feel on nights like this <start> God is great
Man is not
Man made whiskey
God made pot
God made women
We make war
But oh a good woman
That's worth fighting for
Oh yea
And the way Im feelin'
Ain't never gonna change
Baby dont you know my heart is healing
Every time I see your face
Chorus
La da da da da da dee
Oh God made you and God made me
He made you a girl to pull me through
And he made this man for loving you
Hallelujah so glad I bumped into ya
Hallelujah so glad I bumped into ya
God made grandma
She made pie
Taste so good
Bring a tear to your eye
Make a grown man cry
God made music
God made love
And he made Smokey Robinson
So let's put him on and make some that's right
Yeah
Hallelujah
Chorus
La da da da da da dee
Oh God made you and God made me
He made you a girl to pull me through
And he made this man for loving you
Hallelujah so glad I bumped into ya
Hallelujah so glad I bumped into ya
I don't want no tie
I want no suit
Just want you in your birthday suit
Don't want no cars
Want no trucks
Just want you
And I want your love oh yeah baby
Just want you
And I want your love
Oh la da da da da da dee
Oh God made you and God made me
He made you a girl to pull me through
And he made this man
Oh la da da da da da dee
Oh God made you and god made me
He made you a girl to pull me through
And he made this man
Yeah he made this man
And he made this man for loving you
Hallelujah
So glad bumped into ya <start> His eyes are greener than the meadows
His hair is greyer than a ghost
His lungs are blacker than the shadows
That dance in circles down below
You see them every Monday morning
Electric halos light their way
Five days of widows mourning
But Friday rolls the stone away
Chorus
Kentucky mine doing time
Never see the light of day
Kentucky mine stand in line
Just to dig your own grave
From coal dust they make a living
To coal dust they will return
The earth is good but unforgiving
And someone's got to keep the fire burnin'
Daddy says Listen to me
Do not follow where my footsteps lead
Chorus
And everything he said was true
But what's a Kentucky boy like me to do
Chorus <start> When you close your eyes and you fall asleep
And it's down to the sound of a heartbeat
I can hear the things you're dreamin' about
When you open up your heart and the truth comes out
You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right
'Cause I hear it in the night
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
When I hold you in my arms at night
Don't you know that you sleep in the spotlight
And all your dreams you keep inside
You're telling me the secrets that you just can't hide
You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right
'Cause I hear it in the night
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
When you're talking in your sleep
When you're talking in your sleep <start> If you fall out of love with me don't let me know
If someone else is on your mind don't let it show
For I'd rather have your lie I could never stand goodbye
If you fall out of love with me don't let me know
If you find somebody new don't let me know
If your love for me is through don't let it show
If I ask you please don't say darlin' turn and walk away
If you fall out of love with me don't let me know
If your love for me is gone don't let me know
If someone else is in your dreams don't let it show
Close your eyes so I won't see for I don't want sympathy
If you fall out of love with me don't let me know <start> If love was a river
And I was a drowning man
Would you get in the water
Would you lend me a hand
If love was a river
Would you sit on the land
If love was a mountain
High above this town
Would you climb to the top
Would you never look down
If love was a mountain
Would you go around
Love may only knock so many times upon your door
And heaven only knows if it will come back anymore
If love was a firefly
Sitting in your hand
Would you laugh when it twinkled
Let it go again
If love was a firefly
Would you understand
If love was a party
With everyone you know
Would you dance if I asked you
Would you smile and say no
If love was a party
Would you even go
Love may only knock so many times upon your door
And heaven only knows if it will come back anymore
If love was a fast train on a oneway track
Would you turn in your ticket
Would you never look back
If love was a fast train
Would you even pack <start> 
In this mental institution lookin' out through these iron bars
How could he put me in here how could he go that far
Yes I need help but not this kind he didn't love me from the start
But it's not my mind that's broken it's my heart
Oh Daddy come and get me and take me home with you
I'm depending on you Daddy there's nothing I can do
And you said that I could come to you if I ever was in need
But Daddy I can't come to you you'll have to come to me
When he said he loved another I was crazy with jealousy
That's 'cause I was crazy over him and I couldn't stand to set him free
And I couldn't stand to lose him and I cried and cried for days
And he said that I was crazy but he just put me in here to get me out of his way
Daddy come and get me
Oh Daddy come and get me and take me home with you
I'm depending on you Daddy 'cause there's nothing else I can do
And you said that I could come to you if I ever was in need
But Daddy I can't come to you you'll have to come to me <start> We were proud of this house that we found on a street
In the nice part of town
Had it furnished with care we were once happy here
Now it's a beautiful unhappy home
Planted red sweet hard roses for you
Painted our rooms your favorite blue
Now the colors remain but our love's not the same
Oh it's a beautiful unhappy home
What a beautiful unhappy home
It's so hard to believe it's our own
But we're both held here by a child we love dear
In this beautiful unhappy home
Yes we're both held here
In our beautiful unhappy home <start> We came here to get away
Hopin paradise could save our love
Breathe some life back into us
But it's  degrees and still
I can't seem to shake this chill inside
There's a distance in your eyes
I tried
To wake old feeling 'neath the moon and stars
If I could
I would send a post card to your heart
Wish you were here
We're lying face to face
Wish you were here
You'd really love this place
Wish you were here
We've come all this way and left you behind
Heart without you love is blind
Wish you were here
For love's sake you try to smile
But your heart's a million miles away
Oh mine's about to break
But I won't give up cause I believe
Love is still alive in me and you
Together we can pull it through
Let go
We can leave our doubts here in the dark
Hold on
We will send this message to your heart
Wish you were here
We're lying face to face
Wish you were here
You'd really love this place
Wish you were here
We've come all this way and left you behind
Heart without you love is blind
Wish you were here <start> Hello Mrs Johnson you self righteous woman
Sunday School teacher what brings you out slummin'
Do you reckon the preacher would approve where you are
Standing here vis'tin' with a back slidin' christian in a neighborhood bar
Well yes that's my bottle and yes that's my glass
And I see you're eye balling this pretty young lass
It ain't none of your business but yes she's with me
And we don't need no sermon you self righteous woman just let us be
The Lord knows I'm drinking and running around
And he don't need your loud mouth informing the town
The Lord knows I'm sinning and sinning ain't right
But me and the good Lord gonna have us a good talk later tonight
Goodbye Mrs Johnson you self righteous biddy
I don't need your preaching and I don't need your pity
So go back to whatever you hypocrites do
And when I talk to heaven be nice and I'll put in a good word for you
Yes the Lord knows I'm drinking...
Yes me and the good Lord gonna have us a good talk later tonight <start> Hey maybe I'll dye my hair
Maybe I'll move somewhere
Maybe I'll get a car
Maybe I'll drive so far
That I'll lose track
Me I'll bounce right back
Maybe I'll sleep real late
Maybe I'll lose some weight
Maybe I'll clear my junk
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine
Me I'll be just
Fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow get me way down
Hey maybe I'll learn to sew
Maybe I'll just lie low
Maybe I'll hit the bars
Maybe I'll count the stars until dawn
Me I will go on
Maybe I'll settle down
Maybe I'll just leave town
Maybe I'll have some fun
Maybe I'll meet someone
And make him mine
Me I'll be just
Fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
'Cause I'll be fine

Oh I'll be fine <start> Where his wheels left the road broken glass and twisted steel
Were the only traces left of that worn out Oldsmobile
Oh the mist hung on that mountain like a winter overcoat
And the Deputies found him where his wheels left the road
He had left the Diamond Horeshoe drank that whiskey river dry
That's the tale the Sheriff told to his sister and his wife
They could claim their Dear Beloved at the White Oak Funeral Home
And the Deputy could show them where the wheels left the road
Now they're bring food and flowers to the kitchen of his home
They placed a little cross where his wheels left the road
But the truth will soon be buried there's a secret no one knows
He was not out on that highway when his wheels left the road
It was back in that old bar room in the smoke and neon lights
He was dancing with a woman just before he crossed the line
In a room next to the Horseshoe wedding ring down in his coat
He took her in his arms and his wheels left the road
Where his wheels left the road broken glass and twisted steel
Were the only traces left of his worn out Oldsmobile
Oh the mist hangs on that mountain like a winter overcoat
And the Deputies found him where his wheels left the road <start> The bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely girls like me
A cabarete a honky tonk their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights
Lights that say forget his name in a glass of cherry wine
Lights that offer other guys for empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights
Lights that say forget his love in a different atmosphere
Lights that lure are nothing but a masquerade for tears
They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
And I just can't say I love you to a street of city lights <start> Maybe I don't love you quite as much
As I believe I love you baby
But don't tell me 'cause lovin' you's
A happy state of mind.
Maybe I don't need you quite as much
As I profess to need you baby
But don't leave me needin' you's
A happy state of mind.
And who's to say anyway
That love is not a game we play
Why's it always gotta be considered
A condition of the heart. hmm hmm
As long as I feel warm inside
Wanted filled and satisfied
Who am I to be denied this feelin'
Be it love or be it just a happy state of mind.
Maybe it's just something I've imagined
In the hours when I'm sleepin'
But don't wake me cause dreamin' is
A happy state of mind.
Maybe I just gotta have somebody
And you're close and you're somebody
But don't leave me you've put me in
A happy state of mind.
And who's to say anyway
That love is not a game we play
Why's it always gotta be considered
A condition of the heart. hmm hmm
As long as I feel warm inside
Wanted filled and satisfied
Who am I to be denied this feelin'
Be it love or be it just a happy state of mind.
You've put me in a happy state of mind
Lovin' you's a happy state of mind
Havin' you's a happy state of mind
Don't take away my happy state of mind <start> Every Sunday I see people filing in through those front doors
Got a cross up on that steeple yeah it's time to praise the Lord
Some watch it on their TV sittin' on the couch
Me I get in my old Bronco and point those headlights out
Oh ain't got too many miles to go to save my soul
Hey I go down and sink my feet in the water
And I soak up that sun and I watch it set
Yeah I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel
I'm as close to God as I can get
Whoah
Whoah
Yeah yeah yeahhh
Now there ain't nothing wrong with puttin' on your Sunday best
Me I won't be wearin' nothin' that I can't get wet
I just think about how small I am and life after we're gone
I'm out here by myself
But I know I'm not alone
Yeah I got all the proof I need
And it sure makes me believe
When I go down and sink my feet in the water
And I soak up that sun and I watch it set
Yeah I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel
I'm as close to God as I can get
Whoah
Whoah
Yeah yeah yeahhh
Amen
I'm in heaven watchin' all these waves roll in
Amen
When I'm lost I know where to get found again
Yeah I go down and sink my feet in the water
And I soak up that sun and I watch it set
Yeah I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel
I'm as close to God as I can get
Yeah I go down and sink my feet in the water

Yeah I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel
I'm as close to God as I can get
Whoah

Yeah yeah yeahhh <start> Two partners went in search of gold as friendly as could be
One was young and one was old and the gay young fool was me
Since neighter one could write his name we swore upon our souls
To share the wealth and then shook hands the hands that dug for gold
The summer days were gone at last and winter nights grew cold
The snow had trapped us in the pass when we finally find the gold
We took our fortune to the shack to wait the winter through
But the food ran low so I killed my friend what else there was to do
I threw his body just outside into the bitter cold
Somehow I had to stay alive I now had all the gold
But the howling wind just seemed to say you have killed a man
And you'll never get to spend the gold with the blood upon your hands
The cabin's covered now with snow and shelves of food are bare
Satan's waitin' for me now and I'm too cold to care
Is that the devil at the door coming for my soul
Or is it just the old man a looking for his gold <start> IF THE WHOLE WORLD STOPPED LOVIN'

  ' Shelby Singleton Music 
If the whole world stopped lovin' the way you stopped lovin' me
Have you ever stopped to wonder what kind of place this would be
If the whole world stopped lovin' the way you stopped lovin' me
If every heart was broken the way that you broke my own
And the whole world stopped lovin' how long would living go on
Hear the church bells in the steeple as they ring their song through the air
If the whole world stopped lovin' there'd be no steeple bells there
The tears would fill the river till the rivers flooded the sea
If the whole world stopped lovin' the way you stopped lovin' me
If the whole world stopped lovin' the way you stopped lovin' me <start> She cries just a little when she sees him walk away
After all she can't see it any other way
And it's hard when you feel like there's nothing left to lose
She can't help it she sees no excuse
There's no good in her goodbye
There's no tears she hasn't cried
But it's not enough
She needs nothing less than love
Don't say the sacrifice is small
And no one ever has it all
When all she wants is nothing less than love
You can stand in the middle and see it either way
That's just how it is no one ever wants to blame
So she picked up the pieces and pretends she just can't see
All she's looking for is some room to breathe
There's no good in her goodbye
There's no tears she hasn't cried
But it's not enough
She needs nothing less than love
Don't say the sacrifice is small
And no one ever has it all
When all she wants is nothing less than love
She knows better than to wait
Just keep waiting till it's too late
There's no good in her goodbye
There's no tears she hasn't cried
But it's not enough
She needs nothing less than love
Don't say the sacrifice is small
And no one ever has it all
When all she wants is nothing less than love <start> I'm gonna live my life
Like every day's the last
Without a simple goodbye
It all goes by so fast
And now that you're gone
I can't cry hard enough
I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now
I'm gonna open my eyes
And see for the first time
I've let go of you
Like a child letting go of his kite
Oh there it goes up in the sky
There it goes beyond the clouds
For no reason why
I can't cry hard enough
No I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now
Gonna look back in vain
And see you standing there
When all that remains
Is just the empty air
And now that you're gone
I can't cry hard enough
No I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now
There it goes up in the sky
There it goes beyond the clouds
For no reason why
I can't cry hard enough
No I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now
I'm gonna live my life
Like every day's the last
I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now <start> HELLO CENTRAL GIVE ME HEAVEN
WRITER A.P. CARTER
Hello central give me heaven
For I know my mother's there
And you'll find her with the angels
Over on the golden stair
She'll be glad it's me a speaking
Wont you call her for me please
For I surely want to tell her
That we're sad without her here
Hello central give me heaven
For I know my mother's there
You will find her with the angels
Over on the golden stair
Poppa dear is said and lonely
Sobbed the tearful little child
Since momma's gone to heaven
Poppa dear you do not smile
I will speak to her and tell her
That we want her to come home
You just listen while I call her
Call her through the telephone
I will answer just to please her
Yes dear heart I'll soon come home
Kiss me momma it's your darling
Kiss me through the telephone <start> For the life of me will her memory keep on keepin' me awake
This empty pillow by my head is proof you sleep in the bed that you make
Just like a fool I did nothin' nothin' short of helpin' her pack
Wish I could find a way find the words to say
To bring my baby back
I've got a good thing goin' and she ain't slowin' down
A good thing goin' showin' no sign of turnin' around
If I could go back somehow backtrack
I'd undo all I did wrong but I've got a bad feelin' my good thing goin' is a good thing gone
Thought she'd at least call to say that she was ok
While she left me walkin' the floor
Maybe she was long gone long before she ever set foot out that door
I guess over time the love in her heart was overshadowed by her heartaches
She didn't scream or shout she had it all mapped out and she never even tapped the brakes
I've got a good thing goin' and she ain't slowin' down
A good thing goin' showin' no sign of turnin' around
If I could go back somehow backtrack
I'd undo all I did wrong but I've got a bad feelin' my good thing goin' is a good thing gone
There goes my life down that highway
All of my dreams slippin' further away from this broken home
I've gotta put the pieces all back together
I've got a good thing goin' and she ain't slowin' down
A good thing goin' showin' no signs of turnin' around
If I could go back somehow backtrack
I'd undo all I did wrong but I've got a bad feelin' my good thing goin' is a good thing gone
I've got a good thing goin'
I've got a good thing goin' <start> 
Daddy was an old time preacher man
He preacher the word of God throughout the land
He preached so plain a child could understand
Yes Daddy was an old time preacher man
He told the people of he need to pray
He talked about God's wrath and judgement day
He preached about the great eternity
He preached hell so hot that you could feel the heat
Yes Daddy was an old time preacher man
Aunt Leanona would get up to testify
And we'd sing In The Sweet By And By
The we'd sing I'm On My Way To Canaan Land
Yes Daddy was an old time preacher man
Revivals and camp meetings went for weeks
Folks came from all around to hear him preach
Daddy said if one is saved it's worth it all
But the aisles were always filled at altar calls
Yes Daddy was an old time preacher man <start> I'm going to that east pay road

Like confetti everywhere
Hidden sorrows in the dark
You can feel it in the air
The spotlight finds me
I can no longer hide my frown
Say hello to a lover's clown
Distorted mirror images
Turn the good to bad
If that's not the way it is
Why am I so sad
Strangers laughter is the only sound
Silence from a lover's clown
Girl that's me everybody's laughing at
With a big red nose and the tears and the silly act
Comedy tragedy reality
It all plays the same
If you don't want me
Tumbling from the high wire
Without a net
You're saying I'll stop falling for you
But I haven't yet
The spotlight dims and the bigtop's coming down
Curtains o'er the lover's clown
Girl that's me everybodies laughing at
With a big red nose and the tears and the silly act
Comedy tragedy reality
It all plays the same
If you don't want me
Tiny peices of my heart
Scattered everywhere
Like a fool I played my part
But you were never really there
A new day dawns and the bigtop's leaving town
You can say goodbye to a lover's clown
Say goodbye <start> Well a devil like me needs an angel like you
To really tame me down
'Cause if this devil had an angel like you
I'd stop my runnin' around
I'd stay at home like a good man should
And never ever make you blue
'Cause a devil like me needs an angel like you
You bet your little hearty do
Well I never been one for steady girls
I've always played the field
This warning that warning ever other which one
Was just another spinnin' wheel
But when you've walked in with your big green eyes
And your pretty little dress of blue
I knew a devil like me needs an angel like you
You bet your little hearty do
Well if a devil me had an angel like you
I'd change my reputation
But a devil like me with a shady hairs
Ain't got no recommendation
I give you real love true love a whole lotta sweet love
And I make your every dream come true
Yes a devil like me needs an angel like you
You bet your little hearty do
Well a devil like me needs an angel like you <start> Hello darlin' nice to see you it's been a long time

Except I can't sleep and I cry all night till dawn

And I'm so sorry that I did you wrong

Let me hold you in my arms one more time
Thank you darlin' may God bless you may each step you take

To lose these mem'ries of love so warm and true
And if you should ever find it in your heart to forgive me
Come back darlin' I'll be waiting for you <start> Why did you have to be so good
When you didn't mean to stay
Why did you have to be so good
If you were leaving anyway
You left impressions on my heart and in my mind
Of a love I'd never had
You loved me just long enough to make me blind
To all the hurt and pain that I had in the past
Why did you have to be so good
When you didn't mean to stay
Why did you have to be so good
If you were leaving anyway
You make me feel a way I've never felt before
You even promised me a dream
You were all that I had
Ever had and more <start> Sometimes I cry when you don't call
I'm beginning to say you don't love me at all
But you're still my baby I want the whole world to know
I just love you baby I love you so
Friends all try to tell me that I'm just a fool
Your love don't mean a thing
But I keep hopin' someday you'll see things in my way

Then I'll have you you'll keep me gay we'll be alone both night and day
So tell everybody I want the whole world to know
I just love you baby I love you so

These old bones will tell your story
These old bones will never lie
These old bones will tell you surely
What you can't see with your eye
These old bones I shake and rattle
These old bones I toss and roll
And it's all in where they scatter
Tells you what the future holds
Oh she lived up on the mountain
Eleven miles or so from town
With a oneeyed cat named Wink
A billy goat and a blue tick hound
Her graying hair was braided
And wrapped around her head
And her dress was long and faded
And her home a rusty shed
In a little pouch of burlap
Tied with a piece of twine
There were bones all shapes and sizes
Gathered through the course of time
She'd throw them out before you
She swore that she could see
The present past and future
She could ready your destiny
Everybody knew about her
Came to get their fortune read
Concerning health and wealth and power
Who to love and when to wed
Well I just like helpin' people
I'm just glad that I could help
Why I know everybody's secrets
But I keep it to myself
These old bones will tell your story
These old bones will never lie
These old bones will tell you surely
What you can't see with your eye
These old bones I shake and rattle
These old bones I toss and roll
And it's all in where they scatter
Tells you what the future holds
Some called her witchy woman
Some said she was insane
Some said she was a prophet
Still everybody came
Just because a body's different
Well that don't make 'em mad
Well they've crucified a many
For the special gifts they've had
I had often heard about her
Dreamed about her now and then
For I too was clairvoyant
Came about when I was ten
I was fascinated with her
And the things I'd heard about
And I knew some day I'd meet her
And one day it came about
Well I know'd that you 'uz a'comin'
I could feel it in my bones
These old bones have also told me
That I won't be here for long
Did you know that you 'uz adopted
Did you know you once't was mine
But the county took you from me
Said I wasn't right in mind
But I just know'd I had to see you
'Fore these bones was laid to rest
So I conjured up a message
It must'a worked I guess
This gift runs in the family
I know you also know
And I passed this gift on to you
These old bones they're just for show
These old bones will tell your story
These old bones will never lie
These old bones will tell you surely
How to live and when you'll die
These old bones I shake and rattle
These old bones I toss and roll
And it's all in where they scatter
Tells you what the future holds
I held her hand while she was dyin'
And with the funeral through
I headed on back up the mountain
For Billy Wink and Blue
And that little pouch of burlap
With those bones so worn and old
She give me somethin' special
Now every time I throw
These old bones will tell your story
These old bones will never lie
These old bones will tell you surely
What you can't see with your eye
These old bones I shake and rattle
These old bones I toss and roll
And it's all in how they scatter
Tells you what the future holds
Now I can't tell you what you want to hear
I just tell you what I see
It's these old bones a'talkin'
Blame it on them don't pack it on me
It's just like that time that there boy died
Up at the sawmill
Well I know'd who done it but I never said
And I know'd when somebody is a cheatin'
Or when somebody's baby was gonna be born dead
But unless somebody just plain out and asked me
Well I just figured there ain't no point goin' around actin' like you know everything just 'cause you might.
Ah you know girl I want you to take these bones
'Cause I don't want no young'un of mine a'going around unprepared
You just remember that the magic is inside you
There ain't no crystal ball <start> I wish you packed your things and cursed my name
and slammed the door behind you.
But instead you took my hand and tried to help me understand.
How dare you
There's really nothing more to say.
So I'm going to smoke anything that burns
drink everything they serve.
Set 'em up and knock them down
just to forget you.
I'll go numb to all this hurt.
Drown the memory of what we were
at the bottom of this bottle if I have to
I'll pretend I never loved you.
Sitting in this corner booth where I met you
just acting like I don't miss it.
I never wanted this but now I wish our first kiss never happened.
Lord I just need to put the past away.
So I'm going to smoke anything that burns
drink everything they serve.
Set 'em up and knock them down
just to forget you.
I'll go numb to all this hurt.
Drown the memory of what we were
at the bottom of this bottle if I have to
I'll pretend I never loved you.
I'll pretend I never loved you.
Ooooh
I'll pretend I never loved you.
You make it look so easy
getting by without me.
Like you never missed a beat.
I'm going to smoke anything that burns
drink everything they serve.
Set 'em up and knock them down
and just forget you.
I'll go numb to all this hurt.
Drown the memory of what we were

When you love somebody with all your heart and soul
And you want to keep them with you but you know they want to go
What do you do what do you say
When you know they want to leave
As bad as you want them to stay
And there's nothing quite as sad as a onesided love
When one doesn't care at all and the other cares too much
It's a sad situation I must say
When you know they want to leave
As bad as you want them to stay
You know how much I love you
But I know you don't love me
And I know it's just a matter of time before you leave
But I do I stand aside and just let you walk away
But I know you want to leave
As bad as I want you to stay <start> One man come in the name of love
One man come and go
One man come here to justify
One man to overthrow
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resist
One man washed on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
Early morning April 
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky
Free at last they took your life
They could not take your pride
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love <start> You caged the wild man that raged inside me
Took a hell bent cowboy made his hands sure and steady
But today when you walked out what was I gonna do
But reach for the closest thing I could hold on to
Yeah I'm taking this heartache with a grain of salt
A little lime and tequila as the teardrops fall
And I'm gonna sit here until I chase every memory off
I'm taking this heartache with a grain of salt
Sittin' in the shadows as the sun goes down
A little loose change will buy another round
Oh come tomorrow morning there'll be a high price to pay
Oh but that's all right because tonight I ain't feeling no pain
Yeah I'm taking this heartache with a grain of salt
A little lime and tequila as the teardrops fall
And I'm gonna sit here until I chase every memory off
I'm taking this heartache with a grain of salt <start> So your heart's been broke
And your head is hurtin'
And the things you're tryin'
None of them are workin'
For a guy like you
In such a blue condition
I know what you need
There's only one prescription
Put some alcohol on it
Put some alcohol on it
It's real good stuff
It will fix you right up
Burns a little don't it
But you know you're gonna want it
When you're cut and bruised
The only thing to do
Put some alcohol on it
You don't need to see
Your family doctor
What I'm recommending
Is a better offer
It's a whole lot cheaper
It will heal you faster
In a while her being gone
Won't even matter
Put some alcohol on it
Put some alcohol on it
It's real good stuff
It will fix you right up
Burns a little don't it
But you know you're gonna want it
When you're cut and bruised
The only thing to do
Put some alcohol on it <start> You reach out and touch me and tell me you love me
And promise that you always will
But as i start to kiss your tender lips
I wake up to my living hell
These sweet dreams are killin' me
Your heavenly memory is pure misery
I'm losing my mind one night as a time
These sweet dreams are killin' me
When sleep comes i hold you just like i used to
In a world where our love still lives
But each mornin' i wake as i feel my heart break
When i lose you all over again
These sweet dreams are killin' me
Your heavenly memory is pure misery
I'm losing my mind one night as a time
These sweet dreams are killin' me
These sweet dreams are killin' me
These sweet dreams are killin' me <start> Well my friend you ask me what to do
If I were you and feeling blue
I know inside that you still care
You want her here but she's out there
Don't leave her lonely too long
'Cause she'll be gone gone gone
Don't leave her lonely too long
'Cause she'll be gone gone gone
You still have time to change her mind
She needs to know the way you feel
And there could be no better time
You've got to show her your love is real
Don't leave her lonely too long
'Cause she'll be gone gone gone
Don't leave her lonely too long
'Cause she'll be gone gone gone
There's strangers waiting in line
To take your place and leave you behind
And then too late you'll change your mind
Your heart will break a million times
Don't leave her lonely too long
'Cause she'll be gone gone gone
Don't leave her lonely too long
'Cause she'll be gone gone gone
She'll be gone gone gone <start> I wake up in the morning full of dread
Trying to remember what I said
I say that I won't call you
And I mean it every time
Until I cross that Bourbon borderline
I wish that I could tell you why I call
Sometimes it's just hard for me that's all
I know that it's over and it's just a waste of time
Until I cross that Bourbon borderline
Memories of you surround me and
I'm afraid the tears might drown me
I think I'm doing fine
Until I cross that Bourbon borderline
It's good that I just do this now and then
You know I'm really not a drinking man
 I can't bear to talk about us any other time
Until I cross that Bourbon borderline <start> Sittin' up on the roof
Sneakin' a smoke by the chimney
Checkin' out the moon
And the city lights
He takes off his flannel shirt and he
Drapes it around her shoulders
He slides up behind her and holds on tight
And she says
I don't want this night to end
Why does it have to end
Tomorrow she'll be rollin' down I
Baton Rouge LSU
Eighteen years in her rearview
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop
It ain't much but it's a job
They've been dreadin' this moment all summer long
The night before
Life goes on
Ooo a tear falls off her cheek and
Right when it hits his arm he says
Come on baby let's get out of here.
They take one last drive around town
And man it already looks different
He bangs the wheel and says
Life ain't fair
And this growin' up stuff man I don't know
I just don't wanna let you go.
Tomorrow she'll be rollin' down I
Baton Rouge LSU
Eighteen years in her rearview
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop
It ain't much but it's a job
They've been dreadin' this moment all summer long
The night before
Life goes on
Yeah that's what my mama told me
And just like those kids
I didn't wanna listen to no one
Yeah there's nothin' you can do
There's nothin' you can say
And I know how it feels when love goes away
Tomorrow she'll be rollin' down I
Baton Rouge LSU
Eighteen years in her rearview
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop
It ain't much but it's a job
They've been dreadin' this moment all summer long
But here it is
They don't have long
The night before
Life goes on yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah <start> He grew up in a time
When a thirdgrade education
Was all the school you needed
To work the family farm.
He'd take time off on Sunday
Him and all his family
warm a pew
And give thanks to the Lord.
There was no gray only black and white.
Didn't need noone to tell him
What was wrong or right.
'Cause he had God Family and Country.
He set aside his plow
In early 
Said goodbye to his small town
And put on the Army green.
Hard Times on the front lines
Writin' letters on wet paper
Not one word about the awful things he'd seen.
His was a generation
That answered without question.
They knew they had to win
'Cause they were fightin' for...
God Family and Country.
On the coffee table
Sits the family Bible
Where just last year he added
A little boy to the family tree.
There's the folded flag they gave us
On the day he left us.
But the thing that I remember most
Is the way that he...
Believed...
In God Family and Country...
Ohhh we've got God...
Family...
And Country...... <start> All these little victories yeah
All these little victories yeah
Look at the angel high up above the ground
She must've burned her wings now afraid to come down
Far below things are looking bad
Lines have got crossed and the world's gone mad today
I'm stuck in Texas and I'm trying to reach L.A.
All these little victories yeah
All these little victories yeah
Well it seems to me the older we get
The more we see the more we forget
The way history goes round and round
It's kinda funny but right now I don't feel like laughing out loud
All these little victories yeah
All these little victories yeah
We thought we come so far
But we're yet to win the war yet to win the war
But I wish that angel high in the air would cry to God all mightiest
Incomprehensible got to Pasadena
Would watch that go down cynically well okay okay okay okay
You see I'm stuck in Texas and I'm trying to reach L.A.
All these little victories yeah

 <start> Touch my heart feel the hurt it's destroying me
I've tried but I can't seem to shake his memory
Touch my heart feel the hurt the pain and misery
And tell me again what love can do for me
If you lived in my world awhile you'd soon forget how to smile
For in my world there's a million ways to cry
If you had my eyes you could see how someone changed my destiny
I'm the one who can't live and yet can't die
Touch my heart...
Then tell me again what love can do for me <start> Momma sure was right
In her preachins' on the backwoods life
She said it's sure as the sun goes down and the sun comes up
In the hearts of Hillbillies
And the souls of Big Cities
There's a common ground as strong as in God we trust
It's hip to be country
Dope to be downhome
Alright to be righteous
Legit to get stuck and sling a little mud
It's fly to be the farmhand
Pimp to be the poor man
Cool to be free as the breeze
And hip to be country
It's as soakin' as rain
Smokin' as a coal train
It's stars and bars that bleed red white and blue
It's the sound of a holler
Jumpin' in the muddy waters
And its why I hang my hat neath' an ole tin roof
Its hip to be country
Dope to be downhome
Alright to be righteous
Legit to get stuck and sling a little mud
It's fly to be the farmhand
Pimp to be the poor man
Cool to be free as the breeze
And hip to be country
It's groovy to feel like me

I believe what the wise men say love's not love till you give it away
And there's nothing like giving love to you you're my only dream that's ever come true
The Lord made you for me to love you love you every day
Love's not love till you give it away
 steel 
A kite's not a kite till you fly it a bow's not a bow till you tie it
I believe what the wise men say love's not love till you give it away
And there's nothing like...
Love's not love till you give it away <start> Your letter came this very day and it wiped all my dreams away
I've read it o'er a thousand times it's left me with a worried mind
I wonder why you said goodbye and did you mean to make me cry
I guess until the day I die that I will still be wondering why
 steel 
I'd read the thought that we are through and that you found somebody new
I love you now I always will I'd rather die than say farewell

I hope and pray before my time that you'll come back and say you're mine
Bring back the love you took away and mend the heart you broke today
I wonder why you said goodbye... <start> I'm driving in my car alone
You called me on the telephone
How many times will it take till I'm convinced
That you're using me I'm just a usedtobe
It's a lie I know it's a lie
But I just can't go on dying like this
Can I see you tonight
Baby I'll act just like you want me to
Or is that just exactly what I'm not supposed to do
I'll just stop in here have a glass of beer
I'm just a fool I guess
But I just can't go on dying like this
Here I am again it's four AM
I think I'll play that song again
The one called I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry
And I'll wonder where you are tonight
I don't know I just don't know
But I just can't go on dying like this
Can I see you tonight
Baby I'll act just like you want me to
Or is that just exactly what I'm not supposed to do
I'll just stop in here have a glass of beer
I'm just a fool I guess
But I just can't go on dying like this
Lord knows I just can't go on dying like this <start> Remember when I saw you standing slightly cryin' emptyhanded
With no one that you could call your own
Looking up to someone somewhere asking for life with no despair
Begging for the world to leave you alone
Yes I shouldn't have butted in but you looked as if you could use a friend
And I'd lost one myself and was looking about
Remember it was kinda crazy I held my hand out you took it baby
For a while we helped each other out
Remember how I dried every tear that you cried
And gave you love to trust beyond a doubt
And whenever I was down you made me laugh brought me around
Yeah for a while we helped each other out
And early one day in the morning sun that time came we knew would come
And in our hearts well there was love no more
I guess we're just two of that kind that look for life but never find
The love in mind that we were looking for
But I always have the warm spot for you cause at one time I adored you
And if I pass this way again I'll shout
May be years 'fore I come through but when I do I'll call on you
Cause at one time we helped each other out
At one time we helped each other out <start> One two
Got up this morning headed down the road
I saw this pilgrim with a heavy load
Were my eyes lyin' at what I'd seen
Hello stranger. Remember me
Hang your coat on that nail
Kick your shoes off let 'em sail
I set my suitcase down in the den
Welcome stranger come on in
Come on in come on in
It's so good to see you again
It don't matter where you been
Welcome stranger come on in
I'll make the coffee I'll get the cream
We'll open up a bottle of old Jim Beam
We'll hoot and holler to your favorite song
Welcome stranger welcome home
I sure did miss you there's no doubt
The days got longer after you checked out
But the pain got stronger when it kicked in
Welcome stranger come on in
Come on in come on in
It's so good to see you again
It don't matter where you been
Welcome stranger come on in
It don't matter where you been
Welcome stranger come on in
Welcome stranger come on in <start> We live in two different worlds dear
That's why we're so far apart
You made your world out of vows that were broken
I built the world in my heart
Everyone here tried to warn me
You were just a playing game
I told them all we were made for each other
I thought our worlds were the same
We live in two different worlds dear <start> The stillness here
Like what he sometimes finds inside her
Hits so hard it can steal your breath forever
He sometimes wonders
Is the sum of their lives together
Him on the floor and her lost to a mind in tatters
These days he's drinking for the pleasure of falling
And he's falling for the pleasure of pretending
That she's sitting by the window waiting
For him to come calling
If I could fix me up a week of twilight hours
We'd sit on the point
And watch the sun continually flounder
Bathed in gold we'd plug into some kind of power
And connect with those days
Back before all of this went sour
'Cause I'm drinking for the pleasure of falling
And I'm falling for the pleasure of pretending
That you're sitting by the window waiting
For me to come calling
Odd how the darkness always makes us whisper
And with the last of the sun
You can feel the approach of the winter
Now is the time of each day
That I Desperately miss her
I suppose I will learn how to live my life without her
So you're drinking for the pleasure of falling
And you're falling for the pleasure of pretending
That I'm sitting by the window waiting
For you to come calling <start> Sweeter than the grapes growin' out in California
Softer than the fuzz on the sweetest Georgia peach
Warms you goin' down like a twentytwo year old brandy
When she loves me Lord she's fine fine as wine
She loves her rodeo man turns him every way but loose
Washes out all his Levis shines his cowboy boots
Watches him each Saturday bitin' the dust again
She takes him home puts him to bed and rubs in the lineament
She's sweeter than the grapes growin' out in California
Softer than the fuzz on the sweetest Georgia peach
Warms you goin' down like a twentytwo year old brandy
When she loves me Lord she's fine fine as wine
Layin' in the back seat with sugar at the wheel
Broken bones from my last ride is all my head can feel
Sugar sure gets tired Lord of all I put her through
But I'll never find another gal who's sweeter or is true
She's sweeter than the grapes growin' out in California
Softer than the fuzz on the sweetest Georgia peach
Warms you goin' down like a twentytwo year old brandy
When she loves me Lord she's fine fine as wine
Sweeter than the grapes growin' out in California
Softer than the fuzz on the sweetest Georgia peach
Warms you goin' down like a twentytwo year old brandy
When she loves me Lord she's fine fine as wine <start> Ten years ago on a cool dark night
There was someone killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene but they all did agree
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me
The judge said Son what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word although it meant my life
For I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
The scaffold is high and eternity is neared
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil she cries over my bones <start> Look around little darlin' do you know who I am
I'm as much your reflection as I am my own man
You need not to defend love life's the house where we live
We cannot see tomorrow only feel what we give
Put your head on my shoulders dry the tears from your eyes
Watch the sun's fadin' ember hear the wind as she cries
We talk and hear about loneliness
The cold blue hunger of the soul
But if this world has redemptiveness
Why ever should we be somewhere
Where there's nowhere to go
Put your head on my shoulders dry the tears from your eyes
Watch the sun's fadin' ember hear the wind as she cries
Hear the wind as she cries <start> Now I like candy and I like cake and I like jam but goodness sake
There's nothing as sweet as my baby
She got golden hair and big blue eyes she could win a beauty prize
There's nothing as sweet as my baby
If I ever lose her I'll lay me down and die
If sugar seems sweet then you oughta meet my honey coated sweetie pie
I like candy and I like cake and I like jam but goodness sake
There's nothing as sweet as my baby
 guitar  steel 
Now I like candy and I like cake and I like jam but goodness sake
There's nothing as sweet as my baby
I'll be like a honeybee when she's buzzin' round with me
There's nothing as sweet as my baby
Got pounds of candy kisses but I can't spare an ounce
She's sweeter than wine and brother she's mine
And that's the only thing that counts
I like candy and I like cake and I like jam but goodness sake
There's nothing as sweet as my baby <start> I was born when I met you
Now I'm dying to forget you
And that is what I know
Though I dreamed I would fall
Like a wounded cannonball
Sinking down with my heart in tow
Bright lights like white lightning
Who shot me down
Who will cut me down
I'm frozen in my bed till the day comes around
How I'm lost
How I'm found
There's a man all alone
Telling me his friends are gone
That they've died and flown away
So I told him he was wrong
That you friends are never gone
If you look to the sky and pray
Bright lights like white lightning
Who shot me down
Who will cut me down
I'm frozen in my bed till the day comes around
How I'm lost
How I'm found
Someone told me a lie
Someone looked me in the eye
And said time will ease your pain
But behold when you fall
It's that same old cannonball
Coming back for your heart again
Bright lights like white lightning
Who shot me down
Who will cut me down
I'm frozen in my bed till the day comes around
And it may come around
Until the day comes around
How I'm lost
How I'm found
I was born when I met you
Now I'm dying to forget you
And that is what I know <start> Here comes old life of the party Charlie he's a funny funny man
And every party Charlie is the life
Everyone's in love with the life of the party Charlie settin' me
And I love Charlie's wife
Everytime there's party old Charlie always there
Cuttin' up and acting like a clown
Whenever there's a party you won't find me there
I'll bee out with Charlie's wife on the other side of town
Here comes old life of the party...
If you're gonna throw a party have old Charlie come around
He's a lot of fun so he won't mind
But don't bother asking me I'll be busy as can be
With the swinging little party that Charlie leave behind
Here comes old life of the party...
Here comes old life of the party... <start> Love oh love careless love
Love oh love careless love
Love oh love oh careless love
See what careless love has done
Once I wore my apron low
Once I wore my apron low
Once I wore my apron low
I couldn't keep you from my door
What oh what will mama say
What oh what will mama say
What oh what will mama say
When she learns I've gone astray
I love my mama and papa too
I love my mama and papa too
I love my mama and papa too
See what I get for lovin' you <start> I don't know how it happened but it did
I don't know why it's over but it is
I don't know where it comes from when it's on
I don't know where it goes to but It's gone
You used to brush my mind with tender thoughts
We could say it all and never talk
But lately our love's only flesh and bone
I don't know where it went to but it's gone
Chorus
We used to light the darkness up
Make love without a touch
Be ourselves and never be alone
Somethin' lived between us then
I always thought would never end
But like the wind I guess it just moved on
I don't know where it went to but it's gone
I don't understand it but I know
The blush of love once bright no longer glows
And I can't put it back by hangin' on
I don't know where it went to but it's gone
Chorus
I don't know where it went to but it's gone <start> Please help me I'm falling in love with you
Close the door to temptation don't let me walk through
Turn away from me darling I'm begging you do
Please help me I'm falling in love with you
I belong to another whose love has grown cold
But I promised forever to have and to hold
So I can never be free dear but when I'm with you
I know that I'm losing the strength to be true
Please help me I'm falling and that would be sin
Close the door to temptation don't let me walk in
For I shouldn't want you but darling I do
Please help me I'm falling in love with you
Please help me I'm falling in love with you <start> We got a bucket of Corona

He hopes he prays
He laughs he cries
A man tries his best
Sometimes he falls
A man does what he has to do
And a woman does too
A mand wants to love
With all his heart
He's not afraid
A man needs someone to share his life
He wants someone to hold at night
Like baby I do
Yeah a woman does too
Chorus
So baby lay down here beside me
Sometimes a man just needs two arms to fall into
And if you wanna know the truth
A woman does too
A man has to be strong
Standing tall
To make his way
A man takes on the world
Holds his ground
He has so much he has to prove
And a woman does too
Chorus
So baby lay down here beside me
Sometimes a man just needs two arms to fall into
And if you wanna know the truth
A woman does too
A woman does too
This woman does too <start> Wish I could stop these tears I wish I didn't care wish I didn't love you anymore
Wish I could be set free from all your memories wish I didn't love you anymore
But if wishing really made it so I'd have the different wish I know
I'd wish you still love me just like you did before
But that wish can't come true so all that I can do is wish I didn't love you anymore
Wish I could just forget that we had ever met wish I didn't love you anymore
How I wish I didn't love you anymore <start> Silence is golden my love tell me now with your eyes
No need to speak just let me see your eyes look love to me
Silently place your warm hand in mine
Safe and secure from the troubles of our time
Say with your eyes what you feel deep inside
Words cannot express they only hide
Silence is golden my love eyes are windows of one's heart
Look into mine find peace of mind that you and I will never part
Who needs words when we are so near
Silence please just let me hold you dear silence is golden my love <start> Sittin' in the shade made by a hay truck on a hot day
A cloud of dust on an old dirt road meant lemonade was on the way
She was beautiful
And her daddy said that I made a good hand
We laid there on the ground as the sun went down
On the shadows of the heartland
I helped her daddy fix up his old beat up red Ford pickup
Had her shinin' like a diamond
He said Climb behind the wheel son
She was beautiful
Said Take her slow as he placed the keys in my hand
And dancin in the headlights that night
Shadows of the heartland
Heaven can't be far away
From the fields of gold where I was raised
Where the sun shines bright but the light comes from the word
Where you know you reap the seeds you sow
You count your blessings row by row
And sweat and blood and tears and love still work
The life I live the love I give the man I am
Shadows of the heartland
Friday night lights shinin' bright
The last game of the season
We were just one play away from being undefeated
The pass was beautiful
But somehow that ball slipped right through my hands
She was there to hold me close when it turned cold
In the shadows of the heartland
Heaven can't be far away
From the fields of gold where I was raised
Where the sun shines bright but the light comes from the word
Where you know you reap the seeds you so
You count your blessings row by row
And sweat and blood and tears and love still work
The life I live the love I give the man I am
Shadows of the heartland
Amazin' grace and a place to plow
That what her dad was all about
Wish he was with us now
Heaven can't be far away
From the fields of gold where I was raised
Where the sun shines bright but the light comes from the word
Where you know you reap the seeds you so
You count your blessings row by row
And sweat and blood and tears and love still work
The life I live the love I give the man I am
Shadows of the heartland
Shadows of the heartland <start> She stands on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
Alone in the pale moonlight
Waitin' for a man a riverboat gambler
Said that he'd return tonight
They used to waltz on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
Lovin' the whole night through
He was a riverboat gambler off to make a killin'
And bring it on back to you
Evangeline Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi queen
That pulled her man away
Bayou Sam from south Louisiana'
Had gamblin' in his veins
Evangeline from the maritime
Was slowly goin' insane
High on the top of a hickory hill
She stands in the lightning and thunder
Down on the river the boat was a sinkin'
She watched that queen go under
Evangeline Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi queen
That pulled her man away
Evangeline Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi queen
That pulled her man away <start> After the war was over I was coming home to you
I saw a rainbow at midnight out on the ocean blue
The stars up in heaven were shining the moon gave its light from above
I saw your face in this rainbow and it made me think of our love
We'll build our home in the country and make all our dreams come true
There we will make a heaven sweetheart just for we two
Here we will live so happy and have a baby or two
We'll name them after the rainbow because it reminds me of you
After this life is over and our journey here is through
We'll move to the land of the rainbow and live in the starry blue
And live in the starry blue <start> They say you've found somebody new
But that won't stop my lovin' you
I just can't let you walk away
Forget the love I had for you
Guess I could find somebody too
But I don't want no one but you
How could you leave without regret
Am I that easy to forget
Before you leave be sure you find
You want his love much more than mine
'Cause I'll just say we've never met
If I'm that easy to forget
Before you leave be sure you find
You want his love much more than mine
'Cause I'll just say we've never met
If I'm that easy to forget <start> Seems like almost everyday
Trouble carries us away
And sometimes when we hurt we all need to be saved
Every time I'm in to deep
Someone always rescue me
Its like heavens sending down the help that I need
Life like a chain sometimes it breaks
We all need a hand when we fall from grace
It could be someone walking down the street
A stranger on a bus
A little kid on his way to school or any one of us
We all got a little superman ready to take a fly
And save a life ohh save a life
Take a look around and you'll see ordinary angels
The world can make you feel so small
Steal your dreams and make you crawl
And break you till you got you got nothing at all
When your in that dark place and you need that embrace
You know love is never to far away
It could be a waitress at coffee shop you never saw before
A soldier that's just coming home from fighting in the war
We all got a little superman ready to take a fly
And save a life ohh save a life
Take a look around and you'll see ordinary angels <start> When we were young along the Mississippi life was never lonely way back then
We'd need each other down along the dirt road
And go for walk so along the river bend
I bought some ground along the Mississippi and told you of my plans that lay ahead
But you were dreaming all about big city and far off places in the books you read
Now when leaves fall down along the Mississippi I look back north into the chilly wind
I wait and watch for you along the dirt road and wonder if you're coming back again
I built a house along the Mississippi and longing for the day when we would wed
I waited for you down along the dirt road but far off places won your heart instead
Now when leaves fall down ...
And wonder if you're coming back again <start> Down in Texas near the DFW among the shrubs and patios and barbecues
Was born a suburban boy named Billy beBad
Had a white bread momma and a rock and roll dad
Didn't have much soul or country roots but he sure looked cute in his cowboy suit
Bbb...Billy Billy be Bad bbb..Billy Billy be Bad
Bbbb... Billy Billy be Bad bbb... Billy Billy be Bad
Bbb...Billy Billy be Bad bbb... Billy Billy be Bad
He can spot a trend and he knows a pad he's a country singer named Billy beBad
He sounds like everybody on the radio he's building up his biceps for the video
The people at the label said we like to start 'em young
We know you're twenty three but we'll say you're twenty one
They played him some Strait they played him some Jones
Now he's got that country music way down in his bones
Bbb... Billy Billy be Bad...
Watch out for your daughters he's gonna drive 'em mad
The country sex symbol called Billy beBad
Now poor ol' Billy's at the end of the line
He's over the hill cause he's pushing twenty nine
He's not as young and he's not as handsome he just tested positive for brandson
He'll never be that hot again look for his music in the oldies bin
Bbb... Billy Billy be Bad...
What a great career he had say goodbye to Billy be Bad <start> Trees are for climbin
And holes are for diggin in
Friends are for when youre havin fun
And hearts are for when you want to love someone
Dogs are for huggin
And cats are for puttin up with
Birds are just lookin at
And heads are for when you have to wear a hat
Dads are for bein with
And doin things and helpin Mom out
And Moms are for talkin to
And telling things that you cant tell anyone
Ears are for hearin your father call
And eyes are for seein when its dark
Legs are for when you have to run
And hearts are for when you want to love someone
Brothers always take your things
And they break your things and eat your candy
And sisters always tell on you
And they cry a lot when they got no reason to
Feet are for puttin your shoes on
And hair is for lookin nice in school
And hands are for foldin when your book is done
And hearts are for when you want to love someone <start> Written by billy burnette.
Just walk on out
And close the door
I don't wanna see you anymore
It was such a shock
Kind of cold conversation
To end such a long
Such a long relation
Plans we have made
Seem oh so beautiful
Now that we're apart
They wouldn't seem so suitable <start> I'll still see you walking silently
Through the shadows in my mind
And a vision of your sweet blue eyes
Creeps into my dreamful sleep tonight
You still haunt the deepness of my memories
I guess you will throughout all time
Little girl I still remember
The very dress you wore on that day
It was so soft a shade of violet
Lord how it took my breath away
As the sunshine on that morning
Broke across your golden hair
How I wished to hold you tightly
Lord but I was shy and did not dare
But I'll still see you walking silently
Through the shadows in my mind
And a vision of your sweet blue eyes
Creeps into my dreamful sleep tonight
You still haunt the deepness of my memories
I guess you will throughout all time
Many nights I've sat and wondered
If you might be somebody's wife
But if you're not I'd long to see you
If just to tell you how I've pined
I've been known to ask strangers
That I thought might just pass your way
They would tell you of these feelings
We might meet again someday
But I'll still see you walking silently
Through the shadows in my mind
And a vision of your sweet blue eyes
Creeps into my dreamful sleep tonight
Yeah you still haunt the deepness of my memories
I guess you will throughout all time
You still haunt the deepness of my memories
I guess you will throughout all time <start> My little boy on the kitchen floor

Stick men fighting stick dinosaurs

Colors leaping all over the mat

The kitchen floor is where it's at
For my little Basquiat
One day he'll be golden
Maybe chosen perhaps to lead
One day he'll be shaken
Maybe taken perhaps to bleed
My big girl swinging from the bars

Fist of stone flying above the yard

Halfway up is halfway down

Now maybe it's the other way around
For my little comaniche
One day she'll be moonlight
Maybe too bright perhaps to shine
One day she'll be found out
Maybe ground down perhaps she'll cry
My little girl on her mother's lap

Sucking on her fingers surveying the road map

Seems to be the only one around

That sees the red lights at the end of town
My little panchen lama
One day they'll be older
Maybe bolder perhaps than me
One day they'll be rising
Maybe living perhaps in peace
One day they'll be older
Maybe bolder perhaps than me
One day they'll be rising
Maybe living perhaps in peace
Perhaps in peace
Perhaps in peace
Perhaps in peace <start> When we had our fights
I knew that our love wouldn't last that long
So when you broke my heart
I knew I'd have to leave town all alone
And 'cause I was so mad
I didn't wanna see your face again
Now I'm  miles from Alice
And I'm thousands of miles from my home.
Now people seem to ask
Why I'm always crying all the time
But I don't speak of faded love
So I just walk away and say that I'll be fine
My heart is broke in two
And my eyes will cry a river of love
Yes I'm  miles from Alice
And I'm thousands of miles from my home.
Now when I sleep at night
Well I pray that when I wake I'll be at home
But when the morning comes
Well I lie and I cry 'cause I was wrong
But I'm oh so far away
And I'm out of town and oh so far from home
Yes I'm  miles from Alice
And I'm thousands of miles from my home.
Yes I'm  miles from Alice
And I'm thousands of miles from my home. <start> Healing herself
Healing the world and me as well
We rarely see how far we shine
She's digging in
Seeking her answers there within
Leaving a younger girl behind
Mary is on her way to womanhood
Mary is on her way to home
Mary is like a play
Can't read ahead
More to be said
Mary is like a living koan
Mary Christmas
Mary New Year
Mary let your heart be known
Caring for strays
Seems like that's always been her way
She sees what other people don't
She took me in
Knew when I needed most a friend
Room to defend and room to grow
Mary is on her way to womanhood
Mary is on her way to home
Mary is like a play
Can't read ahead
More to be said
Mary is like a living koan
Mary Christmas
Mary New Year
Mary let your heart be known <start> You lover leaver
You can haunt the kids you'll bring
Golden retriever
You wear a cross around your neck
Hiding all alone in your old home
We can go into the bed if you want
Set the wheel in motion
Let it roll right off you desk
Fixated notion
When your gone there's nothing left
Hiding all alone in your old home
We can go into the bed if you want
Honey there's a time and place for us
I'll be standing in line
People always laugh but I don't even give a fuck
You nearly killed my spirit
When I heard about your death
And I don't wanna hear it
It gets cold I feel your breath
Hiding all alone in your old home
We can go into the bed if you want
Honey there's a time and place for us
But all you do is cry
Cause you're stuck inside a grey
Baby there just ain't enough <start> A big hearted me big hearted me big hearted me
A big hearted me had to go give 'em my love away
I give it to a girl that broke it in two like it was plain
I should have known better should I never let her
But I couldn't break free
I give her all my love so gently
A big hearted me big hearted me big hearted me
Bought her everything mink and a ring oh so fine
I thought she loved me so there never was a doubt
That she was mine
Till one day opened my eyes plain as could be
My love was all gone she left me all alone a big hearted me
A big hearted me big hearted me
A big hearted me big hearted me big hearted me <start> He had plastic bags wrapped round his shoes
He was covered with the evening news
Had a pair of old wool socks on his hands
The bank sign was flashing  below
It was freezing rain an spittin' snow
He was curled up behind some garbage cans
I was afraid that he was dead
I gave him a gentle shake
When he opened up his eyes
I saidOld man are you ok
He saidI just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
I was runin' from some honey bees
Drip dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
Cause I was almost home
Then he saidI was comin' round the barn
Bout the time he grabbed my arm
When I heard Momma holler son hurry up
I was close enough for my own nose
To smell fresh cobbler on the stove
When I saw daddy loadin' up the truck
Cane poles on the tailgate
Bobbers blowin' in the wind
Since July of '
That's as close as I've been
He saidI just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
I was runin' from some honey bees
Drip dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
Cause I was almost home
I saidold man you're gonna freeze to death
Let me drive you to a mission
He saidBoy if you left me alone
Right now I'd be fishin'
He saidI just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
I was runin' from some honey bees
Drip dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
Cause I was almost home
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
Cause I was almost home 
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
I wish almost home <start> From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
From the queen of flowing mountains to the south bells by the moor
She's mighty tall and handsome and known quite well by all
She's the combination on the Wabash Cannonball
She came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
There's a gal from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodlands through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear that lonesome hobo's call
Traveling through the Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball
Our eastern states are dandy so the people always say
From New York to St Louis and Chicago by the way
From the hills of Minnesota where the rippling waters fall
No changes can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball
So here's to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
And always be remembered in the ports of Alabama
His earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall
We'll carry him home to Victory on the Wabash Cannonball
Now listen to the jingle unverified <start> Our little girl taken sick one evening
As she walked home from school
And in her death bed soon bring her
It made us so sad and so blue
Then she called me close to her bedside
And whispered these words soft and low
Tell Mommy to come to me quickly
I want to kiss you both then go
I hear a sweet voice calling
Way up in heaven on high
God has made room for you daughter
Oh Mommy and Daddy don't cry
Take care of my little brother
Tell him I've gone to rest
I know his little heart is broken
He's all that you have left <start> Would you believe this blacktop highway
Used to be a onelane gravel road
Back when Johnny Cash was just somebody
Daddy went to school with years ago
When the cottonwoods reached to the sky
An' honeysuckle vine grew all around
My eyes well up with memories
Every time I think about this little ol' town
'Cause I know there's bigger cities
Full of all the sights and sounds
Where people live in fear an' lock their doors
Long before the sun goes down
The drivein picture show's been closed for years
No superstores or midimalls
But everyday I thank the Lord he made Dyess Arkansas
I used to laugh at all the stories
Daddy'd tell me 'bout the mischief he'd get in
Dream of pennycandy an' nickel sodapops
Lord what a dollar'd buy back then
When livin' life was picture perfect
Like a Norman Rockwell paintin' of the South
Lord I'd give almost anything
To hear my Daddy tell the stories now
He'd say I know there's bigger cities
Full of all the sights and sounds
Where people live in fear an' lock their doors
Long before the sun goes down
The drivein picture show's been closed for years
No superstores or midimalls
Still everyday I thank the Lord he made Dyess Arkansas <start> The day I met you my heart spoke to me it said to love you through eternity
Not knowing that you were another's bride I vowed I'd always be close by your side
You know I love you and I always will I know you're married but I love you still
 fiddle 
You broke a heart dear that would die for you I'd give the world to belong to you
The game is over now I know I've lost my broken heart will have to pay the cost
You know I love you and I always will I know you're married but I love you still <start> Through trials troubles and care
I know Jesus my savior is there
Giving me faith through darkest days
Keeping me on the narrow way
Jesus savior help me each day
Fill me with hope fill me with faith
Darkness retreats at the touch of Your hand
Jesus savior help me to stand
Jesus lived through darkest pain
Rejected by men despising the shame
Man of sorrows acquainted with grief
He gave His life so we may be free
Jesus savior help me each day
Fill me with hope fill me with faith
Darkness retreats at the touch of Your hand
Jesus savior help me to stand
I know that Jesus died for me
Canceled my debt at Calvary
Rose from the dead unlocked Heaven's door
Trust in His love and live evermore
Jesus savior help me each day
Fill me with hope fill me with faith
Darkness retreats at the touch of Your hand
Jesus savior help me to stand <start> They come off soundin' pretty pompous
Each time they open their mouth
You can't believe it when you hear it
What they let come rollin' out
Don't know why they're so superhateful
Ain't like they've got it so bad
If they'd do more singin' and less talkin'
I think we'd all be glad
Say goodbye to Natalie
Adios Martie and Emily
They think that they're too cool
The chicks no longer rule
All country fans agree
Now they're threatenin' to quit
Like we really give a yeah
They say they're goin' pop
Garth he tried and flopped
But we won't soon forget
Martie Emily and Natalie
Was it the lack of nominations
At this year's C.M.A.'s

That got them tradin' in their banjos
For a drum machine and DJ's
Next thing you know they'll be on Soul Train
Out on the road with Eminem
They'll put some blingbling in their videos
And we'll all make fun of them
Say goodbye to Natalie
Adios Martie and Emily
The only folks in line
Are holding picket signs
And burning Chicks CDs
Wasn't it a sight to see
Them posin' naked on a magazine
Now everybody knows
They're overexposed
If you know what I mean
Martie Emily and Natalie
So go load up your tour bus and pull on out
'Cause your careers may soon be done
You bunch of multiplatinum jackass millionaires
Yeah yeah rock 'n' roll here they come
Say goodbye to Natalie
Adios Martie and Emily
We hate to see it in
Why can't we be friends
Please don't be mad at me
Martie Emily and Natalie
See ya later Natalie
You are the weakest link goodbye <start> I bought a ring and gave it to your daughter Mrs Jones
She promised me that she would be my wife
But after she had talked to you she gave me back my ring
Mrs Jones your daughter cried all night
Mrs Jones your daughter cried all night you wouldn't give your blessings to our love
You said she should stop seeing me and maybe you are right
But Mrs Jones your daughter cried all night
Mrs Jones some day some man may bring your daughter wealth
And all the things that I could never buy
But Mrs Jones we love each other and wealth won't buy a love
And I guess that's why your daughter cried all night
Oh how I wish that I could be the man
Who has the wealth to win your daughter's hand
You know her life is in your hands and you hold on so tight
Mrs Jones your daughter cried all night
Mrs Jones your daughter <start> You're late again tonight and I know the reason why
You're out with someone else while I sit home and cry
But I'll just wait right here for you cause I know your new love won't last
I wound easy but I heal fast
This isn't the first time your heart has gone a'stray
You have no resistance when temptation comes your way
But I'll forgive you this time like I've always done in the past
I wound easy but I heal fast
You know that I love you more than anything
And you know that I'll forgive you for causing me this pain
Oh tonight my heart is breaking but I know this hurt won't last
I wound easy but I heal fast
Yes tonight my heart is breaking but I know this hurt won't last
I wound easy but I heal fast <start> Sky on a break break down ghost town shake down beach
Good vibes blowin' in that gulf shore breeze
Saltwater skinny dip waitin' on me
It's hotter in the water good Lord
Ain't no doubt 'bout to lay you down on a beach towel
California king style
Gonna do it all night baby
Big stars shinin' over summerland
Sunburnt love with a a southern man
Baby right now I'm high as a kite
Seabirds fly yeah I just might tonight
Gypsy driftwood shiner bock kissin' on the dock
Big dipper slow dance
With my hands where the sun don't tan
Don't you worry 'bout the sand
In no time baby we'll be slippin' off to summerland
Lay it on back back to the back of that ragtop Jeep
Blame it on the waves we ain't geting no sleep
Fireside crackle kiss plant it on my cheek
Lips on a bottle
I know you ain't a model but you should be a model
I'm gonna kiss you to till tomorrow
And I'm gonna do it all night baby
Big stars shinin' over summerland
Sunburnt love with a a southern man
Baby right now I'm high as a kite
Seabirds fly yeah I just might tonight
Gypsy driftwood shiner bock kissing on the dock
Big dipper slow dance
With my hands where the sun don't tan
Don't you worry 'bout the sand
In no time baby we'll be slippin' off to summerland
Ain't no doubt 'bout to lay you down on a beach towel
California king style
Gonna do it all night baby
Big stars shinin' over summerland
Sunburn love with a a southern man
Baby right now I'm high as a kite
Seabirds fly yeah I just might tonight
Gypsy driftwood shiner bock kissin' on the dock
Big dipper slow dance

Don't you worry 'bout the sand
In no time baby we'll be slippin' off to summerland
The sky on a break break down ghost town shake down beach
Good vibes blowin' in that gulf shore breeze <start> I met a man
Traveling down the road
He looked me in the eye
And he gave me a ring
And he gave me a rose
And he told me some gypsy lies
The road is a lover you never recover
Not now or any time soon
My head starts to spin
When I think where I've been
Playin' twin to an old fiddle tune oh
As the wind chases after the moon
Through the kindness
Shown me that day
I gave him this melody
And we sang in duet
'Neath the stars in the sky
And the shadows of dancing trees
The road is a lover you never recover
Not now or any time soon
My head starts to spin
When I think where I've been
Playin' twin to an old fiddle tune oh
As the wind chases after the moon <start> By David Allan Coe
Every night another woman
Every day a different town
If I'm not accused of speeding
I'm accused of coming down
With a legal dose of something
That you heard was going 'round
And you wondered why I lost my sense of humor
Every song another record
Every day just like a clock
Knowing well I've had to take it
Till I make it to the top
With the devil right behind me
And my heart about to stop
Then you wondered why I lost my sense of humor
Twenty years I was in prison
More than that I was alone
Some lilywhite reporter
Thinks it's time that I was stoned
Without sin he wrote the story
And it chilled me to the bone
Then he wondered why I lost my sense of humor
I shaved my beard and cut my hair off
It don't matter anyhow
It was truth that told the answers
To the questions up till now
Crucify him someone shouted
From the safety of the crowd
Then they wondered why I lost my sense of humor
Hey take them crosses from my doorstep
There's no reason to my rhyme
Everybody knows somebody
Will take care of me in time
I made friends of all you stand for
But the blind can't lead the blind
Just be glad I haven't lost my sense of humor
Just be glad I haven't lost my sense of humor
'Cause if I ever catch you I'm gonna kick your ass <start> There was a little ship and she sailed upon the sea
And she went by the name of the Merry Golden Tree
And she sailed upon the low and lonesome low
And she sailed upon the lonesome sea
There was a little sailor unto his captain said
Oh captain captain what'll you give to me
If I sink them in the low and lonesome low
If I sink them in the lonesome sea
Two hundred dollars I will give unto thee
And my oldest daughter I'll wed unto you
If you sink them in the low and lonesome low
If you sink them in the lonesome sea
He bowed upon his breast and away swim he
Till he came the ship of the Turkish Reveille
As she sailed upon the low and lonesome low
As she sailed upon the lonesome sea
If it wasn't for the love of your daughter and your men
I would do unto you as I did unto them
I would sink you in the low and lonesome low
I would sink you in the lonesome sea
He bowed his head and down sank he
Farewell farewell to the Merry Golden Tree
For I'm sinking in the low and lonesome low
For I'm sinking in the lonesome sea <start> Boots spurs and a pearl handle cap pistol and a gold mine that dug in the sand
I rode the fence line in her backyard each day on a stick horse I called old Dan
One day my mama she called me aside and said you can't be fourteen again
There's not enough gold in your lost canyon mine to keep you from being a man
You're a little too old to play cowboy well its high time you made a change
So kick off your boots and bed down your horse
Cause there ain't no home on the range
A wife a son and a job at the factory but that never was really me
So we loaded up our old pickup truck to go where I wanted to be
A rodeo clown picked me up off the ground at the Cheyenne Frontier rodeo
That was the start of breakin' her heart she said you'd think a grown man would know
You're a little too old...
Bologna and beans were within our means and a hamburger once in a while
A new pair of jeans is the answer to dreams when you live in rodeo style
One day my boy said I don't want toys just a friend would satisfy me
And I knew right then I'd come to the end when the tears in his eyes said to me
You're a little too old... <start> 
Old photgraphs always make me laugh
Ponytails and golden locks
Dirty old boys from down the block
Always knew someday we'd have to go
Our separate ways
And you'll find someone to be
And I'd just go on being me
Chorus
Always searching always finding
We love too easily
We end up some man's family
Always believing the unbelievable
Forever leaving for another man's love
Old photographs always make me laugh
Racin' on our bicycles sun meltin' popsicles
Jumpin' on trampolineschildren have the neatest things
And July Fourth was never hot
The sun was just a great clock
Repeat Chorus
Old photographs always make me laugh
What happened to the dreams
What we thought were the simple things
It's been a long time now
And still it's funny how
Old photographs sometimes make me cry
Old photographs sometimes make me cry <start> Well I don't care if the sun don't shine I don't care if the bells don't chime
Just as long as you love me
And I don't care if the tops don't spin I don't care if the gins won't gin
Just as long as you love me
So darling let it rain let it snow let the cold north wind blow
Just as long as you love me
North or south east or west you know I will stand the test
Just as long as you love me
Guitar
Well I don't care if the birds don't sing I don't care if the bells don't ring
Just as long as you love me
I don't care if the world don't turn I don't care if the fire don't burn
Just as long as you love me
So darling let it rain...
Oh darling just as long as you love me <start> Just barely eighteen when the Great War was through
Ridin' and fighin' was all that I knew
Hard life and death was all that I seen
Ridin' hell bend for leather in search of a dream
I rode drag on a heard up the old Chisum trail
Straight through Oklahoma to Dodge City's jail
My hard dusty wages played out way too soon
On whisky and Keno at the Long Branch Saloon
All I have left is my stories to tell
Heavens too far and I'm plumb scared of hell
Nobody wants this pain and misery
But there still are some who think they could be a cowboy like me
I spent one lonely winter in an old line shack
With beans in my belly rain on my back
A ration of coffee and a mountain of snow
With cattle to attend to at forty below
And it's back for the round up in April or May
You round up the calf's boys and you cut out the strays
And you might touch a woman before the long summer ends
Then its back to the line shack and do it all again
And all I have left...
I've given some bad guys a hard way to go
I busted my bones in them old time rodeos
I might have stretched truth Lord but I've never lied
Can't you tell I'm a cowboy by the scars on my side
But I rode with Cole Younger and New Jesse James
Me and old Wyatt use to ride on the range
And men all said sir to my Colt 
And I was with Hitchcock the night that he died
All I have left... <start> Sometimes I'm battle weary
I forget to use my shield
The arrows pierce my armor
And I stumble in the filed
A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive
I'll think my life is over
But the Lord he comes to me
He heals my wounded spirit
And he sets me on my feet
A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive
Sometimes your battle weary
But the war's already won
Keep your head and hold your shield high
'Til your days of life are done
A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive <start> I heard every word you said
And trying hard to understand
Exactly what it is you need from me
Baby I apologize
I never meant to make you cry
But there ain't no doubt we can work it out yeah
Cause I'm gonna be around
Chorus
Don't worry baby
I ain't no maybe
Rain or Shine
This Love of mine is for you
Let my arms remind you
I'll always be beside you
Holdin' on until this ride is through
So away we go down that forever road
Baby as our lives unfold
There's no telling where we'll go
But as far as I can see it'll be you and me
Just the way it's supposed to be
Chorus
It ain't gonna be easy
We'll both make big mistakes
But if you love me trust me
We've got what it takes
Now
Chorus
Down that forever road
Away we go <start> She was going to pieces when he walked in the door
She had to see him she can't wait no more
Tonight she'll be with him no matter the cost
As the band plays The Last Cheater's Waltz
And oooooooohh don't they play lonely
Oooooooohh don't they play sad
Oooooooohh three quarter only
See how he holds her
As the band plays The Last Cheater's Waltz
He tells her he loves her as the music plays on
He tells he loves her but someone's at home
The ball game's all over and she knows she's lost
As the band plays The Last Cheater's Waltz
And oooooooohh don't they play lonely
Oooooooohh don't they play sad
Oooooooohh three quarter only
See how he holds her
As the band plays The Last Cheater's Waltz <start> Blessed assurance Jesus is mine
O what a foretaste of glory divine
Heir of salvation purchase of God
Born of his Spirit washed in his blood.
Chorus
This is my story this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long.
Perfect submission perfect delight
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight
Angels descending bring from above
Echoes of mercy whispers of love.
Chorus <start> As you walk away
As we say goodbye
What I wouldn't give
For a tender lie
Say you'll never stop loving me
Just as if it were true
How much more damage now honestly
Could one tender lie do
When we fall so far
Are we wrong to try
To keep out the truth
With a tender lie
Say you're gonna come back to me
And I'll believe that it's true
How much more damage now honestly
Could one tender lie do
Say you're gonna come back to me
And I'll believe that it's true
How much more damage now honestly
Could one tender lie do
How much more damage now honestly
Could one tender lie do <start> Walk round town spending my money thinking about you
Wondering why because you were my honey what did I do
I'm tired yes I'm tired why Lord goodbye
I've tried yes I've tried why Lord goodbye
You made my life oh so much better being with you
Cause since you've been gone I don't know whether I'll make it through
Because I'm tired yes I'm tired why Lord goodbye
I've tried yes I've tried why Lord goodbye <start> Elsie Brown has a suitcase
She carries in a cart round town
Filled with books former newsdays
The pages we've all thrown out
Her hands are gnarled
Clothes are tattered
As she whispers her words to the air
But don't you think she doesn't matter
Because you've never seen the poetry there
And Elsie Brown talks to street lights
Sees them shining in the bright of day
And she smiles for the children
Sees them shining as they walk away
Her hands are gnarled
Clothes are tattered
As she whispers her words to the air
But don't you think she doesn't matter
Because you've never seen the poetry there
In Elsie Brown
And Elsie Brown has a daughter
She hasn't seen in fifteen years
I found this out in a letter
On the ground the day she disappeared
Her hands were gnarled
Clothes were tattered
As she whispered her words to the air
But don't you think she didn't matter
Because you've never seen the poetry there
In Elsie Brown <start> Everybody's scared of something
Everybody knows
Life's not like the movies
Rescue credits roll
Ironman is probably busy
Spiderman's got webs to weave
They might not be around today for me
So what to do
When they all fall through
I am not wonder woman
Invincible or made of steel
I'm not extraordinary
I got dreams and I am real
Face my fears I lose my sorrow
Stronger than I thought I could
Be that better me tomorrow
Be my own superhero
Superhero
I used to be afraid to speak
To say what I believed
I was my own kryptonite
My own worst enemy
And then somehow I found the power locked inside of me
I finally figured out who I could be
I knew what to do
Who to stand up to
I am not wonder woman
Invincible or made of steel
I'm not extraordinary
I got dreams and I am real
Face my fears I lose my sorrow
Stronger than I thought I could
Be that better me tomorrow
Be my own superhero
It's changing tyres
It's running miles
It's the inner pride when you surprise yourself
Never being content
Paying the rent
The risky step when there's no one there to catch you
If you fall
I am not wonder woman
Invincible or made of steel
I'm not extraordinary
I got dreams and I am real
Face my fears I lose my sorrow
Stronger than I thought I could
Be that better me tomorrow
Be my own superhero
Superhero
Superhero
Superhero <start> two smiling faces
thats how it use to be <start> It's a lesson too late for the learning
Made of sand made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turnin'
In your hand in your hand
Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh i could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
As we walk along my thoughts are tumblin'
Round and round round and round
Underneath our feet are someplace rumblin'
Underground underground
Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh i could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
I've got reason a plenty for goin
This i know this i know
The weeds have been steadily growin'
Please don't go please don't go
Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
I could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh i could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
You know that was the last thing on my mind <start> Sweet dreams of you every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
You don't love me it's plain
I should know I'll never wear my ring
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
Sweet dreams of you things I know can't come true
Why can't I forget the past start loving someone new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
Instead of having sweet dreams about you <start> My father had so much to tell me things he said I had to know
Don't make my mistakes there are rules you can't break
But I had to find out on my own
Now when I look at my own sons I see what my father went through
There's only so much you can do
You're proud when they walk scared when they run
That's how it always has been between fathers and sons
It's a bridge you can't cross it's a cross you can't bear
It's the words you can't say the things you can't change
No matter how much you care
So you do all you can then you gotta let go
You're just part of the flow of the river that runs between fathers and sons
Now your mother she'll try to protect you she'll hold you as long as she can
But the higher you climb the more you can see
And that's something I understand
One day you'll look at your own son there'll be so much that you want to say
But he'll have to find his own way
Down the road he must take the course he must run
That's how it always has been between fathers and sons
It's a bridge you can't cross
We're just part of the flow of the river that runs between fathers and sons <start> we have seen the star
and have come to worship him
we have seen the star
and have come to worship him <start> If you'd have only taken the time to tell me you're mine and say that you love me
I may not have been too eager then to tell you goodbye
But I made up my mind for sure this time that I'm gonna leave you
So next time don't wait don't hesitate appreciate the good man
I don't belong so I'll just move along it's better this way
A man should walk tall but you made me feel small and that's why I say
If you'd have only taken the time...
But I made up my mind...
But I made up my mind... <start> Open up your eyes
Cause there's a shadow outside
Open up your eyes
Cause there's something outside
Wake up the drowsy friends
You've made along your way
Because there's shadows
On the horizon my friend
There's shadows on the horizon
Take this amulet
Take this and go
And be on your way
That's all i got to say
You're lucky you've come this far at all
You're near the end of your days
Because there's shadows
On the horizon my friend
There's shadows on the horizon <start> The whole world is wrong today
But you've been gone so long
That I lost count of days
When you come home
I'm gonna tell you how I got along
I'm gonna tell you gonna tell you
Everything I thought
Emptiness was bought with your plane ticket
Not so much as a kiss goodbye
I don't want to think of the reasons why
I don't wanna think of reasons why
Most things I wanna say
They will go unspoken always
But if you look a little closer in my eye
You will know everything there is to know
You're gonna know you're gonna know
Everything I thought
Overcome the sloth got me a ride to New York
And not so much as a reason why
I just want a kiss a kiss goodbye
I just want a kiss a kiss goodbye
The whole world is wrong today
But you've been gone so long that I lost count of days
But when you come home
I'm gonna tell you how I got along
I'm gonna tell you gonna tell you
Everything I thought
Emptiness was bought with your plane ticket
And not so much as a reason why
I just want a kiss a kiss goodbye
I just want a kiss goodbye <start> I cry myself to sleep each night
Wishing I could hold you tight
Life seems so empty since you went away
And the pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my empty dreams instead
And it keeps right on ahurtin'
Since you're gone
It keeps right on a'hurtin every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on ahurtin' since you're gone
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
But when I see you passing by
My heart breaks down and cries a million tears
The pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my empty dreams instead
And it keeps right on ahurtin' since you're gone
It keeps right on a'hurtin every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on ahurtin' since you're gone
Yes it keeps right on ahurtin' since you're gone <start> This tie's fitting just a little too tight
Might have had one too many last night
I wonder if it's written all over my face
It's been a little while since I've seen this place
Still I'm sitting here in the back row
Like a long lost son is come back home
When I bow my head and taken off my hat
A Sunday morning takes me back
Growing up under that hometown church steeple
Learning God hates sin but still loves people
The preacher preaching 'bout the Promised Land
And me thinking 'bout holding Jesse Lane's hand
And one hot summer when I was thirteen
Took my soul to the river and washed it clean
Feels so good Lord why can't there be
Seven Sundays a week
Well I can still hear daddy singing strong and low
It is well it is well with my soul
And mama laid up the Sunday best
I can still count every flower on her blue sun dress
I've done a lot of living since those days
But a boy comes back when he's been raised
Growing up under that hometown church steeple
Learning God hates sin but still loves people
The preacher preaching 'bout the Promised Land
And me thinking 'bout holding Jesse Lane's hand
And one hot summer when I was thirteen
Took my soul to the river and washed it clean
Feels so good Lord why can't there be
Seven Sundays a week
It was soft ball games
And it was true love waits
And all of those amazing things
About amazing grace
Growing up under that hometown church steeple
Learning God hates sin but still loves people
The preacher preaching 'bout the Promised Land
And me thinking 'bout holding Jesse Lane's hand
And one hot summer when I was thirteen
Took my soul to the river and washed it clean
It feels so good Lord why can't there be
Seven Sundays a week
Seven Sundays a week <start> Looking out my window
See you playing in the leaves
It's amazing how a little girl
Means all the world to me
When I tell you that I love you
I love you more than words can say
Smile say cheese pretty please
I want to take your picture
How'd you ever get so big
I gotta take your picture
And hold on to the mem'ry before
The whole things slips away
I wish I could save these moments
And put 'em in a jar
I wish I could stop
The world from turning
Keep things just the way they are
I wish I could shelter you from
Everything not pure and sweet and good
I know I can't I know I can't
But I wish I could
When you kiss me for no reason
It goes straight to my heart
When I feel your arms around me
I almost fall apart
It's time for bed
You whisper daddy we forgot to pray
I wish I could save these moments
When I watch you sleeping
All my worries slip away
A little bit of heaven
Close on your gentle face
I wish I could save these moments <start> I've been down with a broken heart
Since the day I learned to speak
The devil gave me a crooked start
When he gave me crooked feet
But Gabriel don came to me
And kissed me in my sleep
And I'll be singing like an angel
Until I'm six feet deep
I found myself an omen and I tattooed on a sign
I set my mind a wandering and I walk a broken line
You have a mind to keep me quiet
And although you can try
Better men have hit their knees
And bigger men have died
I'm gonna raise raise hell
There's a story no one tells
You gotta raise raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
You came upon a lightning strike
And eyes of bright clear blue
I took that tie from around my neck
And gave my heart to you
I sent my love across the sea
And though I didn't cry
That voice will haunt my every dream
Until the day I die
I'm gonna raise raise hell
There's a story no one tells
You gotta raise raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
I dug a hole inside my heart
To put you in your grave
At this point it was you and me
And mama didn't raise no slave
You took my face in both your hands
And looked me in the eye
And I went down with such a force
That in your grave I lie
I'm gonna raise raise hell
There's a story no one's telling
You gotta raise raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell <start> I'd be lyin' if I said I never prayed for this
I can show you here and now how much love you've missed
I'm happy that you're sad I know that sounds so wrong
But darlin' you must know the pains gone on too long
Come in out of the pain let me dry your tears
Well he's been gone for days and I've loved you for years
Lay down in my arms there ain't no shame
Now don't just stand there girl come in out of the pain
Well I know how a heartache feels shattered when it breaks
And if you believe in me he'll be your last mistake
I can't stop the wind and I can't stop the rain
But I can promise you that I can stop your pain
Come in out of the pain and let me dry your tears
Well he's been gone for days and I've loved you for years
Oh lay down in my arms there ain't no shame
But don't just stand there girl come in out of the pain <start> I'm just waitin' for the time to come when all sorrow will be done
Then I'm be goin' home to heaven above
Then I'll shout and sing with the angels up there
Tell the Saviour of His love and care
That He had for me in this world below
So happy I'll be when my Saviour I shall see
And tell Him of His love that He had for me
No more sorrows grief or pain all the time will be the same
So happy I'll be forever more
Some happy time just wait and see my blessed Saviour will come for me
Then I'm goin' home to heaven above
Where my loved ones have gone before to that bright and shining shore
So happy I'll be forever more
So happy I'll be
So happy I'll be when my Saviour I shall see
And tell Him of His love that He had for me
No more sorrows grief or pain all the time will be the same
So happy I'll be forever more
Oh just think of the day my friends when the saints go marching in
Then I'm goin' home to heaven above
Oh so happy I'll be my blessed Saviour I shall see
So happy I'll be forever more
So happy I'll be
So happy I'll be when my Saviour I shall see
And tell Him of His love that He had for me
No more sorrows grief or pain all the time will be the same
So happy I'll be forever more <start> He's got a way of walkin'
He's got a way of talkin'
A way to fascinate me all the time
And he's got a way with women
A way to keep my head a swimmin'
He's got away too many times
Chorus
Ooh speakin' of the devil
Well here he comes now
Lookin' like an angel
Got my defenses down
He's got me dreamin'
Got me schemin'
Ooh speakin' of the devil
He is drivin' me wild
With that wicked little grin
And that fire in his eyes
He's got me dreamin'
Got me steamin'
Ooh speakin' of the devil
It feels mighty close to heaven
And I'd go through hell to make him mine
He's got his spell upon me
Got to be his one and only
Burning with passion and desire
Ooh I'm caught up in all his magic
It surely would be tragic
To never share the heat
From all this fire
Repeat chorus twice <start> Six o'clock on Friday evening
Momma doesn' t know she's leaving
'Til she hears the screen door slamming
Rubber squealin' gears ajamming
Local country station just a blaring on the radio
Pick him up at seven and they're headin' to the rodeo
Momma's on the front porch screamin' out her warning
Girl you better get your red head
Back in bed before the morning
Nine o'clock the show is ending
But the fun is just beginning
She knows he's anticipating
But she's gonna keep him waiting
Grab a bite to eat
And then they're heading to the honkey tonk
But loud crowds and line dancing
Just ain't what they really want
Drive out to the boondocks and park down by the creek
And where it's George Strait 'til real late
And dancing cheek to cheek
Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Going 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
Ten 'til twelve is wine and dancing
Midnight starts the hard romancing
One o'clock that truck is rocking
Two is coming still no stopping
Break to check the clock at three
They're right on where they want to be
Four o'clock get up and going
Five o'clock that rooster's crowing
Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Going 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
Six o'clock on Saturday
Her folks don't know he's on his way
The stalls are clean the horses fed
They say she's grounded 'til she's dead
Well here he comes around the bend
Slowing down she's jumping in
Hey mom you're daughter's gone
And there they go again
Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Going 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up <start> 
Once upon a Christmas far away in Bethlehem
Mary being great with child had no place to lie down
So Joseph found a stable in which Mary had her child
Once upon a Christmas was the birth of Jesus Christ
Once upon a Christmas in a manger far away
A King was born His palace was a manger filled with hay
His royal robe was swaddling cloth a halo was His crown
Once upon a Christmas away in Bethlehem
And all the world rejoiced because the King was born at last
A savior had been promised now it had come to pass
And the joyful news that He was born spread quickly far and wide
Once upon a Christmas was the birth of Jesus Christ
Once upon a Christmas from the Far East wise men came
With gold and myrrh and frankincense to praise the newborn King
And shepherds left their flocks and came to see and worship Him
Once upon a Christmas away in Bethlehem
And all the world rejoiced because the King was born at last
A savior had been promised now it had come to pass
And the joyful news that He was born spread quickly far and wide
Once upon a Christmas was the birth of Jesus Christ
Once upon a Christmas far away in Bethlehem <start> She said goodbye in Tallahassee
I just crawled in my truck
Set my mind on Miami
And my sights on better luck
Chorus
Ain't a man deserves to hurt like this
It's a lonely place it sure is
Guess I never really knew the blues
Ever got this far from Memphis
All the night life and the beaches
Couldn't soothe my achin' soul
And how I ended up in Key West
God and the liquor only know
Chorus
Now I've run out of road
So I guess my only hope
Is to trade this truck for a boat
Chorus
Ever got this far from Memphis
Man I'm a long ways from Memphis <start> Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do
Bicycles are made for rain
One hand on handlebars
One on my umbrella
My ankles are getting wet
But I can't help but steer
For the deepest puddle
Let the rain fall
Soak us to the bone
Nothing will sink our smiles
Double dutch was made for sunny days
When we've been driving such long hours
Our legs get restless so we need to jump and run
and laugh with one another
And if there is no sun
When we're far from home
Nothing will sink our smiles
Let the rain fall
Soak us to the bone
Nothing will sink our smiles
Life can be uncertain at the best of times
Try to move quicker by the worst of times
All things are made better when you have some friends
to get by with a little help
Bathing suits are made for sandy beaches
Where the waters warm in the afternoon
I can do no dolphin kick but I can spin in circles
Float till the rise of the moon
Let the waves roll
Wash us to the shore
Nothing can sink our smiles
And if there is no sun
When we're far from home
Nothing will sink our smiles
Let the rain fall
Soak us to the bone
Nothing will sink our smiles
Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Ba ba ba ba ba
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh <start> How could he take you in his arms and help you to be free
Then leave you forgotten and is it enough to cry
When you're so broken
Her cold eyes tell you you're not welcome she tells lies
But you'll take her back again and is it enough to die
When you're so taken
You will be loved again
You will be loved again
But will she sing and will she dance
And will she forever and will he sing
And will he dance and will he forever
Someday you will feel a love so deep
And you'll find someone not lost in sleep
And you will be loved again you will be loved again you will be loved again <start> It's so nice to meet an old friend and pass the time of day
And talk about the hometown a million miles away
Is the ice still in the river are the old folks still the same
And by the way did she mention my name
And by the way did she mention my name just in passing
And when the morning came do you remember if she dropped a name or two
Is the homesteam still on fire do they still win all their games
And by the way did she mention my name
 harmonica 
Is the landlord still a loser do his signs hang on the wall
Are the young girls still as pretty in the city in the fall
Does the laughter on their faces still put the sun to shame
And by the way did she mention my name
Did she mention my name just in passing
And when the talk ran high did the look in her eyes seem far away
Is the old roof still leaking when the lakes all turn to rain
And by the way did she mention my name
 harmonica 
Did she mention my name...
And by the way did she mention my name <start> Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you come back again
You came back but never meant to stay
Now I've got heartaches by the number troubles by the score
Every day you love me less each day I love you more
Yeah I've got heartaches by the number a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end
Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you was coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited but you must have lost your way
Now I've got heartaches by the number troubles by the score
Every day you love me less each day I love you more
Yeah I've got heartaches by the number a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end
Yeah the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end <start> Well if you love your mama and you treat her right
But she keeps on fussin' at you every day and night
And she's triflin' on ye they'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin' Lord you nearly lose your mind
Now if your mama's mean take a tip from me
Lock her up at home Lord and hang on to the key
'Cause she won't triflin' on ye they'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin' Lord you nearly lose your mind
But if your mama's good I'll tell you what to do
Give her lots of lovin' and what she wants to do
She'll trifle on ye they'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin' Lord you nearly lose your mind
Now you come home to your mama find your clothes ain't clean
You can bet you're slippin' if you know just what I mean
'Cause she's been triflin' on ye they'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin' Lord you nearly lose your mind
Now you may have a mama who says that she is true
But wait till you get down and out and really leave her too
She'll trifle on ye they'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin' Lord you nearly lose your mind
Now I've been lotta places not much I ain't done
But when it comes to women I just don't trust a one
Because they'll trifle on ye they'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin' Lord you nearly lose your mind
 <start> You know I'm really gonna miss you sugar britches
I'm gonna miss you too Bub
Now I'm only gonna be gone a few days
But now there is a few things I need you to do while I'm gone
Oh I figured there's somethin'
Oh quit complainin'
All you gotta do is cut the grass wash the car trim the hedges
Paint the fence clean the pool give the dog a bath
Defrost the fridge clean out the garage
Right
Sweep the chimney and I'll see you on Monday
I love you boogie boogie
I love you too an' you you don't you worry 'bout me I'll be just fine
I've got my socks dryin' in the microwave
Hair on my back I don't plan to shave
I've got the house to myself while the wife's away
I'll be rockin' all night
Yeah I think I'll drink me an ice cold brew
Lounge in my boxers like I used to do
There'll be no Ally McBeal on the tube no
I'll be watchin' the fight
Well it's a great day to be a guy
Played cards with my buddies until sunrise
You know I never thought that my neighbor would
Be sunbathing topless Lord she sure looks good
I caught a  pound bass out on the lake
Played  holes with my best friend Jake
Best balls I hit was when I stepped on a rake
Oh well it wasn't too bright
Now I look in the fridge what do I see
Last night's pizza starin' back at me
Pepperoni and anchovies
What a beautiful sight
Well it's a great day to be a guy
Buck naked in my lawn chair swattin' at flies
Got some hot dogs on the charcoal grill
I don't wanna burn my wieners but I probably will
That fried baloney and cheese macaroni
Tasted good this afternoon
But now I'm passin' some serious gas and
I might have to leave the room
Pee hee
Well I might go get me a new hairdo
Spend a couple hours in a tanning booth
Might even get me a gold front tooth
Whoa hah yeah
And it's a great day to be a guy
But when my wife gets home she's gonna tan my hide
I'll be hung over but a lookin' good
From a week of reliving my bachelorhood
It's a great day to be a guy
But another week of this and I'd probably die
I tend to party harder than I should
When my wife's not here to make me be good
Yeah hoo <start> Baby it's strange how things go down
How every circle comes around
Nobody wins everyone pays
You and I standing here again
Thinkin' about what might have been
Ready to go our separate ways
Chorus
One more night
We could have been in love
Just one more night
We should have been in love
I guess we asked more than we ever gave
But I would give the world
Baby if I could save
What we have for one more night
Funny I just can't get it clear
Where are we gonna go from here
You without me me without you
Somehow I pray the days won't end
'Cause when the darkness comes again
I don't believe I'll make it through
Chorus
If we could make it right
If I could turn back time for you and me
Baby it wouldn't have to be
Chorus <start> Darlin' you're tired
I can see in your eyes
I know how you feel
We've been together
Too long to conceal
What's in our hearts
Maybe we should part
But after so many years
That would only bring loneliness
Sorrow and tears
And anyway...
I never would
Never could
Never will ever kill what's between us
So let's try again
We'll start a brand new dance
Between old friends
There will always be days
When it don't seem to pay
When it just doesn't rhyme
Well that's bound to happen
Some of the time
Our best days aren't gone
We don't need to move on
Well maybe we should try
But I don't think you could take it
And neither could I
And anyway...
I never would
Never could
Never will ever kill what's between us
So let's try again
We'll start a brand new dance
Between old friends
Darlin' come here
Love's not disappeared
You're just feelin' low
Well let me tell you my darlin'
That's a feelin' I know
It don't mean too much
We just got out of touch
Well it's easy to change
'Cause lovin' you's not too hard to arrange
And anyway...
I never would
Never could
Never will ever kill what's between us
So let's try again
We'll start a brand new dance
Between old friends
We'll start a brand new dance
Between old friends
Yes we'll start a brand new dance
Between old friends <start> I remember the summer I turned sixteen
And that old jalopy Daddy gave to me
It had holes in the floor and just a 
But I didn't care 'cause I could finally drive.
There wasn't much to do in my home town
So every weekend night we would all go down
There were freaks and hippies in my high school
Football players all tryin' to be cool.
And everybody scramblin' to hide their beer'
When the cops drove by till the coast was clear.
Kids fallin' in and out of love
On the hoods of Chevys in the beds of trucks
We were stumblin' our way through life 'til our senior year
But man we sure did learn a lot in that WalMart parking lot.
She had long blonde hair and seagreen eyes
The most beautiful thing I'd ever seen in my life.
But I was young and dumb and didn't have a line
And all I could say was can i call 'ya sometime
She just said no and walked away
But she just said no and walked away
And that was the first time I felt my heart break.
There were freaks and hippies in my high school
Football players all tryin' to be cool.
And everybody scramblin' to hide their beer'
When the cops drove by till the coast was clear.
Yeah we all did alot of livin'.
It was smalltown teenage heaven.
There were freaks and hippies in my high school
Football players all tryin' to be cool.
And everybody scramblin' to hide their beer'
When the cops drove by till the coast was clear.
Well I had my first kiss my first love
Got my ass kicked but I got back up.
Lost my way found it again
Had one long buzz and a dozen best friends
In that WalMart parking lot.
In that WalMart parking lot. <start> We said our goodbyes long ago
Never thinking we'd miss each other so
All the memories we can't leave behind
Oh we must have been out of our minds
I thought I loved another not you
Ain't it foolish I thought the same too
They both turned out to be the wrong kinds
Oh we must have been out of our minds
Let's forgive and forget the past we've known
And reap together the wild seeds we've sowed
Surely they can forgive us and find
That we must have been out of our minds
I thought I loved another not you...
Yes we must have been out of our minds <start> She was leaning on a rail in a cotton dress
Summer tanned pretty little perfect mess
With a story that could only be anybody's guess
And I was thinking that I probably didn't stand a chance
But I rolled up my sleeves walked up and I said
Hey I don't know you but I'd kinda like a shot
She said I saw you comin' over I already thought it over
And OK so now what
And I said well I got a car she said there's something
At least it's a start I said it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said where do you think all this is going
I said there ain't no way of knowing
I guess I hadn't thought it through that far
But I got a car
So we let the wheels turn and the windows down
We let ourselves go all the way through town
She never said stop and I never asked her why
We drove into the night when outta nowhere
She said I'd give anything to never go back there
And I kinda wish this day would never end
She said I could use a change but I don't even know where
And I said well I got a car she said there's something
At least it's a start I said it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said where do you think all this is going
I said there ain't no way of knowing
I really hadn't thought it through that far
And I can't promise you the moon and stars
But I got a car
We got lost in the miles lost track of the days
'Til we finally found a stopping place
When the doctor's said you know what's on the way
And we found ourselves in a little white house
One Sunday morning rain pouring down
She said I think it's time but all the lines are out
And her eyes teared up and she said what are we gonna do now
And I said well I got a car she said there's something
You think it'll start I said it's already running
Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are
She said are you sure it'll get us where we're goin'
I said if there's one thing I know girl it's gotten us this far
And I don't mean to hurry but I'm ready when you are <start> Pour me another Tequila Sheila
Take off that red satin dress
I cross the border and I beat the dealer
For all the damn gold in Juarez.
I feel like old Pancho Villa Sheila
And sure could use a friend 
So pour me another Tequilla Sheila
And lay down n'love me again.
Though I can tell you about it
But don't mind my gun by the bed
I feel kind of naked without it
And it eases the fear in my head.
Just pass me the salt n'the lemon
Bend down n'blow out the light
I never had trusted the woman
But Sheila I'll trust you tonight.
Pour me another Tequila Sheila
Take off that red satin dress
I cross the border and I beat the dealer
For all the damn gold in Juarez.
I feel like old Pancho Villa Sheila
And sure could use a friend 
So pour me another Tequilla Sheila
And lay down n'love me again
Sheila I'm hearing your heart beat
But I'm hearing footsteps outside
The courtyard is crawling with damn federalists
And Sheila there's no place to hide.
I don't know who could have tipped them
nobody knew but you
But I can't make love to a squealer Sheila
So I guess there's just one thing to do.
Pour me another Tequila Sheila.
I'm gonna put on your red dress you put on my cloths
You go out and face the dealer
And Sheila I wish you the best.
I feel like old Pancho Villa Sheila
I need a fast horse and a friend
So pour me another Tequila Sheila
And I'll ride towards the border again <start> Well its good to see you folks tonight I hope you got your hats on tight
And I hope you're ready to hear some cowboy songs
You can listen up or party down have a cup or stick around
There ain't no blues gonna hang around here too long
Cause tonight we came to have a down home good time
Gonna do some songs about this western land
We might even pick until the morning sunshine
We the wild and wooly saddle boogie band
If your tired of love sick blues cheating songs that were born to lose
Well boy I'll tell you you came to the right place
We're gonna do some western soul a little cowboy rock and roll
Guarantee to put a smile right on your face
Cause tonight we came... <start> If you see me
You don't have to say hello
The way you never said goodbye
So long ago
If you wonder
How I am just fine
Alone right where you left me
Off your mind
When I heard the news
About your life
I never doubted you
Became his wife
But I can safely tell you
I'm okay
Right here where I've stayed
Out of your way
Sometimes I wonder
How I do
This without you
Then sometimes I wonder
If you wonder too
Could that be true
If you wonder
How I am just fine
Alone right where you left me
Off your mind
If you have dreams
About someone like me
Just take those pills of yours
And try to get some sleep
You'll never have to hear
My voice no more
It stopped making sound
When you walked out the door <start> You know I'm working overtime
Just trying to cover my behind
You know you took all my money
And I guess you thought you took my mind
You can run you can't hide
And just as sure as your breathing
I ain't gonna let it slide
When you're living in a glass house
Don't go to bed with the lights on
Well I was raised by the rule
That forgiving is the way divine
Took everything I had for giving
Then you left what was left behind
Go on and run you can't hide
And sure as you're breathing
I ain't gonna let it slide
I got acquainted with your cleaners
And they really did all right by you
I've got my own window cleaners comin'
Now let's see just what you do
Day or night It's alright What you do
When you wake up by the dawn's early light
Come on <start> Cledus at the kitchen table
Short of breath legally disabled
Wife walks in she's so surprised
Can't believe I'm still alive
I say I'm hungry for biscuits and gravy
That patty melt that you always made me
But I can't eat that anymore
They say grease kills tastes good to me
Day in day out it's all I eat
My third bypass unclogged the valves
Just to clog them again
Never felt worse a constant thirst
Lordy how my left arm hurts
I blame my job I blame my wife
For this coronary life
Cledus on the ER table
Vital signs ain't too stable
Hey Doc I'm proud of you
I didn't think that I'd pull through
Later in Intensive Care
I had the nurses laughing there
So thankful Blue Cross will pay
For the bills my IVs
Four thousand dollar EKGs
That's the last time I need
Angioplasty
It's off I go to TyeBo
To improve my cardio
It's about time I said goodbye
To my coronary life
Sweat's pouring off me at the health spa
The Stairmaster's wore me out again
You know I can't believe how much I miss
The way I used to live
I'd eat red meat pickled pigs' feet
Always craving something sweet
My food was fast but that's the past
I can't eat fat again
Aerobicize reduced my thighs
No more German chocolate pie
I miss my fudge I miss my fries
And my coronary life <start> I wish that I could find the way to make my yesterdays
Pack up and find themselves another home
I don't like to live with everything that's gone
When my lovin' lost its flavor and you wanted sweeter wine
How come you let your mem'ries here behind
They're with me from the dawn until the sundown on my mind
You're with me when the robin sings an early morning song
You're with me in the sunshine all day long
Your mem'ry's always with me when the Sandman knocks upon my door
And whispers it's a dreamin' time
You're with me from the dawn until the sundown on my mind
 harmonica 
I've heard them say a heartache's nothin' more than just a mem'ry
They say the hurt will leave when I'll forget
But I can't stop remembering you yet
If broken hearts were able to turn back the hands of time
I think I'd be the first to stand in line
You're with me from the dawn until the sundown on my mind
You're with me when the robin sings...
You're with me from the dawn until the sundown on my mind <start> Do you think of the cross on which Jesus died
Of the blood he shed for you
Are you prepared to meet him in that land of love
By his word are you going to abide
Remember the cross on which Jesus died
Follow in his footsteps each day
He shed his blood for you and he shed his blood for me
Never cast that cross aside
Never let other people lead you astray
Teach his words to them if you can
They must think of the cross on which Jesus died
And get ready to meet him someday
Remember the cross on which Jesus died
Follow in his footsteps each day
He shed his blood for you and he shed his blood for me
Never cast that cross aside
When Jesus comes down from heaven above
And you haven't thought of that cross
He'll cast you aside in the twinkling of an eye
And you won't see his blessed home of love
Remember the cross on which Jesus died
Follow in his footsteps each day
He shed his blood for you and he shed his blood for me
Never cast that cross aside <start> Rivers turn to oceans and flow on to the sea embers turn to ashes and love to memories.
Rain turns to rainbows and gray skies turn to blue.
But when the world turns on me I turn to you.
A thirsty man needs water.
A bluebird needs the sky.
A man needs his woman or he'll wither up and die.
Roses need sunshine. Violets need the dew.
But not half as much as I need you.
Deep in my soul and always on my mind forever in my heart you're the light that shines.
Someone to hold when no one else will do.
When the world turns on me I turn to you.
When the world turns on my I turn to you. <start> I've got to tell you I've been rackin' my brain
Hopin' to find a way out
I've had enough of this continual rain
Changes are comin' no doubt

It's been a too long time
With no peace of mind
And I'm ready for the times
To get better
You seem to want from me what I cannot give
I feel so lonesome at times
I have a dream that I wish I could live
It's burnin' holes in my mind

Na na na...
 <start> It's feelin' longer now than it ever has before
Another memory is another slammin' door
It's gettin' too dark now to see
Every photograph is another lesson learned
Every sleepless night is another page I've turned
I wake up to fallin' dreams
And the petals start to fade by the picket fences
Just another shade of miles and miles to go
If I had a chance I must've missed it long ago
If I could run away I wouldn't have to let you go
This angel's bound to stray
Like an hourglass I'm a soul to sinkin' sand
You try to hold my heart and I will slip right through your hands
Time just blows away
And the petals start to fade by the picket fences
Just another shade of miles and miles to go
And the tears forever flow
And the petals start to fade by the picket fences
Just another shade of miles and miles to go
And this angel's bound to stray
It's another shade of miles and miles to go <start> 
Like the morning sun
His love moved across every inch of my body
And the heat from the fire burned me up with desire
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven for sure
This morning when I opened my eyes
There to my surprise
Lay that angel I thought had been only a dream
And so I said a little prayer
And thanked God that he was there
Oh this is a dream come true
Dream do come true
I know 'cause I found you
I never thought they did
But now I do
Dreams do come true
It was love at first sight
And it was love all night
And the way he made love to me
Fulfilled all my fantasies
Ooo this is a dream come true
Yes dreams do come true
I know 'cause I found you
I never thought they did
But you're living proof
That dreams do come true
Dreams do come true
And I am so in love with you <start> The mills of the Gods grind slowly away
And there's no escape till reckoning day
You think you've gone free and then suddenly
The mills of the Gods grind slowly away
 guitar 
Be happy and forget me my heart's cried out today
As you passed with another and looked the other way
You'll never change my darling go on and be untrue
But cheaters always suffer and I'm reminding you
The mills of the Gods grind slowly away... <start> She's in some honky tonk tonight I know
She's dancing where the music's loud and lights are low
In a crowed bar she likes to hang around
And as long as there's a honky tonk she'll never settle down
So close up the honky tonks lock all the doors
Don't let the one I love go there any more
Close up the honky tonks throw away the key
Then maybe the one I love will come back to me
I wish I had the power to turn back the time
And live again the hours when she was all mine
But it hurts to see her running with that crowd down
And as long as there's a honky tonk she'll never settle down <start> My past brought me to you your past brought you to me
Ours was a love people said just couldn't last
They said we'd have no future cause we had too much past
But we're still together and we will always be
My past brought me to you your past brought you to me
No matter what we've ever done whether it be wrong or right
It led us to each other's arms and to this place tonight
So be thankful for a past without it we could never be
My past brough me to you your past brought you to me
 guitar 
We were unhappy so we started slippin' around
We met each other and we like what we found
We found a true love that will last eternaly
My past brought me to you your past brought you to me
No matter what we've ever done... <start> I look out to the east of the Colorado sky
The canyons are throwin' dust in the storms eye
And the storms gettin' angry I know that its so
It's fixin' to blow away a little more of Colorado
It seems to be a twister as the clouds begin to cry
And there goes momma clothesline leavin' on the fly
Here come the rain drops ten thousand four
It's gonna wash away our little part of Colorado
The mules are gettin' restless its hard to keep them shy
Don't they know they've got to get us to the other side
The fence is fallin' down and the barns about to go
As I watch the storm take away my part of Colorado
Most of all we want our lives and that's a fact
And what little we're taking the wind wants it back
Run momma run and try to get the mules to go
And God help us get the hell away from Colorado
I look out to the east of the Colorado sky
The canyons are throwin' dust in the storms eye
And the storms gettin' angry I know that its so
It's fixin' to blow away a little more of Colorado
Colorado <start> At last I found the way to free myself from you
And all the heartaches that you left to make me blue
I thought my world had ended when you said goodbye
Till I found three ways to ease the pain cry cry cry
I cry when I get lonely and sometimes when I'm blue
I cry each time I think about the times I cried for you
I'm sure that I'll get over you as time goes by
Cause I found three ways to ease the pain cry cry cry
 steel 
Maybe someday all the cheers will wash the hurt away
And drown all of my sorrow I pray for that day
But until the day that all my tears are dried
I'll have three ways to ease the pain cry cry cry
I cry when I get lonely... <start> I ain't chasing no neon rainbows
I ain't gonna be killing time
I'm just sittin' around here wondering
How to get her off my mind
'Cause being without her ain't easy
And I can't seem to get away
'Cause the key to her heart she gave me
Somehow is making me stay
There won't be no devil in my pocket
I ain't cryin' over broken heart
But the key that she once gave me
It don't seem to fit her lock
'Cause being without her ain't easy
And I can't seem to get away
'Cause the key to my she gave me
Is somehow makin' me stay
 Oh Angelyna
Why'd you leave me all alone
 Oh Angelyna
I've been lonely since you've been gone
I ain't no city slicker
I've always been just a country boy
I didn't see the way she used me
I didn't know I want just a toy
The way she made me feel
I never felt like this before
Like a dream but you know you're sleeping
You wake to find she's out the door
 Oh Angelyna
Why'd you leave me all alone
 Oh Angelyna
I've been lonely since you since you been gone
 Oh Angelyna
Why'd you leave me all alone
 Oh Angelyna
Well I been lonely since you've been gone
 Oh Angelyna
Why'd you leave me all alone
 Oh Angelyna
Well I been lonely since you've been gone <start> You can't reach me anymore
You say I'm not the girl that you remember
You say that I hve changed so much and you can't seem to rach me
Well you destroyed everything I used to be before and you can't reach me anymore
I was looked up to you while you were looking down
It used to turn me off inside when you would turn me down
Now you want the love from me that you destroyed before
But you can't reach me anymore
Now you say you love me more than anything
I used to love you that way now I don't feel a thing
The love that once lived in my heart don't live there anymore
And you can't reach me anymore
I was looked up to you while you were looking down
It used to turn me off when you would turn me down
Love that once lived in my heart it don't live there anymore
And you can't reach me anymore oh oh oh no you can't reach me anymore <start> I left out in a cloud of taillights and dust
Swore I wasn't coming back said I'd had enough
Saw you in the rear view standing fading from my life
But I wasn't turnin' 'round
No not this time
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Don't think I don't wonder 'bout
Could've been should've been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it
When we make choices we gotta live with them
Heard you found a real good man and you married him
I wonder if sometimes I cross your mind
Where would we be today
If I never drove that car away
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Don't think I don't wonder 'bout
Could've been should've been all worked out
Yeah I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it
But don't think I don't think about it
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Don't think I don't wonder 'bout
Could've been should've been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it no no
Don't think I don't
Don't think I don't <start> Just because I asked a friend about him
Just because I spoke his name somewhere
Just because I rang her number by mistake today
He thinks I still care
Just because I haunt the same old places
Where the mem'ries of him linger everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy girl I used to be
He thinks I still care
If he's happy thinking I still need him then let that silly notion bring him cheer
Oh how could he ever be so foolish oh where would he get such idea
Just because I asked a friend about him
Just because I spoke his name somewhere
Just bacause I saw him then went all to pieces
He thinks I still care he thinks I still care <start> Last night I come home and I knocked on my door
I called to my love as I oft had before
I knocked and I knocked but no answer it came
No kisses to greet me no voice called my name
I couldn't believe it was true oh Lord I couldn't believe it was true
My eyes filled with tears I must have aged ten years
I couldn't believe it was true
I let myself in and I walk to our bed
I found a note there and the message it read
The truth like a bolt from the blue in the dawn
My sweetheart had left me my darling had gone
I couldn't believe it was true oh Lord
The shock was so great I am quivering yet
I tried to forgive but I cannot forget
My heartbreaking loss is another man's gain
Her happiness always I hope will remain
I couldn't believe it was true oh Lord <start> When it's just not your day
The whole world's on your case
Tears rollin' down your face
It's more than you can take
I I wanna take care of you
Wanna do it all yourself
Don't want anybody's help
I know your tough as nails
Remember girl when all else fails
I I wanna take care of you
Chorus
Surrender baby I'm right here
Let go of all your doubts and fears
Turn 'em off lay 'em down
All on me right here right now
All those voices in your head
Doesn't matter what they said
Just let me do what I was born to do
I wanna take care of you
When you go and chase your dreams
And give them your everything
Lookin' back it seems
Baby you can count on me
I wanna take care of you
Chorus
I wanna take care of you my baby
Chorus
I wanna take care of you
Yes I'm gonna take care of you <start> I'm sitting in the railway station.
Got a ticket to my destination.
On a tour of onenight stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a oneman band.
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thought's escaping
Home where my music's playing
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.
Ev'ry day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines.
And each town looks the same to me the movies and the factories
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thought's escaping
Home where my music's playing
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.
Tonight I'll sing my songs again
I'll play the game and pretend.
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thought's escaping
Home where my music's playing
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.
Silently for me. <start> I've been lonesome I've been empty I got an achin' way down inside
I need someone someone to hold me
Pull down the shade turn out the light and love me tonight
Don't think about tomorrow it don't matter anymore
We can turn the key and lock the world outside the door
I need you so now come on let go now
Kick off your shoes turn out the light and love me tonight
Now don't you worry we're all alone now let your hair down sit by my side
Turn off the TV put on some music
Pull down the shade turn out the light and love me tonight
Don't think about tomorrow <start> Old heart of clay why do you let her mold you this way
She'll try to shape your life and make me over don't you see
Old heart of clay why do you let her change you this way
The things she'll do to remake you will surely ruinin' me
Everytime I turn around there she is pushing you
And everytime I put her down she cries and says we're through
Old heart of clay don't let her take my lonely soul away
Oh don't you see we must be free both you and me
 steel 
Everytime I turn around... <start> It hurts too much to laugh and I'm too big to cry
Wait and see another hope of love light in your eyes
The day he took your love from me my heart inside me died
It hurts too much to laugh and yet I'm too big to cry
I've often heard it said that grownups never cry
But if that's true I'm still a boy cause my heart cries for you
I tell myself I must forget your love I kept inside
It hurts too much to laugh and yet I'm too big to cry
 steel  fiddle  piano 
I've often heard it said... <start> When your mother went away on the day that you were born
Little angel life seemed all in vain
Then I heard your lonesome cry knew that hope just couldn't die
She was my loss but you were my gain
Little angel with the dirty face God called mother sent you in her place
You brought heaven with your smile and you made my life worthwhile
Little angel with the dirty face
 steel 
Though you're only two years old you're worth more to me than gold
You brought sunshine turned my night to day
And from somewhere up above mother sends to you her love
Watches o'er you while you run and play
Little angel with the dirty face... <start> Have you ever been lonely have you ever been blue
Have you ever loved someone just as I love you
Can't you see that I'm sorry for each mistake I've made
Can't you see I've changed dear can't you see I've paid
Be a little forgiving and take me back in your heart
How can I go on living now that we're apart
If you knew what I've been through you then you'd know why I ask you
Have you ever been lonely have you ever been blue

Can't you see I've changed dear can't you see I've paid
Be a little forgiving... <start> Close your eyes close the door
You don't have to worry anymore
'Cause I'll be your baby tonight
Well that mockingbird is gonna sail away
We're gonna forget it
That big fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon
But we're gonna let it you won't regret it
Kick your shoes off do not fear
Bring that bottle over here
And I'll be your baby tonight
Shut the light shut the shade
You don't have to be afraid
'Cause I'll be your baby tonight
Well that mockingbird is gonna sail away
We're gonna forget it
That big fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon
But we're gonna let it you won't regret it
Kick your shoes off do not fear
Bring that bottle over here
And I'll be your baby tonight
And I'll be your baby tonight <start> I swear you could taste the chicken and tomatoes and the noodles and the marrow bone
But it really wadn't nothin' but some water and potatoes
And the wonderful wonderful soup stone
Hangin' from a string in my momma's kitchen back in the hard time days
Was a little ol' stone bout the size of an apple it was smooth and worn and gray
There wadn't much food in my momma's kitchen so whenever things got tight
Momma'd boil up some water put in the stone say let's have some soup tonight
And I swear you could taste...
It'd been in the family for a whole lotta years so we knew it was a nourishing thing
And I remember momma as he stirred it in the water and we could all hear her sing
It's a magical stone and as long as we got it we'll never have a hungry night
Just add a little love to the wonderful soup stone and everything'll be all right
And I swear you could taste...
So it carried us all through the darkenin' days till finally the sunshine came
And the soup stone started in a gatherin' dust but it hung there just the same
But ever since then Lord the food's been plenty and ever now and then I find
That momma in the kitchen and the wonderful soup stone drifts across my mind
And again I'd taste taste...
We were nourished by the wonderful soup stone oh the wonderful wonderful soup stone <start> Too many years on the rinks of Montreal.
Too many years in the lofts of old TO.
Too many nights in the bowels of Avenue B.
Too many days in the arms of Lady T.
Or maybe I'm just getting old
'cause fuck I hate the cold.
Too much time in the bed of a petty thief.
Too much time in the arms of a failed conceit.
He told me how he love the best about me
And then he told me what was best
And maybe I'm just getting old
But fuck I hate the cold.
Too much fun on the roads of the USA.
Too much fun plugging in and starting to play.
Too much time on this winding trail
Of a tale yet to be told
Baby I'm getting old
And fuck I hate the cold.
I fucking hate it.
I hate the cold.
I fucking hate the cold. <start> BATTLE OF LOVE

  ' Glad Music 

For over a year I've been in love with a girl so sweet
But the guy next door has declared a war and I won't retreat
He hays he could win that pretty girl love in a minute
But I'm gonna show that boy he's not a gonna win it
We're just beginning this mighty battle of love

He was once my friend through thick and thin but now I draw a line
For he wants to be my enemy and try to take what's mine
But I know his plans so I'll take my stand and defend her
He's gonna find that I'm not the kind to surrender
I'm out for winning this mighty battle of love

Now his money's dream and the limousine that he drives is new
I can only offer this heart of mine full of love that's true
I know I'm right and ready to fight for my true love
He's tellin' it all over town that he's got another new love
So I've got to win this mighty mighty battle of love

Now they say all's fair in love and war so may the best men win
And when they say I do I'll be glad to that to meet the best men then
If he wins her love how I ever learn to live without her
Cause here she is in my arms so why should I doubt her
If I'm really winning this mighty battle of love
I'm really winning this mighty battle of love <start> Rita's out on the street tonight
Driving through the rain
She's got lots of new reasons not to trust any man again
And even though she'll be alright
She'll never be the same again
She'll move closer to her mama let her daughter keep her daddy's name
Sometimes you've only got one road and it's a rocky ride
Sometimes there isn't time to think about the tears you've cried
Chorus
You take it as it comes
When you've got no way to hide from the hurting inside
When there's nowhere you can really run
You take it as it comes
Rita's out on the street tonight
Midnight feels so strange
She's got her baby in the car seat
Her sleeping face flashing as the signals change
They roll up to the corner for the seventh time
As they circle around the square
The movie crowd is spilling out across the street
Rita sits at that light and stares
And she wonders if there's any reason in the world to try
And she glances at her little girl and she remembers why
Chorus
And one foot goes in front of the other
And one day rolls into the next
Sometimes you've got to let your heart be numb
And take it as it comes
Chorus <start> It's better than sipping something strong
The way my name rolls off your tongue
The way the light it hits your eyes
And makes me come alive
It moves me more than any song
When you've got that shade of lipstick on
Across the room or by my side
Baby I can feel my heartbeat heartbeat
Pounding my chest you in that dress
Making it jump like a kick drum on repeat
I love the way you make my heart beat heartbeat
There's no mistaking right now it's racing
Every time that you get close to me
Baby I can feel my heartbeat
You make me feel like I could fly
Like some old roller coaster ride
The way you flip your hair
Well girl it gets me every time
You drive me that perfect kind of crazy
Baby I can feel my heartbeat heartbeat
Pounding my chest you in that dress
Making it jump like a kick drum on repeat
I love the way you make my heart beat heartbeat
There's no mistaking right now it's racing
Every time that you get close to me
Baby I can feel my heartbeat <start> I got a little drunk last night
There's something 'bout a midnight rain
Staring at the ceiling fan
I couldn't get you off my brain
I guess I wasn't thinking straight
I couldn't tell wrong from right
I went ahead and called you up
I got a little drunk last night
I brought it all up got it all out
What is it worth to both of us now
It's off my chest but never off my mind
The two drinks in hit that hurt
You feel bad and I feel worse
I swear it's the last time every time
Don't know why
Might've been a song on the radio
Might've been nothing baby I don't know
Might've been a little too tired to fight
Might've been I got a little drunk last night
I got a little too far gone
The heart was talking way too loud
I don't remember what I said
I just remember breaking down
I brought it all up got it all out
What is it worth to both of us now
It's off my chest but never off my mind
The two drinks in hit that hurt
You feel bad and I feel worse
I swear it's the last time every time
Don't know why
Might've been a song on the radio
Might've been nothing baby I don't know
Might've been a girl who looked like you
Might've been a fluke might've been a full moon
Might've been a little too tired to fight
Might've been I got a little drunk last night
Might've been a song on the radio
Might've been nothing baby I don't know
Might've been a girl who looked like you
Might've been a fluke might've been a full moon
Might've been a little too tired to fight
Might've been I got a little drunk
Brought it all up got it all out
What is it worth to both of us now
It's off my chest but never off my mind
The two drinks in hit that hurt
You feel bad and I feel worse
I swear it's the last time every time
I got a little drunk last night
I got a little drunk last night
Thought I could keep it all inside
But I got a little drunk last night <start> She went away and left me
Oh She never said a word
And even if she would have told me
I probably never would have heard
Well she once said no other woman honey
could lay up in her bed
Noe theres cum stains on the pillow
Where she once laid her head
cum stains on the pillow
in the middle of the bed
I found me a true fine momma
and she got some damn good head
but i hope shes out there listening
to every word i said
Cause theres cum stains on the pillow
Where she once laid her head

Here now when she took my Cadilliac
That didnt bother me abit
When she took that blue tick hound
she shouldnt ever done that shit
Never thought Id see the day
Her love would be as dead
as the cum stains on the pillow
Where she once laid her head
Cum stains on the pillow
In the middle of the bed
Found me a too fine momma
and shes got some damn good head
I hope your out there listening
To every word i said
Cause there cum stains on the pillow
where you once laid your head
Yes theres cum stains on the pillow
In the middle of bed <start> Empty all my pockets take away my gold
Stripp me of my innocence leave me in the cold
Rob me of my patience and mess up my mind
If that's all it takes to love you girl
Then a truer love you'll never find than mine
Set my very soul on fire burn it to the ground
Take my little loveless world turn it upside down
Rob me of my patience...
 strings 
Here I am on bended knees I'll do anything to please
Your kind of love to set me free if I could only make you see me
Rob me of my patience... <start> My name is John O'Reilly
And my father worked the fields
In the hills of old Kilarny
Where I helped him turn the wheels
My arms grew hard as iron for a boy of 
And I used my fists for gambling in those wet Kilarny streets
Well the ship left for America and I brought my pack aboard
Said goodbye to my dear Ireland said a prayer to my dear Lord
I fought those sorry guineas in the kitchen they called hell
I fought them for their dollar and those guineas paid me well
Chorus
Fair thee well fair Dover
Fair thee well your seasons turn
For my pockets will be jingling on the day of my return
The day of my return
I fought in New York City and I fought the Jersey shore
My gut stayed full of whiskey and my bed stayed full of whores
They called my right a cannonball and my left they called the same
I left em' all lyin' half in blood and half in shame
I met a man on ' and he stuck out his hand
And he offered me a thousand if I'd fall before his man
I said it could be done but only for another two
He smiled at me and nodded as I stuck it in my shoe
Chorus
They rang the bell two times before I let him have my nose
And I let him work my left until my eye was swollen closed
Then I let loose a right that they still talk about today
For that guinea didn't know that I had bet the other way
They covered every dock and every port there on the coast
Looking for that double crosser who had turned into a ghost
But I was on a train my friend that rode the other way
And i'll sail from California back to Dublin one fine day <start> Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
You say our love is over that you have found another
And you say you're going away
Leave me tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
I've hurt me enough today you can't believe a word that I say
But you must accept the fact I won't be coming back
Oh but stay stay just one more day loneliness isn't far away
Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today <start> God is love and appreciation
Don't miss the mark
God is love and appreciation
Don't miss the mark
I want to feel good
I want to feel right
I want to feel the sun
The piney trees that lead you to the mountains
The stars a wonder in the night
The ocean deep filled with life
Birds in the sky mystery
God is love and appreciation
Don't miss the mark
God is love and appreciation
Don't miss the mark
The crooked tower of the man
Who walks down the hall
Naked in the morning hours
Music from today music from our hearts
Coincidence and fate
God is love and appreciation
Don't miss the mark
God is love and appreciation
Don't miss the mark
Don't miss the mark
Don't miss the mark <start> Slow down girl
You're talkin' much too fast
What's that girl you think your love with him will always last
How can you say that
It's like you're blind 'cause you can't see the truth
Like you forgot all those nights he ran around on you
That's something I'll never do
Chorus
You need to pack your bags this moment
And walk on out that door
Take the early flight to Beaumont
So I can hold you in my arms
And I'll make right all that he's done wrong
And then you'll see I'm the man he'll never be
When you're with him it seems you always fight
Well that's okay it's fine with me if that's what you like
But to make it right
Chorus <start> I'm waiting at the gate looking for my ride
Soon to take me to my home on high
Angel bands a coming From the other side
I don't want to be late I'm waiting at the gate
I can hear the thunder the time's at hand
Joybells are ringing in the promised land
Jesus is a coming my soul to take
Yes my Lord sees me waiting at the gate
I'm a' leaving the world no more to do
All of my work on earth is through
I've fought the fight I've kept the faith
Well I'm ready to go I'm waiting at the gate <start> I've got a confession to make when I first decided to bring you here tonight
I was scared to death I started once to call it off
Run back to my little corner of the world
But then I remembered how soft your lips can be
How tantalizing your body can be
And how great it is to make love to a married lady
Tonight I fell in love with a married lady
She held me in her lovin' arms and she called me baby
And she made me feel all the good things I've missed lately
Tonight I fell in love with a married lady
My life's been pretty crazy lately
But tonight lyin' next to you it all came back into focus
I discovered there's a difference between what matters
And what counts and what counts is being close to you and loving you
And remembering why I married you in the first place <start> At last my love has come along
my lonely days are over and life is like a song
At lastthe skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you
And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven I found my love at last
I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill like I had never known
You smiled when you smiled at me that was how the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
I found my love at last <start> There is a name I love to hear
I love to sing its worth
It sounds like music in mine ear
The sweetest name on earth
Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me
It tells me of a Savior's love
Who died to set me free
It tells me of His precious blood
The sinner's perfect plea
Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me
It tells of One whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe
Who in each sorrow bears a part
That none can bear below
Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me
Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me <start> I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the starlight
Just like we used to do
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searching for you
I walk for miles along the highway
Well that's just my way
Of sayin' I love you
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for you
I stop to see a weeping willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm as lonesome as I can be
I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the moonlight
Just ahopin you may be
Somewhere awalkin' after midnight
Searchin' for me
I stop to see a weeping willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm as lonesome as I can be
I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the moonlight
Just ahopin you may be
Somewhere awalkin' after midnight
Searchin' for me
I go out walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for you <start> Well a twister tore the roof off a grocery store
Blew an Idaho potato through the hardwood floor
Twirled granny's apron up around her head
The cat's still missin' and the dog is dead.
Well ain't love a lot lot that
Ain't love a lot like that
Unconditional unpredictable
Ain't love a lot like that
Just like Moses and the Red Sea water
A little bit of faith and the ring I bought her
I hit my knees and she took my hand
And she lead my heart to the promised land.
Ain't love a lot lot that
Ain't love a lot like that
Unconditional unpredictable
Ain't love a lot like that
Well the honeymoon's over and the work begun
My baby say I'm gettin' on her nerves again
One false move and an angry shout
I'm sleepin' all alone on the fold out couch.
Ain't love a lot lot that
Ain't love a lot like that
Unconditional unpredictable
Ain't love a lot like that
Ain't love a lot that
Now ain't love a lot like that
Unconditional unpredictable
Ain't love a lot like that
Unconditional unpredictable
Ain't love a lot like that
Ain't love a lot like that <start> Just between the two of us we know our love is gone
People think it's wonderful our love can be so true
You never say an angry word no matter what I do
And you have so much faith in me you trust me anywhere
But the reason if they only knew is that we just don't care
Just between the two of us let's give up this fantasy
For we no longer care enough to even disagree
Everybody envies us and the way we get along
But just between the two of us we know our love is gone
Wish we could go back again to days that used to be
We fought a lot but even then I knew you cared for me
Now we get along so well no teardrops ever fall
But there's no love no anything there's nothing left at all
Just between the two of us let's give up this fantasy
For we no longer care enough to even disagree
Everybody envies us and the way we get along
But just between the two of us we know our love is gone <start> Makin' memories to last the lifetime
A lifetime I'll be living without you
It feels so good to be in your arms tonight
And to think it's the last time don't seem right
But let's be happy to the end
As parting sweet sorrow begins
Makin' memories to last the lifetime
Countin' every minute left with you
Makin' memories to last the lifetime
A lifetime I'll be living without you
So hold me forever tonight
And kiss me a thousand goodbyes
And don't let sadness cross my mind
But leave happy memories behind
Makin' memories to last the lifetime
I'm lovin' every minute left with you
Makin' memories to last the lifetime a lifetime
I'll be living without you <start> Love lifts me up
When I'm down at heart
And fills me with a hope that we can start
To change the way we feel
With just a glimpse
Of something real
Every night
We hold on tight
Love makes us strong
If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong
When the world is wicked
And worse for wear
Love's the ticket
To anywhere
It's a journey deep inside
Lift you up into
The wild blue sky
A better life
Is clear in sight
So come along
If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong
What a complicated
Work of art
This power driven thing
We call the heart
It runs on pure emotion
Stronger than a ragin' ocean
Heaven knows how it flows
On and on
If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong
If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong
If your heart is right
You can't go wrong <start> Another summer day
Has come and gone away
In Paris and Rome
But I wanna go home
Maybe surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel all alone
I wanna go home
Oh I miss you you know
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
I'm fine baby how are you
I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that
Another airplane
Another sunny place
I'm lucky I know
But I wanna go home
I've got to go home
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I wanna come home
And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not
Come along with me
This was not your dream
But you always believed in me
Another winter day has come and gone away
In even Paris and Rome
And I wanna go home
Let me go home
And I'm surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel alone
And I wanna go home
Oh I miss you you know
Let me go home
I've had my run
Baby I'm done
I'm coming back home
Let me go home
It will all be all right
I'll be home tonight
I'm coming back home <start> My hopes are high
My guard is down
I'm in a place I never dreamed
I've heard it happens everyday
Well it's my turn
Dare I say
Oh look at me
I have never been so taken in
This is a fight I cannot win
I'm yours
Take me as I am
And I never thought I'd get caught up in a feeling
My heart can't ignore
This is what I've been waiting for
Baby I'm yours
I laid my heart out on the line
Now I know it was worth the risk
Cause when I see you smile I just fall
Oh I surrender all
I just can't resist
I have never been so taken
This is a fight I cannot win
I'm yours
Take me as I am
And I never thought I'd get caught up in a feeling
My heart can't ignore
This is what I've been waiting for
Oh baby I'm yours
I had to let my heart go
Do to circumstances beyond my control
I have never been so taken
This is a fight I cannot win
I'm yours
Take me as I am
And I never thought I'd get caught up in a feeling
My heart can't ignore
This is what I've been waiting for
Oh baby I'm yours <start> I met a man
Traveling down the road
He looked me in the eye
And he gave me a ring
And he gave me a rose
And he told me some gypsy lies
The road is a lover you never recover
Not now or any time soon
My head starts to spin
When I think where I've been
Playin' twin to an old fiddle tune oh
As the wind chases after the moon
Through the kindness
Shown me that day
I gave him this melody
And we sang in duet
'Neath the stars in the sky
And the shadows of dancing trees
The road is a lover you never recover
Not now or any time soon
My head starts to spin
When I think where I've been
Playin' twin to an old fiddle tune oh
As the wind chases after the moon <start> Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the clouds
To hide its face and cry
Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die
That mean's he's lost his will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry <start> He hung the moon
Raised the sun
Made the lions walk
And the rivers run
Then he sat down looked around
And thought a bit
Said it's all good but that ain't quite it
So with his mighty hand he created man
And then
Chorus
He had a better idea
A much better idea
He made an angel like sweet perfume
A heavenly smile someone who
Can light up a room with a heart so true
I thank God he created me
But when I look at you I see
He had a better idea
Thought I'd have to face
This world alone
Just walk through life
Without a hand to hold
And I accepted that
I said in fact it might be nice
To live my way
Now that's paradise
Be he knew all along
I was wrong
Chorus x <start> Here I sit in this gin mill
an empty in my hand
The telephones three steps away
but I can hardly stand
Got five pennies in my pocket
but Lord I'm gonna need ten
Cause I gotta phone my baby
to come and pick me up again
And I'm down to my last come
and get me
Just the way she said I'd be
so many times before
And I'm down to my last come
and get me
Well I wonder if I'm worth the
come and get me anymore
Promises I've made to her
Lord knows I tried to keep
but there's always something
somewhere makes the strongest
man get weak
And there ain't no use in runnin'
and there's no place left to hide
when ya drunk up all yer promises
and passed away your pride
And I'm down to my last come
and get me
Just the way she said I'd be
so many times before
And I'm down to my last come
and get me
Well I wonder if I'm worth the come
and get me anymore <start> Standing here on this cold ground
Tears falling down in the dirt
This world keeps spinning round and round but
You're lying still in the dirt
Don't wanna swim in this darkness
Drown in a whiskey sea
But there's no making sense of the senseless while this
Pain is killing me
There's not a stone in my heart I've left unturned
Not a piece of my soul that I ain't searched
The only answer I found for all this hurt
Is there ain't not answer here on earth
I ain't the best of believers
Ain't at the front of the church
I've read the words of the teacher but I
Still struggle with what it's all worth cause
There's not a stone in my heart I've left unturned
Not a piece of my soul that I ain't searched
The only answer I found for all this hurt
Is there ain't not answer here on earth
I wish that I could be stronger
I wanna have that kind of faith
But even if I did I still wonder 'cause
Nothing would change
You're gone you're gone you're gone you're gone you're gone
'Cause you're gone you're gone you're gone you're gone you're gone
Please help me believe
I'm on my knees
Help me believe
There's not a stone in my heart I've left unturned
Not a piece of my soul that I ain't searched
The only answer I found for all this hurt
Is there ain't not answers here on earth
Down here on earth
There's no answers here on earth
Here on earth <start> Hey the dusty Miller
And his dusty coat
He will win a shilling
Or he win a groat
Dusty was the coat
Dusty was the colour
Dusty was the kiss
That I gat frae the Miller.
Hey the dusty Miller
And his dusty sack
Leeze me on the calling
Fills the dusty peck
Fills the dusty peck
Brings the dusty silver
I wad gae my coatie
For the dusty Miller. <start> Of all the people in this world why you and I
With lovers here and everywhere we don't care enough to try
Why couldn't all the hurt we're feeling now have passed us by
Couldn't love have picked a better place to die
And of all the hearts in all the world why yours and mine
There's so many places love could die we must leave the earth for a time
Oh but it's in our hearts and it's in our bed and it's even in your eyes
Couldn't love have picked a better place to die
Somewhere out there there's lovers who want to be free
Why couldn't love have died with them instead of here with you and me
Oh but it's pitiful how all these tears won't bring it back to life
Couldn't love have picked a better place to die
Oh but it's pitiful how all these tears won't bring it back to life <start> We're just a pair of old sneakers
Stringin' each other along
Sometimes i feel just like a heel
'cause i know in my soul that it's wrong
We're just a pair of old sneakers
Kickin' each other around
Eight times a week we play 'hide an' cheat'
'Til we've run that game in the ground
We're just a pair of old sneakers
We know that cheatin' is wrong
We're just a pair of old sneakers
And we've been in the closet too long
We're just a pair of old sneakers
Worn out an' comin' unglued
Both wearin' rings feelin' ashamed
Tryin' to run from the truth
We're just a pair of old sneakers
And nothin' can tear us apart
Living the lie and lord knows we've tried
To stop walking on each other's heart
We're just a pair of old sneakers
We know that cheatin' is wrong
We're just a pair of old sneakers
And we've been in the closet too long
We're just a pair of old sneakers
And we've been in the closet too long <start> Talk about life talk about death
Talk about catching every breath
Talk about when and talk about why
Talk about do and talk about don't
Talk about will and talk about won't
Talk about the sweet... bye and bye
Chorus
Well talk is cheap and times are wasting
Get busy living or at least die trying
Wine is for tasting roads for taking
Talk is cheap and times are wasting
Talk about right and talk about wrong
Talk about trying to get along
Talk about the way it all would be.
Talk about now and talk about then
Talk about everywhere you've been
Talk about being free.
Chorus x
Well talk is cheap and times are wasting
Get busy living or at least die trying
Wine is for tasting roads for taking
Talk is cheap and times are wasting <start> Let's dance Uh

There's a little girl living in my neighborhood
Her name is Charlotte Johnson mmm mmm lookin' good
I had to go and see her so I called her on the phone
Walked over to her house and this was goin' on
Her brother was on the sofa eatin' chocolate pie
Her momma was in the kitchen cuttin' chicken up to fry
Her daddy was in the back yard rollin' up a garden hose
And I was on the porch with Charlotte feelin' love down to my toes
And we were swingin' 
Yeah we were swingin' 
Little Charlotte she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe it started on the front porch in a swing
Just swingin'  Just swingin' 
Now Charlotte she's a darlin she's the apple of my eye
When I'm on the swing with her it makes me oh so high
Now Charlotte is my lover and she has been since the spring
I can't believe it started on her front porch in the swing
And we were swingin' 
Yeah we were swingin' 
Little Charlotte she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe it started on the front porch in a swing
Just swingin'  Just swingin' 
And we were swingin' 
Yeah we were swingin' 
Little Charlotte she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe it started on the front porch in a swing
Just swingin'  Just swingin' 
Here we go
Me and Charlotte sittin' on the porch swing
Eating moon pies sipping on the Real Thing
Daddy comes out with a  gauge shotgun
Had a flashback from his days in Viet Nam
Honey please you're my daughter
I guess she forgot all the things I taught her
Shot gun blast my ears ringing on the front porch
UH
And we were swingin' 
Yeah we were swingin' 
Little Charlotte she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe it started on the front porch in a swing
Just swingin'  Just swingin' 
That's what we were doing
Swinging
There's your money in the bank...two step to that
There's a little girl living in my neighborhood
Her name is Charlotte Johnson mmm mmm lookin' good
Now Charlotte is my lover and she has been since the spring
I can't believe it started on her front porch in a swing
Here we go
Me and Charlotte sittin' on the porch swing
Eating moon pies sipping on the Real Thing
Daddy comes out with a  gauge shotgun
Had a flashback from his days in Viet Nam
Honey please you're my daughter
I guess she forgot all the things I taught her
Shot gun blast my ears ringing on the front porch
UH
And we were swingin' 
Yeah we were swingin' 
Little Charlotte she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe it started on the front porch in a swing
Just swingin'  Just swingin' 
That's what we were doing
Swinging
There's your money in the bank two step to that
Don't touch that knob there might be some jam on it
Too much jam on it Too much jam on it
Too much jam on it <start> You say the time has come for you to go
Why you've decided this I'll never know
You say you've lost the love you felt for me
Well baby you won't find it if you leave
Pardon me if I don't understand
How a love like ours can turn out bad
You tell me I'll be fine alone
Without the love I'm leaning on
Well pardon me if I don't understand
I can't see how you'll be happy far away
But what's best for you is not for me to say
So I'll try to keep my feelings to myself
But forgive me if I don't do too well
Pardon me if I don't understand
How a love like ours can turn out bad
You tell me I'll be fine alone
Without the love I'm leaning on
Well pardon me if I don't understand <start> I'm gonna head down to the coast
Where nothing ever seems to matter
You know I love it there the most
When every piece of my world gets scattered
Blue skies green water
White birds in the air
Brown skin blue collar
And the wind blowing in my hair
And I wrote you this little note
And I never even sent the letter
But I still want you to know
I found a place I feel a whole lot better
With blue skies green water
White birds in the air
Brown skin blue collar
And the wind blowing in my hair
Blue skies green water
White birds in the air
Brown skin blue collar
And the wind blowing in my hair
I'm gonna leave my old winter coat
And I won't even need a sweater
I'm gonna sit out on a boat
'Cause it's time for some sunny weather
And blue skies green water
White birds in the air
Brown skin blue collar
And the wind blowing in my hair
In my hair
Blue skies green water
White birds in the air
Brown skin blue collar
And the wind blowing in my hair
And the wind blowing in my hair <start> Well I'm only human I'm just a man
It don't make no difference who I am
I've climbed some mountains
And I've tumbled down
I've been a king I've been a cloud
Chorus
So Heaven leave the light on
It's dark and I can't see
So Heaven leave the light on
Burn like a fire for me
And I won't have no problem askin' please
Heaven leave the light on for me
Well I've heard of mansions and streets paved in gold
Yeah I know that's where I want to go
But how do you get there
Yes I've heard 'em say
That if you have to ask then you don't know your way
Chorus
If I see the river I'm not afraid to die
'Cause I know I'll find the other side
So Heaven leave the light on
It's dark and I can't see
So Heaven leave the light on
Burn like a fire for me
And I won't have no problem askin' please
Heaven leave the light on
It's dark and I can't see
So Heaven leave the light on
Burn like a fire for me
And I won't have no problem askin' please
Heaven leave the light on for me yeah <start> 
Everybody asks me if I still love you and if you're still on my mind
They ask me to tell 'em bout my broken heart I tell 'em that I'm feelin' fine
I lie a little bit and I proudly say our book of love is closed
And your memory seldom bothers me and when it does it comes and goes
It comes and goes all right it comes every morning and it goes all night
I say with lotta pride and I haven't really lied I just tell 'em that it comes and goes

Everybody asks me if I cried when you left and if I've cried for you since
They hope I have so they can all get together and laughin' up at my expense
So I lie a little bit and I proudly say not one teardrop flows
When there is a little pain it's not a constant pain it kinda just comes and goes
It comes and goes all right
I tell 'em that it comes and goes <start> It's the little things that mean the most to me
Like wakin' up with you this close to me
Watch the sunrise there in your eyes
Sleepy smile tangled hair
Mornin' love girl I swear
This is the life the one we're livin'
These are the days we've been given
This is the love now and forever
And we only get one chance to live it right
This is the life
Life is funny let's just laugh at it
Who knows what's comin' after it
Our days are numbered filled with wonder
Let's raise our glass to the years
Make love last while we're here
Oh this is the life the one we're livin'
These are the days we've been given
This is the love now and forever
And we only get one chance to live it right
Oh this is the life this is the life <start> I called you today
Wanting a change
I never meant to hurt anyone
Never meant for you to pull out your guns
But feelings won't stay
In this meager parade
You're beating to a different drum
In this lack of all the luster we've become
Save your breath
You know we've both
Tried our best
But it's leaving
This might as well be done
I'm falling with the sun
When the hours getting sour won't save with time
I'm waving off the one
Who wouldn't let me run
Though we tried it's a lie I can't keep dragging on
I'm untying this sinking stone
Don't sit on the fence
Living past tense
Holding on to wishes and words
Folding out a picture we blur
'Cause here in the end
I'm losing a friend
Fighting back a tear when it burns
Dividing up the pieces that we were
Save your breath
You know we've both
Tried our best
But it's leaving
This might as well be done
I'm falling with the sun
When the hours getting sour won't save with time
I'm waving off the one
Who wouldn't let me run
Though we tried it's a lie I can't keep dragging on
I'm untying this sinking stone
I can't say you're all alone
I'm accepting what I own
Here lies a blanket and not a bandage
I'm unable to restrain
When the wake that we became
Is drawing me under
This might as well be done
I'm falling with the sun
When the hours getting sour won't save with time
I'm waving off the one
Who wouldn't let me run
Though we tried it's a lie I can't keep dragging on
This might as well be done
I'm falling with the sun
When the hours getting sour won't save with time
I'm waving off the one
Who wouldn't let me run
Though we tried it's a lie I can't keep dragging on
I'm untying this sinking stone <start> You can't mix angels and alcohol
I don't think God meant for them to get along
When it takes control you can't love no one at all
You can't mix angels and alcohol
You can't blend whiskey with a good woman's love
They don't go together love's already hard enough
You think you can handle how it feels or what it does
You can't blend whiskey with a good woman's love
You can't change lonely with a bottle of wine
It might ease the heartache for one short easy time
In the end you have to face what's hiding in your mind
You can't change lonely with a bottle of wine
You can't mix angels and alcohol
An angel once loved me I traded it all
I let the bottle drive my life into a wall
You can't mix angels and alcohol <start> Munster RAD  is instrumental... <start> Take love from a boy take love from a girl and you might as well take away the world
We're living to love and dissociety two minus one equals one one lonesome me
Wrapped in your arms gave me strenght of a king
And all of the warm things two arms can bring
Two equals two then one should leave
That makes two minus one equal one one lonesome me
 guitar 
With your lips on mine I had reason to live
And knowing your wants makes me willing to give
But I never dreamed you'd want to be free
Now two minus one equals one one lonesome me
Wrapped in your arms... <start> I could tell you that I was a christian
And I don't guess that would be a lie
I could tell you that I was church of christ
And I don't guess you could prove me wrong
So don't trouble no policeman
He's got a wife and kids of his own
And don't trouble yer neighbor
Cause they just want to be left alone
I suppose if I was a demon
I might have bugs all over my legs
It might make sense for me t'tangle
With my wife for awhile
So don't trouble no policeman
He's got a wife and kids of his own
And don't trouble yer neighbor
Cause they just want to be left alone
Lord ain't this nation lonely <start> I go out walking after midnight
Out in the moonlight just like we used to do
I'm always walking after midnight searching for you
I walk for miles along the highway
Well that's just my way of saying I love you
I'm always walking after midnight searching for you
I stopped to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow maybe he's crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night blooms will whisper to me I'm lonesome as I can be
I go out walking after midnight out in the moonlight
Just hoping maybe you're somewhere walking after midnight searching for me
I stopped to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow maybe he's crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night blooms will whisper to me I'm lonesome as I can be
I'm out walking after midnight out in the moonlight
Just hoping maybe you're somewhere walking after midnight searching for me <start> The hopeful the possibilities have come an' gone away.
We've both run out of reasons to stay.
Who we are and who we thought we were has somehow changed.
We kept tryin' anyway.
It's just not gonna work it's just not gonna fly.
We've been frozen on the edge starin' at goodbye.
We've both reached for the stars
Shared the victories shared the scars
Made each other's dreams come true.
I never thought I'd do my dreamin' without you.
Oh you'll go one way an I'll go mine an' take some awkward steps.
Almost free except for these regrets oh yeah.
An' movin' on's the only thing that we have left to do.
Noone can say we didn't see this through.
But it's just not gonna work it's just not gonna fly.
We've been frozen on the edge starin' at goodbye.
We've both reached for the stars
Shared the victories shared the scars
Made each other's dreams come true.
I never thought I'd do my dreamin' without you.
No.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you.
We've both reached for the stars
Shared the victories shared the scars
Made each other's dreams come true.
I never thought I'd do oh my dreamin' without you.
Mmmm <start> I had sunk as low as a man could go
The world had turned me down
Then you picked me up and you kissed me sweet
You changed a beggar into a king.
Yes you took the rags from off of my back
And you gave me your love to keep me warm
Yes you picked me up and you kissed me sweet
And changed a beggar into a king.
I had walked the streets with my head bowed low
The sun for me would never shine
Then you came along into my life
And changed a beggar into a king.
Yes you took the rags from off of my back
And you placed a crown on my head
Yes you picked me up and kissed me sweet
You changed a beggar into a king. <start> I am a roving gambler I've gambled all around
Whenever I need with the deck of cards I lay my money down
I've gambled down in Washington I've gambled over in Spain
I'm on my way to Tennessee to get down my last game
I had not been in Washington many more weeks than three
When I fell in love with a pretty little maid who she in love with me
She took me in her parlor she cooled me with her fan
She whispered low in mother's ear I love that gambling man
 guitar 
Oh daughter oh dear daughter how could you treat me so
To leave your dear old mother and with the gambler go
Oh mother my dear mother you know I love you well
But the love I have for the gambling man no human tongue can tell
No human tongue can tell no human tongue can tell
 guitar 
I wouldn't marry a farmer he's always in the rain
I wouldn't marry a railroad man who's always on a train
I wouldn't marry a doctor he's always gone from home
All I want is the gambling man fore he leave me alone
 guitar 
I hear a train a coming a coming roun the curve
A whistlin' and a blowin' and strainin' every nerve
Oh mother oh dear mother I'll tell you if I can
If you ever see me coming back I'll be with that gambling man <start> I will see you in the morning
When the moonlight leaves the trees
But I will always feel the embers
Of the flames in Tennessee
I was sleeping when they came knocking
They said boy you better leave
Said South Nashville is rocking
And they can't get no relief
So I run and put my pants on
And I run to get my car
But the flames they was a rising
And I didn't get to far
There was a black man on the corner
He said boy just turn away
I got a gun here in my pocket
And I will take your life away
So I showed the man your picture
And I said we had a son
And I was just up here from Texas
I wasn't hurting anyone
So I run out to the highway
And I finally caught a ride
With some white trash outta towner
With his wife and kids inside
So I sit here on the roadside
And I talk to your machine
I can see the flames a rising
Over Nashville Tennessee
Well don't go out looking on your TV
They gonna keep this all discreet
They will never tell the secrets
Of the flames in Tennessee
You know I hope she don't discover
That this all was all just a lie
But If I don't get home to see her
Then my heart will surely die
I will see you in the morning
When the moonlight leaves the trees
But I will always feel the embers
Of The flames in Tennessee
The night they burned down Nashville Tennessee <start> That red Georgia clay when mixed with the rain
Sure made for one nasty mess
Ah but we were ridin' high in that old truck of mine
In deep as we could get
Always looking for a rut tryin' not to get stuck
And slinging that mud everywhere growin' up down there
Me and my friends where the deep river bends
Had a long rope tied to a tree
Takin' turn on the swing takin' turns takin' drinks
And I don't mean iced tea
A good buzz later playing chicken with the gators
Way too young to be scared growin' up down there
And those tan little peaches turnin' us on
Keepin' things hot all summer long
If I could go back in a second I swear
Well I'd still be growin' up down there
Well nothin' going on never lasted too long
We were good at makin' good times
Find a fieldspread the word keep a bonfire burnin'
Through both ends of the night
Had the radio up had a keg in the truck
And tryin' to get licky somewhere
Growin' up down there
And those tan little peaches turnin' us on
Keepin' it hot all summer long
If I could go back in a second I swear
Well I'd still be growin' up down there
And those tan little peaches turnin' us on
Keepin' it hot all summer long
If I could go back in a second I swear
Well I'd still be growin' up down there
Yeah lookiin' back now man it don't seem fair
If you didn't get to do your growin' up down there <start> Carry me back to old Virginny
There's where the cotton and the corn and tatoes grow
There's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime
There's where the old darke'ys heart am long'd to go
There's where I labored so hard for old massa
Day after day in the field of yellow corn
No place on earth do I love more sincerely
Than old Virginny the state where I was born.
Carry me back to old Virginny
There's where the cotton and the corn and tatoes grow
There's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime
There's where this old darkey's heart am long'd to go.
Carry me back to old Virginny
There let me live 'till I wither and decay
Long by the old Dismal Swamp have I wandered
There's where this old darke'ys life will pass away.
Massa and missis have long gone before me
Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore
There we'll be happy and free from all sorrow
There's where we'll meet and we'll never part no more. <start> Walk through this world with me go where I go
Share all my dreams with me I need you so
In life we search and some of us find I've looked for you a long long time
Now that I found you new horizons I see
Come take my hand and walk through this world with me
 dobro 
Walk through this world with me go where I go
Share all my dreams with me I've searched for you so
Now that I found you new horizons I see
Come take my hand and walk through this world with me
Come take my hand and walk through this world with me <start> LOSING YOUR LOVE

' Moss Rose Publications
RECORDED BY JIM REEVES
I filled up my pockets with money big trophies I've hang on my wall
My mansion sits high on the hilltop and the world is impressed by at all
But to me always all this glory is worries and I've not been successful enough
For while I was willing the whole wide world I was losing your love
I forgot to kiss you and hold to your charms
Success seems like nothing to these empty arms
All this time I've been gaining a treasure that I can even speak partly of
For while I was willing the whole wide world I was losing your love
Slowly losing your love <start> Chorus
Down the road down the road
I've got a sugar baby down the road.
Down the road a mile and a half
I swapped my horse for a cow and calf.
Down and road across by the shop
My old hat's got a hole in the top.
Chorus
Down the road till you come to the turn
Rocks in the road as big as a churn.
Chorus <start> Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again
What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I've cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come
And that crying time for me had just begun
'Cause today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again <start> These streets all know me the shadows whisper
Tonight keeps looking back at me with neon eyes
And if they've seen you they're not talking
You think by now maybe they'd sympathize
Out in the rain I keep on walking
Out in the rain like the brokenhearted do
I could be wrong but that's where you'll find me
Out in the rain just looking for you
The sky is cryin' the wind's against me
Blows like some fugitive with no place left to hide
I'm down to nothing but just this heartache
That I keep carrying around inside
Out in the rain <start> If I send for my baby and he don't come
If I send for my baby man and he don't come
All the doctors in hot springs they sure can't help him none
And if he gets unruly things he don't want to do
And if he gets unruly and thinks he won't do
I'll take my  now and cut him half in two
I'm gonna shoot my pistol I'm gonna shoot my gatling gun
Yeah I'm gonna shoot my pistol I'm gotta shoot my gatling gun
You made me love you now your man have come
Baby where you stay last night
Yeah I said baby where'd you stayed last night
'cause you got the hair all tangled and you ain't talkin' right
Where'd you stayed last night
He got a . special but I believe it's most too light
He got a . special but I believe it's most too light
I got a  got to make the camps alright
If I send for my baby man and he don't come
If I send for my baby man and he don't come
All the doctors in hot springs sure can't help her none
Her . special boys do it very well
Her . special boys it do very well
I got a  now and it's a burnin'
If I send for my baby man and he don't come
If I send for my baby man and he don't come
All the doctors in wisconsin sure can't help him none
Hey hey baby where'd you stay last night
Hey hey baby where'd you stay last night
You didn't come home until the sun was shining bright
Ahoh boy I just can't take my rest
Ahoh boy I just can't take my rest
With this  laying up and down my breast <start> We are
Counting the stars
Out in the night
Round an old yellow moon
With you
Right by my side
I got nothing to hide
From an old yellow moon
And now
As I turn back the years
So little I've learned
About heartache and tears
Chorus
But still
I'm making my way
Into the heart
Of an unknown highway
We are
Following stars
Way cross the sky
Round an old yellow moon
Chorus
We are
Counting the stars
Out in the night
Round an old yellow moon
Out in the night
Round an old yellow moon <start> Why do you treat me as if I were only a friend
And what have I done
That's made you so different and cold
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be contented again
Will you be happy when you are withered and old
I cannot offer you diamonds or mansions so fine
I cannot offer you clothes your young body crave
But if you'll say that you long to forever be mine
Take off the heartaches the tears and the sorrow you'll save
While I am writing this letter I think of the past
And of the promises that you are breaking so free
But to this world I will soon say my farewells at last
I will be gone when you read this last letter from me <start> After sundown comes suffertime for me.
And I go to that small cafe where we used to meet.
I'll have the special for today cause nothing matters to me
Just make my coffee cold and black oh like my future's gonna be
And let me cry to a sad song for he's still on my mind
And excuse me for not talking it's my suffertime
I know I'll never crave a new love I had a taste of one so fine
And for this love I'll go on starving and suffer my whole lifetime
Oh would you play just one more sad song yes he's still still on my mind
Then I'll see you again tomorrow at suffertime <start> After you have known me better and the new wears off
Will you want me just as much as you do now
After I am your possession will the thrill be gone
Will you want me then as much as you do now
How long does forever mean to you
Does it mean you'll always love me Or is it just a line you use
After I am yours completely will you change your mind
Will you want me just as much as you do now
How long does forever mean to you
Will you want me then as much as you do now <start> I sell the morning paper sir my name is Jimmy Brown
Everybody knows that I'm the newsboy of the town
You can hear me yelling Morning Star as I run along the street
I've got no hat upon my head no shoes upon my feet
I sell the morning paper sir my name is Jimmy brown
Everybody knows that I'm the newsboy of the town
Never mind sir how I look don't look at me and frown
I sell the morning paper sir my name is Jimmy Brown
I'm awful cold and hungry sir my clothes are mighty thin
I wander 'bout from place to place my daily bread to win
I sell the morning paper sir my name is Jimmy Brown
Everybody knows that I'm the newsboy of the town
My father was a drunkard sir I've heard my mother say
And I am helping my mother sir as I journey on my way
My mother always tells me sir I've nothing in the world to lose
I'll get a place in Heaven sir selling the gospel news
I sell the morning paper sir my name is Jimmy Brown
Everybody knows that I'm the newsboy of the town <start> The sense to see and I saw you walk away the sense to feel I feel lonely everyday
The sense to hear for I heard you say goodbye
The sense to taste now I taste the tears I cry
My senses tell me all I need to know it's over and I don't have the sense to let you go
It doesn't make much sense for me to cry for you
If I had any sense at all I'd realize we're through
My senses are reacting much too slow
It's over and I don't have the sense to let you go
Oh yes it's over and I don't have the sense to let you go  <start> Stepchild you've had a hard way to go
How come your daddy run away your mama never did know
All you remember is becoming a step son to your mama's new man
And you got acquainted with the back of his hand
Stepchild you say the man had a son
The son called him daddy but he told you to call him John
You say the legs on the breast of the chicken was gone
When the platter come around your way
And you had to chop cotton while your step brother played
Stepchild when you were born
Your right foot was turned left with your left
And mercy had a way of taking off and leaving you by yourself
Stepchild muddy water got in your well
Stepchild how come your laughing that way
After doing the deed that you've done you better learn how to pray
Stepchild you've got a weird sense of humor
And you came close to gettin' away
But they caught you plantin' garlic on your step daddy's grave
Stepchild when you were born <start> Three weeks in Phoenix one night to go
You're lookin' too good and you're standing to close
That song on the jukebox
Your dancewithme smile
Has got me thinkin' of someone
I haven't seen in a while
You sure know how to make a man lonesome
I see so much of my woman in you
You sure know how to make a man lonesome
But she knows how to keep her man true
Yes I know that it's early
Why am I leaving so soon
Well it's too warm in here
And it's me not the room
And the way that you're starin'
I've seen that look before
You're makin' me want her all that much more
You sure know how to make a man lonesome
I see so much of my woman in you
You sure know how to make a man lonesome
But she knows how to keep her man true <start> Train train
Gonna take him on out of this town
Train train
Gonna take him on out of this town
Yeah that man I'm in love with
Lord he's Memphis bound
He's leavin' here
Like a raggedy old coat
Oh he's leavin' me
That no good soandso
Yeah that man I'm in love with
Lord he wants to go
Let him go
Goodbye goodbye
I'll find myself another man
Goodbye goodbye
I'll find myself another man
You take that night train to Memphis
Me I'll make new plans
Take that night train to Memphis
Oh leave while you can <start> 
We might have slept in a rail yard or camped by the river bank
We fed ourselves from the fruit of the land
And quenched our thirst with rain
We never did allow no roots to grow beneath our feet
Life just had no pattern for Gypsy Joe and me
All we had was each other and the rags upon our back
The closest thing to a home we new was some abandoned shack
But we had all we needed and the rest we didn't need
Life was free and simple for Gypsy Joe and me
Now Gypsy was my little dog I found by the road in a ditch
And so I named him Gypsy cause that name just seemed to fit
Oh and Joe he was my man the flower of my soul
Thou he never said he loved me I just always seemed to know
While standing by the highway thumbin' for a ride
The speeding wheels of a passing car took Gypsy's life
I lost him where I found him and his loss was misery
Now there's no more Gypsy there's just Joe and me
Well the winter came and the snow did fall
And the night was cold and still
And the rags we wore were not enough
And Joe he caught the chill
And he told me how he loved me
And in my arms he went to sleep
Now there's no more Gypsy no more Joe there's just me
While standin' here on the edge of this bridge
Lookin' down I see
The face of Joe and Gypsy lookin' back at me
And somewhere in the distance I can hear them callin' me
Tonight we'll be together again
Gypsy Joe and me <start> I reckon there's one near your hometown
An old cinder block building looks ahalf torn down
Just hang a left down the lost highway
Keep going till you see the signs that say
Honky tonk if you love country
Honky tonk your whole life long
Honky tonk if you love country
That's what keeps this country strong
Them little ladies in the kitchen can't be beat
They've got your hardboiled eggs and your pickled pig feet
Don't you try to order no imported beer
That truck only runs from St. Louie to here
Honky tonk if you love country
Honky tonk your whole life long
Honky tonk if you love country
That's what keeps this country strong
All the girls get frisky on Friday night
When the band starts playing don't you be surprised
We do things different when we start to rock
Yeah we hop on the hip and we hip on the hop
Honky tonk if you love country
Honky tonk your whole life long
Honky tonk if you love country
That's what keeps this country strong
We'll be the life of the party at the party of your life
You might even meet your next exwife
Ain't no better place for you to be
In the home of the brave and the land of the free
Honky tonk if you love country
Honky tonk your whole life long
Honky tonk if you love country
That's what keeps this country strong
Honky tonk if you love country
Honky tonk your whole life long
Honky tonk if you love country
That's what keeps this country strong <start> Todo lists on a long yellow legal pad
Blue Windsor knots framed by basic black
Resplendent tables
Great forests of paper plates
Carrying the weight of the world
Saps every ounce of your strength
In training to run a marathon
Miles and miles and miles
With your Sunday shoes on
In training to run a marathon
Miles and miles and miles
With your dress shoes on
But all the recurring dreams
Will increase and then peter out and cease
Tears do evaporate
But oh so slowly like piss on toilet seat
In training to run a marathon
Miles and miles and miles
With your Sunday shoes on
In training to run a marathon
Miles and miles and miles
With your dress shoes on <start> Sundogs barkin' barkin' round my dreams
Three ring circus rockin' round the sun
The taste of fire and Julia's name
Right there on the tip of my tongue
I was on the mountain
And the sun was goin' down
All I's wishin' for was Julia
I kissed her on the mouth I looked her in the eye
I's actin' half my age and feelin' way too proud
I drove into the desert I drove up to the sky
I parked it and I left it just a hangin' on a cloud
I was on the mountain
The first star was shinin' down
All I's wishin' for was Julia
Night wind blows
Stars above the blue
Heaven knows
Only love will do
Now what's a few miles between the beauty and the beast
What's it mean when angels keep flying by above
Storm clouds gatherin' round the full moon in the east
I was emptyheaded but my heart was full of love
I was on the mountain
Lightnin' all around
All I's lookin' for was Julia
The more you need her help the more she let's you down
The more you like the way she walks the more she shakes her hips
The more you fall in love with life the more she runs around
The more you fear the kiss of death the more she licks her lips
I was on the mountain
There was thunder rumblin' down
All I's listenin' for was JUlia
Night wind blows
Stars above the blue
Heaven knows
Only love will do
I was on the mountain
I was never comin' down
All I's thinkin' bout was Julia
All I's thinkin' bout was Julia <start> The year is two thousand and eighty
And hardly a highway remains
Gone are the days of the diesel
And songs about wrecks in the rain
The Macs and MacLeans have all rusted away
The Harvesters rot in the sand
And in a deserted truck stop sits Tennessee Thompson
The world's last truck drivin' man
He lit up the world's last Lucky
Got his last cup of coffee refilled
Then he stared at the sky for one final high
Took the world's last little white pill
He said world you are losin' your truckers
And your suckers do not give a damn
You're freightin' in space and there just ain't no place
For a hard ridin' truck drivin' man
The world's last truck drivin' man
His left arm is losin' its tan
The rest all went broke and just went up in smoke
He's the world's last truck drivin' man
Then he sat there and drank to old mem'ries
And Doreen sat there dryin' his tears
Doreen was the world's last truck stoppin' waitress
She was weary and worn with the years
So he put his last dime in the world's last jukebox
For the lady he'd loved for so long
And there in that deserted truck stop they danced
To the world's last truck drivin' song
Then he climbed up inside his ol' semi
And Doreen she crawled up at his side
He shifted it down and the diesel's sad sound
Said this is your last homeward ride
So he whispered  to her and the Lord
As the microphone fell from his hand
And he came to the exit marked Tennessee Thompson
The world's last truck drivin' man
He was high ballin' straight through them bright pearly gates
When behind in the dust of his rig
Come the wailin' siren of ol' Smokey McKenzie
The world's last interstate pig
Hear 'em roar see 'em fly past the clouds through the sky
On that highway that don't have an end
But you know that's heaven for Tennessee Thompson
The world's last truck drivin' man and Doreen
The world's last truck drivin' man
 and gone <start> Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind a cloud
To hide its face and cry
Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves began to die
That means he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I'm so lonesome I could cry <start> KEY LIME PIE

It ain't rained and all the crops are dying on the vine.
Give me more time.
You gotta give me more time.
That farm's been in my family going on a hundred years.
We've pulled through hard times before with blood sweat and tears.
Give me more time
I need more time.
Oh what would he give for a little more time
Two lovers at a table candlelight and wine
One's looking for an answer the other one can't find.
Give me more time You gotta give me more time.
She says You know I love you but my heart's in a bind
Afraid youre gonna leave me if I don't make up my mind.
Give me more time I gotta have more time.
Some have barely any some too much on their hands.
Some would give anything to have it back again.
A patient and his doctor meet behind closed doors
You kidding me How could this be I'm only . Give me more time
You gotta give me more time give me more time. <start> Only you can make this world seem right
Only you only you can make the darkness bright
Only you and you alone can thrill me like you do
And fill my heart with love for only you
Only you can make this change in me
For it's true you are my destiny
When you hold my hand I understand the magic that you do
You're my dream come true my one and only you
Only you only you can make this change in me
For it's true you are my destiny
When you hold my hand I understand the magic that you do
You're my dream come true my one and only you <start> Here's to the corners yet to turn
Here's to the bridges yet to burn
Here's to the whole thing blown apart
It's open season on my heart
Days go by like flying bricks
Leave gaping holes too deep to fix
I'd just stay home if I were smart
It's open season on my heart
I can't blame anyone but me
For this restless fool I've come to be
My tired excuses just don't fit
It don't look good from where I sit
I tried to change without much luck
I reach a point where I get stuck
I hit the streets and the fireworks start
It's open season on my heart
I can't be something that I'm not
I can't give you what I haven't got
I don't know where I'll while away
I only know the shape of you
Here's to the clown down in the mouth
Here's to the whole thing going south
Just stay home if I were smart
It's open season on my heart
I hit the streets and the fireworks start
It's open season on my heart <start> You brought me happiness
When I had none
Made me believe that I
Could be someone
Just like the sun you always shine for me
What am I gonna do
Now that I don't have you Marie
You over looked the fuss that others saw
You said they only made
You love me more
Some said it proved how blind
True love can be
What am I gonna do
Now that I don't have you
Marie
A traveler with no star
To guide me
A love song in search of a key
A prisoner of love
Locked inside me
Beggin to be free
Oh I lost it all
When I lost you
Marie
You where the sparkle
In this old fools eyes
And now my heart begins
To realize
Your love will turn into a memory
Where am I gonna go
After loving you so
Marie <start> You know I am a dreamer
When my heart is gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
Doesn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song
And you'll never feel left all alone
Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm coming off this long and winding road
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight tonight
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
You know that I seen
So many romantic dreams
Up in lights
Fallin' off the silver screen
My heart's like an open book
For the whole world to read
Sometimes nothing  that keeps me
Together at the seams
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight tonight
I'm on my way
To set me free
Home sweet home
Ooooo
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Yeaa
I'm on my way
To set me free
Home sweet home <start> Well she puts her dancing shoes on every night
And comes alive there in the smoke beneath the neon lights
And she don't like those hurtin' songs
Cause she's already lived 'em
She don't get the blues she gives 'em
She checks her broken heart there at the door
She ain't looking for romance she's danced that dance before
Well I pity the next poor fool that gets caught up in her rhythm
Cause she don't get the blues she gives 'em
She's been on the losing end of love too many times
And she ain't gonna go for anything you've got in mind
So before you start let me impart
These few words of wisdom
She don't get the blues she gives 'em
Chorus
She don't get the blues she gives 'em <start> Breakfast black coffee one slice of dry toast no butter no jelly no jam
Lunch just some lettuce two celery stalks no booze no potatoes no ham
Dinner one chicken wing broiled not fried no gravy no biscuits no pie
And this dietin' dietin' dietin' dietin' sure is a rough way to die
So pass me a carrot stick peel me a prune a glass of skim milk and that's all
Turn off the TV for the Big Mac commercial it's drivin' me right up the wall
And I'm thinkin' of french fries sausage and waffles spaghetti and cookies and cake
And each night I'm dreamin' of chocolate ice cream
And I'm starvin' to death when I wake
 guitar 
Supper two pieces of cauliflower raw some beefsteak the size of a nail
One sliced tomato a small dab of slaw I swear I ate better in jail
Stop eatin' that pizza right under my nose girl that's the least you can do
Put down that candy bar while I'm singin' I'm starvin' my pants off for you
You're fixin' the kids all those creamed mashed potatoes
But it's bouillon and water for me
Hey you got a lock on the refrigerator Lord knows where you're hidin' the key
While I'm starvin' for food late at night I'm starvin' for lovin' from you
But you say that when I can see my own dick you'll be glad to look at it too
So pass me a carrot stick peel me a prune a glass of skim milk and that's all
You and Jane Fonda and old Richard Simmons are drivin' me right off the wall
Now when I am dead with the insurance paid you'll look down at me and you'll grin
You'll say well the boy tried and he suffered and died
But don't he look good when he's thin oh my
And this dietin' dietin' dietin' dietin' sure is a rough way to die <start> You make my heart beat too fast
You make me want this to last
You make me spend all my money
Oh I think I love you honey
You make me think I could miss you
You make me think I should kiss you
You make me want your affection
I want to make a connection
Baby I'm psychedelic with emotion
And I can't come down
My heart playin' dead
But love changes everything around
Around around around
I wanna ride in your car
I wanna know where you are
Why don't you make me your fool
Come on baby take me to school
You make me want to be sweet
You make me walk down your street
You make me dance to your beat
I'm gonna save you a seat
Baby I'm psychedelic with emotion
And I can't come down
My heart plays dead
But love changes everything around
Around around around
You're making me lose my focus
You've got some bad hocus pocus
You make me think that you're clever
I'm gonna love you forever <start> Now I'm a fellow with a heart of gold
With the ways of a gentleman I've been told
A kind of a fellow that wouldn't even harm a flea
But if me and a certain character met
That guy that invented the cigarette
I'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree
That ain't that I don't smoke myself
And I don't reckon they'll injure your health
I've smoked 'em all my life and I ain't dead yet
But nicotine slaves are all the same
At a pheasant party or a poker game
Everything's gotta stop when they have that cigarette
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette
Puff puff puff
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
Now at a game of chance the other night
Ol' Dame Forson wasn't doin' me right
Them kings and queens just kept on comin' round
Well I got a full and I bet it high
But my plug didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept a risin' and a layin' that money down
He's raise me and I'd raise him
I sweated blood I had to sink or swim
He finally called and he didn't raise the bet
I said aces is full pal how about you
He said I'll tell you in a minute or two
But I just gotta have another cigarette
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette
Puff puff puff
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
The other night I had a date with
The cutest gal in the fifty states
A high bred uptown social little dame
She said she loved me and it seemed to me
That things were like they ought a be
So hand in hand we strolled down Lover's Lane
She was oh so far from a chunk of ice
And our smoochin' party was a goin' real nice
So help and I think I'd of been there yet
But I give her a hug and a little squeeze
And she said Willie excuse me please
But I just gotta have another cigarette
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette
Puff puff puff
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette
Puff puff puff
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
Just gotta have another cigarette <start> Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time
Life is bare gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor old self together
I'm weary all the time the time
So weary all the time
When she went away the blues walked in and they met me
If she stays away that old rockin' chair's gonna get me
All I do is pray the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more
Can't go on everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time
Keeps rainin' all the time
all backups
female backups only 
all backups 
all backups 
Can't go on everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time the time
Keeps rainin' all the time <start> FROM HERE TO THE DOOR

  ' Glad Music 
Well it's only my love you are taking
And it's only my heart you are breaking
For you it will be only footstep you're taking
But it's my lifetime from here to the door
From here to the door is your freedom
To you a short walk cross the floor
If you go now this house will be a prison
Cause it's my lifetime from here to the door
There you stand now but I guess that you're going
Where I failed you of no way of knowing
To you it's no more than a cold wind that's blowing
It's my lifetime from here to the door
From here to the door is your freedom...
Yes it's my lifetime from here to the door <start> The most famous of the voodoo queens that ever existed
Is Marie Laveau down in Louisiana
There's a lot of weird ungodly tales about Marie
She's supposed to have a lot of magic potions spells and curses....
Down in Louisiana where the black trees grow
Lives a voodoo lady named Marie Laveau
Got a black cat's tooth and a Mojo bone
And anyone who wouldn't leave her alone
She'd go another man done gone
She lives in a swamp in a hollow log
With a oneeyed snake and a threelegged dog
She's got a bent bony body and stringy hair
If she ever seen why'all messing round there
She'd go another man done gone
And then one night when the moon was black
Into the swamp come handsome Jack
A no good man like you all know
He was looking around for Marie Laveau
He said Marie Laveau you handsome witch
Give me a little a little charm that'll make me rich
Give me a million dollars and I tell you what I'll do
This very night I'm gonna marry you
Then It'll be another man done gone
So Marie done some magic and she shook a little sand
Made a million dollars and she put it in his hand
Then she giggled and she wiggled and she said Hey Hey
I'm getting ready for my wedding day
But old handsome Jack he said goodbye Marie
You're too damned ugly for a rich man like me
Then Marie started mumbling her fangs started gnashing
Her body started trembling and her eyes started flashing
And she went another man done gone.
So if you ever get down where the black trees grow
And meet a voodoo lady named Marie Laveau
If she ever asks you to make her your wife
Man you better stay with her for the rest of your life
Or it'll be another man done gone <start> I didn't think too much about books and schoolin'
Cause there was more important things to do
I'd just sit out in the yard and pick my old guitar
Tryin' to do what the big hillbillies do
I would sit there by the hour pickin' wildwood flower
Wore my little fingers to the bone
Well I said I would never rest 'til I am the very best
The best guitar picker in this whole county
I said someday I know I'll win my fame
One day all the world will know my name
I worked so very hard with that old guitar
Tryin' to do what the big hillbillies do
I would sit there all alone tryin' to pick out old sweet home
While everyone was in the yard
Well I said I would never stop 'til I've reached the very top
The best guitar picker in the whole county
The years have passed I haven't changed my mind
Cause I still pick the guitar all the time
Because I know someday I'm bound to learn to play
All the things the big hillbillies do
I just sit her in my shop pickin' foggy mountain top
Tellin' everybody ain't that great
Cause before I go to rest I'm gonna be the very best
The best guitar picker in this whole county
I would sit there by the hour pickin' wildwood flower
Wore my little fingers to the bone
But I said I would never rest til' I am the very best
The best guitar picker in this whole county <start> Santa looked like daddy
Or daddy looked like him
It's not the way I had him pictured
Santa was a much too thin
He didn't come down the chimney
So momma must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy
Or daddy looked a lot like him
Well they thought I was fast a sleepin'
They thought I was tucked in bed
They never thought I'd come a peepin'
Or that I'd hear what was said
Santa put his arm around mama
And mama put her arm around him
So if Santa Claus ain't daddy
Then I'm a gonna tell on them
Well Santa looked like daddy
Or daddy looked like him
It's not the way I had him pictured
Santa was a much too thin
He didn't come down the chimney
So momma must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy
Or daddy looked a lot like him
I never saw Dancer or Prancer
I never heard the sleigh bells ring
I never saw the Red Nosed reindeer
Like they show on the TV screen
But he sure brought a lot of presents
So Santa Claus he must have been
Well he sure looked a lot like Daddy
And daddy looked a lot like him
Well Santa looked like daddy
Or daddy looked like him
It's not the way I had him pictured
Santa was a much too thin
He didn't come down the chimney
So momma must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy
Or daddy looked a lot like him... <start> You find the thrill each time you let me down you know if you need me I'll be around
And when all your love affairs come to an end you know you can fool me again
Fool me again make my heart believe that your sweet sweet love belongs to me
Yes play the part and let my heart pretend come back and fool me again
The same old line that keeps me hanging on is all I think about when I'm alone
And though I know how our love affair will end come back and fool me again
Fool me again <start> I watched you walk into the room
I want to say this just right
If you ain't waitin' for somebody special
Would you be with me tonight
I'm a doctor I'm a lawyer I'm a movie star
I'm an astronaut and I own this bar
And I'd lie to you for your love
I'd lie to you for your love
I'd lie to you for your love that's the truth
I can tell you what you wanna hear
Awesome secrets 'bout myself
I can tell you you're the only one baby
There'll never be nobody else
Yeah I'm runnin' for president I got money to burn
My heart don't ache and my body don't yearn
And I'd lie to you for your love
I'd lie to you for your love
I'd lie to you for your love that's the truth
Maybe it would be easier just to come out and say it
I ain't never seen a woman quite like you
My family comes from royalty on my daddy's side
And I can read your palms and cards and tell you
Our love just can't be denied
I'm a doctor I'm a lawyer I'm a movie star
I'm an astronaut and I own this bar
And I'd lie to you for your love
I'd lie to you for your love
I'd lie to you for your love that's the truth
That's the truth <start> When the bottom fell out
There wasn't any doubt
I just suddenly found myself free falling
And from such a height
The wind it had a bite
And it took all my might to fight the fight
The fell in spreadeagled
Must've found an airfoil
Or some kinda wing
And I gained some equilibrium
Caught myself gliding
When the bottom fell out
Observers heard me shout
So long It's been good to know you
But when I finallly smash
Into that vertin' grass
I will say It's been pretty great going <start> It's almost twelve o'clock but what's one more night
Among so many nights I sit here all alone
Though I must admit by now I'm used to it
And I'm not surprised that you're not home
Since you've grown tired of me I guess eventually
I'll get tired too of waiting some night
But until I do would it be too much to ask of you
To just call me and tell me you're all right
It would only take a dime and the time it takes to call
And all I want to know is that you're all right that's all that's all
I know that it's too late we're gonna separate
I'd be a fool to think we could go on
And I know by now how I've failed you as a wife somehow
And some of my feelings for this shell of a home are gone
Yes it's too late for me and you there's not much left for us to do
But I still worry about you every night <start> Oh I know I'm only dreaming.
'Cos I'll awake and you'll be gone.
And my tears will still be streaming.
As my broken heart beats on.
Yes I know I'm only dreaming.
But Ill just keep dreaming on.
I will dream about the pleasures.
That we shared in days gone by.
And I'll remember and I'll treasure
Every kiss and your kind eyes.
And I will dream that you still hold me
In your arms as you did then.
And I recall each thing you told me
Hear your voice as I did then.
Yes I know I'm only dreaming.
But I'll dream and I will too.
I'll be here and I'll be waiting
And I will dream of your return.
Some will say I'm being foolish
While some will say that I'm just blind.
And that I want to face what the truth is
That you are no longer mine.
But I will dream you'll be returning
To some sweet day to their surprise.
You will say your love's still burning
You'll dry each tear drop from my eyes.
But I know I'm only dreaming
Cause Ill awake and be alone.
And my tears will still be streaming
And you will still be just as gone.
Yes I know Im only dreaming
But I must keep dreaming...on <start> Will Santy come to Shanty town to a poor little boy like me
Will he bring me some toys like the other girls and boys
Will Santy come to Shanty town if he sees our Christmas tree
Mommy said he would if I promised to be good
For we don't have a fireplace or a chimney on our shack
Like the other lucky children have who lived across the track
Now if I say my prayers each day when Christmas rolls around
Will Santy come to Shanty town
 guitar 
He didn't stop last Christmas Eve doesn't he know we live here
Will my mommy have to paint my toys the way she did last year
Now if I say my prayers each day... <start> He said there's no future back here in these hills
His mind grew so restless he couldn't be still
Though I knew I might lose him and all I dreamed of
Still I send my baby to Chicago with love
Big city don't hurt him don't change him I pray
Keep him the same sweet boy as when he went away
He'll never know how often I pray to God above
To send down his blessings to Chicago with love
Well I just got his first letter he's got a job and things are looking fine
He keeps sorry he didn't write me before but he just didn't have a time
He says I've got a lotta new friends now honey the Chicago sure is a swingin' place
And by the way I just got married
And I'll be bringin' in home with me one of these days
Big city don't hurt him <start> I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main roads
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singin' in the wires
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line
I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
If it snows that stretch down South
Will never take the strain
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line <start> He said settle down cowgirl
Let me tell how its gonna be
You and me leave that suitcase packed for the sorrow
I'ma take you home to Tennessee to your family
Said my chariot awaits to carry me out of these gates
Of this prison we been living to long
Chorus
Just bring love thats all your gonna need
Bring love bring your love to me
I said lookey here cowboy
I always got a lot to say
And then I said OK
We set our sights on the brightest star
Left L.A. headed east across New Mexico
And took it slow
Dust the paths of my past of life don't live to fast
I'll be going with my Joe lead the way
Chorus
He said settle down cowgirl
Let me tell how its gonna be
You and me as the sun set behind us in Jackson
Two well traveled souls headed home
Back home I said tell me again what I need to begin
To live a life in the light of your love
Chorus x
Bring love thats all your gonna need <start> My better sense is telling me I just might oughta be
turning my eyes away from you
Start thinking bout something else other than how I felt
when I saw you walk in the room
My rational side is sending me a message
telling me I'd better hold back
But here I go anyway
nothing I can do or say.
Hearts don't think like that.
Chorus
Hearts don't think like ordinary people do
they just jump right in
Sink or Swim
Pull you right in there too
Hearts don't care
They just fall right where they're at
We scrutinize and we analyze
But hearts don't think like that
I'm here rackin' my brain
Tryin' to figure out a game plan
But I can't get one yet
Wanna stay in control
Put love on hold
Keep my emotions in check
Its just mind over matter
But here's the grabber
I might have to face the fact
That love could slip right through my lips
Cause hearts don't think like that.
Chorus
Hearts don't think like ordinary people do
they just jump right in
Sink or Swim
Pull you right in there too
Hearts don't care
They just fall right where they're at
We scrutinize and we analyze
But hearts don't think like that
Chorus
Hearts don't think like ordinary people do
they just jump right in
Sink or Swim
Pull you right in there too
Hearts don't care
They just fall right where they're at
We scrutinize and we analyze
But hearts don't think like that <start> We've only known each other since the moment we met
But it seems like forever to me
I haven't figured out the perfect way to say it yet
But I suppose at times like these
A man should get down on his knees
Chorus
How'd ya like to be in my wedding
 how'd ya like to walk down the aisle
You could be the center of attention
Everyone would look at you and smile
We could send our friends invitations
You could wear a long white dress
If you'd like to be in my wedding darlin'
All ya have to do is say 'Yes'
Your folks could be seated in the very front row
And cry when we all turn to look at you
We could cut the cake
And we could strike a pose
Like the little bitty plastic bride and groom
And then begin our lifelong honeymoon
Chorus

Say 'yes'
Say 'yes'

Please say 'yes'

Say 'yes'


 <start> Rock of Ages clef for me let me hide myself in Thee
It was a stylish congregation you could see they had been around
And they had the biggest pipe organ of any church in town
But over in the amen corner of that church sat Ol' Brother Ire
And every Sunday he insisted on singing in the choir
His voice was cracked and broken age had touched his vocal chords
And nearly every Sunday he would get behind and miss the words
Well the choir got so flustered the church was told then fine
Brother Ire must quit his singing or the choir is going to resign
So the pastor appointed a committee I think it was three or four
They got in their big fine car drove up to Ire's door
They found the choirs great trouble sitting there in a big armed chair
The summers golden sum beam lay up on his snowwhite hair
Said York We're here with the Vestry's approbation
To discuss a little mater that affects the congregation
Now it seems your voice is interfering with the choir
So if you will just lay out are you listening Brother Ire
The old man raised his head a sign he did hear
And on his cheek the three men caught the glitter of a tear
His feeble hands pushed back the locks as white as silky snow
And he answered the committee in a voice both soft and low
I wonder if beyond the tide that is breaking at my feet
In that far off heavenly temple where my Master I shall meet
I wonder if when I try to sing the songs of God up higher
Will they kick me out up there for singing in Heavens Choir
A science filled the room the old man bowed his head
The committee went on back to town but Brother Ire was dead.
The choir missed him for awhile but it soon forgot
A few church goers watched the door but the old man entered not
From far away his voice is sweet now and he sings his hearts desires
Where there are no committees and no fashionable choirs
Rock of age's clef for me let me hide myself in Thee <start> Here I sit all alone just a wonderin' why
You must have slipped out while I was high
I know just how it feels and I'm not blamin' you
'Cause if I had to choice I'd avoid me too
I've heard tell people say I'm half worth nothin' at all
While that may not be true
Dead to rights
It sure ain't landin' far wrong
There's little question or none
Wasn't much you could do
And if I had the choice I'd avoid me too
Now I'm having fears and doubts
Right along with everyone else
And here lately I'm not so sure
I should even be seen with myself
But here I sit all alone just a wonderin' why
I guess you slipped out while I was high
I know just how it feels and I'm not blamin' you
'Cause if I had the choice I'd avoid me too
If I had the choice
If I had the choice
If I had the choice
I'd avoid me too <start> Here you are on the back of my mind again
Don't guess it's gonna get any better
Is your memory ever gonna end
Or does it go on forever
I was the one when you left town
Said I'd get along somehow
Didn't take long to find out
That I was wrong
Look at me now
Nothin' but a whole lot of time on my hands
Look at me now
Thought I wouldn't need you
Now I understand
You said I was never gonna learn
Look at me now
I was so busy looking out for myself
I know I must have took you for granted
Didn't want to make room for someone else
Didn't know love when I had it
You were the one who set me free
But you can lay the blame on me
Come my way and you'll see
I have changed
Calling your name in the quiet of the night
Seeing your face every time I close my eyes
It's always the same
I keep hoping that you might
Look at me now
Standing here holding my heart in my hands
Look at me now
Wishing I'd told you we could still start again
What I'd give if you'd turn
And look at me now
Here you are on the back of my mind again <start> Darkness darkness be my pillow
Take my hand and let me sleep
In the coolness of your shadow
In the silence of your deep
Darkness darkness hide my yearning
For the things I cannot see
Keep my mind from constant turning
To the things I cannot be
Darkness darkness be my blanket
Cover me with this endless night
Take away oh this pain of knowing
Fill this emptiness with light
Emptiness with light now
Darkness darkness long and lonesome
As the day that brings me here
I have found the edge of sadness
I have the known the depths of fear
Darkness darkness be my blanket
Cover me with the endless night
Take away oh this pain of knowing
Fill this emptiness with light now
Emptiness with light now now
Darkness darkness be my blanket
Cover me with the endless night
Take away oh this pain of knowing
Fill this emptiness with light now
Oh with light now
Darkness darkness be my pillow
Take my hand and let me sleep
In the coolness of your shadow
In the silence of your deep
In the silence of your deep
In the oh oh hey yeah oh yeah
In the summer baby
Oh yeah oh in the summer baby
In the summer baby
Ooh yeah
Come on come on come on come on baby
Come on come on come on baby
Come on come on come on baby
In the summer time baby
In the summer time <start> I miss you already and you're not even gone
The time has come you're telling me goodbye
I know that I can't stop you if I try
I've had way too many chances now I'll have to set you free
I watch you go too late I know how much you mean to me
Yes I miss you already I don't know how I'll go on
I miss you already and you're not even gone
So kiss me once again and please don't cry
And I promise there'll be no more alibis
I'll have to find myself a way to face this loneliness
I watch you go too late I know I've lost my happiness <start> 
Like the leaves I get restless
I just can't seem to settle down
When the autumn wind blows it cuts right to my soul
And pulls my roots out of the ground
Chorus
Lonesome why do you love me you won't leave me
Why can't we ever be apart
Just when love finds me your chains they bind me
Forever shackled to your heart
Lonesome why do you love me
Rain ain't fallin on my windshield
But there's tears in my rearview
Nature's dyin I know behind she's cryin
Why do we leave them sad and blue
Chorus
You won't leave me
Chorus
Why do you love me
You won't let me be won't set me free
Lonesome why do you love me <start>  over and out
The way we talk sometimes you'd think our love is filled with doubt
But when we're all alone by the fireside of our home
The angry words we spoke that day have forever gone away
Then it's love we talk about to the world outside we say
 over and out
Hello this is Unit  callin' Unit  this is Unit  tryin' Unit 
Do you read me Unit  do you read me
  over and out
 over and out...
This is Unit  callin' Unit  do you read me Unit  you better answer me Unit 
I'm gettin' sick of foolin' around with this CB radio
I'm gonna cram this thing down your throat

Oh I believe you I really do believe you ole CB and you  over and out
 over and out...
 baby I'm gonna have to be clear with you I'm always movin' on
Oh you've never been clear in your life you was born
I'm gonna get rid of this radio it's gonna get me killed I tell you
I'm gonna have to get rid of that radio just as soon as we get home
Everybody in the country knows what we're talkin' about too
They listen in on us I know I know <start> Heart shaped smoke rings
Dancing off the end of your lips
Sneaking out the back of your throat
And coming out between your fingertips
All I can think about
Is all that I can think about
And I keep thinking 'bout it
Thinking 'bout it
I wanna be a cigarette
Smoking on so cool
Or maybe that red wine
You're drinking down so smooth
I wanna be the fire
That's taking you higher
Girl you can leave me
And let me burn
I wanna be your cigarette
Cigarette
A big bad barfly
Slidding up beside your hips
Trying to get close to you
Just take another drag
Take another sip
All I can think about
Is all I can think about
And I keep thinking 'bout it
Thinking 'bout it
I wanna be a cigarette
Smoking on so cool
Or maybe that red wine
You're drinking down so smooth

I wanna be the fire
That's taking you higher
Girl you can leave me
And let me burn
I wanna be your cigarette
Cigarette
I don't wanna your number
I don't want your name girl
I don't wanna waste your time
I don't want your heart girl
I could only break it
I don't wanna wreck your mind
I wanna be a cigarette

Smoking on so cool
Or maybe that red wine

You're drinking down so smooth

I wanna be the fire
That's taking you higher
Girl you can leave me
And let me burn
I wanna be your cigarette
Cigarette
Oooo I wanna be your cigarette
Oooo I wanna be your cigarette
I wanna be your cigarette
Cigarette <start> 
Once I've traveled in the valley so low lonely and weary way I
Now I travel in the valley no more yeah I'll reach the other side by and by
Well well I'm climbing up the mountain to the sky

Well well I'm climbing... <start> All of me belongs to you all the time you're the only one that's ever on my mind
There's no way that I could ever be untrue
There's not one single part of me that don't miss you through and through
All of me belongs to you
Eyes are worthless if you're not here to see
Lips're so forgotten since you forgotten me
My arms ached from reachin' out to you the way they do
There's not one single part of me that don't miss you through and through
All of me belongs to you
Fingerls claw the darkness in my dreams searching for a love I've lost I can't redeem
I'm yours and I can't give my heart to someone new
There's not one single part of me that don't miss you through and through
All of me belongs to you
 steel 
Fingerls claw the darkness in my dreams...
All of me belongs to you <start> Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost oh but now I'm found was blind but now I see
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relived
How precious did that grace appear the hour I have first believed
When we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun
Amazing grace how sweet the sound <start> All of my life I've looked for love but somethin inside said it wasn't enough. Then there was you and that's when i knew it was true. And it feels so right with you here tonight with all of my heart my soul and my mind would you put you're hand in mine

chorus x <start> I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun
For another overload
I hear you singin' in the wires
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman
Well he's still on the line
I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
If it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the same no
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Well he's still on the line
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
He's still on the line
Still on the line still on the line
He's still on the line he's still on the line
The lineman still on the line
He's still on the line still on the line <start> Beside the cottonfield I was born underneath the tree was my home
A flock of geese flew overhead
Wind from the wings fall down to me come go with us that's my way
It grieves me much to see you cry I'll break a heart with my goodbye
I warned you ahead of time
I could never say I'm sorry but it has to be that's my way
That's my way to try to find a place I've never been
Before directions master me and distance is my friend
I try to put a lifetime into each and every day that's my way
I yearn to love but it can't be for fear of what's inside of me
With the each day setting of the sun
A passin' train stirs my soul like winds of long ago that's my way
That's my way that's my way that's my way <start> Won't you tell me Molly darling
That you love none else but me
For I love you Molly darling
You are all the world to me
Oh tell darling that you love me
Put your little hand in mine
Take my heart sweet Molly darling
Say that you will give me time
Molly fairest sweetest dearest
Look up darling tell me this
Do you love me Molly darling
Let your answer be a kiss
Molly fairest sweetest dearest
Look up darling tell me this
Do you love me Molly darling
Let your answer be a kiss <start> Oh love's a merry go round so Mary go round with me
Won't you takin' a ride deep down inside you know you'll never be free
And it was love we found on the merry go round so now for all the world to see
Whether wrong or right we're back in love tonight so Mary go round with me
It seems like yesterday that you and I fell in love
And a thousand dreams ago we said goodbye
But seeing you tonight it's as though time has stood still
And all the love we knew before shines in your eyes
Cause love's a merry go round
Whether wrong or right we're back in love tonight so Mary go round with me <start> It's good to hear your voice after all this time
I've been told I'm hard to find
It's raining here but I'm keeping dry
And for me that's doing good
To tell the truth there ain't much to know
I've dealt some cards and I've rodeo'd
But I haven't found that pot of gold
Like I said I would
Between the high lines and the fence posts
The interstate and the dirt roads
No matter how the wind blows I hear your name
Out of all the things I've done that I regret
There's only one I'd like to change
Out here between the rainbows and the rain
I spent last month in Santa Fe
I heard your daddy passed away
And I should've called your momma
To say how sorry that I am
Well I don't think I'll be coming back
Spent too long so I guess that's that
It's nice to know that you still ask about me now and then
Between the high lines and the fence posts
The interstate and the dirt roads
No matter how the wind blows I hear your name
Out of all the things I've done that I regret
There's only one I'd like to change
Out here between the rainbows and the rain
Out here between the rainbows and the rain <start> In the silence before the morning breaks
I listen to every breath he takes
I look at him and my heart aches
I love him and he will be mine
He opens up those baby blues
When he looks at me I can't refuse
He lets me know his heart beats true
I love him and he will be mine
Chorus
He's all I ever want or need until the end of time
I'll show him what he means to me
I love him and he will be mine
I'm grindin' up some coffee beans
As he slips into his faded jeans
He looks at me and my heart sings
I love him and he will be mine
My baby he's a workin' man
With a gentle touch from callused hands
He holds me like nobody can
I love him and he will be mine
Chorus
Turnin' my world upside down
Spinnin' my head around and around
Better not try and drive my car
'Cause when he kisses me than I see stars
In the silence before the morning breaks
I listen to every breath he takes
I look at him and my heart aches
I love him and he will be mine
Chorus <start> I hate love
what's it ever done for me
but cause me a lot of grief
lost me a lot of sleep
Every time I say I've had enough
I'm never doing that again
I wind up falling right back in.
I hate love.
I hate love
It's nothing but a losing game
Never worth the price you pay
You find out every time you play
When you think
You're finally wising up
It shows up in a new disguise
And hits you right between the eyes
I hate love.
Chorus
Into each life some rain must fall
But it feels like I've got more than I deserve
When the sun comes out and shines on me
Somehow I always wind up getting burned
Chorus
Into each life some rain must fall
But it feels like I've got more than I deserve
When the sun comes out and shines on me
Somehow I always wind up getting burned
I hate love
Cause every time I'm not in it
I try but I can't forget
Just how good it is
Here I go again.
I've been hit by the bug
There's really nothing I can do
But fall in love with you
I hate love. <start> I don't need another drink of Johnny Walker Red
And I don't need another drag off a Marlboro cigarette
And I don't need me telling myself everything's gonna be alright
And I don't need me lying here alone again tonight
I need my girl I need my baby
I need you ninety miles an hour down the interstate
Headlights shining in the driveway
In my arms and I need you right now
I don't need nothing else baby in this world
I just need my girl
I don't need those buddies of mine taking me on the town
Or a TV preacher warning me bout the road I'm going down
I don't need to let 'I'm sorry' not roll off my lips
And I don't need to let my pride talk me out of this
I need my girl I need my baby
I need you ninety miles an hour down the interstate
Headlights shining in the driveway
In my arms and I need you right now
I don't need nothing else baby in this world
I just need my girl
Like I never needed anything before
Like my life depends on you walking through that door
I need you girl
Oh I need you girl
I need my girl I need my baby
I need you ninety miles an hour down the interstate
Headlights shining in the driveway
In my arms and I need you right now
I don't need nothing else baby in this world
I just need my girl
I just need my girl
I just need my girl
I just need my girl <start> 
The bright lights of the city are a pretty site to see
Perhaps they're extra pretty to a country girl like me
Temptation waits at every turn and it won't let me be
So mama when you pray tonight
Say a special prayer for me
I miss your tender goodnight kiss of love and understanding
The goodnight kisses I get now are cruel and so demanding
So mama when you pray tonight
And while you're on your knees
Mama say a special prayer for me
The nights get cold and lonely
When you're faraway from home
And lonely makes it easy for a good girl to go wrong
Evil eyes search through the night for lonely girls like me
So mama when you pray tonight
Say a special prayer for me
I miss your tender goodnight kiss of love and understanding
These goodnight kisses I get now are cruel and so demanding
So mama when you pray tonight
And while you're on your knees
Mama say a special prayer for me <start> Wanna find some boy rip his heart right out
First man I see gonna take him down
It ain't the Christian thing to do they say
But someone somewhere's gotta pay
And if it wasn't for guys like you there wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah even I'm surprised how easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it wasn't for guys like you there wouldn't be songs like this
Broke my TV pawned my guitar
After maxing out my credit cards
You lied much to much and you lied again
Caught you on the couch with my best friend
And if it wasn't for guys like you there wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah even I'm surprised how easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it wasn't for guys like you there wouldn't be songs like this one
That tell the whole world just what a jerk you are
And if it wasn't for guys like you there wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah even I'm surprised how easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it wasn't for guys like you there wouldn't be songs like this
No if it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this <start> I heard my neighbor's rooster crow
Early in the day
I heard his axe beyond the hill
And now I'm bound away
For some men love the city life
Some men crave the town
But I'll be bound for the lonesome woods
Where I can settle down
Chorus
Fiddle and a bow and the fire light's glow
You can hear that lonesome sound
I'll leave behind my troublin' mind
And go the whole world 'round
The red squirrel leaves when the gray squirrel comes
The eagle nests alone
A hundred miles from a wagon track
Is where I'll build my home
Chorus
I've seen the old man whittlin' wood
I've seen the streets of town
I'll pack my goods for the Arkansas woods
And there I'll settle down
Chorus x <start> Someone's gonna get hurt before you're through
Someone's gonna pay for the things you do
How many will it take how many hearts must break
Just to satisfy you just to satisfy you
Another love another fool to play your game
Another love another fool they're all the same
Someone's gonna get hurt before you're through
Don't be surprised if that someone is you
You're gonna find when it's too late a heart that just won't break
Just to satisfy you just to satisfy you
You're gonna find when it's too late a heart that just won't break
Just to satisfy you just to satisfy you just to satisfy you just to satisfy you <start> Last night you told her
That you could never hold her
'Cause a cowboy's just got to be free
Her heart was breaking
And yours was aching
But you saddled up and followed your dreams
Coffee on your campfire
Wind through the barbed wire
Your huddle close to the flame
Though she's far behind you
The night wind reminds you
It just keeps on whispering her name
You can make a run for the border
Try to hide at the hole in the wall
But don't you know your arms are aching to hold her
And cowboy even though your riding tall
Your riding for a fall
Midnight the moon's up
Hands around your tin cup.
Frost settles in on the sage
The nights gettin' colder
Oh man you're getting older
Tonight you're feeling your age
Why don't you turn back
Just saddle up and back track
You know you'll never find a love quite like hers
And on a cold lonesome evening
What the hell good's your freedom
Don't you think it's time you hung up your spurs
You can make a run for the border
Try to hide at the hole in the wall
Don't ya know your arms are aching to hold her
And cowboy even though your riding tall
You're riding for a fall
Cowboy you're riding for a fall <start> How many arms have held you
And hated to let you go
How many How many I wonder
But I really don't want to know
And how many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow
How many How many I wonder
But I really don't want to know
So always make me wonder
And always make me guess
Even if I ask you
Darlin' don't confess
No you just let that remain your secret
Cause darlin' I do love you so
How many How many I wonder
But I really don't want to know <start> I stepped out into the blue felt the wind hit my face
Before my chute opened I felt my heart race
I was fallin'
Nope that's just fallin'
And off the coast of Australia I dove way down deep
For all that I saw of that Great Barrier Reef
It was nothin' compared to you it was nothin'
Chorus
I got lightning in my veins and thunder in my chest
All tangled up with you and tryin' to catch my breath
Been chasing that sensation halfway 'round the world
And lookin' back on what we had
Well I've done it all and I've seen it all
But I can't find a feelin' like that
Well I've wound up in some town in Spain runnin' with the bulls
Tryin' to catch another thrill with a thousand other fools
We were runnin' aw but that's just runnin'
When I started pushin' thirty it started pushin' back
Well how was I to know till now you'd be such a hard act to follow
Nothin' seems to follow
Chorus
It's like flyin' down some back road at midnight
With your eyes closed and the headlights off
Girl I've been searchin' everywhere
Can't find that feelin' anywhere
You're all I want now all I want
It's that lightning in my veins and thunder in my chest
All tangled up with you and tryin' to catch my breath
I been chasing that sensation halfway round the world
And lookin' back on what we had
Well I've done it all and I've seen it all
But I can't find a feelin' like that
That's right I've done it all and I've seen it all
But I can't find a feelin' like that <start> Don't believe a word
You don't believe it
I know what you've heard
I could take it or leave it
I meant it for a minute
Not a second too late
Meant it for a minute
Too weak to wait
You took it like a ticket
You were never meant to take
You know I meant it for a minute
Meant it for a minute
You never took a hint
I never lost a wink of sleep
Don't think I blink the tears back
Every time you walk away
You can snap your fingers   
But you can never count on girls like me
Hearts like yours are crack and break
And it's tickin' like a ticket tape
You know I meant it meant it for a minute
Meant it mean it for a minute
You took it right and left
From time to time I lose myself
Can't help I fell
I've left my marbles
On the shelf to roll away
You can count your blessings anyway you please
Standin' on your feet or on your knees
I'm no sweet meant to be
I only meant it for a minute
You know I meant it meant it for a minute
Meant it meant it for a minute <start> Every time my eyes sing that song
I sing for my
Georgia Georgia
The whole day through
This old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Hey Georgia oh yeah yeah Georgia
And a song of you
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly yeah
Still in peaceful dreams I see
On another road it leads back to you
Hey Georgia I say oh Georgia
No no no peace I find
Just an old sweet song God is this song long
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
Busy road the road leads back to you now
Oh Georgia don't do that had to know well
No peace I find won't you hear me now
It's just an old sweet song I said oh I said that
Keeps Georgia on my mind
On my mind yeah it won't be so
Keeps Georgia on my mind
You know the little girls that are on my mind
Yes it is <start> Well you found your loving soemwhere else now she's let you down
So here you are back crying to me
I hate to say I told you so but that's the way life goes
Sorry bout that sorry as I can be
You say you can't eat or sleep for thinking of me
Well honey I knew all the time that's the way it would be
Can't you se you want no welcome right off of my welcome mat
I'm sorry honey sorry bout that
You stand there ringing my doorbell tellin' me how you've hurt
And you say I don't know what you've been through
I hate to put the dapper on but you ain't coming back
Sorry bout that but I'm not sorry for you
You say you can't eat...
I'm sorry baby sorry bout that <start> Now I'm just a bartender
And I don't like my work
But I don't mind the money at all
I see lots of sad faces
And lots of bad cases
Of folks with their backs to the wall
I need four walls around me to hold my life
To keep me from going astray
And a honkytonk angel to hold me tight
To keep me from slipping away
I can light up your smokes
I can laugh at your jokes
I can watch you fall down on your knees
I can close down this bar
Go and gas up my old car
I can pack up oh Lord and mail in the key
I need four walls around me to hold my life
To keep me from going astray
And a honkytonk angel to hold me tight
To keep me from slipping away
Now the smoke fills the air in this honkytonk bar
And I'm thinking 'bout where I'd rather be
But I burned all my bridges and I sank all ships
Now I'm stranded at the edge of the sea
I still need four walls around me to hold my life
To keep me from going astray
And a honkytonk angel to hold me tight
To keep me from slipping away <start> When I noticed her the first time I was outside running barefoot in the rain
She lived in the house next door her nose was pressed against the window pane
When I looked at her she smiled and showed a place where two teeth used to be
And I heard her ask her mom if she could come outside and play with me
Soon the days of sand and shovels gave way to the mysteries of life
Then I noticed she was changin' and I looked at her through different eyes
We became as one and knew a love without beginning or an end
Everyday I lived with her was like a new day dawning once again
And I've loved her since every doll was Shirley Temple soda pop was still a nickel
Jam was on her fingertips milk was circkled on her lips
After many years our love grew silent and at night I heard her cry
When she left me in the fall I said that it would be our last goodbye
I was man enough to give her everything she needed for a home
In searching for a pefect love I found that I could not give her a child
Now she lives a quiet life and is the mother of a little girl
Everytime I pass her house my thoughts go back into another world
Because I see her little girl her nose is pressed against the window pane
She thinks I'm a lonely man who wants to come inside out of the rain
And I've loved her since... <start> I've had big dreams come true
And I believe in angels
Although I can't see them
They're watching over everything I do
Ain't no easy street around the bend on my road
No pot of gold at the end of my rainbow
But I don't mind 'cause baby I got you
The rain keeps the flowers from dying
He sun lights the world when it shines
The midnight sky has a blanket of stars and the moon
And baby I got you
I can't imagine one day without you in it
Life alone just wouldn't be worth living
Love would be a wish that never came true
Lord knows I've got more than I deserve
But I don't question the prayer that I've had answered
I did something right
'Cause baby I got you
The rain keeps the flowers from dying
He sun lights the world when it shines
The midnight sky has a blanket of stars and the moon
And baby I got you <start> You were not content with me when I was like I used to be
I was too oldfashioned too simple and too plain
And so you took this country girl taught me all about the world
Yes you're the one that taught me how to swing
I used to never drink or smoke I'd even blush at dirty jokes
I never wanted to take part in all those worldly games
But you dressed me up in sexy clothes took me where the swingers go
Yes you're the one that taught me how to swing
But you don't want me swingin' now but you're the one that taught me how
It was you that wanted me to change
I'm only what you made of me your mistake was changin' me
Yes you're the one that taught me how to swing
You want me like I was before but I'm not like that anymore
This plain old simple country girl won't ever be the same
So don't expect me to go back 'cause it's a bit too late for that
And you're the one that taught me how to swing <start> Alabama your beautiful sunlight your fields are so recent potatoes and corn
Alabama your crimson red clover all mingle around the old place I was born
Alabama your hills and your valleys your creeks sing with laughter as onward they flow
Alabama so sweet in the springtime sweet ferns and wild flowers and winter with snow
Alabama so sweet to my mem'ry you shine like a light on a beautiful hill
Alabama in days of my childhood I played there and toiled at the old sawmill
Alabama your beautiful highways across through the mountains where loved ones do wait
Alabama your golden rock flowers and the welcome home sigh hanging over your gate
Alabama to me you are calling my footsteps are hauling no longer to stray
Alabama you're all what I long for you're all what I love so I'm coming today <start> I left you and left you broken hearted I left you and now I can't forget
I thought then that I could live without you forgive me and I'll make you happy yet
Forgive me for all the pain I've caused you forgive me for unkind words I've said
I thought once that I could live without you I'm paying with the broken heart instead
I wish I had never made you blue sweetheart I wish I could live it over now
I know now that I can't live without you forgive me and I'll make it up somehow
Forgive me for all the pain <start> Well I caught my wife with another man
And it cost me  on a prison farm
In Georgia close to the Florida line
Well I've been here for two long years
I finally made the warden my friend
And so he sentenced me to a life of ease
Takin' care of ol' red now ol' red
He's the damnedest dog that I've ever seen
Got a nose that can smell a two day trail
He's a four legged trackin' machine
You can consider yourself mighty lucky
To get past the gators in the quicksand fence
But all these years that I've been here ain't nobody got past red
And the warden sang
Come on somebody why don't you run
Ol' red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern get my gun
Red'll have you treed 'for the mornin' comes
Well I payed off the guard
And I sent out a letter to my cousin up in Tennessee
And he brought down a blue tick hound she was pretty as she could be
Well they pinned her up in the swamplands
'Bout a mile just south of the gate
Well I'd take ol' red for his evenin' runs
I'd just drop him off and wait
And the warden sang
Come on somebody why don't you run
Ol' red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern get my gun
Red'll have you treed 'for the mornin' comes
Now ol' red got real used to seein' his lady every night
So I kept him away for three or four days
And waited 'til the time got right
Well I made my run in the evenin' sun
And I smiled when I heard let red out
'Cause I was headed north to Tennessee and ol' red was headed south
And the warden sang
Come on somebody why don't you run
Ol' red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern get my gun
Red'll have you treed 'for the mornin' comes
Now there's red haired blue ticks
All in the south
Love got me in here
And love got me out <start> I'll hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms
Like you'd never been held before
And I'll think of you each day then I'll dream the night away
Till you are in my arms once more
The stars up in the sky know the reason why I feel so blue when I'm away from you
I'll hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms so darling please wait for me
The stars up in the sky... <start> Twenty seven days I've been out on the road
I'm a nervous wreck I gotta get back home.
There's a young bride waiting for me all alone
Lord how she misses me.
I can see her sittin' in the kitchen chair
In a cotton dress with her long black hair.
But a woman ain't pretty if a man ain't there
That I can't afford to be.
It's a shame it's a shame
She won't be the one to blame
Oh the hurtinest thing in the whole wide world
Is the heart of a lonely girl.
Like a redtail fox to a blue tick hound
She's the hottest thing for miles around.
All them other boys in our hometown
Got tricks hid up their sleeves.
Now it ain't her that I don't trust
She's pretty and pure as diamond dust.
But lonesome is this lonesome girl
She can't help for what she needs.
It's a shame it's a shame
She won't be the one to blame
Oh the hurtinest thing in the whole wide world
Is the heart of a lonely girl.
The heart of a lonely girl
The heart of a lonely girl.
It's the hurtinest thing in the whole wide world
The heart of a lonely girl.
Daddy was a rambler just like me
I guess the apple don't fall too far from the tree.
When I ask why momma had to go that day
Well he don't know and she won't say.
It's a shame it's a shame
She won't be the one to blame
Oh the hurtinest thing in the whole wide world
Is the heart of a lonely girl.
Yeah it's a shame it's a shame
She won't be the one to blame
Yeah the hurtinest thing in the whole wide world
Is the heart of a lonely girl.
Yeah the hurtinest thing in the whole wide world
Is the heart of a lonely girl. <start> Love unending love undying love that never grows cold
Love that never leaves you crying love that never grows old
That's what I'd give to you if you say that you love me too
That's what I'd give to you all the days of my life
Love for loving love for living love that has no pride
Love that's tender and forgiving soft and warm inside
That's what I'd give to you...
I'd give you everything that's mine to give
I'd give you more than this a reason to live
Love unending love undying...
All the days of my life all the days of my life <start> Misery and gin
Here I am drunk again
And gone gone gone
Man I hate these songs
Silver wings
And old lonesome memory
The music plays on
I hate these songs
Chorus
Cause I sit in my car
And I bathe in their sorrow
Try to wash away my pain
Just to get through tomorrow
Note by note
Line by line
It cuts to the bone
Man I hate these songs
Crazy four walls
He stopped loving her today
And old lonely street
Ain't it funny how time slips away
And born to loose
Am I losing you
I'm just hanging on
Man I hate these songs
Chorus
The music plays on
Man I hate these songs <start> Staring out my window who is that I see
He sure does look familiar and he's wearing boots and jeans
Can't tell you were I saw him was it on a late night screen
A cowboy in this city's something I ain't never seen
He's knockin' on the door of my two two room flat
Do I let him in what I would give to love a man like that
Chorus
He walks that western walk he talks that southern talk
He rides the rodeo he comes from San Antonio
He's drivin' a big ole Cadillac
Hey I could love a man like that
Yes I could love a man like that
He takes me by the hand as he leads me out the door
I say GoodBye ole city I won't be back here no more
Well I moved here from the country thought I'd try and get ahead
Oh but every road I've taken's headed other ways instead
But I've packed up my belongings and he's handing me the keys
I'm headed to the Mountains with the man of my dreams
Chorus
Now you may think I'm crazy but I just can't explain
There's something about a cowboy that drives this girl insane
Chorus <start> Fly fly away fly away in the morning
Fly fly away just don't give me no warning
Go on girl fly away
If that's what you want to do
'Cause whatever's left to say girl
It won't come from me and you
So fly fly away fly away in the morning
Fly fly away just don't give me no warning
I guess everything's been done
But if there's nothing here for you
If you want to chase the sun girl
Well that's just what you ought to do <start> A man can be happy without money but he must have some love in his life
I've lost you and now I'm so lonely lonely cause no love have I
I'd trade my life for a beggar if he had someone close by his side
Sometimes I can't keep from crying crying cause no love have I
I know that I must keep on living but it's so hard to hold my hand high
My worldly possessions mean nothing nothing cause no love have I
I hope you'll be happy in your world I've wondered since we've said goodbye
I've prayed that you'll always have someone and never say no love have I <start> Took the Continental Trailways
'Cause I didn't have the fare
To get from Cincinnati to Los Angeles by air
The guy who said he'd meet me
In a shiny limousine
With a contract in his pocket
Turned out to be a queen
He could not see my body
Or appreciate my good looks
Had I fallen for some story
That I read in all of the books
But I ain't
Goin' back
To the bottom side of the tracks
No No and I ain't
Goin' back
To the bottom side of the tracks
No I ain't goin' back
To Cincinnati
So I got myself an agent
With a roll of dollar bills
And a Beverly type mansion
In the middle of the hills
I was friendly with producers
And was heading out with the stars
I played the backseat heroine
In a thousand different cars
From Cavalier to Playboy
To the Johnny Carson show
To holding up some dogfood
For a firm in Idaho
I've a screentest every weekend
And I'm constantly on call
I'll be twentyfive next summer
And thirtyfive next fall
But I ain't
Goin' back
To the bottom side of the track
No No and I ain't
Goin' back
To the bottom side of the track
You'll never get me to go back
Ain't goin' back
To Cincinnati <start> Today I passed you on the street and my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
 guitar  steel 
It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you and hold you just the way I used to do
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you I can't help it if I'm still in love with you <start> I used to sing to her
It used to make her smile
She knew all the words
For a while
I sang love me tender
Always and forever
Hold me baby all night long
I could go on and on
But that's another song
We used to go for walks
On a country road like this
It's funny all the small
Things you miss
Like puttin' pennies on a train track
The way you brushed your hair back
The sun on your face
I wish I were there today
But that's another place
Oh the way I used to hold her
The things I should've told her
If I could make the clock unwind
Back to when she was mine
But that's another time
Oh the way I used to hold her
The things I should've told her
If I could make the clock unwind
Back to when she was mine
But that's another time
I could go on and on and on
But that's another song <start> Happiness happiness the greatest gift that I posses
I thank the Lord I've been blessed with more than my share of happiness
To me this old world is a wonderful place
And I'm just about the luckiest human in the whole human race
I've got no silver and I've got no gold just a whole lot of happiness in my soul
Happiness happiness...
Happiness to me is an ocean tide or a sunset fading on a mountain side
Or maybe a big old heaven full of stars up above
When I'm in the arms of the one I love
Happiness is a field of grain lifting its face to the falling rain
I can see it in the sunshine I breathe it in the rain happiness everywhere
Happiness happiness...
A wise old man told me one time that happiness is nothing but a frame of mind
I hope when you go to measuring my success
That you don't count my money count my happiness
Happiness happiness...
Happiness happiness... <start> I don't care if I'm not the first love you've known just so I'll be the last
No I don't care if I'm not the first one you'd kissed darling I'll never ask
Yesterday's gone love me from now on be true to me forget about the past
'Cause I don't care if I'm not the first love you've known just so I'll be the last
Yesterday's gone love me from now on...
Just so I'll be the last <start> I dreamed that the great judgment morning
had dawned and the trumpets had blown.
I dreamed that all nations had gathered
to judgment before the white thrown.
From the thrown came a bright shining angel
and stood on the land and the sea.
And swore with his hand raised toward heaven
that time was no longer to be.
And oh what a weeping and wailing
as the lost were told of their fate.
They cried for the rocks and the mountains
they prayed but their prayers were too late.
Oh the rich man was there but his money
had melted and vanished away.
A pauper he stood in the judgment
his debts were to heavy to pay.
Now the great man was there but his greatness
when death came was left far behind.
The angels that opened all the records
not a trace of his greatness could find.
The widow was there with the orphans
God heard and remembered their cry.
No sorrow in heaven forever.
Oh God wiped all their tears from their eyes.
The gambler was there and the drunkard.
And the men that had sold them the drink
with the peope who gave them the license
all together in hell they did sink.
The moral man came to the judgment
but his selfrighteous rags would not do.
The men who had crucified jesus
had passed off as moral men too.
The soul that had put off salvation
Not tonight I'll get saved by and by.
No time now to think of religion.
At last they had found time to die.
And oh what a weeping and wailing
as the lost they were told of there faith.
They cried for the rocks and the mountains
oh they prayed but their prayers were too late.
They prayed but their prayers was too late. <start> If I could see you just one time
Oh how it'd ease my troubled mind
If I could just hold you one more time
And then pretend that you're still mine
Lips that used to thrill me so
They now thrill someone else I know
Gone is the love that once was mine
Wish I could see you just one time
Oh oh oh how I miss you so
Oh I need you so
I'd give this heart of mine
If I could see you just one time
Wish I could relive just one time
Turn back the pages and there I'd find
That same old love that once was mine
Wish I could see you just one time
Oh oh oh how I miss you so
Oh I need you so
I'd give this heart of mine
If I could see you just one time
Oh oh oh how I miss you so
Oh I need you so
I'd give this heart of mine
If I could see you just one time
Oh oh oh how I miss you so
Oh I need you so
I'd give this heart of mine
If I could see you just one time
If I could see you just one time
Wish I could see you one more time <start> We don't always hear the end when it knocks on the door
lets you know what's coming there and then
you could slip in the dark
find your way under my skin
you and your band of demons just move right in
and you come to stay and you find your way into every breath I breath.
but I fought you and I beat you before you got to deep.
I know there will be more of you bound to come along
so I thank my lucky star to say we are through and pray you stay gone
you get away with murder
you still sanity from the sane
you rock the lives of moms and dads and children all the same
and you never face your trials or you would be somewhere doing time.
and the end of days and kingdom come not a soul would ever mind
but you come to stay and you find your way into every breath I breath. But I fought you and I beat you before you got to deep. I there will be more of you bound to come along so I thank <start> I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow
Norman Blake
I am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my day.
I bid farewell to old Kentucky
The place where I was born and raised.

For six long years I've been in trouble
No pleasures here on earth I found
For in this world I'm bound to ramble
I have no friends to help me now.
 He has no friends to help him now
It's fare thee well my old true lover
I never expect to see you again
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad
Perhaps I'll die upon this train.
 Perhaps he'll die upon this train.
You can bury me in some deep valley
For many years where I may lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave.
 While he is sleeping in his grave.
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
My face you'll never see no more.
But there is one promise that is given
I'll meet you on God's golden shore.
 He'll meet you on God's golden shore. <start> You got the right string baby but the wrong yoyo
Somebody's knockin' on your door
I passed this morning by the hardware store
Bought a brand new string for my yoyo
Walked down the doctors' get the string put on
He made mistake put the string on wrong
No need for knockin' on nobody's door
Bought the right string baby for the wrong yoyo
Mama told me and Papa did too
Some of these women are going to be the death of you
Better find out wait till you crave
Some of these women'll take you to our grave
When you see me coming put your man outdoors
I ain't no stranger I've been here before
No need for knockin' on nobody's door
I got the right string baby but the wrong yoyo
Right string baby but the wrong yoyo
Somebody's knockin' on your door
I passed this morning by the hardware store
Bought a brand new string for my yoyo
Walked down the doctors' get the string put on
He made a mistake put the string on wrong
No need for knockin' on nobody's door
I got the right string baby but the wrong yoyo <start> Rock hard love what you gave me rock hard love sweet and tough
Lifted me when I was sinking with your sweet rock hard love
Lost and lonely on life's highway drifting farther out to sea
Like a lighthouse on the seashore your sweet love shines out to me
Rock hard love...
When the storms of life are blowing and no sunshine can be seen
When there's nothing left but darkness your rock hard love lays next to me
Oh you told me that you loved me and you proved it every way
Stood beside me then to guide me rock hard love everyday
Rock hard love...
Lifted me when I was sinking with your sweet rock hard love <start> Another day break wakes me up to a hotel lobby coffee cup
That dirty old white pickup truck with the trailer hooked up by the Denny's she's mine
Last night's bugs on the windshield fast food trash on the dash meal
Speedin' ticket and a doctor bill from a gash I got from a short go in Casper
Summer of last year maybe next year
And a ride and a fall one day I might win 'em all
Just some broken hearts and broken bones and a hell of a whole lot of bein' alone
But a right and a wrong where I hang my hat is home
This cowboy life might kill me but it's the only one I know
Cell phone was breakin' up the night she called to say she'd had enough
Of my little white lies and little white lines and wantin' somebody who could never be with her
I look back on every fork in the road that I took to chase that buckle of gold
And wonder if what I held for what I hold is worth tradin' away
Hell I don't know all I know
Is a ride and a fall one day I might win 'em all
Just some broken hearts and broken bones and a hell of a whole lot of bein' alone
But a right and a wrong where I hang my hat is home
This cowboy life might kill me but it's the only one I know
Yeah it'll kill me before it ever lets me go
It'll kill me but it's the only life I know
And I'd rather die than be caught cryin'
So I'm just smilin' wear my hat down low
Wear my hat down low
And a ride and a fall one day I might win 'em all
Just some broken hearts and broken bones and a hell of a whole lot of bein' alone
But a right and a wrong where I hang my hat is home
This cowboy life might kill me but it's the only one I know
Yeah this cowboy life might kill me but it's the only one I know <start> I throwed and I throwed that old rope
At that makebelieve steer
I'd never been so frustrated
In all my nine years
I was about to give up on that old bail of hay
When from the front porch I heard my Dad say
Chorus
My little cowboy
You make me so proud boy
Don't give up now
Cause I know that somehow
You'll figure it out
My little cowboy
I played and I played this old bar
Trying to make the big time
I stayed broke which was cool
Until along came a kid and a wife
That's when I called up my Dad I said today is the day
It's time to put this old guitar away... and he said
Chorus
Hold on there cowboy
You make me so proud boy
Don't give up now
'Cause I know that somehow
Youll figure it out
Yeah my little cowboy yeah
Now I've got a boy of my own
With his own set of dreams
He works hard to play quarterback
For his peewee league team
A blue star on his helmet our last name on his back
Three downs in a row all end with a sack... and I hollered out
Chorus
That's my little cowboy
You make me so proud boy
Don't give up now
'Cause I know that somehow
You'll throw that touchdown
Oh my little cowboy
My little cowboy <start> I wonder should I tell you
'Bout all the crazy things I've ever done
I've been searching all my life
And when I should have stayed I tried to run
I was searching for an answer
In a world full of strangers
But what I found was never real enough
Now that I've found you
I'm looking in the eyes of love
Darlin' you've been good to me
You are so much more than I deserve
I never thought that I would find
Someone who's so sweet and kind like you
Please believe me when I say
This time I won't run away
I swear by all of heaven's stars above
Now that I've found you
I'm looking in the eyes of love
Looking in the eyes of love I can see forever
I can see you and me walking in this old world together
Lord my heart's found a home I've been dreaming of
Now that I've found you I'm looking in the eyes of love
Looking in the eyes of love I can see forever
I can see you and me walking in this old world together
Lord my heart's found a home I've been dreaming of
Now that I've found you I'm looking in the eyes of love <start> I guess I'm just the fool they call me
For loving you the way I do.
But I would rather be a fool dear
Than be so lonely without you.
Chorus
They tell me that a fool can't miss love.
They tell me that a fool don't know.
But if I had to live without you
I'd rather be a fool than go.
I guess I'll stay the fool they call me
For without you there's nothing left.
But I would rather be a fool love
Than be so lonely by myself.
Chorus <start> Braided rope saddle soap rosin for his riggin'
A young man dreams of growing up to ride
Buckin' broncs Brahma bulls is just some wishful thinkin'
Cause that cowboy well he's still too young to ride
Leather chaps a big white hat silver spurs that glisten
Growin' up takes such a long long time
And he could ride the rankest bronc if only they would listen
How that cowboy's dreams sound a lot like mine
Dream on cowboy your trophy buckles're waitin'
You got the world by the reins and you've got time on your side
Dream on cowboy there's not a thing in your way now
So don't wait 'til it's too late to saddle your dreams and ride
 guitar 
The time has past and looking back the rodeo has ended
The cowboys and the fans have all gone home
But broken hearts and broken bones and time will all be mended
But the mem'ries of this cowboy's life live on
Dream on cowboy... <start> Just about the time I pull myself together
When the hurt in me gets better than it's been
Just about the time I feel life's still worth living it's funny here comes honey again
Honey comes and honey stays just long enough to tear my mind up
Then she leaves me just the way I knew she would
And I have to start all over start to picking up the pieces
Times like this I almost wish she'd go for good
Just about the time I'd find myself a new love
When this broken heart she left me starts to mend
Then that's just about the time that I'll be saying it's funny here comes honey again
 steel 
Just about the time I feel life's till worth living
It's funny here comes honey again it's funny here comes honey again <start> Darlin' I'm cashing my chips at the bar
'Cause I've got no money to my name
And you've gone and left me
With this ragged old car
And now I'm learning to forgive my heart
Chorus 
'Cause my heart is the one to blame
The one who put me
Through this heartache and shame
The one who tore me apart
Now I'm learning to forgive my heart.
Now I'm out here wasting my money on gin
And I'm gonna make a toast to my heart
And all of the barflies are cashing it in
They're also learning to forgive their hearts.
Chorus
The one who tore me apart
Now I'm learning to forgive my heart. <start> My baby dreams while he's awake
He slips down city streets
His soles are worn so that he skates
While he's walking
My baby laughs while he's asleep
Too hot to worry
He kicks the covers with his feet
While he's laughing
Dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
My baby's eyes are open
But he can't see what I'm showing him
Not turquoise like a swimming pool
But calm and gray like morning
Dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
The right side
My baby baby's man enough
To reach and touch a heart that's beating
Violet falls across the land
The sun's gone down it's evening
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
The right side
The right side
The right side <start> 
Tonight all is quiet in Mission Chapel
And the music like his love has died away
And I'm standing in the middle of these memories
Mission Chapel memories of our wedding day
I see the rice still scattered all around
That veil upon my satin wedding gown
And the wedding bells that rang are silent now
Only Mission Chapel memories all around
Tonight I'm all alone at Mission Chapel
And I'm thinking of my love so far away
While I'm standing in the middle of all these memories
Mission Chapel memories of our wedding day
I see the rice still scattered all around
That veil upon my satin wedding gown
The gown I wore when I became his bride
And now these Mission Chapel memories fill my eyes
As these Mission Chapel memories fill my eyes <start> Three fingers whiskey pleasures a drinker
But moving does more than that drinking for me
Willy he tells me that doers and thinkers say moving's the closest thing to being free
He rosined his riggin he laid back his wages he's dead cert on ridin' the big rodeos
My woman's tight with an overdue baby and Willy keeps yelling hey big boy let's go
Willy you're wild as a Texas Blue Norther ready rolled from the same makins as me
And I reckon we'll ramble till hell freeze us over Willy the wandering Gypsy and me
Ladies we surely will take up your pleasures
But I've got to worn you there never will be
A single soul living can put brand or handle on Willy the wandering Gypsy and me
Well they dance on the mountains and they shout in the canyons
They swarm it ain't loose herd like the wild buffalos
Jammin' our heads full of figures and angles and tellin' us stuff that we already know
Willy you're wild as a Texas Blue Norther...
I reckon we'll ramble till hell freeze us over Willy the wandering Gypsy and me <start> After all these years runnin' round
Flyin' high and fallin' down
Well the time has come at last
To rest my heart and ease my past
I'm gonna leave these blues behind
For some other fool to find
He won't care and I don't mind
Hide me babe hide me babe
Darlin' don't you cry tonight
The moon is full and the world is right
I've loved more than my share
Took the pain and called it fair
So I'm gonna lay down all my fears
My highway blues and my ramblin' tears
They can shout it down the line
I can't take what was not mine
I'll raise my glass and I'll make a toast
Better than some harder than most
Left our mark on every town
Chased our dreams and we stood our ground
But I can't do those things no more
Hide the way I've done before
The same wings that brought me through
Blow that fate and flame out too
After all these years runnin' round
Flyin' high and fallin' down
Well the time has come at last
To rest my heart and ease my past
I'm gonna leave these blues behind
For some other fool to find
He won't care and I don't mind
Hide me babe hide me babe <start> Just left her alone with an empty wound
Beautiful house full of empty rooms
His breath is behind everything
Left her feeling nothing
Her eyes still dry her hands don't shake
Days roll by but her heart won't break
She wishes it would she'd float away and fly
She wishes it would she'd float away and fly
She picks up the paper
But the words are blurred
And she thinks about writing
Down the way that they were
Just left her with everything
She feels like being nothing
Her eyes stay dry days still break
Years go by her heart won't ache
She knows what it should
She'd float away and fly
And how do we get it
What we need to get it
How can she feel for what's real
The story she told us
Unfolded in on itself
Is there a hurt that can heal
Is it sore hidden and sore it's as dark in this moment
As the day she are was born
All hidden and sore it's dark as when it's over
As the day we are born
Her eyes won't cry and her hands don't shake
The years roll by her heart won't break
And she wishes it would she'd float away and fly
And she wishes it would she'd float away and fly
And she wishes it would she'd float away
Just left her alone with an empty wound
Beautiful house full of empty rooms <start> Today my life is so much brighter and I know how love will always shine
Each day my heart is so much lighter and it's all because you are mine
You give me love and true devotion and all the little things so sweet and fine
I owe the world but yet I own it and it's all because you are mine
If love could be heaven I know I'll find mine
To try to live without you would be a waste of time
You give me love and true devotion...
And it's all because you are mine <start> Writer Dolly Parton

When your eyes meet mine my heart beats out of time
And I burn with desire through and through
I can't help myself I can't see no one else cause my eyes can only see you
My eyes can only see you my eyes can only see you
Your face is always in view for my eyes can only see you
I want you so much and I long for your touch and your eyes tell me you want me
too
Oh it may not be right but I'm too weak to fight and my eyes can only see you
My eyes can only see you...
And my eyes can only see you <start> I used to cry over you
I lost my heart and there was nothin' I could do
I couldn't smile when you would leave
If you were mad I couldn't find the strength to breathe
I used to pine for what we had
I woke up hurtin' in my heart for you so bad
A stronger love had never been
I used to miss you and all the times we spent
Not anymore not now you tore my heart out
Gave me up and brought me down
You set me free walked out the door
I used to need you to be happy not anymore
Time heals everything
You almost killed me when you left and now I sing
I think of you now and then
But you'll never get the chance to break my heart again <start> Ramblin' rose ramblin' rose why you ramble no one knows
Wild and wind blown that's how you've grown who can cling to a ramblin' rose
Ramble on ramble on when you're ramblin' days are gone
Who will love you with a love true when you're ramblin' days are gone
Ramblin' rose ramblin' rose why I want you heaven knows
Though I love you with a love true but who can cling to a ramblin' rose
Ramblin' rose ramblin' rose why I want you heaven knows
Though I love you with a love true but who can cling to a ramblin' rose <start> Blue eyed Susans standing in a domino line
Falling in and out of love all the time
They'll break your heart just to see a boy cry
ah but not me
I am a brown eyed loner I march to my own drummer
I'm a piccolo owner and the labor of my mother's love
Honey you'd be a load off her mind
But with or without you
My only plan is to be free
With or without you
I'm still me
Ah
I'll join a band and sing like a canary
Get out of here and change my name to Cherry
And every night I'll thank holy Mother Mary
I am a keeper
Oh I am a keeper baby
I am a keeper
Long stem roses standing in a vase by my bed
Standing tall like the dreams in my head
I'm not gonna live in this house 'til I'm dead
I like you a lot 'cause you're different a little
You got answers to my riddles
Your daddy is a pistol and you are a son of a gun
I could be the daughter that he never wanted
But with or without you I'll buy a farm at the edge of the prairie
Live off the land and change my name to Cherry
And every night I'll thank holy Mother Mary
I am a keeper ah I am a keeper baby
I am a keeper
With or without you my only plan is to be free
With or without you
Bye babe
I'll buy a sword and join the military
Cut my hair and change my name to Cherry
And every night I'll thank holy Mother Mary
I am a keeper ah I am a keeper baby
I am a keeper oh I am a keeper baby
I'm not one of those blue eyed Susans
Ha ah I'm doing my own thing
I am a keeper
I am a keeper baby
I am a keeper
I am a keeper baby
I am a keeper
I am a keeper baby <start> Thank you baby for teaching me the world is really round
There's more to it than my two eyes can see
Thank you baby for showing me that black is sometimes grey
And the alphabet is more than ABC
Thanks for explaining that there are things the best left unexplain
But thanks for tryin' hard to answer all my questions just the same
Thanks for thinking that much of me
But most of all baby thanks for tryin' so hard to love me
Thank you baby for never promising thanks you couldn't give
For never lie just make yourself look good
Thank you baby for never pushing me down the path I shouldn't go
And with all my fate and trust you know you could
Thanks for opening my eyes things I couldn't know
Wrapped in my for I had all those seeds to grow
Thanks for thinking that much of me
But most of all baby thanks for tryin' so hard to love me
Thank you baby I wanna thank you baby <start> Drop Kick Me Jesus

End over end neither left nor to right
Straight through the heart of them righteous uprights
Drop kick me Jesus through the goal posts of life
Make me oh make me Lord more than I am
Make me a piece in your master game plan
Free from the earthly temptations below

Bring on the brothers whoEve gone on before
And all of the sisters whoEve knocked on your door
All the departed dear loved ones of mine
Stick them up front in the offensive line

Oh drop kick me Jesus through the goal posts of life <start> Please release me let me go
'Cause I don't love you anymore
And to waste our lives would be a sin
Release and let me love again

And I will always want him near
His lips are warm while yours are cold
Release me my darling let me go
Please release me let me go
No I don't love you anymore
To waste our lives would be a sin
So release and let me love again
Please release me can't you see
That you'd be a fool to cling to me
And to live together is a sin
So release and let me love again <start> You would think I was born yesterday the way I act sometimes
Like I'd never heard your good message deaf dumb and blind
Speak harsh to my children impatient with my lover
And that man on the street he cut me off in traffic
You should've heard me scream
And just when I think I've pushed it too far
Worried about the battle and blowing the war
That's when I hear your voice in my ear with
Love so simple love so plain
Coming down on me like the rain
With sweet forgiveness no matter what I do
And it makes me want to get just a little bit closer to you
'Cause Lord I carry these demons temptation ooh I've had my fun
But lately I've been thinking there's work to be done
I know how to be gentle it's just that I forget
If someone makes me angry someone's in a hurry
I can just let them just rush on by and take that deeper breath
Because this is the battle yeah this is the war
This is really worth fighting for
And I have no fear as long as you are near with
Love so simple love so plain
Coming down on me like the rain
With sweet forgiveness no matter what I do
And it makes me want to get just a little bit closer to you
These things I say and do I wish that you did not see
I'm thanking you now for never giving up on me with
Love so simple love so plain
Coming down on all of us like the rain
With sweet forgiveness no matter what we do
And it makes me want to get just a little bit closer to you ooh closer <start> I've been foolish and blind
Time after time girl I've let you down.
And I'm losing my mind
Tryin' to find a way to show you now
That you are all I want.
You are all I want.
Girl I'm down on my knees
Begging you please I need another chance.
But you're not looking at me
Are you hearing my plea
Won't you take my hand

'Cause Ruby you're all that I want
My heart and my treasure.
Ruby you're all that I need
For now and forever.
You are all I want.
You are all I want.
I know that talk is cheap
And words seem weak
Coming from this broken man.
Still I will speak 'cause I can't sleep
Until you truly understand.

Don't want diamonds or gold
When I've got my ruby to hold.
You know I'm in ecstasy
I cant ever get enough.
Don't want platinum or pearls
I'd trade all the jewels in the world
Just to have you next to me.
I can't live Without your love no...

You are all I want. <start> THIS LITTLE LIGHT OF MINE
Traditional
Chorus
This little light of mine
I'm going to let it shine.
This little light of mine
I'm going to let it shine.
This little light of mine
I'm going to let it shine
Every day every day
Every day every day
Gonna let my little light shine.
On Monday he gave me the gift of love
On Tuesday peace came from above.
On Wednesday told me to have more faith
On Thursday gave me a little more grace.
On Friday told me to watch and pray
On Saturday told me just what to say
On Sunday gave power divine
Just to let my little light shine. 
Chorus
Now some say you got to run and hide.
But we say there's no place to hide.
And some say let others decide
But we say let the people decide.
Some say the time's not right
But we say the time's just right.
If there's a dark corner in our land
You got to let your little light shine. 
Chorus <start> Writers Doug SupernawKenny King
I just called to say hello I hope everything's alright
Me I'm doin' fine but I still can't sleep at night
I finally had a good day just last week
At least the best one since you've gone
But it kills me when I hear When's Mamma comin' home
Chorus
And I know that there are somethings
You feel that you've been missing
I tried to be your Superman
I've done all I can
Still you feel the need to spread your wings
But darlin' if you're listening
When the world ain't all you thought it would be
You still got me
I live everyday a lie and tell the kids that it's alright
And I see alot of you in them when I tuck'em in at night
Try hard not to be too weak for one of us must be strong
And it kills me when I'm there lyin' all alone <start> Now I'm drifting into deep water I'm starting to care for you.
You're getting me in deep water be careful what you do.
Now you want a romance but I'm seeking love I know I was ready when it ends
'cause I'm winding up in deep water why can't we just be friends
Now it's restless in this deep water I'm off between right and wrong.
And my love is true as deep water your love won't last as long.
Now where will it lead me and where will it end I can't help but wish I only knew
'cause I'm winding up in deep water so deep in love with you. <start> That alarm sounds without warning
I wake up and say good morning
And I love you
I know sometimes you're still sleeping
I still whisper babe I'm leaving
And I love you
You need to know this ain't some kind of sometimes thing
This is something I will always do
Yeah the sun shines the river winds and the bluebirds sing
And I love you
While I work I curse the boss
And I anticipate gettin' off
And I love you
Oh and there's a little place
Where everybody goes at  o'clock
But I drive straight home
'Cause I love youhoney
Ohyou need to know this ain't some kind of sometimes thing
It's something I will always do
Yeah the sun shines the river winds and the bluebirds sing
And I love you
Ohyou need to know this ain't some kind of sometimes thing
It's something I wait always do
Yeah the sun shines the river winds and the bluebirds sing
And I love you
OhI love you
Me holdin' you and you holdin' me
Every night I fall asleep
And I love you
YeahI love you
YeahI love you
I love you <start> I dreamed mama walked up the heavenly stairs
And medals for mothers were given up there
They mentioned the million things mom did for me
Things I took for granted and never could see
If there's medals for mothers
For all of the deeds they have done
If there's medals for mothers
Mama you'll win everyone
A medal of honor was pinned on her
There a medal for patience and kind loving care
A medal for duty she won up above
But the biggest of all was the one for her love
If there's medals unverified
Mama you'll win everyone <start> Today the air cleared up
The lights came on bright
Years of heavy weight
In a moment turned light
I'd thought love could only look dark
As if through a glass
I just turned into an open book
Readin' easy at last
Tonight my walls came down like
A brick through a plate glass window
With a wrecking ball sound like old Jericho
Laid swift to the ground I'm not sure when
But baby you're how the walls came down
I've never trusted much
Got my reasons like most
Stayed well protected from
Every thorn on each rose
Taking those wayward trips
Only to turn back and run
Sailing all my relationships
Could not have dreamed up this one
Tonight my walls came down
You make sense to me in a world where
Just a few things do make sense to me
In your heart I'll put my trust
Through whatever is in front of us
Tonight my walls came down
Ooh baby you're how the walls came down
Oh baby you're how the walls came down <start> I'll be dropping out of sight for awhile I'll be crying and crying's not my style
If they ask you how I took it say I smiled but I'll be dropping out of sight for awhile
This town can do without me for a laughing stock
Since she's gone I'm in a funny state of shock
And I'm so troubled I could walk a thousand miles
So I'll be dropping out of sight for awhile
If you don't see me living like I did you'll know the coward in me went and hid
Before this same old circle drives me wild I'll be dropping out of sight for awhile
Yes I'll be dropping out of sight for awhile <start> FLOWERS FOR MAMA
WRITERS EDDIE NOACK CINDY WALKER AL RUMLEY
Papa brought flowers for mama today
And all the grown children but it's not mother's day
I don't have no money not even a dime
But I brought mama flowers like I have all the time.
Everyday I pick flowers from this pretty hill
A small box of Daisies and a few Daffodils
I bring them to mama at the end of the day
And say flowers for mama here's mama's bouquet.
They brighten her face and she holds me close
She'd say they are more precious than a beautiful rose
And she wore a smile sweeter than millions of flowers
A smile that I'll carry through life's darkest hours.
Spoken
Now mama was lying there yes they tell me she passed away
And she was surrounded by flowers that outshined my bouquet
I know mine aren't fancy but still all the while
They were placed in her hand and I know I saw mama smile.
Sang
Flowers for mama I picked them today
Not very much just a simple bouquet
Mom wasn't so fancy but up there above
She's the prettiest flower in God's garden of love. <start> Wait for the sunshine wait for the sunshine wait for the clouds to roll away
Maybe tomorrow gone will be sorrow wait for the sunshine to bring a brighter day
 dobro 
If sorrow and trouble you're seeing double black clouds surround you all the time
Well don't let misfortune be too discouraging remember tomorrow the sun will shine
Wait for the sunshine...
 harmonica 
If it seems forever since there's been laughter don't let old misery get you down
Just keep your chin up don't ever give up tomorrow the sunshine may come around
Wait for the sunshine... <start> I don't know why I love women
That love to do me wrong
I don't know why my life sounds like
A heart broke country song
I ain't really happy
Unless the sky starts driving rain
Maybe I just get off on the pain
And my whole life I been picking fights
There ain't no way to win
There's a hundred scars I should have run away
Now tattooed on my skin
There's a side of me that just won't stop
Dancin' in the flame
Maybe I just get off on the pain
'Cause I love the long shot
And the left out lost causes
And hanging out in the back of the pack with the dark horses
I ride the wrong road just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain
I wake up every morning a thousand miles from home
Praying for forgiveness
For this aching in my bones
It would be so easy
To find a better way
Oh but I know I'll never change
'Cause I love the long shot
And the left out lost causes
Hanging out in the back of the pack with the dark horses
I ride the wrong road just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain
'Cause I love the long shot
And the left out lost causes
Hanging out in the back of the pack with the dark horses
I ride the wrong road just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
I know I'm the only one to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain <start> Well this big city life is gettin' me down
There's just too many people around
There's dirt in the air and crime in the street
Highrise buildings and cold concrete
This rat race sure enough takes a toll
I want to run off to my fishin' hole
Take me back take me back
Take me back to the country
Take me back take me back
Take me back to the country
Where the stars at night
Outshine those city lights
Take me back to the country
Where the eagles fly
And the treetops touch the sky
Take me back to the country
This traffic jam is makin' me mad
I miss the simple life I had
Peace and quite runnin' free
I want to go home to my family
I'm sick of the clock sick of the phone
Out in the country my time's my own
Take me back take me back
Take me back to the country
Take me back take me back
Take me back to the country
Where the stars at night
Outshine those city lights
Take me back to the country
Where the eagles fly
And the treetops touch the sky
Take me back to the country <start> Oh the games people play now
Every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say now
Never saying what they mean.
They just wile away the hours
In their ivory towers
Til they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine.
La da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da dee
I'm talking bout you and me
And the games people play.
Oh we make one another cry
Break our heart when we say goodbye
Cross our hearts and we hope to die
Bet the other was to blame.
Neither one ever give an inch
So we gaze at our eight by ten
Thinking bout the things that might of been
And its a dirty rotten shame.

People walking up to you
Singing glory Hallelujah
And their trying to sock it to you
In the name of the Lord.

Read your horoscope and cheat your fate
And to furthermore to hell with hate

La da da da da da da da

Well look around and tell me what you see
What's a happening to you and me

For your pride and your vanity
Turns you back on humanity
And you don't give a da da.

How time can alter any plan then gently lead you to know
Truth hopes lies will never show
Oh that love only pauses for a while and is always free to go
Honey I learned not to seek
Any promise hearts must keep after mine had come to know
And disappointedly so
That love only pauses for a while and is always free to go
At every fading glance I reach to take it in my hands
As if that touch might be the one last chance
And though all those distant dreams
Seldom turn out what they seem in the rush to let them grow
Their loss had taught me to know
That love only pauses for a while and is always free to go
At every fading glance I reach to take it in my hands
As if that touch might be the one last chance
Baby now I understand
How time can alter any plan then gently lead you to know
Truth hopes lies will never show
That love only pauses for a while and is always free to go
Yeah love only pauses for a while and is always free to go <start> If I could be there
I'd be there tonight comforting you
This road I'm on is so far away
Too far away
If God would grant me wings to fly
I'd be in your arms by and by
If I could be there
I'd be there tonight comforting you
If I could be there
I'd look in your eyes and say I love you
These hills and highways
Between us now keep us apart
If God would grant me wings to fly
I'd be in your arms by and by
If I could be there
I'd look in your eyes and say I love you
If I could be there
I wouldn't have this pain in my heart
Tomorrow I'll wake up with joy for the day
Joy for the day
If God would grant me wings to fly
I'd be in your arms by and by
If I could be there
I wouldn't have this pain in my heart
If I could be there <start> 
One cold black night of a Colorado winter
It snowed on Red Mountain Pass
We warned ev'rybody that the Slide was runnin'
An' Oh was a mess
But outta the plowshed south a' town
Come a blade with a flashin' blue light
We told that boy Whatever you do
Beware of the Riverslide Slide.
Now that plowjockey knew he had a job to do
Been dodgin' them slides for years
But we all knew deep down inside
He was livin' with a thing called fear
'Cause you don't mess around with an avalanche son
A lotta men tried and died
Yeah you get them plows past Bear Creek Falls
You lookin' at the Riverside Slide
Now all a' us folks around Ouray County
Seen a lotta them cold black nights
When the only thing movin' is a big ol' plow
Flashin' them weird blue lights
You drive them snowplows around these parts
You gotta have a real thick hide
'Cause ya never quite know what time a' the night
You gonna die in the Riverside Slide
Well it snowed six feet on the mountain that night
An' we knew what was comin' on down
An' so did the boy an' his flashin' blue light
When he rolled that blade outta town
Well he took that plow up Oh
An' he felt it lean to one side
An' before he knew it he was buried alive
At the bottom of the Riverside Slide
Yeah all a' us folks around Ouray County
Seen a lotta them cold black nights
When the only thing movin' is a big ol' plow
Flashin' them weird blue lights
We found the boy in the early spring
Still settin' the plow on its side
Yeah ya never quite know what time a' the night
You gonna die in the Riverside Slide <start> SO USED TO LOVING YOU

' Cedarwood Publishing BMI
So used to loving you I can't believe we're through
Nobody else will do since we're apart
I tried so hard to find someone to ease my mind
But they're just not my kind so used to lovin' you
Darlin' if you ever change you may still share my name
Don't hang your head in shame forget those mistakes you've made
No one lives a perfect life so forget your foolish pride
And put your fears aside then come back to me
So used to loving you... <start> You're at a business meeting that's what you think I believe
But to you life's one day party and it's always you who's here
Let's someone throw a party you go and leave me home
Tonight I'll throw a party of my own
Yes tonight I'll throw a party of my own
And mind will start the minute you'll come home
I'll have the lights all burning bright and then at three or four
Tonight I'll throw a party out the door
I don't care what the neighbors hear or what the neighbors see
They'll know the morning after a good time was head by me
This party that I'm throwing won't be quiet won't be small
But he'll be the biggest loudest one of all
Yes tonight I'll throw a party
Yes tonight I'll throw a party out the door <start> My poor uncle jimmy turk
He got his house full of water and dirt
In that flood of ' pine island bayou
Came thru his door
In that flood of '
That devil rain began t'poor
It swelled the banks of the sabine
Those waters dark and warm and mean
When that bayou began to crest
My uncle jimmy did his best
T'save his family and his home
To this day you can hear him moan <start> Working on a building a Holy Ghost building
For my Lord for my Lord
If I was a drunkard I tell you what I'd do
I would quit my drinking and work on that building too
Working on a building a Holy Ghost building
For my Lord yeah for my Lord
If I was a liar I tell you what I'd do
I would quit my lying and work on that building too
Working on a building it's a Holy Ghost building
For my Lord yeah for my Lord
Working on a building it's a Holy Ghost building
For my Lord yeah for my Lord
If I was a singer I tell you what I'd do
I would keep on singing and work on that building too <start> Fair weather lover that's what you've always been
My fair weather lover you're leaving once again
When the sun is shining and everything looks rosy
This is when you say you love me so
But when a storm appears oh it's all the different story
Just when I need you most of all
Fair weather lover...
You're always by my side and understand when I'm smiling
This is when you say you love me so
But when times are bad oh it's all the different story
Just when I need you most of all
Fair weather lover...
Oh but this time it don't matter go find yourself another
It's farewell fair weather lover <start> Now once I stood like a mountain high
Cold and rough and no sign of life
Didn't need no one didn't want no love
Yeah but that was before I felt her touch
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
What the whole world couldn't change
She did all alone she polished up the good
And she chipped away the wrong
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
With a willing heart and patient hands
She poured her love on a hopeless man
Oh the doubters laughed they couldn't see
And now they stare in disbelieve
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
What the whole world couldn't change
She did all alone she polished up the good
And then she chipped away the wrong
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
Now I ain't perfect by any means
But I suit her and that suits me
Hey I'm a miracle of a woman's love
And I'll be her rock till I turn to dust
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
What the whole world couldn't change
She did all alone she polished up the good
And then she chipped away the wrong
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
She made a man out of a mountain of stone <start> Here comes Johnny Come Lately
A dozen roses in his hand
Just to show me that he cares for me
Hes doing everything he can.
He wants to wrap his arms around me
And Im flattered that he does
But he dont stand a chance
And thats because
Chorus
Im in the middle of something
A Little busy right now
Tied up in something that I dont want out of
And I like this way
So heres a metaphor for how I feel inside
My heart is a door that reads occupied
From beginning to end
Im in the middle of something
Well I used to be lonely
I heard no knocking on my door
Well I was looking for somebody.
When it rains it really pours

Now that Im in love the guys are lined up down the hall
But I just walk on by
and tell them all hey
Chorus
Im in the middle of something
A Little busy right now
Tied up in something that I dont want out of
And I like this way
So heres a metaphor for how I feel inside
My heart is a door that reads occupied
From beginning to end
Im in the middle of something
Right smack dab
In the middle of love
Im sitting right dead center
in between the place where two hearts touch
But Im alright cause thats right where I am
Im in the middle of something
oh oh in the middle
oh yeah
Im in the middle of something
A little busy right now
I like it I like it this way
a little busy right now
tied up in something I dont want out of
And I like it this way
so heres a metaphor for how I feel inside
My heart is a door that reads occupied
From beginning to end
Im in the middle of something
Middle of something
In the middle of something

Somewhere somewhere
Boy boy yeah you

in the middle of something <start> Darlin' after you left I got that promotion
They transferred me out to La Jolla right on the ocean
And now I'm makin' more money than I can stand
I've got a house on the beach and a bunch of new friends
Oh you oughta hear what they say
Tellin' me that I've got it made
But
I've been better
Yeah I miss those times when we were still together
Right now lookin' back
I don't think the past has ever been this clear
And I realize sittin' here as I write this letter
Oh I've been better
Well I've been seein' a girl that I met out in Spring Valley
She's havin' the time of her life least that's what she tells me
She says it's love and to tell you the truth
I've tried my best to feel that way too
Oh but I always realize
When I look into her eyes
That
I've been better
Yeah I miss those times when we were still together
Right now lookin' back
I don't think the past has ever been this clear
And I realize sittin' here as I write this letter
Oh I've been better <start> Blame it all on my roots
I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know
The last one to show
I was the last one
You thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise
And the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you
Said honey we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh I've got friends in low places
Well I guess I was wrong
I just don't belong
But then I've been there before
Everything's all right
I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey I didn't mean
To cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well I'll be as high
As that ivory tower
That you're livin' in
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh I've got friends in low places
I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh I've got friends in low places
I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh I've got friends in low places
I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay. <start> I saw you walking down the street last night
I saw him walking by your side
I saw the way he stopped and held you tight
I saw the look in your eyes
Go on and tell him that you love him
Go on and show him he's the one
Go on and give him every sacred thing that you used to save for us
And see if I care
Look at the way you're tearing me apart baby
See if I care
Look at the tears falling in this heart baby
Go on go on go on
Yeah go on go on go on
And see if I care
I still can hear the way you whisper
Softly in my ear
I lay awake and I remember the way it felt to hold you near
Go on and run your fingers through his hair
Go on and lay by his side
Go on and wrap him in your dark surrender
And all your tender lies
And see if I care
Look at the way you're tearing me apart baby
See if I care
Look at the tears falling in this heart baby
Go on go on go on
Yeah go on go on go on
And see if I care <start> Chorus
Don't be sad 'cause you got
What you wanted
You should be glad to know
That I'm finally gone
Don't feel bad or be
Disappointed
'Cause you got what you
Want all along
Wasn't it you who said a
Blinded fool could see the
Clear plain truth about how
Deeply cruel it is to
Live a lie here with each other
And mourn a love that
Won't recover
As I recall those were the very
Words I heard you use
Chorus
Wasn't it me who asked so
Stupidly if there were
Things that I could maybe
Do or try to somehow
Hold what fell apart together
But you just coldly told me never
To even entertain the thought
That our love would survive <start> I got the feeling when I
Looked at you tonight
That you've given up trying
Have you left it up to me
To be the one to keep our love from dying
If I could I'd take you in my arms
And bring us back to being close
But how can I hold you
If you're letting go
I won't pretend I've got the
Answers figured out
But I can't stop believing
Hanging on to what we got
Is still a better way to go
Than leaving
I'd do anything to make you stay
But I can't do it all alone
How can I hold you
If you're letting go
So please don't let this be the end
Hold out some hope that we can try again
I'd do anything to make you stay
But I can't do it all alone
How can I hold you
If you're letting go <start> Come they told me parum pum pum pum
Our newborn King to see parum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring parum pum pum pum
To lay before the King parum pum pum pum

So to honor Him parum pum pum pum

Me and my drum <start> 
Single bars and single women
With a single thought in mind
Just to make it till the morning
Looking for what they can find
For a man they won't remember
For a night they can't forget
Do you come to this place often
May I light your cigarette
Drinkin' beer in Amarillo
Passing time and swaping jokes
Hoping for a new beginning
But beginning to lose hope
And you're waiting for that moment
When a glance becomes a stare
Mmm what's that perfume that you're wearing
Haven't I met you somewhere
Find a matchbook in the morning
With a name and number scrawled
When you phone a woman answers
And you wish you'd never called
Oh they're friendly when they meet you
But they're strangers when they go
Ahh do you mind if I come join you
Would you like to dance one more
And it's gettin' near to closing
And the seconds pass like years
Lots of friends to share the laughter
Not a one to share the tears
Oh and you wish they'd change that juke box
Cause you know every song it plays
Can I drop you off at my place
Oh what's the matter are you gay
You gotta twenty in your pocket
Got your toothbrush in your purse
Life could get a whole lot better
But it better not get worse
Single bars and single women
With a single thought in mind
Just to make it till the morning
Looking for what they can find <start> You stood by me whenever times were bad and never once did I hear you complain
You always made the best of what little bit we had
And held your hand up proud to wear my name
And that's just one of the reasons why I love you so much
You are the reason that I live
I know I've got a woman no other man can touch
Who gives me all the love she has to give
 steel 
You've sacrificed for dreams of mine that never did come true
You've done without to satisfy my needs
And everytime I've tried and failed I've found new strength in you
For not one time did you lose faith in me
And that's just one of the reasons... <start> Lovers yes I guess I've had a few
I've played the game like lovers do in the night alone
Feelin's they never meant a thing to me
I never knew how love could be until you came along
You made a believer out of me I can see it I can feel it
You made a believer out of me how could I believe that it's not true after lovin' you
Forever was just a word I used to say
Love was just a game I played that ended with the dawn
Funny with all the love that I've been through
Now I know till I met you I never loved at all
You made a believer out of me <start> Sweet William rose one winter's morn
Pray Lord to me speak truth
And tell me of that long lost love
Between Lady Margaret and you
Of Lady Margaret I know not
And she knows not of me
For I upon the midday sun
Some other's groom shall be
Lady Margaret sitting in her high window
Combing her long yellow hair
Spied sweet William and his new made bride
Riding up the road so fair
Down she threw her ivory comb
And down she threw her hair
And down she came from that high window
And was never seen no more
The sun sank low on William's home
His mind consumed with fear
He dreamt his home was full of white shroud
And the bed was flowing with tears
It was the time that night set in
And all were fast asleep
He spied Lady Margaret all cloaked in white
She was standing at the bed feet
How do you like you bed said she
How do you like your sheets
How do you like your new made bride
That's lying in your arms asleep
Very well do I like my bed said he
Still better I like my sheets
But best of all that fair young maid
That stands at my bed feet
He called on his milkwhite steed
As fast as the horse could ride
He rode 'til he came to fair Margaret's home
So load he called and cried
Is Lady Margaret in the house
Or is she in the hall
Or is she in her parlor room
Among the maiden's all
She's neither in the house said she
Nor is she in the hall
There Margaret's in the cold black coffin
With her face turned to the wall
Tear it down tear it down her ivory sheets
Oh tear them ever so fine
And let me kiss her cold corpse lips
For I know they'll never kiss mine
Once he kissed her pale white hand
And twice he kissed her cheek
Three times he kissed her cold corpse lips
And he fell in her arms asleep <start> Here I am stuck in my mind Just trying to get by
All you'll understand And will you get me
Everyday that comes my way I think about what you will say
Finding strength one day I will tell you I am gay
Take me or leave me now I've done my best to make you proud
My love for you will never change I hope you feel the same
Take me or leave me now I will still make you proud
I'm still your baby girl Take me or leave me 
After its off my chest I hope that you will try your best
Tell me that your fine Just give me that sign
Everyday its eating me Always consuming me
One thing on my mind Is this the right time
Take me or leave me now I've done my best to make you proud
My love for you will never change I hope you feel the same
Take me or leave me now I will still make you proud
I'm still your baby girl Take me or leave me 
La La La La La La La La 
Take me or leave me now I've done my best to make you proud
My love for you will never change I hope you feel the same
Take me or leave me now I will still make you proud
I'm still your baby girl Take me or leave me 
La La La La <start> In the doorway in the doorway
It was easy to forget
With his hands upon my waist
In my old Italian dress I was dizzy I was guilty
I wanted to confess in the doorway
One hand goes across my
And one hand down the other side
His mother lives down by the sea
His grandmere lives right next to her
His uncle waved as he drove by
I was waiting in the car
We had no words we had no words
So I fell asleep
I knew that I would take courage
If I had enough to drink <start> She ...
She came from the land of the cotton
A land that was nearly forgotten
By everyone
And she ...
She worked and she slaved so hard
A big ol' field was her backyard
In the delta sun
Oh but she sure could sing
Yes yes
She sure could sing
Then he ...
Looked down and he took a little pity
The whole town swore he decided
He help her some
And he
Didn't mind if she wasn't very pretty
For deep inside his heart he knew
She was the only one
Oh but she sure could sing
My my she sure could sing
She had faith and she had believin'
She led all the people together in singin'
And she prayed very night
To the Lord up above
Singin' hallelujah
Oh hallelujah
They ...
Would walk singin' songs by the river
Even when she knew for sure
She had to go away
And she
Never knew what her life had to give her
And never had to worry about it
For one single day
Oh but she sure could sing
Yes yes she sure could sing <start> I see the rainbow in your eyes
I see all the colors pass me by
I sure like the things my eyes can do
Especially when they see you
I hear the music of this day
I sure like the songs this world can play
But most of all I like your tune
When you whisper I love you
My senses don't like I get a definite high
When you're near I feel clear off the ground
Reach for my arms and I will give you the stars
There is nothing that is holding us down
I touch the textures of this earth
I felt for the good and I felt for the worse
But I never knew what touch could do
Until I was touched by you
My senses don't like I get a definite high
When you're near I feel clear off the ground
Reach for my arms and I will give you the stars
There is nothing that is holding us down
I see the rainbow in your eyes
I see all the colors pass me by
I sure like the things my eyes can do
Especially when they see you <start> There's a darkness upon me that's flooded in light
In the fine print they tell me what's wrong and what's right
And it comes in black and it comes in white
And I'm frightened by those that don't see it
When nothing is owed or deserved or expected
And your life doesn't change by the man that's elected
If you're loved by someone you're never rejected
Decide what to be and go be it
There was a dream and one day I could see it
Like a bird in a cage I broke in
And demanded that somebody free it
And there was a kid with a head full of doubt
So I'll scream 'til I die
And the last of those bad thoughts are finally out
There's a darkness upon you that's flooded in light
And in the fine print
They tell you what's wrong and what's right
And it flies by day and it flies by night
And I'm frightened by those who don't see it
There was a dream and one day I could see it
Like a bird in a cage I broke in
And demanded that somebody free it
And there was a kid with a head full of doubt
So I'll scream til I die
And the last of those bad thoughts are finally out
There was a dream and one day I could see it
Like a bird in a cage I broke in
And demanded that somebody free it
And there was a kid with a head full of doubt
So I'll scream 'til I die
And the last of those bad thoughts are finally out
There's a darkness upon me that's flooded in light
In the fine print they tell me what's wrong and what's right
There's a darkness upon me that's flooded in light
And I'm frightened by those who don't see it <start> You cheated me and made me lonely
I tried to be your very own
There'll be a day you'll want me only
But when I leave I'll be a long time gone
Be a long time gone
Be a long time gone
Yes when I leave I'll be a long time gone
You're gonna be sad you're gonna be weepin'
You're gonna be blue and all alone
You'll regret the day you seen me leavin'
'Cause when I leave I'll be a long time gone
Be a long time gone
Be a long time gone
Yes when I leave I'll be a long time gone
You'll see my face through tears and sorrow
You'll miss the love you called your own
Baby there'll be no tomorrow
'Cause when I leave I'll be a long time gone
Be a long time gone
Be a long time gone
Yes when I leave I'll be a long time gone
I'll be a long time gone
I'll be a long time gone
Yes when I leave I'll be a long time gone
Yes when I leave I'll be a long time gone <start> What'cha gonna do with the thirty six cents
Sticky with coke on your floorboard
When a woman on the street is huddled in the cold
On a sidewalk bench trying to keep warm
Do you call her over hand her the change
Ask her a story ask her her name
Or do you tell yourself
You're just a fool
Just a fool
To believe you can change the world
You're just a fool
Just a fool
To believe you can change the world
What'cha gonna do when you're watching t.v.
And an ad comes on
Yeah you know the kind
Flashin' up pictures of a child in need
For a dime a day you can save a life
Do you call the number reach out a hand
Or do you change the channel call it a scam
Or do you tell yourself
You're just a fool
Just a fool
To believe you can change the world
Don't listen to them when they say
You're just a fool
Just a fool
To believe you can change the world
Oh the smallest thing can make all the difference
Love is alive
Don't listen to 'em when they say
You're just a fool
Just a fool
To believe you can change the world
And the world's so big it can break your heart
And you just wanna help
Not sure where to start
So you close your eyes
And send up a prayer into the dark
You're just a fool
Just a fool
To believe you can change the world
Don't listen to them when they say
You're just a fool
Just a fool
To believe you can change the world
Oh the smallest thing can all the difference
Love is alive
Don't listen to them when they say
You're just a fool
Just a fool
To believe you can change the world <start> Whoa aw yeah
I'm docking out I'm loading up
Well I'm out of Alabama down to Louisiana
Halfway 'bout to New Orleans
Yeah I'm leaning on my Chevy
Rolling through the levees trying to get to where I wanna be
And I'm looking back at Texas
That's where I reckon I can finally put myself at ease
Check my life there at the border
Everything over my shoulder just Mexico Tequila and me
Yeah there's Mexico tequila and me that's all
Well I'm tired of the ratrace even tired of her sweet face
Sick of what I'm supposed to be
I need a little time to vegetate my mind
Escape from my reality
Just Mexico tequila and me
That's right
I'm not entirely unhappy 'cause sometime's life's crappy
Make me wanna stop and run
Take a threeday breather sip a Margarita
Drift away beside the sea
Just Mexico tequila and me ah yeah
Well my baby wants to hold me
Boss he wants to scold me momma won't quit calling me
The bank they want the payments
Sometimes they just can't take it
Got to find a place where I feel free
Just Mexico tequila and me ahha
Well I'm out of Alabama down to Louisiana
Halfway 'bout to New Orleans
Yeah I'm leaning on my Chevy
Rolling through the levees trying to get to where I wanna be
When I'm looking back at Texas
That's where I reckon I can finally put myself at ease
Check my life there at the border
Everything over my shoulder just Mexico tequila and me
Yeah Mexico tequila and me that's all
Just Mexico tequila and me aw yeah
Yeah a little sand a little sun a little sangria baby
Buenas noches <start> 
My life's an open book you read it on the radio
We've got no where to hide we got no where to go
But' if you still decide you want to take a ride
Meet me at the Wrecking ball
Wrecking Ball I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight
Meet me at the Wrecking Ball
Wrecking Ball I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight
I see smokey eyes right across the bar
I've seen that look before shining from star to star
Though I can't take that change
If you've got time for one dance <start> She keeps it all together
I always come unwound
She's cool calm and collected
I wanna paint the town
She's like a Sunday morning
I'm a dancehall Saturday night
She's like a stain glass window
I'm a lonestar neon light
She has another side
That no one sees but me
She is the only one
That brings me to my knees
There's something about Sinatra
And a bottle of Chardonnay
Without a single word
She takes my breath away
When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you need to love you
Right now kind of look in her eyes
She's always lookin' so fine
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look
She sparkles like a diamond
She twinkles like a star
She's like a ray of sunshine
That always melts my heart
And when I'm feeling empty
Her love makes me whole
Just like a country breeze
That soothes my weary soul
When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you need to love you
Right now that kind of look in her eyes
She's always lookin' so fine
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that
Slow dancin'
Romancin'
She's up to something
Wearin' nothin' but her beautiful smile
She's up to something
Wearin' nothin' but a beautiful smile
When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you need to love you
Right now that kind of look in her eyes
She's always lookin' so fine
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look
There's something about Sinatra
And a bottle of Chardonnay
Without a single word
She takes my breath away
She's like a Sunday morning
I'm a Saturday night
She's like a stain glass window
I'm a neon light <start> I should go back home and think of you.
I'll go back home and think of you. <start> Tonight as I lie here I'm sleepless any thoughts are flooding my mind
They're thoughts of peace and not trouble peace of a wonderful kind
Peace that I have a good woman a woman whom I adore
Tonight is our anniversary we were wed seven years ago
Seven years with a wonderful woman seven years with a love that won't end
Seven years with a wonderful woman will inspire any poor man
 fiddle  steel 
The moon sends its beams through our window they dance on your angel like face
They tell me you're God's gift from heaven a gift of his wonderful grace
I'll just slip out of bed while you sleep dear and bow with my knees to the floor
To thank God for seven years with you and to pray for seventy more
Seven years with a wonderful woman... <start>  Connie 
Soft as a voice of an angel breathing a lesson unheard
Hope with a gentle persuasion whispers a comforting word
 Both 
Wait till the darkness is over wait till the tempest is done
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow after the shower is gone
Whispering hope whispering hope oh how welcome Thy voice
Making my heart any sorrow rejoice
 Nat 
If in the dusk of the twilight dimmed be the region afar
Will not the deepening darkness writin' the glittering star
 Both 
Then when the night is upon us why should the heart sink away
When the dark midnight is over watch for the breaking of day
Whispering hope whispering... <start> I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul
It bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above
And just a little talk with Jesus made me whole
Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our famished cry
He will answer by and by
Now when you feel a little prayer turning
And you know the little talk with Jesus makes it right
Sometimes my path seems dreary without a ray of cheer
And then the cloud about me hides the light of day
The mists in me rise and hide the stormy skies
But just a little talk with Jesus clears the way
I may have doubts and fears my eyes be filled with tears
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and and night
I go to Him in prayer He knows my every care
And just a little talk with Jesus makes it right <start> In the twilight glow I see her blue eyes crying in the rain
As we kissed goodbye and parted I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dying ember only memories remain
Through the ages I'll remember blue eyes crying in the rain
Now my hair has turned to silver all my life I've loved in vain
I can see her star in heaven blue eyes crying in the rain
Some day when we meet up yonder we'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting and no blue eyes crying in the rain <start> Flip flops and bottle tops strewn across his hotel room
What a night what a party what a place Cancun
Got your purdy little head on my sun burnt chest
Girl we're wasting the day away
And it sure feels right with you right by my side
And I barely even know your name
Chorus
Baby your deep blue eyes and yours golden Tropicana tan
And the taste wine on your sweet lips sure did me in
Never felt like this from just one kiss
Never been in such a big old mess
Till I saw you in the moonlight dancing in that little sundress
The band was grooving had everybody movin' to the rhythm of a reggae tune
All the people all the faces all I saw was you
Now I'm wrapped in your arms and I never wanna leave this below the border love affair
There's a plane taking off with an empty seat and I don't even care
Chorus
Ain't it crazy how I found you in a world full of girls
Girl what did you do
Chorus
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na na na na  <start> When The Bees Are In The Hive  Bill Monroe

By the mill stream sits the Miller's pretty daughter
Her cheeks are like the first red rose of June
Her sweet voice sounds just like the rippling water
As so tenderly she hums an old love tune
But soon her song of joy has turned to sorrow
Her sweetheart now has come to say goodbye
She thinks of a sad and lonely morrow
And he hugs her as she murmers with a sigh
When the bees are in the hive and the honey in the comb
And the golden sunlight bends to kiss the dew
While the old mill wheel turns 'round I love you Mary
And when the bees are in the hive I'll come to you
By the old mill sits the lonely maid repining
And her face was like the spring rose far away
While she looked down in the silver waters shining
And she sees her golden locks are dimmed with grey
Long years she's waited there for his returning
All in vain she's thinking he'll come back someday
For the lamp of hope still in her heart is burning
As the old mill wheel turns 'round it seems to say <start> I heard no Christmas carols as I walked down the street
I heard no Merry Christmas from people I'd meet
It seemed you've made the whole world blue
Christmas ain't Christmas dear without you
I talked to a snowman and to my surprise when I spoke of you he started to cry
Now that's pretty sad to see a snowman turn blue
Christmas ain't Christmas dear without you
 steel 
No Christmas ain't Christmas since you went away
And now it seems like just any other day
Yes you turned my whole world blue Christmas ain't Christmas dear without you <start> Get your favorite photo and send it to me
Along with a curle from your hair
Write on the package so the postman will know
To treat it with tender lovin' care
Wrap up a dream or two and send them along
Send anything that you can send
If it's old or if it's new sweetheart I promise you
I'll treat it with tender lovin' care
For now my dream has ended and you found someone new
But though my dream has ended I'm still in love with you
Send along a memory of the happiness we shared
And when it comes I'll treat it with tender lovin' care
 steel 
For now my dream has ended... <start> Benjamin rode out of Montana
On a Palomino pony
He told me he was all alone
He lost his family in fortynine
Benjamin took me to San Diego
Guess we caused quite a commotion
Selling Pacific ocean water
And callin' it seaweed wine
Chorus
Oh I never had as good a friend as Benjamin
He loved to travel
He'd been ever' place I'd been and back again
That boy could unravel
Stories that would make your eyes
Big as blackberry pies I'm tellin' you
Life could be fun for anyone
Who had a good friend like Benjamin
Had a good friend like Benjamin
Well me and Ben thumbed a ride to Alabama
Spent the summer pickin' cotton
Now it was so doggone hot
We bought us a threespeed electric fan
Then at night we'd drink a CocaCola
Listen to the rain a'fallin'
Hearin' the bob white callin'
As though he'd know we'd understand
Chorus
Well Ben and me spent some time in Oklahoma
Livin' on a reservation
Workin' at the service station
Pumpin' gas and passin' time
We caught a train down to Harlan County
Thinkin' we were awful lucky
Just to walk along a Kentucky back road
Without no reason nor rhyme
Chorus
Had a good friend like Benjamin <start> Smooth talker
He thinks he'll be the one to walk her to his room
But for all of his schemin' he's only dreamin'
He might as well be gone
Because she's got her eyes on the dance floor
She's made up her mind
And the lady takes the cowboy every time
'Cause she's just dyin' to do the Texas step
And she just can't wait to strut her stuff
Dancin' to the 'Cotton Eyed Joe'
So she'll come dancin' till the band stops playin'
At  in the mornin'
And still have time for one beer before she goes
Off with her steppin' cowboy
She'll have time for one beer before they go
Tall and handsome
He thinks he'll probably land somewhere in her arms tonight
Well he thinks he's cool but she thinks he's a fool
He might as well turn and go
Because she's got her eyes on the dance floor
She's made up her mind
And the lady takes the cowboy every time
'Cause she's just dyin' to do the Texas step
And she just can't wait to strut her stuff
Dancin' to the 'Cotton Eyed Joe'
So she'll come dancin' till the band stops playin'
At  in the mornin'
And still have time for one beer before she goes
Off with her steppin' cowboy
She'll have time for one beer before she goes <start> One hand reaches out
And pulls a lost soul from harm
While a thousand more go unspoken for
And they say
What good have you done by saving just this one
It's like whispering a prayer
In the fury of a storm
And I hear them saying
You'll never change things
And no matter what you do
It's still the same thing
But it's not the world that I am changing
I do this so this world will know
That it will not change me
This heart still believes
That love and mercy still exist
While all the hatreds rage
And so many say
That love is all but pointless
In madness such as this
It's like trying to stop a fire
With the moisture from a kiss
And I hear them saying
You'll never change things
And no matter what you do
It's still the same thing
But it's not the world that I am changing
I do this so this world will know
That it will not change me
As long long as one heart still holds on
Then hope is never really gone
And I hear them saying
You'll never change things
And no matter what you do
It's still the same thing
But it's not the world that I am changing
I do this so this world we know
Never changes me
What I do is so this world will know
That it will not change me <start> It was warm now its cold.
It was young now its old.
Love was here now its gone
Simple song.
Once she did now she don't
Once we tried now we wont.
How could love go so wrong
Simple song.
Oh it don't take much to say it
And anyone can play it.
All you got to do is live it
And anybody can.
Simple tune simple words
Simple me simple her.
She was here now she's gone
Simple song.
Oh it don't take much to say it
And anyone can play it.
All you got to do is live it
And anybody can.
It was warm now its cold.
It was young now its old.
Love was here now its gone
Simple song <start> WE'RE GONNA HOLD ON
Writers George Jones Earl Montgomery
We're gonna hold on we're gonna hold on we're gonna hold on to each other
Life can be rough sometimes it's kind a real good love is hard to find
But the best love is the one we know and faith we have between us makes it grow
We're gonna hold on we're gonna hold on we're gonna hold on to each other
Some love lives and some love don't we've got the kind of love we want
It brings us happiness all through the day and nothing can ever make it go away
We're gonna hold on we're gonna hold on we're gonna hold on to each other
We're gonna hold on we're gonna hold on we're gonna hold on to each other <start> I slipped out of the house about sundown while mama was a washin' her hair
And you can bet your bottom dollar she'll come lookin' for me
When she finds that I'm not there
And if she catches her sweet thang runnin' around
I know there'll be the devil to pay
She'll come blowin' like a cyclone right through that door
And I can hear exactly what she'll say
Well has anybody here see sweet thang I got a notion he'll be headed this a way
Cause when my sweet thang is out tomocattin' around
He finds a sandbox like this to play
I want to tell all you barroom roses if my sweet thang does have a bite
You'd better take my advice and if you'll blink more than twice
You'd better have somethin' in your eyes
I gave my baby all my money on payday except a little she don't know that I got
Cause there's a cute little waitress at the corner cafe
And she seems to like me quite a lot
While we were sittin' in the back booth a havin' a talk
She believed in every word that I said
When the door blew open Loretta walked in yellin' loud enough to wake the dead
Well has anybody here see sweet thang...
You'd better take my advice... <start> 
There's a word we often mention all along life's weary way
It's the day that's made to praise the one unseen
It's been changed from holy to a holiday
And we seldom stop to think of what it means
But it's holy holy not a holiday holy holy not a holiday
So stop and think dear brother as you celebrate this day
Christmas is holy not a holiday
 organ 
I wonder how my Saviour feels to look down on this earth
And watch people fuss and fight and grab about their meals
How they cebrate his birth
Oh it's holy holy not a holiday...
Holy holy not a holiday... <start> Save me free me from my heart this time
Train's going down the track and I stay behind
Nothing can free me from this ball and chain
I made up my mind that I would live today
And you're keeping me going I know it's insane
Cause I love you and lose again
When the heart calls the mind obeys
And it knows better than me
Hold on one more day and maybe he'll be true
Nothing can free me from this ball and chain
I made up my mind that I would live today
And you're keeping me going I know it's insane
Cause I love you and I'll lose again
Save me free me from my heart this time
Train's going down the track and I stay behind
Nothing can free me from this ball and chain
I made up my mind that I would live today
And you're keeping me going I know it's insane
Cause I love you and I'll lose again <start> A couple inches taller
Another size smaller
A little curl in my hair
Used to wish I was older
Now I wish I was younger
Back when I didn't have a care
Most of the time I am happy with what God gave me
Once in a while I wish that some miracle would change me
Chorus
I'm OK with the way God made me
I have my days but doesn't everybody
It's not always easy for me to believe in myself
But I gotta remember
I'm always gonna be a better me than anybody else
And God doesn't make mistakes
Mama says I'm special
Calls me her little angel
Yeah I could almost do no wrong
But I trip and I stumble
Guess that's what keeps you humble
But I pick myself up and I carry on
I'll never be a flawless model of perfection
Nobody's perfect and I admit I'm no exception
Chorus <start> Written by billy burnette.
Oh go now and tell the world about it
Stop this show now
There's too few here to die
We don't want war now
Just go on out and shout it
We've tried so many times to change directions
We've even tried some peaceful demonstrations
I wish this could be
Oh I wish this could be the last war song
Well I just don't know
Leaders never listen
To anyone you know
They have so many reasons
Telling you the score
And make it sound confusing <start> My heart is out of control
This ole love struck soul
Just lives for the moment you're around
When I hold on to you
It is all I can do
Just to keep my feet on the ground
Desperately loving you desperately
When you're not here with me
I get a little bit crazy
Constantly I think about you constantly
Look at what you've done to me
I'm just like a little baby
Oh I love you desperately
Will I laugh will I cry
Will I live will I die
It all depends upon you
And it is dangerous I know
To be lost in you so
But I am and there's nothing I can do
Desperately loving you desperately
When you're not here with me
I get a little bit crazy
Constantly I think about you constantly
Look at what you've done to me
I'm just like a little baby
Oh I love you desperately
Desperately loving you desperately
When you're not here with me
I get a little bit crazy
Constantly I think about you constantly
Look at what you've done to me
I'm just like a little baby
Oh I love you desperately <start> Dear mama I'm coming home tomorrow
If you don't mind would you meet me at the train
Dear mama my wandering days're over and it's so good to be coming home again
Dear mama we'll walk the fields together
And through the valley we will stroll hand in hand
I just can't wait to see you and touch the soil of home so clean
But mama I'm not the boy I used to be
For I've been gone away too long and I've done everything that's wrong
But I think I've finally found myself at last
And just you wait and see another chance is all I need
But mama I'm not the boy I used to be
You see mama I've spent time in prison for a crime that I'm too ashamed to tell
And when you meet me there tomorrow don't be surprised at what you'll see
Cause mama I'm not the boy I used to be
For I've been gone away too long... <start> I made a lover's prayer
I made a lover's prayer
Then watched the sky
Then wanted to cry
It's only you and I
And how I try
I made a lover's prayer
I made a lover's prayer
I made a lover's prayer
Help me rise above
What I'm thinking of
Just a little more love
Just a little more love
I made a lover's prayer
I made a lover's prayer
I made a lover's prayer <start> Touch me like I touch you
Hold me like I hold you
Kiss me like I kiss you
One more time tonight
Please say you won't leave me
Say you still need me
Say you still love me
One more time
One more time tonight
I'll dance all night with you
I'll do all you want me to
I'll show you my love is true
One more time tonight
Touch me like I touch you
Hold me like I hold you
Kiss me like I kiss you
One more time for all time
Till' the end of time tonight <start> I'm happy when you're happy and I cry each time you're sad
It fills my life completely when you hold my hand
The greatest things I've ever seen is anything you do
And I'm so happy just to be any part of you
Any part of you is all I ever want to be anything you'll ask of me I'll do it willingly
For you're the keeper of the key that makes my dreams come true
And I'm so happy just to be any part of you
 steel 
The greatest things I've ever seen is anything you do
And I'm so happy just to be any part of you <start> There's a dark and a troubled side of life
There's a bright and a sunny side too
Though we meet with the dark nest of strife
The sunny side we also may view
Keep on the sunny side
Always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day
It will brighten all our way
If we keep on the sunny side of life
Though the storm and its fury breaks today
Crushing hopes that we cherish so dear
The clouds and storm will in time pass away
And the sun again will shine bright and clear
Let us treat with a song of hope each day
Though the moment be cloudy or clear
Let us trust in our Savior old ways
He will keep us everyone in His care
Keep on the sunny side
Always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day
It will brighten all our way
If we keep on the sunny side of life <start> Everything I need all depends on you
Everything I want is everything you do
It's been handed down through time
It's really nothing new
Boy meets girl I meet you
A love song that could never be untrue
Chorus
All I need is everything I want
It's a fundamental greed
All I need is everything you flaunt
That's a language I can read
All I need is everything I want
And that makes you everything I need
Everything I need is on my onetrack mind
Everything I want is where I draw the line
I'll take all you've got to give
Spend up all your precious time
You can't undo the ties that bind
Or hide the moon that needs the sun to shine
Chorus
Everything I need can't get it on TV
Everything I need is absolutely free
Everything I need is pure biology
That will bring me to my bended knee
My craving you will sweetly torture me
Chorus <start> When we're all alone dear
And I'm in your arm
Are you teasing me
When you're telling me
How you thrill to my charms
Are you teasing me
Are you untrue when I'm not with you
When we're apart are you free
Tell me darling while our love is still young
Are you teasing me
You say that my kiss
Sends your heart in up world
Are you teasing me
And that you'll be mine
Till the end of the world
Are you teasing me
You tell me my love makes my life complete
And tight in my arms you wanna be
Tell me darling while our love is still young
Are you teasing me <start> We're looking for The King
The new Messiah
We're following the star
Shining brighter
Old man won't you help us if you can
He shook his head
But he pointed his hand
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem
I see you've traveled far
Bearing treasures
You say these gifts are for
The new Kings pleasures
Well I've heard
That a King might come
But up 'til now there hasn't been one
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem <start> Let's put our world back together
Let's try our love one more time
Let's put our world back together
Without you in my world the sun won't shine
I've tried but I can't live my life without you
There's darkness in my world all the time
We had everything together then it just fell apart
I've lost my heart to you don't take my mind
Let's put our world back together...
For without you in my world the sun won't shine <start> Her memory was a mountain
As tall as it was wide
It cast a cold dark shadow
Across this heart of mine
I tried to rise above it
Might have rolled a stone or two
The mountain moved
And I could see
A vision of forever standing right in front of me
The earth stood still
And the light broke through
Some miracles only love can do
The mountain moved
I say you smiling at me
I heard you speak my name
You reached out to hold me
And I let go of yesterday
It's still there in the distance
But it's fading from my view
'Cause last night for the first time
The mountain moved
And I could see
A vision of forever standing right in front of me
The earth stood still
And the light broke through
Some miracles only love can do
The mountain moved <start> 
We rented a convertible in San Bernadino
We were driving for driving's sake
Across the tortured waterless mountains
Through the moonscape of Mono Lake
The lights of earth had faded behind
The stars were fat and sleek
The universe seemed enormous
So how could we be unique
We scanned the voids for humanoids
And an answer to the question Why
Carramba What were we thinking
Cause we were borning to die
To the aliens above we are just tiny anys
They could crush with their giant feet
They could smash our car and mash us into
A little bit of hamburger meat
So let the wind blow through your head
Your thoughts don't matter anyway
We're insignificant baby
And we're all gonna fade away
We only stopped in Reno for a very short time
But the lights were way too bright
We got tired of spending our winnings
And went spinning out into the night
In the desert we saw this giant man
Exploding like the Fourth of July
Slowly we turned to say hello
When he vaporized into the sky
We're feeling like a bunch of hothouse tomatoes
Riding in a bubblepack box
With nothing between us and a big hungry worm
But this canvas roof and the push button locks
To the aliens above we are just tiny anys
They could crush with their giant feet
They could smash our car and mash us into
A little bit of hamburger meat
And then someday the whole planet'll blow
And we're all gonna suffocate
We're insignificant baby
And we just think it's great
Insignificant
Get it over
Cut our taxes
Make it so
Marfa Lights
Can't get no
Where's our luggage
Just say thanks
That oughta do it <start> The old hometown looks the same as I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and my papa
And down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to meet me
Arms reaching smiling sweetly
It's so good to touch the green green grass of home
The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's the old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Then I awake and look around me
At the gray walls that surround me
And I realized I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green green grass of home <start> If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you
Baby we're really in love
If you're happy with me like I'm happy with you
Old Cupid just gave us a shove
If you're thinkin' of me like I'm thinkin' of you
I know what you're thinkin' of
If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you
Baby we're really in love
Well I run around in circles
And turn in fire alarms
I'm nut as fruit bake
When you're not in my arms
If you're meant for me like I'm meant for you
Baby we fit like a glove
If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you
Baby we're really in love
If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you
Baby we're really in love
If you're countin' on me like I'm countin' on you
Old Cupid just gave us a shove
If you're dreamin' of me like I'm dreamin' of you
I know what you're dreamin' of
If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you
Baby we're really in love <start> Before I knew your name I was not blistered or burned
I gave love everything before you had it returned
Before I knew your name I had my pride in tact
But you set my heart on fire before you gave it back
So I'm gonna rewind to a place and time
To the man I was before your love
Wrecked my heart and my soul and my mind
Before I knew your name before I knew your name
Ain't no drink or drug
That's gonna get me there
I've been down that road your still just as gone
After the fog has cleared
So I'm gonna rewind to a place and time
To the man I was before your love
Wrecked my heart and my soul and my mind
Before I knew your name before I knew your name
Is it somewhere south of Austin
Hiding in St. Paul
In the deserts east of L.A.
Hell I might try them all
Somewhere to rewind to a place and time
To the man I was before your love
Wrecked my heart and my soul and my mind
Before I knew your name before I knew your name
Before I knew your name before I knew your name <start> One day train was passin' I caught it comin' by
Look this old world over under God's blue sky
My darlin' stood there weepin' as I was looking back
Kissed my baby cryin' in the smoke along the track
Goodbye so long until I come back home you'll be my dream
Goodbye so long there's lots of places that I've never seen
I'll always be a drifter but I'll come driftin' back
Where I left you cryin' in the smoke along the track
I like to keep on goin' it helps me when I'm blue
Get the urge to travel that's all I want to do
I just can't seem to settle down because I like to roam
When I hear that whistle blow I've gotta move along
Goodbye so long there's something down the track keeps callin' me
Goodbye so long I guess that's just the way I'll always be
So when I get that feelin' don't try to hold me back
I'd only leave you cryin' in the smoke along the track
I know my baby loves me I love my baby too
He don't understand me when I'm feelin' blue
When I hear that whistle blow I hurry home and pack
Leave my baby cryin' in the smoke along the track
Goodbye so long I hate to leave you but I've got to go
Goodbye so long it's comin' down just hear that whistle blow
It'll be here in a minute you'll wave and I'll look back
I'm gonna leave you cryin' in the smoke along the track
Goodbye so long until I come back home you'll be my dream
Goodbye so long there's lots of places that I've never seen
I'll always be a drifter and I'll come driftin' back
Where I left you cryin' in the smoke along the track
Oh I'm gonna leave you cryin' in the smoke along the track
Terrific
Nash Randers
Thank you
God bless you all
You're terrific <start> Last night as I laid on the prairie and looked at the stars in the sky
I wondered if ever a cowboy would drift to that sweet by and by
Roll along roll along roll on little doggies roll on roll on
Roll along roll along roll on little doggies roll on roll on
The road to that bright happy region is a dim narrow trail so they say
But the broad one that leads to prediction is posted and blazed all the way
They say there will be a great roundup and cowboys like doggies will stand
To be marched by the riders of judgement who are posted and know every brand
Roll along roll along...
They say he will never forget you that he knows every action and look
So for safety you'd better get branded have your name in the great Tally Book
Roll along roll along... <start> If when you give the best of your service telling the world that the Saviour has come
Be not dismayed when man don't believe you he'll understand and say well done
Refrain
Oh when I come to the end of my journey weary of life the battle is won
Caring the staff and the cross of redemption he'll understand and say well done
Misunderstood the savior of sinners hung on the cross he was God's only son
Oh hear Him call to His father in heaven let not my will but Thine be done.
If when you've tried and failed in your trying hands sore and scarred from the work you've begun
Take up your cross and come quickly to Jesus He'll understand and say well done. <start> Oh you told me you had found another that I no longer fit into your plans
Don't apologize I said for it don't matter but you know what a liar I am
With a smile on my face I wished you well dear
With the happiness at last you say you've found
But if you knew how I've tossed and I've tumbled then you'd know what a liar I am
 steel 
I watched you walk away with your new love
Watched my dream world tumble to the ground
I told all of our friends I'm glad it's over but they know what a liar I am
With a smile on my face...
Now you know what a liar I am <start> Writers Doug Supernaw Lonnie Atkinson
I got a few extra dollars that I can play with
And there's no one I'd rather spend them on than you
So how about I pick you up at eight dear
We'll find a candlelit table for two
I'll buy you a rose and a bottle of champagne
In hope that you will see what I'm trying to explain
Nobody else can make me feel that way that you do
I'm so in love with you
I know a place after dinner to go dancin'
Where the spinnin' ball cast stars around the room
We'll do the lovers waltz until they close dear
Then go parkin' just like we used to do <start> Daddy's will was stronger than the winds of a hurricane
Steady as a stone wall never did hear him complain
There were times when we had nothing but the hope in his eyes
His spirit went unbroken and his faith was never tried
Daddy's will held us together
Determined he would make a better life for us all
He sacrificed unselfishly so our dreams could be fulfilled
But then again Daddies will
Got a sister on the west coast and another who lives back east
I moved up to Nashville where I'm living out my dreams
But we all stay in touch these days talking on the line
'Bout how hard it is raising kids then we're reminded of those times

Daddy's will held us together
Determined he would make a better life for us all
He sacrificed unselfishly so our dreams could be fulfilled
But then again Daddies will
I won't forget the summer when Daddy passed away
Mama opened up the safe and read the will he made
It said our family fortune lies within our hearts
Then our eyes filled with tears but no one fell apart

Daddy's will held us together
Determined he would make a better life for us all
He sacrificed unselfishly so our dreams could be fulfilled
But then again Daddies will
Until the end you know Daddies will <start> He asked her to dance three songs ago
Now she pulls him closer as the music slows
The lights are growin dim it's just her and him and the band
Funny I used to love this song
I though it was our song but I guess I was wrong
From where I'm sittin I can see where I stand
Chorus
From where I'm sittin I can see where I stand
She's got her head on his shoulder and her heart in his hands
Thing's are pretty clear when a fool understands
Lord from where I'm sittin I can see where I stand
I've never seen her dance like that before
Don't think I can take much of this anymore
He's no longer the stranger and it looks like I am
I always dreamed I'd see that look in her eyes
But I never dreamed it would be for some other guy
And from where I'm sittin I can see where I stand <start> Now stop that small talk turn that light off
It aint my fault you look so fine
My hearts achin and I aint fakin
I dont ask for much of nuthin' I just need a little lovin
Come on babe come a little closer
Honey move it over feels so right
Pull that shade just a little lower
Come a little closer baby tonight
Now put that phone down shut that door now
Lets just think about me and you
My hearts racin' time is a wastin
I dont want much of nothin a little kiss a little hugin
Come on babe come a little closer
Honey move it over feels so right
Pull that shade just a little lower
Come a little closer baby tonight
Cut off that late show turn that lamp low
Honey you know how I feel
My heart's beatin the night is pleasin'
I aint askin' that much of ya all I want to do is love ya
Come on babe come a little closer
Honey move it over feels so right
Pull that shade just a little lower
Come a little closer baby tonight
Come on babe come a little closer
Honey move it over feels so right
Pull that shade just a little lower
Come a little closer baby tonight <start> Spare In The Trunk 
Undone undone I cried through clenched teeth
I was aiming for drama I was comic relief
Undone indeed you cooed as you put me to bed
The words sure were silly but it's cute they were said
Though you are younger you know what you're doing
You push to the edge pull back from the ruin
Tho I am older I am not so brave
I long to bewilder I tend to behave
I know that you think that I think that you know
My love's like spare in the trunk
I know what you think but I think you should know
I love like down the stairs drunk <start> Man you should have seen me way back then
I could tell a tale I could make a spin
I could tell you black was white I could tell you day was night
Not only that I could tell you why
Back then I could really tel a lie
Well I'd hire a kid to say he was lame
Then I'd touch him and make him walk again
Then I'd pull some magic trick I'd pretend to heal the sick
I was takin' everything they had to give
It wasn't all that bad a way to live
Well I'm in this desert town and it's hot as hell
But no one's byuin' what I got to sell
I make my lame kid walk I make a dumb guy talk
I'm preachin' up a storm both night and day
But everyone just turns and walks away
Well I can see that I'm only wasting time
So I head across the road to drink some wine
This old man comes up to me He says I seen you on the street
You're pretty good if I do say myself
But the guy that come through here last month he was sometin' else
Instead of allin' out for fire from above
He just gets real quiet and talks about love
And I'll tell you sometin' funny He didn't want nobody's money
Now I'm not exactly sure what this all means
But it's the damndest thing I swear I've ever seen
Well since that time every town is the same
I can't make a dime I don't know why I came
I decide I'll go and find him And find out who's behind him
He has everyone convinced that he's for real
Well I figure we can work us out a deal
So he offers me a job and I say fine
He says I'll get paid off on down the line
Well I guess I'll string along Don't see how too much can go wrong
As long as he pays my way I guess I'll follow
We're headed for Jerusalem tomorrow <start> Pair of boots and a sack of clothes
Free and easy down the road I go
Hanging memories on the high line poles
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go
Ragweed's rocking on the radio
Free and easy down the road I go
So I keep rolling like an old banjo
Free and easy down the road I go
Got the sun shining on me like a big spotlight
So I know everything is gonna be alright
Ain't no telling where the wind might blow
Free and easy down the road I go
Living life like a Sunday stroll
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go
If you only get to go around one time
I'm gonna sit back and try to enjoy the ride
I could make a million or wind up broke
Free and easy down the road I go
Can't take it with you when you go so
Free and easy down the road I go
Someday I know it's gonna take me home so
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go <start> 
I've been lonesome
I've been empty
I got an achin'
Way down inside
I need someone
someone to hold me
Pull down the shade
Turn out the light
And love me tonight.
Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door.
I need you so now
Come on let's go now
Kick off your shoes
Turn out the light
And love me tonight.
 Instrumental 
Now don't you worry
We're all alone now
Let your hair down
Sit by my side
Turn off the T.V.
Put on some music
Pull down the shade
Turn out the light
And love me tonight
Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door.
I need you so now
Come on let go now
Kick off your shoes
Turn out the light
And love me tonight... <start> Baby why you wanna cry
You really oughta know that I
Just have to walk away sometimes
We're gonna do what lovers do
We're gonna have a fight or two
But I ain't ever changin' my mind
Crazy girl don't you know that I love you
And I wouldn't dream of goin' nowhere
Silly woman come here let me hold you
Have I told you lately
I love you like crazy girl
Wouldn't miss a single day
I'd probably just fade away
Without you I'd lose my mind
Before you ever came along
I was living life all wrong
Crazy girl don't you know that I love you
And I wouldn't dream of goin' nowhere
Silly woman come here let me hold you
Have I told you lately
I love you like crazy girl
Crazy girl
Crazy girl don't you know that I love you
And I wouldn't dream of goin' nowhere
Silly woman come here let me hold you
Have I told you lately
I love you like
Crazy girl don't you know that I love you
And I wouldn't dream of goin' nowhere
Silly woman come here let me hold you
Have I told you lately
I love you like crazy girl
Like crazy
Crazy girl
Like crazy
Crazy girl
Like crazy <start> Here's my grandpa's old Gibson
And a girl of no importance
A shot of whiskey sitting on the bar
Yeah I used to give a damn I used to try real hard
But I'll give in tonight chances are
One foot on the narrow way
And one foot on the ledge
Sifting through the devil's lies
From what the good book says
If I'm goin' any where
I'll probably go too far
Probably away from you
Chances are chances are
There's a lonely corner waiting
To seats left for playing
I'll tell her everything she wants to hear
I'm not worse love this making
I'm better at the breakin'
A guy like me knows how to disappear
One foot on the narrow way  and one foot on the ledge
Sifting through the devil's lies from what the good book says
If I'm goin' any where
I'll probably go too far
Probably away from you
Chances are chances are
Hold me like I mean it
Say 'til you believe it
And we'll see if we can fill an empty heart
But I won't tell you what the chances are
One foot on the narrow way  and one foot on the ledge
Sifting through the devil's lies from what the good book says
If I'm goin' any where
I'll probably go too far
Probably away from you
Chances are chances are <start> Black wall weeping
When I go to see the king
Put my dyin' diamond on
And the song in the honeybread
With my dyin' diamond by and by... <start> I'm Gonna shine up my boots
I'm gonna go into town
I'm gonna scrape up  dollars
I'm gonna throw it around
I'm gonna buy me a dance
first lovely lady that I see
And when the dance is through
I'll say will you marry me
I'm gonna shine up my boots
I'm gonna go into town
I'm gonna scrape up  dollars
I'm gonna throw it around
I'm gonna find me a game
Of hold 'em if I can
and fold 'em all night long
til I got me a hand
I'm gonna buy us a ranch
With a Palomino Herd
And I won't mean no harm
babe and I won't say a word.
When misery comes to call
A gift to him my life
I'll sit with him awhile
and share my horse my hole my wife
I'm gonna shine up my boots
I'm gonna go into town
I'm gonna scrape up  dollars
I'm gonna throw it around.
I'm gonna buy me a dance
first lovely lady that i see
and when the dance is through
I'll say will you marry me <start> Monday morning and I best be on my way got a feeling it will be a busy day
Doing something I'm not looking forward to wish I didn't have to miss you
Broke the clock because I wound it up too tight
Lucky me I didn't sleep a wink last night
So I was up on time to do what I must do wish I didn't have to miss you miss you
Wonder whose glasses that I'm seeing through
Cause I'm seeing everything but you everything but you
Now it's Saturday and I may go for a hike
Cause when it's Sunday it'll be Sunday day and night
Red is red black is black and blue is blue wish I didn't have to miss you miss you
 guitar 
Wonder whose glasses...
Wish I didn't have to miss you miss you <start>  keep reaching for you
 keep calling for you

I must say that I don't care hold my head up in the air
Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call
But when the day is through my heartache starts anew
And that's when I miss you most of all
And my arms keep reaching for you my eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you and my shoes keep walking back to you
 strings 
No matter how much I pretend I wish I had you back again
For nothing else means half as much as you
Our old world just seemed to die the day you said goodbye
And I can't forget no matter what I do
And my arms keep reaching for you...

My shoes keep walking back to you <start> Jody like a melody
play inside my head
till the thought of you is more than I can stand
just to think of having you is music to my soul
you make me feel
as though the world is in my hands
jody like a melody
you warm me
and then leave me
with a chill
I can't believe the sun will rise
without me looking in your eyes
and knowing that your love has made me strong
why you left I'll never know
the fire you built will always glow
I only know I woke to find you gone
jody like a melody
you warm me
and then leave me
with a chill
jody I can't keep my thoughts
about me in the daytime
when your memory is enough to make me blind
and late at night I lie awake
and wait for you to come and when you don't
you know I almost lose my mind
jody like a melody
you warm me
and then leave me
with a chill
jody like a melody... <start> Well my old shoes are layin' on the floor 'cause I ain't agonna wear 'em no more
They took me many miles down many hard roads but that's what shoes are for
The time has flown and I've outgrown every shoe I ever wore
And I guess my bare feet will have to carry me one road more
Lord I ain't got a lick of sense I got a crazy mind
'Cause I don't wanna leave and I don't wanna stay behind
Well at the end of this one last road they say there's always an open door
And I guess my bare feet will have to carry me one road more
Well I never could move my feet too fast in a pair of rich man's shoes
And a rain shoe's life can last as long as a woman's blues
Well I told the line this one last time now I got something else in store
And I guess my bare feet will have to carry me one road more
Lord I ain't got a lick of sense I got a crazy mind
'Cause I don't wanna leave and I don't wanna stay behind
Well at the end of this one last road they say there's always an open door
And I guess my bare feet will have to carry me one road more
OK let's go Joey
Well I've walked through the city streets in the sun and the rain and the wind and the snow
And I've walked through the mountains and the valleys when there was nowhere else to go
This time I'll just follow the wind and it can blow and the rain can pour
And my bare feet are gonna have to carry me one road more
Lord I ain't got a lick of sense I got a crazy mind
'Cause I don't wanna leave and I don't wanna stay behind
Well at the end of this one last road they say there's always an open door
And I guess my bare feet will have to carry me one road more
Yeah my bare feet are gonna have to carry me one road more <start> Therre's things in my life that I've been missin'
The touch of a woman and lovin' after dark
Come here lately the woman I've been kissin'
She comes from Kentucky boys and she don't have a heart
Bartender he don't mind he sits 'em up the same
I ain't ben sober since it's over got no plans to change
I traded my tomorrows to remain in yesterday
Whiskey Tears are fallin' here and each one cries here name
I used to be so afraid of dyin'
I lived every moment for lovin' her
But when she walked away my heart quit tryin'
And now I'm no stranger to hurt
Bartender he don't mind he sits 'em up the same
I ain't been sober since it's over got no plans to change
I traded my tomorrows to remain in yesterday
Whiskey Tears are fallin' here and each one cries here name <start> My father was a farmer
But his head was in the sky
He worked everyday but Sunday
'Til the day he died
He prayed for rain and thunder
And listened for the sound
In the dry years he went under
He never got off the ground
We all dream when we're younger
That we will do great things
Me I used to have a hunger
To wear a pilot's wings
But the circle's that I ran in
Turned my head around
And the planes I had my plans in
Never got off the ground
Don't raise your hopes
You hear so many say
The higher they get
The closer they are to flying away
Fly away
Don't raise your hopes
You hear so many say
The higher they get
The closer they are to flying away
They say there but for fortune
Is the way it would have been
If we could take a bigger portion
We'd fill our hands again
You see them on the sidewalks
In the parks all over town
Those who've taken flight
Never got off the ground <start> Is it getting better or do you feel the same
Will it make it easier on you now you got someone to blame
You say one love one life when it's one need in the night.
One love we get to share it
Leaves you baby if you don't care for it.
Did I disappoint you or leave a bad taste in your mouth
You act like you never had love and you want me to go without.
Well it's too late tonight to drag the past out into the light.
We're one but we're not the same.
We get to carry each other carry each other one
Have you come here for forgiveness
Have you come to raise the dead
Have you come here to play Jesus to the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much more than a lot
You gave me nothing now it's all I got.
We're one but we're not the same.
Well we hurt each other then we do it again.
You say love is a temple love a higher law
Love is a temple love the higher law.
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got when all you got is hurt.
One love one blood one life you got to do what you should.
One life with each other sisters brothers.
One life but we're not the same.
We get to carry each other carry each other.
One one. <start> Just outside these prison bars
The hanging tree is waitin'
At sunrise I'll meet darkness
And death will say hello
Darling touch your lips to mine
And tell me you love me
Promise me again before you go
Will you visit me on Sundays
Will you bring me pretty flowers
Will your big blue eyes be misty
Will you brush away a tear
A grave is filled with silence
If a sleeping man could hear
Darling would I hear
Your footsteps up there
Promise me that time won't
Separate me from your memory
That you'll remember me
Until the days of silver hair
If not for you I know
I'd lose my mind before morning
Hold me close and
Tell me you still care
Will you visit me on Sundays
Will you bring me pretty flowers
Will your big blue eyes be misty
Will you brush away a tear
A grave is filled with silence
If a sleeping man could hear
Darling would I hear
Your footsteps up there <start> Here is one that we took one Sunday afternoon I remember it was in the summer time
On the back it says eight eleven sixty five the same day you promised to be mine
But old pictures have a way of fading like a love that wasn't meant to be
Still each night I dig out the family album but old photographs sure get to me
 piano 
Here it is it's the last one that we took together
Though it's faded a little more than the rest
I suppose it's because of all the tearstains on it
Bit it's the one that to me you look the best
Yes old pictures have a way...
Yes old photographs sure get to me <start> Funny thing about a mind
Lookin' for that brighter side
It's the only way that I can find
To let my feelings hide
But every now and then
I falter back on old memories
And I'm right back in love again
And back down on my knees
And I'm finding out the hard way
There'll never be a time when I don't think about you
And I'm finding out the hard way
At least here in my mind I won't go on without you
All the times I reminisce
I'm finally realizing this
Until it's gone it can't be missed
But I'm finding out the hard way
Sure I'm gonna make it through
The sun'll overtake the night again
Then it's out of my mind with you
And let another day back in
And for a while I'll carry on
But what you said is surely comin' true
And although it might not last that long
The times are not so few
I'm finding out the hard way <start> Well since the day the world began
I know God has had a master plan
He made a sky to hold the sun
He made sands to hold the sea
He made hearts for never ending love
And he made you for me
Chorus
No hurricane no driving rain
Has our kind of power
No valley wide no mountain slide
Can hold a love like ours
No ocean deep no fire's heat
Can break a bond so true
Nothing Nothing Nothing in this world's
As strong as me and you
Through all the days and darkest nights
Our love will be the guiding light
With every breath I take
And every day I'm awake
This love of ours will never fade
Until the end of time
Chorus
Oh no love I know of
Can hold me like you do
Chorus
Strong as me and you
As strong as me and you <start> He was kinda like Superman
Show up save the day disappear and then
We wouldn't hear from him 'til Christmas
He was a whole lotta fun
Til he got one drink too drunk
A Fight would start he'd be breaking hearts and dishes
I used to say that I'd be damned
Before I'd ever fall in love with a man
Like the one Mama wasted her youth on
I wait up all night alone I feel like I'm six years old again
You're just like him
Daddy had the bluest eyes
Kept my Mama hypnotized
Now I finally realize the reason
They say love's like coming home
And I came from a broken one
So why am I surprised you're always leaving
I used to say that I'd be damned before I'd ever fall in love with a man
Like the one Mama wasted her youth on
And I wait up all night alone I feel like I'm six years old again
You're just like him <start> The Concho Valley's on fire tonight
Spilling out into the street
The blessed scream of a newborn dream
Making love in my backseat
All of us together in the glow of the dusty headlights
All the little pretties with the stars in their hair
Sipping titos and crystal light
It's another round of sound checks and train wrecks
The lost boys and the rejects
Falling angels dancing to the music
Drifting softly on the southern wind
Talking like the heroes that we won't be
Spittin' out the game that little Jimmy sold me
Still fighting for each other
Though it feels like we'll never win
American saint American saint
Now Philly Joe lives west of Alice
The hippy prince of the wild
He got pinch for possession in a real hard land
But he never lost his style
He still works the rigs six months out of the year
Old Crow fever a story to tell and a menthol behind his ear
It's another round of sound checks and train wrecks
The lost boys and the rejects
Falling angels dancing to the music
Drifting softly on the southern wind
Talking like the heroes that we won't be
Spittin' out the game that little Jimmy sold me
Still fighting for each other
Though it feels like we'll never win
American saint American saint
Now I'm north of Waxahachie
I'm wondering where I go from here
The Baptists say that if I don't change
I won't see next year
It's another round of sound checks and train wrecks
The lost boys and the rejects
Falling angels dancing to the music
Drifting softly on the southern wind
Talking like the heroes that we won't be
Spittin' out the game that little Jimmy sold me
Fighting for each other
It feels like we'll never win
American saint American saint American saint <start> How's the view from the top of the world I wonder are you still my girl
From so far above me can you hear my plea wait for me at the top of the world
I just thought you might like to know that someone down here below
Is hopefully climbing the ladder of fortune
Don't step on my fingers don't make me let go
From your view at the top of the world do you remember you're still my girl
Or have you forgotten your promise to me that we'd meet at the top of the world <start> I used to talk about coincidence
And how true love is only found by chance
Now I look at you and I'm convinced
There are no accidents
I can see that every time I chose
What I thought to be just some wrong road
Lead me here holdin' you this close
There are no accidents
One kiss and I knew for certain
Love so absolutely perfect
Can't be anything but meant to be
There's just no other way to explain you with me
The sun goes down and the moon comes up
The tide rolls in the stars appear above
And you and I fallin' so in love
There are no accidents
One kiss and I knew for certain
Love so absolutely perfect
Can't be anything but meant to be
There's just no other way to explain you with me
I used to talk about coincidence
And how true love is only found by chance
An' now I look at you and I'm convinced
There are no accidents there are no accidents
There are no accidents <start> What was it like for you
I can tell you in truth what it was like for me.
To be  in July
 in July
License in my hand
Freedom on my mind
I was  in July
 in July
The summer to my left
And no one to my right.
What did you want to hear on your radio
Even if it did not come in clear
You'd still be  in July
 in July
With license in your hand
And freedom on your mind.
If you're  in July
 in July
With summer to your left
And no one to your right
For me it was a shortcut road
The girl was new and the car was old.
Were you in love like me
Or at least as in love as you can be
When you're  in July
 in July
With license in your hand
And freedom on your mind
I was  in July
 in July
With summer to my left
And no one to my right. <start> Oh it's springtime in the mountains
And I'm full of mountain dew
Can't even read my catalog
Like I used to do
I'm asettin' in that little shed
That's right back of the house
Here comes old Jake with all the hounds
But he's gonna hear me shout
Oh I won't go huntin' with you Jake
But I'll go chasin' women
So put them hounds back in the pens
And quit your silly grinin'
Well the moon is bright and I'm half tight
My life is just beginin'
I won't go huntin' with you Jake
But I'll go chasin' women
Let's go down to the meetin' house
And wait till they start home
Them gals that live on Possum Creek
We'll always leave alone
We'll run them down the corn rows
Them sassy little misses
We'll scare them pretty gals to death
We'll stop and throw 'em kisses
Oh I won't go huntin' with you Jake
But I'll go chasin' women
So put them hounds back in the pens
And quit your silly grinin'
Well the moon is bright and I'm half tight
My life is just beginin'
I won't go huntin' with you Jake
But I'll go chasin' women
Now go wash your face and comb your hair
'Cause it's durn near time to start
But let me tell you 'fore you go
There's one that's got my heart
Don't chase that gal with the yaller hair
And wears a dress of green
For that little gal belongs to me
I know she's past sixteen
Oh I won't go huntin' with you Jake
But I'll go chasin' women
So put them hounds back in the pens
And quit your silly grinin'
Well the moon is bright and I'm half tight
My life is just beginin'
I won't go huntin' with you Jake
But I'll go chasin' women
Now I was headed for the general store
When a silly thing I seen
They make 'em in the city
It's called a magazine
I turned to page thirtytwo
And look at what I found
Them gals wear clothes that we ain't seen
Beneath them gingham gowns
Oh I won't go huntin' with you Jake
But I'll go chasin' women
So put them hounds back in the pens
And quit your silly grinin'
Well the moon is bright and I'm half tight
My life is just beginin'
I won't go huntin' with you Jake
But I'll go chasin' women <start> Your mama thinks I'm lazy
Your daddy runs down my name
But you said you'd love me
Come sunshine or come rain
Well I'll hold you to it Julie
Don't you fret and pout
This story has a happy ending
Even though for now
Chorus
This Romeo ain't got Julie yet
I love you so and you can bet
I'd follow you to Timbuktu
Like Scarlett followed Rhett
But this Romeo ain't got Julie yet
Just meet me 'round the old man's
Barn 'bout ten o'clock tonight
I'll have my Chevy humming
And take you for a ride
Throw the dog a big ol' bone
And make sure your bags are packed
We're headed for that silver moon
And may never come back
Chorus <start> 
Come on you no good worthless piece of foreign...

Wait till I get me a royalty check
I'm gonna buy me an American made car
Piece of junk
People always shout obscenities
When I stall in their lane
They're all convinced when they see me driving this heap that I'm insane
But seat belted in
I push the gas down fearlessly
Breaks stop working then
I watch the engine overheat
I need a new car
I can't ever get far
This one breaks down on me all the time
It's got four bald tires
And it always backfires
And I'm sick of that check engine light
I need a new car
I replaced all the cables and hoses
Had grease all over my face
For a couple weekends I had parts thrown all over the place
I put it back together fast
But now it's even worse
Now my friends just laugh
Cause it only goes in reverse
I need a new car
Getting to work's hard
When you have to drive backwards all the time
I'd find a junkyard and I'd sell it for parts
But I know they won't give me a dime
I need a new car
I won't repair anymore
Now the dang transmission's about to fall out
The only thought that's on my brain is the new car
I could be driving now
Rumor is they're having a sale over at the push pull or drag car lot
If I can get this towed down there I swear I'll take anything they've got
So with a credit line of  plus
No interest or money down and no more taking the bus
I got a new car
Looking like a big star
I don't care if the price is too high
It's got a VCR cruise control and Onstar
So I know where I'm at all the time
I got a new car
He got a new car <start> Meet me at the altar kneel with me in prayer
Side by side at the altar the one who knows is waiting there
What the Lord has joined together Satan tries to part
But let no man put asunder I know there's true love in our hearts
Meet me at the altar
Let us be forever faithful forget the past and all we've done
I know if we're ever faithful our two hearts will be as one
Meet me at the altar <start> I can hear those lonesome midnight sighs in your sleep
I can hear the freight train's whistle cry it's tellin' me
It's telling me oh darlin' can't you see
Here comes that same old line here comes goodbye
Here comes goodbye tonight
Put a hold on all your lies it's just not right
It comes as no surprise this time
Any fool would realize here comes goodbye
Better take some time to talk it over again with me
Better get all your things together now if you leave
It's killin' me oh darlin' can't you see
Here comes that same old line here comes goodbye
Here comes goodbye tonight
Put a hold on all your lies it's just not right
It comes as no surprise this time
Any fool would realize here comes goodbye
I can hear your footsteps movin' slowly across my floor
I can see your shadow look back at me outside my door
What'cha waitin' for Oh darlin' I know for sure
Here comes that same old line here comes goodbye
Here comes goodbye tonight
Put a hold on all your lies it's just not right
It comes as no surprise this time
Any fool would realize here comes goodbye
Any fool would realize here comes goodbye <start> I remember saying I don't care either way
Just as long as he or she is healthy I'm ok
Then the doctor pointed to the corner of the screen
And said You see that thing right there well you know what that means
And I started wondering who he was going to be
And I thought heaven help us if he's anything like me
He'll probably climb a tree too tall and ride hes bike to fast
End up every summer wearing something in a cast
He's gonna throw a ball and break some glass in a window down the street
He's gonna get in trouble oh he's gonna get in fights
I'm gonna lose my temper and some sleep
It's safe to say that I'm gonna get my payback if he's anything like me
I can see him right now knees all skinned up
With a magnifying glass trying to melt a Tonka truck
Won't he be a sight with his football helmet on
That'll be his first love til his first love comes along
He'll get his heart broke by the time he's in his teens
And heaven help him if he's anything like me
He'll probably stay out too late and drive his car too fast
Get a speeding ticket he'll pay for mowing grass
He's gonna get caught skipping class and be grounded for a week
He's gonna get in trouble we're gonna get in fights
I'm gonna lose my temper and some sleep
It's safe to say that I'm gonna get my payback if he's anything like me <start> I wonder if I'll ever forget you
And if our love that's true ever dies
I can't forget the kisses you gave me
Or memories of your two baby blue eyes
I'll always keep a memory of you
Visions of eyes as blue as the sky
And that's why each night there's tears on my pillow
I'm dreaming of your two baby blue eyes
Now when day is done and shadows are fallen'
My love will sleep 'til morning sunrise
I lay awake just tossing and turning
I'm longing for dreams of baby blue eyes
Now day after day try to keep smiling
And a broken heart I try to disguise
Now night after night my lonely heart's calling
It's calling for you my baby blue eyes <start> Oh jealous me and careless you
The odds were just too great
I couldn't stand those lonely nights
You made me sit and wait
But I'd thought I'd seen the last of you
When you walked out of site
Instead I see you in my dreams each night
Oh the key's in the mailbox come on in
I'm sitting here wishin' dear I'd have your love again
And I'll never even ask you where you've been
The keys in the mailbox come on in
Well I said I'd rather stay alone
Than share your company
I said don't come around at all
If you want more than me
But sitting here alone I can't deny the flame that burns
And I'd gladly take you back on any terms <start> Well it's lonesome in this ol' town everybody puts me down
I'm a face without a name just a walking in the rain
A going back to Houston Houston Houston
I got holes in both of my shoes well I'm a walking case of the blues
Saw a dollar yesterday but the wind blew it away
A going back to Houston Houston Houston
I haven't eaten in about a week I'm so hungry when I walk I squeak
Nobody calls me friend it's sad the shape I'm in
A going back to Houston Houston Houston
A going back to Houston Houston Houston
I got a girl waitin' there for me well at least she said she'd be
I got a home and big warm bed and a feather pillow for my head
A going back to Houston Houston Houston
Well it's lonesome in this ol' town
A going back to Houston Houston Houston <start> I was a rover on land and on sea till a good woman's love made a new man of me
Life had no meaning it was so incomplete
Till a good woman's love put me back on my feet
Stead of roamin' I go home in the evening she's waiting there
And no matter what happens I know she'll always care
And when the night falls and the moon shines above
I go home to a dream and a good woman's love
 mandolin 
Stead of roamin'...
I go home to a dream and a good woman's love <start> You'll find me hangin' around
It's there I'll be found
Down on the corner of love
Beneath the stars that shine
And the neon signs
I'll be down on the corner of love
When night starts to fall
And love starts to call
Down on the corner of love
You'll find me hangin' around
It's there I'll be found
Down on the corner of love
When it's late in the eve'nins
And I can't help but feelin'
That my heart you're a steelin'
'Neath the stars up above
When the sun goes down
And the moon comes 'round
I'll be down on the corner of love
Instrumental
When you're passin' by
Too lonesome to cry
Down on the corner of love
Just stop for a while
I'll teach you to smile
Down on the corner of love
A love that you had
Has treated you bad
Down on the corner of love
Forget what you knew
We'll start live anew
Down on the corner of love
When it's late in the eve'nins
And I can't help but feelin'
That my heart you're a steelin'
'Neath the stars up above
When the sun goes down
And the moon comes 'round
I'll be down on the corner of love
Instrumental <start> I'm sitting here inside this stranger's place
And time is racing by
I've been way out here for a month or more
Tonight I'm wondering why
You try to understand the things that I feel
Maybe this time I'll find a way to explain it
Cause there is a dream deep inside my head
And it may seem like it's breaking the thread
That holds me to you
Still you have never wanted to change me
But darling I know though we're far apart
The signal is strong
This helpless heart will always belong to you
To you
This power takes me from the place I belong
To where only the strong get through
You've got keep on believing or you'll lose your way
Cause it slips right out of view
Though there are days the light can flicker and fade
Here in this place tonight a fire is burning
Cause there is a dream deep inside my head
And it may seem like it's breaking the thread
That holds me to you
Still you have never wanted to change me
But believe me I know though we're far apart
The signal is strong
This helpless heart will always belong to you <start> You gotta walk that lonesome valley you gotta go there by yourself
There's no one here can go there with you you gotta go there by yourself
Mother said while she was dying and her breath was almost gone
Keep your trust in the Holy Bible it will guide you safely home
You gotta walk
If you cannot sing like angels if you cannot preach like Paul
You can tell the love of Jesus you can tell he died for all
You gotta walk <start> Bitin' my fingernails thinking of you don't love nobody else it's funny but it's true
Just got a feeling maybe we're through
Bitin' my fingernails and thinking dear of you
You really got me worried now I must confess it's true
I sit around twiddlin' my thumbs breaking my heart in two
I'm wondering if you love me so the way you say you do
I'm bitin' my fingernails and thinking dear of you
Bitin' my fingernails
If you have plans to end it all I wish you'd tell me now
Don't leave me thinking that someday you'd leave me anyhow
For I'll forget we ever met and find somebody new
I'm bitin' my fingernails and thinking dear of you
Bitin' my fingernails <start> Yep she finally crossed over love's cheatin' line
If she mean to hurt me she's done it this time
My best friend has loved her right out of my mind
She's finally crossed over love's cheatin' line
Yep she finally crossed over lovers cheatin' line
It's hard to imagine that I've been so blind
Well nobody could have told me that she was that kind
She finally crossed over lover's cheating line
Now listen to me girl it's true that I left her left her alone
And some folks will tell you i done her wrong
And I see the pity from all of my friends
It's hard to believe Lord the way true love ends
She finally crossed over love's cheatin' line
Guess I should have noticed those old danger signs
This bottles gonna help me to get her off my mind
She finally crossed over love's cheatin' line <start> I got my first motorcycle when I turned sixteen
I remember my mama raisin' cane with me
She said Son tell me why you want to ride that thing
She didn't know about the blond at the Dairy Queen
I got my own reasons why I do what I do
I like to ride motorcycles
She likes it too
I like to ride motorcycles
She likes it too
I always wore my hair just a little too long
Daddy didn't like it and he made no bones
If I'd have gotten it cut like he wanted me to
She wouldn't have had nothin' left to run her fingers through
I got my own reasons why I do what I do
I like to wear my hair long
She likes it too
I like to wear my hair long
She likes it too
I remember ridin' around with my buddies back home
Listenin' to some Country on the radio
When they tried to change the station to some Rock 'n' Roll
I'd turn the Opry up just as loud as it would go
I got my own reasons why I do what I do
I like Country music
She likes it too
I like Country music
She likes it too
Now I got a big Harley
And my hair is still long
And I'm still listening to a Country song
I got my own reasons
Why I do what I do
I know what I like
She likes it too
I know what I like
She likes it too
Yeah I know what I like
And she likes it too <start> 
November's almost over
The gentle winter's on the way.
Still I sit here on this balcony
And smoke my brain away
Waiting on that phone to ring.
Wondering which day that it will be.

Oh Carrie I pray one day you'll go back home
To the warmth of Southern Georgia where you belong
And leave all the pain you've felt from me
Here in Missouri.

Oh you were just a young girl
And I swore I could change.
Every day that you forgive me
Is just another one you'll waste.
You came here in search of something true.
I  your searching isn't through.


It's hard to think that everything around her.
To know that won't be happy ever after.
 <start> I've seen it going around when you get bad news
Thinking that you found a darker shade of blues
Looking for the light and it's a long way back
You know without a fight you're gonna fade to black
Never was a man that ever felt this way
One who couldn't live to see another day
Hard times seem to have the corner on you
But you can rise from the ashes too
When I'm on my knees and everything has gotten me beat
And even I believe I'm never gonna find my feet
Two ways you can go you can ask anybody around
One man's half way up is another man's half way down
Now you may decide it's a losing game
Even in your stride you're gonna call it lame
Getting one leg up when it's said and done
Is the hardest part no matter how you run
If you can walk away from a crash and burn
You'll appreciate every step you earn
And if you feel the ground is gaining on you
You're already bound to take a different view
When I'm on my knees and everything has gotten me beat
And even I believe I'm never gonna find my feet
Two ways you can go you can ask anybody around
One man's half way up is another man's half way down
One man's ceiling is another man's floor
One man's wall could be another man's door
One man's smile is another man's frown
And there are miles of half way up or half way down <start> We were waiting at the church we watched and saw the weddin' start
As the organ played we stood there and prayed just me and my broken heart
So can't you see that you have done to me oh foolish foolish pride
You brought tears and sorrow too an untrue heart that never cried
 steel 
I saw the sunshine of my life who once I know just worshipped me
Standing by another's side and soon his bride she'll be
I bowed my head in grief and shame as I felt the teardrops start
But as the organ played we stood there and prayed just me and my broken heart <start> Written by billy burnette.
I'm always wondering about you babe
Bout all the times you've walked away
And I'll always miss you when you go
Cause the way I feel well you just don't know
Let's head on down the road together
Where the air I'd clean and there's love and sunny weather
We'll hide away in our fields of green by a winding stream
In our world of make believe
It's just that look that's in your eyes
Something about you I idealize
I feel as though I'm bout to lose my mind
Just trying to catch up but I'm so far behind <start> I got all the time I could work right here in my head
I can come and go as I please you always understand
I guess I should be happy don't even know how all this began
I wish we cared enough to fight about it every now and then
What I want and what I have are two different things
What you were is not what you've become
We've lost so much inbetween
What I wanted and what I had are two different things
Honey turn that record off and put your car keys on the table
You know I can't tell you everything but I'll say what I'm able
Always tried to please you and I'll try it once again
The more I change the things I do the less you let me in
What you want and what I am are two different things
What I was is not what I've become
We've lost so much inbetween
What you wanted and what I am are two different things
Well there it is it's on the table we said all there is to say
You keep the name and the number you let me go I'll let you stay
'Cause what we wanted and what we had are two different things
What we were is not what we've become
We've lost so much inbetween
What we wanted and what we had are two different things
What we wanted and what we had are two different things <start> Baby dance with me slow
Let me fly with you
While the band plays low
Till the night is through
The lights of the candles
Look like stars around the room
I'll try to be careful
But I know I'm not immune
'cause I just can't imagine
How I'd ever come to harm
With this feeling that I'm feeling
As I'm drowning in your arms
Baby dance with me slow
Till we barely move
Let that crowd rock and roll
While we share this groove
And float like two shadows
In and out and in between
Those faces around us
At the edges of this dream
And it won't even matter
If they stare as we go by
I'm aware of only your love
In this world of you and I
Baby dance with me slow
Let me fly with you
Let me fly with you <start> I've seen you outside my window.
It's those dark seeds that bring you in.
I don't know if its hunger or habit
But I'm big on the idea of sin.
And you will sing in my meadow.
And you will sing in my home.
I'll be the one out there listening
And you'll be the one here all alone.
I've seen you outside my window
Breaking bread with the grackles and doves.
I don't know if its fear or anger
But I'm big on the idea of love.
And you will sing in my meadow.
And you will sing in my home.
I'll be the one out there listening
And you'll be the one here all alone.
I've seen you outside my window.
It's those dark needs that bring you out.
I don't know if it's faith or habit
But I'm big on the idea of doubt.
And you will sing in my meadow.
And you will sing in my home.
I'll be the one out there listening
And you'll be the one here all alone <start>  Bill 
There's a circle in a triangle it's a shining little band of gold
 Mary Lou 
You're the one who put it on her finger
 Bill 
Yeah but it's your hand I long to hold
That tiny circle it's the tie that binds me
 Mary Lou 
It's there to remind me you'll never be mine
 Both 
For that circle in a triangle three hearts in a tangle that'll never unwind
 Both 
I love you  I want you 
I need you  my whole life through
But there's a circle in a triangle three hearts in a tangle hers yours and mine
I love you ...
Three hearts in a tangle that'll never unwind <start> Your walls are lines with pictures of your triumphs through the years
Your doors is bolted tight against all wordly want and fear
But you left your passion and your pain with your first love back in school
You fool you fool
In your penthouse high from the dirty streets I swear you'll never find
The answers to the questions that muddy up your mind
For your window shades are drawn upon the wicked and the cruel
You fool you fool
You give your share the charity without a second thought
And you are kind to animals for that's what you've been taught
But all your real emotion you proudly overrule
You fool you fool
You've planned your life so carefully for society's delight
And still you can't quite understand why things just don't seem right
It's a love like fresh out homemade bread will sat aside to cool
You fool you fool you fool <start> You say he don't treat you right
You say it ain't the same
Spends all his time playing your heart like it's just a game
He should've never let you go
Now I got a real good reason
To let you know I wanna hold you close and pick up the pieces
You don't have to be alone tonight
Why you sitting at home tonight
Waiting for him to call you up at midnight drunk
To tell you that he wants you
Let's get out of town tonight
Get lost and found tonight
'Til you don't care let me love you right
Let's go somewhere where you and I
Can be all alone tonight
I wanna see your face
And whisper in your ear
I'm gonna say all the little things
You've been wanting to hear
You don't have to be alone tonight
Why you sitting at home tonight
Waiting for him to call you up at midnight drunk
To tell you that he wants you
Let's get out of town tonight
Get lost and found tonight
'Til you don't care let me love you right
Let's go somewhere where you and I
Can be all alone tonight
Be all alone tonight
You don't have to be alone tonight
I want you for my own tonight
Girl you don't have to be alone tonight
Why you sitting at home tonight
Waiting for him to call you up at midnight drunk
To tell you that he wants you
Let's get out of town tonight
Get lost and found tonight
'Til you don't care let me love you right
Let's go somewhere where you and I
Can be all alone tonight
Be all alone tonight <start> When I received your letter you were down and out you say
At first I thought I would tell you just to travel on the other way
But in my memory lingers all you once were to me
And I'm going to give you another chance to prove what you can be
Any old time you want to come back home
Just write me a line and say no more you'll roam
You'll have your chance to play the game fair
When you left me sweetheart you only left a load of care
Now that you're down I'm going to stick by you
If you'll only say that your roaming days are through
You'll find me here like the day you left me alone
Any old time you want to come back home
Now that you're down I'm going to stick by you
If you'll only say that your roaming days are through
And you'll find me here like the day you left me alone
Any old time you want to come back home <start> I've got the western stars to guide me
Dixie Sweet and low all night low
I can hear those fiddles high above me
A woman smiles as I sing my song
I've stood in line I've earned my keep
And I know she'll cry when I'm gone
A neon sign calls me to sleep
But I'm wide awake so I roll on
Chorus
Travelin' man ride as far as I can stand
My momma cries for the life I choose
And I need a beer but it's too damn far away from here
And I don't have time to sing the blues
I know I drink more than I should
But I can't slow down for my destiny
Lord knows I'd stop if I could
But the saints of old lift their glass to me <start> 
Being born was the worse and the first mistake I ever made
The doctor didn't spank me he just slapped me in the face
And the cup of love was always quenching someone else's thirst
Leaving me to swallow the bitter taste of hurt
'Cause I was raised an orphan
Never wanted as a kid until the year I turned 
Then everybody did strangers pass me back and forth
Men just took me as they pleased
And others had a Cinderella slave to cook and clean and weep
Though the deck is stacked against you
Win or lose you have to play
The hand a life has dealt you
And It's a gamble either way
On a dust road at  in a yellow cotton dress
With the desert sun like an angry dragon breathing down my neck
And the dry cracked plains would make me think of a prehistoric time
Or should I fear what lay before me less than what I'd left behind
A  year old girl don't have no trouble hitching rides
But sometimes when you're riding free
You'll pay the highest price
On back roads and in back seats
And in a cheap highway motel
But what's a few more strangers in a life of nothing else
Though the deck is stacked against you
Win or lose you have to play
The hand a life has dealt you
And It's a gamble either way
 caught me crying underneath the scarlet light
On the door steps of a stranger on a cold and rainy night
When I walked into the parlour here
Other pieces seemed to fit
I was good at pleasing strangers
So I made the most of it
Either way it's all a gamble
So view the stakes and know the odds
And lay your cards upon the table
Do all the dealing from the top
Though the deck is stacked against you
Win or lose you have to play
The hand a life has dealt you
And It's a gamble either way <start> My car broke down on our first date
We missed the movie an' we never ate
It was freezin' cold an' the heater broke.
I apologized you kissed me goodnight
An said It couldn't have been any better.
Girl if you like that you're gonna love forever.
If you like that ring you saw in the window
In the jewelery store down town.
If you like tuxedos an' white satin dresses
Maybe you better sit down.
If you like driftin' off to soft pillow talk
An wakin' up together
Girl if you like that you're gonna love forever.
If you like livin' on a rural route
Fixin' up an' old farmhouse.
Hugs with your coffee and your good mornin's with a kiss
If you like startin' a fire on a cold winter's night
An' makin' dreams come true together
Girl if you like that you're gonna love forever.
If you like that movie we saw last September
The one you cried half way through.
If you liked that scene where he got down on one knee
Girl have I got somethin' for you.
If you like love like wine that grows sweeter with time
An' keeps gettin' better an' better
Girl if you like that you're gonna love forever. <start> Turn on a neon light
At least make it feel like night
Put on some this or that
And maybe I won't feel so bad
Need a little background noise
To drown out this little voice
Running circles 'round my brain
Screaming louder than the pain
My head is spinning
My resolve is reeling
I can tell by the heavy in my heart
I'm going down soon
No use fighting the fight
It's no contest tonight
My figured out's never been more confused
Having mixed drinks about feelings and you
Turn off the bedroom light
Put on a brave face and face the night
It's either get used to this dread
Or the cold spot in our bed
The bottle helps but the memory burns
The whiskey soothes but I toss and turn
I'll find sleep 'til dreams relent
Wake up tired and try again
My head is spinning
My resolve is reeling
I can tell by the heavy in my heart
I'm going down soon
No use fighting the fight
It's no contest tonight
My figured out's never been more confused
Having mixed drinks about feelings and you
Having mixed drinks about feelings and you <start> Baby can't you feel that
Baby don't you hear that
That's the sound freedom calling our name
It's telling us that all we gotta do is turn the key
Let this feeling carry us away
Baby lets ride
Chase a little sunset
Watch that full moon rise
Baby lets ride
Find some road where there ain't no end in sight
Let the wheels of this RAM truck kick up a little dust while your holding on tight
Come on
Baby lets ride
Girl you know the night is young
No reason not to run
A few miles of memories down this road
Baby we don't need a map
Pick a star we'll follow that
What are we waitin on girl lets go
Baby lets ride
Chase a little sunset
Watch that full moon rise
Baby lets ride
Find some road where there ain't no end in sight
Let the wheels of this RAM truck kick up a little dust while your holding on tight
Come on
Baby lets ride
This is how you got me feelin right now
Baby lets ride
Don't look back it'll never come down
Let the wheels of this RAM truck kick up a little dust while your holding on tight
Come on
Baby lets ride <start> Go tell it on the mountain over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born
Go tell it on the mountain
The shepherds kept their watching over the sheep
Behold the light from heaven there shown a holy light
Go tell it on the mountain
Born this bright glorious morning Christ is born today
He came to redeem every sinner and he washed their sins away
Go tell it on the mountain
Go tell it on the mountain <start> If anyone asks you never saw me
And I know you know better than to call me
Let's just hide out under the covers
One more secret between two old lovers
What can it hurt
I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright I can quit
You're just someone that I'm tasting
I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse
I know I said I said it was over
But it's hard when I miss you to stay sober
So if I show up here at your door again
Oh it's just me falling off of the wagon
What can it hurt
I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright I can quit
You're just someone that I'm tasting
I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse
I can quit when I'm ready 
I ain't hurting nobody but me
I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright I can quit
You're just someone that I'm tasting
I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse
Oh no
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse <start> We've decided we can't work it out we might as well call it a day
We agree to disagree and go our seperate ways
We just don't seem to get along we're fightin' and we fuss
So we've agreed to part as friends is best for both of us.
But what's gonna happen to the little folks the little folks the little folks
What's gonna happen to the little folks who live in our house
Since we've decided we can't work it out we might as well ended this time
We fought enough and fussed enough and said too much this time
So we've agreed that the thing to do has set each other free
You'll go your way and I'll go mine that's best for you and me
But what's gonna happen to the little folks...
But maybe someday we'll look back and see how foolish we've been
Cause we might find just the little ones who'd lose in the end
But maybe things are not so bad we're still in love you and I
And maybe we can work it out if we give it one more try
We owe that much to the little folks the little folks the little folks
We owe that much to the little folks who live in our house <start> Satan Yer Kingdom Must Come Down
Satan yer kingdom must come down
Satan yer kingdom must come down
I heard the voice of Jesus say
Satan yer kingdom must come down
Shout til I tear your kingdom down
Shout til I tear your kingdom down
I heard the voice of Jesus say
Shout til I tear your kingdom down <start> And I love you so
The people ask me how
How I've lived till now
I tell them I don't know
I guess they understand
How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand
And yes I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me
And you loved me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
I'm happy that you do
The book of life is brief
And once a page is read
All but love is there
That is my belief
And yes I know how loveless life can be
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me
And I love you so
The people ask me how
How I've lived till now
I tell them I don't know <start>  count Intro
I turned sixteen got a brand new sixstring
Haggard and Hank Sting and Springsteen
Peelin' the paint every chance I got.
Daddy said You're pretty good but it's tough out there
Now 'Stairway To Heaven' won't get ya anywhere
Otta cut your hair and get a real job.
Chorus 
So I started a band and we got out of dodge
In a Dodge van with no exhaust
Got high off the fumes but we played our tunes
Ain't no one gonna say I can't
Yeah I started a band stared a band.
Started a band and I met a girl
Sang my songs and rocked her world
Goin' strong but out of the blue one day
She said I can't love a music man
So I dropped my dream and sold my amp
But I'll be damned if she didn't leave me anyway.
Chorus 
So I stared a band with a couple new guys
We played those same ol' dives.
Yeah we never sold gold okay we never sold
Ain't no one gonna say I can't
Yeah I started a band started a band
But the lead picker always played too loud
And him and the drummer had a fallin' out
Bass man stayed out of it and just got drunk
I was Nashville bound my dreams were bigger
I knocked 'em out they just couldn't pull the trigger
And that's Nashville speak for I stunk as a solo man.
Chorus 
So I started a band we play what we like
On a stage that's eight feet wide
But I got my pride and I got my van
I kept who I am I started a band
Started a band can't get this guitar out my hand
Yeah I started a band. <start> THE WONDERS YOU PERFORM

Oh Lord you know that I'm not one to bother you with little thiings
And you and I have never been toooo close
But we've always been on speakin' terms
I've watched you with doin' things
And tried to understand you more than most
No I haven't gone to church the way I ought to
But I always thought you knew in my own way I worshipped you
While even your own children doubt and fail to understand
The simple way you go about the things you do
I've seen the doubt upon the face of loved ones
As they sadly placed a wreath of flowers on a tiny grave
And wondered why a child is brought into the world
To only live a little while and die you could have saved
But I believe that in your eyes this little child was somethin' special
And you wanted it to be with you no doubt
So with outstretched arms you beckoned it so simple that I reckon
They can't understand the way you worked it out
Once I saw a young man growin' till he neared the age of knowin'
Then I watched as somethin' happened to his mind
No doctor could correct it it was just as I suspected
And I marvelled at your way of bein' kind
They tried everything in vain and I was there when they explained it
To the family how he slipped into a trance
Guess you looked into the future watched him turn his back upon you
Lovin' him so much you couldn't take the chance
It took a lot of love to die for sinners such as I
And I guess that's why you've never given up on me
You understood when some denied you and even when they crucified you
Knowin' all these things were meant to beee
For the stable's such a simple thing no wonder there were few who came
To see a king the night that you were born
And I'd ask one favor if I can help me to better understand
The mystery of the wonders You perform Amen <start> Through the years with you I have often fallen
I've been every kind of fool a man can be
For I never had control of a devil in my soul but somehow you never did give up on me
When I couldn't keep a word I struck at you in my hunger for things I didn't need
When I could need a break or bend you were there to be my friend
And somehow you never did give up on me
And I'm proud to know God gave me such a woman
Who had eyes to see the good somewhere in me
Without you my life would only be a ruin but somehow you never did give up on me
 steel  guitar 
And I'm proud to know... <start> Well I came from Alabama
With a banjo on my knee
I'm goin' to Louisiana
My true love for to see
It had rained all night the day I left
The weather it was dry
The son so hot I froze to death
Susanna don't you cry
I got a long way to go
I sure feel it now
Deep down in these dusty clothes
Through another town
Backed up with capricious souls
I got a long way to go
I got a lot left to say
To the empty seat
The stood beside me through the fray
To the midnight moon
who saw it fit to light my way
I got a lot left to say
Chorus
But where do I got from here
When I'm lost out on the road
And the way's not clear
To find my way back home
I need to hear
The only voice that leads me on
So I can find my way back to you
I had a dream the other night
When everything was still
I thought I saw Susanna
Comin' down the hill
A buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye
says I'm comin' from the south
Susanna don't you cry
Repeat Chorus
Soon we'll be in New Orleans
Then I'll look around
And when I find Susanna
I'll fall down on the ground
And if I do not find her
Then I shall surley die
And when I'm dead and buried
Susanna Don't you cry for me <start> All the years I've gone through my life
Taking the fall just to make it alright
A time and place never could erase
The day we met
You can't make me stay
I wouldn't anyway
'Cause it don't feel right
When it's said and done
You can't hold on to the light
If it don't feel right
Yeah I'm OK but I'm not the same
And I take it in stride
There's no way to lose with pictures to prove
The lives we made
You didn't take a stand
You didn't hold my hand
You should have held on tight
When it's said and done
She's gonna run through the dead of night
If it don't feel right
Crimson pair we could make 'em stare
Oh but I slipped right down
I saw his face all time erased
But that don't make it right
You've got a thousand lines
You're going overtime
Just to change my mind
With so much to prove
Babe you're on the move it's a million miles
When it don't feel right <start> A two night stand in Tulsa pullin out an headed west
Freddie grabbed the Gideons from the hotel in the desk
An we said whats the matter brother Are you worried about your soul
He said better safe than sorry boys thats just how I role
We hit the road a feelin cool as Crosby Stills and Nash overflowin with the spirit an a bible on the dash
Well we pulled the whole thing over for the flashin reds and blues
The police come to the window and he said Have you heard the news
He said dont get smart with me boy why you doin 
my foot is heavy with redemption Im just blessed to be alive
He said I oughtta pull you out a there an beat you black and blue
I placed my hand upon the good book an said what would Jesus do
Its better than insurance registration or lyin
Its better than these fake IDs I have to keep buyin
Its even better than an envelope stuffed with cash
They always said itd save me that old bible on the daash
Well round these parts that hair alonell make probable cause
If youre movin through my county youll obey my earthly laws
Well we did our best to quote some holy red chapter or verse
what kinda music you boys makin
we said Christian music sir
well he thought about contemplated twirled his cop moustache
alright yalls be careful now just dont drive quite so fast
Its better than insurance registration or lyin
Its better than these fake IDs I keep on buyin
Its even better than an envelope stuffed with cash
They always said itd save me that old bible on the daash
.
Well crossin at the border a few months later we heard FREEZE
Pull in over there son we gonna do some search and seize.
Maybe if wed been more famous hed a said just move along
If hed a seen us on the TV if we'd had hit single songs
Well hes just about to ask us wheres the money guns and hash
Well Is prayin it would save me that ol bible on the dash
His hand was on his pistol his dog was on his leash
An that shepard he was a keeping a pretty close eye on the sheep
We got a list were gonna look at see if we cant find your names
We got parabolic laser beams hears everything you say
We got ultraviolet xrays that can see right through your bus
Yes sir well I hope the good lord keeps an eye on all of us yup
Its better than a green card its better than lyin
Its better than these work visas I keep on buyin
Its better than an envelope stuffed with cash
Lord Im at the border with a bible on the daash <start> That old wind that's whipping out there
It's whistlin' your tune
That wind blew pyramids to Egypt
And footprints to the moon
And that old star that you been wishin' on
Is shinin' mighty bright
But it's the fire inside your heart
That's gonna lead you to the light
How you ever gonna know
What it's like to live there
How you ever gonna know victory
How you ever gonna know
What it's like when dreams become reality
How you ever gonna know
How it feels to hold her
How you ever gonna know
What it's like to dance
How you ever gonna know
If you never take a chance
You know failure isn't failure
If a lesson from it's learned
I guess love would not be love
Without a risk of being burned
Anything in life worth havin'
Lord it has its sacrifice
But the gift that you're receiving
Is worth more than a price
How you ever gonna know
What it's like to live there
How you ever gonna know
What you never knew
How you ever gonna know
If you're down here doin'
What the good Lord put you here to do
How you ever gonna know
If you could have done it
How you ever gonna know
How it feels to fly
How you ever gonna know
If you never dare to try
Listen not to the critics
Who put their own dreams on the shelf
If you want to get the truth to admit it
You gotta find out for yourself
How you ever gonna know
What it's like to be there
How you ever gonna know
If you're the best
How you ever gonna know
What you believe in
If you don't put it to the test
How you ever gonna know
How it feels to hold him
How you ever gonna know
What livin' means
How you ever gonna know
If you never chase the dreams
How you ever gonna know
Your potential
How you ever gonna know victory
How you ever gonna know
What it's like when dreams become reality
How you ever gonna know
How it feels to hold her
How you ever gonna know
What it's like to dance
How you ever gonna know
If you never take a chance <start> I swore the last time that you let me down
That I wouldn't see you if you came around
But I can't tell my heart what's right or wrong
And I've been so lonely since you've been gone
You've got me under your spell again
Saying those things again
Making me believe you're just mine
You've got dreaming those dreams again
Thinking those things again
I've gotta take you back just one more time
Everybody tells me that I'm a fool
That I never should have put my faith in you
And way down deep inside I guess I know it's true
But no one else can make me feel the way you do
You've got me under your spell again
Yes I've gotta take you back just one more time <start> I'd like to make everyday with you a holiday for love
Every hour of the day you're all I'm a thinkin' of
All week along when you're gone I sit around so blue
I just can't wait on Saturday that's my holiday with you
Monday Tuesday Wednesday wonder if you miss me too
Thursday Friday Saturday making plans just to be with you
Oh I'm a gonna be so sweet to you neath the moon above
I'd like to make everyday with you a holiday for love
Well I'd like to make everyday with you...
I'd like to make everyday with you a holiday for love <start> 
Bartender won't you pour me a very strong drink
Just keep it coming till I don't have to think
And point out some cowboy that might want to dance
And make sure I get home if you see that I can't
You see I loved him he left me for a girl half my age
I relate to each sad song that ole jukebox has played
I listen to Haggard ole Hank and George Jones
But why don't more women sing honky tonk songs
Why don't more women sing honkytonk songs
About the heartaches and the tough breaks
And the men that's done 'em wrong
There are others just like me that are hurtin' to the bone
So why don't more women sing honkytonk songs
Why don't more women sing honky tonk songs
Honky tonk angels are just queens without thrones
Judge not lest you be judged who can cast the first stone
Why don't more women sing honkytonk songs
Bartender won't you pour me a very strong drink
Just keep it coming till I don't have to think
And point out some cowboy that might want to dance
And make sure I get home if you see that I can't

Why don't more women sing honky tonk songs
About the heartaches and the tough breaks
And all the men that's done us wrong
There's a whole lotta women I know would sing along
So why don't more women sing honky tonk songs
Why don't more women sing honky tonk songs <start> MY WHOLE WORLD IS FALLING DOWN

' Stallion Music
RECORDED BY CONNIE SMITH AND BY BRENDA LEE
My whole world is a falling down falling down falling down
My whole world is a falling down I'm losin' my baby
You told me that your love for me was true
Said you would love me your whole life through
But now you're asking me to set you free
You found somebody you love more than me
My whole world is a falling down...
Where did she come from what's her name
What did she do to set your heart a flame
I'm all alone while she's with you
You're having fun my heart's breaking in two
My whole world is a falling down...
I miss your loving that was so fine
I need it I need it oh all the time
I still love you in the same old way
But I'm losin' you a little more every day
My whole world is a falling down...
My whole world is a falling down... <start> All the way to Jericho in a rusted automobile
if you could only find out anyway you oughta feel
all the way to Jericho in a rusted auto
lookin at the yellow moonwaitin for the northern star
All the way to Jericho it doesn't even seem that real
knowin' that the time is gonenuthin' left to save or steal
All the way to Jericho all the while singin' low
wishin for a passengerwaiting for that northern star
All the way to Jericho in a rusted automobile
mighta missed a sign you saw farm roadcorn field
say goodbye to Jericho lookin at the book of dreams
how to get to Bethlehemtime to get some gasoline
And when you see that starry night
or a cross up on a hill
then you wait for early light
to take yer hands off the wheel
when you see that starry night <start> The moon is shinnin' down through the pines
And it spreads its light across the mountain side
And I wonder what you're doin' tonight
Yes I wonder what you're doin' and I wonder if everythings alright
Well I'm up on this mountain and you're there in town
Sleepin' in your feather bed and I'm layin' on the ground
I never knew that I could feel so lost and all alone
And singin' such a lonesome cowboy song
Well I'm just a cowboy I'm workin' all day long
At night I eat my beef and beans and then I sing this song
Yes I wonder what you're doin' tonight
Yes I wonder what you're doin' and I wonder if everthing's all right
Well I'm up on this mountain...
Now them calves are bawlin' and I can't get no rest
That cold wind's a blowin' and I'm freezin' half to death
Yes I wonder what you're doin' tonight
Yes I wonder what you're doin' and I wonder if everthing's all right
Well I'm up on this mountain...
It won't be long now and I'll be comin' down
And I better not find any rednecks hangin' round
Yes I wonder what you're doin' tonight
Yes I wonder what you're doin' and I wonder if everthing's all right
Well I'm up on this mountain... <start> There's music in the city
And the lights are on display
There's a big old tree for all to see
Where the children run and play
I look out through my window
Somethin' just don't seem right
TiIl I said hello and heard her voice
On the other end of the line
Now it's Christmas Christmas I'm hurrying' on my way
Christmas Christmas like I'm riding in a one horse sleigh
Well I don't have to hear no jingle bells just the ringing of the phone
Mama just called and said it's time
For me to come home
The pies are in the oven
You can almost taste the air
And it warms my heart to feel her love
And know how much she cares
It's funny how going back can get you back where you belong
It's the difference between in just a melody and my favorite Christmas song <start> You snap your fingers and just like that I'm back in your hands
I cried a river washin' your mem'ry away
And I finally made it at least till you phoned me today
And I nearly hung up but teardrops destroyed my plan
You snap your fingers and just like that I'm back in your hands
You snap your fingers and just like that I'm back in your hands
Startin' all over right back where I've always been
And I'm just beginnin' to learn some things never end
You snap your fingers and just like that I'm back in your hands
 steel 
And I'm just beginnin'...
You snap your fingers and just like that I'm back in your hands <start> We touched the sun
We held the stars
We fell in love with open hearts
We chased our dreams
That went beyond
We did it all
We touched the sun
When I look back I'm glad we found each other
With no regrets along the way
And what was like and endless summer
Its just yesterday
And even if its not forever
We were meant to be together
Even if its only for a while
We touched the sun
We held the stars
We fell in love with open hearts
We chased our dreams
That went beyond
We did it all
We touched the sun <start> Be glad you've got what you've got when you've got it
Or you're gonna find out what you've got is gone
Make sure you know what you know when you know it
Or before you know it you'll be all alone
Take care when you do what you do if you do it
If you don't you won't have your baby long
Be glad you've got what you've got when you've got it
Or you're gonna find that what you've got is gone
Now everybody envies you you lucky so and so
You should thank your lucky stars above
Good buddy what she sees in you I guess I'll never know
But it's a wonder that you still have her love
Be glad you've got what you've got...
You'd better treat her better and you'd better start right now
She deserves the best that you can do
She does everything for you the best that she knows how
And that's the least she can expect from you
So be glad you've got what you've got...
Or you're gonna find that what you've got is gone <start> The closer you get the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get the further I fall
Could I be dreamin'
Is this really real
'Cause there's something magic
The way that I feel in your arms here tonight
The closer you get the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get the further I fall
Keep fallin' oh yeah yeah keep fallin' mm fallin' oh yeah yeah I'm fallin'
Yes I'm fallin' 
Yes I'm fallin' 
Yes we're fallin' 
The closer you get oh baby the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get the further I fall <start> Well Lordy mercy I's in a mess
My wife run off with my TV set
Didn't bother me none that she had to go
'Cept I's gonna miss all my TV shows.
So I looked up to heaven got down on my knees.
An' I cried Dear Lord will you help me please.
I need a TV by tomorrow night
Cause Rick Flair's involved in a title fight.
Well I guess my tytheing finally paid off
Cause early next mornin' shoulda seen what I saw.
Reached in my overhorse for my inhaler
Cause there's a big brown box there right in my trailer.
I used my truck keys cut open the box
I was hopin' for a Sony or a Magnavox.
I looked at the name and thought Oh my gosh
This must be a new one called Macintosh.
Well my last TV was a whole lot wider
But this'n here come with its own typewriter.
It had all the letters from A to Z
I guess you just type in what you wanna see.
Well I thought I punched up You done help
But the TV Screen said World Wide Web.
Then I broke out in a cold cold sweat
I's the first redneck on the internet.
He was the first red neck on the internet
A bona fide countrified cyberthreat.
He went on line just one time
And now they won't forget
The first redneck on the internet.
It was all so new I shoulda taken my time
But I slammed that mouse up in fourwheel drive.
Last time I did so much pointin' and clickin'
I had a . rifle shootin' at chickens.
Then all of a sudden it occurred to me
The power I had with this fancy TV.
I could get back at my exwife
With the touch of a button I could ruin her life.
So I got the number off her Mastercard
I bought a new lift kit and four new tires.
Then I got on line to her bank account
Went ahead and closed that sucker out.
I had her power and her water shut slap off.
The I sent an email to her dead plain boss
Lettin' him know that she told me
She'd have his job by the end of the week.
He was the first red neck on the internet
A bona fide countrified cyberthreat.
He went on line just one time
And now they'll never forget 
The first redneck on the internet.
Now the moral of the story as a matter of fact
In a couple of days I got my TV back.
She said she'd like to come back as well.
I told her to go straight to AOL.
Now thank the Lord that the UPS
For droppin' that box at Cledus' address.
If they ever wanna find him it won't take long
Type www.cledus.com
To reach the first red neck on the internet
A bona fide countrified cyberthreat.
He went on line just one time
And now they'll never forget 
He was the first red neck on the internet.
The first red neck on the internet.
Hey Buck p'preciate your help you are the man.
World Wide Web population four zillion. Cy hoot <start> I feel so sorry for my friends now that you'd left me
I just don't have the time to see them like I used to do
I know they worry but each night I hurry
To get home to my memories of you
I've got so many I've not lost any
Like treasure packed away they get me through
To fit my sad time I just go through my mind
And pick out the perfect memory of you
I don't feel lonely anymore that's what they don't see
There's so many happy thoughts of you that I can use
It's not real life but I know you're still mine
When I'm goin' through my memories of you
I've got so many I've not lost any
Like treasure packed away they get me through
To fit my sad time I just go through my mind
And pick out the perfect memory of you <start> They gave you a corner room on the fifth floor
The city lights were like candy to a kid in a store
Like a king you'd lay in your bed so statefully
So thankful they gave you a room with scenery
You always were so healthy so full of life
So seeing you so helpless just didn't seem right
And how you kept your head so high I'll never know
I guess you knew you had a better place to go
Now
You've got a room with a view
A window to the world
You always had your sights set high
And now that you're gone
Your memory lives on
And I see you smiling in my mind
With angels as visitors dropping by
Your room with a view
I'll always miss you
I'll always feel the loss
I have to remind myself that you're better off
I gotta believe even through these tears of mine
Wherever you are there's a sun that always shines
And
You've got a room with a view
A window to the world
You always had your sights set high
And now that you're gone
Your memory lives on
And I see you smiling in my mind
With angels as visitors dropping by
Your room with a view
With angels as visitors dropping by
Your room with a view
Hoah <start> There's no love left our love's beyond help
Why do we keep on tryin' when there's no love left
The feeling we felt for each other
For a long time now has been dying
We'd both be better off without each other
We can't bring it back to life why do we keep trying
There's no love left...
 steel  fiddle 
When love is gone it's gone and you can't bring it back
When the warm sun goes down it turns cold
We both might as well just accept the fact
There's nothing warm left for us to hold
There's no love left...
There's no love left... <start> We both said some things I know we never meant
And when I slammed the door tonight you wondered where I went.
If I know you you're probably wonderin' what to do.
You're thinkin' that I'm gone for good if I know you.
But if I know me I'll turn this car around.
I won't get halfway through town and I'll be sorry.
I'll stop and call and you'll say you're sorry too
And I'll come runnin' back to you if I know me.
Sometimes I lose my head say things to break your heart
Forgettin' if I lost your love it would tear my world apart.
If I know you you didn't mean one single thing you said.
Truth be known you're dyin' cryin' lyin' there in bed.
But if I know me I'll turn this car around.
I won't get halfway through town and I'll be sorry.
I'll stop and call and you'll say you're sorry too
And I'll come runnin' back to you if I know me. <start> DON'T KEEP ME LONELY TOO LONG

  ' Glad Music 
It sure gets lonely alone no one to talk to alone
Nights sure get longer since you've gone don't leave me lonely too long
I need your arms to hold me and hear you say you need me
Don't let me live on dreams alone don't keep me lonely too long
Mem'ries are bad for one so lonely
My tortured heart cries out because it loves and wants you only
Yes I'm too lonely alone afraid of being alone
Without your love I can't go on don't leave me lonely too long
Don't leave me lonely too long <start> Beautiful Star of Bethlehem

Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
Your back is straight your hair is smooth
On the pillow where you lie
I don't sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not to me
But to the stars above
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
Your daddy he's an outlaw
A wanderer by trade
He'll teach you how to pick and choose
And how to throw the blade
He oversees his kingdom
No stranger dare intrude
His voice it trembles as he calls
For another plate of food
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
Your sister sees the future
Like your mama and yourself
You've never learned to read or write
There's no books upon your shelf
Your pleasure knows no limits
Your voice is like a lark
But your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
Oh to the valley below <start> Superman  Superman  Superman
Now there you go pickin' on me again
Pushin' me to the very eeend
Tellin' me to move another mountain
Well just 'cause you can walk on water
And you know son I can
You know you're mamma should have named you Superman
Superman  Superman  Superman
Now let's go through this one more time
You do your thing and I'll do mine
Now honey baby you've gotta draw the line
Your hangup is messin' with mine
All I can do is the best I can
To change the ways that you can't stand
And if it ain't good enough for superman
He ain't good enough for me
Superman  Superman  Superman
So you don't have to rub it in
Just 'cause you're right and I'm wrong again
Sometimes right is just as wrong as wrong is
And I ain't never gonna learn how to make it plain
I wouldn't if I could for all the bull in Spain
But you go right ahead and do it do it Superman
Superman  Superman  Superman
Yeah let's go through this one more time
You do your thing and I'll do mine
But honey baby we gotta draw the line
Your hangup is messin' with mine
All I can do is the best I can
To change the ways that you can't stand
And if it ain't good enough for superman
He ain't good enough for mine <start> It's been a dead ass week at a dead end job
Got a boss on me like a snake on a frog
There's got to be more than what I've got
On this big ole piece of rock
I want a little umbrella and a patch of sand
Coconut drink and a reggae band
Just might be the place where I get off
Yeah I want a day in the life of a summertime song
Sail away with a Malibu rum
Sail on sail on away yeah
Let the scorching sun and the salt in the sea
Burn the skin right off of me
Come on everybody and sing along
It's a summertime song
I might pierce my ear and bleach my hair
And get a tattoo on my derriere
Right now I don't really care
What anybody else might think
I'm going to dance to every song I can
So I can show off my new island tan
While I wave my hand and raise my drink
'Cause I want a day in the life of a summertime song
Sail away with a Malibu rum
Sail on sail on away yeah
Let the scorching sun and the salt in the sea
Burn the skin right off of me
Come on everybody and sing along
It's a summertime song
Yeah I want a day in the life of a summertime song
Sail away with a Malibu rum
Sail on sail on away yeah
Let the scorching sun and the salt in the sea
Burn the skin right off of me
Come on everybody and sing along
It's a summertime song <start> Take me back Josephine
To that cold and dark December
I am missing someone but I don't know who
Now I'm standing alone and I'm trying to remember
Sometimes I wonder how I ever started loving you
Noontime wind can you blow
For me one more time
And take me on back to the start
Where the midnight moon shines so bright
Nearly pulled us up to Heaven
By the strings of our heart
Take me back Josephine
To that cold and dark December
I am missing someone but I don't know who
Now I'm standing alone and I'm trying to remember
Sometimes I wonder how I ever started loving you
Morning sun shine on me
Come light inside my window
And rest on my brow
Kiss my eyes when I sleep
And carry me back home
If my dreams will allow
Take me back Josephine
To that cold and dark December
I am missing someone but I don't know who
Now I'm standing alone and I'm trying to remember
Sometimes I wonder how I ever started loving you
Take me back Josephine
To that cold and dark December
I am missing someone but I don't know who
Now I'm standing alone and I'm trying to remember
Sometimes I wonder how I ever started loving you
Someone help me understand why I'm still loving you <start> Hey I'm a man I'm a guy I'm a dude
I'm a dose of double trouble if I get attitude
You can see I'm hard workin' by the sweat on my brow
If I don't know somethin' about it better bet I'll learn how
I been tattooed by a few battle scars
No I ain't somebody somebody can push too far
You're just a shade over five foot two
Oh but girl with just a look you get me shaking in my shoes
You say jump and I'll say how high
You say do and I don't ask why
You get a lock and baby I'll be the key
That's what loving you means to me
You toss the stick and baby I'll fetch it
You set the time and girl I'll stretch it
I'll be your everything from A to Z
That's what loving you means to me
Well I could live to be a hundred and I'll never understand
The mystifying power woman has over man
I could set my mind to walk across a bed of hot coals
But the thought of life without you makes my blood run cold
I remember declaring as a younger man
That there weren't a woman out there who could fence me in
But you got me wrapped up like a belt in a buckle
Down on my knees girl you got me crying uncle
You say jump and I'll say how high
You say do and I don't ask why
You get a lock and baby I'll be the key
That's what loving you means to me
You toss the stick and baby I'll fetch it
You set the time and girl I'll stretch it
I'll be your everything from A to Z
That's what loving you means to me
Well you got me wrapped up like a belt in a buckle
Down on my knees girl you got me crying uncle
You say jump and I'll say how high
You say do and I don't ask why
You get a lock and baby I'll be the key
That's what loving you means to me
You toss the stick and baby I'll fetch it
You set the time and girl I'll stretch it
And I'll be your everything from A to Z
That's what loving you means to me <start> She met him down at the laundry mat
Three a.m. on a washing machine they sat
And talked until dawn
He bought her breakfast at a small caf
Morning turned to the rest of the day
Then the day was gone
He thought that she'd surely run away
A fairy tale never started this way but
It ain't the mind that calls the shots round here
A stronger power's pulled to bodies near
Nothing on Earth can interfere
When love is what the heart wants
They made a wish on the evening star
From a rooftop high above the boulevard
Up in the twilight sky
He held her hand she held her breath
Two lonely hearts beating scared to death
Of a chance to fly
Giving in to the arms of fate
This isn't quite like the plans that they made but
It ain't the mind that calls the shots round here
A stronger power's pulled to bodies near
Nothing on Earth can interfere
When love is what the heart wants
It ain't the mind that calls the shots round here
A stronger power's pulled to bodies near
Nothing on Earth can interfere
When love is what the heart wants
It ain't the mind that calls the shots round here
A stronger power's pulled to bodies near
Nothing on Earth can interfere
When love is what the heart wants
Oh
Nothing on Earth can interfere
When love is <start> High as the sky is my love for you warm as the sun that comes shining through
Strong as a wave on the ocean blue that's how I measure my love for you
When I sleep all my dreams are just dreams of you
When I'm awake all my thoughts are of only you
I'd walk a mile just to see one little smile from you
That's how I measure my love for you
 steel 
When you're gone how I long for the sight of you
When you're near how I thrill to the touch of you
Right or wrong from now on I'll be a part of you
That's how I measure my love for you
High as the sky...
That's how I measure my love for you <start> Morning comes and I'm alone ...
It's been a year since you've been gone
But it seems like yesterday you said goodbye
I'm finding ways to pass the time so I won't lose my mind
But my every waking hour I think of you
That's just a day in the life of a fool
The one who's holding out for only you
Knowing all along your love for me is true
It's just a day in the life of a fool
You would think I'd learn by now  to forget it all some how .
But my favorite memories were made with you
So every moment that I have  I live them in the past
Even though theres no way back to where we were
That's just a day in the life of a fool
The one who's holding out for only you
Knowing all along your love for me is true <start> Let's get Ricky with it.
He's into aviation and scientology.
He's been my fascination ever since that movie Grease.
It's become an addiction I get the fever every Saturday night
For urban cowboy and pulp fiction boy in the bubble makes me cry.
Phenomenon and face off earned him critical acclaim.
I'd love to live his crazy life have his fortune and his fame
And a few of his old flames.
Hair blowed up way out livin' like John Travolta
Bee Gees turned up loud livin' like John Travolta
Buy my own leer jet if I wasn't so broka.
Known all over town livin' like John Travolta.
Wish I was john Travolta livin' like John Travolta Ah ah ah ahchoo
Tried to make it in New York city just like ole Johnny did
I got a part in a bad big movie that film was a piece of sh.
Welcome Back Kotter Barbarino was his name.
With Horshack Juan Washington those sweat hogs were insane
But I love him just the same.
But no. High school I dropped out livin' like john Travolta.
Put on a few pounds livin' like John Travolta.
Named my first son jeb my wife thinks I've gone loca
All I talk about is livin' like John Travolta
Wish I was john Travolta living like John Travolta.
His last name means high voltage
There's greased lightening in his pants.
Quentin Tarantino pulled his career out of the drain
Maybe he could do the same for me.
Pants legs flared way out. Livin' like john Travolta.
Burned the dance floor down living like john Travolta.
Films are never bound more hits than Sammy Sosa.
I am all about livin' like John Travolta
Wish I was John Travolta livin' like John Travolta. <start> She was waitin' tables in a diner off of Highway 
On his way to Indiana on another midnight run
So they talked about the weather and the next thing that you know
The hours flew by like minutes and it was time he had to go
On a rainy highway half way out of town
A voice inside his heart said turn those  wheels around
And go back
You've got somebody waitin'
Go back
That's where you need to be
Right now
There's nothing in this world more important than that
So go back
They settled down in a little house in the spring of '
And she quit her job at the diner with the baby almost due
Those early years weren't easy and they had bills to pay
So he said you know I hate to leave you but I'll be back by Saturday
 miles out of Tulsa his boss came on his radio
Said if you want to see your brand new daughter you better drop that load
And go back
You've got somebody waitin'
Go back
That's where you need to be
Right now
There's nothing in this world more important than that
So go back
Everybody heard the sirens
They pulled his rig out of the snow
In a rush to see his family somehow he lost control
Though the doctors tried to save him he slipped into the light
Then he heard the angels whisper now is not your time
Go back
You've got somebody waitin'
Go back
That's where you need to be
Right now
There's nothing in this world more important than that
So go back

Go back

Go back

Go back <start> He climbs up on his John Deere
Shoves a plug of redman in his jaw
His eyes stretch cross the valley
Way down to where they're puttin' up a mall
His baseball cap says Kansas
The Washington says how much he can grow
There's a bank note in his pocket
That says in thirty days they'll have his home
It's hard living in a broken heartland
It's enough to break a man and his beliefs
Lord give him strength to mend this broken heartland
'Cause he's living proof of a dying breed
His sons gone off to college
Learning skills that'll get him off the farm
And his wife just keeps it all inside
Still he finds his only comfort in her arms
And this tractors been his treasure
Oh how could an auction measure its true worth
And every night he asks the father
That he may never lose this mother earth
It's hard living in a broken heartland
It's enough to break a man and his beliefs
Lord give him strength to mend this broken heartland
'Cause he's living proof of a dying breed
Lord give him strength to mend this broken heartland
'Cause he's living proof of a dying breed <start> When you cry all night
Till you're creating a streaming that falls forever
It's made of dreams
That didn't come true
And I'm sorry there's nothing more that I can do
When we get together
And take it from my fantasy and we'll react them
We'll work on you
Guess we lay motionless staring at the ceiling
With back turned up against the wall
But now I clearly see
Strained to the back of my skull and I'm shivering
All night long
And my skin is clear and you can see what I'm thinking
I'm thinking what I'm about
Oh the things I've been dreaming I've been dreaming about you
And only you
Turn the land into eight
And bury it in a parking lot and I'm constantly turned off
I look at the clock
And it's turning into hours and I got nothing to look forward to
'Cause I killed all the thoughts <start> My Uncle Pete was a trucker
Riding that Nullarbor Plain
Ten split gears and an overdrive
Chrome stacks shooting out flames
He'd throw me up into the cab
My little hands would grip the wheel
I would dream about the day
I could drive that rig for real
Rolling rolling rolling around the world
Ten years old and ten feet tall waving goodbye to
The girl next door
Rolling rolling today I'm the king of my street
I got my sleeves rolled up and my arm hanging out
As I drive off with Uncle Pete
As I drive off with Uncle Pete
Heading west on highway one
My eyes are glued to the road
The twoway always in my hand
Little Buddy that's my code
We pull into Micks for a pie and chips
Not a brussel sprout in sight
Some yarns to spin as we listen to
Slim Then we drive into the night
If I had one wish I'd want to be
If I had one wish I'd want to be
If I had one wish I'd want to be like my Uncle Pete <start> 
I'll love you as much as I can
That's about all I can do
I've always loved a little too much
There's not much of me for you

You want everything love can bring
If you'll leave me now I'll understand
I just want the best for you darlin'
I'll love you as much as I can

I know you believe you can change me
And make me much more than I am
But you never know the hurt I've been through
And what reason can do to a man

Maybe I'll show you some good times
But before you'll start making your plan
Remember the chance that you're taking
I'll love you as much as I can

If some day you will feel forsaken
Like you haven't been given enough
Remember the warning I gave you
And know it was given with love

I'll love you as much as I can
That's about all I can do
I've always loved a little too much
There's not much of me for you

You want everything love can bring
If you'll leave me now I'll understand
I just want the best for you darlin'
I'll love you as much as I can
I just want the best for you darlin'
I'll love you as much as I can <start> Hey hey good lookin' whatcha got cookin' how's about cookin' something up with me

You best remember me my B friend

I've done it enough and I oughta know
But then you came my way
And tore away the fear of pain
I won't loose again this time I know
I've got a winner in you
No way I can loose
A love I can hold on to
I've got a winner in you
I know how it feels when you try and try again
And then you never win I know how it feels
Oh but this time around
I've finally found what it's all about
They write songs about the way that I feel
I've got a winner in you
No way I can loose
A love I can hold on to
I've got a winner in you <start> Kiss away kiss away guess that's all that's left to say
Please come back and kiss these tears away
Smile again let me smile again make my life worthwhile again
Please come back and kiss these tears away
Only you can change these sad and blue days
Only you can make them Iloveyou days
So kiss away kiss away still there's nothing left to say
Please come back and kiss my tears away
Only you can change <start> There's some things that I regret
Some words I wish had gone unsaid
Some starts
That had some better endings
Been some bad times I've been through
Damage I cannot undo
Some things
I wish I could do all all over again
But it don't really matter
Life gets that much harder
It makes you that much stronger
Oh some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned
And every tear that had to fall from my eyes
Everyday I wonder how I get through the night
Every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every time
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned
There's mistakes that I have made
Some chances I just threw away
Some roads
I never should've taken
Been some signs I didn't see
Hearts that I hurt needlessly
Some wounds
That I wish I had one more chance to mend
But it don't make no difference
The past can't be rewritten
You get the life you're given
Oh some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned
And every tear that had to fall from my eyes
Everyday I wonder how I get through the night
Every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every time
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned
And all the things that break you
All the things that make you strong
You can't change the past
'Cause it's gone
And nothing's gotta go
Because they are gone
Lessons learned
And every tear that had to fall from my eyes
Everyday I wonder how I get through the night
Every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every time
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned
Oh some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned
Lessons learned <start> There's a blizzard comin' on how I'm wishin' I was home
For my pony's lame and he can't hardly stand
Listen to that Norther sigh if we don't get home we'll die
But it's only seven miles to Mary Ann
It's only seven miles to Mary Ann
You can bet we're on her mind 'cause it's nearly supper time
And I'll bet there's hot biscuits in the pan
Lord my hands feel like their froze there's a numbness in my toes
But there's only five more miles to Mary Ann
It's only five more miles to Mary Ann
That wind's howlin' and it seems mighty like a woman's screams
We best be movin' faster if we can
Dan just think about that barn with that hay so soft and warm
It's only three more miles to Mary Ann
It's only three more miles to Mary Ann
Well Dan get up you ornery cuss or you'll be the death of us
Well I'm so weary but I'll help ya if I can
Well all right Dan perhaps it's best that we stop a while and rest
For it's still a hundred yards from to Ann
It's still a hundred yards to Mary Ann <start> There's a comfort in the cross
On the hill above the town
Something steady for the meek
When it all comes crashing down
I've been known to talk to Jesus
But only when I needed to
I've got lots that needs forgiving
It all comes back to you
Out here searching for my shelter
I crossed the river  times
Wanna hear your sweet voice calling
Down the valley through the pines
I need something to believe in
Thirsty for a little truth
I've been running short on faith
My faith runs back to you
There's a quiet in the twilight
That's when I talk to you
Can you hear me
I pray you hear me
Yeah I hope I'm getting through
No one else could touch me
You had a way of cutting true
I've been bleeding for you darling
My blood runs back to you
My faith runs back to you
It all comes back to you <start> Well if you're wondering
It would seem if you
When the world came near or you
I would 
When it came crash into your roof
Who would be there for you
I would 
When nobody else would stay
I would 
When nobody else would pray
I would 
If you're wonderin who would be there
When nobody seemed to care
I would 
I would 
I would 
If the bullets were aflyin
And you didn't feel like dyin
I would 
If the ending was coming
And someone there running
I would 
If we ever go over the wall
I would 
If someone helps stay in front
I would 
If someone had to take it
And you couldn't make it
I would 
I would 
I would 
 
 
If you're sitting all alone
And you need someone to come over
I would 
If you're tired of talkin
You just feel like walkin
I would 
If you wanna sit on the steps
I would 
If you wanna see the solar eclipse
I would 
If you wanna fall in love
Give me the code
I would 
I would 
I would 
I would 
I would 
 
  <start> 
It would be a comfort just to know you never doubt me
Even though I give you cause most every day
Sometimes I think that you'd be better off without me
Although I love you in my own peculiar way
Don't doubt my love if sometimes my mind should wonder
To a suddenly remembered yesterday
'Cause my mind could never stay too long away from you
I'll always love you in my own peculiar way
And though I may not always be the way you'd have me be
And though my faults may grow in number day by day
Let no one ever say that I've ever been untrue
I'll always love you in my own peculiar way
I'll always love you in my own peculiar way <start> A little love that slowly grows and grows not one that comes and goes
That's all I want from you
A sunny day with hopes up to the sky a kiss and no goodbye
That's all I want from you
Don't let me down oh show me that you care
Remember when you give you also get your share
Don't let me down I have no time to wait
Tomorrow might not come when the dream is dreamed too late
A little love that slowly grows and grows not one that comes and goes
That's all I want from you

That's all I want from you

That's all I want from you
Don't let me down oh show me
That's all I want from you <start> By David Allan Coe
SHE'S EVERYTHING YOU LOOK FOR IN THAT KIND OF WOMAN
SHELL DRINK WHISKEY AND DANCE TILL THE CHAMPAGNES ALL GONE
SHELL BE RIGHT THERE WHEN THE AIR FROM THE OCEAN IS CALLING
TELLING YOU SAILOR BEWARE SOMETHING IS WRONG
BUT TOUCHING HER MIGHT MAKE YOU LOSE YOUR BLUES TONIGHT
HOLDING HER MIGHT STOP THE PAIN IN TIME
KISSING HER MIGHT TAKE AWAY THE LONELINESS YOU FELL
BUT LOVING HER WILL MAKE YOU LOSE YOUR MIND
JUST LIKE THE MOON AND THE STARS SHELL BE GONE IN THE MORNING
LEAVING YOU EMPTY AND DRAINED LIKE THE TIDE YOU'LL BE LOW
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO TAKE THAT WILL MAKE IT ALL BETTER
YOU'LL TRY TO BUY HER WITH PRESENTS  BUT SAILOR I KNOW. <start> Oh these many years I've loved you no one has ever known
No one has ever known but you alone
I've kept it locked inside my heart and smiled though all my tears
My darling I have loved you oh so many years
Each night within my lonely world I cried dear over you
And prayed to God the things will turn out right
But when the dawn of day appears I brush away my tears
My darling I have loved you oh so many years
I'll just go on pretending that my life is oh so gay
And happy dear without you by my side
When all the time my heart keeps longing just to have you near
My darling I have loved you oh so many years
Maybe fate will lead us down a path where we will meet again
And then we'll both be free to love anew
Then one sweet kiss from your dear lips will vanish all my fear
My darling I have loved you oh so many years <start> You treat love like a game
But you don't play by any rules
You keep an ace held up your sleeve
For any unsuspectin' fool
I thought I would be different
So I did not expect
That to you I'd be another
Heart in the deck
Just another heart
For you to shuffle around
Just a little part
Of a bigger game that's going down
I don't like this deal
So I'll get out while I still can
I don't want to be
Just another heart in your hand
Like a riverboat gambler
Someday you'll lose your touch
To a smooth operator
Who cheats you out of love
When your diamonds turn to teardrops
When your gold begins to rust
It's then you will know this feeling
Of running out of trust I'm
Just another heart
For you to shuffle around
Just a little part
Of a bigger game that's going down
I don't like this deal
So I'll get out while I still can
I don't want to be
Just another heart in your hand
I can't take anymore
Of what you're not giving me
I can live with a lot
But I don't want to be
Just another heart
For you to shuffle around
Just a little part
Of a bigger game that's going down
I don't like this deal
So I'll get out while I still can
I don't want to be
Just another heart in your hand
I don't like this deal
So I'll get out while I still can
'Cause I don't want to be
Just another heart in your hand
You treat love like a game
But your don't play by any rules <start> Don't expect too much from my poor old heart
You can blame the unforgiven for my scars
You might just be the best that I can find
But I can't seem.....
To forget the tears I've cried
Chorus I don't know that I will ever love again
It's the price that I must pay for all my sins
Time has changed me and left me full of doubt
and my heart may be lost never to be found
Once upon a time I did believe
In my true love that swept me off my feet
Then the winds of change swept him away
And left me drowning.....
In my pain

That's the end of my romance Mhm Mhm. <start> Come home come home it's suppertime the shadows lengthen fast
Come home come home it's suppertime we're going home at last
Many years ago in days of childhood I used to play when evening shadows come
Then winding down that old familiar pathway I heard my mother call at set of sun
Some of the fondest mem'ries of my childhood are woven around suppertime
When mother used to call from the backsteps of the old homeplace
Come on home Ferlin it's suppertime what I would give to hear that once more
But for me time has woven a realization of the truth that's even more thrilling
And that's when the call comes up from the portal of glory to come home
For it's suppertime when all of God's children shall gather around the table
With the Lord at the greatest suppertime of them all
Come home come home... <start> I made a promise to myself
Never again
To get burned by someone else
Until you walked in
I felt the old magic begin
I felt the room startin' to spin
As my will came tumbling down
I can't help it if I'm blindhearted
Fallin' again
I can't help it if my has started
Slowly cavin' in
And I keep on holdin' out for you
Oh I guess I'm just a blindhearted fool
I've got to find a way to live
On my own
I need to find someone who'll give
Me love that's strong
It's like a race against time
Until your face enters my mind
And you still
Burn me to the ground
I can't help it if I'm blindhearted
Fallin' again
I can't help it if my has started
Slowly cavin' in
And I keep on holdin' out for you
Oh I guess I'm just a blindhearted fool
Tell everyone to gather 'round
They won't believe the view
They're looking at a blindhearted fool
Over you <start> I've thought I needed things that I could by with gold
I scorn the treasure of her love my arms could hold
A love that made me richer than a king yes I'm the man who had everything
I had a dream that I could live for a heart that I could claim
Yes I'm the man who had everything
I had a love worth more than diamonds the best that life could bring
Yes I'm the man who had everything
Now I drive a fancy car that's all my own each night I dine on wine and caviar alone
But since I lost her love through tears I see yes I'm the man who had everything
I had a dream that I could live for...
Yes I'm the man who had everything yes I'm the man who had everything <start> Well this town has closed down way too early
And there's nothin' to do
So I'm drivin' around in circles and I'm thinkin' about you
Today I heard you got a new last name
Sure didn't know it was gonna hit me this way
And the radio just keeps playin' all this songs about rain

Now there's all kinda songs about babies and love that goes right
But for some unknown reason nobody wants to play them tonight
Hey I hope it's sunny wherever you are
But that's sure not the picture tonight in my car
And it sure ain't easin' my pain all these songs like
Rainy night in Georgia Kentucky rain
Here comes that rainy day feelin' again
Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain
They go on and on and there's no two the same
Oh it would be easy to blame all these songs about rain
Well I thought I was over you
But I guess maybe I'm not
'Cause when I let you go looks like lonely is all that I got
Guess I'll never know what could have been
Sure ain't helpin' this mood that I'm in
If they're gonna keep on playin' these songs like
Rainy night in Georgia Kentucky rain
Here comes that rainy day feelin' again
Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain
They go on and on
There's no two the same
Oh how I wish I could blame all these songs about rain
Rainy night in Georgia Kentucky rain
Here comes that rainy day feelin' again
Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain
They go on and on
There's no two the same
Rainy night in Georgia Kentucky rain
Here comes that rainy day feelin' again
Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain
They go on and on
There's no two the same <start> You ain't dancing to this song
Aw but I can tell you're dying to
Your lips are singing right along
But you won't let yourself let loose
'Cause you ain't fooling me
Come on girl I gotta see
Whoa baby what you got hiding under that halo
That little bit of rebel nobody knows
That turn it up burn it up all night
Wanna do a little something wrong kind of right
Bet you got a little sway hiding in those hips
A little bit of salt in your sweet kiss
Why you holding back girl let it go
Baby what you hiding under that halo
You keep sipping nice and slow
Like you're scared it's gonna go to your head
Baby I bet you'd love catching a groove and a real good buzz
Having a night you'll never forget
So girl just take my hand
You know you wanna take a chance
Whoa baby what you got hiding under that halo
That little bit of rebel nobody knows
That turn it up burn it up all night
Wanna do a little something wrong kind of right
Bet you got a little sway hiding in those hips
A little bit of salt in your sweet kiss
Why you holding back girl let it go
Baby what you hiding under that halo
I wanna get you alone halo
See what's under that halo
Don't you wanna move baby
Don't you wanna dance maybe
Don't you wanna get a little crazy
A little crazy tonight
Baby what you got hiding under that halo
That little bit of rebel nobody knows
That turn it up burn it up all night
Wanna do a little something wrong kind of right
Bet you got a little sway hiding in those hips
A little bit of salt in your sweet kiss
Why you holding back girl let it go
Baby what you hiding under that halo
Baby what you hiding under that halo
I wanna get you alone halo
See what's under that halo <start> Now I can buy the proverbial gun
And shoot the proverbial child
When my uncle looks me in the eye
And speaks of freedom
My conscience goes up on trial
In the courtrooms of the mind
Where the judges all have sons
And all the lawyers all were dead
And the backs are all broke
And the bailiff is my brother
And the witness is my sister
And I'm guilty as hell
And by the afternoon I'm out
On the pavement walking
Reeking of salt and blood
No hair upon my head
No shoes upon my feet
Picking your body from my teeth
No stars above me
No stripes upon me
Free  <start> Empty parking lot half a cigarette
I got it off the ground so it's a little wet
I'm on the south side walking sideways
I got too drunk again
It's a cold night kinda late this year
Plans made the cops are gone and we're outta here
But I need to catch my breath 'cause its  a.m.
And I still miss someone
This is the last last time I beg the sun to shine
Addicted to a memory and it's killing me
This is the last last time
I should hide at home but I can't drive
Everybody's calling me to see if I'm alive
They say they've got a friend that I need to meet
And she's never heard of you
This is the last last time I beg the sun to shine
Addicted to a memory and it's killing me
This is the last last time I beg the sun to shine
Addicted to a memory and it's killing me
This is the last last time I try to change your mind
I'm addicted to the misery and it's killing me
Yeah it's killing me
You all start killing me <start> If I give my heart to you tonight
Will you still be by my side
Or will you be gone with the morning sun
Like a restless bird in flight
Take me in your arms
Let the love you seek
Wash away your sorrow
Let the morning be ours to keep
And if I should tell you of the love that I feel
Will you still be there for me
Or will I awake to a faded love
Searching for freedoms gain
Take me in your arms
Let the love you seek
Wash away your sorrow
Let the morning be ours to keep
Take me in your arms
Let the love you seek
Wash away your sorrow
Let the morning be ours to keep
If I give my heart to you tonight
Will you still be by my side
Or will you be gone with the morning sun
Like a bird who yearns to fly <start> We sure can love each other when we try
Just like in all those love songs when we try
And some nights I love you so much contend to be beside you
And when I finally close my eyes the sun is high
But we sure can hurt each other when we try
We know all the ways to make each other cry
But when we forget compassion and to forgive is too old fashioned
We've let everything worth having pass us by
But we sure can love each other when we try
And I know we'll need each other till we die
And we'll grow old together you and I
Cause we sure can love each other when we try
Yes we sure can love each other when we try <start> I've tried so hard to keep our home alive
But you don't even care that I'm around
You tell me that somehow our love has died
And you'd rather be set free than be tied down
All right I'll sign the papers even though you know I love you so
All right I'll sign the papers but oh how it hurts to see you go
I've laid awake at nights when you were gone
And thought of all the things that I could do
To try and make you happy when you come home
But the more I try the more you make me blue
All right I'll sign the papers
But oh how it hurts to see you go <start> Ever ever after
Storybook endings fairy tales coming true
Deep down inside we want to believe they still do
And a secret is taught it's our favorite part of the story
Let's just admit we all want to make it too
Ever ever after
If we just don't get it our own way
Ever ever after
It may only be a wish away
Start a new fashion wear your heart on your sleeve
Sometimes you reach what's realest by making believe
Unafraid unashamed
There is joy to be claimed in this world
You even might wind up being glad to be you
Ever ever after
Though the world will tell you it's not smart
Ever ever after
The world can be yours if you let your heart
Believe in ever after
No wonder your heart feels it's flying
Your head feels it's spinning
Each happy ending's a brand new beginning
Let yourself be enchanted you just might break through
To ever ever after
Forever could even start today
Ever ever after
Maybe it's just one wish away
Your ever ever after
Ever ever ever after
I've been dreaming of a true love's kiss
Ooh
For ever ever after <start> Let's live for tonight dear it's better that way tomorrow we might be apart
Let's live for tonight dear let love let its way
For tomorrow we could have two broken hearts
Lets cast all our worries and heartaches inside forget what the future might hold
Let's live for tonight dear in a world all our own
For tomorrow we may have to be alone
Let's live for tonight dear and try to pretend that we will never be alone
No matter what happened this night will be ours
What tomorrow brings nobody ever knows
For tomorrow we may have to be alone <start> There is a sea and I am a captain
Of something unknown waves high as mountains
There is a key and there is a lie
Here's to times that I catch it
May it last through the night
I'm as low as they come
I'm what shouldn't be done
Filthy and lost
Still up for trying
You're the one reason why
I look up and smile
Wishing alone
And I'm ready to forge ahead
There is a sea and I am a captain
Of something unknown waves high as mountains
There is a key and there is a lie
Here's to times that I catch it
May it last through the night
Dark thoughts are hidden
Masked in the shadows
Times they estrange
Colors are full
We all will fit in
Climb in our armor
Traveling fast
The judgement is past
Now it's time to go on
There is a sea and I am a captain
Of something unknown waves high as mountains
There is a key and there is a lie
Here's to times that I catch it
May it last through the night
Limbs that won't turn
When the fire won't burn
Like it did when we felt it
Deep in our hearts
Untie the rudder
Guide them away
Take me off sir
Take me off sir
There is a sea and I am a captain
Of something unknown waves high as mountains
There is a key and there is a lie
Here's to times that I catch it
May it last through the night <start> I remember it now we were kids back then living down on the farm
We were told that the city could only bring us harm
Well how far away is the city you know that's a great big town
And Barbara said why it's a million miles and then the story got around
It's a million miles to the city from the hills and valleys we know
It's a million miles to the city and some day we all wanna go
There was a town nearby but a town is a town and a city that's somethin' else
Our daddy had been to a city but he never was much help
The buildings're taller than oak trees ah but we knew better than that
Cause ain't nobody could climb that high the city was wide and flat
It's a million miles
The years have passed and we have grown and traveled far and wide
The cities have changed the kids we were we see it in each other's eyes
Lord I'd love to go back to those hills again to the boy I used to be
Where the leaves in the wind and the whippoorwills
Were all just a part of the land like me
It's a million miles <start> Last night I dreamed I was kid again
All the things I used to do I went and did again
Spent the afternoon with my best and closest friend
Wanderin' through the days we thought would never end
It was back when I'd still get things from Santa Claus
Back when he believed in me and overlooked the flaws
That can grow inside until it hides the perfect little boy inside the man
I'm not a kid anymore but I still believe that those miracles occur
That's not something up his sleeve
And that the reindeer pull the sleigh and the elves still make the toys
Santa gives away to all the girls and boys
Tonight I'll climb back in that bed again
Try to live out all my dreams inside my head again
After Christmas Eve with my best and closest friend
Who still believes the world's greatest dad just tucked him in
And I know that he'll be looking out for Santa Claus
And I'm sure beyond a doubt he'll overlook the flaws
That will grow inside until it hides this perfect little boy inside a man
I'm not a kid anymore and I still believe that miracles occur
That's not something up his sleeve
And that the reindeer pull the sleigh and the elves do make the toys
Santa gives away to all the girls and boys <start> 
Today I passed you on the street and my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you and hold you just the way I used to do
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you <start> Red hung out at the point of tears
He was a honky tonkin' fool
Ever since they brought that jukebox here
Back in 
He was the first to drop a nickel in
When he danced with his first wife
By ' his wife was gone
But that jukebox had survived
It was three plays for a quarter
I turned on enough to go
Red showed me that ol' Wurlitzer
And said Son I want you to know
If you ever come up to be short
Just kick it on the side
Would you do this honky tonkin' fool
One favor when I die
Roll away my tombstone
Put this jukebox in its place
Make damned sure 'Your Cheatin' Heart'
Is the only song it plays
I don't need no stone with fancy words
This jukebox unverified cool
As a perfect final tribute to a honky tonkin' fool
When we heard the news me and Mr. Hughes
Put that jukebox in my truck
And hauled it on down to the place
That ol' Red had hung it up
And I ran a short extension cord
From the old caretaker's shed
I kicked the side played 'Your Cheatin' Heart'
Looked down at Red and said
Red I rolled away your tombstone
Put this jukebox in its place
And I made damned sure 'Your Cheatin' Heart'
Is the only song it plays
You were right about that tombstone Red
This jukebox unverified cool
As a perfect final tribute to a honky tonkin' fool
It's the perfect final tribute to a honky tonkin' fool <start> If you ever gonna kiss me then do it now
If you ever gonna want me then want me now
Let's do a little spoonin' wind upon a honeymoonin'
And if you ever gonna love me then do it now
Don' wait until my hair turns grey show me that you care
I might be too old to appreciate the love we now could share
If you ever gonna hold me then do it now
If you ever gonna squeeze me then squeeze me now
Let's find a preacher man let's live in a lover's land
If you ever gonna love me then do it now
 guitar 
Don' wait until my hair turns grey show me that you care
I might be too old to appreciate the love we now could share
If you ever gonna hug me then do it now
If you ever gonna need me then need me now
Let's walk in the moonlight let's live in a paradise
If you ever gonna love me then do it now <start> There's a distance in your eyes
You don't wanna get too close
And I don't know why we're good together
We've come so far
So I can't understand
Why I can't ever get to your heart tell me
What have you got against love
What have you got against us
Won't you tell me what's the hold up
What have you got against love
A tragic romance a bad goodbye
Did somebody make you think
Love was made to die
If that's the reason you're holding out
Don't put the blame on the one who wants you
And needs you now tell me
What have you got against love
What have you got against us
Won't you tell me what's the hold up
What have you got against falling
Why do you keep it all in
Won't you tell me what's the hold up
What have you got against love
What have you got against love
What have you got against us
Won't you tell me what's the hold up
What have you got against love <start> She says she hates to sleep alone
but she'll do it to night
She wants to grab her telephone
but she knows it ain't right
So if he won't call she'll survive
and if he don't care she'll get by
Climb into bed bury her head and cry
From the beginning he was all anyone could have been
They were delirious with love
they were certain to win
Now he's breaking plans more and more
and he's leaving notes on her door
Took a trip out of town couldn't turn this one down
He said I guess I should have told you before.
She says she feels like she's addicted to a real bad thing
Always sitting waiting wondering if the phone will ring
She knows she bounces like a yoyo when he pulls her string
It hurts to feel like such a fool.
She wants to tell him not to call or come a round again
He doesn't need her now at all the way that she needs him.
She's on the edge about to fall from leaning out and in
And she don't know which way to move.
She wants to be fair she couldn't say he was ever unkind
But if she could bear to walk away
she thinks he wouldn't mind
'Cause he just keeps himself
so apart and there's no one else in her heart
So she's taking a dive from an emotional high and coming down hard.
She's determined to try
but she'll still give in when he gives her a call.
She'll ask herself why but in the end it won't matter at all.
Sure she could sit at home stay inside
and sleep alone with her pride
And as she walks out that door she feels
as weak as before with nothing to hide.
She says she feels like she's addicted to a real bad thing
Always sitting waiting wondering if the phone will ring
She knows she bounces like a yoyo when he pulls her string
It hurts to feel like such a fool.
She wants to tell him not to call or come a round again

It hurts to feel like such a fool. <start> Can't you see that it's just raining
Ain't no need to go outside
But baby you hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song is meant to keep you
From doing what you're supposed to.
Waking up too early
Maybe we can sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now
And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining
There ain't no need to go outside
But just maybe like a ukulele
Momma made a baby
Really don't mind the practice
'Cause you're my little lady
Lady lady love me
'Cause I love to lay here lazy
We could close the curtains
Pretend like there's no world outside
And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining
There ain't no need to go outside
Ain't no need ain't no need mmm mmm
Can't you see can't you see
Rain all day and I don't mind
But the telephone is singing
Ringing
It's too early
Don't pick it up
We don't need to
We got everything
We need right here
And everything we need is enough
Just so easy
When the whole world fits inside of your arms
Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm
Wake up slow mmm mm wake up slow
But baby you hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song is meant to keep ya
From doing what you're supposed to
Waking up too early
Maybe we can sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now
And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining
There ain't no need to go outside
Ain't no need ain't no need
Rain all day and I really really really don't mind
Can't you see can't you see
You gotta wake up slow <start> I never had a pair of shoes that weren't all handmedowns
And daddy's morning coffee came from ol' left over ground
My mama wore no jewelry or any store bought stuff
And home was on a hillside forty miles from Poplar Bluff
Chorus
Forty miles back in Missouri there's a different way of life
Where a man thinks of his neighbor and not his neighbor's wife
Life is far from fancy sometimes mighty rough
But contentment makes it worth it forty miles from Poplar Bluff
Our only family treasure was a beat up radio
But it took us to the places where we knew we'd never go
We never had much money but we always had enough
'Cause money never mattered much forty miles from Poplar Bluff
Chorus
Well nearly every winter when the snow is on the ground
And the roads would all be closed and we couldn't get to town
But if daddy had his tobacco grandma had her snuff
Then the winters didn't seem so long forty miles from Poplar Bluff <start> I'd walk across Kansas in a New York minute
Climb the Colorado mountains in the fall
Crawl through Arizona like a flatland lizard
If I thought it'd do me any good at all
I could swim Lake Erie with my hands tied behind me
Eat a West Virginia coal miner's shoes
Drink the Mississippi River if it took a month of Sundays
Just to prove my love for you
I remember well the first time that I kissed you
Cause the things ain't been the same ever since
You got me thinkin' I could eat a ten penny nail And spit out a barbed wire fence
Now there ain't a livin' creature gonna ever come between us
I'd fight lions snakes and gorillas too
And if that ain't enough
We'll start all over just to prove my love for you
I could ride my pony through the eye of a hurricane
Climb Mount Everest on a string
Jump Niagara Falls in a burnin' barrel
And bring you back a hoop smoke ring
Wrestle alligators in the Okefenokee
There's nothin' I wouldn't do
If you just say the word I'll catch
That Great Speckled Bird and bring it back to you
I remember well the first time
I'd walk across Kansas in a New York minute <start> They say don't go on Wolverton Mountain
If you're looking for a wife.
'Cause Clifton Clowers has a pretty
Young daughter
He's mighty handy with a gun and a knife.
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey
And Wolverton Mountain protects her there.
The bears and birds tell Clifton Clowers
If a stranger should wander there.
All of my dreams are on Wolverton Mountain.
I want his daughter for my wife.
I'll take my chances and climb that mountain
Though Clilfton Clowers he may take my life
Her tender lips
I'm going up on Wolverton Mountain
It's too lonely down here below.
It's just not right to hide his daughter
From the one who loves her so.
Her tender lips
But I don't care about Clifton Clowers
I'm gonna climb up on his mountain
I'm gonna take the girl I love.
I don't care about Clifton Clowers
I'm gonna climb up on his mountain
I'm gonna take the girl I love. <start> I left home with a suitcase my songs and my guitar
Headed down to Nashville gonna try to be a star
The Nashville folks they made me feel like I was right at home
But they couldn't understand my cowboy songs
They said son you've got potential
And we'd like to see you stay
But you've gotta change your style
'Cause cowboy songs don't sell these days
I tried my hand at cheatin' heart and cryin' in my beer
And I think about home and wonder what am I doin' here
But I'd really like to thank y'all for your hospitality
You know I really mean it you've been mighty good to me
But this ol' country boy
Ain't where he's suppose to be
And this Wyoming cowboy
Don't belong in Nashville Tennessee
Well there's just too many miles and styles between us I suppose
The kind of songs I'm singin' won't fit in down here I know
I kind of got the feeling it was time to move along
When Ed Bruce sang 'The last cowboy song'
So I'm going back to the country where the west is still alive
Where cowboy's ride the prairie and the mountains touch the sky
I pack up my old guitar and I'll be on my way
But before I go I'd just like to say
Well I'd really like to thank
Well this Wyoming cowboy
Don't belong in Nashville Tennessee <start> Place my body on the funeral pyre
Cut it loose to float downstream
Leave it frozen on a mountain top
Suspend it high to be picked clean
You said never to grow old
But you forgot to tell me how
You said never to grow old
And then you sank your teeth into those final feet
Last night I dreamt of owls at my window
I knew that time was winding down
Turned to tell you of my premonition
Changed my mind and lay back down
You said never to grow old
But you forgot to tell me how
You said never to grow old
And then you sank your teeth into those final feet
No sense wasting the time you got
You got to walk down every road
No sense pretending that you're what you're not
When you got to shoulder every load
You said never to grow old
But you forgot to tell me how
You said never to grow old
And then you sank your teeth into those final feet
Cut it loose cut it loose cut it loose
You said never to grow old
But you forgot to tell me how
You said never to grow old
And then you sank your teeth into those final feet <start> Weather man said it's gonna snow
By now I should be used to the cold
MidFebruary shouldn't be so scary
It was only December I still remember
The presents the tree you and me
But you went away
How dare you
I miss you
They say I'll be OK
But I'm not going to ever get over you
Living alone here in this place
I think of you and I'm not afraid
Your favorite records make me feel better
Cause you sing along with every song
I know you didn't mean to give them to me
But you went away
How dare you
I miss you
They say I'll be OK
But I'm not going to ever get over you
It really sinks in you know
When I see it in stone
Cause you went away
How dare you
I miss you
They say I'll be OK
But I'm not going to ever get over you
Ever get over you <start> By J. Bolotin
HE CARRIES HIS IDEAS
AND HIS BOOKS BOUND IN LEATHER
AND A CHANGE OF CLOTHING
AND A PICTURE OF ANNA WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER
LEST HE FORGET HER.
AND IN AMONG HIS PAPERS
IS A LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE HE KNEW
AND MANY UNSENT LETTERS
TELLING SOMEONE THAT HE'D BE THERE
SOMETIME SOON.
HEY STRANGER AREN'T YOU THE TIREDNESS THAT REMAINS
WHEN YOU THINK FREEDOM CANT BE MEASURED
BY THE SCUFFLES ON YOUR BOOTS
HEY HEY HEY
NOW HE DREAMS OF ANNA A LIFE IN THE TIME THEY WERE TOGETHER
HE WAS HARD AND SHE WAS SUPPLE
WHERE THEY LIVED OUT IN THE COUNTRY
SHE THOUGHT GENTLE
LIKE HIS HANDS UPON HER BODY
AND WHEN ANNA FELT THE COOLING WIND
DAVID FELT THE NEED TO BE BLOWN DOWN
AND WHEN ANNA FELT THE CLEANSING RAIN
DAVID FOUGHT THE FEAR THAT HE MIGHT DROWN
HEY STRANGER AND NOW YOU WONDER THROUGH THE COUNTRY
THAT YOU HOPE IS MUCH LESS FRIGHTENING
WHEN ITS QUICKER PASSING BY
HEY HEY HEY
NOW IN SOUTHERN ARIZONA
AT THE LAST CHANCE DINER COUNTER
BEING QUESTIONED BY THE WAITRESS
HE PREPARES FOR THE DESERT
WITH HIS FREEDOM
AND A CANTEEN OF WATER <start> Three thirty in the morning
Not a soul in sight
The city's lookin' like a ghost town
On a moonless summer night
Raindrops on the windshield
There's a storm movin' in
He's headin' back from somewhere
That he never should have been
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls
Every light is burnin'
In a house across town
She's pacin' by the telephone
In her faded flannel gown
Askin' for miracle
Hopin' she's not right
Prayin' it's the weather
That's kept him out all night
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls
The thunder rolls
And the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold
On a sleepless night
As the storm blows on
Out of control
Deep in her heart
The thunder rolls
She's waitin' by the window
When he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him
Thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain
A strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes
And he knows that she knows
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls <start> Is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine
Do you miss me like I miss you is it cloudy all the time
Do you tremble when the phone rings and you think I'm on the line
Is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine
Chorus
Does it thunder and lightning even when the sun shines
Is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine
Is it raining at your place just like it is over here
If it is then sweetheart like me I know you're scared
I just called you to console you like any old friend would do
Is it raining at your house and by the way I still love you
Chorus <start> You ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter
She's a little bit fuller and you're a whole lot shorter
Let's dance all night and fill the jukebox full of quarters
'Cause you ain't Dolly no and you ain't Porter
Well I noticed you right off the bat in those cowboy boots
Who couldn't help but see you in that rhinestone suit
That's cause I'm the reigning queen of karaoke night
Well if I get drunk enough to sing hell I just might
Hey now don't you worry cowboy cause I'll get you through
We'll sing a cheating song just like they used to do
Cause you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter
She's a little bit fuller
Yeah but you're a whole lot shorter
Let's drink all night and fill the jukebox full of quarters
Cause you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter
You'll probably see me country singing on The Voice someday
Yeah and I'm the guy they wrote about in  Shades of Grey
Why don't you come on back to my place and you can have your way
Well baby that sounds tempting but I just can't stay
Oh we won first prize cowboy let's just split the dough
Honey I will always love you but we'll never know
Cause you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter
She's a little bit fuller
Yeah and you're a whole lot shorter
We danced all night and filled the jukebox full of quarters
Cause you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter no
No you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter <start> Oh Lord please forgive me for what I'm about to do
I'm running on empty and my options are few
You know that I did the best that I can
But i've done hit rock bottom my time is at hand
Because I lost my job
My bills are getting bigger
Cryin' baby bout to lose my mind
Hundred dollar habit I ain't got a penny
My woman ran off with a friend of mine
I can't keep a job cause I'm too fucked up
DHS bout to take my kids
Tryin' to get well keep getting sicker
Sittin' in the parking lot my finger on the trigger
You know I never meant to hurt anyone
And I'll face the consequences for everything I've done
And Lord sometimes I wonder if your even there
'Cause my burden is backbreaking and it's all that I can bear
Because I lost my job
My bills are getting bigger
Cryin' baby bout to lose my mind
Hundred dollar habit I ain't got a penny
My woman ran off with a friend of mine
I can't keep a job cause I'm too fucked up
DHS bout to take my kids
Tryin' to get well keep getting sicker
Sittin' in the parking lot my finger on the trigger <start> You haven't said it
But I've seen the words in your eyes
Coming like heavy black clouds
To clear summer skies
You go thru the motions
Of given your heart
I don't feel a thing
Cause were so Far apart
And its all over
It's all over but the crying
I believe there's nothing I can do
The Heart to changes sweetness over you
Your warmth has gone and your smile is alive
You found so many ways of saying GOOD BYE
You haven't said it
But I've read the signs in your face
No mention of leaving
But everything carry's its trace
I spend each moment
Preparing myself for the pain
And the loneliness back on my shelf
Cause Its all over its all but the crying
Its all over but I've seen it coming on
Its all over the love we had is gone
It's all over but the final farewell
Will be your way of turning my heaven to hell <start> Shortcut to part of Bill Monroe Lyrics

Full Bill Monroe Lyrics... <start> Easy come easy go I found out a long time ago
Ain't no future in the past broken hearts and all that jazz
No tears of mine're gonna flow I'll have another love tomorrow easy come easy go
If it's true what you say in your letters if your sweet love for me is really gone
If there's somebody else that you love better
Pack your bag shake my hand and move along
Easy come easy go...
So you took my photograph from your pocket
And replaced it with the one you love the best
Well I'll give back your ring and I can hock it what's one little diamond more or less
Easy come easy go... <start> Some glad morning when this life is o'er I'll fly away
To a home on God's celestial shore I'll fly away
Oh I'll fly away oh Glory I'll fly away when I'll die hallelujah by and by I'll fly away
When the shadows of this life have gone I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison bars have flown I'll fly away
Oh I'll fly away oh Glory I'll fly away when I'll die hallelujah by and by I'll fly away
 ac.guitar 
Just a few more weary days and then I'll fly away
To a land where joy shall never end I'll fly away
Oh I'll fly away oh Glory I'll fly away when I'll die hallelujah by and by I'll fly away
Oh I'll fly away oh Glory I'll fly away when I'll die hallelujah by and by I'll fly away <start> It only took a minute for us to finally end it
I guess we'd seen it comin' for some time
And it only took one hour to sit and talk it over
But it took us all night long to say goodbye
Now the flame is gone I know
And the ashes have grown cold
And the love we had we'll never have again
But there's one ember left that must have never died
'Cause it took us all night long to say goodbye
Too many tears have fallen too many dreams were broken
And holdin' on would be a waste of time
But sometimes I know I'll wonder if it was really over
'Cause it took us all night to say goodbye
Now the flame is gone I know
And the ashes have grown cold
And the love we had we'll never have again
But there's one ember left that must have never died
'Cause it took us all night long to say goodbye <start> Smiles in the morning as warm as sunshine
Kisses when I lay down at night
And two loving arms to console me
I should be scared it's so right
But too much of a good thing is a good thing
Feelings like this can't be wrong
And too much of a good thing is a good thing
And we've got a good thing going on
You look in my eyes and see my thinking
I know when you're happy and when you're sad
Some would say it's too perfect
But I don't think what we have is so bad
Cause too much of a good thing is a good thing
Feelings like this can't be wrong
And too much of a good thing is a good thing
And we've got a good thing going on <start> Strap yourself in
Hang on for the ride
Dirts gonna fly
Grounds gonna shake tonight
You don't have to look far
Cause it's right here in your back yard
There's a hundred tracks across our land
They call home this fearless band of dirt track
Dirt Track cowboys
Dirt tracking Cowboys
Mudslinging Outlaws
This ain't no Hollywood star wars
It's the real deal open wheel
Dirt Track cowboys
There ain't nothing like
A big angry field
Tearing down the back straight
Wheel to wheel
He's got a big V underneath that hood
When the lights go green
Rushy's gonna scream
The wildest boys you ever have seen
They're dirt track dirt track cowboys
Dirt tracking Cowboys
Mudslinging Outlaws
This ain't no Hollywood star wars
It's the real deal open wheel
Dirt Track cowboys
Dirt tracking Cowboys
Mudslinging Outlaws
This ain't no Hollywood star wars
It's the real deal open wheel
Dirt Track cowboys
Dirt tracking Cowboys
Mudslinging Outlaws
This ain't no Hollywood star wars
It's the real deal open wheel
Dirt Track cowboys
Dirt track Cowboys
Dirt track Cowboys <start> All I have to offer you is me
Before you take another step there's something you should know
About the years ahead and how they'll be
You'll be living in a world where roses hardly ever grow
Cause all I have to offer you is me
There'll be no mansions waiting on the hill with crystal chandeliers
And there'll be no fancy clothes for you to wear
Everything I have is standing here in front for you to see
Yes all I have to offer you is me
Sweetheart I'll give you all my love in every way I can
But be sure of what you want while you're still free
The only gold I have to give is in this wedding band
Yes all I have to offer you is me
There'll be no mansions
Yes all I have to offer you is me <start> We are not in a position to display these lyrics due to licensing restrictions. Sorry for the inconvinience. <start> Nobody loves me nobody cares
If life is empty and full of tears
I long for true love searched everywhere
Nobody loves me nobody cares
Searchin' for true love has been in vain
Through years my heart has suffered with pain
Life's lonesome burden now I must bear
Nobody loves me nobody cares
Nights on my pillow I dream of love
Through space I gaze at the stars above
They seem to whisper from way up there
Nobody loves you nobody cares
A lonesome heart and a troubled mind
In this old world now is all I find
I look to heaven for I know there
Someone will love me someone will care <start> Speed River at my feet running low and flat
I'm sitting here burning daylight
Thinking about the past
And that distance out there
Where the earth meets the sky
The slightest move and this river mud
Pulls me further down
John's at my side but he's sitting on firmer ground
John says I look at the moon and the stars
These days more often than I look into his eyes
And I can't disagree so I don't say nothing
I just stare on past his face at Venus rising
Like a shining speck of hope hanging over the horizon
With each passing year that I sit here
That horizon seems to inch just that much nearer
And all that appears on it seems as clear as spit
But if there's on thing in my life
That these years have taught
It's that you can always see it coming
But you can never stop it
Speed River at my feet running low and flat
I'm sitting here burning daylight
Thinking about the past
And that distance out there
Where the earth meets the sky
The slightest move and this river mud
Pulls me further down
John's at my side
But he's not noticing that I'm drowning
The slightest move and this river mud
Pulls me further down
John's at my side
But he's not noticing that I'm drowning <start> Sweet babe a golden cradle holds thee
Soft thy mother's arms enfold thee
Fairest flowers are strew before thee
Sweet birds warble o'er thee
So sleep my babe and dream away sorrow
Peace until you wake tomorrow
I will guard thine infant slumber
Angels watch thy number <start> I hope that I won't be that wrong anymore
Maybe I've learned this time
I hope that I find what I'm reaching for
The way that it is in my mind
Chorus
Someday I'll get over you
And I'll live to see it all through
But I'll always miss
Dreaming my dreams with you
I won't let it change me not if I can
I'd rather believe in love
And give it away as much as I can
To those that I'm fond this time
Chorus <start> All that keeps me goin' is knowin' that you love me and you're mine
All that keeps me goin' is knowin' you're gonna see me through troubled times
This morning when I woke up that ole sun didn't wanna shine
So I just laid back and let your mem'ry fell down across my mind
And suddenly it was yesterday and I was lying in your arms
And somehow just the thought of you turned my world on and made me warm
All that keeps me goin'...
All that keeps me goin'... <start> You fuckin' douchebag
I don't have to be a hero
I can just walk these streets
Wait around for a driveby wakeup call
I don't have to go work just to get the job complete
That kind of work always makes me feel so small
It's your concern it's my concern
You tell me that you love me but love is such a funny word
I could hitch a ride to Phoenix or up to Ontario
There'll always be a stranger with a light for my smoke
I could dream about the big time
I could play the lottery
Make my first million from a gas station scratchoff machine
It's your concern it's my concern
You ask me if I love you
Don't ask a question with such a funny word
It's really funny funny
You let me sleep all morning
You let me share your bed
And you say that I need to make a few new friends
Love works both ways you tell me every day
But love is such a funny word
Oh baby love is such a funny word
I tell you that love is such a funny word
I tell you that love is such a funny word
I tell you that love is such a funny word
I tell you that love is such a funny word
Funny funny <start> Written by Billy Burnette and Mentor Williams.
Whatcha gonna do when the sun
goes down
Hop in my back seat way out of town
I know a place we can't be found
Whatcha gonna do when the sun
goes down
I've been savin' my favorite shirt
Savin' it up for a Friday night
This time I'm gonna make it work
Gonna make it work with all my might
So whatcha gonna do when the sun
goes down
Hop in my back seat way out of town
I know a place we can't be found
Whatcha gonna do when the sun
goes down
Waxin' up my shiny car
Getting' ready for the weekend
Top down we can see the stars
Blowin' that summer wind
Whatcha gonna do when the sun
goes down
Hop in my back seat way out of town
I know a place we can't be found
Whatcha gonna do when the sun
goes down
Let's hide away and let the feelin' in
I wanna hear you say you love me
once again
Let's hide away and let the night begin
Ohwatcha gonna do when the sun
goes down
Hop in my back seat way out of town
I know a place we can't be found
Whatcha gonna do when the sun
goes down <start> I Will With You
give me another
piece of your heart
splinter it slowly
things fall apart
dig in the garden
dirty your knees
with flowers forgotten
and old linden trees
remember for me
remember for me
remember for me
remember for me
corner the quiet
that covers the sound
whispers you ran from
and time ran around
tears on the floorboards
remember it now
remember it now
remember it now
remember it now
and i will
with you
remember it now
remember it now
remember it now <start> Bonnie look at the girdly I'll take a picture of you
Bonnie hold up the gun in your hand so deadly shiny and blue
Mhm mhm mhm mhm a picture of Bonnie
Bonnie smile at the camera for hist'ry we are a part of
Bonnie smile so the whole world will know a pretty the one that I love
Mhm mhm mhm mhm a picture of Bonnie mhm mhm mhm mhm
Bonnie stand in the sunlight you been in those shadows too long
I'll take a picture of you in the sun Bonnie that's where you belong
Mhm mhm mhm mhm a picture of Bonnie
Somewhere in pages of hist'ry there's a picture of lovin' affair
A picture of Miss Bonnie Parker lovingly taken by far
Mhm mhm mhm mhm a picture of Bonnie <start> I hear footsteps slowly walkin'
As they gently walk across a lonely floor
And a voice is softly sayin'
Darling this will be goodbye forever more
There goes my reason for livin'
There goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession
There goes my everything
As my mem'ry turns back the pages
I can see the happy years we had before
Now the love that kept this old heart beatin'
Has been shattered by the closin' of the door
There goes my reason for livin'
There goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession
There goes my everything <start> Duet by Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner

I wasn't looking for you when I found you I just turned and I saw you there
And I was so lonely and lost when I found you and I needed somebody to care
And it had been so long since I'd been happy or needed or wanted or loved
And now that I've found you let my arms around you oh love have mercy on us
Have mercy on us don't let it be wrong for there is nothing to live all alone
And now that you're mine may love treat us kind oh love have mercy on us
Oh what must we do with this love for each other is it wrong to love one so much
I want to be with you and oh how I miss you oh love have mercy on us
Have mercy on us... <start> I've heard all the songs you're singing today there's one thing I don't understand
That's why you don't sing more songs about Jesus my hero
Yes Jesus Christ now there was a man
So sing me some songs about Jesus cause I am a big Jesus fan
Sing me more songs about Jesus my Saviour Jesus Christ oh what a man
I've heard all your songs about living and dying I admire you deep in every word
Oh but you haven't lived till you've heard Roy Acuff
Sing about Jesus and the Great Speckled Bird
So sing me some songs about Jesus cause I am a big Jesus fan
Sing me more songs about Jesus my Saviour Jesus Christ now there was a man
Jesus Christ oh what a man <start> Oh the sun's gonna shine in my life once more love's gonna live here again
Things're gonna be the way they were before love's gonna live here again
Love's gonna live here love's gonna live here love's gonna live here again
No more loneliness only happiness love's gonna live here again
I hear bells a ringin' I hear birds a singin' love's gonna live here again
I hear bees a hummin' and I know the days a comin' love's gonna live here again
Love's gonna live here
Love's gonna live here <start> Twentyfive minutes past quitting time
Seven of us crammed into that truck of mine
Paying no attention to them highway signs
Going  mile an hour toward that county line
Quick sack  pack back again
It's a Bdouble Edouble are you in
My buddy and their babies letting down their hair
As long as were together it don't matter where
Ain't got a lot of money but we just don't care
Knowing that the fun is in the getting there
Aztec long necks paychecks spent
It's a Bdouble Edouble are you in
Oh I can't stop thinking
What the hell they were drinking
When they made this county dry
I got a week long thirst and what makes it worse
Lord it's my turn to drive
Laughing and a bragging and a' carrying on
We loaded up the wagon and we headed home
I guess half a dozen cases doesn't last that long
Come tomorrow morning it'll be all gone
It's turn around leave town sounds again
Like a Bdouble Edouble are you in <start> My answer machine is feelin' lonely and blue
'Cause it ain't had a message in an hour or two
And my fax machine has tears in its eyes
'Cause there ain't no words burnin' through its wires
Is it something I did
Is it something I said
Is it something I sang
Or is it something you read
Come clean with me or else instead
I'm gonna wash my hands of you
Hey like Elvis said We're goin' separate ways
I'm gonna wash my hands of you <start> I ain't told nobody 'bout the trouble I've got on me
I keep my tears to myself so no one in the world can see
No I ain't let on the truth to a living soul
So how's the radio know
How's the radio know she left
How's the radio know I did her wrong
Every record that DJ spins
Is a goodlovegonebad song
How's the radio know I miss her
And I'd die to tell her so
Oh how's the radio know
They played one about a fool chocked up with regret
And then one about a woman that a man won't ever forget
Yeah backtoback heartbreakers in a row
How's the radio know
How's the radio know she left
How's the radio know I did her wrong
Every record that DJ spins
Is a goodlovegonebad song
How's the radio know I miss her
And I'd die to tell her so
Oh how's the radio know <start> I wanna be with you when the day is done
I wanna be with you when the flowers come
I wanna be with you when the leaves turn brown
I wanna be with you when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
I wanna ride with you in the summer wind
I wanna hold your hand and be your friend
I wanna run with you in the August rain
And make you laugh and make you stay
Will you stay
Chorus So sad but true
There's no time to lose
Forever just aint long enough for me to be with you
I want a warm embrace in the winter snow
I want a morning kiss before you go
I wanna sit with you on a mountainside
And walk with you by the ocean late at night
Late at night
I wanna dream with you when the moon is high
And when you're away I wanna be on your mind
I wanna be with you when thunder falls
And hold you close 'til the rain is gone
'til the rain is gone
Chorus <start> music and lyrics by Corb Lund
There's something about horses especially a paint
Whenever I see horses it reminds me of what I ain't
Cause I am not your lover now and I may never be
But with a couple pinto ponies how things go we'll have to see
Cause they're hitched outside to the rail right now and their silver jangles free
And the saddlebags are snugged right down sugar ride away with me
There's something about horses especially a paint
Whenever I see horses I see a sadness in their face
I was raised with the West around enough to hum the tune
But I never knew the place like the old boys did chinooked and mountain viewed
Cause this was all a cathedral then and the cowboys they all knew
That you can't keep a loop on paradise but she disappeared so soon
She disappeared so soon
There's something about horses especially a paint
Whenever I see horses I see a path I didnt take <start> Merry merry merry go round bring his love back to me
Merry merry merry go round I'm as blue as can be
You promised to love me and never to leave me
To always be true and to never deceive me
And though you're gone now my heart still believes
That's you'll soon be returning to me
Merry merry merry go round...
 ac.guitar 
No use to deny that I went for a ride but it seemed like the right thing to do
And now I'm lost with no place to get off of this merry go round with you
Merry merry merry go round...
Merry merry merry go round merry merry merry go round <start> We'd walk up and down the Concho River
We'd find a soft place to watch the sun go down
So was it me or was it what I could not give you
She left me shattered my life scattered all around
Chorus
She said time would heal my broken heart
and I'd find a true companion for my soul
You know she was right we were wrong
Nothing more than a pretty song
About a boy who loved a girl
In San Angelo
Repeat Intro
When I'd close my eyes I could hear her singing
In the chapel where she said we'd wed someday
It rattled me so to hear them old church bells ringing
Knowing well enough we'd never love that way
Repeat Chorus
Looking back it was a blessing she broke my heart in two
But if I had never lost her baby I'd have never found you
Repeat Chorus
About a boy who once loved a girl in San Angelo <start> Well I wish I had my picture on The Rolling Stone today
I wish that The Enquirer spread a rumor that I was gay
Well I wish I had some buddies some movie stars and such
'Cause I probably wouldn't worry about the two of us as much
And I'd spend all my money on caviar and cocaine
And I would not remember how you broke my heart today
You know I I wish I had a super model so skinny and so wild
And a waitress in Nevada she says she's carrying my child
Well I'd drive down Sunset Boulevard my hair blowin' in the wind
And I'd stop at fancy restaurants and they'd finally let me in
And I'd spend all my money on caviar and cocaine
And I would not remember how you broke my heart today
Yeah I wish I had my picture with the Rolling Stones today
And I wish The Enquirer would spread a rumor that I was gay
I wish I knew a movie star someone like Charlie Sheen
'Cause if he'd hang out with Kato Kaelin well I guess he'd hang out with me
And I'd spend all my money on caviar and Rogaine
And I would not remember how you broke my heart today <start> I need a post I can lean on without it falling a rock I can stand on without it rolling
I need a road I can walk down without it turning
A fire I can feel the glow but not the burning
I don't need love just something to believe in
Where are the lips that told me they'd love me forever
The arms that promised me eternal shelter
Where is the wind that lied to me you'll never be empty
For love is a cherry tree in the land of plenty
But I don't want love just something to believe in
I believed in the sunshine and I saw it turned to rain
I believed in the one I loved but I loved her in vain
Is there no post I can lean on without it falling
No rock I can stand on without it rolling
Is there no road I can walk down without it turning
No fire I can feel the glow but not the burning
I don't want love just something to believe in
Oh Lord give me something to believe in <start> Lately I've found myself fallin'
Deeper in love with you
I'm not the kind of guy
Who gets swept away
So here's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna give you this heart of mine
But that's where I draw the line
Chorus
I'm only gonna give you everything
Take it a mile beyond the end of the road
I'm gonna love you one day past forever
But that's as far as it goes
I know it may not sound like much
But baby make no mistake
I'm gonna treat you with more tenderness
Than any one woman can take
I'm gonna make all your dreams come true
But after that baby I'm through
Chorus
You've got your limits I've got mine
I'm only gonna go the distance
Time after time
Chorus
But that's as far as it goes <start> Like the first apartment that we had
That bompy little couch that made into a bed
Shower down the hall and footsteps through the wood she said it's just fine
Times were hard for us for quite a while
But through those hungry days she faced it with a smile
Not wantin' me to knpow she's carrying my child she tried to ease my mind
And for my woman's love for my woman's love
Each day I thank the Lord above for my sweet woman's love
Through the years of moving town to town
Still searchin' for a dream somehow we never found
And wondering if we would ever settle down her love never died
And if I have many things today I owe it to the love I had along the way
No matter what went wrong no matter come what may she stood by my side <start> I long to be his possession he is my everything
I remember my days of darkness without sunshine or sight to lead my way
Then a whisper of his voice softly called me to the arms of my maker to stay
He is my reason for living he is the king of all kings
I long to be his possession he is my everything
After the lightning and the thunder after the last bell has rung
I want to bow down before Jesus and hear him say well done
He is my reason for living...
I long to be his possession he is my everything <start> Oh you tell me that you love me
Yes you tell me that you care
That tomorrow we'll be married
But tomorrow's never there
Chorus
Oh tomorrow never comes
No tomorrow never comes
Now you tell me that you love me
But tomorrow never comes
Many weeks now have I waited
Many long nights have I cried
Just to see that happy morning
When I'd have you by my side
Chorus
So tomorrow I'll be leaving
Yes tomorrow I'll be gone
And tomorrow you'll be weeping
But tomorrow never comes
Chorus <start> I think I know what you're about to say
I can see it in your eyes and on your face
We swore we never would
So while the words are still unspoken
Don't you think you should
Chorus
Take a breath
Take a moment
Take your time
Before you lie
Cause once you do
Love is different
Everything changes
Between you and I
And it gets easier every time
Oh and you can still change your mind
Before you lie
All I ask of you is honesty
We said that's how this love will always be
So careful what you say
Cause it only takes a half a truth
To throw it all away
Chorus
It's up to you
This can go either way
You get to choose
Which road we take
So
Chorus
Before you lie before you lie <start> If you're lost and you're alone
Let me sing you a song
Oh you're not the only lonely one tonight
I know what you're goin' through
I can sympathize with you
I've been wakin' in your shoes all my life
I was born with a broken heart
Born to lose right from the start
Raised on handmedown blues
That's why I sing the way I do
A sad sixstring and a jukebox voice
I'm the lonely people's choice
I was made to play the part
I was born with a broken heart
If the sun should ever shine in your life
Well friend that's fine
And may you leave behind these
Old troubled times that we've shared
Oh but don't look back for me
I'm where I'm supposed to be
And anywhere there's a lonely street I'll be there
I was born with a broken heart
Born to lose right from the start
Raised on handmedown blues
That's why I sing the way I do
A sad sixstring and a jukebox voice
I'm the lonely people's choice
I was made to play the part
I was born with a broken heart
Yes I was made to play the part
I was born with a broken heart <start> What happened to your mother's love
What happened to your daddy's pride
Although you always said enough
Though they were right by your side
What happened to that ball of fire
It got out on that empty road
Nothing but our own desires
Lighten up this heavy load
Hold on hold on hold on
I know you didn't plan for this
But that's the way it always starts
He's looking for a little kiss
Instead you bought a broken heart
Now you had to build a bridge
Only you can walk across
Wear the tooth until it fits
Pay the price and bear the loss
Hold on hold on hold on
Once you were a little kid
Working on a great big plan
They threw away the simple joys
And now you have to take a stand
Battles rage in your head
You wish you didn't have to fight
Just hold on to my hand instead
Another day goes by tonight
What happened to your mother's love
What happened to your daddy's pride
Way down deep in your inside your blood
Help you through this lonely ride
Hold on hold on hold on
Hold on hold on hold on
Hold on hold on hold on
Hold on <start> 
To have and hold suburban life
Forever live as man and wife
Welcomed by the neighborhood
The neighbors here are really good
They say What's mine is yours
And yours is mine
Swapmeat the American way
You can have it twice a day
Swapmeat the American way
It's indoor recreation at its best
Hold me back it's just too much
I've never seen the like of such
I must admit it beats the bars
No broken hearts or nasty scars
Just carpet burns and wait your turns
Swapmeat the American way
You can have it twice a day
Swapmeat the American way
Ahh it's strictly code of the road
Detectives breaking down the door
The evidence laid on the floor
Pistolpackin' romeos stop illegal loops and holes...
My old man says it's time to go
But I just wants to dosido
I can't stop this jig and jag
I wanna swing my little honey
To the swampmeat rag
Community property it's all in the family
Swapmeat the American way
You can have it twice a day
Swapmeat the American way
Swapmeat the American way
Swapmeat the American way <start> Well I don't wanna be a soldier mamma I don't wanna die
Well I don't wanna be a sailor mamma I don't wanna fly
Well I don't wanna be a failure mamma I don't wanna cry
Well I don't wanna be a soldier mamma I don't wanna die
Oh no oh no oh no oh no
Well I don't wanna be a rich man mamma I don't wanna cry
Well I don't wanna be a poor man mamma I don't wanna fly
Well I don't wanna be a lawyer mamma I don't wanna lie
Well I don't wanna be a soldier mamma I don't wanna die
Oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no
Well I don't wanna be a beggar mamma I don't wanna die
Well I don't wanna be a thief now mamma I don't wanna fly
Well I don't wanna be a churchman mamma I don't wanna cry
Well I don't wanna be a soldier mamma I don't wanna die
Oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no

Well I don't wanna be a sailor mamma I don't wanna fly
Well I don't wanna be a failure mamma I don't wanna cry
Well I don't wanna be a soldier mamma I don't wanna die
Oh no oh no oh no oh no <start> Ten years ago on a cold dark night Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light There were few at the scene but they all agreed That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me The judge he said son what is your alibi If you were somewhere else then you won't have to die I spoke not a word although it meant my life For I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife She walks these hills in a long black veil She visits my grave when the night winds wail Nobody knows nobody sees nobody knows but me The scaffold was high and eternity was near She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans In the long black veil she cries o'er my bones Yes she walks these hills in a long black veil... <start> I know who makes my shoes
Yeah I know who makes my shoes
You may think this information
Something you can't use
But I know who makes my shoes
And I know who grows my food
Yeah I know who grows my food
I went down to the fields
To make sure we were introduced
Now I know who grows my food
What goes out must still come round
And there's so much to be found
So I know who makes the clothes I wear
Yeah I know who makes the clothes I wear
I used to buy them blindly
And I didn't even care
But now I know who make the clothes I wear
And I know who grows my food
And I know it's a small small world
When someone's being used
So I know who makes my shoes... <start> Today I'm like a leaf in autumn never again to know the spring
Today my heart is at rock bottom sorrow nothing else could bring
But those words you told me just today you said I'm only in your way
You left me and what could I say for my world ended today
 steel  guitar 
I turned and gazed into the darkness but no tomorrow could I see
And I remember your remarkets I recall our used to be
I have a treasure yesterday something you can't take away
I'm lost I'll never find my way for my world ended today <start> Last week you told me our love was goin' south
So I tried to follow it I tried to track you down
Thought I caught wind of it outside of San Antone
But it was just a ghost so I kept right on goin'
I drove an told myself you wouldn't lie to me
Tears of confusion fell and I wiped them on my sleeve
Two tanks of gas and a floorboard full of coffee cups
I finally hit the border and Mexico was all there was
As I crossed that river the sun was settin'
But I started seein' the light
I walk those streets and I talked to myself
And I decided I would be all right
I drank some Tequila
I said who needs you
I don't have to do this alone
Me and Mexico are lettin' you go
I bought a big sombrero and made me laugh
Funny I don't think we were ever happy like that
Country full of strangers a thousand miles from home
The first time in a long time that I have felt alone
A band of merry archers was playing in the crowd
I couldn't understand the words but singing right out loud
Here is this border town that's where your memory lays
And when I head back home here's where it's gonna stay
As I cross that river the sun was settin'
But I started seein' the light
I walked those streets and I talked to myself
And I decided I would be all right
I drank some Tequila
I said who needs you
I don't have to do this alone
Me and Mexico are lettin' you go
I drank some Tequila
I said who needs you
I don't have to do this alone
Me and Mexico are lettin' you go
Me and Mexico are lettin' you go

 <start> It's a cold world sometimes I feel all alone
It's a long road that I'm rolling on
And I wonder if I'm on the path I should have taken
And I'm still here even though my heart is breakin'
Chorus Someday I'm gonna find what I'm looking for
Someday I'll find my place in this world
Someday I'm gonna know why I'm here
When I find what I'm looking for
It's a big old world and sometimes I lose my way
But I keep searching and I get closer every day
I can't look back and I can't go back in time
I gotta move one and leave the past behind
Chorus <start> To me you're just as pretty as a speckled pup
That's why I keep on callin' and I can't give up
I'll give you everything I've got from A to Z
If you will only throw your pretty love at me
She's got the kinda smile that would turn you up and down
She's got the kinda love that started men to slippin' round
Well I don't think I'm slippin' but I just have to say
For goodness grace you baby throw love my way
 steel 
I know you got me hangin' from a broken limb
I'm like a little dog I've got to sink or swim
But I could swim the ocean like the Robert E Lee
If you are lonely you throw your pretty love at me
She's got the kinda smile...
 guitar 
I see your eyes are a gleamin' seen 'em gray and brown
If so I'm gonna turn this whole world upside down
I give my share and heaven and I'll get down on my knees
If you will only throw your pretty love at me
She's got the kinda smile... <start> I rode around long enough
With my windows down
Let that breeze roll in carry your perfume out
I took your number and messages off my phone
Oh but you ain't gone
Wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah yeah can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it girl you got me surrounded
Yeah yeah can't get you outta my head
I got you off these walls I got you outta my bed
But girl I'm no better off can't get you outta my head
Seems like your memory has got a map of my mind
No matter where I go you find me every time
Alone or in a crowd I hear you whispering baby
It's driving me crazy
Wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah yeah can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it girl you got me surrounded
Yeah yeah can't get you outta my head
I got you off these walls I got you outta my bed
But girl I'm no better off can't get you outta my head
Damn you're hard to forget
Oh oh oh
Yeah wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah yeah can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it you still got me surrounded
Yeah yeah can't get you outta my head
I got you off these walls I got you outta my bed
But girl I'm no better off can't get you outta my head
You're nowhere close to being gone outta my head
Mm outta my head
No you ain't gone
No you ain't gone
Yeah outta my head <start> It seems that I'm spendin' most of my life
Spendin' ten cents while I'm makin' a dime
Tryin' to make sense out of life's mixed up rhyme meantime I'm watching it go
Clouds in my head they keep crowding my brain
Fair weather thoughts disappear with the rain
I'm chasing rainbows that never remain helplessly watching life go
Watching it go wanting to know where do you go where you've been
 strings 
Poor Cinderella she's bowing her head
Tellin' some stranger what a hard life she's led
Glass slippers fast asleep under the bed sadly I'm watching her go
Prince charming dressed in disarming disguise
Flashin' his charms as he's blinding her eyes
Morning will hear him say his sunshine goodbye just the way I used to go
Watching it go wanting to know where do you go where you've been
 strings 
My Lord it seems I've tried so many things
Walking on crutches and calling them wings
Wondering who's pulling the puppeteer's strings hmm I'm wantin' to know
I feel so confined I keep wanting to roam looking for a life that won't be so alone
Singing in my soul Lord I want to go home knowin' I never can go
Watching it go wanting to know where do you go when you've been <start> You thought you'd found someone
Who could take your cheap romance
Just another name to write down on your wall
You don't know how much you hurt me
When you walked right out the door
But this time my tears won't be those that fall
Cry baby cry this time I'm leavin'
Here's my solong no time for grievin'
My mind's made up to let you go
I can't love the way you do
Cry baby cry this time I'm leavin' you
Those dreams of you are over my heart can't take no more
Your twisted ways of lovin'just ain't fair
You'll find out all by your lonesome
How the true love game is played
While your heart drowns in teardrops of despair
Cry baby cry this time I'm leavin'
Here's my solong no time for grievin'
My mind's made up to let you go
I can't love the way you do
Cry baby cry this time I'm leavin' you
Cry baby cry this time I'm leavin' you <start> Words by Frederico Garcia Lorca
On the darkened stage
Parralla maintains
A conversation with death
And the people are
Inhaling her sobs
And in the green mirror
Her long silk train
Sways back and forth
Lamps of crystal and green mirrors
She calls death but death never comes
Lamps of crystal and green mirrors
She calls death but death never comes
And she calls out again
And she calls out again <start> Can't remember my first mem'ry of you you were always there
And now I know I never knew you well
But I was just a kid and you were always there to pick me up everytime I fell
And you always warmed a blanket to wrap around my feet
When you tucked me into bed to say my prayers
And I'll bet I never thanked you among all the other things
That I took for granted cause you were always there
Yes you were always there so we never took the time
For you to tell me your dreams and me to tell you mine
And we never took the time to talk of love and happiness
And life and death and heartache and pain and loneliness
Why I don't even know if you were happy or if you could have been
Or if you could have one wish what would it be
Or what would you do differently if you could live again
And were you glad that you gave life to me
And I'd give anything to tell you am I glad that you were born
But you'll never hear the words I've learned to say
Cause before I got to know you died of loneliness
And they tell me I grew up and moved away
Yes you were always there so we never took the time
For you to tell me your dreams and me to tell you mine
There were so many things that could have been but now we'll never share
Cause kids don't know much and you were always there
No kids don't know much and you were always there <start> I don't want to wait until it's Friday
Before we hit it sideways
I'm out in your driveway right now
And we ain't gotta wait until it's your birthday
I'm already thirsty time to shut the workday on down
Yeah I just dropped you off but I'm back to pick you up
No I can't get enough need a little more you in my cup
I want to see you move get my hands on you
My little dj vu we do this every night
We can get to feeling alright right now
Turn it on baby til the sun burns out
You ain't gotta say it girl I know what you like
We do this every night
Yeah on this trail trail a little something to sip sip
Don't need no weekend
We do this every night
Hands on your hips and do a little unzip zip
A little bit of your sweet kiss
We do this every night
Turn around down the end of Main Street
When the song is over we put it on repeat repeat
Popping off another can of crazy
Neighbors probably hate me
They don't get the way we do it every night
We can get to feeling alright right now
Turn it on baby til the sun burns out
You ain't gotta say it girl I know what you like
We do this every night
Yeah on this trail trail a little something to sip sip
Don't need no weekend
We do this every night
Hands on your hips and do a little unzip zip
A little bit of your sweet kiss
We do this every night
Yeah I just dropped you off but I'm back to pick you up
No I can't get enough need a little more you in my cup
I want to see you move get my hands on you
My little dj vu we do this every night
We can get to feeling alright right now
Turn it on baby til the sun burns out
You ain't gotta say it girl I know what you like
We do this every night
Yeah on this trail trail a little something to sip sip
Don't need no weekend
We do this every night
Hands on your hips and do a little unzip zip
A little bit of your sweet kiss
We do this every night that's right baby it's going down <start> Here we sit in the darkness where we shouldn't be
I just had to see her and she wanted to see me
Her hand reaches for me I touch then feel the shame
Cause on the other hand she's wearing his ring
Why should I feel so bad if he doesn't know what he has
I don't know him he means nothing to me
Though he waits for her somewhere she don't seem to care
But on the other hand she's wearing his ring
She lives a double life and she could never be my wife so what am I doing to me
Someone waits for me at home with one hand on the phone
But on the other hand she's wearing my ring
But on the other hand she's wearing my ring <start> 
Your trembling hands held me near
Your soft warm lips whispered in my ear
You said you'd always love me
And we'd always be together
And you promised me your love would last forever
Is forever longer than always
You're gone from me now and you have been for days
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay
Unless forever is longer than always
Is forever longer than always
You're gone from me now and you have been for days
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay
Unless forever is longer than always
Is forever longer than always <start> Love is like a young tree that lives or dies and then becomes a mem'ry of tragedy
Soon you'll be far away and free forever gone but you'll always be a part of me
Tomorrow you'll be leaving my world but I'll keep loving the girl who's with me today
Sweetheart don't throw yourself away
Sweetheart don't throw yourself away
Oh let your pride be led astray by stranger called shame
Sweetheart I know the loneliness have magnified your emptiness
But don't let it disgrace your name I mean what I say
Sweetheart don't throw yourself away
Sweetheart don't throw yourself away <start> Bye bye love bye bye happiness hello loneliness I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye love bye bye sweet caress hello emptiness I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye
There goes my baby with someone new he sure feel happy I sure look blue
He was my baby till she walked in goodbye to romance that might have been
Bye bye love
I'm through with romance I'm through with love
I'm through with counting the stars above
I guess the reason why I'm so free is both my babies walked out on me
Bye bye love
Bye bye my love goodbye bye bye my love goodbye bye bye my love goodbye <start> Baby all these city lights
Are losing their shine
I need a little bit a get outta here
A little slow unwind
A little salt air and a sand bar
A lawn chair and a guitar
Singing shalalalalalala
All night long
All night
Chorus
I wanna get high
On some low country
Where the sun meets the water
And the nights get hotter
Sounds right on the money
Let's let that tide take us for a ride
Girl wherever it wants to
I wanna get high
On some low country with you
Down there where the warm wind blows
Through the cypress trees
You take your worries like the pennies in your pocket
And you you throw 'em in the sea
Get a sweet buzz from your long kiss
Better than any rum hitting my lips
Singing lalalalalalala
All night long
All night
Repeat Chorus
Ain't it funny how life can be crazy
Come on let's get gone
'Cause the days are getting long and the nights are getting hazy
Come on let's hold on
Repeat Chorus
Low country with you oh yeah
Low country with you
My low country with you <start> Here we are again going in this cheap place
What if was seen by a friend and they recognize our face
We both know that it's wrong we both should be at home
This time has gotta be our last time
I know that you want me just as much as I want you
You've got a family and I've got one too
From now on we must stay apart we just can't break all their hearts
This time has gotta be our last time
This time has gotta be our last time we'll put our rings that own our hands
Your conscience hurt you well mine does too
I'm not this kind of woman and I'm not this kind of man
We just can't go on cheating neither of us is this kind
This time has gotta be our last time this time has gotta be our last time <start> Long stem things of beauty
Created by the good Lord
Cut down in the prime of their lives
Boxed up wrapped in paper
Delivered to your front door
Just to wind up in your garbage can outside
Chorus
Tell me how many flowers have to die
Before you give this love another try
I've asked you to forgive me at least  dozen times
Tell me how many flowers have to die
I'm crazy and I'm desperate
I had you and I blew it
And right now I've got nothing left to lose
I've got a Visa in my wallet
And I'm not afraid to use it
How long the needless violence lasts
Is really up to you
Chorus <start> Every time we say goodbye I die a little
Every time we say goodbye I wonder why a little
Why the gods above me who must be in the know
Think so little of me they allow you to go
When your near there's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer
But how strange the change from major to minor
Every time we say goodbye
Music.
Why the gods above me who must be in the know
Thinks so little of me they allow you to go
When your near there's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer
But how strange the change from major to minor
Every time we say goodbye
Every time we say goodbye <start> Yeah
In the circles I've been running
I've covered many miles
And I could search forever for what's right before my eyes
Just when I thought I'd found it
It was nothing like I'd planned
When I got my heart around it it slipped right through my hands
Here with you I feel it
I close my eyes and see it
In a midnight talk in a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms that's where it is
When we're tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush that's where it is
That's where it is
When I'm crashing through the madness
Not sure who I'm supposed to be
When I'm caught up in the darkness
It's your hand that's leading me
You bring me back to solid ground
You lift me up right here right now
In a midnight talk in a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms that's where it is
When we're tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush that's where it is
It's a lifetime thrill
When tiding braces
The biggest things in the smallest places
In a midnight talk in a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms that's where it is
When we're tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush that's where it is
In the sweetest smile on a night like this
And a tender touch that's where it is
When we're tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush that's where it is
That's where it is <start> Hurts so bad you don't come around here anymore
Worse than that nothing's really helping
I've been thinking about drinking again
It's all right if you've finally stopped caring
Just don't go and tell someone that does
'Cause even though I know there's hope in
every morning song
I have to find that melody alone
Her name became the flame unto the fire
A magpie on a wire warned of those
dead unto the high shamelessly alive unto the low
It's all right if you've finally stopped caring
Just don't go and tell someone that does
'Cause even though I know there's hope in
every morning song
I have to find that melody alone
We can go ahead if no one notices
what's the point of it I have to ask
how you learn to see hope eternally
when you're sure to be leaving last
Hurt so bad more than I expected that it would
Worse than that it seems to be lasting
just a little longer than it should
It's all right if you've finally stopped caring
Just don't go and tell someone that does
'Cause even though I know there's hope in
every morning song
I have to find that melody alone
I have to sing the melody alone <start> Just like a rerun movie
I see that scene again
And that feeling shoots right through me
'Cause this time I know the end
And I've seen it played so many times
And I've watched it frame by frame
And I don't have to guess who loses
And I know who'll feel the pain
Chorus
You're gonna leave me again
Just like you did the time before
This is the start of the end
The end of me when you walk out that door
I think I'll go down to the picture show
See if they're playin' somethin' new
Maybe one with a happy ending
And I'll pretend it's me and you
But I know that it's just makebelieve
So I won't even try
To tell myself that you're not gonna leave
And that you'll never say goodbye
Chorus <start> Gonna find me a bluebird let him sing me a song
Cause my heart's been broken much too long
Gonna chase me a rainbow through a heaven of blue
Cause I'm all through crying over you
There was a time my love was needed my life completed my dreams came true
Then came the time my life was haunted my love unwanted all for you
Gonna find me a bluebird let him sing me a song
Cause my heart's been broken much too long
There was a time <start> The jujekox just told my life story told it in the words of a song
So I'll have another drink to the jukebox and one to the man that wrote the song
So hear Mr Jukebox please take my last dime
Tell me the story of my life one more time
Bring back the mem'ries of the past that was wrong

So hear Mr Jukebox please take my last dime
Tell me the story of my life one more time
Bring back the mem'ries of the past that was wrong
Here's my last drink to you then goodnight and so long <start> I've held it all inward
Lord knows I've tried
It's an awful awakenin'
In a country boy's life
When you look in the mirror
In total surprise
At the hair on your shoulders
And the age in your eyes.
Amanda light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentle man's wife
Amanda light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentle man's wife.
Well the measure of people
Don't understand
The pleasures of life
In a hillbilly band
I got my first guitar
When I was fourteen
Now I'm crowding thirty
And still wearin' jeans.
Amanda light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentle man's wife
Amanda light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentle man's wife. <start> Used heart for sale

The first owner Peggy treated it rough
She took it over some rough roads
She skipped town when it broke down
She never paid off what she owed

Used heart for sale

Whoa how she made it shine

Used heart for sale <start> Saw a girl on the street from my home
Like a fire on the hillside she shown
And I knew right then that my best days were gone
And I'd been been in the lowlands too long
Chorus
Oh I've been in the lowlands too long
Oh I know I know that I should go
And I've been in the lowlands too long
This is not how it was at the start
There's a doubt and a blame in my heart
And it's no one else no fault but my own
And I've been in the low lands too long
Chorus
What is this weight in my mind
And what is this new sense of time
It's the open fields and the friends that are gone
And I've been in the lowlands too long
I can sing out at all sing a song
I can do nothing all the day long
But I can't so right and I know I'm wrong
And I've been in the lowlands too long
Chorus <start> My mama always told me better than to play with a loaded gun
If I'd've just listened to her she'd've never had a prisoner for a son
The picture's still in front of my eyes the echo in my ears
When the jury said he's guilty and the judge said ninetynine years
Oh for ninetynine years I'll watch the sunrise over that some old sea
Ninetynine years nothing but an empty cell for company
Yet there's not very much that stands between me and the freedom I hold dear
Just a thousand bars a big brick wall and a sentence of ninetynine years
I kissed my darling on her tender lips and they took me by the hand
I had a nice little ride on a ferry boat to the rock where the prison stands
The warden said as he locked the door I hope you'll like it here
Just make yourself a home you're gonna be with us ninetynine years
I've almost forgotten what my real name is been a number for so long
Making little bitty rocks out of great big rocks gets old as the days wear on
But I'll do my best for ninetynine years just try to stay alive
Cause the Governor said if I'd be good I'd get out in ninetyfive
Oh for ninetynine years... <start> I'm gonna lay down my old guitar
Gonna lay down my old guitar
Oh I wish I could tie it to my side
And take it along with me
There's no one to cry for me
There's no one to cry for me
I've wandered so far away don't you see
And there's no one to cry for me
I'm sick in a lonesome bed
I'm sick in a lonesome bed
There's no one to hold my aching head
And I'm sick in a lonesome bed
I'm telling this world goodbye
I'm telling this world goodbye
I'm telling the world and my dear little girl
I'll soon tell them all goodbye <start> 
One kiss for old time's sake just like it used to be
One kiss for old time's sake could bring you back to me
If you give me a chance to love you one more time
Maybe my lips on yours would change your mind
And you would know how much I want you I need you I love you
Oh my darling please grant me this
One kiss for old time's sake just like it used to be
One kiss for old time's sake could bring you back to me
If there's a spark of love still left from our romance
You owed it to your heart to give me one more chance
Oh can't you see how much I want you I need you I love you
Oh my darling please grant me this <start> 
Randy in your eyes I see the promise of a future
The promise of a love like I have never known
Randy cradled in your arms I feel like I'm in heaven
And heaven knows I've needed someone like you for so long
So Randy take me with you for that's where I want to be
Teach me how to fly on these new wings you've given me
Randy let me show you what your love has meant to me
Randy let me be the only one you'll ever need
Randy you have given me reason to live again
Reason to love again and reason to smile
Randy you have given me new inspiration
New dreams to dream and a reason to try
So Randy take me with you for that's where I want to be
Teach me how to fly on these new wings you've given me
Randy let me show you what your love has meant to me
Randy let me be the only one you'll ever need <start> Well the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times
Carried the story in BIG HEADLINES
How Kansas City George was robbed that day
When Tar Baby Billy took his bat away
It was two men out in the top a' the ninth
It was one a' them classic settin's
The Goose on the mound in that Big Apple town
And George is up there battin'
As the crowd chants Goose
He turns it loose
With fire and smoke and ash
George sends it deep
In the right field seats
Another timely crash
As he rounded third and he headed on home
Was a gleam in Billy's eye
Dick wondered What's he up to now
I know this guy's real sly.
Billy grabbed the bat as both teams sat
In awe upon the benches
Says There ya are That there's pine tar
An' it's a whole lot more'n eighteen inches
Chorus
Tar Baby Billy can you hear our song
Did you cry about the game last night
Cry Baby Billy tell us all what's wrong
All you wanna do is fight
You like a child kickin' dirt on the umpire's shoes
That's the way you've always been
So now we're gonna take that pine tar rag
And rub it in your face again
So Tim thought it through and he asked the crew
Then with bat in hand he shouted
You're out The home run just don't count
I'm gonna have ta disallow it
Well the sky was clear and the day was hot
But George was even hotter
'Till Lee got wise and said Hey you guys
This claim ain't agonna hold water.
Chorus
Tar Baby Billy can you hear our song
Did you cry about the game last night
Cry Baby Billy tell us all what's wrong
All you wanna do is fight
You like a child kickin' dirt on the umpire's shoes
That's the way you've always been
So now we're gonna take that pine tar rag
And rub it in your face again
Well the fans was riled and suits was filed
To create a long deelay
Then Billy's team apparently
Was just afraid to play
Now the stage was set and Billy bet
That he had the upper hand
But Billy was fooled when the big court ruled
You gonna play this game as planned
Chorus
Well Tar Baby Billy can you hear our song
Did you cry about the game last night
Cry Baby Billy tell us all what's wrong
All you wanna do is fight
You like a child kickin' dirt on the umpire's shoes
That's the way you've always been
So now we're gonna take that pine tar rag
And rub it in your face again
With affidavits 
That George had touched 'em all
The umpire said We a step ahead.
Gonna put an end to Billy Ball.
We done heard the call for Billy Ball
We ain't never gonna hear it again
Just like the cheer for Billy's Beer
When the Democrats was in.
Now the game they played that summer day
Won't be famous for the scores
But the incidents that have happened since
Will be remembered as TAR WARS
Chorus
Tar Baby Billy can you hear our song
Did you cry about the game last night
Cry Baby Billy tell us all what's wrong
All you wanna do is fight
You like a child kickin' dirt on the umpire's shoes
That's the way you've always been
So now we're gonna take that pine tar rag
And rub it in your face again <start> 
I thought I saw the promise of forever in your eyes
I thought that I was sure of what I saw
You led me to believe that I was special in your life
So I left my heart wide open for the fall
I thought I'd found a safe and loving place inside your heart
And I was warm and willing any time
The same soft lips that kissed me sweet were lying from the start
But I swear I thought your love was genuine
What a heartache you turned out to be
What a heartache what a heartache
Like a switchblade that cuts quick and deep
Oh what a heartache what a heart break
Love ain't always what it appears to be
Oh what a heartache you turned out to be
It just goes to show that you never can tell
'Cause I really thought that I knew you well
I still can't believe I could be deceived so easily
Are all these wishes I'm wishin' to myself
Just rusty coins in a wishin' well
Wishes come true they come false as well
It's too late for you and me
Oh what a heartache you turned out to be
What a heartache what a heartache
Love is twofaced and easy to deceive
Oh what a heartache what a heartache
What a mistake to think I could believe
What a heartache what a heartache
Like a switchblade that cuts quick and deep
Ooh what a heartache you turned out to be
What a heartache what a heartache
What a heartache what a heartache
What a heartache.
Ooh what a heartache you turned out to be
Ooh what a heartache
Oh what a heartache
What a heart break you turned out to be <start> Girl I've made a name everybody writes off
An openroad hard case a honky tonk lost cause
The fate I'm lookin' at there ain't know way around
A long and lonely path I'm destined to go down
Chorus
Yeah there ain't much of nothin' in me
Left to be saved but baby I bet
If you could love somebody like me
There might be hope for me yet
Hope for me yet
Always livin' fast and only thinkin' short term
I never could get past a bridge I didn't burn
I'm just a worn out pair of boots and a beatup old guitar
A handful of country tunes and a hardluck kind of heart
Chorus
Girl you just might be that outside chance for me
Yeah you're the one good shot at redemption that I've got
Yeah there ain't much of nothin' in me
Left to be saved but baby I bet
If you could love somebody like me
There might be...
Chorus
Hope for me yet
There's hope for me yet <start> Well I changed my ways to please that woman
But I could never be good enough
I gave up drinkin' and took up churchin'
And for awhile it wasn't tough
But barkeep I've made a decision
After doing the best I could
That for better or worse
I'm gonna be bad for good
So bring on the whiskey
Turn up the jukebox loud
These boots were made for tonkin'
Warn every woman around
I'm gonna wind it up tonight
A little tighter than I should
Yeah for better or worse
I'm gonna be bad for good
I really like my reputation
And how I'm known all over town
Of being the first in my generation
To close every single honky tonk down
I'm gonna be a tough act to follow
Doin' what I said I would
Yeah for better or worse
I'm gonna be bad for good
So bring on the whiskey
Turn up the jukebox loud
These boots were made for tonkin'
Warn every woman around
I'm gonna wind it up tonight
A little tighter than I should
Yeah for better or worse
I'm gonna be bad for good
Oh somebody be bad
I'm gonna wind it up tonight
A little tighter that I should
Yeah for better or worse
I'm gonna be bad for good
Yeah for better or worse
I'm gonna be bad for good <start> I don't hang around that place no more
I'm tired of wearing circles in the floor
And I don't carry myself very well
But I've gotten so much braver
Can you tell
I'm happy can't you see
I'm all right but I miss you Amber lee
And I lined my secrets up all one by one
I put em all away when I was done
And I would really love to hear your voice sometime
To close a little distance in my mind
I'm happy can't you see
I'm all right but I miss you Amber Lee
Where have you been all these years
And how could you just disappear
And when did you stop missing me
I'm happy can't you see
I'm all right but I miss you Amber Lee
I'm all right but I miss you Amber Lee <start> Everywhere I go everyone I know seems to remind me that you are gone
Nothing that I do is the same without you it just reminds me that you are gone
Can someone see how I cry does anyone care if I live or die
Everytime I find love it's the same not real love it just reminds me that you are gone
 ac.guitar 
It just reminds me that you are gone
Can someone see how I cry...
It just reminds me that you are gone <start> Well I don't know how it happened
Must have been something I said
We had some words she said some things
I guess I must have lost my head
It's been a week since I left her
And I can't go on this way
I'll call her up and swallow my pride
When she says hello I'll say
I... want you back again
Oooohhhh what a fool I've been
I... won't do that again
My tears won't stop and my heart won't mend
I want you back again
So I gather up all of my courage
And I found my last dime
I need it so  but God only knows
If we can make up this time
I tremble as I dial her number
Ohh I hope I'm not to late
I say it's me and I hold my breath
And softly I hear her say
I... want you back again
Ohh what a fool I've been
I... won't do that again
My tears won't stop and my heart won't mend
I want you back again... <start> If I needed you would you come to me
Would you come to me for to ease my pain
If you needed me I would come to you
I would swim the seas for to ease your pain
Well the night's forlorn and the morning's born
And the morning shines with the lights of love
And you'll miss sunrise if you close your eyes
And that would break my heart in two
If I needed you would you come to me
Would you come to me for to ease my pain
If you needed me I would come to you
I would swim the seas for to ease your pain
Baby's with me now since I showed her how
To lay her lilly hand in mine
Who would I'll agree she's a sight to see
A treasure for the poor to find <start> Well I'm making out my list
For ole St.Nick tonight
But I'm afraid what I want this year
Can't be had
But Santa he's the kind
When he makes up his mind
Wishes can come true
And I bet my Christmas stockin'
If my wish don't come knockin'
He's gonna be blue
So baby come home
If you don't wanna see Santa Claus cry
He can't see where he's going
When it's snowing
If there tears in his eyes
And don't you know his ho ho ho will be
A sad sad sigh
So baby come back to me
If you don't wanna see Santa Claus cry
And don't you know his ho ho ho will be
A sad sad sigh
So baby come back to me
If you don't wanna see Santa Claus cry
So baby come back to me
If you don't wanna see Santa Claus cry <start> Let it be Christmas everywhere
In the hearts of all people both near and a far
Christmas everywhere
Feel the love of the season wherever you are
On the small country roads lined with green mistletoe
Big city streets where a thousand lights glow
Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
Let it be Christmas
Christmas everywhere
Let it be Christmas everywhere
With the gold and silver the green and the red
Christmas everywhere
In the smiles of all children asleep in their beds
In the eyes of young babies their first fallen snow
Elderlys memories that never grow old
Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
Let it be Christmas
Christmas everywhere
Let it be Christmas everywhere
In the songs that we sing and the gifts that we bring
Christmas everywhere
In what this day means and what we believe
From the sandy white beaches where blue water rolls
Snow covered mountains and valleys below
Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
Let it be Christmas
Christmas everywhere
Christmas everywhere
Christmas everywhere <start>

Rockin' chairs rockin' babies rockabye rock of ages

Through our rockin' years <start> The only difference between men and boys
Is the size of their feet and the price of their toys
Always horsin' around makin' too much noise
Ain't it funny how men'll be boys
Kickin' tire round the pick up truck
Drinkin' been and just cuttin' up
Smokin' and jokin' out behind the shed
Cussin' a blue streak till the girls turn red
The only diffrence between men and boys
Is the size of their feet and the price of their toys
Always horsin' around makin' too much noise
Ain't it funny how men'll be boys
Sneakin' out of the house tryin' to have a little fun
Lookin' for somethin' that he ain't done
Look what the cat dragged in at the break of dawn
He ain't passed out he's campin' on the lawn
The only difference between men and boys
Is the size of their feet and the price of their toys
Always horsin' around makin' too much noise
Ain't it funny how men'll be boys
You can spend a lifetime growin' up
You can spend a lifetime in a rut
When it comes a time to make a choice
Most men would just as soon be boys
The only difference between men and boys
Is the size of their feet and the price of their toys
Always horsin' around makin' too much noise
Ain't it funny how men'll be boys <start> Like that old Titanic
Running full steam ahead
You fogged up my mind
With love words you said
I could not see the danger
I got myself in
Till my ship was sinking
And I couldn't swim
Chorus
I didn't know my heart
Was in harm's way
I couldn't see the truth
Till it was in my face
If I'd seen it coming
I could have turned away
I didn't know my heart
Was in harm's way
Now the door went under
In an ocean of regret
With no hope of rescue
From love I can't forget
I never knew just what hit me
To far gone to say
I never knew my heart
Was in harm's way
Chorus x <start> Once I stood in the night with my head bowed low
In the darkness as black as the sea
And my heart was afraid and I cried oh Lord don't hide your face from me
Hold my hand all the way every hour every day from here to the great unknown
Take my hand let me stand where no one stands alone
 guitar 
Like a king I may live in a palace so tall with great riches to call my own
But I don't know a thing in this whole wide world that's worse than being alone
Hold my hand all the way... <start> If a girl could be made of clay then I could mould that girl my way
I got her picture in my mind but there's no need to waste my time
Cause I got you and God knew what to do when he made you
Come the day that you were born an angel took an earthly form
Cause if you take one little girl add all the wonders of the world
Then I'd have you and God knew what to do when he made you
God created the seven wonders in his usual style
Wrapped them up in the piece of sunshine put them in your smile
So if the sun don't ever shine I don't worry cause I got mine
When I got you and God knew what to do when he made you
God created the seven wonders... <start> 
Just because I asked a friend about her
Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I rang her number by mistake today
She thinks I still care
Just because I haunt the same old places
Where the mem'ries of her lingers everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be
She thinks I still care
But if she's happy thinking I still need her
Then let that silly notion bring her cheer
But how could she ever be so foolish
Where could she get such an idea
Just because I asked a friend about her
Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I saw her then went all to pieces
She thinks I still care
She thinks I still care <start> Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more
My woman done left and took all of the reasons
That I was workin' for
You better not try to stand in my way
When I'm walkin' out the door
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more
Well I've been working in this factory
Pretty close to  years
I've seen some of my best friends women
Drownin' in a pool of tears
I've seen a lot of kinfolks dyin'
I had a lot of bills to pay
Lord I'd give the shirt right often my back
If I had the guts to say say what
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more
My woman's done left and took all of the reasons
That I was workin' for
You better not try to stand in my way
When I'm walkin' out the door
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more
The foreman is a regular S.O.B.
And the night boss he's a fool
He got himself a brand new flattop haircut
Lord he really thinks that's cool
One of these days I'm gonna blow my top
And that's shockin' he's gonna pay it
Well I can't wait to see their faces
When I get the nerve to say say what
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more
My woman done left and took all of the reasons
That I was workin' for
You better not try to stand in my way
When I'm walkin' out the door
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more
Take this job and shove it <start> You've gone so far away my darling
Each time I think of you I cry
I press your picture to my bosom
Then I feel that you're close by
Years have passed you've not returned dear
Now they say that you have died
But your soul will live forever
Now I know you'll be close by
I saw you last while you were leaving
The tears from you I tried to hide
You took me in your arms and said dear
Your memory I keep close by
They buried you in a lonely graveyard
And a spot they left beside
There I'll sleep 'till Jesus calls us
So that we can be close by <start> She's got butterflies you've got 'em too
You look into her eyes and it's quite a view
You see forever all mapped out
I hope you know what you're talking about
It ain't the falling in love that pulls you through
When the times get tough what you gonna do
To make it last day out and day in
It ain't the falling in love it's the stayin'
You call each others' faults endearing traits
Until the day they all start to irritate
When the new is getting gone
That's when you learn how to keep hangin on
Through the ins and outs
Through the waves of doubt
That's what love's about <start> It's just a little bitty pissant country place
Ain't nothin' much to see
No drinking allowed we get a nice quiet crowd plain as it can be
It's just a piddly squatin' old time country place
Ain't nothing too high tone
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
But there's nothing dirty going on
Nothing dirty going on
We get simple farmers local business men
Congress folks from Austin young boys looking for sin
Now we used to get a lot of rough necks when the oil boom was high
By pay day id get a little rowdy thank God the field ran dry
Chorus
It's just a little bitty pissant country place nothing much to see
No drinking allowed we get a nice quiet crowd plain as it can be
It's just a piddly squatin old time country place nothing too high tone
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill but there's nothing dirty going on
I don't hire no married girl they're not on the ball
They got homes and husbands they're not stable at all
You know they don't understand a thing about a proper business day
Now what's the point in opening up the store if you give the goods away
Chorus
Keep your language clean girls keep your bedrooms neat
And don't hang around the town cafe and say hi on the street
Mind you P's and Q's and manners and you don't need no other tools
Cause every girl that lives here knows my special nono rules
Yea every girl that lives here knows Miss Mona's nono rules
Ruby Ray start em
Beds are not to be wallowed in
That's the kind of thing that big fat lazy hogs do
And it don't make money
Betrix
I won't tolerate no tying up my telephone with other people's business
Eloise honey
And please don't show us no tattoos
No hearts and flowers on your thigh
It's downright tacky
Brands for the cattle and that ain't what we're selling at Miss Mona's
Do you catch my drift
I pay the food and the rent and the utilities
You keep your mind on your work responsibilities
Don't let your mouth overload your capabilities
And we can get along
Dawn
Any bad habits you come in with get rid off right now
Tatty Joe
I can't stand no chewing gum it looks just like a cow
Lindy Lue
Any one taking sick leave better be real sure they're sick
And every time you hear that bell...
You better get here double quick
And as for pimps
Pimps are something you don't need
To get your daily business done
Are you listening girls
Keep them leaches and blood suckers off the back roads
I know how to use a gun
And nobody messes with my girls
And any questions you might have about the way I run this place
Don't grip and whine behind my back
Just tell me face to face I'm openminded say it all
Then go upstairs and pack the door's that away
She pays the food and the rent and the utilities
We keep our mind on our work responsibilities
Don't let your mouth overload your capabilities
And we can get along
Chorus
It's just a little bitty pissant country place nothing much to see
No drinking allowed we get a nice quiet crowd plain as it can be
It's just a piddly squatin no time country place nothing to hide at all
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
But there's nothing dirty going on
Nothing dirty going on <start> Sadness just makes me sigh
I've come to say goodbye
Altho' I go I've got those farewell blues.
Those farewell blues make me yearn
That parting kiss seems to burn.
Farewell dearie Someday I will return.
Dreaming of you is sweet
Someday again we'll meet. <start> When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them ol' cotton fields back home
It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them ol' cotton fields back home
When them cotton bolls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them ol' cotton fields back home
It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them ol' cotton fields back home <start> All of me loves all of you
Every part of me
Down to the heart of me
Loves you through and through
Now wanting you it's all I do
All of my loves all of you
O' I have hear those tender words
But my heart wasn't listenin'
Till I found you I never knew
Just what I was missin'
O' I have hear those tender words
But my heart wasn't listenin'
Till I found you I never knew
Just what I was missin'
All of me loves all of you <start> Take these chains from my heart and set me free
You've grown cold and no longer care for me
All my faith in you is gone but the heartaches linger on
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take these tears from my eyes and let me see just a spark of the love that used to be
If you love somebody new let me find a new love too
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
 steel 
Give my heart just a word of sympathy be as fair to my heart as you can be
Then if you no longer care for the love that's beating there
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take these chains... <start> In a dusty old saloon out west in Abilene
Dreaming dreams at forty that he dreamed at seventeen
He sings and plays his guitar for all of you bucks tonight
Still tryin' to be a star and see his name in lights
Somewhere the organ's playin' a hymn of salvation
As she sings so low for the congregation
In her mind she's at the Opry and her friends filled the pews
And she can hear them saying she's Loretta No.
Looking in Nashville mirrors you can close your eyes and dream who you are
Looking in Nashville mirrors it's easy to see the reflection of the star
Loadin' steel in Pittsburg savin' every dime he raise
He's headin' south to Nashville prayin' for the break
Every song he's written it's gonna be a country hit
He hates to leave his family but his dream won't let him quit
In a honky tonk in Georgia she looks old at sixteen
Lord she hates the spotlights she don't even like the scene
But daddy's pushin' her to be the star he can't be
Those lyin' Nashville mirrors there's so easy to believe
Looking in Nashville mirrors...
Excepting his award on the Grammy show tonight
That cowboy's now an outlaw stoned out of his mind
He's found that a star only lights an empty space
And the mirrors that he dreamed in he can't find the nerve to face
Looking in Nashville mirrors...
Sometimes it takes a lifetime to see the fool you are <start> Said you wanna stand there
With your arms around me...
But I can't feel you...
It's kinda like a dream...
Then you walk out with another..
Lord my jaw hits the floor...
It's kinda like a dream...
Said little angel with the bottle...
I don't love you anymore...
Yeah I spent some time out with the devil
Oh but you don't hurt me anymore...
Yeah I waste my time...
And I waste my money...
On a broken dream...
'Cause you wouldn't wear my ring...
Baby give me back my ring...
One day you'll look back...
Baby when you're all alone...
Just wonderin' to yourself...
Just where in the hell did I have gone...
And I'll be down the road
Like a thousand times before...
And you'll be sittin' home...
With your jaw on the floor...
Said little angel with the bottle...
I don't love you anymore...
Yeah I spent some time out with the devil
Oh but you don't hurt me anymore...
Yeah I waste my time...
And I waste my money...
On a broken dream...
'Cause you wouldn't wear my ring...
Baby give me back my ring...
Said little angel with the bottle...
I don't love you anymore...
Yeah I spent some time out with the devil
Oh but you don't hurt me anymore...
Said little angel with the bottle...
I don't love you anymore...
Yeah I spent some time out with the devil
Oh but you don't hurt me anymore... <start> I don't want another fruitcake
I don't need another ugly tie
No
Heard they had a sale on go karts
Down at Wal Mart
Ho ho a good buy.
Got no money in my pocket.
Can't believe it's Christmastime.
It's the crowds that bug me
Stuck in traffic like this.
It's kids causing a commotion.
It's shop at your own risk.
It's that Tickle Me Elmo
It's  unfindable
Christmas Christmas
Unshoppable
Christmas Christmas
It can make a feller uptight.
I must have been to fifteen stores or more.
All I wanted was a Lite Brite
But they sold out last night of course.
Time I buy my kids a swing set
I'd be broke forevermore
Tis the season of givin'.
Tis that time of year.
Twas the night before Christmas
Twas a pain in the rear.
It's the credit card payment
Its  unpayable
Christmas Christmas
Returnable.
Christmas Christmas
You'll see Santa hop the rooftops
Rudolph's nose will be glowin' so bright.
There's a whole lot of parents losin' sleep
Nuthin' silent about this night
Oh Christmas is pure promotion
Let us not forget why
We're all out shoppin'.
We're all out buyin'.
It's the offkey caroling.
Grandma's mistletoe kiss.
It's that one string of light bulbs
You can never get lit.
It's that gallon of egg nog
It's so  undrinkable.
Christmas Christmas
Decorateable.
Christmas Christmas
It's the things you buy me baby.
It's the things I buy you darlin' yeah.
It's the crowds that bug me
Stuck in traffic like this.
It's kids causing a commotion.
It's shop at your own risk.
Its that Faith Hill CD.
They're all sold outable.
Christmas Christmas
Beautiful.
Christmas Christmas
It's the things you buy me baby.
It's the things I buy you darlin' yeah. <start> 
They tell me I'm the talk of the town
I've been staying home alone every night
It's nobody's business where I'm bound
As if to be alone and lonely just ain't right
On a old freight train moving down the line
I'm counting each day and every minute that your away
I've never been the stay at home kind
But for you it's just the price that I pay
It's just the price I pay for loving you
The price I pay for needing you so much
The price I pay for needing you
And putting all this time between us
I knew I was in trouble when we met
Dark clouds all around me I couldn't find the light
The hard time ain't hard to forget
I believe in love at first sight
I put my heart and soul on the line
And know your love is with me every day
Your picture always there on my mind
But for you it's just the price that I pay
It's just the price I pay for loving you
The price I pay for needing you so much
The price I pay for needing you
And putting all this time between us <start> Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire the ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire the ring of fire
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh but the fire went wild
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire the ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire the ring of fire
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire the ring of fire
The ring of fire <start> Raise a white sail if you love me
A black sail if you don't
Seal me up in an impregnable tower
Or surround me with an impassable moat
I've heard all the stories told about love

But there is one love of which I'm sure
Your fear as honed as a battle axe
I'll bear my neck I'll wear the scar
And if my nerve should fail the task
I know your faith will not roam too far
I've heard all the stories told about love

But this tale of love is one we've just begun
I sold had her tristan
But love potions are not what we need
And paris had his helen
But it was infatuation that was plain to see
What I desire is your trust to inspire
This love for you which grows in me
Plant a rose tree on his grave
And on mine plant a vine
As seasons pass and markers fade
Watch them slowly intertwine
I've heard all the stories told about love

But our love is a vow which has been wrought
From heart to heart <start> Guess who called me yesterday apologized for goin' away
And said I'm still the one he's dreamin' of
And did he ever sound so low when he said I need you so
He wants to come back home in the name of love
Guess who said that he was wrong and even cried on the telephone
Said he'd be as true as stars above
Guess who said he would do right if I'd let him come home tonight
He wants to come back home in the name of love
Guess who's gonna let him come back to her life once more
Guess you're right it's me and I'll be waitin' at the door
No more sadness only smiles he'll be here in a little while
Tonight he's comin' home in the name of love
No more sadness only smiles he'll be here in a little while
Tonight he's comin' home in the name of love
Tonight he's comin' home in the name of love
Guess who called me yesterday apologized for goin' away
But tonight he's comin' home in the name of love <start> Jack's sittin' back in a pitch black box
When some light shines through a crack in the corner
Will he take the risk break out of this
Place that he hates or will he just sit and wonder
If he springs out there's no doubt that his system might be shocked
But he's afraid what it might take for him to unlock
The box
You can be free if you want to
Travel outside the lines
If you dare to be individual
No tellin' who's inside
The box
Jacklyn's got green hair piercings everywhere
She's not scared to be different
She does what she loves above all
There's not any walls in her environment
She's herself no one else she knows you only get one time
To wear your shoes in life and view the world from outside
The box
You can be free if you want to
Travel outside the lines
If you dare to be individual
No tellin' who's inside
The box
You can be free if you want to
Travel outside the lines
If you dare to be individual
No tellin' who's inside
The box
The box
The box <start> Cross around your neck but the way that you're dancin'
Girl its flirtin' with the dirty side
Bet that cotton dress is hidin' a tattoo
That you're wantin' somebody to find
Bought you a shot of whiskey
I thought you'd be sippin' it
When I turned around you'd already finished it finished it
You're the good you're the good
You're the good kinda bad
You're the best shot of trouble I ever had
Got a mile wide wild side a beautiful crazy
Wherever you wanna take me
I'm in for a ride on the dangerous side
I'm ready for the devil in that angel smile
I can see you being the fix I gotta have
'Cause girl you're the good kinda bad
Keep every boy in town wrapped around your finger
But there ain't no diamond ring
You kind of like the thought of forever
But you love that freedom thing
Strap fallin' off your shoulder
Love the way you just leave it there
I move in just a little closer
Think I'll take that dare
You're the good you're the good
You're the good kinda bad
You're the best shot of trouble I ever had
Got a mile wide wild side a beautiful crazy
Wherever you wanna take me
I'm in for a ride on the dangerous side
I'm ready for the devil in that angel smile
I can see you being the fix I gotta have
'Cause girl you're the good kinda bad
You're a little lemonade and a lotta Jack Daniels
I want all I can handle
You're the good you're the good
You're the good kinda bad
You're the best shot of trouble I ever had
Got a mile wide wild side a beautiful crazy
Wherever you wanna take me
I'm in for a ride on the dangerous side
I'm ready for the devil in that angel smile
I can see you being the fix I gotta have
'Cause girl you're the good kinda bad
You're the good you're the good kinda bad
You're the good you're the good kinda bad
Wherever you want to take me
The good kind of bad
You're the good you're the good kinda bad
You're the good you're the good kinda bad
I can see you being the fix I gotta have <start> In your dreams
In your dreams a nightingale begins to sing
a twitterpated song.
I appear and then my dear you know at last
your love has come along.
Maybe so but yes or no a while ago
that birdie sang for me
And i just now begin to hope that i'm in your dreams.
This is just the intermezzo
Of that moment that we met
So grand the mem'ry lingers yet
So why let it go
In my dreams a nightingale the one i sent
to sing for you a song
Reappears with glowing ears from words he hears
that you have sent along.
we shall see how that may be
when next we meet again
as we go dreamtodream to be there then
as it were  in your dreams <start> Somewhere along the way we drifted apart
As we walked the road of love we lost our way
Now it's too late to start all over for there's no turning back
We lost each other somewhere along the way
Somewhere along the way we neglected one another
Our careless steps have led us to the end
Oh and all we can do now is just feel sorry for each other
Cause once love has died it won't ever live again
Somewhere along the way hey hey we stumbled oh and we fail
Love is not a game for fools to play
We both played and we both lost now we're both sorry and both to fault
We lost that love somewhere along the way <start> I said the night you left me
Nothin' worse could ever happen
But seeing you with someone else
Proved that I was wrong
And when your eyes met mine
I knew that you were gone forever
Along with all the reasons
I had for hanging on
I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison
Doing time I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him
Together on my mind
I always thought that someday
We might get back together
I just thought you needed time
To spread your wings and fly
But when I saw the lovin' way
You held onto each other
It was all that I could do
Not to break right down and cry
I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison
Doing time I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him
Together on my mind
I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison
Doing time I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him
Together on my mind
I can't lie here with you and him
Together on my mind <start> Satin sheets to lie on
Satin pillows to cry on
Still I'm not happy don't you see
Big long Cadillacs tailor maids upon my back
Still I want you to set me free
I've found another man
Who can give more than you can
Though you've given me everything that money can buy
But your money can't hold me tight
Like he does on a long long night
No you didn't keep me satisfied
Satin sheets to lie on
Satin pillows to cry on
Still I'm not happy don't you see
Big long Cadillacs tailor maids upon my back
Still I want you to set me free
Satin sheets to lie on
Satin pillows to cry on
Still I'm not happy don't you see
Big long Cadillacs tailor maids upon my back
Still I want you to set me free <start> Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring not even a mouse.
All the stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hope that Saint Niccholas soon would be there.
Then what to my wondering eyes should appear
A miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer
A little old driver so lively and quick
I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.
And more rapid than eagles his reindeer all came
As he shouted On Dasher and each reindeers name.
And so up to the housetop the reindeer soon flew
With the sleigh full of toys and Saint Nicholas too.
Down the chimney he came with a leap and a bound
He was dressed allin fur and his belly was round.
He spoke not a word but went straight to his work
And filled all the stocking then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose
Then giving a nod up the chimney he rose.
But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight
Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night <start> I could count the minutes
I could count the days
What's the use in counting
You're gonna go anyway
Always knew you could
Be like the star in a western sky
Look like you're falling
But then just fly on by
Always knew you would
So go with God take care
Keep your head out there
And baby keep your hands on the wheel
Keep your hands on the wheel
I could tell you stories
Of some things I learnt
Sing you the songs
Of bridges I have burnt
And you'd just laugh
You listen
But you never hear a word I say
All along painting pictures in your head
Some different path
So just go with God here's my love to hold
If you ever lose control
And baby keep your hands on the wheel
Keep your hands on the wheel
Keep your hands on the wheel
Just listen to your pretty heart
The road's too dark to see
Might get lost but then you might get free
Might get free
Keep your hands on the wheel
Keep your hands on the wheel
Oh keep your hands on the driver wheel
Keep your hands on the wheel <start> With Jesus I would ever be his matchless name adore.
Hes done so very much for me I want to love him more.
I want to love him more I want to love him more
I want to love him more I do I do I do.
I want to love him more I want to love him more
Hes done so much for me.
He died upon the cruel tree. Our load of guilt He bore.
He suffered shame for you and me. I want to love him more.
Chorus
His children he will not forsake when troubles press them sore.
But in their soul sweet peace awakes I want to love him more.
Chorus
O Prince of life sweet Prince of peace Who dwelt on earth below
My faith in Him will never cease I want to love Him more. <start> Fancy satin pillows that you bought for me to place beneath my head
I must admit they're very nice but I would rather have your arms instead
To have you here beside me and to feel your warmth so very close is what I need
More than all the fancy satin pillows you could ever buy for me
Still I thank you for the fancy satin pillows I don't mean to be unkind
But I can't use 'em both and I thought sharing them was what you had in mind
In the stillness of the night to have your arms reach out and pull me close so tenderly
Means more than all the fancy satin pillows you could ever buy for me
 guitar 
Still I thank you for...
Means more than all the fancy satin pillows you could ever buy for me <start> Forever yours I'll always be please say that you'll give your sweet love to me
Forever yours my love will be I will take care of you say you love me
I started living the day I found you I love you with all my heart say you love me too
I will stay beside you and I will guide you forever yours please say that you're mine
Forever yours I'll always be...
I will take care of you say you love me <start> My last breath I wanna take with a smile
And no regrets no hope of turning back that dial
Let the story I've written be something worth leaving we're leaving behind
When I'm gone tell them I laughed more than I shed tears
When I'm gone tell them I stared down all my fears
That I danced on a wire and I walked through a fire
That I lived every moment 'til that moment retired
So my life goes on goes on when I'm gone
Oh oh
When I'm Gone
Tell him I left that town but it never left my soul
That I settled down but I never got old
If the house was packed and we all raised a glass as the credits rolled
When I'm gone tell them I laughed more than I shed tears
When I'm gone tell them I stared down all my fears
That I danced on a wire and I walked through a fire
That I lived every moment 'til that moment retired
So my life goes on goes on when I'm gone
Time don't last forever
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Time don't last forever
Oh oh oh
When I'm gone 
Did my life go on go on go on
When I'm gone tell them I laughed more than I shed tears
When I'm gone tell them I stared down all my fears
That I danced on a wire and I walked through a fire
That I lived every moment 'til that moment retired
So my life goes on goes on
When I'm gone
When I'm gone
Oh my last breath I wanna take with a smile
Oh oh oh when I'm gone
Oh oh oh when I'm gone
Oh oh oh when I'm gone
Oh oh oh when I'm gone <start> The clock in your pocket keeps tickin'
But that don't get prayed to by me
I threw away all I was given
Just so that I could be free
I've got no future in sight
Time won't deny that I'm right
The past has always been bright
But I've got no future in sight
So if for me you have come alookin'
You better knock with a gun in your hand
For boldness has started a journey
That only the graveyard will end
I've got no future in sight
Time won't deny that I'm right
The past has always been bright
But I've got no future in sight
I made love to my pretty wife this morning
Then I kissed my sleepin' babies goodbye
And have set forth upon those who decided
That this is the day I'd die
And I've got no future in sight
Time won't deny that I'm right
The past has always been bright
But I've got no future in sight <start> I don't think much about her no more
Seldom if ever does she cross my mind
Yesterdays gone it's better forgotten
Like the poison red berries to die on the vine
This morning at dawn Lord I pulled into town
Had some coffee and talked with some old friends of mine
Laughing at the good times they remembered
Then I remembered a time
Lord I can still see the bright lights back in Dallas
As yesterday moves like a dream through my mind
I didn't suppose that I'd ever forget her
And you know it took such a long time
But I don't think much about her no more
Seldom if ever does she cross my mind
Yesterdays gone Lord it's better forgotten
Like the poison red berries that cling to the mind <start> I was born with the Chinook wind howlin in my ears
That Rocky Mountain gusty shit it dried me out for years
Way back I think my grandpa had a rope horse by that name
All I know is God here comes that old west wind again
There's lotsa kinds of problems and there's lotsa kinds of pain
Some will sweat the blazing sun and some rot in the rain
Here we got the Chinook wind a blowin' every day
It's gonna send the good dirt east and leave a terrible migraine
Let her blow let her blow
Whisper me things that I don't know
Let her blow let her blow
Let her blow away illusions like she melts the driftin' snow
There comes a time I stood my ground and said I've had my fill
Of that moisture sucking west wind roarin' in off them hills
Before it flew me crazy I let it carry me away
They told me Son you ain't the first that breeze will
drive a man insane
Let her blow let her blow
Whisper me things that I don't know
Let her blow let her blow
Let her blow away illusions like she melts the winter snow
If you need me you can find me here waitin' on a change
Staring at the distance and askin' what it takes
To make that old Chinook turn back and blow the other way
And maybe if I'm lucky have it blow me home again <start> I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna cross that river
I'm gonna catch tomorrow now
You're gonna wanna hold me
Just like I always told you
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Nobody here will ever find me
But I always be around
Just like the songs I leave behind me
I'm gonna live forever now
You fathers and you mothers
Be good to one another
Please try to raise your children right
Don't let the darkness take 'em
Don't make 'em feel forsaken
Just lead them safely to the light
When this old world has blown asunder
And all the stars from fall this sky
Remember someone really loves you
We'll live forever you and I
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna cross that river
I'm gonna catch tomorrow now
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna cross that river
I'm gonna catch tomorrow now
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna cross that river
I'm gonna catch tomorrow now
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna cross that river
I'm gonna catch tomorrow now
I'm gonna live forever now
I'm gonna live forever now
I'm gonna live forever now
I'm gonna live forever now
Dream of angels and sunshine
Rivers of red wine and orange peel blues
Dream of angels and sunshine
Rivers of red wine and orange peel blues <start> Bring back my peace of mind let me live again
End my long lonely nights make my heart beat again
Drive my grey skies away let the sunshine begin
Bring back my peace of mind and let me live again
I miss your fingertips I miss your loving lips
I miss the tender little things you used to do
I tried so hard to find some other peace of mind
But now I must face the fact there's just one you
Bring back my peace of mind... <start> It wasn't the time it was the color
My mother wore a yellow dress
Carrying my brother
The summer always stung
Bright like metal
The bank was built
With green glass
I felt so forgettable
One look one look
One look and he'll remember
One look one look
One look and he'll remember
It wasn't the time it was the color
Dad in his red Pendleton shirt
Shag carpet brown sofa
The summer always hot
White and still
He asked if I would
Kiss him goodbye
I knew the answer I will
One look one look
One look and he'll remember
One look one look
One look and he'll remember
It wasn't the time it was the color
Tastes far away and feels like gray
I miss the sound I'll miss it forever
The summer always empty
And yellow
He kissed me that day
By the pizza place
I felt so forgettable
One look one look
One look and he'll remember
One look one look
One look and he'll remember <start> Well capitalistic yeast has been sucking the heat
You're passing up you're injured for ability
Well I've been waiting for a compromise but I guess it's more the same
We're separated all the things that we want for gain
You remember your name
Well they were looking right at you you forget the face
If the future's sipping all space and food through a straw
And the monster's finally flipped on it's back
Well the static is a worthy test to help you brush aside the rest
Is this something that you'd ever need
Well I'm okay
Are you scared to take what they've taken from you
Well yeah I'm afraid
We've sold our names...
I'm sick of being accosted by the ghost in the street
Your magazine looking backward thinking junkies are just fodder for the global elite
Do you think you had a choice
When you're eating and sleeping in all the noise
Let the moneymakers keep the politicians afloat
We're biting everything that we're told
Well then a smile and a couple of jokes will be enough to convince the good folks
Well is this something you ever need
Well I'm okay
Are you waiting for a minute to fight for what they've taken from you
Yeah I'm afraid
We've sold our names... <start> At the dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong
You and me at the dark end of the street you and me
I know that time's gonna take its toll
We have to pay for the love we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong
Oh but our love keeps a coming on strong
Steal away to the dark end of the street you and me
They're gonna find us yes they're gonna find us
They're gonna find us oh some day
You and me at the dark end of the street you and me
And when the daylight hours roll around
And by ten we're both downtown
If we shoud meet you just walk right on by
Oh my darling now please don't you cry
Tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street you and me <start> I like your lips like I like my CocaCola yeah
Oh how it pops and fizzes
You like my shirt like I like it when you hold my hand
The way it fits has got me feeling lucky
Lookie who is comin' whoo You got that somethin'
Boy I wanna be where you are and I'm gunnin' for ya'
Can't even fall for some other man 'cause brother man
You know how to get hip to my heart.
C'mon now
All the girls in town look you up and look you down I know
So come on an' pick your kitten
Purr baby purr go ahead and say the word let's go
I think I'm the one you're takin' got me feeling lucky
Lookie who is comin' whoo You got that somethin'
Boy I wanna be where you are and I'm gunnin' for ya'
Can't even fall for some other man 'cause brother man
You know how to get hip to my heart.
Tell me now who Who
Tell me now who Who
You play it cool you play it so coocoocool
And what am I supposed to do when you play it so cool
And I got the hots for you
Lookie who is comin' whoo You got that somethin'
Boy I wanna be where you are and I'm gunnin' for ya'
Can't even fall for some other man 'cause brother man
You know how to get hip to my heart.

I said you know how to get hip to my heart. <start> I think I'll take a boat and sail the ocean and spend my life just roaming on the sea
And kiss the girls from Panama to China then she'll be sorry she mistreated me
I think I'll take a walk and think it over cause things are gettin' tougher for me here
Now that someone else has come between us I think I'll take a walk and disappear
I'll think about the way it makes me jealous to see her walking arm in arm with him
I'll think about the stars up in the heaven and wish that I could be on one of them
I think I'll take a walk just to forget her and walk about a million miles from here
I have a notion to just be a rambler I think I'll take a walk and disappear <start> I only slept for a couple of hours
In the back of my buddies truck
I must be runnin' on solar power
'Cause I'm ready to crank back up
And the boys are all bangin' on cheap guitars
And the girls are all rockin' their bikini tops
And that big boss way up in the sky
My baby says hey I think I wanna get wet
So we hot sand hop it to the water's edge
Hey it's so good to be alive
Swimmin' in sunshine
Swimmin' in sunshine
There's a hole in my beach towel
There's a hole in the atmosphere
We've got the shade of the lifeguard tower
Yeah that's where we keep the beer
And the boys are all bangin' on cheap guitars
And the girls are all rockin' their bikini tops
And that big boss way up in the sky
My baby says hey I think I wanna get wet
So we hot sand hop it to the water's edge
Hey it's so good to be alive
Swimmin' in sunshine
Swimmin' in sunshine
Havin' a good time
Swimmin' in sunshine
Yeah I know Monday always comes again
So I just wanna soak it in
And the boys are all bangin' on cheap guitars
And the girls are all rockin' their bikini tops
And that big boss way up in the sky
My baby's into lockin' in a copper tone tan
So I'm slow motion lotion in with both of my hands
Hey it's so good to be alive
Swimmin' in sunshine
Swimmin' in sunshine
Havin' a good time
Swimmin' in sunshine

Shady Grove my little love
Shady Grove I say
Shady Grove my little love
I'm bound to go away
Cheeks as red a a blooming rose
And eyes are the prettiest brown
She's the darling of my heart
Sweetest girl in towm


I wish I had a big fine horse
And corn to feed him on
And Shady Grove to stay at home
And feed him while I'm gone


Went to see my Shady Grove
She was standing in the door
Her shoes and stockin's in her hand
And her little bare feet on the floor


When I was a little boy
I wanted a Barlow knife
And now I want little Shady Grove
To say she'll be my wife


A kiss form pretty little Shady Grove
Is sweet as brandy wine
And ther ain't no girl in this old world
That's's prettier than mine
 <start> Give me a little of your love love
A little of your love love will see me through
Pour me a little of your wine love
Cause I will be given mine love to you
Don't need money
Just enough to pay my way
Life is sunny with you beside me everyday
Give me a little of your love love
A little of your love love is all I need
Each day I'm looking for a sign love
To tell me you are mine love to stay
My envision
My life's totaling
Is keeping my position with you and love sick game
So give me a little of your love love
A little of your love love is everything
With out true love
Life can be a rocky ride
When I'm with you love
See me glide
Music... <start> I love sleeping in on Saturdays
And I love college football games
I love not acting my age
And good barbecue
Yeah I'm a fan of Faulkner books
And anything my mama cooks
Small mouth bass have got me hooked
On Sunday afternoon
Yes I love good cold beer
And mustard on my fries
I love a good loud honky tonk
That rocks on Friday night
And hell yes I love my truck
But I want you to know
Honey I love your love the most
Man I love how Redman tastes
And damn I love my Nascar race
Any song sung by George Strait
Is country at it's best
Yes I love good cold beer
And mustard on my fries
I love a good loud honky tonk
That rocks on Friday nights
And hell yes I love my truck
But I want you to know
Honey I love your love the most
I love
Yeah I love scuffed up cowboy boots
And broken tore up jeans
A four wheel drive eight point bucks
And rocky road ice cream
And hell yes I love my dog
And Jack D in my coke
But honey I love your love
Yeah I love your love
I love your love the most
I love your love the most <start> To hunting ground from city
That's where my baby took me with her smile
To hunting ground from city
I never thought that I'd have to trace those miles
It's been a while since I've seen that smile
Appear upon her face
And now I find I'm slowly drifting back
From hunting ground to city
To hunting ground from city
Our daughters eyes they took us for a ride
To hunting ground from city
Cat's eyes sparkling blue eyes in my mind
We said goodbye under a drop of sky
We left her in that place
And now we find we're slowly drifting back
From hunting ground to city
From hunting ground from city
The journey down is sure to be a laugh
From hunting ground from city
At least we'll have each other to see it pass
I've seen that line of broken minds
And I fear to join it's ranks
But still I find I'm slowly drifting back
From hunting ground to city
But still I find I'm slowly drifting back
From hunting ground to city <start> It's been that way since the git go
It's been that way since the git go
It's been that way since the git go
Lord it's always been that way
Woman shined the apple and the man had to take a bite
Anything that good God knows just had to be right
Well they woke up naked with a bit headache
He been done in by a slippery snake
a man and a woman get to live a while and then they die
It's been that way since the git go
It's been that way since the git go
It's been that way since the git go
Lord it's always been that way
Politicians make promises that they can't keep
They keep printin' money 'till they get in way too deep
It's the same old lesson they never learn
They're too busy workin' on their next term
Politicians keep makin' fools out of you and me
It's been that way since the git go
It's been that way since the git go
It's been that way since the git go
Lord it's always been that way
Money breeds war as long as there's a man alive
Rich kids go to college and the poor kids fight
Highrollers crap out ev'ry time roll a soldier's bones like loaded dice
War is the beast that makes ev'ry mother cry
It's been that way since the git go
It's been that way since the git go
It's been that way since the git go
Lord it's always been that way
He told the truth and they hung him up to die
The son of God who created you and I
He said it in the Good Book and letters in red
But we keep on forgettin' ev'ry thing He said
Jesus Christ hung on the cross for you and I

Well I never did crawl and I never did toe the line
No man is a master to me I ain't that kind
I just put on my travelin' shoes
If you wanna win you just can't lose the time
Or stay behind
Well I was born to run
To get ahead of the rest
And all that I wanted was to be the best
Just to feel free and be someone
I was born to be fast I was born to run
Well I take the chances for the time I made mistakes
But you don't get nothin' unless you take the breaks
Livin' as dangerous as dynamite
Sure it makes you feel nervous but it makes you feel
alright
Makes you feel alright <start> We are not in a position to display these lyrics due to licensing restrictions. Sorry for the inconvinience. <start> Well I wish that I was on old Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Cause there ain't no smog no smoke on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bill
Now but once I had me a man on Rocky Top
Half bear the other half cat
Well he was wild as a mink but he was sweet as sodapop
I often think about that
Oh Rocky Top you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top Tennessee Rocky Top Tennessee
Now once two strangers climbed ol' Rocky Top
Lookin' for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top
And some say they never will
Did you know corn don't grow at all on Rocky Top
The dirt's too rocky by far
And that's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar
Oh Rocky Top you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top Tennessee Rocky Top Tennessee
Now I've had years of cramped up city life
Trapped luck a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a dadburn pity
Life can't be simple again
Oh Rocky Top you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top

Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
I'll be good to him
I'll bring love to him
Everyone says there'll come a day
When I'll walk alongside of him
Yes just to know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
Why can't he see
How blind can he be
Someday he will see
That he was meant for me ooh
To know know know him

Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile

He's a go getter go getter
When his wife gets off from work he'll go get her
Now I've got a neighbor that lives down the road a ways
His wife holds down a steady job he don't turn his hand all day
I know that most of you will know the kind I'm talkin' about
The kind that rather than have to work he'd rather do without
But he's a go getter a go getter
When his wife gets off from work he'll go get her
There's a group of men in the court house yard any time that you go by
Playin' checkers and tradin' odds and makin' jokes about their wives
They wait all week for pay day and they hold the money's plenty
And the wife that's worked those long hard hours never gets a penny <start> Same old man sitting at the mill
The mill turns around of its own free will
Hand in the hopper and the other in the sack
Ladies step forward and the gents fall back
Down sat an owl and he said all quiet
Lonesome day and a lonesome night
Thought I heard a pretty girl say
Court all night and you sleep next day
Well then said the raven as she flew
If I was a young one I'd get two
One for to fetch and the other to sew
I'd have a string for my bow bow bow
My old man's in Kalamazoo
He don't give no yes I do
First to the left and then to the right
This old mill grinds day and night <start> Just walked down the street to the coffee shop
Had to take a break
I'd been by her side for eighteen hours straight
Saw a flower growin' in the middle of the sidewalk
Pushin' up through the concrete
Like it was planted right there for me to see
The flashin' lights the honkin' horns
All seemed to fade away
In the shadow of that hospital at 
I saw God today
I've been to church I've read the Book
I know He's here but I don't look
Near as often as I should
Yea I know I should
His fingerprints are everywhere
I just slowed down to stop and stare
Opened my eyes and man I swear
I saw God today
Saw a couple walking by they were holding hands
Man she had that glow
Yea I couldn't help but notice she was starting to show
Stood there for a minute taking in the sky
Lost in that sunset
A splash of amber melted into shades of red
I've been to church I've read the Book
I know He's here but I don't look
Near as often as I should
Yea I know I should
His fingerprints are everywhere
I just slowed down to stop and stare
Opened my eyes and man I swear
I saw God today
Got my face pressed up against the nursery glass
She's sleeping like a rock
My name on her wrist wearing tiny pink socks
She's got my nose she's got her mama's eyes
My brand new baby girl
She's a miracle
I saw God today <start> Salve Regina coelitum O Maria

And I aint doin that well
I was gonna do a whole lot better this time
That's what I told myself
And I'm waiting for the lights to change
These days they never do
And all the girls on Rebecca street
Look by you
I saw Katie Kinkade
She said to say hello
And she said she was sorry
When I told her the story
She said that she didn't know
Funny how she's wearing her hair these days
The same way you used to
And all the girls on Rebecca street
Look like you
And every magazine
And every mezzanine
Is starin right back at me
And everywhere I go
Everybody that I know
Every picture on TV
And the light used to turn from red to green
But these days they just turn blue
And all of the girls on Rebecca street
Look like you
And all of the girls on Rebecca street
Look like you <start> After the war was over I was coming home to you
I saw a rainbow at midnight out on the ocean blue
The stars in heaven were shining the moon gave its light from above
I saw your face in this rainbow and it made me think of our love
We'll build our home in the country and make all our dreams come true
There we will make a heaven sweetheart just for we two
Steel
Here we will live so happy and have a baby or two
We'll name them after the rainbow because it reminds me of you
After this life is over and our journey here is through
We'll move to the land of the rainbow and live in the stary blue <start> ou don't need me anymore you're not a girl out in the cold
Searching for someone to care reaching for a hand to hold
Someone to turn to until your heart was well again
But that was all my love was for you don't need me anymore
I'll go on loving you till the day that I die
But I was only meant to teach the broken wings to fly
Till you found somebody who means much more to you than me
Then the tenderness we knew will be just a memory <start> Judy I feel weary now older than a man of thirtythree
The gates of hell just opened after twenty years the warden says I'm free
Revenge was all I wanted when I killed the man that took your life that day
I've had my satisfaction but the price was more than love should have to pay
Lords knows you weren't no lady and the witnesses all swore you was to blame
And the way you teased the menfolk
The jury all agreed you knew no shame knew no shame
Well I'm glad that you can't see me now
You'd probably say that I do not look my best
Those lawyers took my money that Louisiana road gang took the rest
And Judy I can't even conjure up your picture in my mind today
Lately I've been thinkin' what a fool I was to love you anyway
Lords knows you weren't no lady and the witnesses all swore you was to blame
And the way you teased the menfolk the jury all agreed you knew no shame
Well it all seems kinda useless as I place these flowers on your grave today
I don't know what I'm doin' here I've forgotten all the things I came to say <start> Way back on the radio dial
The fire got lit inside a brighteyed child
Every note just wrapped around his soul
From steel guitars to Memphis all the way to rock and roll
Oh I can hear em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol guitar
Oh I can hear em singin'
Keep on dreamin' even if it breaks your heart
Downtown is where I used to wander
Old enough to get there but too young to get inside
So I would stand out on the sidewalk
Listen to the music playin' every Friday night
Oh I can hear em playin'
I can hear the ringin of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh I can hear em singin
Keep on dreamin' even if it breaks your heart
Some dreams stay with you forever
Drag you around but bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on gettin' better
Gotta keep believin' if you wanna know for sure
Oh I can hear em playin'
I can hear the ringin of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh I can hear em singin'
Keep on dreamin' even if it breaks your heart
Oh I can hear em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh I can hear em singin'
Keep on dreamin even if it breaks your heart
Keep on dreamin even if it breaks your heart
Oh oh oh oh oh oh keep on dreamin' oh oh oh
oh oh oh don't let it break your heart <start> I got a shadow and it follows me around
Wherever I go it moves without a sound
My odds are evil that hunts me down and gets me
Finds a way to trick me
Then drowns me in the whiskey
Hold up I need some help
The more you feed the beast the more he raises hell
I know I got a problem
But you know what they say
Smoke 'em if you got 'em
Feeling good
Probably better than I should
It's gone far
I'm standing up here dancing on the wire
There's no denying
He came uninvited
And I kinda like him the most
Find me a preacher I'm down on my knees
I need a leader to break these chains off of me
Don't let 'em hurt me I'm getting kind of worried
Vision's getting blurry please somebody hurry
Feeling good
Probably better than I should
It's gone far
I'm standing up here dancing on the wire
There's no denying
We came uninvited
And I kinda like him the most
Pretty little angel whisper in my ear
Please just make him disappear
I don't know if I can take no more
Feeling good
Probably better than I should
It's gone far
I'm standing up here dancing on the wire
There's no denying
We came uninvited
And I kinda like him the most
Gotta wait for that sun to go down
He's following me around
It gets worse at night
Alright let me have a drink <start> Pinch me I must be dreaming waking up with you and feeling
The tender touch of your good morning kiss
No where else on earth is better than being next to you
Next to heaven it doesnt get any better than this

Next to heaven lies my fate my best friend and my sole mate
God knows this kind of love only comes from up above
Youre the answer to my prayers nothing else compare
Im next to heaven when I am next to you
You look just like an angel tangled in white satin sheets
Lying there with your hair all in a mess
I swear you look your best all dressed up next to nothing
Next to heaven it doesnt get any better than this
Chorus  <start> WHEN YOURE TEN
YOU DONT SEE THE WORLD
AND ALL ITS FURY RAGING
HEAVEN TO YOU
ARE YOUR FRIENDS DOWN THE STREET
MOM CAN I GO THEYRE WAITING
SO YOU RIDE LIKE THE WIND
TO THE EDGE OF THAT TOWN
WHERE THE TREES BEGIN
AND THE FIELDS ROLL OUT
LIKE A MAGIC CARPET
WHERE DREAMS ARE BORN
FREINDSHIPS MADE OATHS ARE SWORN
COWBOYS AND INDIANS
HEROES IN THE SUN
CHASING THOSE SUMMER DAYS
AS FAST AS WE COULD RUN
THE WORLD SEEMED GOLDEN
LIFE HAD JUST BEGUN
WE WERE COWBOYS AND INDIANS
HEROES IN THE SUN
NOW YOURE GROWN
AND EVERYTHINGS CHANGED
ITS ALL ABOUT THE DEAL
YOU REALIZE THAT LIFES STILL A GAME
BUT PEOPLE GET HURT FOR REAL
SO YOU LIVE BY THE BELL SLEEP ON THE NUMBERS
WORK LIKE HELL OR YOU MIGHT GO UNDER
WHEN YOU LAY DOWN YOUR HEAD
ON YOUR PILLOW AT NIGHT
WHAT DO YOU SEE WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES
COWBOYS AND INDIANS
HEROES IN THE SUN
CHASING THOSE SUMMER DAYS
AS FAST AS WE COULD RUN
THE WORLD SEEMED GOLDEN
LIFE HAD JUST BEGUN
WE WERE COWBOYS AND INDIANS
HEROES IN THE SUN
SOLO
COWBOYS AND INDIANS
HEROES IN THE SUN
CHASING THOSE SUMMER DAYS
AS FAST AS WE COULD RUN

HEROES IN THE SUN <start> A corporation owns the factory I work in
Someone else owns the house we call our home
The bank owns the car we drive around
And we've got something we can call our own
We've got love happiness surrounds us
And we thank the Lord for every single day
And with love we'll always have each other
And together we can laugh the years away
 steel 
We're so thankful for our lovely children
And I work hard to keep new shoes upon their feet
But sometimes they've not too much on our table
But we've got something that's mighty hard to feed
We've got love happiness surrounds us...
We've got love happiness surrounds us... <start> My lonely heart was waitin'
You came right on time
You soon had me believin'
True love was on your mind
You took me straight to heaven
I thought we had it made
But baby heaven was just a stop along the way
Chorus
There's a long train rollin'
And a blue moon above
You switched me back I jumped the track
On that railroad of love
You engineered my sadness
You treated me so cruel
Now I'm just another rider
On your long train of fools
Things kept movin' faster
We had love to burn
Thought we were on the same track
But you took a different turn
And now that it's all over
I ask myself sometimes
How many others have you taken down that line <start> Last night my tears they were fallin'
I went to bed so sad and blue
Then I had a dream of you
I dreamed I was strollin' in the evenin'
Underneath the harvest moon
I was thinkin' about you
And then you met me in the moonlight
The stars were shining in your eyes
But another was there too
I don't believe you've met my baby
You looked at her you looked at me
I wondered who you were talkin' to
I shook the hand of your stranger
But I was shaking more inside
'Cause I was still wonderin' who
Your arm was restin' on her shoulder
You smiled at her she smiled at you
Her eyes were filled with victory
She said my brother wants to marry
And then my heart was filled with ease
I knew that you would marry me
Oh I don't believe you've met my baby
You looked at her you looked at me
I knew that you would marry me
I don't believe you've met my baby <start>    
Left my man this morning
Standing in the door
When I got back
I said I don't want you no more
Goodbye goodbye daddy goodbye
He always tells
I ain't treatin' her right
Her man going out from you
Stayin' out all day all night
I said goodbye daddy goodbye
That man wrote me a letter
Said momma please come home
When I got home last night
Found my man had gone
Goodbye goodbye daddy goodbye
Ain't got no body to tell my trouble to
Lay down in my bed tryin' to hold out without you
Goodbye goodbye daddy goodbye
Oh goodbye daddy
Daddy please tell me goodbye
If ever you goin' want me daddy
Momma surely lay down and die
Goodbye goodbye daddy goodbye <start> You close the door in front of me I wait patiently outside
And as the minutes tick away I feel my anger rise
And who's the object of my rage and who's not being fair
Is it you for your indifference or me for just standing there
'Cause in my mind the room beyond is bathed in golden light
I dream about you through the day and I toss and turn at night
Sometimes it's hard to understand when they say that pride's a sin
Should I go or should I stay on the outside looking in
Well I didn't make the grade today and I'm not the only one
But my heart it won't stop hurting and feeling all alone
Maybe we'll trade places in some not so distant year
I'll hear your voice calling out and I'll cover up my ears
'Cause in my mind the room beyond is bathed in golden light
I dream about you through the day and I toss and turn at night
Sometimes it's hard to understand when they say that pride's a sin
Should I go or should I stay on the outside looking in <start> I had it all lined up
Then my future crashed
I heard the deadbolt lock
And there stood my past
But there are no signs for tomorrow
On the back roads of my sorrow
I could beg steal
I could borrow
But the grace will have to come to me
Chorus
I'm gonna shake my soul
And release my hold
Givin' up control
And let the rest unfold
Cause it's a long long way from here to where we go
Take off the training wheels
Lift off the handle bars
I'll drive right through my fears
And resurrect my heart
And even in my darkest hour
When my tears staye undercover
I know it one way or another
Love is coming back around to me
Chorus
In the face that I wore as a child
I can see myself
Every day of my life I'm tring just to free myself
To be myself
And the rain comes I can hear it
Like a bass drum loud and clear it's
Ancient wisdom of the spirit
Ali Ali all come free
Chorus
It's a long long way from here to where we go <start> I've seen ladies look at me
With want to in their eyes
But each time they do
I think of you and it makes me realize
Just any old love won't do
No any old love won't do
I don't want to love
If it isn't with you
Just any old love won't do
You've got the only arms
I've ever come runnin' to
Love has always led me to your bed
Just any old love won't do
No Any old love won't do
Just any old love won't do
I don't want to love
If it isn't with you
Just any old love won't do
Just any old love won't do
No any old love won't do
I don't want to love
If it isn't with you
Just any old love won't do
No any old love won't do
Just any old love won't do
I don't want to love
If it isn't with you
Just any old love won't do
No any old love won't do
Just any old love won't do
I don't want to love
If it isn't with you
Just any old love won't do. <start> Feliz Navidad

Well it's Saturday night
You're all dressed up and blue
I've been watchin' you go out
Maybe you been watchin' me too
So somebody ran out
Left somebody's heart in a mess
Well if you're lookin' for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest
Some girls they want a handsome Dan
Or some goodlookin' Joe
On their arms some girls want
A sweet talkin' Romeo
We'll 'round here baby
I've learned you get what you can get
So if you're rough enough for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest
Yeah the road is dark
And it's a thin thin line
But I want you to know
I'll walk it for you anytime
Maybe your other girlfriends
Couldn't pass the test
Well if you're rough and ready for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest <start> Tonight it's so cold the rain is fallin' but it's still not as cold as your love for me
That's why I'm walking down this highway and a diesel going my way
Will take me far from you and you'll be free
There was nothin' left but leavin' for us in Tulsa
But then again the same was throughout in LA
Seems like trouble always finds us so I broke the tie that binds us
There was nothin' left but leavin' anyway
 fiddle 
We tried to find our dreams in New Mexico
But the answers just weren't there in Santa Fe
And we could blame it all on Texas but the problem now we fuss is
We never had what we thought anyway
There was nothin' left but leavin' any longer
And I finally found the strenght to walk away
Tell the kids their daddy loves them they'll understand I'm thinkin' of them
There was nothin' left but leavin' anyway there was nothin' left but leavin' anyway <start> Well tonight she came home early
And she watched TV alone
Lately the nightlife doesn't do much for her
It's not that she's not pretty
She could have brought some cowboy home
But the last time that she did it only bored her
Well she's tired of crowded places
Singles bars and strangers faces
And she knows there's something missing in her life
It's time for love she's had enough romance
It's time for love she's tired of onenight stands
Anyone can see she's waited long enough
It's time for love she's had her moonlight nights
It's time for love she's tired of neon lights
She's had everything else but now it's time for love
So she sits down at her mirror
And she brushes out her hair
She thinks about the men that she's let hold her
There were some that took her dancing
There were some that took her home
But noone ever took the time to know her
And as the tears start falling
There's a voice inside her calling
And she knows there must be something more than this.
It's time for love she's had enough romance
It's time for love she's tired of onenight stands
Anyone can see she's waited long enough
It's time for love she's had her moonlight nights
It's time for love she's tired of neon lights
She's had everything else but now it's time for love <start> I'm not tryin' to start anything
By comin' up to you tonight
I know that he's yours now
It's sinkin' in with time
But tonight I've had to much to drink
And he stays on my mind
I just wanted to say he's the best thing you'll ever find
'Cause he ain't your regular Joe ya know
And I'm the crazy fool who let him go
And if he says he loves you
Then that's what he means
He's the best man I've ever seen
I just wanted you to know
He ain't your regular Joe
She turned to me sharply
And said you think I don't know that
I can't believe you even spoke to me
What nerve you must have
I said no you don't understand
You don't wanna be in my shoes
It took him leavin' me
Before I ever knew
That he ain't your regular joe you know
And I'm the crazy fool that let him go
And if he says he loves you then that's what he means
He's the best man I've ever seen
I just wanted you to know he ain't your regular Joe
So she drove home from that bar
To say that She was sorry to him
She was wrong to have stormed out to go
Somewhere she shouldn't have been
He said hey baby that's okay
Everybody has their days
That's when she turned to him to say
You ain't your regular Joe
You know
And I don't ever plan to let you go
Cause when I say I love you
Then that's what I mean
You're the best man I've ever seen
Oh baby I love you so
You ain't your regular Joe <start> There's a scar on my right elbow
From a barbed wire fence when I was eight years old
I must have ran a mile just crying in my torn shirt
'Till I heard the words tell me where it hurts.
If there was a scratch or a bruise on my skin
Mama would put me back together again
All it took was her prayers and her kisses
It would heel me just like stitches.
I took Sherry Johnson to the high school dance
But she left early with my best friend
I must of drove ten miles to get my mind off her
But it didn't work 'till I heard the words tell me where it hurts
She could mend a broken heart fix a bicycle wreck
Funny now but back then it seemed life or death
I've seen her sew rags into riches
It would heel me just like stitches. <start> I've been a rolling stone all my life
Flying all alone flying blind
I've seen it all I've been around
I've been lost and I've been found
But who I am with you is who I really wanna be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you it feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah a better man is who I am with you
I've got a ways to go on this ride
But I got a hand to hold that fits just right
You make me laugh you make me high
You make me wanna hold on tight
'Cause who I am with you is who I really wanna be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you it feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah a better man is who I am with you
Who I am with you
Because of you I'm a lucky man
You're the best part of who I am
Who I am with you is who I really wanna be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you it feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah a better man is who I am with you
Yes who I am with you <start> You are a gnarled pear tree
Near an Oak that binds your bitter roots.
Beneath its living branches
Fingers bend and ache with rotting fruit.
And I am sorry sorry sorry for my shade.
Uprooted to protect you.
Sorry sorry sorry for my shade.
What a stick figure I have made.
You are a bitter brother in the shadow of a twin.
Strangled in a warm embrace.
You have grown up savage mean and thin.
And I am sorry sorry sorry for my arms.
I tried to protect you.
Sorry sorry sorry for my arms.
I have darkened all of your charms.
You are a jackolantern
Who woke up on a bitter winter morn.
Your skin soft and sallow.
Your short season has now come and gone.
I am sorry sorry sorry the time.
Your ruined face some reflection of love.
Sorry sorry sorry for the time. <start> I held onto the hurt
Wrestled to the ground
I fought it like heaven and hell
And I lost every round
There wasn't anybody I would trust
't was so long since I'd felt love
I'd forgotten what it was
Baby 'til you
Got ahold of my angry heart
I saw the truth
When you led my way out of the dark
I was draggin' around these chains
Like some ghost in the hall
Swearin' out the pain
And empty from it all
Until you got ahold of my angry heart
Living in the past
Locked up with my rage
Well I built that prison myself
And it's such a lonely cage
I started believing I would never heal
But your love changed my life when I thought my fate was sealed
Baby 'til you
Got ahold of my angry heart
I saw the truth
When you led my way out of the dark
I was draggin' around these chains
Like some ghost in the hall
Swearin' out the pain
And empty from it all
Until you got ahold of my angry heart
I thought I would disappear without a trace
Until your love washed each teardrop from my face
Baby 'til you
Got ahold of my angry heart
I saw the truth
When you led my way out of the dark
I was draggin' around these chains
Like some ghost in the hall
Swearin' out the pain
And empty from it all
Until you got ahold of my angry heart
Baby you've got ahold of my heart <start> 
Nobody saw them running
From th Avenue
They never found the fingerprints
Or the weapon that was used
But someone killed country music
Cut out its heart and soul
They got away with murder
Down on music row
The almight dollar
And the lust for worldwide fame
Slowly killed tradition
And for that someone shouldhang 
They all say Not Guilty
But the evidence will show
That murder was committed
Down on music row
For the steel guitars no longer cry
And the fiddles barely play
But drums and rock 'n' roll guitars
Are mixed up in your face
Ol' Hank wouldn't have a chance
On today's radio
Since they committed murder
Down on music row
They thought no one would miss it
Once it was dead and gone
They said no one would buy them ol'
Drinkin' and cheatin' songs 
Well there ain't no justice in it
And the hard facts are cold
Murder's been committed
Down on music row
For the steel guitars no longer cry
And you can't hear fiddles play
With drums and rock 'n' roll guitars
Mixed right up in your face
Why the Hag wouldn't have a chance
On today's radio
Since they committed murder
Down on music row
Why they even tell the Possum
To pack up and go back home
There's been an awful murder
Down on music row <start> She's a rose where roses never grow
Behind the swinging doors she pours the wine that flows
She keeps on pretending that she's having fun
But it's a blue blue rose that grows beneath the neon sun
She's my sunshine lady maybe just a little bit shady
Someday I'll take her where real flowers grow
But until then she'll be my precious lovin' neon rose
The world is full of roses that bloom in the spring
But to me there's just one rose that means anything
I guess it's no secret what everybody knows
Just how much I love you my precious lovin' neon rose
She's a rose where roses...
But until then she'll be my precious lovin' neon rose <start> Seasons come and seasons go
One day sun the next day snow
Flowers die and flowers grow
But love is neverending
Bridge
You can't kill it with goodbye
It always finds a place to hide
Inside your heart for your whole life
Love is neverending
Chorus
When the lights have all gone down
It'll still be hangin' 'round
Even when you think it's lost it can still be found
When every memory has been made
And the pages start to fade
And every prayer you ever prayed is heaven bound
When you think the ride is over
You're back at the beginning
Ohlove is neverending
When a man and a woman start growin' old
The fire of passion may grow cold
But what they got still warms their soul
Love is neverending
Chorus
It keeps goin' on and on
Long after we're all gone away
Bridge
Time may change what you believe
But one day the truth will set you free
Just have faith and you will see
Love is neverending
Bridge
Love is neverending <start> Down in the Willow garden
Where me and my love did meet
As we sat acourtin'
My love fell off to sleep
I had a bottle of Burgundy wine
My love she did not know
So I poisoned that dear little girl
On the banks below
I drew a sabre through her
It was a bloody knife
I threw her in the river
Which was a dreadful sign
My father often told me
That money would set me free
If I would murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connolly
My father sits at his cabin door
Wiping his teardimmed eyes
For his only son soon shall walk
To yonder scaffold high
My race is run beneath the sun
The scaffold now waits for me
For I did murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connelly <start> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the fiveandten it's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes that glow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
I can feel it in the air
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's right within your heart mmm mmm mmm yeah <start> Soft as the voice of an angel breathing a lesson unheard
Hope with a gentle persuasion whispers her comforting word
Wait till the darkness is over wait till the tempest is gone
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow after the shower is gone
Whispering hope oh how welcome thy voice
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice
Whispering hope oh how welcome thy voice
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice <start> Verse 
I'm in the way the bright and shining way I'm in the gloryland way
Telling the world that Jesus saves today Yes I'm in the gloryland way.
I'm in the glory land way I'm in the gloryland way.
Chorus
I'm in the gloryland way I'm in the gloryland way
Heaven is nearer and the way growth clearer
For I'm in the gloryland way.
Chorus 
List to the call the gospel call today Get in the gloryland way
Wanderers come home O hasten to obey
And get in the gloryland way.
Verse 
Onward I go rejoicing in His love I'm in the gloryland way
Soon I shall see Him in that home above
O I'm in the gloryland way. <start> Loving me to you seems such a bother you made it easy for me to love another
So don't blame her for stealing me you let her
And where your love stopped she went a little bit father
You changed so much I was more at ease with a stranger
It wasn't so hard our love was already danger
She does everything that pleases me you never
And where your love stopped she went a little bit father
She went a little bit farther to make me feel love
She considered my feelings now she's all that I'm thinking of
So don't blame her for stealing me you let her
And where your love stopped she went a little bit father
 guitar  steel 
She went a little bit farther... <start> 
I'm going home to the arms of my hometown sweetheart
Cause she means the world to me
I have missed her cherry lips cherry smile missed her kiss all the while
Been as lonesome as can be
No other girl incompare to my hometown sweetheart
Hand to toe she suits me fine
I'm just a hometown boy who'll be full of joy when I'll see
That hometown sweetheart of mine

Cause she means the world to me

Been as lonesome as can be <start> It's her prerogative to be extra sensitive
When her heart is backed up against a wall
She can justify every single reason why
She answers to the desperate call
Her careless spirit makes her fearless
She' walked fire for you
A woman will do 
Just about anything
God forgive her 
If she goes a little crazy
But you can't blame her
For what's not a choice anymore
Her emotions take control
No telling just how far she'll go
A woman will do 
Just about anything
Her reckless tenderness
Will often get her in a mess
It's not so easy to clean up
It's a necessity she'll fire relentlessly for love
She's not perfect but it's worth it
To thine own heart be true
A woman will do 
Just about anything
God forgive her 
If she goes a little crazy
But you can't blame her
For what's not a choice anymore
Her emotions take control
No telling just how far she'll go
A woman will do 
Just about anything <start> I could give you pretty clothes show you off downtown
Make you so happy all the time
And I could be so proud of you brag about the things you do
But I couldn't love you more if you were mine
Oh I know he mistreats you and there's no love left for him
Still he holds you to the vows you made one time
I'd walk through the flame for you do anything you ask me to
But I couldn't love you more if you were mine
No I couldn't love you more if you were mine
For I miss you when I leave and my anger starts to climb
Yes I hate this life we're living so let's lay it on the line
Cause I couldn't love you more if you were mine
 steel 
No I couldn't love you more if you were mine...
No I couldn't love you more if you were mine <start> Lonely tears roll down
As midnight comes around
But i can make it trough
In sweet dreams of you
In the shadow of the night
I still hold you tight
Did it all comes true
In sweet dreams of you
In sweet dreams i see
The way thing you to be
When your love was thide
And your heart was true
In sweet dreams of you
Oh i call out your made
And you come to me again
The way you used to do
In sweet dreams of you
In sweet dreams of you
In sweet dreams of you <start> I'm country
Well there's a little word and it fits me to a t
I don't know how you spell it but its country and that's me.
I laugh when I'm happy and cry when I'm blue
'cus when I'm mad like I'm suppose to do
On a Saturday night I'll have a drink or two
And hollow at the moon I'm country.
I chew tobaccer and spit it on the ground
Talk to the cows when no one ain't around
I'm trapped on the mountain when the snows falling down
Yes sir boys I'm country
Chorus
I'm as country as bronc on the western plains
Just as wild and twice as hard to tame
As high on living as a noon day sun yea
I'll be country 'til the day I'm done.
City folks think I'm crude I guess
You can tell I'm a hick by the way I dress
But that don't matter I'm as happy as can be
And proud as heck that I'm country.
Well there's nothing wrong with city if you like it that's fine
Drivin' them freeways wasting its time
But I bet you folks in the back of your mind kinda wish you was country don't
Chorus
Come on boys keep singing them country songs who knows maybe we will just
Convert some of these city folks into country folks and they'll all move out to
The country and then the country won't be country anymore. hold on
I just gave you one side to the whole picture because
Country is heart and dust and snow where the winters get down to forty below
And the works is hard
And the pay sure low and it ain't all roses being country.
Hang in there folks don't do nothin' foolish now
You got yourself a nice high paying job air conditioned offices
Yea you got movie theaters right on down the street there
You got yourself a city park too now that's country
And there you don't have to worry about no rattle snakes biting on your leg
Or no abdominal snowman coming down and tearing off your head or nothing like
That there <start> I never want this night to end
Sitting here hanging out with all of my friends
Telling stories too many secrets for one man to hold
Catching up on our lives out on the road
I came in on a red eye from Austin
Jackie rode his bus in straight from Los Angeles
Brady said they got busted and it really cost them
They'll probably never go back to Charleston again
Singing come on singing come on through that old red door
You know they've seen the likes of us coming in here before
Laughing singing whiskey drinking drifting troubadours
Living like it's always Friday night behind that old red door
Bobby just found out that Shelly left him
She said she couldn't stand how he was never around
He always played his cards before he read them
Well he just laughed it off and brought the whole damn house a round
Singing come singing come on through that old red door
You know they've seen the likes of us coming in here before
Laughing singing whiskey drinking drifting troubadours
Living like it's always Friday night behind that old red door
The sun is starting to peek in through the window
Dominoes are face down just like Charlie is gain
My sides are aching from all the bad jokes
It's the kind of night that you never want to end
Singing come on singing come on through that old red door
You know they've seen the likes of us coming in here before
Laughing singing whiskey drinking drifting troubadours
Living like it's always Friday night behind that old red door
Singing come on singing come come on through that old red door
You know they've seen the likes of us coming in here before
Laughing singing whiskey drinking drifting troubadours
Living like it's always Friday night behind that old red door.
Yeah we're living like its always Friday night behind that old red door <start> Now Little Will was from the hills way back in the sticks
He got his reputation from turning on them country chicks
He drove a souped up hot rod car buddy he could really
Knock those little girls off their feet yeah
Hillbilly Willy
He'd talk that ole sweet lovers talk with a hillbilly drawl
Willy wasn't much for looks he was only five feet tall
But when he talked that ole sweet talk he drove those little girls silly
They stood in line waiting for their time to court
Hillbilly Willy
Then this country cyclops who measured six foot nine
Came up to Little Will and said You stole that little girl of mine
Then there was a awful brawl boy it was a dilly
When the fighting stopped there on top stood
Hillbilly Willy
Now the moral of the story is to be a lover you gotta be tough
Even if you're just five feet tall you gotta be able to strut your stuff
Now to all you lovers in radioland if your love life's a little chilly
Bear in mind the rough tough kind like
Hillbilly Willy
Just bear in mind the rough tough kind like
Hillbilly Willy <start> Front row center in that little white church
I was singing at a baby laying in a manger
Eight years old wearing angel wings
Yeah and to this day
That's what you see
I've been daddy's little girl since my first cry
And it was hard turning eighteen saying goodbye
You told me I was gonna take the world by storm
And mama said you cried all the way home
You think I'm strong you think I'm fearless
Even when I'm I'm at my weakest
You always see the best in me when I can't
I wanna be the girl you think I am
I got my flaws and I've got regrets
And I know there's more on the road ahead
When I wonder if I'll ever measure up
Oh I thank God for a father's love
'Cause you think I'm brave and you think I'm beautiful
You think that I can do the impossible
You always see the best in me when I can't
I wanna be the girl you think I am
Oh whoa
Oh whoa
The girl you think I am yeah
Ooh yeah
All I want more than anything
Is to make you proud of me
'Cause you think I'm strong and you think I'm fearless
Even when I'm I'm at my weakest
You believe in me yeah you're my biggest fan
So I wanna be the girl you think I am
I wanna be the girl you think I am <start> dear penis
i dont think i like you anymore
you used to watch me shave
now all ya do is stare at the floor
oh dear penis

a paper towel and a dirty magazine

and i think that youre the one to blame
dear penis

dear rodney

on our man to hand relationship
come to terms with truly how we feel
if we put our heads together
we'd just stay home forever
dear penis
i think i like you after all.
oh and rodney
while you're shaving shave my balls. <start> I'm looking for that Lonely Street
I've got a sad sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep
Where's this place called Lonely Street
A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Where's this place called Lonely Street
Perhaps upon that Lonely Street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love die
A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Where's this place called Lonely Street <start> It couldn't have been more than  but that Mississippi heat looked good on her
He was never cool with breaking rule but you can't say no to the smile of the summer girl
They were hoppin fences and making wishes that the boys in blue would mind their own business
His Ivy League start fell apart when she stole a kiss and stole his heart
Miss Red White and Blue
What's that boy gonna do with you
A bandit on the lose
Bonnie and Clyde meets American Pie
He said I wanna run with you
But sorry boy there's no room for two
So Miss Red White and blew a big kiss to the camera
Took his heart and his money too
She cut his hair and changed his clothes
The summer girl came to kidnap his soul
They rolled into town took a look around
She said baby lets blow this Popsicle stand down.
When he went in to pay for gas
She hit the road and ain't looking back
Chorus <start> There's a rock and a field and a dirty sky.
I'm still as corpse I'm content as a bride
Thoughts of you and those flyin' shoes
All around me.
One wrong step and it's a long way down
So I triple check the hand holds stand on firmer ground
But it's not so easy when the whole mountains
Coming down on you.
So we wait for the morning when we'll stumble on the truth.
Probably fail to recognize it as we're digging at its roots
The sorrow and the anger that we've sown
In the fields all around us.
Hey little princess hey little pea
Come down from your tower and dance with me.
Yah you're the fairest one in the land.
Try on this glass slipper and give me your hand.
There's a rock and a field and a collapsing sky.
I'm precious as a snowman fragile as a lie
Thoughts of you and those flyin' shoes
All around me.
I'm afraid of the anger of the hard twisted heart
That beats in the chests of those that are caught
In the ruins of the lives of those
All around them.
I'm sick of the blood and I'm sick of the bleeding
The effort it takes just to keep on dreaming
Of better days and better ways
Of living.
Hey little princess hey little pea
Come down from your tower and dance with me.
Yah you're the fairest one in the land.
Try on this glass slipper and give me your hand.
Hey little princess hey little pea
Come down from your tower and dance with me
Yah you're the fairest one in the land.
Try on this glass slipper and give me your hand. <start> He came speeding through the town each day at sundown
And his car was painted candy apple red
He was coming there to see the sheriff's daughter
And the sheriff didn't know it so they said
Time and time again the sheriff tried to catch him
But he always speeded up and got away
That old county jail stood patiently a waiting
And the sheriff vowed he'd put him there some day
Well there goes candy apple red that's what the people said
If he doesn't slow it down a bit he's gonna end up dead
And the sheriff's daughter said she'd rather end up dead
Than to live without her candy apple red
So the sheriff built a barricade to catch him
And he sat there at the limits of the town
But the sheriff's daughter had already net him
And he married him before the sun went down
When the sheriff saw his comin' down the highway
He saw they couldn't stop and quickly caught his breath
As they crashed the barricade the car exploded
And the boy and girl went to a flaming death
Well there goes candy apple red... <start> there were signs of a struggle at the rodeo grounds
there was a body in the bleachers not making no sounds
blood in the grandstand blood on the seats
the county cops called in the mounted police
theres trouble in the country trouble country style
dont blink twice or youll miss it by a country mile
trouble in the country trouble country style
dont think twice or youll miss it by a country mile
we took a bulldogger's money from him playin stook
but he's an oklahoma thug and he didn't want it took
pistol came out so we played some more
lost most of it back to him headed for the door
tried to sell my cows but the border got closed
so we'll tighten up the belt and ride it out i spose
feedin calved out heifers and their young uns too
spending money on hay to feed beef i can't use <start> Please release me let me go
'Cause I don't love you anymore
And to live without love is a sin
So release me and let me love again
I have found a new love dear
And I'll always want him near
His lips are warm while yours are cold
So release me my darlin' let me go
Oh please release me let me go
'Cause I just won't love you anymore
And to live together we both know is a sin
So release me release me and let me love again
Oh please please please please
Release me let me go
'Cause I I don't love you anymore
And to live together is a sin
So release me and let me love again <start> 
I was sittin' alone in a bar yesterday
Just passin' the time when I heard a sweet voice say
How's about one far the road you and I
Then I turned and saw an angel with smokey blue eyes
We talked of the weather and things that we'd done
We've laughed at each heartache like two kids a having fun
I was in heaven I won't try to deny
When I danced with an angel with smokey blue eyes 
The jukebox was playing when I heard my heart sing
For on her third finger I placed my class ring
Well I'm not pretending oh I'll love her till I die
As I turned and kissed the angel with smokey blue eyes
Smokey blue eyes smokey blue eyes I fell so in love with smokey blue eyes <start> Inside her feeble mind
She is spinning out of time
Like a hunter who's gone blind my valentine
Beside her velvet nest
She humiliates the best
Couldn't take no more I guess of my valentine
Valentine I killed my valentine
And I laughed until I cried for my valentine
Valentine I killed my valentine
And I shall proudly do the time for my valentine
Beneath her rugged skirt
She does most of her work
Laughing while you hurt for my valentine
In the middle of every dream
Is a lie that holds the key
To free you from what you think you'd need like my valentine
Valentine I killed my valentine
And I laughed until I cried for my valentine
Valentine I killed my valentine
And I shall proudly do the time for my valentine <start> I've been known to tie one on and honky tonk til half past three
But the party don't get started til my baby pours her love on me
She's a hundred proof lord she's smooth
She makes me moan all night long
So I don't need the booze to get a buzz on
Chorus
I've tried it all from Tennessee whiskey
To Ozark mountain moonshine
But it's her sweet love that packs the punch
And keeps me higher than a Georgia pine
Mr southern comfort don't come in a bottle
I get a double shot of love home grown
So I don't need booze to get a buzz on
My little country girl makes my head whirl and my knees begin to shake
No I can't walk no chalk line I ain't a talking or a thinking straight
I'm hooked on my baby's love there ain't nothing in a jug this strong
And I don't need the booze to get a buzz on
Chorus
I wear a blue ribbon grin every now and then
But I don't need that to get stoned
I don't need the booze to get a buzz on
No I don't need the booze to get a buzz on <start> You walked out so many times and left me with a worried mind
Confused alone no knowing what to do
Then you come back and I'd forgive and heartaches end but mem'ries live
Each time I turn a lighter shade of blue
Cause I don't hurt the way I used to hurt don't cry the way I used to cry
Could be a sign I'm gettin' over you
There'll come a day it won't be long you'll come back and find me gone
Each time I turn a lighter shade of blue each time I turn a lighter shade of blue
 steel 
Cause I don't hurt the way... <start> Late at night a disc jockey plays a sad song by request
For some lonely girl in a one room world whose tears won't let her rest
For she lives every word of the song she just heard
As she clutches her pillow so tight
She's just one of those lonely people in the night
It's three a.m. in New York City but the wino he doesn't know
His bottle is empty his pockets are empty and where did his pals all go
He shared with them and he cared for them
For a while everything was all right
Now he's one of those lonely people in the night
Just look at the lonely people in this world
There's too many women without a man and boys without a girl
If we lonely people could find one another
What a happy world this could be
For there's too many lonely people just like me <start> Well I was lookin' for just a little bit more
Than just another pretty face
Someone who would be strong and true
If trouble ever came my way
Too many times I've been left behind
When my back was up against the wall
But now I found someone who ain't gonna run
No matter how the dice may fall
She's tough enough to stand by me
When it all comes tumblin' down
She's tough enough to steady me
When I'm walkin' on shaky ground
When it comes to tenderness
Buddy that's when she's at her best
When the goin' gets rough she's tough
Well she's soft and sweet and she's good to me
Even when times are bad
She picks me up with a gentle touch
Anytime I'm feelin' sad
Don't you know I'll never let her go
'Cause she makes it so plain to see
When love is real it's strong as steel
And hers is all I'll ever need
She's tough enough to stand by me
When it all comes tumblin' down
She's tough enough to steady me
When I'm walkin' on shaky ground
When it comes to tenderness
Buddy that's when she's at her best
When the goin' gets rough she's tough
And I'm so glad that I'm her man
'Cause when the you know what starts to hit the fan
She's tough enough to stand by me
When it all comes tumblin' down
She's tough enough to steady me
When I'm walkin' on shaky ground
When it comes to tenderness
Buddy that's when she's at her best
When the goin' gets rough
She's tough enough to stand by me
When it all comes tumblin' down
She's tough enough to steady me
When I'm walkin' on shaky ground
When it comes to tenderness
Buddy that's when she's at her best
When the goin' gets rough
She's tough enough to stand by me
When it all comes tumblin' down <start> Chorus
Last night I had the strangest dream
I ever dreamed before
'Cause I dreamed the world
Had all agreed to put an end to war
I dreamed I saw a mighty room
Filled with women and men
And the papers they were signing said
They'd never fight again
And when the papers were all signed
And a million copies made
They all joined hands and they bowed their heads
And grateful prayers were prayed
And the people in the streets below
Were dancing 'round and 'round
And swords and guns and uniforms
Were scattered on the ground <start> Imagine a world where no music was playing
Then think of a church with nobody praying
If you ever looked up at a sky with no blue
Then you've seen a picture of me without you
Have you walked in a garden where nothing was growing
Or stood by a river where nothing was flowing
If you've seen a red rose unkissed by the dew
Then you've seen a picture of me without you
Can you picture Heaven with no angels singing
Or a quiet Sunday morning with no church bells ringing
If you've watched as the heart of a child breaks in two
Then you've seen a picture of me without you <start> I guess we guess are way through life
How many times do we really know for sure
I was just hoping for the best
Then I woke up in these lovin' arms of yours
What I felt was unmistakable
When I fell for you
It was real it was magic
It was calm it was savage
It was cool as a breeze
It was warm to the touch
It was never enough
It was always too much
It did all the things love does
That's how I knew
It was
Who thought that I could laugh so loud
Then turn around and cry so many tears
I used to have so many doubts
But one by one you made them disappear
What I found was unbelievable
But I believe it's true
It was real it was magic
It was calm it was savage
It was cool as a breeze
It was warm to the touch
It was never enough
It was always too much
It did all the things love does
That's how I knew
It was
You asked what I felt when you walked through the door
Was it fear
Was it clear
It was all that and more
It was real it was magic
It was calm it was savage
It was cool as a breeze
It was warm to the touch
It was never enough
It was always too much
It did all the things love does
That's how I knew
It was
That's how I knew
It was <start> Troubles and trials
Often betray us
Tempting the wearing
Body to stray
But we shall all meet
'Side the still waters
With the Good Shepherd
Leading the way
Those who have strayed were
Sought by the Master
He who once gave His
Life for the sheep
Out on the mountain
Now He is searching
Bringing them in
Forever to keep
Going up home to
Live in green pastures
Where we shall live and
Die nevermore
Even the Lord will
Be in that number
When we shall reach that
Heavenly Shore
We will not heed the
Voice of the stranger
For he would lead us
On to despair
Following on with
Jesus our Savior
We shall all reach that
Country so fair <start> Communications are down all over town
People tryin' to get through some will never get an answer
But I've already found the way to get through to you
It comes in gentle and clear I'm still the same romancer
And you know what I'm thinkin' if I have to tell you myself
I can never let you wonder what I want you to believe
And there isn't any wonderin' how lucky I am
From the smile that I'm wearin' and the heart out on my sleeve
Everybody thinks they know me
I don't doubt that it's true
I've never been one to put up any walls
There's so much of me they'll never know
Not the way you do
When it comes to me you know it all
I've seen all of the signs and all the changing of minds
And the signals getting crossed and the killing seeds are planted
But those could never grow out of things that we know
Like the vows that we made we can always take for granted
While everyone else is losing ground you know where I stand
Forsaking everyone but you to reap the love that we sowed
One thing everyone knows is I'm a man of my word
And you and I have places I will never let them go
While everybody thinks they know me
I don't doubt that it's true
I've never been one to put up any walls
There's so much of me they'll never know
Not the way you do
When it comes to me you know it all
My life has been an open book till you walked in
And turned a page I never saw
You found a side of me that even I could never see
When it comes to me you know it all
Still everybody thinks they know me
I don't doubt that it's true
'Cause I'm still not one to put up many walls
There's so much of me they'll never know
Not the way you do
When it comes to me you know it all
When it comes to me you know it all <start> 
Bill Fries says that this is based on a true story from the late 's when a band of hippies rolled into Telluride and decided to stay.
One day about four or five years ago
We is settin' at the Conoco station
Kickin' tires and swattin' flies
And discussin' the State of the Union
When right out in front of the Baptist church
Come a big ol' purple school bus
Had astrological signs upon it
And thirtyfive hippies and dogs inside
About half of 'em went for the courthouse lawn
And them dogs commenced on the fireplug
Rest of 'em set there starin' at us
And I says Roy go get your Flit gun
He says Which is the hippies And which is the dogs
I says Beats the hell outta me Roy.
What they was was a bunch a' them Crispy Critters
And their leader was a space cadet
He says Sagittarius we has arrived.
Prepare to disembark men.
Get the incense goin' and the sitar out
We gonna camp in the city park man.
I says Boys let me explain the situation to ya.
A you're gettin' me down
And B we got us a leash law here
And C you in the wrong town.
You drop one string a' beads in that there park
And you gonna see a whole lotta stars.
You got fifteen seconds to get out of town boys
Or we gonna blow ya ta Mars.
Well they all got back in the purple bus
And proceeded to the city limits.
Then the telephone rang was the swimmin' pool
Says a mess a' wild Critters was in it
So we all got in the Marshal's Plymouth

Went flashin' on down to the swimmin' pool
To give them Critters a citation
By the time we arrived it was too damn late
Them critters is all had their pants down
Them dogs was tearin' the bathhouse apart
And they's after the fish in the fish pond
I says Roy you get the one in the silver Tshirt
And I'll get the rest with a net.
We gonna have a jail full a' naked Crispy Critters
And a dripdry space cadet.
You've watched The Dukes of Hazzard haven't you c'mon admit it nobody's looking. Well at this point in the song there's a short interlude which resembles a car chase on Dukes. There's banjo pickin' and yeehawin' and a general sense of raucous abandon. Oh yeah and a few dog barks. It's roundup time at the swimmin' pool.
Well we gave 'em hell but we lost the war
'Cause them Critters outnumbered us
So they moved in and set up camp
And they lived in that purple school bus
Six weeks later there was nothin' in town
But eightyfour dogs and a head shop
Sellin' dried up weeds and sunflower seeds
And astrological postcards
Yeah Critters took over the City Council
And the dogs all barked their brains out
And the whole damn town was Crispy Critters
And the mayor was a space cadet <start> 
I've never once in my life met someone like you
I don't know what the word blue means
As long as I'm with you
You fill me so completely through everything you do
Blue is not a word at all
As long as I'm with you
Most of the time in my past
Blue is all I knew
But now that we're together
O' how I love you
I'm so glad I've found you
You've made my dreams come true
Blue is not a word at all
As long as I'm with you
Most of the time in my past
Blue is all I knew
But now that we're together
O' how I love you
I'm so glad I've found you
You've made my dreams come true
Blue is not a word at all
As long as I'm with you <start> I slept sweetly unpretending
That the night was always ending
She breathed lightly right next to me
And I dreamed of her inside of me
And in my dream she sang so sweetly
A melody I hope to sing
So enslaved by her sweet wonder
It cut my legs and fingered hunger
She sang my name and so engulfed
I cried and felt my legs fail
In her arms I trembled electric
Oh and she let me and she held me
Then waking she was older still
And holds my love against its will
In spell cast with her palms extended
Cursed love is never ending
Cursed eyes are never closing
Cursed arm are never closing
Cursed children never rising
And cursed me never despising
Oh I am loving always holding
While she sleeps her song enfolding
Epic song it tells of how
She and I are living now
Dawn cursed love  <start> You hear the silence broken by an old familiar voice
Could it be your talkin' to the walls
You've tossed for just a moment and then you realized
That it's just a memory callin' and that's all
A day that last forever is nothin' but a moment
Compared to the night that's yet to come
For there's nothing quite as lonely as a bed that's been slpet in by one
A day that last forever <start> HE'S EVERYWHERE

He walks in my mind like the shadow someone speaks his name and he appears
I can see his face in total darkness oh he's everywhere
He left a mem'ry that lives with me a mem'ry of how it used to be
And I remember all the things we used to share oh he's everywhere
He waits in the corners of my mind and in the stillness of the night he walks
around
Sometimes the memory's so real I think he's really there oh he's everywhere
He left a mem'ry that lives with me...
Oh he's everywhere <start> Children say that words will never harm you
Only sticks and stones will make you cry
But they'll grow up one day and learn the real truth
When the one they love says goodbye
The hardest part of living is loving
'Cause loving turns to leaving every time
And the hardest part of leaving is living
Life is hard when love is so unkind
Life is hard when love is so unkind
I don't trust old sayings any longer
Most are only decorated lies
Absence doesn't make the heart grow fonder
And out of sight don't mean out of mind
The hardest part of living is loving
'Cause loving turns to leaving every time
And the hardest part of leaving is living
Life is hard when love is so unkind
Life is hard when love is so unkind <start> Roll in my sweet baby's arms

You walked in the streets with another man
And wouldn't even go my bail
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's arms

'Til the mail train comes back
An' I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms
I know that your daddy don't like me
He drives me away from your door
And if I had to do it once again
I'd never go there anymore

The Keys To Death Hell And The Grave <start> Another twenty miles and I'm halfway there
Another twenty miles and I'm running scared
It's a beautiful night and I should be there
I know you are tired of waiting
And I know you are tired of hesitating
If love gets there before I do
Darling don't you take it.
If love gets there before I do
Darling don' t you do it no don't you do it
I know you're hearing line from those other guys
Trying to wear you down under starry sky
But you know that I want you to just hold on
I know you are tired of waiting
And I know you are tired of hesitating
If love gets there before I do
Darling don't you take it.
If love gets there before I do
Darling don' t you do it no don't you do it <start> Go leave
She's better than me
Or at least she is stronger
She will make it last longer
That's nice for you
Go leave
Don't come back
No more am I for the taking
But I can't say that my heart's not aching
It's breaking in two
I remember days when we laughed a lot
Those that weren't so good I soon forgot
We could sit and talk till words
Were coming out our ears
Not just for days or weeks or months
But it's been years
Now here they come
Here they come here come my tears
So go leave
You said goodbye
But could it be that you are stalling
Hearts have a way of calling
When they've been true <start> The wind is blowing 'cross the mountains
And out on the valley way below
It sweeps the grave of my darling
When I die that's where I want to go
Lord send the angels for my darling
And take her to that home on high
I'll wait my time out here on earth love
And come to you when I die
Our names are carved upon the tombstone
I promised you before you died
Our love will bloom forever darling
When we rest side by side
I hear a voice out in the darkness
It moans and whispers through the pines
I know it's my sweetheart a calling
I hear her through the walls of time <start> Well you ain't that old but you ain't that young
You've lived a life but you ain't quite done
All eyes on you everywhere you go
It's all good till you get too close
Girl you're gonna hurt somebody
Make somebody bleed
Girl you're gonna hurt somebody
God I hope it's me
There's an innocence there this time of night
Is it in your words is it in your eyes
And your red lipstick like a smoking gun
It could be aimed at anyone
Girl you're gonna hurt somebody
Make somebody bleed
Girl you're gonna hurt somebody
And God I hope it's me
There's a simple truth to the morning sun
Things don't change they just light up
With a frontier mind and a restless heart
Girl you can't change the way you are
Yeah you're gonna hurt somebody
Make somebody bleed
Girl you're gonna hurt somebody
God I hope it's me
Yeah you're gonna hurt somebody
Make somebody bleed
Yeah you're gonna hurt somebody
And God I hope it's me <start> Down the way where the nights are gay
And the sun shines gaily on the mountain top
I took a trip on a sailing ship
But when I reached Jamaica I made a stop
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down my head is spinning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town
Sounds of laughter everywhere
And the dancing girls swaying to and fro
I must declare my heart is there
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down my head is spinning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town
Down at the market you can hear ladies
Cry out while on their heads they bear
Ackey rice salt fish are nice
And the run is good anytime of the year
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down my head is spinning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town
Sad to say I'm on my way... <start> You got another boy I hear he looks a lot like me
Doesn't come with some kind of guarantee
Well I got me another girl
She looks like you at twenty... three
While she sleeps I trace the places that your tattoos used to be
We don't gotta lie have you ever known
Us to take the night lying down alone
I don't wanna try
Was hoping you were home
Hoping this is still your phone

When I get lonely sure she'll do
But you're the only you
We were never very smart we were sticking to our guns
We knew we had it up babe we knew we were the ones
Forever barely starts then suddenly someone's
Saying all it said and done

When I get lonely sure she'll do
But you're the only you
I sprayed our names across the bridge
So the whole damn town would know
That bridge is gone
But some recall that whats his face hearts so and so
And so it goes... and so it goes

But when I get lonely sure she'll do
But you're the only
when I get lonely I make do
But you're the only youYou got another boy I hear he looks a lot like me <start> Give me that old time religion

It's good enough for me
Give me that old time religion

Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It's good enough for me <start> I used to spend my nights out
In a bar room
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reaching for the bottom
Brought me back from being too far gone
You're as smooth as Tennesee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of Brandy
And I stay stoned on your love all the time
I looked for love
In all the same old places
Found the bottom of the bottle's
Always dry
But when you poured out your heart
I didn't waste it
Cause there's nothing like your love
To get me high
You're as smooth as Tennesee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of Brandy
And I stay stoned on your love all the time
I stay stoned on your love all the time <start> I'll try anything that's new if something old won't do
If I can make you happy when you're feeling blue
Cause I love you yes I love you all of the time
I love every breath you take I love the love you make
I love the way you walk even when you walk away
Cause I want you yes I want you all of the time
But don't go too far when you walk away cause I want you near near me night and day
I can't do without things you do for me in your own sweet love able way
I love everything you do and everything you say
I love you most of all cause you always go my way
When I need you and I need you all of the time
But don't go too far <start> There's a sweet dream on your pillow
There's a sad song in your eyes
There's a sunshine behind a dark cloud
Up above you in fools thin air
She's an old friend she's a good friend
Hair of golden eyes of satin
She's a won't be long friend till she's gone friend
And leaves you hangin in fools thin air
Like a lion rules the jungle
You're just flyin' through fools thin air
That don't mean nothin' when you've got something
You believe in to get you there
She's an old friend she's a good friend
Hair of golden eyes of satin
She's a won't be long friend till she's gone friend
And leaves you hangin in fools thin air <start> Your beautiful eyes
Sparkle like two diamonds on fire
Why am I still surprised
At the way they make me feel
I thought I could get no higher
You showed me a whole new deal
It's not the way you look
Even though heaven knows you're a sight to see
It's not the way you look it's the way you look at me
It's not the way you look it's the way you look at me
Most any old time
Could be a special occasion
Just call me and I'm
Already halfway
You choose the destination
I'll go with you anywhere
It's not the way you look

Even though heaven knows you're a sight to see
It's not the way you look it's the way you look at me
Like I'm all you ever wanted me to be
It's not the way you look

Even though heaven knows you're a sight to see
It's not the way you look it's the way you look at me
It's not the way you look it's the way you look at me <start> It's been so long since you've crossed my mind
I find ways to pass the time
Chasing monkeys through the rings of hell
Suits me exceptionally well
And all my constituents agree
I've been changed like a pebble in the sea
By the politics of time
But riddle me this
What happiness is mine
That old comedian we lived above
Asked me to send his love
He's chasing Andy Warhols Brillo box
Down th Avenue in his socks
And all my constituents agree
He's been framed like the kid from Rosko Gee
By the politics of war
But riddle me this
What happiness is yours
I hope this letter finds you safe and well
Like an oyster in it's shell
I will see you when I take my rest
On the lunatic express
And all my constituents agree
We're as lost as a letter in the sea
In this universe of bars
But riddle me this
What happiness is ours <start> Oh there is a house in New Orleans.
They call the Rising Sun.
It's been the ruin of many young poor girls
And God I know I'm one.
My mother she was a tailor yeah yeah
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father he was a gamblin man
Down in New Orleans.
I got one foot on the platform yeah
The other foot on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain
Oh mother please tell your children oh yeah
Not to do what I have done
Go and spend their lives in sin and misery
In the house of the Rising Sun.
Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he will be satisfied
Is when he's all drunk.
Oh there is a house in New Orleans.
They call the Rising Sun.
It's been the ruin of many young poor girls
And God I know I'm one. <start> Old memories mean nothing to me
They've all gone away from me now
I'm alone in the night it's plain to see
And old memories mean nothing to me
It's the day that I'm thinkin' of
I've forgotten yesterday's love
So if you don't love me now set me free
For old memories mean nothing to me
Time has a way of passing by
Over the ruts of our lives it will fly
And if you don't love me now I can see
And old memories mean nothing to me
I know we once had a fine love
Over others you towered above
But I'm not the playful kind you can see
And old memories mean nothing to me <start> Old stars fall to the ground
Floors are flat and the moon is round
Grass is green and skies are blue
And girl I got a thing for you
Old trucks rattle down gravel roads
Rivers wind and the north wind blows
Raindrops fall on old tin roofs
Girl I got a thing for you
Dreamers dream and wishers wish
Talkers talk and fishers fish
Sunset's in the west each day
Don't ask me why it goes that way
Old cowboys ain't got much to say
Christmas comes on Christmas day
And I guess what I'm gettin' into
Is girl I got a thing for you
Farmers farm and painters paint
God is good and the devil ain't
Summer's hot and sidewalks crack
Don't ask me why it goes like that
Now slide on over next to me
Let me kiss those pretty red lips so sweet
And get lost in your eyes of blue
'Cause girl I got a thing for you
When it comes to you girl I'm a fool
'Cause I got a thing for you <start> Every day I clock out
And head straight to her house
We cuddle up on the couch
But it always ends the same ole way
I'm drivin' home and it's incredibly late
Somethin's got to change cause
I've been wrapped around her finger
Since the first time we went out
Every day and every night she's all I think about
I need that girl beside me
When the lights go out
I think it's time to put a ring on the finger
I'm wrapped around
Went to the bank took out a loan
Went and bought the perfect stone
Called up her dad on the phone
I'm takin' him to dinner Sunday night
I've never been so nervous in my life
I want to do this right cause
I've been wrapped around her finger
Since the first time we went out
Every day and every night she's all I think about
I need that girl beside me
When the lights go out
I think it's time to put a ring on the finger
I'm wrapped around
Yes sir I love her very much
I know it's only been seven months
But that's long enough
I've been wrapped around her finger
Since the first time we went out
Every day and every night she's all I think about
I need that girl beside me
When the lights go out
I think it's time to put a ring on the finger
I'm wrapped around
I think it's time to put a ring on the finger
I'm wrapped around <start> Got a country girl
With a country twang
She's a ridin in a little country thing
Baby blue jeans
Little mood ring
I can't wait to find out what that purple means
And she's a popin off the top of that sweet cherry chapstick
Hummin to the radio
We're lookin for a place if we can make a little magic
Green light take a ride dirt road
Here we go
I feel like the whole wide world is shining down on me
Right off a county road seven with a little piece of heaven
Her eyes and the sky just as blue as can be
Feelin kinda crazy
I'm just chillin with my baby on a saturday afternoon
Man I'm thinking maybe that I finally found my lady
And I think she feels the same way too
Oh ya
Hit the quick sack
Grab the six pack
And when we get there I can't wait to have a sip of that
And she'll be lookin so good
There sittin on that hood
My little kiss and tell bombshell aw hell
And it feels like the whole wide world is shining down on me
Right off a county road seven with a little piece of heaven
Her eyes and the sky just as blue as could be
Feelin kinda crazy
I'm just chillin with my baby on a saturday afternoon
Man I'm thinking maybe that I finally found my lady
And I think she feels the same way too
Oh ya
And it feels like the whole wide world is shining down on me
Right off a county road seven with a little piece of heaven
Her eyes and the sky just as blue as could be <start> I can't believe the things I hear and see but there you are
Just as real as I can be
You made me happy baby so very happy baby
Loving you has sure been good to me
It's really you this time it's really true cause I can feel
Something tingling through and through
Well I want to thank you baby for everything you gave
Loving you has sure been good to me
Loving you has sure been good to me
When I was tired and down on livin'
Before my heart done high on lovin' you
I can't recall one day it didn't rain on me
You made my dreams worth dreamin'
You made my song worth singin'
You made the sun come out and shine for me
Know for now I got alone without you up till now
You're what love is all about
You came along and loved me when I was cold and lonely
Loving you has sure been good to me
Loving you has sure been good to me
Loving you has sure been good to me
Loving you has sure been good to me <start> Darling let's turn back my years and go back to yesterday
Let's pretend that time has stopped and I didn't go away
We had our love to make us happy it wasn't meant to bring us tears
We had our love to make us happy... <start> In your heart of hearts there is a voice
It speaks from truth and not from choice
It sees it all not just in part
Deep inside your heart of hearts
A secret place known to your soul
Where you can't hide but you can go
When it's all too much and you fall apart
There's a state of grace called your heart of hearts
Just listen to your life it's talking to you
There'll always be a light that's running through ya
Flowing from a well that never runs dry
When you're at the point down on your knees
You can find your weakness can be your strength
Cause where one ends the other starts
Deep inside your heart of hearts
Just listen to your life it's talking to you
There'll always be a light that's running through ya
Flowing from a well that never runs dry
In your heart of hearts there is a voice
It speaks from truth and not from choice
It sees it all not just in part
Deep inside your heart of hearts <start> Who can blame you though your heart's untrue
When you say it's my fault anyway
You turn your head from the tears I've shed
Though your heart is untrue who can blame you
You justify yourself in your love for someone else
When you say I never loved you anyway
Your vows were made in vain although my love still remains
Though you broke my heart in two who can blame you
Who can blame you though your heart's untrue
When you say it's my fault anyway
You turn your head from the tears I've shed
Though your heart is untrue who can blame you
In a heart of rusty steel you kept your love affair concealed
'Til the day she was asking you to stay
You turned your head from the tears I've shed
Though you broke a heart in two who can blame you
Who can blame you though your heart's untrue
When you say it's my fault anyway
You turn your head from the tears I've shed
Though your heart is untrue who can blame you
Who can blame you though your heart's untrue
When you say it's my fault anyway
You turn your head from the tears I've shed
Though your heart is untrue who can blame you
You turn your head from the tears I've shed
Though your heart is untrue who can blame you <start> Baby please don't get too close to me
Cause that ring you're wearin'
Says that you're not free
But if I said I didn't want ya
Well you know I'd be a liar
You better run while there's still time
Cause I can't stop this fire
I want you bad I can't help myself
But you belong to someone else
I'd leave you alone darling if I could
But I want you bad and that ain't good
Baby please put away those ruby lips
And those big blue eyes
Are too hard to resist
I'm not that kind of man
Oh and usually I'm strong
But it's gettin' hard to tell between
What's right and what is wrong
I want you bad I can't help myself
I want you bad girl that ain't good
I want you bad bad bad that ain't good <start> It happened on a Sunday
Outside and the sun was shinning.
That look on your face
Oh it hit me so hard inside.
I could see how the light was fading
From your pretty blue eyes and
All I needed were the right words
But they were so hard to find.
In a second my world changed
So fast that my heart was breaking
I wrapped my arms around you
And I just kept saying your name and
I put your hands in my hands
And we dropped to the floor board crying
At the moment your heart gave up on us
I told you
I'll bring you back I'll bring you back
I'll bring you back to love I will
Bring you back I'll bring you back
I'll bring you back to love
I kissed your tears all falling down
I said baby you'll always be the one
Aw I'm never going to turn around
Your're all the life that I have in these lungs
We can all be scared to death
Never certain of what it is we want
All the fears we should confess
Holding our breath just dying to speak up
In a second my world changed
So fast that my heart was breaking
I wrapped my arms around you
And I just kept saying your name and
I put your hands in my hands
And we dropped to the floor board crying
At the moment that your heart gave up on us
I told you
I'll bring you back I'll bring you back
I'll bring you back to love I will
Bring you back I'll bring you back
I'll bring you back to love
I remember that night at your mama's house
We were so in love finally said it out loud
I got down on my knees said you're the best thing that ever happened to me
You walking down the aisle I remember it now
I remember your smile
I told you
I'll bring you back I'll bring you back
I'll bring you back to love I will
Bring you back I'll bring you back
I'll bring you back to love yeah
I'll bring you back to love
I'll bring you back to love <start> Lying here beside her I've come to understand
If you want to be happy you can
It don't take living like a king it doesn't cost you anything
All it takes is a woman and a man
Because its who you love and who loves you
Its not where you are if she's there too
It's not who you know or what you do
It's who you love and who loves you
This modern world we live in is a sad state of affairs
Everybody wants what isn't theirs
While the race for money and success in search of happiness
We turn out the light and go upstairs
Because its who you love and who loves you
Its not where you are if she's there too
It's not who you know or what you do
It's who you love and who loves you
So we hold each other tight
And own the world tonight
'Cause love is all that matters anyway
Because its who you love and who loves you
Its not where you are if she's there too
It's not who you know or what you do
It's who you love and who loves you
Its who you love and who loves you
Its not where you are if she's there too
It's not who you know or what you do
It's who you love and who loves you <start> In the Texas town of San Antonio
Is a little church they call the Alamo
The story tellers say Ozzy Osborne stopped one day
All dressed up in women's lingerie
I don't know if the guy was drinking beer
Jack or beam it's not exactly clear
But when he whipped it out
The ghost of Travis gave a shout
Whose message all good Texans still can hear
Don't go there don't go there
You really shouldn't go there
It's a source of Texas pride
Hell John Wayne died inside
Don't go there don't go there
You really shouldn't go there
You'll really piss us off if you go there
When Bowie and Young Crockett made their stand
Colonel Travis drew a line in to the sand
But it's simply not the same when you try and write your name
That bloody rocker must have mush for brains
Don't go there don't go there
You really shouldn't go there
It's a simple Texas mission
Not a pot for you to piss in
Don't go there don't go there
You really shouldn't go there
You'll really piss us off if you go there
Music never rilled us
The groupies or the jets
The show on television
Or the ratings you might get
The thing that drove us plum insane
Was when you drained that old main vain
Took your snake and let it go
No we won't forget the Alamo
The eyes of Texas are upon you
Don't go there don't go there
You really shouldn't go there
It's a symbol of our state
Not a place to urinate
Don't go there don't go there
You really shouldn't go there
You'll really piss us off if you go there
Don't go there
You really shouldn't go there
How ya like it then
If we piss upon Big Ben
Don't go there don't go there
You really shouldn't go there
You'll really piss us off if you go there
Ah you know Sharon I got me 
Cloths off put in the roadie's rooms
So I couldn't get out
So I just took a walk around town you know
And  the next thing I  know
I had to take me a piss you know
And there was this old wall and I thinking
What the  I'll  piss on the wall
Then all of a sudden
I'm in jail you know  police
Got me down and ah
Sharon Sharon <start> Not long ago I was thinking of home
And I wondered if Mama was there all alone
I thought I'd drop by as I'd done before
But the sound from within made me stop at the door
She was praying
A sound that the world seldom hears
Praying her words were pleading and dear
The sound of her voice as she spoke my name
Brought tears to my eyes My heart filled with shame
Praying praying for someone like me
I was walking one night and I felt so alone
My heart was so heavy from the trouble I'd known
I hadn't noticed a church that was near
Till the sound from within seemed to fill the air
They were praying
A sound that the world seldom hears
Praying the children that God loves so dear
Outside in the darkness I could not see
But I could picture them down on their knees
Praying praying for someone like me
Praying praying for someone like me <start> She's a homegrown naturalborn girlnextdoor
Never ever ever wanted anything any more
Than somebody who would love her
Just as much as she was gonna love him
Sweet little girl never had an evil thought
Till she caught him out being where he should've been not
In that minute it was ended and forever changed to never again
Chorus
Now she's breaking hearts and taking names
From now on she's making her own list of old flames
Look out boys it's a brand new game
Be on your guard she's breaking hearts and taking names
She's outgrown the notion love's made to last
That Cinderellasyndrome's a thing of the past
If you're thinking that she's waiting for another prince charming  get real
Just look at all the rookies lining up to take a shot
Got 'em slipping and atripping trying to show her what they got
Steppin' up to the plate not knowing that she's playing the field
Chorus <start> You and I gunna make a brand new start
Drag all we own out to the front yard
Make a big sign Everything is free
that's the last this town'll see of you and me
Hang on Annabelle
We gunna find ourselves down that long highway
Hang on Annabelle
We gunna ride like hell down that long highway
It's a long highway
Got all our cash stashed in a coffee can
Sleep in the backseat of this old sedan
Just like a bullet screamin' down the road
Straight into the heart of the great unknown
Hang on Annabelle
We gunna find ourselves down that long highway
Hang on Annabelle
We gunna ride like hell down that long highway
It's a long highway
instrumental
Hang on Annabelle
We gunna find ourselves down that long highway
Hang on Annabelle
We gunna ride like hell down that long highway
It's a long highway
such a long highway <start> Oh Pioneer I sing your song
Well it's the hymn of those who've gone before and those who carry on
Pioneer your work is hard
But the future of us all rests on the shoulders of your heart
Where are we going
Oh I don't know
But still I've got to go
What will become of us
Oh I don't care
All I know is I'll go anywhere
Pioneer
Oh Pioneer
So young and brave
Be careful of the careful souls who doubt you along the way
Pioneer you orphaned child
Your mother is adventure and your father is the wild
Where are we going oh I don't know
But still I've got to go
What will become of us
Oh I don't care
All I know is I'll go anywhere
Pioneer
Let your heart not be troubled
I won't run when bullets chase me
I won't rest where arms embrace me
I will love when people hate me
I won't hush no you can't make me
Send the dark but it won't break me
You can try but you can't change me
Take my life they will replace me
I won't hush no you can't make me
I won't hush no we will sing
Where are we going
Oh I don't know
But still I've got to go
What will become of us
Oh I don't care
All I know is I'll go anywhere
Pioneer
Let your heart not be troubled <start> Leaving here's been a long time coming
But I'm packed and my motor's running
There's nothing here I'm still needing
So I'm gonna let my heart lead me on
By the time you find me gone
I'll be living my life doing things my way
Taking the highway south
I lost my track but I'm getting it back
I've got it figured out
I'm living my life now
No more wasting my time regretting
Just giving and never getting
I'm taking my change at winning
I'm making a new beginning now
And before the sun goes down
I'll be living my life doing things my way
Taking the highway south
I lost my track but I'm getting it back
I've got it figured I'm living my life now
Everybody knows better what's better for me
And it's time that I'm breaking these chains so I can be free
I'll be living my life doing things my way
Taking the highway south
I lost my track but I'm getting it back
I've got it figured out
I'm living my life now <start> Was I nervous the night I first met you
Was it love at first sight
Did I know you were the girl I'd marry
I'd say that's right
When your daddy said Son do you love her
With all of your might
I looked him in the eye and said Yessir
I'd say that's right
I'd say that's right on the money
Sure as the summer in Florida's sunny
I'd say that's right down the middle
Ain't no doubt not even a little
Will I love you for the rest of my life
I'd say that's right
If I woke up tomorrow up in heaven
Saint Peter looked me in the eye
And said Mister would you rather be with her
I'd say that's right <start> What a wonderful thing that our love would have been tomorrow
What a pity that our dreams didn't stay around to see tomorrow
But your love has gone away and our dreams vanished too
Starved for so many things I intended to do
I'm alone with a love I meant to give to you tomorrow
I'll be the woman that you want tomorrow I got to many things to do today
Tomorrow I'll have lots of time to love you and I let it go another day
I promised all the love you'd need tomorrow
Say all the words you crave to hear me say
And somewhere in your lonely waiting hours
You packed your hungry heart and went away
What a wonderful thing our love would have been tomorrow
What a pity our dreams didn't stay around to see tomorrow
But your love has gone away and our dreams vanished too
Starved for so many things that I intended to do
I'm alone with a love meant to give you tomorrow <start> Since you went away I've had the blues everything is wrong since I lost you
Only God knows what I'm going through walk the floor and worry over you
Haven't slept a wink since you've been gone don't know how I'll stand this very long
Only God knows what I'm going through walk the floor and worry over you
 fiddle  steel 
Maybe someday you'll return to me and things will be the way they used to be
Only you can make my dreams come true walk the floor and worry over you
Haven't slept a wink... <start> Her telephone rang 'bout a quarter to nine
She heard his voice on the other end of the line
She wondered what was wrong this time
She never knew what his calls might bring
With a cowboy like him it could be anything
And she always expected the worst
In the back of her mind
He said it's cold out here and I'm all alone
I didn't make the short go again and I'm coming home
I know I've been away too long
I never got a chance to write or call
And I know this rodeo has been hard on us all
But I'll be home soon
And honey is there somethin' wrong
She said don't bother comin' home
By time you get here I'll be long gone
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man
He said I'm sorry it's come down to this
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss
But it's alright baby
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
Gotta go now baby
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
He left that phone danglin' off the hook
Then slowly turned around and gave it one last look
Then he just walked away
He aimed his truck toward that Wyoming line
With a little luck he could still get there in time
And in that Cheyenne wind he could still hear her say
She said don't bother comin' home
By time you get here I'll be long gone
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man
He said I'm sorry it's come down to this
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss
But it's alright baby
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
Gotta go now baby
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
She never knew what his calls might bring
With a cowboy like him it could be anything
And she always expected the worst
In the back of her mind <start> Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relived
How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed
Through many dangers toils and snares I have already come
Tis grace that has brought me safe thus far and grace will lead me on
When we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun
And than when we first begun <start> All you have to do now baby
Is pull on my heart strings
Let me know which ways to go
That's all right with me
Love me like a river darlin'
I'll love you like the sea
Love me anytime at all
'Cause that's alright with me
Ooh
Chorus
The night is tender
And the night is long
And I like what I see
There's a sparkle in your eyes
Like the stars in the sky
And I know what that means
Oh anytime or anyplace
Wherever we may be
Well we're wild and we're young
And we're free to love
And that's alright
That's all right with me
So close your pretty eyes now darlin'
Put me in your dreams
In your world of fantasy
That's all right with me
Well
Chorus
Yeah that's alright
That's all right with me
That's alright
That's all right with me <start> Baby when you're down
I'll be around
Baby when you're lost
I'll be your found
When the night is long
I'll be the crack of dawn
Baby when you take a shot
I'll be your sweet spot
Baby when you need to float
I'll be your lifeboat
When you want to play along
I'll be your Mah Jong
When you've done your best
I'll be your day of rest
Baby when you take a shot
I'll be your sweet spot
I'll be your sweet spot
Baby when you're falling off your feet
Out on a road that's rough and steep
And you're looking for a state of grace
I'll be your leap of faith
Baby when you're growing old
I'll be your solid gold
When your ship don't come in
I'll be your thick and thin
When your love is blind
I'll be your walk the line
When you've given all you've got
I'll be your sweet spot <start> Everything is free now
That's what they say.
Everything I ever loved
I'm going to give it away.
Someone hit the big score.
They figured it out
That we're gonna do it anyway
Even if doesn't pay.
I can get a tip jar
Gas up the car
And try to make a little change
Down at the bar.
Or I can get a straight job
I've done it before.
I never minded working hard
It's who I'm working for.
Chorus
Every day I wake up
Come in a song.
But I don't need to run around
I just stay home.
And sing a little love song
My love to myself.
If there's something that you want to hear
You can sing it yourself.
'Cause everything is free now
That what I say.
No one's got to listen to
The words in my head.
Someone hit the big score
And I figured it out
That we're gonna do it anyway
Even if doesn't pay. <start> I'm sorry I was weak enough to step out on you
Well I should have been strong enough not to step out on you too
I know that I'd hurt you and I stepped out for spite
Because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right
I'm not making excuses for myself I was wrong as I could be
But you shouldn't have cheapened yourself trying to get even with me
My conscience bothers me mine won't let me sleep at night
Because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right
Two wrongs don't make one right and now we both got heartaches
But if we both try we can forgive each other for our mistakes
We let no wonderful love slip through our hands we's better hold on tight
Because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right
Because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right <start> Reasons
We've got a million
To stop taking chances
And start playing it safe
Memories
Of old love can haunt you
I should be scared to death
But I can't walk away
Cause what if we fly
What if we fly
And dive off the edge of the end of the world as we know it
What if we fly
Have faith enough to think fate might just know where we're going
What if the arms of the wind carry us to the place
We never could find
Yes we might fall
But what if we fly
Answers
They don't come easy
I don't know what's wrong anymore
But I know when it's right
Only a dreamer
The truest believer
Can let the chains fall to the ground
And take to the sky
Cause what if we fly
What if we fly
And dive off the edge of the end of the world as we know it
What if we fly
Have faith enough to think fate might just know where we're going
What if the arms of the wind carry us to the place
We never could find
Yes we might fall
But what if we fly <start> What makes a man work until it's kids too old to kiss and hug
He won't climb another imaginary mountain when he is in love enough
What makes a man build a kingdom all that he'll lose his woman
How high is too high how big is too big
How far will we go just to slip of the edge
Yeah we all fall down
Live takes us out
The sky starts spinning
When our heads get above the clouds
The higher we fly the harder it feels when we hit the ground
Chorus
Yeah we all fall down
Yeah we all fall down
How does a man kick himself up when he smack himself down
Tell me where does he find the courage to turn its world back on well
Where he breaks down and cries like someone just died
What can you say about the men he used to be
When he can even speak and he is dying to scream
That we all fall down
When we find out
That the sky's not spinning when our heads get above the clouds
The higher we fly the harder it feels when we hit the ground
Chorus
If he's the only one to blame
And the only one to loose
How low he must go
To win back his sole
Chorus <start> Sometimes I want to throw my arms around you
Then I tremble at the thought of giving in
Because I know how much it cost to love you
And I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you revives the sorrow
That wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow
But I'm so afraid of losing you again
If heaven were to hear my heart's confession
Wanting you would be my greatest sin
But I'm glad that you're no longer my possession
'Cause I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you revives the sorrow
That wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow
But I'm so afraid of losing you again <start> Cowboys they are ladies men all right they'll love 'em up and talk 'em up all night
But they're lonely when there's nothing else to do
And that's what makes the cowboys sing the blues
He does a little Shakespeare and he sings he plays the mandolin and other things
He's looking for love beauty and IQ and that's what makes the cowboy sing the blues
Cowboys have to fall in love get hurt and all that bit
Let their hearts hang out so they can write you all a hit
So ladies if they ask you don't refuse let's all help the cowboys sing the blues
Cowboys they don't ever understand this thing between a woman and a man
Until they find the one they always lose
And that's what makes the cowboys sing the blues
A cowboy takes his lonely pen in hand and tries to make somebody understand
But she has ears to hear a different tune
And that's what makes the cowboy sing the blues
Cowboys have to fall in love...
Let's all help the cowboys sing the blues <start> Once followed by the wind
Once led astray by strangers from the shadows
Magnetized by teardrops fallin from clear blue eyes
Once forgotten by my friends
But remembered well time and again by sweethearts
Revitalized by raindrops fallin from clear blue skies
See there... it's just the way I told you it would be
See where... all the trouble lies
Will you stay and let my lonely heart behold you
Or fade away like mornin stars from the mornin skies
Once followed by the wind
Once chased around by demons from the darkness
Preconditioned by lies and fantasy
Once forsaken by my friends
But forgiven time and time again by sweethearts
Reconditioned by someone who fell for me
See there... it's just the way I told you it would be
See where... all the trouble lies
Will you stay and let my lonely heart behold you
Or fade away like mornin stars from the mornin skies <start> Oh the river of death 
Lies just before me 
Can I find a place 
That I can cross 
Or will I be 
In sin forever 
Oh Lord don't let  my soul be lost
Oh I wanna walk 
With Christ my Savior 
For He's the one 
That'll guide me on 
All through my life 
I've been a sinner 
Now I'm right with God  so I'm traveling home
Oh I can hear 
My Savior calling 
To me His voice 
Sounds sweet and low 
For me I hear 
My loved ones cheering 
Oh praise the Lord  I'm ready to go
Oh I wanna walk 
With Christ my Savior 
For He's the one 
That'll guide me on 
All through my life 
I've been a sinner 
Now I'm right with God  so I'm traveling home
My life down here 
Will soon be over 
And this old world 
Holds nothing for me 
He saved my soul 
And He made me happy 
That beautiful land  I'm going to see
Oh I wanna walk 
With Christ my Savior 
For He's the one 
That'll guide me on 
All through my life 
I've been a sinner 
Now I'm right with God  so I'm traveling home <start> Take that night train to Memphis take that night train to Memphis
When you arrive at the station

So don't turn down my invitation
Hallelujah Hallelujah

Oh we'll have a jubilee down in Memphis Tennessee

Let earth receive her king
Let every heart prepare him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing.
Joy to the earth the savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat repeat the sounding joy.
No more let sins and sorrows grow
Nor thorns infest the ground
He comes to make his blessing flow
Far as the curse is found
Far as the curse is found
Far as far as the curse is found.
He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of his righteousness
And wonders of his love
And wonders of his love
And wonders wonders of his love. <start> I was comin' off of a heartache
Addin' up all my mistake you know how it is
An' I was beatin' up myself up real good
Over all those shoulda coulds but never dids
An' I could lose myself in myself pity
But I done that an' that ain't pretty
An' somewhere in this mess I've made
Is my philosophy
That if you don't jump every chance you get
Roll a dice an' run some risks
If you don't fall then how you ever gonna fly
An' if you don't break an' you don't bruise
If you don't look back an' laugh at one or two
Wrong moves in your life
Yeah you ain't doin' it right
I've been flush an' flat broke
Made some lousy bets but that's okay yeah that's all right
'Cause never gamblin' never losin'
Is a sorry substitution for livin' life
Yeah I've got scars that I'm proud of
I've been down but I got up
An' the only thing I know about love is
There ain't no guarantees
So if you don't jump every chance you get
Roll a dice an' run some risks
If you don't fall then how you ever gonna fly
An' if you don't break an' you don't bruise
If you don't look back an' laugh at one or two
Wrong moves in your life
Yeah you ain't doin' it right
So go ahead an' put the bow to the fiddle
Pick you a spot an' jump in the middle
Love just a little
Then love just a little more
If you don't jump every chance you get
Roll a dice an' run some risks
If you don't fall then how you ever gonna fly
And if you don't break an' you don't bruise
And if you don't look back an' laugh at one or two
Wrong moves in your life
Yeah you ain't doin' it right
You ain't doin' it right <start> I came home early just to see you
Drove all through the night to be with you
I even stopped along the way
Just to buy a big bouquet
For all the things I didn't do
A note is on the kitchen table
I can't imagine what it's there for
I can hear you down the hall
But you won't answer when I call
Why's your suitcase by the door
I won't let you walk away
Like there's nothing left to say
If you would look me in the eye
I know you'd never say goodbye
You couldn't leave me face to face
I won't give up without a fight
Ain't nothing wrong here we can't right
I won't let you walk away
Say it's not too late to hold you
And take back all I never told you
Can't you feel what's in my heart
Your leaving's tearing me apart
There's just no living without you
You couldn't leave me face to face
I won't give up without a fight
Ain't nothing wrong here we can't right
I won't let you walk away <start> You left me and you went away
You said you'd be back and just that day
You've broken your promise and you left me here alone
I don't know why you did dear but I do know that you're gone
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
Now darling you know I love you well
I love you more than I can ever tell
I thought that you loved me and always would be mine
But you went and left me here with troubles on my mind
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
Now someday you may be lonesome too
Walking the floor is good for you
Just keep right on walking and it won't hurt you to cry
Remember that I love you and I will the day I die
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks in two
Walking the floor over you <start> I made five hundred miles in six hours flat
Trying to make up for lost time
I been beatin' a path to your mama's door
To set things between us right
Between the hands of fate and a lot of hard luck
This ain't been no gravy train
And I didn't come this far just to walk away
I slung a rod just east of Memphis
And that heap of a truck shut down
So for nine cold hours I thumbed my way
Straight to the guitar town
And the last twelve miles to your mama's house
I hiked through the pouring rain
And I didn't come this far just to walk away
I could have turned around a thousand times
And went back to where I'm from
But I'd go an extra million miles
If I could save what's left of us
Oh it was a burning love that drove me here
And girl I hope and pray
That I didn't come this far just to walk away
I know that this front door ain't the only thing
That stands between you and me
All the things that I've said and the wrong that I've done
Ain't undone easily
But I'm gonna prove my love to you
No matter what it takes
'Cause I didn't come this far just to walk away
Oh I could have turned around a thousand times
And went back to where I'm from
But I'd go an extra million miles
If I could save what's left of us
Oh it was a burning love that drove me here
And girl I hope and pray
That I didn't come this far just to walk away
Oh I didn't come this far just to walk away <start> Dooley was a good ol' man
He lived below the mill
Dooley had two daughters
And a fortygallon still.
One gal watched the boiler
The other watched the spout
And momma corked the bottles
When ol' Dooley fetched them out.
CHORUS
Dooley slipping up the holler
Dooley trying to make a dollar
Dooley give me a swaller
I'll pay you back some day.
The revenuers came for him
Slipping through the woods
Dooley kept behind them all
He never lost his goods.
Dooley was a trader
When into town he'd come
Sugar by the bushel
And molasses by the tub.
CHORUS
I remember very well
The day ol' Dooley died
The women folk looked sorry
The men stood around and cried.
Now Dooley's on the mountain
He lies there all alone
They put a jug beside him
And a barrel for a stone.
CHORUS <start> Came home to a house
Where everything was emptied
They took my T.V. and my chair
They even found her jewelry
And the police say there's nothing they can do
'Cause it happens everyday
Before I fell asleep when she was cryin'
This is all I could say
What in the world is this world coming to
Can't have a damn thing nice no use to try to
What is one man feelin' helpless supposed to do
What is in the world is this world comin' to
Come home to a house
Where everything was emptied
She left my T.V. and my chair
Now I' lost in memories
And my friends tell me there's nothing they can do
'Cause it happens everyday
And as I fell asleep that night cryin'
This is all I could say
What in the world is this world coming to
Can't have a damn thing nice no use to try to
What is one man feelin' helpless supposed to do
What is in the world is this world comin' to <start> She's perfect for a cotton dress
Pretty when her hair's a mess
A little wine and she gets a little loud
Once or twice she's bleached my jeans
She's been known to burn the beans
But in my heart there's never been a doubt
She's right as rain on a thirsty cornfield
Right on the money 'bout the way that I feel
A cool breath of fresh air
When life tries to burn me down
She's right behind me when I doubt myself
With a little push and a hand to help
A Quiet comfort on a troubled night
Right beside me yeah she's always right
Well she's the first to speak her mind
Never been the quittin' kind
She likes chocolate about as much as she likes me
She likes talking on the phone
Calls the mall her second home
I love that girl
Yeah she's just right for me
She's right as rain on a thirsty cornfield
Right on the money 'bout the way that I feel
A cool breath of fresh air
When life tries to burn me down
She's right behind me when I doubt myself
With a little push and a hand to help
A Quiet comfort on a troubled night
Right beside me yeah she's always right <start> You still smile at me when I come home and you always ask me how my day has been
You dry your face to make me feel there's nothing wrong
As we start another evening of return
You sit and wait for me to tell my usual lie at all excuse to get away from home
And I help you with your coat and straighten up your tie
But as you leave I'm reaching for the phone
This is not a home it's a place where we change close
And walk the floor and wait and watch the clock
No it's not a home this is one of those situations known as marriage on the rocks
You wait from nine to five pretending I'm at home
And yet you know I meet him secretly
How much longer must this game of decieve go on
We'd both be better off if we were free
No it's not a home this is one of those situations known as marriage on the rocks <start> Took a trip on a bus that didn't know
Met a girl sellin' drinks at the disco
Said truth comes back when you let it go
Seem complicated cause it's really so simple
Walkin' down Yonge Street on a Friday
Can't follow them gotta do it my way
No fast lane still on the highway
Movin' in and out no doubt there's a brighter day...
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
Ahh haa... check out the crabs in the bucket
It's like flies on the windscreen writing on walls
square biz clones claim they're havin a ball
feelin' themselves just before last call
Ticaticatoc ticaticatoc
Clock strikes twelve clock strikes one
Smoking gun put these fools on the run
I know it's not that simple I know it's not that hard
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
Ahh haa... check out the crabs in the bucket
It's a conniption fit from the microphones flit
I take it higher like a bird on a wire retire the fire
I never cause I'm just moving on up
Choosin' to touch the unseen craving the clutch
Damm if mirrors were created by sand
then I'm looking in the water for reflections of man
Understand the minds above time when it's empty
Emcee Tragically Hip  Ahead by a Century
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
Ahh haa... check out the crabs in the bucket
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
Ahh haa... check out the crabs in the bucket <start> Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child a long way from home
A long way from home always wanderin'
Sometimes I feel like my life's not worthwhile
Sometimes I feel like my life's not worthwhile
Sometimes I feel like my life's not worth while a long way from home
A long way from home a long way from home <start> There's a village hidden deep in the valley among the pine trees half forlorn
And there on a sunny morning little Jimmy Brown was born
All the chapel bells were ringing in the little valley town
And the songs that they were singing was for baby Jimmy Brown
And the little congregation prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation bless this hour of meditation guide him with eternal love
There's a village hidden deep in the valley beneath the mountains high above
And there twenty years thereafter Jimmy was to meet his love
All the chapel bells were ringing twas a great day in his life
For the songs that they were singing was for Jimmy and his wife
And the little congregation prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation bless oh Lord this celebration
May their lives be filled with love
From the village hidden deep in the valley one rainy morning dark and grey
A soul which wait in the heaven Jimmy Brown had passed away
Just the lonely bell was ringing in the little valley town
Twas there well it was singing to our good old Jommy Brown
And the little congregation prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation may his soul find this salvation of Thy great eternal love <start> 
I'd rather live a life of lies and fantasy
Than to face the truth and realize you're leaving me
You built me up so high my heart can't stand the fall
And life without your love just isn't life at all
So walk out backwards if you must go
And please don't wave goodbye just wave one last hello
The truth won't hurt so much if I can't just pretend
So walk out backwards and I'll think you're walking in
You walked into my heart in search of sympathy
And from that day down to this you've walked all over me
And now you're walking out to find somebody new
But you're not by yourself cause my heart's leaving too
Walk out backwards
Walk out backwards and I'll think you're walking in <start> Out in the cold world and far away from home
Some mother's boy is wanderin' all alone.
No one to guide him or keep his footsteps right
Some mother's boy is homeless tonight.
Bring back to me my wandering boy
For there is no other who's left to give me joy
Tell him that his mother with faded cheeks and hair
Is at the old home place awaiting him there
Out in the hallway then stands a vacant chair
And an old pair of shoes he used to wear
Empty is the cradle he used to love so well
Oh how I miss him no tongue can tell.
Well I remember those parting words he said
Well meet up yonder where tears are never shed
In that land of sunshine away from toil and care
When life is over I'll meet you up there <start> Well I've got two lovers and I ain't ashamed
Two lovers and I love them both the same.
Let me tell you 'bout my first lover.
He's sweet and kind and he's mine all mine.
He treats me good like a lover should and makes me love him
I really really love him
Oh I love him so
And I'll do ev'rything I can to let him know.
Well I've got two lovers and I ain't ashamed
Two lovers and I love them both the same.
Let me tell you 'bout my other lover.
He treats me bad makes me sad
Makes me cry but sill I can't deny that I love him
I really really love him
Oh I love him so
And I'll do ev'rything I can to let him know.
Darling Well Don'tcha know that I can tell whenever I look at you
That you think that I'm untrue
'Cause I said that I love two
But I really really do.
'Cause you're a split personality.
And in reality both of them are you.
Well I've got two lovers and I ain't ashamed
Two lovers and I love them both the same.
Well I've got two lovers and I ain't ashamed
Two lovers and I love them both the same.
Well I've got two lovers and I ain't ashamed <start> Take a letter Miss Gray it must go out today
And I think you already know what it's gonna say
It's to the one I'm tied to the one I'm leaving for you
Tell her that it's all over and I can't help what I do
Make it straight and to the point there's no use lying that won't do
Make three copies one for her one for me and one for you
And you can tell her you're the one and just sign it simply John
And oh yes PS please forgive what I've done
 steel 
Make it straight... <start> I can't have this conversation
Without lots of reservations on the line
If there's a way to slip around it
Then I'm bound to get around it one more time
Honey you are so persuasive
But it makes me more evasive when you pry
You can label me elusive
But the facts are inconclusive at this time
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind
I've got roses growing over what you'd find
But keep on asking if you're inclined
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind
I don't mean to drive you crazy
Comin' off all vague and hazy just because
I don't have an answer for you
I just wouldn't want to bore you if it does
But keep on asking if you're inclined
But you can't handle what's on my mind
No you can't handle what's on my mind. <start> 
I look at you and I see something special
I feel something special something that's rare
If you feel the same way when you're lookin' at me
I know there could be a love we could share
Won't you come and love with me
Shelter your love in my castle of dreams
We'll find in each other the things that we need
Won't you come and love with me
We'll sing us a love song the songbirds would envy
A song that the angels would be proud to sing
We'll say with our hearts what no poet could capture
Say with our eyes what no artist could paint
Won't you come and love with me
Shelter your love in my castle of dreams
We'll find in each other the love that we need
Won't you come and love with me <start> I never want to leave when I do
I never want to leave when I do
Every time I leave you cry
Stay by my side
Oh baby you should know I trust you
And baby you should know I'll miss you
But every time you leave I cry
Stay by my side
Just because I've gone away
Doesn't mean I'll be gone forever
There's a point in our love
From across the world
I never want to leave when I do

I never want to leave when I do

Every time I leave you cry
Stay by my side <start> Mary Had A Little Lamb

 <start> I'm not too much of a woman at least that's what you say
But you want me to get over love and it just don't work that way
You tell me I'm failing you when I've done all I can
I'd be more of a woman if you'd be more of a man
I'd be more of a woman the way you want me to be
But you've gotta show me a better man if you gonna see the best of me
If I'm gonna make you happy you gotta give me a helping hand
I'd be more of a woman if you'd be more of a man
You don't know much about women not near what you think you do
You think when you snap your fingers I ought to fall all over you
You're always talking bout other girls I can do anything they can
And I'd be more of a woman if you'd be more of a man

He takes the train into the city
To him it's more than just a working day
Cause he knows he can change the world in his ordinary way
She's got a job she has a family
She tries to keep them both together
She's barely getting by saving everything she makes
Day by day it seems it's getting harder to win
How much longer ready for their ship to come in
These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the working man
Trying to survive staying alive giving it all that he can
With a fire in his soul that keeps burning
And a dream in her heart that won't die
Living day to day there's no easy way in this everyday life
They started out as high school sweethearts
He promised her a life of luxury
And though they don't have riches they have everything they need
The eyes of her child are her diamonds
The gift of his love are her pearls
Together they plan taking a stand to make this a better world
But never breaking knowing that their dreams will begin
Getting stronger in each other's arms
These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the modern world
There's a spirit inside that keeps us alive giving it all that we can
With a fire in our soul that keeps burning
And a dream in our hearts that won't die
Living day to day there's no easy way in this everyday life
Everybody has a special reason
There's a chosen road to follow
Just remember nothing good comes easy
Don't surrender till you you find your rainbow
These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the working man
Trying to survive staying alive giving it all that he can
With a fire in his soul that keeps burning
And a dream in her heart that won't die
Living day to day there's no easy way in this everyday life
These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the modern world
There's a spirit inside that keeps us alive giving it all that we can
With a fire in our soul that keeps burning
And a dream in our hearts that won't die
Living day to day there's no easy way in this everyday life <start> Well I'm a loser yes a loser born loser every time
I find a new love yes I think true love then I find out that she's not mine
I couldn't be so lucky this next time as to find me a love so true

Well I'm a loser yes a loser born loser every time
Well I'm a loser yes a loser <start> Corrine Corrina where you been so long

Ain't been no lovin' since you been gone

I love Corrina tell the world I do <start> When you drove me to the airport
And kissed me goodbye
I had to smile through my tears
At those tears in your eyes
I was just leaving you for a week
But you held me so tight
When you called me long distance
To make sure I'd arrived
You said the house felt so empty
And you apologized for being weak
But can't you see
That's when you're a man to me
When you show your tender side
When your heart is open wide
When you put your world on hold
And stop to listen to my needs
When you really let it show
That I'm a part of all your dreams
That's when you're a man to me
The strength of your arms
Thrills me so much
But you make the earth move
With the softness of your touch
And the love that you give me
Will always be enough
You've got nothing to prove
You've got nothing to hide
And you impress me the most
When you don't even try
When your feelings shine through
Oh that's when you're a man to me
When you show your tender side
When your heart is open wide
When you put your world on hold
And stop to listen to my needs
When you really let it show
That I'm a part of all your dreams
Oh that's when you're a man to me
When you put your world on hold
And stop to listen to my needs
When you really let it show
That I'm a part of all your dreams
Oh that's when you're a man to me <start> Each night I leave the bar room when it's over
Not feeling any pain at closing time
But tonight your memory found me much too sober
I couldn't drink enough to keep you off my mind
Tonight the bottle let me down
And let your memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let me down
I've always had a bottle I could turn to
And lately I've been turning everyday
But the wine don't take effect the way it used to
And I'm hurting in an ol' familiar way
Tonight the bottle let me down
And let your memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let me down
Tonight the bottle let me down <start> The next voice you hear will be your conscience
As you lie awake and try so hard to sleep
And your unfaithful heart will have to listen
To those shabby little secrets you keep
You'll be tormented like you tormented me
And tears of shame will fall with every memory
Oh the next voice you hear will have to listen
And you'll wish that you had listened to me
Your conscience is making a record of everything you do and say
And when your conscience plays that record back to you
You won't like the things you hear it say
You'll be tormented... <start> Pain is growing like a vine stranglin' my heart
When I think the worst is over that's right when it starts
Someone says your name sometimes I don't feel a thing
But then there's days like today whoa that are suffocating
When I think it's dead and gone
Then it starts to rain oh and it grows again
I find myself out in your driveway
My hands are frozen on the wheel
And I can feel your love still suffocating
The memory of what used to be cuts me like a thorn
Loneliness starts rollin' in like thunder from the storm
My strength starts to sway I feel the winds of change
It's such a paralyzing place oh and it's suffocating
When I think it's dead and gone
Then it starts to rain oh and it grows again
I find myself out in your driveway
My hands are frozen on the wheel
And I can feel your love still suffocating
Let the rain wash it all away
Can't you love me another day
I curse myself
Cause nothin's changed nothin's changed
When I think it's dead and gone
Then it starts to rain oh and it grows again
I find myself out in your driveway
My hands are frozen on the wheel
And I can feel your love still
Suffocating <start> If I listen long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe its all true
Knowing that you lied straight faced while I cried
Still I'd look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you
Makes it hard to live without somebody else
Someone like you
Makes it easy to give and never think of myself
If I gave you time to change my mind
I'd find a way and I'd leave the past behind
Knowing that you lied straight faced while I cry
Still I'd look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you
Makes it hard to live without somebody else
Someone like you
Makes it easy to give and never think of myself
If I gave you time to change my mind <start> DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL

Like angels that sing a heavenly thing and you're daddy's little girl <start> Midnight drive down on Jewella Rd.
Methamphetamines and carryin a lonely load
Roaches in the ashes truck jamming Limelight
Look like it's gonna be just me and Geddy Lee tonight
Shreveport Oh Shreveport
Wonder where I'll be when the sun comes t' shine
Glasspacks hummin by Circle In The Square
Heavy Metal Rednecks and their frizzy blonde hair
Fuck a bunch a hairdo boys and their Spandex britches
And their big titty fancy drunk ass bitches
Shreveport Oh Shreveport
Wonder where I'll be when the sun comes t' shine
David Green called me to pick him up after work
Said to bring him some cold beer and a fresh clean shirt
Said he was already broke and he just got paid
We spent the rest of the night singin' by his Mama's grave
Shreveport Oh Shreveport
Wonder where I'll be when the sun comes t' shine <start> I'll just call you darling and I'll call you the same
And if we ever cry out in the night we won't call each other's name
I'm afraid that I'm falling and I'm falling too
But we both belong to others we're not free
I know I'll dream about you but if you'll call my name
We'll both hurt someone who shouldn't be
So I'll just call you darling...
 steel 
I didn't mean for it to happen and we can't turn back time
But it just happened we can't help it now
I have no right to hurt her and he's still in love with me
Why we're the ones who broke our wedding vows
So I'll just call you darling... <start> JUST OVER IN THE GLORYLAND

Forget the rules to this filthy game
I'm still your fool and I'm not ashamed to say
Your voice the song stuck in my head
Your scent the scent that paints my bed
If not for your faith then I'd be dead today
I know you had to go
Everything I did and didn't say
I know you had to go
But please don't fade away
On nights when I feel dead inside
I drink too much and I take a ride
To find a place on the other side
Where my heart don't have to know
It's a desperate sky it's a lonesome call
It's a fog of shame and alcohol
And I wish to God that you would call
Cause I'm running out of road
I know you had to go
Everything I did and didn't say
I know you had to go
But please don't fade away <start> She took my love
She wore it down
And it looked good all over town
But ill be ok
She shot me at sunrise right between the eyes
She shot me at sunrise right between the eyes
So come on so come on with me now with me now
And be my waiting gun
What could I do she blew me away
She took my love oh she took it she gave it away
But ill be ok
She shot me at sunrise right between the eyes
She shot me at sunrise right between the eyes
So come on so come on with me now with me now
And be my waiting gun
Talk with her and onto you
So be my gun until were through until were through
Until were through until were through
She shot me at sunrise oh right between the eyes
She shot me at sunrise oh right between the eyes
So come on so come on with me now with me now
And be my waiting gun <start> Actual Delmore Brothers lyrics which are pretty much the same as Doc's who is performing with Merle Travis.
instrumental intro
Chorus
Blow yo whistle freight train
Take me on down the line
Blow yo whistle yodel 
Got rambling on my mind.
Instrumental chorus
That old freight train moving along to Nashville
Hold a charm that is a charm for me
Makes me think of good old boomer days gone by
Makes me feel so lonely dont you see.
Chorus
Blow yo whistle freight train
Take me on down the line
Blow yo whistle yodel 
Got rambling on my mind.
Instrumental chorus
Got a feeling that Ill want to ramble
Still I know that that can never be
Guess Ill have to listen to that old smoke stack
Singing out this lonely song for me.

Blow yo whistle freight train

Chorus
Blow yo whistle freight train
Take me on down the line
Blow yo whistle yodel 
Got rambling on my mind. <start> If the windows need washin' if the grass needs mowin'
If the paint on the shutters is gone
If the kitchen seems so leakin' if the backdoor's a squeakin'
You've left her lonely too long
You've left her lonely too long too long too many nights you left her all alone
So if you started hurtin' then there's one thing for certain
You've left her lonely too long
If there's no curtains on the windows no clothes in the closet
If the clock on the mantel run down
If the floor you've started walkin' and if the neighbors have started talkin'
You've left her lonely too long
You've left her lonely
You've left her lonely too long <start> Do I Want You Yes I Do
Do I Need You Baby You Know It's True
But I Ain't Got Nothin' That You Can Use
So I'm Sittin' On My Own Here With These Poor Boy Blues
One Day Baby You Will See
You're Gonna Give All Your Love To Me
I'm The One Babe That You're Gonna Choose
But In The Meantime I Got These Poor Boy Blues
Pick It Son Pick It Nice
Things Won't Always Be The Same
Someday Soon Everything Will Change
You'll Tell Your Mama Her Baby's Got Good News
But Until Then Well I Got These Poor Boy Blues <start> Since you've gone
The moon the sun the stars in the sky
Know the reason why I cry
Love divine once was mine
Now you've gone
Since you've gone
My heart my lips my teardimmed eyes
A lonely soul within me cries
I acted smart broke your heart
Now you've gone
Oh what I'd give for the lifetime I've wasted
The love that I've tasted
I was wrong now you've gone
Oh what I'd give for the lifetime I've wasted
The love that I've tasted
I was wrong now you've gone <start> 
We got too much of a good thing goin'
We got too much to let it slide
We got too much of a feelin' flowing
We got too much got too much to let it die
Whatcha try'n to tell me boy
Whatcha try'n to do to me
You know you're my pride and joy
Don't leave me now don't leave me now
Around you my world revolves
Its a problem we can solve
Can it really be so involved we can't work it out
We'll work it out
'Cause we got too much of a good thing goin'
We got too much to let it slide
Yeah we got too much of a feelin' flowing
We got too much got too much to let it die
Won't you talk to me tonight
Let me hold you and love you right
Nobody's gonna know those eyes
The way I do I do know you
Maybe she's your fantasy
She can't love you more than me
Just touch me and you will see
You're forever mine forever mine
'Cause we got too much of a good thing goin'
We got too much to let it slide
Yeah we got too much of a feelin' flowing
We got too much got too much to let it die
Tell me what it is you want what it is you need
What it is that I ain't that I should be
I'll play your games I'll be your fool
If you want me to learn then take me to school
Maybe I'll show you
We got too much of a good thing goin'
We got too much to let it slide
Yeah we got too much of a feelin' flowing
We got too much got too much to let it die

I know that I should leave but then I just can't go you win again
This heart of mine could never see what everybody knew but me
Just trusting you was my great sin what can I do you win again
 strings 
I'm sorry for your victim now cause soon his head like mine will bow
He'll give his heart but all in vain and someday say you win again
You have no heart you have no shame you take true love and give the blame
I guess that I should not complain I love you still you won again <start> She's every reason I take so much work on
And every reason I take so much time at home
And every single reason why I'm so much stronger
And every reason I could never be alone
Look at me you'll see who I've found
I'm beside myself whenever she's around
Without her you'd see a different man
It's what she makes of me she's half the man I am
When the rivers all run dry she finds the water
And when everything is dark she finds the light
And when it's time to fly she's flying with me
With her on the wing we balance out just right
Look at me you'll see who I've found
I'm beside myself whenever she's around
Without her you'd see a different man
It's what she makes of me she's half the man I am
I'm what she's made of me she's half the man I am <start> IT ALL COMES BACK TO ME NOW
WRITERS JOAN WHITNEY ALEX KRAMER HY ZARET
It all comes back to me now a starry summer sky A laughing you and I alone. It all comes back to me now a sea of midnight blue Your face uplifted to my own. We called it a thrill of the moment and blamed the moon up above We didn't know what the glow meant we never dreamed it might be love. It all comes back to me now the love I threw away And now each lonely night I pray that it will all come back to me someday. <start> God's given us years of happiness here
Now we must part
And as the angels come and call for you
The pains of grief tug at my heart
Oh my darling
My darling
My heart breaks as you take your long journey
Oh the days will be empty
The nights so long without you my love
And when God calls for you I'm left alone
But we will meet in heaven above
Oh my darling
My darling
My heart breaks as you take your long journey
Fond memories I'll keep of happy ways
That on earth we trod
And when I come we will walk hand in hand
As one in Heaven in the family of God
Oh my darling
My darling
My heart breaks as you take your long journey <start> 
A long time ago when the earth was green
Well there was more kinda animals than you've ever seen
And they just run around free while the world was being born
And loveliest of them all was the unicorn
There was green alligators and long neck geese
Humpty bumpty camels and some chimpanzees
There was cats and rats and elephants but sure as you're born
The loveliest of all was the unicorn
But the Lord seen some sinning and it caused him a pain
He said stand back I'm gonna make it rain
So hey brother Noah I'll tell you what to do
Go and build me a floatin' Zoo
And you take 'em two alligators and a couple of geese
Two humpty bumpty camels and chimpanzees
Cats and rats and elephants but sure as you're born
Noah don't forget my unicorn
Now Noah was there and he answered the callin'
And he finished up the ark as the rain started fallin'
Then he marched in the animals two by two
And sung out as they went through
Hey Lord I got your two alligators and a couple of geese
Two humpty bumpty camels and chimpanzees
Cats and rats and elephants but sure as you're born
Lord I just don't see your unicorn
Well Noah looked out through the drivin' rain
But the unicorns were hidin' playing silly games
They were kickin' and a splashin' in the early morn
Oh them foolish unicorns
Then the ducks started duckin' and the sneaks started sneakin'
And the elephants started elephantin' and the boat started shakin'
The mice started sqeekin' and the lions started roarin'
And everyone's aboard but the unicorns
I mean a green alligators and long neck geese
The humpty bumpty camels and chimpanzees
Noah cried close the door cause the rain is a pourin'
And we just don't wait for them unicorns
And then the dark started movin' and it drifted with the tide
And unicorns looked up from the rock and cried
And the water came up and sorta floated them away
And that's why you've never seen a unicorn to this day
You'll see lots of alligators and long neck geese
You'll see humpty bumpty camels and chimpanzees
You'll see cats and rats and elephants but sure as you're born
You're never gonna see no unicorn <start> If I never get to heaven it will be for loving you
It's so easy for a heart in love to sin
Oh I want to go to heaven please believe me dear it's true
But I'm afraid the angels might let me in
Cause I'd steal and I'd lied to keep you by my side
And I even beg or steal if you wanted me to
Right or wrong I'll always love you till the world comes to an end
So if I never get to heaven I'll blame you

And I even beg or steal if you wanted me to...
So if I never get to heaven I'll blame you <start> I was waitin' in Rosie's Restaurant.
When the waiter came up and said what do you want
I looked at the menu and it looked so nice.
Till he said let me give you some advice
He said Spaghetti and potatoes got too much starch
Pork chops and sausage are bad for your heart.
There's hormones in chicken and beef and veal.
A bowl of ravioli is a dead man's meal.
Bread got preservatives there's nitrites in ham.
Artificial coloring in jellies and jam.
Stay away from donuts run away from pie.
Pepperoni pizza is a sure way to die.
Sugar rots your teeth makes you put on weight.
Artificial sweetner's got cyclamates.
Eggs got cholesterol there's fat in cheese.
Coffee ruins your kidneys and so does tea.
Fish got mercury red meat is poison.
Salt's gonna send your blood presure risin'
Hot dogs and bologna got deadly red dyes.
Vegetables and fruit are sprayed with pesticides.
So I said what can I eat that's gonna make me last
He said a small drink of water in a sterilized glass
Then he stopped and he thought for a minute.
He said Never mind the waterThere's carcinogenics in it
So I got up from the table and walked out in the street.
Reliazing there was nothin' I could eat.
I ain't eaten for a month and I'm feeling fine...
Cause he did not mention beer whiskey women
and sweet red wine. <start> She pushed the door open
Turned the light switch on
She sleeps alone in our empty bed
I've been gone too long
Baby baby tomorrow
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I turn on some music
Miles and miles and miles
Another cup of coffee
To wake my weary eyes
Baby baby tomorrow
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I put the key in the back door
Walk quietly up the stairs
I'm gonna kiss her on the forehead
Until she realizes I'm right there
Baby baby tomorrow
Baby baby tomorrow
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home <start> When I started out to write this song
You and I were walkin' down the highway holdin' hands
I was gonna write about how much a woman's love can help a man
But somethin' kinda restless started stirrin' in my body
Before I even got my guitar out
And I'm glad I didn't waste my time writin' all these lovin' lines
I don't feel that way about it now
The only way to travel is to hit that big ole road by yourself
A man don't need his back or his brain loaded down with someone else
And when it starts to raining he don't have to find a shelter
For anybody's body but his own uh huh the only way to travel is alone
 dobro 
I guess I just felt sorry for you walkin' down the highway in the morning in the cold
Or else why would I let you tag along and start to searchin' out my soul
But thank the Lord the wind came up and blew a little common sense
Across the sandy deserts of my mind
Now I can leave you standing here and never shed a tear
And live like I should have all the time <start> Heaven knows how I am here with you
And heaven knows where this is leading to
After all the heartache I've been through
I won't give up on Love
Could have been the way you said 'hello'
Could be something deeper I don't know
Certain I don't want to see you go
So don't give up on Love
Breathe and breathe me in
Bless me with your honesty
Your gift for seeing how it is
Will we share this waking mystery
Walk together feeling found and free
Face the unhealed space in you and me
And not give up on Love
I breathe and breathe you in
You bless me with your honesty
Your gift for telling it like it is
Heaven knows how I am here with you
And heaven knows where this is leading to
But after all the heartache we've been through
Let's not give up on Love
After all the heartache I've been through
I won't give up on Love
On you... <start> No matter how you're tempted
Don't say yes to me
Don't make this night as smooth to lead me on
It's just that I'm so lonely and I need someone
I've been too lonely too long
Oh please be strong enough to refuse me
Before I let myself do something wrong
For down inside I'm not that kind of woman
I've been too lonely too long
Oh please don't take advantage of the situation
For I'm afraid that I'm too weak to resist temptation
When you're used to being loved
It's hard to live alone
I've been too lonely too long
I've been too lonely too long <start> You can dance
Every dance with the one who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the one that hold your hand
In the pale moonlight
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me
Oh I know
That the music's fine like sparklin' wine
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing
But while we're apart don't give your heart to anyone
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me
Baby don't you know I love you so
Can't you feel it with your touch
I will never ever let you go
I love you oh so much
You can dance
Go and carry on till the night is gone
Till it's time to go
If she asks
If you're all alone can she take you home
You got to tell her no
And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me
Ooh darling save the last dance for me
You can dance
Every dance with the one who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the one that hold your hand
In the pale moonlight
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me
Ooh darlin' save the last dance for me
Save the last dance for me
Dance dance dance dance <start> There's a hundred bluebirds
Up above the clouds
Putting all the color in the sky
And twice as many tear drops
there to wash it down
Every one's another lullaby
But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely
There's a world of trouble
Trying to take its turn
I can hear it shaking underground
And half a dozen lessons
I might never learn
Not until them troubles come around
But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely
There's a mile of blacktop
Where the road begins
It takes a time or two to recognize
Growing at the roadside
Scattered by the wind
Are everybody's unsaid sad goodbyes
But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely
You're the only one and only
Why'd you go and leave me lonely <start> Saturday night shes fancied up love of her lifes come to pick her up
Theres things in the past she tries to forget
Will he be late be there at all broken heart man its not her fault
Shes only in love cause shes shot through the heart
Chorus
There he goes hes doing it again hes out all night with all his friends
Shes on the couch her head in her hands
 AM. hes through the door Dog house roses scattered on the floor
Shes falling apart cause shes shot through the heart
Verse 
How many times must she cry through it all she stands by his side
He just cant shake monkey off his back
He knows hes wrong to make her cry whoa and God knows how hard hes tried
To do right by her says its so dam hard
Chorus
Maybe someday hell straighten up will it be too late will she have her enough
Shes only in love she says it so damn hard
She wont be there to watch him die packs those bags with tear drops in her eyes
Shes leaving him because shes shot through the heart
Chorus 
There he goes hes doing it again hes out all night with all his friends
Shes in her car her head in her hands
 am through the door dog house roses they dont work anymore
Cuz her note says good bye cause Im shot through the heart
No more cryin no no cause Im shot through the heart <start> Once I was a slave at the saw mill
Talk about a poor boy talk about a poor boy let me have a dollar bill
My work was so hard at the saw mill
Talk about a poor boy talk about a poor boy let me have a dollar bill
See my teardrops falling down my wife left the saw mill town
She said saw mill life had been a sin the gravy were too thin
I can't work no more at the saw mill
Talk about a poor boy talk about a poor boy let me have a dollar bill
 steel 
Well if you bring your wife to the saw mill
How you gonna please her how you gonna please her when she wants a dollar bill
She'll run away and leave you at the saw mill
Women like a dollar women like a dollar yes and women always will
See my teardrops falling down...
Women like a dollar women like a dollar yes and women always will <start> She said someday I'd understand
What love was all about
She said I could have the kids
She was movin out
Said she'd finally found a man
Who's dick was so much bigger
Then that scumbag motherfucker
Run off with a nigger
And to think I'd ate the pussy
Where that big black dick had been
And kissed the lips that sucked him off
Time and time again
It's enough to make a man throw up
Sure is hard to figure
How any decent girl could ever fuck
A greasy nigger
He treated her just like a queen
She gave him all my money
It looks like the joke's on me
But I don't think it's funny
That pussy ain't worth payin for
As far as I can figure
Cause there's nothing quite as worthless
As a white girl with a nigger
And to think I'd ate the pussy
Where that big black dick had been
And kissed the lips that sucked him off
Time and time again
It's enough to make a man throw up
Sure is hard to figure
How any decent girl could ever fuck
A God damn nigger
So for all you nigger lovin whores
This song is just for you <start> She don't call me 'baby' no more
No more kisses at the door
She's got such a beautiful smile
But I haven't seen it in a while
I guess this is how it feels
When you're steppin' on the heels
Of a heartache
We'd go hear Charlie B. sing
Every friday night it was our thing
Charlie asks me why i'm alone
Well I say lately she just wants to stay home
She says there ain't nothin' wrong
But I know her better than anyone
And she can't disguise
The love that's missin' in her eyes
I guess this is how it feels
When you're steppin' on the heels
Of a heartache
Well this is more than a bump in the road
But I'm not ready to let go
I try again and again
But she just won't let me in
She says there ain't nothin' wrong
But I know her better than anyone
And she can't disguise
The love that's missin' in her eyes
I guess this is how it feels
When you're steppin' on the heels
Of a heartache
I guess this is how it feels
When you're steppin' on the heels
Yeah this is how it feels
When you're steppin' on the heels
Steppin' on the heels of a heartache
She don't call me 'baby' no more
She don't call me 'baby' no more
She don't call me 'baby' no more <start> Girl I caught you in your little white lie
Red handed red handed
You said you had to work tonight
But here you are dancing
Slow dancing
In this honky talk with someone else
And all you got to say for yourself
Is So
So
Sorry so
Chorus
So so long bye bye baby
I'll catch you on the flip side maybe
Don't you slip slide on a tear when you find me gone
Go go on cry cry baby
Those tears are gonna drip drop maybe
But you're gonna miss my good love baby
For so so long
so so long
Let me buy you a goodbye drink
Make it a double
A double
Cause I've seen everything I need to see
You're nothing but trouble
Big trouble
And one other thing before I go
I want to tell you that I think you're so
So so
Oh I ain't gonna sink that low
Chorus
I bet you think I'm gonna let it slide
The way you're flashing me those puppy dog eyes
Right yeah right.. Right
Wrong
Chorus
See ya <start> You're not a dream
You're not an angel
You're a woman
I'm not a king
I'm a man
Take my hand
We'll make a space
In the lives that we planned
And here we'll stay
Until it's time for you to go
Yes we're diff'rent worlds apart
We're not the same
We laughed and played
At the start like in a game
You could have stayed
Outside my heart
But in you came
And here you'll stay
Until it's time for you to go
Don't ask why
Don't ask how
Don't ask forever
Love me now
This love of mine
Had no beginning
It has no end
I was an oak
Now I'm a willow
Now I can bend
And tho' I'll never
In my life see you again
I still stay
Until it's time for you to go <start> Two doors down there's a jukebox
That plays all night long
Real sad songs
All about me and you
Two doors down there's a barmaid
That serves 'em real strong
Here lately
That's how I make it through
Two doors down there's a heartache
That once was my friend
Two doors down there's a memory
That won't ever end
Two doors down there's a barstool
That knows me by name
And we sit there together
And wait for you
Two doors down there's a bottle
Where I take out my shame
And hold it up
For the whole world to view
Two doors down there's a pay phone
But no calls come in
Two doors down there's a memory
That won't ever end
From the hotel to the barroom
It's just a stumble and a fall
And sometimes when it gets bad
I've been known to crawl
Freedom from sorrow
Is just two doors away
I'll escape for a short time
But I know I can't stay
Two doors down is where they'll find me
When you're finally through
Taking what's left of my life
Two doors down is where they'll leave me
When payment comes due
For the hours I've spent there each night
Two doors down I'll be forgotten
But until then
Two doors down there's a memory
That won't ever end
No it won't ever end <start> Baby wants me to go cold turkey bone dry
No Jack Daniels no Jim Beam whiskey bone dry
No stoppin' after work for a beer with the guys
Nothin' in the mornin' to open my eyes
Well I'm comin' down from a permanent high bone dry
I got my doubts if I can make it a bone dry
It's a crazy world I don't know if I can take it a bone dry
It's only been an hour I'm startin' to shake
Sixty more minutes and I know I'll break
How much more of this hell can I take bone dry
Well bone dry boy am I dry as a bone
How'd I ever say I'd ever leave it alone
Break down shake down layin' in bed
Covers are soaked and I'm damn near dead and I'm bone dry
Baby took a look at her cold turkey bone dry
I tried to smile but my mouth wasn't working I was bone dry
This is one promise that I'm gonna keep
Unless I get lucky and die in my sleep
One way or the other I'm gonna be bone dry <start> Don't you fall in love with me
Don't show me your affection
I can't give you what you want from me
I don't want the attention
I gave away my heart before
And it only caused me sorrow
How could I think of loving someone
Today or tomorrow
I've been so long confused
Was I loved or was I used
Now the sun goes up and down
And the weather rains and shines
I lost my heart somewhere
Oh I need to take more time <start> Don't it make you wanna go home now don't it make you wanna go home
All God's children get weary when they roam
Don't it make you wanna go home don't it make you wanna go home
Oh the whippoorwill roosts on the telephone poles when the Georgia sun goes down
Well it's been a long time but I'm glad to see that I'm
Goin' back down to my hometown
Goin' down to the Greyhound Station gonna buy me a oneway fare
Good Lord's willin' and the creeks don't rise watch it for I'll be right there
Don't it make you wanna go home now
But there's a six lane highway down by the creek
Where I went skinny dippin' as a child
And the drivein show where the meadow used to grow
And the strawberries used to grow wild
There's a drag strip down by the riverside where my grandma's cow used to graze
Now the grass don't grow and the river don't flow like it did in the childhood days
Don't it make you wanna go home now
Don't it make you wanna go home don't it make you wanna go home <start> Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today
Chorus
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Tennessee to those LA nights
The San Antone' to Vegas lights
Knock me down get back up again
You're in my blood I'm not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors
Chorus x
There was a distance between you and I
A misunderstanding once but now
We look it in the eye
There's no load I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors
Chorus x <start> Love left you nothing but lonely
Heartache is all you've had
This time around when it lets you down
You never had it so bad
I know its hard to keep going
When everything keeps going wrong
But don't you give up on fallin in love
Not while I'm here to lean on
Give me all of the pieces of your broken heart
And I'll put if back together again
No matter how your world is torn apart
Love can make the heartache end
Tonight it'll be all right
Just lie here in my arms
And give me all the pieces of your broken heart
I know the hurt you've been feeling
I've had some dreams hit the ground
All that you need is someone like me
Who knows where your dreams can be found
Give me all of the pieces of your broken heart
And I'll put if back together again
No matter how your world is torn apart
Love can make the heartache end
Tonight it'll be all right
Just lie here in my arms
And give me all the pieces of your broken heart <start> YOU DON'T KNOCK
Writer W. Westbrook and C.A. Walton
You don't knock you just walk on in the door to heaven's inn
There's love and joy for you to share the whole day through
I know my friends are there to rest in the heaven's nest
You don't knock ring punch a hole
The door's wide open just a waitin' for your soul
You don't knock just walk on in
I've traveled life's winding road tired with this load
I traveled both night and day so tired hardly bear
Now he's my guiding light and ever by my side
So I'm walkin' not knockin' to heaven with pride
Well you don't knock you just walk on in...
Well you don't knock you just walk on in... <start> When I stood on the top of a high high mountain
And watched the sun rise in the dawn
I walked by aside a cold cold river and heard the nightingale song
I once saw the king of a mighty nation the princess and I had a conversation
But the great big thrill of my whole life was falling in love with you
I salied many times in a deep deep ocean watched waters roll on many sands
Spent a night just a looking at a high high heaven and marvel that God's mighty hand
I tremble like a baby when I see a snowfall
Or standing in the forrest where the trees're so tall
But the great big thrill of my whole life was falling in love with you
Through the small port window of a big main whiner I watched the cities rush by
And the gay shining wings of a great steel eagle were just aburn in the sky
Well I walked by myself in the low low valley that every man could do
But the great big thrill of my whole life was falling in love with you
 fiddle 
Well I walked by myself in the low low valley that every man could do
But the great big thrill of my whole life was falling in love with you <start> I was born and raised in the Red Clay Hills of Texas
In the land where the grass gets only beer can tall
That's where I learned to cuss and fight and chew Brown Mule Tobacco
Fix windmills 'fore I was five years old
I rode every head of stock from the Gulf to Kansas City
And running wild is all I've ever known
But this cowboy's got a weakness for tight Levis and yellow ribbons
And there's something 'bout 'em I can't leave alone
Tight Levis and yellow ribbons make a cowboy swim a river
That before he jumps he knows is way too wide
And they'll make him throw a saddle on a bronc he's never seen
And one he knows he'll never break to ride
I met her at a rodeo in Douglas Arizona
I'd drawn the rankest horse a man could draw
Well I rode him tall and spurred him high and when I made the whistle
The crowd went wild but she was all I saw
That night we had a beer or two with friends of mine from Dallas
She smiled and said she loved the Texas drawl
And I felt like Roy Rogers did in all those cowboy movies
'Cause I became the hero got the money girl and all
Tight Levis and yellow ribbons make a cowboy swim a river
That before he jumps he knows is way too wide
And they'll make him throw a saddle on a bronc he's never seen
And one he knows he'll never break to ride
Yeah they'll make him throw a saddle on a bronc he's never seen
And one he knows he'll never break to ride <start> She just left the point at Kittanning
The train number 
And on down the mountain she travelled
So brave with her men in her crew
And the engineer pulled at the whistle
For the brakes didn't work when applied
And the brakeman climbed out on the car top
For he knew what that whistle have cried
With all of the strength that God gave him
He tightened those brakes with a prayer
But the train went right on down that mountain
Her whistle still piercing the air
She travelled that sixty an hour
Gaining speed every foot of the way
And than with a crash it was over
And there on the track the freight lay
Now it's not the amount of the damage
Or the value of what that rail cost
It's the sad scene they found in the cabin
Where the life of two brave men was lost
They found them at their post in the wreckage
Where they died when the engine had fell
The engineer still held the whistle
And the fireman still hung to the bell
Here the story is told of the freight train
But it should be a warning for all
We need to be prepared every moment
For we can never tell when he calls <start> I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses
And He walks with me and He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
I'd stay in the garden with Him
'Tho the night around me is falling
But He bids me go through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling
And He walks with me and He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known <start> So long fellas I gotta go
Told her I wasn't gonna be but an hour or so
I know she's bound to worry 'bout me and that old car
It's not that she don't trust me
But you know how women are
A few weeks back they took my job
The money's tight time's are gonna be hard
I know what's on her mind but she ain't said a word so far
She's tryin' not to let it show
But you know how women are
She's stands right beside me win or lose
She'll reach deep down inside and find a way to pull me through
She can see the silver lining in the darkest of news
She loves to hear me say I love you whispered in the dark
YOu know how women are
Sent her flowers the other day
We had words and you know I had my say
I knew right then that I was wrong I thought Damn my foolish heart
Because she means the world to me
And you know how women are
She's stands right beside me win or lose
She'll reach deep down inside and find a way to pull me through
She can see the silver lining in the darkest of news
She loves to hear me say I love you whispered in the dark
You know how women are
So long fellas you know are women are <start> Send me the pillow that you dream on
Don't you know that I still care for you
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darlin' I can dream on it too
Each night while Im sleeping oh so lonely
I'll share your love and dreams that once were true
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darlin' I can dream on it too
Send me the pillow that you dream on
Maybe time will let our dreams come true
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darlin' I can dream on it too
I've waited so long for you to write me
But just a memory is all that is left of you
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darlin' I can dream on it too
So darlin' I can dream on it too <start> I don't know just how it started once we were happy but now it's gone
You don't bother comin' home at night and I'd rather be free than be alone
So I'll kiss my wedding vows goodbye
And all those nights with nothing else to do but cry
You don't want me and I'll swear I don't know why
So I'll kiss my wedding ring goodbye
 steel 
Life's too short to be unhappy and the world is full of charmin' men
I love you but when love is onesided each day it gets harder to pretend
So I'll kiss my wedding vows goodbye...
I'll kiss my wedding ring goodbye <start> She said I don't usually dance this close to strangers
You know a girl can't be too careful with her heart
But I saw you and thought that you looked harmless
When you smile that way I'm not so sure you are
I said I don't usually come here for the dancin'
You can tell that by the way I move When I saw you
I thought that it was hopeless
And I just had to ask you for a dance or two
Somewhere in the stars it must be written
Girl we've got to take this chance that we've been given
If there's a heaven here on Earth
I think we found it
If this ain't love we're dancin' all around it.
Music stopped and we're still holdin' each other
This feels like the beginning of forever
Somewhere in the stars it must be written
Girl we've got to take this chance that we've been given
If there's a heaven here on Earth
I think we found it
If this ain't love we're dancin' all around it.
She said I don't usually dance this close to strangers <start> There's a well beaten path in the old mountainside
Where I wandered when I was a lad
And I wandered alone to the place I call home
In those Blueridge hills far away
Oh I love those hills of old Virginia
From those Blueridge hills I did roam
When I die won't you bury me on the mountain
Far away near my Blueridge mountain home
Now my thoughts wander back to that ramshackle shack
In those blue ridge hills far away
Where my mother and dad were laid there to rest
They are sleeping in peace together there
I return to that old cabin home with the sigh
I've been longing for days gone by
When I die won't you bury me on that old mountain side
Make my resting place upon the hills so high <start> You tell me that you don't like people
You can only believe in yourself
You pity all those who lack your higher breeding
So I can see the reason you don't have anybody left
Could it be the way you wear your fur on the inside
Prefer not to go outside where the sky's way too blue
Tonight you'll grace us with all your inner presence
While your backhanded compliments let the air out of the room
Hey don't rain on my parade and kill a perfect day wasting my time
Hey you always find a way to bring me down when I feel fine
We call you sunshine
I'm just an angel that sits upon your shoulder
Says the world will pass you over while you're waiting for a crown
You're no stranger to the art of how to fake it
You play until you break it you make it hard to be around
Hey don't rain on my parade and kill a perfect day wasting my time
Hey you always find a way to bring me down when I feel fine
We call you sunshine
We call you sunshine
Hey
Hey
Someday you'll be up on your mountain
High above the clouds where you can never be found
But you start a fire just to beg for intervention
You like the drama and attention God forbid we bring you down
Hey don't rain on my parade and kill a perfect day wasting my time
Hey you always find a way to bring me down when I feel fine
Hey don't rain on my parade and kill a perfect day wasting my time
Hey you always find a way to bring me down when I feel fine
We call you sunshine
We call you sunshine <start> Now come all ye hunters who follow the gun
Beware of your shooting at the setting of the sun
For Polly's own true love he shot in the dark
But oh and alas Polly Vaughn was his mark.
For she'd her apron wrapped about her and he took her for a swan
Oh and alas it was she Polly Vaughn
He ran up beside her and saw that it was she
Cried Polly oh Polly have I killed thee
He lifted up her head and saw that she was dead
And a fountain of tears for his true love he shed.
In the middle of the night Polly Vaughn did appear
Cried Jimmy oh Jimmy you must have no fear
Just tell them you were hunting when your trial day has come
And you won't be convicted for what you have done.
In the middle of the trial Polly Vaughn did appear
Crying Uncle oh Uncle Jimmy Randall must go clear
The lawyers and the judges stood around in a row
In the middle Polly Vaughn like some fountian of snow
For she'd her apron wrapped about her and they took her for a swan
Oh and alas it was she Polly Vaughn
Oh and alas it was she Polly Vaughn <start> The sun is sinking in the west
The cattle go down to the stream
The red wing settle in their nest
Its time for a cowboy to sing
Purple light in the canyon
That's where I long to be
With my three good companions
Just my rifle my pony and me
Whiporwill in the willow
Sings a sweet melody
Ridin' to Amarillo
Just my rifle my pony and me
No more cows to be ropin'
Nor more strays will I see
Round the bend she'll be waitin'
For my rifle my pony and me
For my rifle my pony and me <start> Pickin' up the pieces of my heart
Love to you is nothing but a fashion that stays in style util you change your mind
And when you think it's time to try a new love
You go and leave my broken heart behind
You've got me pickin' up the pieces I've been pickin' up the pieces
I'm just pickin' up the pieces of my broken heart
You've got me pickin' up the pieces I've been pickin' up the pieces
I'm just pickin' up the pieces of my heart
 piano 
Every time you leave me I start crying counting every minute we're apart
If you could only have consideration then I wouldn't have this broken heart
You've got me pickin' up... <start> His eyes were so stern
His hands were so strong
But his heart it was gentle
Even when you were wrong
He was a fighter as a boy
Best in the town
He worked every morning
In the mine he went down
So tell me Grandpa
Why do you look so sad
Tell me Grandpa
Why do you look so mad
The world it isn't bad to you
It put you on your path
Tell me Grandpa
Can I follow in your tracks
Now Grandma she stays smiling
When she looks in your eyes
She still sees that young boy
She's loved all her life
Down on the pull press
Workin' hard night and day
Still believing in family
In the old fashioned way
So tell me Grandpa
Why do you look so sad
Tell me Grandpa
Why do you look so mad
The world it isn't bad to you
It put you on your path
Tell me Grandpa
Can I follow in your tracks
Things that you taught me
Wood whistles you'd make
Well I'll always remember
Fishin' old Black Brooke lake
And old graceful can't talk now
But I know you can hear
My thoughts and my memories
You can find in my tears
So tell me Grandpa
Why did ya look so sad
Tell me Grandpa
Why did you look so mad
The world it wasn't bad to you
To keep you on your path
Tell me Grandpa
Can I follow in your tracks
Tell me Grandpa
Can I follow in your tracks <start> The thing about a breakup
Sometimes you just gotta break down
Coming off a great love
There's plenty of pain to pass around
Like a tip jar in a dive bar
Full of broken hearts
It's a lonely crowd
The thing about a breakup
Sometimes you just gotta break down
When the only thing you want is
The only thing that you can't have
When the part that you can't take is
Knowing you can't take it back
She's on the good side goodbye
On the right sight of free
And you're on the wrong end of a long night
On the left side of leavin'
Yeah
On the left side of leavin'
The thing about a last kiss
You never know that it's the last
Till they call the last call
And you're just drinking about the past
Like the bottom of the bottle
Knows how to get her back
The thing about a last kiss
You never know that it's the last
When the only thing you want is
The only thing that you can't have
When the part that you can't take is
Knowing you can't take it back
She's on the good side goodbye
On the right sight of free
And you're on the wrong end of a long night
On the left side of leavin'
Yeah
On the left side of leavin'
Stuck on the left side
You're on the drunk part of drinking
The can't stop part of thinking
The wide awake part of sleeping woah
You're on the broke part of breaking
The mistake part of making
You're on the cane part of shaking woah
When the only thing you want is
The only thing that you can't have
When the part that you can't take is
Knowing you can't take it back
She's on the good side goodbye
On the right sight of free
And you're on the wrong end of a long night
On the left side of leavin'
Yeah
On the left side of leavin' <start> I Don't Wanna Let Go

Album Love Songs
Road signs all show there's no cause for leaving
And the weeping wind knows that I'm broken and beaten
For my love has just hurt me like nothing I've known
How can I step aside from the feelings inside when I don't wanna let go
Let go when I know love will claim me again
Forget how I love her and my spirit would mend
But her memories like a fireside that warms me when cold
While it's burning I don't wanna let go
Sweet bitter dreams gather gently inside me
As I roll with the earth finding nothing to hide me
For my love was my shelter my shore and my home
How can time repay what I gave away
when I don't wanna let go <start> my baby's in the sky
my baby's in the river
my baby's in the old stone wall
in the old stone wall
my baby packed a trunk
with more than he could carry
more than he could carry down the old dirt road
down the old dirt road
and there's a hole in the house where my baby boy lay
there's a hole in the house where my baby boy lay
there's a hole in the house where my baby boy lay
the morning still comes
my days are full of cleanin'
and the candles still burn as the sun goes down
but there's a hole in the house where my baby boy lay
there's a hole in the house where my baby boy lay
there's a hole in the house where my baby boy lay
baby boy lay your head
baby boy lay your head
baby boy lay your head down
there's a hole in the house where my baby boy lay
there's a hole in the house where my baby boy lay
there's a hole in the house where my baby boy lay
baby boy lay
baby boy lay
baby boy lay <start> His pulpit's a corner at th and Main
His grip on the gospel is his one claim to fame
He hurls fire and brimstone at the cars passin' by
He offers salvation from the savior on high
His khakis are tattered he ain't bathed in weeks
His bouts with the bottle show up on his cheeks
He looks like a scarecrow a sight to behold
While he works for the shepherd bringin' lambs to the fold
He points to the Bible he holds in his hand
Says I'm proof that the good Lord can save any man
Son it ain't what you're drivin' or the clothes that you wear
Material possessions won't matter up there
Someday in heaven with the angels I'll sing
And these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king
He's fightin' a fever in spite of the chills
He pulls up his collar and speaks of God's will
His body is weakened but his faith is still strong
He's filled with conviction for the mission he's on
'Cause a mansion is waitin' he'll be homeless no more
And his words will still echo from that far distant shore
Son it ain't what you're drivin' or the clothes that you wear
Material possessions won't matter up there
Someday in heaven with the angels I'll sing
And these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king <start> If your paycheck depends on the weather and the clock

' Stallion Music
Day after day and for hour upon precious hour
I've held you and marveled at love that stayed fresh as a flower
From daylights to nightfall through sunlight and rainfall
Our spark hasn't once lost its glow
My arms have entwined you but never confined you
I'd die if you left but I want you to feel free to go
Feel free to go if my love ever feels like a chain around your heart
Stay cause you want me not cause you feel like you're tied
I love you I need you a love that so few people know
I want you to stay but I want you to feel free to go
If we should ever come to the forks in the road you go your way
And never look back in regret that you hurt me in some way
For right now if the sun stopped and all of the fond stop
My cup would still overflow
For you've been a treasure beyond any measure
I'd die if you left but I want you to feel free to go
Feel free to go... <start> Daylight has found me here again
You can ask me anything but where I've been
Things that used to matter seem so small
When you're looking for a soft place to fall
Don't misunderstand me baby please
I didn't mean to bring back memories
You should know the reason why I called
I was looking for a soft place to fall
Looking for a soft place
Nothing more than a small taste
Of a love that ended long ago
Looking for a place to hide
A warm bed on a cold night
I didn't mean to hurt you
No no no
Looking out your window at the dawn
Baby when you wake up I'll be gone
You're the one who taught me after all
How to find a soft place to fall <start> Oh my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street I feel a trembling in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time makes my heart skip a beat
Well I did a double take the day I met you
My heart turned a flip as I stood next to you
And I knew right there I never could forget you
For you are my every dream come true
And my heart skips a beat...
You came into my life without a warning
And you turned my cloudy skies from grey to blue
You're my sunshine that comes up every morning
Yes you are my every dream come true
And my heart skips a beat... <start> 
Oh the sun's gonna shine in my life once more
Love's gonna live here again
Thing's are gonna be the way they were before
Love's gonna live here again
Love's gonna live here
Love's gonna live here
Love's gonna live here again
No more loneliness
Only happiness
Love's gonna live here again
I hear bells a ringing
I hear birds a singing
Love's gonna live here again
I hear bees a humming
And I know the days a coming
Love's gonna live here again <start> She's gone again it's not fair
And what makes it even worse is I still care
She's gone again who knows why
She never said a word about goodbye
My friends used to say she's not the kind who'll settle down
Now they can say I told you so all over town
She promised me we'd fool my friends
But I'm the only we fooled she's gone again
My friends used to say...
But I'm the only we fooled she's gone again <start> Writer Dorothy Jo Hope

Yes I see God where the mountains reach the sky
And I see God when the eagle starts to fly
I see God in a little baby's smile I see God and he makes my life worthwhile
Yes I see God when the bridegroom meets his bride
I see God in a father's loving eyes
I see God when a mother starts to cry I see God in a love that never dies
 where the people meet to pray  in the things they do and
say
 when the little children play
I see God and I know he's near all way
I see God yes I see God <start> I met a man at the airport
Going home cause his brother had died
I tried to soften his sorrow
He smiled at me and replied
We're all passin through
Do unto others as you'd have done to you
Do what you can
You're fellow man is travelin too
We're all passin through
I keep his words in my memory
They keep my heart from consent
It's a lesson for livin
I'd pass on to all that I meet
We're all passin through
Do unto others as you'd have done to you
Do what you can
You're fellow man is travelin too
We're all passin through
No one knows how long their journey may be
Its not how far but how well you've traveled
That god will see
The old man smiled and departed
Our brief encounter ended
He left the seeds of a memory
And words I'll never forget
We're all passin through
Do unto others as you'd have done to you
Do what you can
You're fellow man is travelin too
We're all passin through
We're all passin through
Do unto others as you'd have done to you
Do what you can
You're fellow man is travelin too
We're all passin through
We're all passin through
We're all passin through <start> Nobody thinks about that stuff like how tall
He might have been or how fast he could've run
They just stare as he rolls by all they see is a helpless kid
With no chance to live a life but If they only knew
He's got dreams of breaking ribbons in a hundred yard dash
Climbing up a snow capped mountain and planting his flag
He believes one day he'll stand up and walk away from that chair
He's got faith he's got hope and all his mamma's prayers
He's not jaded or bitter gonna leave the giving up for the quitters
The doctors say no way he'll walk he just smiles
And says 'I'm gonna prove you wrong'
Lots of falls and failed attempts his legs keep giving out
But his heart ain't giving in 'cause what they don't know
He's got dreams of breaking ribbons in a hundred yard dash
Pushing Earnhardt down the back stretch in a Daytona draft
He believes one day he'll stand up and walk away from that chair
He's got faith he's got hope and all his mamma's prayers
He's not jaded or bitter he's gonna leave the giving up for the quitters
He pulls himself up on the bars
And takes a long deep breath
Lifts his right foot off the mat
And with all that he has left
He takes a step one step
Toward his dream of breaking ribbons in a hundred yard dash
Going long for a touchdown with his buddies out back
He believes one day he'll stand up and walk away from that chair
He's got faith he's got hope and all his mamma's prayers
He's not jaded or bitter he's gonna leave the giving up for the quitters
He ain't no quitter <start> John Roy was a boy I knew
Since he was  and I was two
Grew up two little houses down from me
The only bad apples on our family tree
Kinda ripened and rottened in our puberty
Two kindred spirits bound by destiny
Well now I was smart but I lacked ambition
Johnny was wild with no inhibition
Was about like mixin' fire and gasoline
And he'd say
Hey Romeo let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls a couple real hillbillies
Got a pocket full of cash and that old Ford truck
Fuzzy cat hangin' from the mirror for luck
Said don't you know all those little browneyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world
Long around our tenth year
We found two airplane tickets to the hell outta here
Got scholarships to some small town school in Texas
We learned to drink Sangrias 'til the dawn's early light
Eat eggs Ranchero's and throw up all night
And tell those daddy's girls we were majorin' in the rodeo
Aw but my favorite memory of school that fall
Was the night John Roy came runnin' down in the hall
Wearin' nothing but cowboy boots and a big sombrero
And he was yellin'
Hey Romeo let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls a couple real hillbillies
Got a pocket full of cash and that old Ford truck
Fuzzy cat hangin' from the mirror for luck
Said don't you know all those little browneyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world
And I say we had a little change in plans
Like when Paul McCartney got busted in Japan
And I said we got waylaid when we set foot on Mexican soil
You see the borderman guard with a fu manchu mustach
Kinda stumbled on John's pocketful of American cash
He said doin' a little funny business in Mexico Amigo
But all I could think about was savin' my own tail
When he metioned  years in a Mexican jail
So I pointed at John Roy and said
It's all his now please let me go I mean it was your idea genius
I was just layin' there in bed when you said
Hey Romeo let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls a couple real hillbillies
Got a pocket full of cash and that old Ford truck
Fuzzy cat hangin' from the mirror for luck
Said don't you know all those little browneyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world
Ah we're still best friends
Temporary cell mates
Whoo <start> I got the feeling when I
Looked at you tonight
That you've given up trying
Have you left it up to me
To be the one to keep our love from dying
If I could I'd take you in my arms
And bring us back to being close
But how can I hold you
If you're letting go
I won't pretend I've got the
Answers figured out
But I can't stop believing
Hanging on to what we got
Is still a better way to go
Than leaving
I'd do anything to make you stay
But I can't do it all alone
How can I hold you
If you're letting go
So please don't let this be the end
Hold out some hope that we can try again
I'd do anything to make you stay
But I can't do it all alone
How can I hold you
If you're letting go <start> If I have wounded any soul today
If I have caused one foot to go astray
If I have walked in my own willful way
Dear Lord forgive
If I have uttered idol words or fame
If I have turned aside from want or pain
Yes I offend some other through the strain
Dear Lord forgive
Forgive the sins I have confessed to Thee
Forgive the secret sins I do not see
Oh guide me love me and my keeper be
Dear Lord forgive <start> Keep that candle burnin' bright mama
I'll be kind of late tonight mama
There's a yellow moon above me mama
Shinin' on the one I love mama
Chorus
Burn that candle night and day
Burn that candle honey light our way
Keep that doorway open wide
Until we come slowly strollin' side by side
While that candle's shinin' high mama
I'll be with my sugar pie mama
We'll be comin' home you know and mama
Lookin' for that candle glowin' mama
Chorus
After we have had the wedding mama
To that candle we'll be headin' mama
So before we're winin' and dinin' mama
Keep that candle light ashinin' mama
Chorus x  <start> Don't mind the teardrops on the roses that I sent you
I didn't mean to show my broken heart this way
No matter what you do you'll never lose my love dear
As far as I'm concerned you're in my heart to stay
And if the teardrops make the red red roses fade and fall apart
Throw aside the broken petals like you threw away my heart
Don't mind the teardrops on the roses that I sent you
I didn't mean to show my broken heart this way
 steel 
You'll find a card among the roses that I sent you
Saying love like ours should never die and I'll be true
Don't mind the teardrops on the roses that I sent you
I didn't mean to show my broken heart this way <start> When you're deep in desperation filled with panic frustration
Sinking low in the depths of despair
When the world seem out to hurt you when your so call friends desert you
Reach for me little darling I'll be there
Let me put my arms around you let me hold you closer to me
Let me kiss away your troubles darling you can depend on me
When you wake in the morning and without any warning
You find that your whole world is disappeared
Suddenly you are facin' that most helpless situation
Reach for me little darling I'll be there
Let me put my arms...
Darling you can depend on me <start> You say you need someone to love
But when will you learn
Whatever's done in this world
Is still gonna turn
Chorus
Oh down comes the night just another forever
How long
How long 'till you see that we're in this together
How long how long
If you weren't so far away
So far from here
I'd make your tears go away
And make you see clear
Oh you'd see a night when two hearts would surrender
How long
I don't want you to be the one I remember
How long how long
Though time goes by in the blink of an eye
It's passed over you
There's no time to hide won't you stand by my side
I'm asking you oh
Chorus
You say you need someone to love
But when will you learn
You say you need someone to love <start> For years we fought the night
With pale and ghostly flames
Some still dream of light
So the sun will rise again
We'll cure our need for wrongs
In cool and measured crime
We'll learn to drift in palm
From our hearts and from our minds
Let us not be faithless
You will meet our needs
A good and gracious wordless
Will lamp unto our feet
For years we've closed our eyes
While rust on reason grows
Feed and clothe our lies
In our hearts we know yeah we know
Wisdom lends us all
Cool and steady hand
Steel pressed to my palm
Doesn't make me more a man
So courage for the givers
Do what must be done
To deal out truth and justice
With swift and sober guns
For years you met our thirst
Still deserts we have roamed
We'll be done with dust and dirt
When the ocean calls us home
And fall into the arms
Of a cool and sweet embrace
And under stars and waving palms
Shed our sin like snakes
But time will cease to stalk us
Death will be undone
We'll shine with the light of
A thousand blazing suns
Time will cease to stalk us
Death will be undone
We'll shine with the light of
A thousand blazing suns <start> You got your hair down
You got that look in your eye
That says come here and get me boy
Lay me down and love me just right yeah
Ain't goin' no where
I got a bottle of wine
I got nothin' but time on my hands
And I'm gonna be your man tonight ah yes I am
I can't imagine doin' nothin but what I'm doin'
Just layin' round tangled up with you
We got our buzz on sippin' on a little something
I need your lovin'
Just keep them kisses comin'
It's been a long week
I've been missin' me some you
All I wanna do is get your lips on mine
Girl if you only knew hey
I can't imagine doin' nothin' but what I'm doin'
Just layin' round tangled up with you
We got our buzz on sippin' on a little something
I need your lovin'
Just keep them kisses comin'
Yeah keep 'em comin' all night
Don't stop killin' me baby
Don't stop drivin' me crazy
I swear there's honey on your lips
Baby give me one more long slow kiss
I can't imagine doin' nothin' but what I'm doin'
Just layin' round tangled up with you
We got our buzz on sippin' on a little something
I need your lovin'
Just keep them kisses comin'
Oh keep 'em comin' all night hey <start> We're far apart but our hearts're holding hands
It's lonely just to sit here by myself each night
Not knowing when I'll ever get to hold you tight
Oh yes I have temptations and sometimes it's pretty rough
But temptation's never strong as our sweet love
Cause our hearts are holding hands across the miles
Even though we're lonely we can smile
Cause I know you're my woman
And I know you're my man
We're far apart but our hearts are holding hands
Today a stranger looked my way and flashed his gold
And said he'd buy me all the treasures I could hold
But I took out your last letter that said you love me so
And there I found the strength to tell him no <start> I was born one mornin'
The rain apourin' down
Heard my mammy say to my pappy
Let's call him John Henry Brown.
Chorus
Walk on boy walk on down the road
Ain't nobody in this whole wide world
Agonna help you carry your load.
I left my mammy and pappy
Just about the age of ten
Lord I got me a job aworkin' on the levee
Totin' water for the hard workin' men.
Chorus
One day my pappy told me
Some advice I wanna give to you
Son find a good woman be good to her
An' she's gonna be good to you.
Chorus
If anyone should ever ask you
Just who is that fella Brown
You can tell him I'm the boy
Who left his hammer smokin'
Where he beat that steam drill down.
Chorus
Walk on boy walk on down the road
There ain't nobody in this whole wide world
Agonna help you carry your load.
Walk on boy walk on boy
Walk on boy. <start> THE WISDOM OF A FOOL
WRITERS ROY ALFRED ABNER SILVER
If you're lucky enough
To have someone who loves you
Then be glad that you got
Someone who loves you
Cold lips that were warm
Can grow cool
Listen to the wisdom of a fool
When you take his poor heart
And you do something to it
And you think to yourself
Why did I do it
You may find that the
World can be cruel
Listen to the wisdom of a fool
Now I had a love
Just the same as you
And I was a fool
Not to see
But you still have time to say
Your love him
I'm afraid it's too late for me
So go back to the arms
That you know will be waiting
Hold him close in your arms
And be glad that he's waiting
You'll be happy
Believe me if you'll
Only listen to the wisdom of a fool
Only listen to the wisdom of a fool <start> First I was love then I came to be
I had a heart inside of me
And though my heart was working I found
Still there was something it had not found
So I went away hoping to see
Maybe I'd find what's missing in me
Knowing so well but not knowing why
If I didn't find this something I'd die
And then I came to where I had been
I knew the first was still not the end
What I had left was not what I found
Because there was you because there I found
First I was love then I came to be
I had a heart inside of me
And though me heart is still part of me
You gave my heart its reason to be <start> Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday
Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh I yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm <start> You're walking dately and when you hold me this way
Something tells me you're more than a friend cause I can hear music play
Maybe in the midnight hours a miracle mighty covers
You just might fall in love with me and hear the song that you've never heard
You'll hear the music of love I'll sing it to you every morning and night
As long as I'm living you'll hear the music of love coming out of your heart
You'll know I could it play
And you'll know that I'm in it for you love me and you love
And the music you'll hear with your heart don't you hear it's the music of love
We were never strangers I knew I'd meet you someday
I knew I'd find somebody like you and now you won't get away
Can't you feel our hearts beat in twopart harmony
All through the night the music you'll hear is love's old melody
You'll hear the music of love...
It's the music of love it's the music of love the music of love <start> In Canaan's land I'm on my way where the soul never dies
My darkest night will turn to day where the soul never dies
No sad farewell no tear dimmed eyes where all his love and the soul never dies
A rose is blooming there for me where the soul never dies
And I will spend eternity where the soul never dies
No sad farewell no tear dimmed eyes where all is loved and the soul never dies
A love light pinks across the throne where the soul never dies
It shines to light the shores of home where the soul never dies
No sad farewell no tear dimmed eyes where all his love and the soul never dies <start> I love it when we're at a party in a downtown crowd
Oh but I can hear you call me baby with the music up loud
Red wine good times no I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's night life tonight that I I want you to myself
And tonight I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh woah and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
I wanna feel it like a kick drum beating faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer my head on your shoulder baby we won't beat the song
We'll make a fallen star wish one more slow kiss what are we waiting on
And tonight I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
I wanna feel it like a kick drum beating faster in your chest
And tonight I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A river rolling in the background underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
And we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat <start> Pointless drinking
Where does it end where to begin
Who are you friends who are you foes
You'll never know as long as you go
Pointless drinking
Till it seems like they're all speaking poorly in Spanish
Who do you wish would totally vanish
And all you can do
I'm not an actor but I act like I am
I really am awful but I act like I'm not
Pretending my days hold the value of gold
But they only hold one thing and it's all that I've got
Pointless drinking
Keeping my healthy dose of resentment
Keeping me waking with an empty repentance
Keeping me broke broke as a joke
Pointless drinking
Took all the days that I should have felt young
Took all the joy from the songs I have sung
Took me awhile took me awhile
Well I'm not a hater I love you all so
But I look at myself and I don't really know
Can I dig myself out of the wreck of my past
Will I ever unharden and stop showing my ass
Will those eternal bartenders ever stop filling this halfempty glass
Pointless drinking
Hate the effect even more hate the cause
Hate to admit that I'm tragically flawed
I would keep going but let's pause for the cause
Pointless drinking
Why do you do it you always go through it
You drink to forget all the times you blew it
Think everyone knows think everyone cares
Pointless drinking
Keeping you drunk on your dreams of great heights
From the bottom to the top back down overnight
You know it's not right you know it's not right
Pointless drinking
It's just the one thing you're overachieving
Feels like you never will stop believing
That you'll never win you'll never win <start> And now the grand old opera theater proudly presents
a special holiday edition of the Adventures of the Kung Pao Buckaroos
Well it's a Kung Pao Buckaroo Holiday
Whatever you do watch what you say
If you're easily offended well that's okay
It's a completely nonoffensive and politically correct holiday
We catch up with our three cowboys one cold
December night huddled around the camp fire.
How 'bout we sing some holiday songs
Yeah hey George you wanna lead us off
Yeah I got one.
Oh Chribiipmas tree oh Chribiipmas tree how lovely are thou branched
Why am I getting blipped again
Haven't you heard guys You can't say Chribiipmas you gotta say Holiday
I can't say Chribiipmas
No you might offend somebody.
Who is offended by Chribiipmas
You know you might offend the biiiip and the biiiip and the atheists.
What
Time to politically correct.
I'll lead this off.
On the first day of Chribiipmas my true love said to me
Jimmy are you listening
What
You can't say Chribiipmas.
Why not
You can say biiiip on the last record.
Why can't I say Chribiipmas
I didn't make the rules.
Hey listen guys it's not that difficult
all you gotta do is change Chribiipmas to Holiday.
You know instead of saying white Chribiipmas you say
I'm dreaming of a whibiiip Holiday.
Why did I get blipped
You've got to say Caucasian.
So I have to sing I'm dreaming of a Caucasian holiday
Sure that won't offend anybody.
Well it's a Kung Pao Buckaroo Holiday
Whatever you do watch what you say
If you're easily offended well that's okay
Why do these people have to feel that way
How come they get offended so easily
It's a completely nonoffensive and politically correct holiday
I'm just trying to come up with a song here.
Let's sing one together everybody ready George
Ready.
Bill your ready
I'm ready.
Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy

Oh come on just try.
We three kings of Asia are
That sounds like horse biiiip
Oh lord okay. How 'bout Little Drummer boy
Nope that offends short people.
And you can't say drummer 'cause that will offend real musicians.
How 'bout little town of meddle hell.
What's this with all the short jokes
Hey how 'bout we do Silent Night
No it'll offend people who's hard to hear and afraid of the dark.
What did he say about a shark
Shark
This happens every year.
Well it's a Kung Pao Buckaroo Holiday
Whatever you do watch what you say
If you're easily offended well that's okay
It's a completely nonoffensive and politically correct holiday.
Hohoho
No.
I can't say ho
No you might offend some women.
So basically we can't sing anything
I think that a bunch of bull biiiip.
Softer George it's more effective.
I think that a bunch of bull biiiip.
You now what I don't care who we offend
I'm gonna sing Chribiipmas carols if I wanna sing Chribiipmas carols.
Louder man it's more effective.
I don't care who we offend

Me too.
We wish you a merry Chribiipmas we wish you a merry Chribiipmas
we wish you a merry Chribiipmas and a happy nebiip year.
We can't say new it'll offend the old folks.
And you never wanna offend them. <start> Plaisir d'amour
Ne dure qu'un moment
Chagrin d'amour dure
Toute la vie
Joys of love
Are but a moment long
Pain of love endures
The whole life long <start> You ask how much I need you
Must I explain
I need you oh my darling
Like roses need rain
You ask how long I'll love you
I'll tell you true
Until the twelfth of never I'll still be loving you
Hold me close
Never let me go
Hold me close
Melt my heart like April snow
I'll love you 'till the blue bells forget to bloom
I'll love you 'till the clover has lost its perfume
I'll love you 'till the poets run out of rhyme <start> Every time that someone walks in
She turns around to see if it's him
She checks her watch by the clock
I can't count the times he's stood her up
And one's too much
Chorus
How could anybody break a heart like hers
I can't stand to watch her hurt
I would gladly take his place
If she'd just love me that way
He must not know what it's worth
I don't understand how anyone
Could break a heart like hers
She keeps saying he'll change someday
He wasn't always this way
She things he hung the moon and stars
But all he's done is string her along like this
It don't make sense
Chorus <start> So round so firm so fully packed that's my gal
So complete from front to back that's my pal
Toasted by the sun and I'm a son of a gun
If She don't make my five o'clock shadow come around at one
You can bet your boots I'd walk a mile through the snow
Just to see her tooth paste  smile they mentioned on the radio
If you don't think she's lot of fun just ask the man who owns one
So round so firm so fully packed that's my gal
 steel  guitar 
So round so firm so fully packed boy she's for me
She's just like a money back guarantee
Like a barfly goes for drink like the bobbysocks go for Frank
And just like Jesse James he go for money in the bank
From a head to foot she's a perfect size she's a whiz
But she wears a fortyfive gun that is
She's got the look that's so impressin' she's got the pause that's so refreshin
So round so firm so fully packed that's my gal <start> The words of her promise the flame of her faith
And the love that would never drift away
Where did they go Lord where did they go
Somehow forever slipped out of my hands and my dreams ran away with the wind
Where did they go Lord where did they go
Sometimes I wish I had left her for another
But Lord she just walked off all alone
The heart that's within me isn't bitter it's just empty
And bewildered because her love has gone
Oh the passion I trusted the truth that I leaned on
And the hope that would forever keep me strong
I cry out my questions but the answers are gone
Where did they go Lord where did they go
Oh where did they go Lord where did they go <start> I met her out in Oklahoma down where the old Red River flows
I vowed my love to her forever she was my sweet sweet Rosie Jones
We walked alone down by the river just as the sun was sinking low
And in her eyes I saw big trouble like the muddy waters down below
Her lips were soft and sweet as honey her hair was bright as yellow as gold
Her cheeks were red as summer roses she was my sweet sweet Rosie Jones
And then one day a tall dark stranger with hair as black as winter coal
Rode into town as night was falling and there he met my Rosie Jones
I woke next morning just after sunup to find a note from my Rosie's hand
And it read I'd rather die than ever hurt you but I'm in love with that tall dark man
So now I walk alone down by the river where my sweet Rosie used to stroll
And soon I'm gonna join those deep dark waters for I can't live without Rosie Jones
Her lips were soft... <start> Cancel tomorrow I need no more time
I've wasted our words running you through my mind
You'll love me forever not counting today
So cancel tomorrow or it will just be in my way
You promised me true love that never would die
You promised no heartaches no hurt or goodbyes
But now it's all over what else can I say
But cancel tomorrow or it will be just like today
Cancel tomorrow <start> She was my friend when I needed a friend
He was a man who said our love would never end
When things went wrong she'd tell us both to try again
That's what friends are for that's what friends are for
And there were times when she was feeling down
One of us would always come around
And try to share some other happiness we found
That's what friends are for that's what friends are for
I suppose I should have seen what was happening to me
And I guess I should have known there wasn't love enough for three
And now there's only me
So I'm alone like I never thought I'd be
I trusted her just as far as I could see
And she stole his love away from me
If that's what friends are for
I don't need them anymore <start> The cold tonight seems more anxious to talk
Than he has seemed in nights before
Skinless face and yellow heart he
Hesitates and I wait
All my stories are about the same things
I find so many beds for them
I find this package of tiny lamps
And it makes a firey ring
Right now is the reason I carry this jewel
Everywhere round my neck
I keep it close but still outside
This is my explanation
All my stories are about the same things
I find so many beds for them
I find this package of tiny lamps
And it makes a firey ring
A box of love and sex and reflection
Its got my face and hands
The lonely is yellow and old
Watch the cold around my bed
All my stories are about the same things
I find so many beds for them
I find this package of tiny lamps
And it makes a firey ring <start> Well it looks like you finally made the front page
You always did look good in white
And I hope you like the ring of your new name
The one you'll be given tonight
All of this is news to me
I wondered why you never called
I guess that's the way that it's meant to be
If you're gonna ride you gotta learn to fall
But where do I fit in the picture
Or do I really fit at all
Or have I become a fixture
On an old forgotten wall
Well it looks like I finally made the front page
You know you always said I would
And things are well here in room twenty eight
God I hope you're doing good
There's a picture in my wallet
That I look at sometimes
It sends chills through my bones
A long lost love or whatever you want to call it
Oh but it left me all alone
But where do I fit in the picture
Or do I really fit at all
Or have I become a fixture
On an old forgotten wall
On an old forgotten wall <start> My older brother Tommy was a lineman rest his soul
His job was hanging hot wire on them highline power poles
Every morning bright and early he'd climb way up in the sky
And I never understood it so one day I asked him why
He said it pays big money and man I'm into that
It pays big money of you're willing to take a chance
Let me tell you something sonny you ought to see my bank account
It pays big money but he sure can't spend it now
Well my late uncle Charlie was this demolition hound
He'd travel across the country blowing buildings to the ground
He carried a case of dynamite seemed everywhere he went
He smoked them big long cigars and he'd wink at you and grin
He said it pays big money and man I'm into that
It pays big money of you're willing to take a chance
Let me tell you something sonny you ought to see my bank account
It pays big money but he sure can't spend it now
Well now the moral of this story boys is don't go getting yourself killed
Be nice to your rich relatives they just might put you in their will
That pays big money and we're all into that
It pays big money and big money's where it's at
Let me tell you something sonny you ought to see my bank account
It pays big money and we're rolling in it now
It pays big money having foolish kin
It pays big money guess I owe it all to them
Let me show you something sonny take a look at this bank account
It pays big money let's all spend some of it now <start> I was setting up for a gig
In this little country bar
This old boy in the corner watched me
Tune up my guitar
He said What kinda music do you play hoss
I play some myself
He said I sure hope it's country
These days it's hard for me to tell
You can talk to me about tractors
Cowboy boots and pickup trucks
Ol' cane poles and dirt roads
And spittin' Skoal in a Dixie cup
You can tell me about your Grandpa
And how he turned you onto Hank
If you gotta tell me how country you are
You probably ain't
He said Country is a way of life
That's almost gone
It's more than the clothes you wear
Or how you sing a song
It's about being honest
And working hard
Looking someone in the eye
Being who you say you are
You can talk to me about tractors
Cowboy boots and pickup trucks
Ol' cane poles and dirt roads
And spittin' Skoal in a Dixie cup
You can tell me all about your Grandpa
And how he turned you onto Hank
If you gotta tell me how country you are
You probably ain't
You can tell me all about your Grandpa
And how he turned you onto Hank
But if you gotta tell me how country you are
You probably ain't
If you gotta tell me how country you are
You know what you probably ain't hoss <start> Down at the cross where my Saviour died
down where for cleansing from sin I cried
There to my heart was the blood applied
Glory to His name
Chorus
Glory to His name glory to His name
There to my heart was the blood applied
Glory to His name
I am so woundrously saved from sin
Jesus so sweetly abides within
There at the cross where He took me in
Glory to His name
Chorus
Glory to His name glory to His name
There to my heart was the blood applied
Glory to His name
O precious fountain that saves from sin
I am so glad I have entered in
There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean
Glory to His name
Chorus
Glory to His name glory to His name
There to my heart was the blood applied
Glory to His name
Come to this fountain so rich and sweet
Cast your pour soul at the Saviour's feet
Plunge in today and be made complete
Glory to His name
Chorus
Glory to His name glory to His name
There to my heart was the blood applied
Glory to His name <start> Hey there weird kid in your hightop shoes
Sitting in the back of the class I was just like you
Always left out never fit in
Owning that path you're walking in
Mr. Misunderstood
Mr. Misunderstood
Now your buddies get their rocks off on Top  radio
But you love your daddy's vinyl oldtime rock and roll
Elvis Costello Ray Wylie Hubbard and think Jeff Tweedy
Is one bad mother
Mr. Misunderstood
Mr. Misunderstood
One day you'll lead the charge you'll lead the band
Guitar Hero with lightning hands
And the girls will like your tattoos and the veins in your arms
They'll be helpless to your musical charms
And they'll all hold up their hands
And they'll all wanna dance
Mr. Misunderstood
Mr. Misunderstood
First time I met Alabama Hannah I was skinny as a rail
Red hair tied up in a blue bandana
She was hotter than the devil's Hell
She turned me on to Back Porch Pickers Jackson Pollock and gin
Her daddy didn't trust my intentions
So he turned to his daddy's old fourten
I'm Mr. Misunderstood
Mr. Misunderstood
Had an axe to grind so off I went
Mad at the sun for coming up again
I lost religion found my soul in the blues
Rubbed the velvet off my blue suede shoes
Yeah everybody held up their hands
And every soul on Beale Street danced
With Mr. Misunderstood
Mr. Misunderstood
So I went with it like a colt on my Plymouth
Through the glass behind my rearview
Took a left when the world went right down th Avenue
Played with fire and I played on ledges
Every circus stage and county fair
They tried to file my points
Sand my edges and I just grew out my hair
I'm Mr. Misunderstood
I'm Mr. Misunderstood
They're standing in line chasing the buzz
Til the next big things and already was
A hell if they know what they're trying to find
If it ain't that same old beendone kind yeah
Gives the headscratchers fits
I wondered how in the hell they missed
A Mr. Misunderstood
Mr. Misunderstood
Hey there weird kid in your hightop shoes
Sitting in the back of the class I was just like you
Mr. Misunderstood 
Mr. Misunderstood 
Mr. Misunderstood 
Mr. Misunderstood 
Mr. Misunderstood 
I'm Mr. Misunderstood 



 <start> Take the ribbons from your hair shake it loose and let it fall
Laying soft against my skin like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side till the early morning light
All I'm taking is your time help me make it through the night
I don't care who's right or wrong I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow Lord tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone and tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone help me make it through the night
 strings 
And it's sad to be alone help me make it through the night
And it's sad to be alone help me make it through the night <start> You carry me along with you
Keep my spirit strong you do
Maybe I was meant to be
Under your lock and key
The hard times that I had
Really don't seem all that bad
Yesterday is long ago and far away
And I'm beginning to feel the years
But I'm going to be ok
As long as you're beside me along the way
Going to make it through the night
And into the morning light
There are things that I've said before
I don't mean them anymore
Yesterday is long ago and far away
And I'm beginning to feel the years
But I'm going to be ok
As long as you're beside me along the way
Going to make it through the night
And into the morning light
With angels by your side
The spirit's there to guide
I'm beginning to feel the years
But I'm going to be ok
As long as you're beside me along the way
Going to make it through the night
And into the morning light <start> I don't love you like I used to do but I'm afraid to tell you so
I've got half a mind to leave you but only half the heart to go
Words to tell you just don't come to me guess my courage is too slow
I've got half a mind to leave you but only half the heart to go
Now time may prove that you're not to blame but now's the time I need to know
I've got half a mind to leave you but only half the heart to go <start> Red dress spilled wine
Caught in a stupid fight
He's wrong she's right

Ring ring telephone
Act like I'm not home
Can't hear the tears cry

And the minutes turn to hours
And they're flying like a jet plane
And we'll make it right tomorrow
But tomorrow's not a sure thing
The clock don't stoooop ticking away
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
The clock don't stoooop ticking away
Away
Always hanging on the wall
No it don't care at all
It won't slow down it won't wait
The clock don't stoooop ticking away

Head's scared heart broke
Burned from a band of gold

Yeah yeah yeah

Clock don't stoooop ticking away <start> Oh the sound of the thing is not a ring
It's more like a pleasant purr
And the only sound I hear at night
Is the sound of my purring airconditioner
The air is pure and dehumidified
Thermostatically controlled
Now I have no desire to perspire
And that's how progress goes
But the sound of their singing thrilled me
As distantly but clearly it rang
Though I never saw their faces
And never knew their names
And the gentle breeze brought sweet dreams
Of sweethearts that I never saw
Who sang 'You Are My Sunshine'
In Newport Arkansas <start> As the music at the banquet
As the wine before the meal
As the firelight in the night
So are you to me
As the ruby in the setting
As the fruit upon the tree
As the wind blows over the plains
So are you to me
As the wind blows over the plains
So are you to me
So are you to me <start> Well it's always we ramble this river and I
All along your green valleys I work till I die
My land I'll defend with my life need it be
Cause my pastures of plenty must always be free
Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground
From the Grand Coulee Dam where the waters run down
Every state in this union us migrants have been
Lord we come with the dust and we go with the wind
California Arizona I harvest your crops
Then it's on up North to Oregon to gather your hogs
Take the beet from your ground cut the grapes from your vine
Just to place on your table your that light sparkling wine <start> Let me carry that old suitcase hon
And here's my hat to shade your pretty head from the sun
Let's keep moving down the road that has no end it seems
For a long time we've been dreaming California dreams
Where the sands're gold and blue the sea money grows from every tree
It's always there for you and me California dreams
This old road gets longer every mile
And honey I know this is no place for a woman with child
But soon we'll have someone to share our plans and our schemes
And our baby will be a part of California dreams
I should have known this would be too much for you
But I thank you honey for lovin' me enough to come along cause your love is so true
And it just won't be the same when I'll reach California's shining sea
Cause without you there beside me there's just no California dreams
Where the sands're gold...
California dreams California dreams <start> Wish that I was on old Rocky Top down in the Tennessee hills
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top ain't no telephone bills
Once I had a girl on Rocky Top part bear the other part cat
Wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop I still dream about that
Rocky Top you'll always be home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top Rocky Top Tennessee Rocky Top Tennessee
Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top lookin' for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top reckon they never will
Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top ground's too rocky by far
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top get their corn from a jar
Rocky Top you'll always be...
I've had years of cramped up city life trapped like a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a pity life can't be simple again
Rocky Top you'll always be... <start> Tis the season for generosity
A time to give and to receive
My Christmas list consists of just one sweet dream
I know what I want for Christmas this year
I hope my note got to Santa on time
I'm a little bit nervous
It's kind of a big thing I'm asking for
I don't know if I deserve it but boy if I get it
I'll never ask for anything more
It shines it's new
And it's the one wish that I wish would come true
This year for Christmas I just wanna be with you
We can build a little fire
We can sit and talk for hours
We'll just have fun
You can tell me what you did
Christmas morning as a kid
And we'll talk about all our Christmases to come
And if I hang a little mistletoe in every single doorway
I'm sure to get a kiss
And is it too much to ask for a snowman kind of snow
To complete this singular wish
It shines it's new
I know what I want and nothin' else will do
This year for Christmas I just want to be with you <start> I love you because you understand dear every single thing I try to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand dear
But most of all I love you cause you're you
No matter what the world may say about me
I know your love will always see me through
I love you because my heart is lighter every time you're walking by my side
I love you because the future's brighter the door to happiness you've opened wide
No matter what may be the style or seasons I know your heart will always be true
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons but most of all I love you cause you're you <start> Last night I was prepparing to go to a party
And on the rack with my suits I found the shirt that I'd worn
When I held her in my arms for the very last time
The shirt that I vowed I'd never wear again
As I took it from the rack all my dreams came racin' back
The faint perfume of sweet love filled the night
I could see her face again she kissed my lips as then
And I almost felt my arms around her tight
A shirt that even the Gods must envy
For its arms once encircled the dream that only heavens could bring
Against this shirt once beat that wonderful heart in the whole wide world
And forever each thread shall remind me of her
I rolled down I turned up sleeve and scaresly could believe
For I found a strand of her soft golden hair
I slowly took it down like a star from an angel's crown
I closed my eyes and softly said a prayer
Then I walked to the window sill my eyes began to fill
I thought I heard the soft wind call her name
And the shirt across my arm grew strangely soft and warm
As if I'd reached and held it to a flame
And there I stood hearin' only the beat of my own aching heart
Lost in the dreams of what might have been
And the shirt seemed as sorrowful as I and just as empty body and soul <start> Chorus
Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little lord Jesus laid down his sweet head
The stars in the sky look down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay
The cattle all glory the baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes
I love the Lord Jesus look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle till morning is ney.
Chorus
Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little lord Jesus laid down his sweet head
The stars in the sky look down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay. <start> I've got the blues those Nashville blues

Gonna stay right there with my pa and ma

i was just on my way out

so i made my way all over to the corner booth
in my sweetest voice i said would you care if i joined you
with a smile she said yes
it was love working in memphis tennessee it was meant to be
i could never have known that day she was 'bout to come my way
it was someone else's plan i guess
i fell in love right there in memphis
we stayed by the river in some town's house hotel sleep
and we made love all night long till we drifted off to sleep
i woke up in paradise
she laying there by my side
with the sound of wedding bells ringing in my mind
so i asked that morning
as we layed there in the sheets
i can't imagine a sweeter sound than the way she answered me
with a smile she said yes
it was love working in memphis tennessee it was meant to be
i could never have known that day she was 'bout to come my way
it was someone else's plan i guess
i fell in love right there in memphis
so i asked that morning

The bells that'll tingle all your troubles away
Everybody's waiting for the man with the bag
Christmas is here again
He's got a sleigh full it's not gonna stay full
Stuff that he's droppin' every stop of the way
Everybody's waiting for the man with the bag
Christmas is here again
He'll be here
With the answer to the prayers that you made through the year
You'll get yours
If you've done everything you should extra special good
He'll make this December the one you'll remember
The best and the merriest you ever did have
Everybody's waitin' for the man with the bag
Christmas is here again
He'll be here
With the answer to the prayers that you made through the year
You'll get yours
If you've done everything you should extra special good
He'll make this December the one you'll remember
The best and the merriest you ever did have
Everybody's waitin' they're all congregating
Waitin' for the man with the bag
Better watch out now <start> When God made woman I wonder sometimes
If it was a flower he had in mind when he made her
A touch as gentle as a butterfly
A kiss so sweet it could stop time forever
God gave man a chance to be
The kind of strength a woman needs
He was supposed to be the one to carry that load
But there she goes baby in her arms
World on her shoulders when her day starts
Working a job that don't pay much
But she thanks God it's enough
And there she is on her own two feet
He walked out but she's still got dreams
Tries to laugh when she feels like crying
Nobody'd blame her if she stopped trying
But she's got a heart that gives and gives
So you tell me who the strong one is
Tonight's the first night in a while
She put on her makeup wearing a smile she's going out
And everything was all planned out
But the fever that the baby's got now it's all shot down
She gives up what she wants to do
For what she has to that's what a momma does
She'll be there like she always is
When the sun comes up
And there she goes baby in her arms
World on her shoulders when her day starts
Working a job that don't pay much
But she thanks God it's enough
There she is on her own two feet
He walked out but she's still got dreams
Tries to laugh when she feels like crying
Nobody'd blame her if she stopped trying
But she's got a heart that gives and gives
So you tell me who the strong one is
And there she is on her own two feet
He walked out but she's still got dreams
Tries to laugh when she feels like crying
Nobody'd blame her if she stopped trying
But she got a heart that gives and gives
So you tell me who the strong one is
Yeah you tell me who the strong one is <start> Making believe that you still love me and it's leaving me alone and so blue
I'll always dream still I'll never own you making believe is all I can do
I can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love and you'll never be mine
Making believe I'll spend my lifetime loving you and making believe
 steel  guitar 
I can't hold you close darling when you're not with me
You're somebody's love and you'll never be mine
Making believe I'll spend my lifetime just loving you and making believe <start> You say you've found another another you love better
You say you're gonna leave me pack up and go
You don't want to hurt me but you've just gotta have him
And how will I take it you want to know
Well if you can live with it I can live without it
If you can face your conscience I can face my pride
If you can live with it I can live without it
Cause I did the only thing I could do baby I tried
Can you really take your rings off without feeling kinda dirty
Can you really kiss him while you're wearing my name
Can you run your fingers all across his body
Without missing me a little and feeling ashamed
If you can live with it <start> By David Allan Coe and F. Spears
Will you hurt me more
Than the pain of sharing her
With other lovers believers or deceivers
Well the answer can't be found
When I'm alone
So Rachel take me home
And make me feel like a man
I know I swore that I'd be faithful
But Rachel made me realize that happiness
Is something you can't share
With Tom Dick or Harry
The reason we got married
Was to know when you were needed
You'd be there
So now you know all about her
Now you want to act like she's the reason
You've been staying out at night
But honey I've been drinking'
And lately I've been thinking'
The way that we've been loving'
Just ain't right
Will you hurt me more
That the pain of sharing her
With other lovers believers or deceivers
Well the answer can't be found
When I'm alone
So Rachel take me home
And make me feel like a man
And the man you feel
I ain't half as real
As the man I used to be
They've took my pride and I had to fight
To keep my sanity
Under Rachel's wings. <start> Well I stayed up all night
I've been doing it for years
Sleep is not my friend 'cause dreams just feed my tears
So I laughed my way around
I've been everybody's girl
I drank for forgiveness till I drank up the world
Change
Nobody's here to hold me
Change
And the morning's cold and lonely
But I think I can change my life
Change
There's a light outside my window
Peepin' through the blinds
There's a life out there worth livin'
But there's nothing here to find
Just a book of people's numbers
That are just as scared as me
Dialing for a dimes worth
Of pain and company
Change
Nobody's here to hold me
Change
And the morning's cold and lonely
But I think I can change my life
Change
No matter where I turn
There's no escape I see
I'm just staring in this mirror
And that stranger can't be me
But I think I can change my life
You'll see a change in me
Well I'm sittin' in this room
With my cigarettes and wine
I'm out of all the other stuff
And now I'm running out of time
Change
Nobody's here to hold me
Change
I'm so cold and so lonely
But I think I can change my life
You'll see a change in me <start> Every day along about evening
When the sunlight's beginning to pale
I ride through the slumbering shadows
Along the Navajo Trail
When it's night and crickets are callin'
And coyotes are makin' a wail
I dream by a smoldering fire
Along the Navajo Trail
I love to lie and listen to the music
When the wind is strummin' a sagebrush guitar
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin'
It always finds me wishin' on a star
Well what a ya know it's mornin' already
There's the dawnin' so silver and pale
It's time to climb into my saddle
And ride the Navajo Trail
I love to lie and listen to the music
When the wind is strummin' a sagebrush guitar
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin'
It always finds me wishin' on a star
Well what a ya know it's mornin' already
There's the dawnin' so silver and pale 
It's time to climb into my saddle <start> Is ten o'clock in the morning
To early to drink beer
I don't know and I don't care.
When a girl walks by in a two piece
Is it impolite to stare
I don't know and I don't care.
I don't know what beach this is
I don't know what day this is
I don't know if I packed enough clothes to wear
And I don't care.
Hey man do you think those are real or you think there fake
You mean those Right there
Hell I don't know
And I don't care.
Do you want the blond or the brunette
Or the one with the long red hair
I don't know
And I don't care.
I don't know what her name is
I don't know where she learned to kiss
I don't know if that's her boyfriend over there
And I don't care.
Is four o'clock in the morning
To late to drink beer
I don't know but you know what
I don't care.
I don't know last time I ate
I don't know how I'm still awake
I don't know how long a man can live on beer.
Man I don't know where I left my phone
I don't know when we're going home
I don't know if I still got a job up there
And I don't care.
I don't care
I don't know
And I don't care. <start> Last night another held me in his arms a lover's moon was shining bright and clear
He whispered words of love so tenderly
But I couldn't say the words he longed to hear
I thought of you and things that might have been
I thought of you and it was useless to pretend
Oh when he asked me if I loved him too
I closed my eyes sweetheart and thought of you
Well as he held me tightly in his arms I tried to find the thrill that we once knew
It could have hurt to his heart if he had known that I was just pretending it was you
I thought of you <start> 
When I was a young man I used to dream of a maiden
With long soft hair flowing in the wind
Her laughing eyes and loving arms would follow
When I'd sail around the world and back again
And I'd ride down on a great white horse I'd bring the love she was longing for
I'd bring her laughter and sunny days
And on a great white horse I'd carry her away
Singing dumbdidedumbdumbdumbdidedumb
 and I don't wanna sail the seven seas
 and the only world I want is here with me
And we both ride on a great white horse we found the love we were longing for
 you're my April you're my May
Singing dumbdidedumbdumbdumbdidedumb
Singing dumbdidedumbdumbdumbdidedumb
Singing dumbdidedumbdumbdumbdidedumb <start> You know I feel most the time like a kite on a line
Tossed about no control any way the wind blows
Then I see you holding on
The string that runs me to you all that keeping me tied to
This world so long
Oh I'd be gone
So don't let me go
I might fly away
Come on talk me down
When the light turns to black when the weight on my back
Gets to much I start to bend can not straighten out again
I feel you there you lift me up
When I'm out on the ledge just one step from the edge
You take my hand
You understand
When no one else can get through
All I want to hear is you
Saving me saving me from myself <start> May the fruit of my toil be yours love may the food from my soil be yours love
And from this moment on may a love true and strong that lives on and on be yours love
May the sons that I raise be yours love may the comforts I praise be yours love
If I ever get weak may the love words I speak and the arms that I seek be yours love
May the Lord's shining grace be yours love may the happiest face be yours love
May the last fingertips that touch these two lips as life from me slips be yours love <start> I pay rent on a rundown place
There ain't no view but there's lots of space
In my heart
The heart that you own
I pay the rent
Pay it right on time
Baby I pay you every single dime
For my heart
The heart that you own
Used to be I could love here for free
Way back before you bought the property
Now I pay daily on what once was mine
Lord I probably owe you
For the tears that I cry
'Cause I pay rent on a rundown place
There ain't no view but there's lots of space
In my heart
The heart that you own
I struggle each night to find a new way
To pay what I owe
Just so I can stay
I ain't overdue
So you can't throw me out
I've loved here for years
Don't know where I'd go now <start>  is the number of my love
Even though it's been some time since he made fair to answer
'Cause he feints and fades from view like a fighter ducks a glove
Though i play the highway kind and he the china dancer
If i was afraid to break or bleed
I would find someone much easier to need
But when drifters' dreams come true and when push comes 'round to shove
 is the number of my love
 is the number i must call
When casey's at the bat and sleeping beauty slumbers
When the frost is on the dew and my teardrops freeze and fall
Till the world is frozen flat and the long night snows me under
On the icy nails of no return
We will strike the match and set the night to burn
'Cause when beauty wakes anew and when casey cracks the ball
 is the only number
I am not looking for no champion of my freedom
I am anything but anybody's foundling
Sometimes i feel like i am wandering an old balloon on broken string
A bubble in a baby's dream a lost and lonely buzzardling
A vulture beating creaky wings while angry storms go gathering around me
 is the number of my love
When the clouds are howlin rain and the sky is black as ashes
'Cause it's sunlight where we flew though the trail is cold above
And the raven quakes in vain while the lightning barks and flashes
Still the clouds will fade to gray cocoons
And spring the winken monarchs nodding neverblinken moons
When the crows come home to roost and the eagle weds the dove
 is the number of my love <start> I'm sittin' on the fender of someone else's truck
Drinkin' Old Crow Whiskey and hot Up
Out in the parkin' lot
You can hear the band playin'
Right through the walls
Ain't no cover charge
Ain't no last call
Out in the parkin' lot
Chorus
Yeah I love to see the neon dancin' on the gravel
And I love to hear the pickup trucks as they come unraveled
Some've given up
Some've given in
Seems like everybody's lookin' for a friend
Out in the parkin' lot
Whoops there's a couple
Who couldn't wait to get home
They're probably in love so let's leave them alone
Out in the parkin' lot
There's a couple of cowboys
Puttin' up their dukes
But there weren't much to it after both of 'em puked
Out in the parkin' lot
Chorus
Now the band is on the bus
And they're all loaded up to leave
But the drummer's got a girlfriend
And she's tuggin' on his sleeve
Out in the parkin' lot
Chorus
I'm sittin' on the fender of someone else's truck
Drinkin' Old Crow Whiskey and hot Up
Out in the parkin' lot <start> I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't by the same dear if you're not here with me
And when those blue snowflakes start falling 
That's when those blue memories start calling 
You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue blue blue Christmas
 think I'm felling better already 
You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue blue blue Christmas <start> You can have Charleston
The cobblestone streets
The steeples looking down
On the Battery
The Topsails and the Clydesdales
Pulling people all around
The ocean breeze and the live oak trees
God I'm gonna miss this town but
You can have Charleston
I'll pack up and leave
Maybe find a spot on the West Coast
Give you lots of room to breathe
With your new life and your new love
I won't get in your way
I'll just wish you well and try like hell
To smile and walk away from
My home my heart
Where I was born where I was raised
Where one day they're gonna take my body
And lay it in a grave
My soul don't wanna go
But it's got to be this way
It's gonna break my heart to say goodbye
But it'll kill me if I stay
You can have Charleston
It's really for the best
Girl it's your town now
Plus I could never rest
There're too many ghosts on this old coast
Too many memories
It's where we met and we fell in love
It's where you cut me deep and made me bleed
From time to time
I might be passing through
But I promise you
That's all I'll do
You can have Charleston
I'll take these broken dreams
Load 'em in up in a suitcase
And see where it leads
Take  until I get
A million miles away
Try and start over
In a brand new place <start> When Joseph was an old man an old man was he
He married Virgin Mary the Queen of Galilee
He married Virgin Mary the Queen of Galilee
Mary and Joseph walk through an orchid green
There were berries and cherries as thick as might be seen
There were berries and cherries as thick as might be seen
And Mary said to Joseph so meek and so mild
Joseph gather me some cherries for I am with child
Joseph gather me some cherries for I am with child
And Joe flew in anger in anger flew he
Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee
Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee
Then up spoke Baby Jesus from in Mary's womb
Bend down the tallest tree that my mother might have some
Bend down the tallest tree that my mother might have some
And bent down tallest branch till it touched Mary's hand
Cried she Oh look thou Joseph I have cherries by command
Cried she Oh look thou Joseph I have cherries by command <start> Yonder comes Willie the weeper
Saddest looking sight in all the town
Had a new love but couldn't keep her
Now Willie's crying heart is broken down
You should have seen the smiling face that Willie wore
The day he found the thrill of her embrace
For the first time in his whole life Willie fell in love
But I took the smile right off of Willie's face took his place
Yonder comes Willie the weeper
I put on the smiling face that Willie wore
And took her round for everyone to see
But she found someone else that she wanted more
Now Willis's smiling face laughs back at me look and see
I'm just like Willie the weeper
Saddest looking sight in all the town
Had a new love but couldn't keep her
Now mine and Willie's hearts are broken down <start> 
Rock in my shoe a rock in my shoe
Driving me crazy won't come loose
Rattle and shake blowing a fuse
Can't stop got a little rock in my shoe
When I was a baby long ago
Mama would rock me to and fro'
Daddy would play that rock and roll
Hooked me then and never let me go

Rock in my shoe a rock in my shoe
Driving me crazy won't come loose
Rattle and shake blowing a fuse
Can't stop got a little rock in my shoe
Couldn't sit still when I was in school
Didn't care much about the golden rule
They called me a rebel called me a fool
They couldn't see I had a little rock in my shoe

Rock in my shoe a rock in my shoe
Driving me crazy won't come loose
Rattle and shake blowing a fuse
Can't stop got a little rock in my shoe
Now if you got troubles you got some blues
You think the world's coming down on you
Don't worry honey here's some news
All you need is a little rock in your shoe

Rock in my shoe a rock in my shoe
Driving me crazy won't come loose
Rattle and shake blowing a fuse
Can't stop got a little rock in my shoe <start> One night when the moon was bright on the moonlit glade
That is where I found my little Cherokee maiden
The memory of that night of love is lingering here
And I know I never will forget
My little Cherokee maiden I love her so
Even though we're far apart
I know I'll never be trading my love for her
For anybody else's heart
Someday I'll make a trip back to that Cherokee strip
And I'll carry her away with me
And straight as an arrow flies we'll ride to Paradise
My sweet little chickadee my little Cherokee maiden and me
My little Cherokee maiden I love her so
Even though we're far apart
I know I'll never be trading my love for her
For anybody else's heart <start> There's a long line of mourners comin' down our little street
Their fancy cars are such a sight to see
They're all of your rich friends who knew you in the city
And now they finally brought you on to me
When you left you told me someday you'd be returning
In a fancy car for all the town to see
Now everyone is watching you finally got your dream
You're riding in that long black limousine
The papers told of how you lost your life the party and the fatal crash that night
The race upon the highway the curve you didn't see
And now you're in that long black limousine
Through tear dimmed eyes I watch as you ride by
The chauffer at the wheel dressed up so fine
I'll never love another my heart and all my dreams
Are with you in that long black limousine hmm hmm <start> Under the influence of love
She knew I knew that she was out to get me but I just close my eyes let it be
Now she walks by me like she never met me I didn't even make a memory
For I was under the influence of love I wonder now what I was thinking of
Yes I was so in love I let her hurt me though I knew better
Under the influence of love
Why did I let her do me like she done me why can't I get that woman off my mind
Although I know she never truly loved me I wish she break my heart just one time
For I was under the influence of love <start> When life's a picture of black and white
With so much there that isn't tried
A gentle smile and you begin
To change the scene and color in
And leaden weights turn into wings
How do you do those things
So many voices but nothing said
It's like a drum in my head
Your eyes are singing without words
The sweetest things I've ever heard
Instead of drums I am hearing strings
How do you do those things
How do you take my heart and turn it over
Where do you get the power you possess
Making my concrete world a field of clover
Turning my losing run into success
So much confusion So many tears
The sound of sadness in my ears
Just when I think I cannot cope
You lift my heart and give me hope
From troubled waters healing springs
How do you do those things
How do you do those things <start> So this is love this is what it feels like
To need someone more than life
I never knew it could be this passionate so intense
I've got so much to lose I can't even think about it
Chorus
I don't want to experience how it would feel
To live one second without you here
Left without your kisses wanting more
Not to hear your heartbeat like before
What would I do where would I go
If you were gone and I had to move on
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I had a dream someone up above us
Called your name in the name of love
And I cried as heaven took you on angel's wings
I woke up and screamed
God in heaven above don't take her from me
Chorus
And when we touch let's make love like it was our first and last time
And when we part cross your heart and swear on love it's not goodbye
Chorus <start> Faded photographs the feelings all come back
Even now some times you feel so near
And I still see your face like it was yeasterday
Its strange how the days turned into years
Years of hanging on the dreams are already gone
Dreams of wishing you were here
After all this time youd think I wouldn't cry
Its just that I still love you after all theses years
Night time gentaly falls another day is gone
I turn around to find your still not here
I leave the hall light on
in case you come back home
But I've been saying that for years
Years of hanging on to dreams are already gone
Its a wishing you were here
After all this time youd think I wouldn't cry
Its just that I still love you after all theses years
After all theses years <start> Rode into town and only eighteen
My girl beside me and a baby in a car seat
Everybody called me crazy
That was fine as long as I knew
She believed
Not a nickel to our name
Cheap motel east side of town just south of Main
Songs I wrote for change
And one day I'd be headlining the stage
She gives me strength
When mine's all gone
She always keeps me hanging on
When I feel I've lost my way
She leads me home
She don't know how much I need her
A beautiful believer
I just got the news today
You know that song I wrote for you has made its way
Then oh so much has changed
You know the one thing that has always stayed the same
She gives me strength
When mine's all gone
She always keeps me hanging on
When I feel I've lost my way
She leads me home
She don't know how much I need her
A beautiful believer
Beautiful believer
Every time I doubt myself
Before I even ask for help
She's right there next to me
A beautiful believer
Every night I close my eyes
Just knowing that she's by my side
That's all I really need
She gives me strength
When mine's all gone
She always keeps me hanging on
When I feel I've lost my way
She leads me home
She don't know how much I need her
A beautiful believer
She don't know how much I need her
A beautiful believer <start> I feel the raindrops drummin'
As I march against the wind
I knew the storm was comin'
But I'm not throwin' my towel in
It's not rainin' on my parade
My tired heart's still beatin'
No it's not given up
Right pain is pourin'
But I'm headed for the sun
It's not rainin' on my parade
My hope is my umbrella
My will's a silver rainbow's clouds
My future is my shelter
When the thunder's crashin' loud
The wind I'll weather the water I'll wade
It's not rainin' on my parade
I'm parading in the rain
My heart is all but breakin'
But I'm not dwellin' on the past
Inside I'm celebrating
All the great times that we had
And it's not rainin' on my paradeyeah
I know the right one's out there
Who's got a heart that's true
I know to keep on marchin'
Till love comes shinin' through
It's not rainin' 
On my parade
My hope is my umberella
My will's a silver rainbow's clouds
My future is my shelter
When the thunder's crashin' loud
The wind I'll weather the water I'll wade
It's not rainin' on my parade
I'm parading in the rain
My hope  is my umbrella
My will's  a silver rainbow's clouds
My future is my shelter 
When the thunder's crashin' loud
The wind I'll weather the water I'll wade
It's not rainin' on the parade
I'm parading in the rain
I'm parading in the rain <start> The grey clouds have departed
The stars light up the night
Now I can see through darkness
The river shines with life
I've waded through the water
My soul is comin' clean
I've held my breath forever
But now it's time to breathe
There's nothing like forgiveness
To resurrect a soul
Better to give than get it
I've been forgiven so I'm lettin' you know oh
Nobody should be less than whole
So many broken people
Their hearts forget to beat
Grown numb no one's forgiven
Go on forgive yourself
Go on forgive yourself
'Cause there's nothing like forgiveness
To resurrect a soul
Better to give than get it
I've been forgiven so I'm lettin' you know oh
Nobody should be less than whole
Oh yeah ooh yeah
There's nothing like forgiveness
Oh to resurrect a soul
Better to give it yeah than it is to get it
Oh I've been forgiven so I should know
I've been forgiven so I should know
I've been forgiven so I should know
Nobody should be less than whole
There's nothing like forgiveness
To resurrect a soul
Better to give it yeah then it is to get it
Give it I've been forgiven so I'm lettin' you know
Nobody nobody should be less than whole  <start> Old Joe Clark's a fine old man
Tell you the reason why
He keeps good liquor 'round his house
Good old Rock and Rye
Fare ye well Old Joe Clark
Fare ye well I say
Fare ye well Old Joe Clark
I'm a going away
Old Joe Clark the preacher's son
Preached all over the pain
The only text he ever knew
Was High low Jack and the game
Old Joe Clark had a mule
His name was Morgan Brown
And every tooth in that mule's head
Was sixteen inches around
Old Joe Clark had a yellow cat
She would neither sing or pray
She stuck her head in the buttermilk jar
And washed her sins away
Old Joe Clark had a house
Fifteen stories high
And every story in that house
Was filled with chicken pie
I went down to Old Joe's house
He invited me to supper
I stumped my toe on the table leg
And stuck my nose in the butter
Now I wouldn't marry a wider
Tell you the reason why
She'd have so many children
They'd make those biscuits fly
Sixteen horses in my team
The leaders they are blind
And every time the sun goes down
There's a pretty girl on my mind
Eighteen miles of mountain road
And fifteen miles of sand
If ever travel this road again
I'll be a married man <start> here where the cold wind
blows across the fields
and the magpies
gather all that glitters
here where the old men
speak of long lost things
in a language
that never seems to matter
i think of you
here where your white walls
color in the past
and the windows are looking in on yesterday
i hear you voices
quiet like the night
i picture you in everything
i think of you
sometimes i think
that you might have been
something like rainbows on water
sometimes i think of how
life must have been for you here
what life could have been for you here
what life should have been
here with you
here where the cold wind
blows across the fields
and the magpies
gather all that glitters <start> Hello love my old friend
Sure is good to see you again
I stood out on the road
Just a watchin' the cars
A come and go
I felt empty I felt bare
I really thought that I could not care
All the leaves are soaking wet
How succulent a little spring day gets
If you kiss me once
Out here in the rain
We'll go back and start all over again
So lift up every voice and sing
Sing to the tree tops
And everything
Say hello love
My old friend
Sure is nice
To see you again <start> ONE SMALL MIRACLE
Writers Bill Anderson Steve Wariner
RECORDED BY BRYAN WHITE
She's standing at the front door With her suitcase in her hand I'm starin' down the hallway Frozen where I stand She says she doesn't love me anymore Oh Lord what can I do It's gonna take a miracle to make her stay That's why I'm askin' You. CHORUS Please don't you have a miracle Just lyin' around One small miracle nobody needs Send it on down I'll never make it thru this night Thinkin' she's with someone else Please don't You have Just one small miracle left I know I haven't been a Saint And asking You for anything takes nerve 'Cause You've already been blessed me With so much more in life than I deserve But if You can make a blind man see And change the water into wine Surely You can keep her from Tearin' out this old heart of mine. CHORUS TAG Please don't You have just one small miracle left <start> I used to sit alone at night and worry little darling
For I thought you meant the world to me
But now things have changed and those days are gone forever
So I'll never shed another tear
I'll never shed another tear now I don't care what happens
You have proved your love untrue to me
There's nothing you can do that will ever change my feelings
So I'll never shed another tear
With a broken heart I'll never forget the vows we made together
The many times you told me not to fear
But now you've forgotten and you've left me here forever
So I'll never shed another tear
Now you should have told me dear that you were only fooling
Then I'd never learn to love you so
Then I wouldn't have all these heartaches my darling
Dreading the day I see you go <start> I called you today
Wanting a change
I never meant to hurt anyone
Never meant for you to pull out your guns
But feelings won't stay
In this meager parade
You're beating to a different drum
In this lack of all the luster we've become
Save your breath
You know we've both
Tried our best
But it's leaving
This might as well be done
I'm falling with the sun
When the hours getting sour won't save with time
I'm waving off the one
Who wouldn't let me run
Though we tried it's a lie I can't keep dragging on
I'm untying this sinking stone
Don't sit on the fence
Living past tense
Holding on to wishes and words
Folding out a picture we blur
'Cause here in the end
I'm losing a friend
Fighting back a tear when it burns
Dividing up the pieces that we were
Save your breath
You know we've both
Tried our best
But it's leaving
This might as well be done
I'm falling with the sun
When the hours getting sour won't save with time
I'm waving off the one
Who wouldn't let me run
Though we tried it's a lie I can't keep dragging on
I'm untying this sinking stone
I can't say you're all alone
I'm accepting what I own
Here lies a blanket and not a bandage
I'm unable to restrain
When the wake that we became
Is drawing me under
This might as well be done
I'm falling with the sun
When the hours getting sour won't save with time
I'm waving off the one
Who wouldn't let me run
Though we tried it's a lie I can't keep dragging on
This might as well be done
I'm falling with the sun
When the hours getting sour won't save with time
I'm waving off the one
Who wouldn't let me run
Though we tried it's a lie I can't keep dragging on
I'm untying this sinking stone <start> Usa e abusa faz o que quiser de mim
Pode me ligar quando tiver a fim
No demora amor no sabe o que c t perdendo
Pode vir com tudo que hoje eu t um veneno
Veneno veneno veneno veneno
Pode vir com tudo que hoje eu t um veneno
Veneno veneno veneno veneno
Pode vir com tudo que hoje eu t um veneno
No me provoca c no sabe o perigo que eu sou
Eu sou sou perito na arte de fazer amor
Duvida vai queimar sua lngua no sabe o que diz
No espera vem pagar pra ver que eu te fao feliz
sou do tipo de pessoa Que faz e no fala que no perde tempo
Vem ni mim T facin
Hoje eu t um veneno <start> You make me promises that you don't keep
Tears are expensive honey words are cheap
You tell me one thing then do something else
And even though I know that all too well
I keep forgiving
I keep forgetting
I keep expecting you to change
You say you will
You say you will
You say you will
But you never do
Love doesn't come with any guarantee
It's give and take a little that's the key
So I give you every little thing you choose
An you give me back a stack of I.O.U.'s
There seems to be a pattern here
How can I tell if you're sincere
You say you will
You say you will
You say you will
But you never do
You say you will
You say you will
You say you will
But you never do <start> I was shivering I'll admit it
I had nothing better to do
Except to wheeze my lazy wheeze
Bernadette where are you
Bernadette where are you
She gets much acclamation
For such a self proclaimed Faustian
Bernadette doesn't like doubters
She wants to fight in the Coliseum
What can you tell me of Therese and Isabelle
Was it just fate that brought them together
Or did they will their unusual union
In cahoots of love or all of the above
In cahoots of love or all of the above <start> I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the ties that bind
Because you're mine I walk the line
I find it very very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me 'cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine I walk the line <start> Well you're the first car in an hour or so
I'm glad you stopped in it's sure been slow around here today
Just like everyday
Well I couldn't help but notice your California plates
And I thought I recognized that name on your credit card
You're a movie star
Well I can't wait to get back home and tell all my buddies
That I met one of the most famous people in the country
Chorus
Well I only go to movies when I'm down in Bowling Green
The cable don't come out this far so I never watch TV
I know you played in somethin' but I'm gonna need some help
Wait weren't you in Cannonball Run no oh well
Allow me to introduce myself
My name ain't John this is somebody else's greasy shirt my name's Kurt
This is the town that I grew up in
Never seen L.A. the closest I've been to Hollywood is Dollywood
But when you get back to Beverly Hills you can tell all your buddies
That you met one of the most famous people in the country
Chorus
Cause I caught the record small mouth out on Kentucky lake
And I threw the winning touchdown pass the night that we won state
And I'm still signin' autographs after all these years
Oh yeah guess I'm gonna need yours sign um here
I've been thinking about doing some acting some day
If I ever do make it out to L.A. can I give you a shout
Maybe crash on your couch
If you hear of any roles that are floating around
That would put me and Ashley Judd makin' out in a steamy love scene
Well I'd work pretty cheap
If the phones are down just ask around you'll get a hold of me
Cause I'm one of the most famous people in the country
Tag
You're talkin' to one of the most famous people in the country <start> You speak and the words flow like honey your kiss holds a promise so sweet
But all of these things that you tell me you tell to each new love you meet
Candy coated kisses sugar coated lies
Oh how I want to believe them but only a fool would try
You smile and my whole world turns sunny you know just the right things to say
Your words paint such beautiful pictures pictures that soon fade away
How many hearts have you broken how many lips have you kissed
I don't wanna know so don't tell me just add my name to your list
Candy coated kisses...
Only a fool would try only a fool would try  <start> Everybody needs one night
To go out in style
Try on a little spotlight
For a little while
I'm talking fancy

Two forks two knives
Bud Light in a glass

A good ole' boy could get used to
Keeping my shades on inside

And she tends to cry at the picture show
And she'll make plans without telling me
And I don't understand
I guess it's just a woman thing
Oh but whatever it is that I can't figure out
It all comes clear when she walks in
And the lights go down
And it's a mystery that I can't explain
But I love what she does to me
When she's doing that woman thing
Now she'll go on about losing weight
While all along I'm thinking she looks great
I never know where her mood will swing
'Cause I'm just a man
And that's just a woman thing
Oh but whatever it is that I can't figure out
It all comes clear when she walks in
And the lights go down
It's a mystery that I can't explain
But I love what she does to me
When she's doing that woman thing
Oh it's a mystery that I can't explain
I love what she does to me
When she's doing that woman thing
Oh I love what she does to me
When she's doing that woman thing <start> Living below in this old sinful world
Hardly a comfort can afford
Striving alone to face temptations call
Where could I go to the Lord
Where could I go where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord
Neighbors are fun I love them everyone
We get along in sweet accord
But when I pass the chilling hand of death
Where could I go to the Lord
Where could I go where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord
Life here is grand with friends I love so well
Comfort I get from God's own Word
But when my soul needs manna from above
Where could I go to the Lord
Where could I go where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord
Where could I go where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord
Where could I go to the Lord <start> 
I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine nothin' to do with you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I love you I do but I can't be true
Men are my weakness I've got a roving eye
And I've fallen victim to many a smile
I just love the excitement of love when it's new
I'm just a hopeless romantic so I can't be true I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine nothin' to do with you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I love you I do but I can't be true I can't be true
Some play it safe while some like it hot
I guess you could say I never knew when to stop
But when I'm lovin' you I'll give it all that I got
It might be different with you to know I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
Oh I get around and I break all of the rules
Now that you know it's true I'll leave the rest up to you
I'll be good to you but I can't be true I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine its not a weakness in you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I really love you I do but I can't be true I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
Oh I get around and I break all of the rules
Now that you know it's true I'll leave the rest up to you
I'll be good to you but I can't be true I can't be true <start> Winter comes and snow
I can't marry you you know
Without children to grow
I can't marry you you know
Love me the way I love you
Love me the way I love you
Take a year in your hand
You can find another man
Let your unloved parts get loved
And I will be your man
Love me the way I love you
Love me the way I love you
Places you should be afraid
Into the river we will wade
Love me the way I love you
Love me the way I love you <start> Can't seem to settle down
Maybe I'll just hang around
But every time you pick me up
I guess I take you down
But here I am again
You'll take me back and then
It won't be long till I'll be gone
Upon my way again
So I spend my days thinkin' up new ways
To do the same old thing
Seasons come and go without a name
And I spend my nights in the bright spotlights
Wishin' I could let the people know
Can't win or lose unless you play the game
Sittin' in the airport awaitin' on my plane
Nothin' to do for an hour or two
So I try to find a message in a picture I drew
In the corner of a letter from a boy I knew
Off the plane and through the rain into a limousine
The traffic's slow so I miss my show
But lookin' out the window somehow I know
That they're about to play my record
On the radio
So I write another song as I go along
To let you know just where I been
Don't want to meet myself at the masquerade
You can tell in the verse if I get worse
By the chorus I may be fine
A line my friend can end the kind charade
Layin' in my hotel room wantin' to be alone
Needin' the time to rest my mind
But they bring in another stack of papers to sign
And L.A.'s awaitin' on the other line
So I'm packin' up and I'm checking out
I'm on the road again
Feeling like I'm bringing pen to mind
But the words will come to me in their own time
Tumbling and stumbling over in rhyme
And the ugliest word that I ever heard
My friends is sacrifice
It's an easy out for all you should have been
And if there's one thing
That I just can't bring myself to compromise
It's blamin' somebody else for the state I'm in
Oh but then again
Daddy never loved his baby girl no how
Ah what's the difference now <start> You came into my life like an answer to a prayer
Like a star that falls from the sky right out of thin air
Some might say it's a miracle or a dream come true
But from that day I always knew
Chorus
Heaven is missing an angel
That's the only thing that it can be
Heaven is missing an angel
Cause you're right here with me
No one else in the world has touched me like you do
It's super natural girl the way I feel when I'm with you
I'm in paradise whenever you're around
Then when I look in your eyes there's no doubt
Heaven is missing an angel
That's the only thing that it can be
Heaven is missing an angel
Cause you're right here with me
I'm in paradise whenever you're around
Then when I look in your eyes there's no doubt
Heaven is missing an angel
That's the only thing that it can be
Heaven is missing an angel
Cause you're right here with me
Right here with me
You're right here <start> That boy took the heart of me
Then he threw it back at me
Thought I had a grip on it
That boy got away with it
I don't mind the lack of sleep
I find that it helps me think
Every night I lie awake
And listen to my poor heart break
That boy took the breath right out of me
Eyes like the lights on a Christmas tree
Just one look
I was hooked
Love so innocent too bad we never finished it
That boy got the best of me
Better than I thought I'd be
Oh oh he drove me to tears
That boy stripped all my gears
Hard case thought I'd never sell
I gave and he took it well
Lovesick worked overtime
Heartaches beat double time
That boy took the breath right out of me
Eyes like the lights on a Christmas tree
Just one look
I was hooked
Love so innocent too bad we'll never finished it <start> Here I sit all alone thinkin' 'bout what I should have known
You made me think that I could need you
You weaved your magic spell and I believed you
Lookin back on you and me
Promises that will never be
I truly thought that we were lovers
But now I find that I'm just like all the others
Heartbreaker wish I'd seen that love was blind
Sweet little love maker
Takin my heart and leave me behind
Heartbreaker couldn't you be
Just a little more kind to me
Played with fire felt its burn
I would have thought that I would have learned
I melted every time you kissed me
Each time you'd leave I thought that you would miss me
Heartbreaker wish that I'd seen that love was blind
Sweet little love maker
Takin' my heart and leave me behind
Heartbreaker couldn't you be
A little more kind to me
Heartbreaker wish that I had seen that love was blind
Sweet little love maker
Takin' my heart and leave me behind
Heartbreaker couldn't you be
Just a little more kind to me <start> It's not too late
Let me take you on a midnight drive
I might sound crazy baby
Maybe somewhere under the stars
In my car in the dark
We can park I don't care what we do
I just wanna see you
Dance for me dance for me
Throw it on the floor for me
Dance for me dance for me
Yeah come on girl
Get your hands in the air
Shake it down like you just don't care
We can do a little double dare
That's it right there the way you
Dance for me dance for me
The way you
Dance for me dance for me
I'm gonna sit back baby
Sip that Jack and watch you move
It won't be long before
I'm swaying right up next to you
In the lights of the night
Burning bright
From up here on my hood
You look so damn good
When you
Dance for me dance for me
Throw it on the floor for me
Dance for me dance for me
Yeah come on girl
Get your hands in the air
Shake it down like you just don't care
We can do a little double dare
That's it right there when you
Dance for me dance for me

When you
Dance for me dance for me
Come on girl let your hair down
Do a little dance for me
Come on girl let your hair down
Do a little dance for me
I got you and the moon
And the right little tune
And you know what to do
I just wanna see you
Dance for me dance for me
Throw it on the floor for me
Dance for me dance for me
Yeah come on girl
Get your hands in the air
Shake it down like you just don't care
We can do a little double dare
That's it right there when you
Dance for me dance for me
The way you
Dance for me dance for me
Yeah dance for me dance for me 
The way you dance for me dance for me
Yeah dance for me dance for me 
The way you dance for me dance for me <start> It's you that
I run to
Whenever I need to
Darling you console me
When trouble surrounds me
When bad times have found me
Just reach out your arms and hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Darling please take me
In your arms of safety
Reach out your arms
And hold me
Hold me
When my feelings are showing
When my tears are flowing
Just reach out
Reach out and hold me
Hold me
Hold me
You know all of my needs
You fill them completely
You know
That you control me
I depend on
Your lovin'
Without you
I'm nothin'
So reach out
Your arms and hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Darling please take me
In your arms of safety
Reach out you arms
And hold me
Hold me
When life is demanding
When I need understanding
Reach out
Reach out and hold me
Hold me
Hold me <start> Here I go again
Got my self in trouble
Baby I need help
Get here on the double
You must be the one
To show me signs so subtle
I think you ought to spend
More time inside my bubble
Looking for a heartache like you
Here's to everyone
Finding what they're after
So were the words
Of my uncle jasper
When I first saw you
At the honey sopping
You rocked me on down
To the feet of my pajamas
Looking for a heartache like you
What's a face like yours to kiss
Doing in a place like this
Even though I run the risk
Of losing you by saying all these things
I'll join up
If you're recruiting
We can ramble on
If the weather's suiting
Circle to the left
Go out a swinging
Something inside
Can't stop singing <start> Where is my love
Where is my love
Horses galloping
Bring him to me
Where is my love
Where is my love
Horses running free
Carrying you and me
Where is my love
Where is my love
Safe and warm
So close to me
In my arms
Finally
There is my love
There is my love
Horses galloping
Bringing him to me
Where is my love
Where is your love <start> You're the other half of me
You're the eyes through which I see
All alone I'm only half a girl
That with you I can be
You're the other half of me
Things I begin they always end half started
Things I say always sound half parted
I'm as helpless as a baby bird
That's fallen from a tree
You're the other half of me
You're the other half of me
You're the eyes through which I see
All alone I'm only half a girl
That with you I can be
You're the other half of me
You're the other half of me <start> Clyde Barrow told Bonnie Parker hon we're broke now so you better get your gun
Tell a driver put this Marmon in high you're gonna take another ride with Clyde
Oh the bullets flew and the Barrow gang knew they're running for their lives
When they pulled out of town they didn't even touch the ground
Taking another ride with Clyde
 dobro 
Give me water Bonnie honey give me gas when we leave here we had better leave it fast
If the law comes gonna leave 'em high and dry gonna take another ride with Clyde
Oh the bullets flew...
 banjo 
Bonnie said Clyde we had better lay low
We are trapped heres and there's no place to go
Clyde said girl this is no place to die you're gonna take another ride with Clyde
Oh the bullets flew...
I said taking another ride with Clyde <start> I know I've been untrue but now I love just you
If not sweetheart I'd still be there with him
If the spark of doubt remains and their talk has been to flame
I'll always be a sinner to them
Waggin' tongues and small town talk are to blame my dear not you
Don't ever let them drive me from your heart
I can never live it down with waggin' tongues around
Those waggin' tongues are tearing us apart
 steel 
Every Romeo in town has tried to come around
And hopes that all the things they heard were true
When they found it was a lie the truth they did deny
Those waggin' tongues took over and did prove
Waggin' tongues and small town talk... <start> Restless

Give me too many bad signs
I'll be gone and I can tell you why
Right or wrong that's just the way I am
I'm not looking for sympathy we either do or we don't agree
All I need to know is where I stand
So it's comin' right down to you
I wanna stay.if you want me to
But I don't wanna waste your time
So I don't want you wastin' mine
When the sun's sinkin' low I get so restless
Should I stay or go that is the question
I really need to feel that you'll never
Leave me alone maybe that's all I really need to know
Maybe I get too impatient when I sense your reservations
I guess I'm just scared you'll say goodbye
'cause I would hope I've let you know what it's like inside your love
I pray it lasts for more than just awhile
So it's time to make up your mind either way I will survive
Not knowing is enough for me to ride away
With a broken dream
When the sun's sinkin' low I get so restless
Should I stay or go that is the question
I really need to feel that you'll never
Leave me alone maybe that's all I really need to know <start> When the quiet in this old house shows no mercy
And the lonesome just won't go away
That's when your restless spirit haunts me
And I swear I hear you call my name
Chorus
I always loved the sound of your sweet voice
But now that sounds makes my poor heart break
You're long gone baby that's for certain
Cause I'm a hurtin' when I hear you call my name
I pray when I pass on over
That we will meet in the place where lost souls stay
Maybe then when I look over my shoulder
You'll be there when I hear you call my name
Chorus <start> I was just out of the service thumbing through the classifieds
When an ad that saidOld Chevy somehow caught my eye
The lady didn't know the yearor even if it ran
But I had that thousand dollars in my hand
It was way back in the corner of this old ramshackle barn
Thirty years of dust and dirt on that green army tarp
When I pulled the cover offit took away my breath
What she called a Chevy was a sixty six Corvette
I felt a little guilty as I counted out the bills
But what a thrill I got when I sat behind the wheel
I opened up the glove box and that's when I found the note
The date was nineteensixty six and this is what it wrote
He saidMy name is Private Andrew Malone
If you're reading thisthen I didn't make it home
But for every dream that shatteredanother one comes true
This car was once a dream of minenow it belongs to you
And though you may take her and make her your own
You'll always be riding with Private Malone
Well it didn't take me long at allI had her running good
I love to hear those horses thunder underneath her hood
I had her shining lika a diamond and I'd put the rag top down
All the pretty girls would stop and stare as I drove her through town
The buttons on the radio didn't seem to work quite right
But it picked up that oldie showespecially late at night
I'd get the feeling sometimesif I turned real quick I'd see
A soldier riding shotgun in the seat right next to me
It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that's shatteredanother one comes true
This car was once a dream of hisback when it was new
He told me to take her and make her my own
And I was proud to be riding with Private Malone
One night it was raining hardI took the curve too fast
I still dont remember much about that fiery crash
Someone said they thought they saw a soldier pull me out
They didn't get his name but I know without a doubt
It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that's shatteredanother one comes true
This car was once a dream of hisback when it was new
I know I wouldn't be here if he hadn't tagged along
That night I was riding with Private Malone
Ohthank GodI was riding with Private Malone <start> Oh beautiful child
You've got a garden of time waiting for you
There are fields full of wonder for you
to uncover out there
I wanna be here to watch you change and grow and fly
Your future is as open as a big blue sky
And who you are is something you've gotta find out for yourself
And your life belongs to just you and nobody else
live your dreams and follow your heart
You'll find out who you are
Oh sweet angel child your spirit's
as wild as a sallion
Your innocense is
like a blanket of fresh white snow
You'll make mistakes
but don't be afraid to take your chance
Just beleive in yourself and you'll make your own path
Who you are is something
you've gotta find out for yourself
And your life belongs to
Just you and nobody else
Life your dreams and follow your heart
You'll find out who you are
And I wish I could be the angel beside
you to guide you
And I wish I could show you the way
But I know I gotta let you go
And who you are is something
you gotta find out for yourself.
And your life belongs to
Just you and nobody else
Life your dreams and follow your heart
You'll find out who you are <start> Drove to the church
In my suit and tie
But I just couldn't bring myself
To go inside
So I sat alone
In my truck across the street
Watched that chauffeur smokin' cigarettes
By that long white limousine
I could just imagine
What was goin on in there
Sunlight streamin' through the stained glass
And those flowers in her hair
And in less time than it takes a tear to fall
Those bells rang loud as thunder
As they opened up the doors
Now I don't have to wonder anymore
Laughin and a cryin'
Tossin that bouquet
And when you got in that limo
I drove off the other way
And I still don't know
Why things happened like they did
But I parked that old pickup
On that lonesome river bridge
I took your ring from my pocket
And then I held it one last time
Watched that diamond sparkle
I drew back and I let her fly
And in less time than it takes a tear to fall
Oh that old ring went under
And now it's gone for sure
And I don't have to wonder anymore
Well the angels sang like thunder
As I felt myself go under
Now I don't have to wonder anymore <start> I've got every reason on earth to be mad
'Cause I just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't so I'll cry instead
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger that my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't so I'll cry instead
Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away
But I'll come back again someday
And when you do you'd better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world
Yes I'm gonna break them in two
And show you what your lovin' man can do
Until then I'll cry instead <start> Daily grind is stealing me away again
When I just want to lay back down
Another night gone and don't know where it went
What I need more than anything right now
Is time with you more time with you
To laugh and talk and play and make more love to you
Ah there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Then spend time with you
Seven days you and me in paradise
The world revolving around us
We'd still be there and forever if the choice was mine
'Cause seven days that's not enough
Is time with you more time with you
To laugh and talk and play and make more love to you
Ah there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Then spend time with you
Time with you
I'm gone for now to do the things I have to do
But baby you know I live
For time with you more time with you
To laugh and talk and play and make more love to you
Ah there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Then spend time with you
More time with you <start> If I hurt long enough then I won't hurt the more
If I cried hard enough my tears will stop to flow
That's what I tell myself each day I go through
But something is wrong cause I can't forget you
There's still someone I can't forget and there's still only one I care to be with
So when they ask me why not find somebody else
I say there's still someone I can't forget
There's still someone
Yes there's still someone I can't forget <start> I'll be loving you always
With a love that's true always
When the things you plan
Need a helping hand
I will understand always always
Days may not be fair always
That's when I'll be there always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year but always
Days may not be fair always
That's when I'll be there always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
And not for just a year but always <start> If I was a gambler
I tell you what I'd do
I'd quit my gambling
And I'd work on the building too
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
Hallelujah
I'm a working on building
For my Lord for my Lord
It's a Holy Ghost building
It's a Holy Ghost building
Hallelujah
It's a Holy Ghost building
For my Lord for my Lord
If I was a drunkard
I tell you what I would do
I'd quit my drinking
And I'd work on the building too
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
Hallelujah
I'm a working on building
For my Lord for my Lord
It's a Holy Ghost building
It's a Holy Ghost building
Hallelujah
It's a Holy Ghost building
For my Lord for my Lord
If I was a preacher
I tell you what I would do
I would keep on preaching
And I'd work on the building too
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
Hallelujah
I'm a working on building
For my Lord for my Lord
It's a Holy Ghost building
It's a Holy Ghost building
Hallelujah
It's a Holy Ghost building
For my Lord for my Lord <start> Dreaming Without You
The hopeful possibilities
Have come and gone away
We've both run out of reasons to stay
Who we are and who we thought we were has somehow changed
We kept trying anyway
It's just not gonna work
It's just not gonna fly
We've been frozen on the edge
Staring at goodbye
We've both reached for the stars
Shared the victories shared the scars
Made each other's dreams come true
I never thought I'd do
My dreaming without you
You'll go one way I'll go mine
And take some awkward steps
Almost free except for these regrets
Moving one's the only thing that we have left to do
No one can say we didn't see this through
But...
Repeat Chorus
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
We've both reached for the stars
Shared the victories shared the scars
Made each other's dreams come true
I never thought I'd do
My dreaming without you <start> I know you tried your best to love me
You smiled when your heart told you to weep
You tried to pretend that you were happy
Last night I heard you crying in your sleep
You gave the best years of your life dear
And each precious vow you tried to keep
I love you so much I want you happy
Last night I heard you crying in your sleep
Your heart is yearning for an old love
With new love it's useless to complete
It hurts me to know you are unhappy
'Cause last night I heard you crying in your sleep
You know that you are free to go dear
And don't mind if I start to weep
I know I can never make you happy
'Cause last night I heard you crying in your sleep <start> Nights in white satin
Never reaching the end
Letters I've written never meaning to send
Beauty I've always missed with these eyes before
Just what the truth is I can't say anymore
'Cause I love you
Yes I love you
Oh how I love you
Oh how I love you
Gazing at people some hand in hand
Just what I'm going through they can't understand
Some try to tell me thoughts they cannot defend
Just what you want to be you will be in the end
And I love you
Yes I love you
Oh I love you
How I love you
Nights in white satin
Never reaching the end
Letters I've written never meaning to send
Beauty I'd always missed with these eyes before
Just what the truth is I can't say anymore
And I love you
Yes I love you
Oh how I love you
How I love you
And I love you
Yes I love you
How I love you
Oh how I love you <start> Today the rain came down again
And washed away the light
So night could then descend
I saw your face again
The rains came down today
The things we had to say
Were also washed away
Again that was yesterday
And though I feel the same
I can't go back again
Ooh the rain
Oh I had that dream again
In the hour before the dawn
And I don't know what it means
But I saw your face again
The rains came down today
The things we had to say
Were also washed away
Again that was yesterday
And though I feel the same
I can't go back again
Because the rain is gone
It's gonna come another day
Ooh the rain
Ooh the rain <start> We work in the factories and the fields
Assembly lines and coal mines and the steel mills
That's what we do but there's more to us than that
If you want to know who we are it's on the logos of our caps
We're Mountaineers volunteers
We're the tide that rolls we're Seminoles
We're a herd of Longhorn steers
We drive Ford and Chevrolet
Shoot twentyfour and eightyeight
We crank up our music Friday nights
On two thousand country stations
Yeah we're one big country nation that's right
We might fix your water pump your AC
Bring your apple pie and fill your glass of tea
Take that Fedex package to your door
But underneath that apron or that uniform
We're Wild Cats Wolverines
We're Tigers Buckeyes Bruins
Bulldogs Hogs and Hurricanes
We pray before we race
Cheer fourteen and fortyeight
We drink icecold beer on Friday nights
Yeah we're one big country nation that's right
We're all across the map
Down city streets and old dirt roads
We're the fabric of this nation
And we're a nation all our own
We're Mountaineers we're volunteers
We're Devils Heels and Rebels
Fighting Irish and Cavaliers
We soup up our Chevrolets
Cheer twentyfour and eightyeight
And we crank up the same songs Friday night
On two thousand country stations
Yeah we're one big country nation that's right <start> Ain't ready for the leaves to change
Don't wanna get off this swing
No I ain't jealous
When the sun's kissing on you
Baby it's that southern wind
Baby it's your perfect skin
That's killing me
Through the holes
In your silver boots
Baby what's up
This is more than a crush
Already dressed like that
Heat rises it's a fact
Baby three months
Just ain't long enough
We can turn the clock back
Flip over the hour glass
Summer forever
Ain't nothin' better than
Love makin' weather
Summer forever
Hotter than winter
On that Silverado leather
The days are getting longer
Kisses getting stronger
It's the kinda song
That makes you wanna sing along
Summer forever
Oh oh
I'm talking fireworks
I'm talking on fire
Barefoot walking
Chasing whiskey
With a flat tire
Don't matter where we go
Let's ride an open road
And a sunroof open
Making up as we rolling like
Summer forever
Ain't nothin' better than
Love makin' weather
Summer forever
Hotter than winter
On that Silverado leather
The days are getting longer
Kisses getting stronger
It's the kinda song
That makes you wanna sing along
Summer forever
Yeah yeah woo
It don't matter where we go
Let's ride an open road
And a sunroof open
Making up and say we rolling like
It don't matter where we go
Let's ride an open road
And a sunroof open
Making up and say we rolling like
Summer forever
Ain't nothin' better than
Love makin' weather
Summer forever
Hotter than winter
On that Silverado leather
The days are getting longer
Kisses getting stronger
It's the kinda song
That makes you wanna sing along
Summer forever
Woah woah
That's right
You and me
The sunshine
The water
It's summertime
Forever <start> I stayed as drunk as I could
For longer than I should
Off rubyred lips and soft fingertips
And her long blonde hair
Was flowing everywhere
Like a red red wine
And its stoned my mind
What goes up must come down
It was a hard lesson learned
That was then this is now
Don't get too high on love
Or addicted to her touch
Don't get hung up on forever
'Cause there ain't no such
Don't get strung out on a woman
'Cause comin' down is the hardest part
When she walks away and leaves you
With a hungover heart
Oh I've tried to sober up
But I'm jonesin' way too much
For one more kiss
Mmm that heavenly bliss
And the longer that I'm dry
Takes me further back in time
When I was her man
Ooo when I was her man
Losin' her is gonna be the death of me
I can't drown her memory out
With Tennessee whiskey
Don't get too high on love
Or addicted to her touch
Don't get hung up on forever
'Cause there ain't no such
Don't get strung out on a woman
'Cause comin' down is the hardest part
When she walks away and leaves you
With a hungover heart
Don't get too high on love
Or addicted to her touch
Don't get hung up on forever
'Cause there ain't no such
Don't get strung out on a woman
'Cause comin' down is the hardest part
When she walks away and leaves you
With a hungover heart
Ooo hungover heart
She'll leave you with a hungover heart <start> Door slams car starts he's on the road
She's left there sitting angry and alone
Thinking what she should have said
Well maybe she should have gone to bed
Now his words are swirling around in her head
He said and she said
And they both yelled together
Neither one hearing or listening to the other
Words like 'you never..' and 'you don't understand'
One word then another
And then the whole thing's out of hand
But love's still there
It's just hiding in the dark 'cause it's scared
Hang on to those feelings that you know are true
And remember that this person means everything to you
Siren screams breaks through her dreams
She rolls to the right
She realizes that he's still lost to the night
She gets out of bed both worried and mad
She prays that he's safe her hanger holds back the drape
But love's still there
It's just hiding in the dark 'cause it's scared
Hang on to those feelings that you know are true
And remember that this person means everything to you
Door opens and in walks her baby
With a look on her face says 'I'm sorry'
Now's not the time or the place to play games
So you hold out your hand and he does the same
And love's still there
It's just hiding in the dark 'cause it's scared
Hang on to those feelings that you know are true
And remember that this person means everything to you
Love's still there
It's just hiding in the dark 'cause it's scared
Hang on to those feelings that you know are true
And remember that this person means everything to you <start> Oh you'll never miss the water till the well runs dry
You'll regret each and every time you've made me cry
You'll never miss me darling till I say goodbye
Oh you'll never miss the water till the well runs dry
You thought you were taking candy from a baby
But I caught you with your fingers in the pie
Now you'd better realize just what you're doing
Cause you'll never miss the water till the well runs dry
Oh you'll never miss the water...
 steel  dobro 
Well I've headed up to here with all your cheatin'
And those little lies you tell me on the sly
Now you'd better listen close to what I'm sayin'
Cause you'll never miss the water till the well runs dry
Oh you'll never miss the water...
Oh you'll never miss the water till the well runs dry <start> I had the world in my hand when you were in my arms
And our love seems to grow everyday
Then like a fool I wasn't true brought shame and hurt to you
Now the time has come for me to pay
Now the whole world is empty without you you're my life my dreams and my plans
I'll do anything to make it up to you and put back my ring on your hand
 fiddle 
There was a time I made you cry each time you said goodbye
And walked away leaving me all alone
I broke your heart hurt your pride and now you're not here by my side
Now I see I've done the same thing to me
Now the whole world is empty... <start> I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old jukebox
But when my money's all gone I'm on the telephone
Hollerin' hey hey mama can your daddy come home
Well I'm living fast and dangerously I've got plenty of company
When the moon comes up and the sun goes down
That's when I want to see the lights of town
Cause I'm a honky tonk man
It takes a purty little gal and a jug of wine
That's what it takes to make a honky tonk mind
The jukebox a moanin' honky tonk sound
That's when I want to lay my money down
Cause I'm a honky tonk man <start> Looking for the feelings
That used to tell me something's wrong
Like all the doubts
When love sent shivers down my spine
But all I'm feeling
Is pure and simply we belong
And what's come over me
Are chills of another kind
One emotion wrapped around me
One emotion I can hold on to
Wherever it's going is exactly where I want to be
One emotion's got a hold of you and me
There's nothing left
Of the useless things I used to feel
Only love now
As everything else just fades away
It's all around us
Though you might not see it
It's just as real as the wild horses
You would have to have to drag me away
One emotion wrapped around me
One emotion I can hold on to
Wherever it's going is exactly where I want to be
One emotion's got a hold of you and me <start> I'm kinda down about it
I'm kinda sick about this feeling
Talkin' brings it out
And I'm kinda short of feeling
I kinda got this feeling
That I'm losing everyone
So I'm rolling down the stairwells
Giving into stop sign language
Drinking brings it out
Kinda down about it
I've almost got this shotgun fired
Rio Torn and frayed back
Could this be all
Could it linger anymore
An endless fall I don't even know
Why I Should write it off
I'm the one who's being left out here <start> Oh all I needed was one look
One magic moment was all it took
From that moment I loved you so
Now that I found you
I'm never gonna let you go
Come on say it say it again
It sounds so good say it
One more time and then
Well if you mean it say it again
The hard part's over
And the loving part begins
Oh hold me closer make me warm
I feel wanted here in your arms
I've been lonely for too long
I've waited a lifetime
For you to come along
So on say it say it again
It sounds so good say it
One more time and then
Well if you mean it say it again
The hard part's over
And the loving part begins
Come on say it say it again
It sounds so good say it
One more time and then
Well if you mean it say it again
The hard part's over
And the loving part begins <start> I miss the changes taking place
thought i felt warmth in your embrace
all along your smiling face had a way of pulling me in
i didn't see all of the signs i guess that's why they say love is blind
you left me to realize the beginning of the end
CHORUS
now its me thats left holding on to the only love i've ever known
picking through pieces and never seem to think
how did it come to this the beginning of the end
In spite of all the pain i'm in
i'd let you break my heart again
relive those feelings i felt back then
that illiusion of love that you give
its hard to see me without you
broken in pieces torn into trying hard
just to make it through the beginning of the end
Repeat Chorus
Repeat Chorus <start> Once I told a lie just a little one but you wont believe <start> Upon the rugged cross of Calvary
Was there my blessed Savior cried
Forgive them for they know not what they do
Oh sinner friend for thee he died
His hands are gently knocking on your door
Outside he's pleading to come in
His heart is breaking as he waits for you
To wash you free from every sin
Someday he's coming back to claim his own
We'll fly to Heaven's golden shore
A crown of life he gives on that glad day
With him we'll live forever more
Those cruel thorns they pierced my Savior's head
The blood was flowing down his face
In shame forsaken there he hung and died
Oh sinner friend he took you place <start> Rising times at five the red sun is still sleeping
My pillow is my saddle stars are my ceiling
My old body is ackin' I got a young cold needin' breaking.
But you know I can't complain
Thank god something's never change.
There is a storm somewhere that's brewin'
Cause these old bones are creakin'
The cows will soon be down
That ole roof's a leakin'.
Got a truck that needs attendin'
And some fences needin' mendin'
And I know it must sound strange
But thank God something's just never change.
Chorus
They fenced in all the free land
And the old wells run the range
Long gone are the cattle drives
Since they brought in the trains.
But the hard work and the friendships still remain
Thank God something's never change.
Out here where nature rules
Each day is a different battle
And it still takes a man working in the saddle. <start> There's a picture that I carry
One we made some time ago
When they ask who's in the picture with me
I say just Someone I use to know
Just someone I used to spend some time with
Just a flame that's lost its glow
But I don't them of the nights I cried without you
I say just Someone I use to know
Just someone I use to run around with
Just a friend from long ago
I don't tell them how lost I am without you
I say just Someone I use to know
I say just Someone I use to know <start> The love you thought was dead and gone
Somehow keeps on hanging on
Even when your heart has left it far behind
Just when you have turned the page
It seems to find a way
There it is again
Every now and then
Chorus
And every now and then that old feeling comes around
Every now and then I see your face in another cloud
And every now and then some old something takes me right back again
Every now and then
You can finally breathe life in
Without wondering where she's been
Go to sleep at night without her on your mind
In a second it appears
Followed by familiar tears
Like a long lost friend
Every now and then
Chorus
And I know it's all for nothing
There's no going back to way back then
Chorus
I still love you
Every now and then <start> Oh the games people now every night and every day now
Never meanin' what they say now never sayin' what they mean
So they wile away the hours in their ivory towers
Till they're covered up with flowers in the back of a black limousine
Lotten da la da da da lotten da la a dee de dee
I'm talkin' bout you and me and the games people play
Oh we make one another cry break a heart then we say goodbye
Cross our hearts and we hope to die that the other one's to blame
Oh neither one will ever give in so we gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' bout the things that might have been and it's a dirty rotten shame
Lotten da la da da da...
Guitar Interlude
People walkin' up to ya singing glory hallelujah
Then they're tryin' to sock it to you in the name of the Lord
They're gonna teach you how to meditate read your horoscope and cheat your fate
And furthermore to hell with hate come on and get on board
Lotten da la da da da...
Look around and tell me what you see what's happened to you and me
God grand me the serenity to remember who I am
Cause you've given up your sanity for your pride and your vanity
Turn your back on humanity and you don't give a lot
Lotten da la da da da...
Yes I'm talkin' bout you and me and the games people play <start> Home game little league
Bottom of the th it was up to me
The bunt sign a man on rd
Tie the game Coach That's absurd
I made my mind up at the plate if I see that fast ball
Well I just might have to swing away
Big deal so what
I had to take that home run cut
My life just don't make sense
If I ain't swinging for the fence
Home girl major league
Everybody said she's too good for me
Prom night she had a date
But I asked her to dance anyway
Then I gave her a kiss on her front porch swing
Then she thought it was funny
When I said Someday I'm gonna buy you a ring
Big deal so what
If it takes everything I got
My life just don't make sense
If I ain't swinging for the fence
Home game minor league
She up in the stands still pulling for me
The bunt sign a man on rd
I'm looking for that inside curve
But he came hard with his fast ball last time I saw
It was heading out over centerfield wall
Yeah big deal so what
Now they want to pay me a million bucks
My life just don't make sense
If I ain't swinging for the
Big deal so what
I had to take that home run cut
My life just don't make sense
If I ain't swinging for the fence
Swinging for the fence
Swinging for the fence
Cold beer hot dogs <start> I feel I'm flyin' blind when I know that my mind won't believe me
Not much to be said when my heart and my head still deceive me
Don't offer up help that you know that I won't be needin'
Cause I do it to myself like I never get tired of bleedin'
Can I trust you now
Not to pull me out
Of this cautionary tale that you know that I won't readin'
Cautionary tale that you know that I won't be readin'
Make another dime just to lose it in time what's the meanin'
They'll take what they can get for work can be sad oh believe me
An' I know I've been there to follow the night I guess always
If I can make outside of these narrow minded hallways
Can I trust you now
Not to pull me out
Of this cautionary tale that you know that I won't readin'
Cautionary tale that you know that I won't be readin'
Cautionary tale that you know that I won't be readin'
Cautionary tale that you know that I won't be readin'
Cautionary tale that you know that I won't be readin'
Cautionary tale to my own avail I'll be leavin'
Cautionary tale that you know that I won't be readin'
 <start> 
I can still see that lonesome road stretched out before me
The road that led me out of his life
I can still feel the tears he cried on my shoulder
The day that I told him goodbye
I never should'a left him
Never should'a gone
Oh what a crazy fool I've been
Will he be waiting for me
He will be won't he
And will he take me back again
He will be waiting for me
He will be won't he
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died
He will be waiting for me
He will be won't he
Or will I find that this time
I'll be the one to cry
Shadows from the trees
Shade the path that I am walkin'
As I make my way back up that windy road again
The smell of mountain laurel fills the air with sweet perfume
My heart beats faster as I near my journey's end
I wonder if he missed me
Wonder if he wants me
I wonder does he love me still
Will he be waiting for me
He will be won't he
Oh how I hope he will
He will be waiting for me
He will be won't he
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died
He will be waiting for me
He will be won't he
Or will I find that this time
I'll be the one to cry
He will be waiting for me
He will be won't he
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died
He will be waiting for me
He will be won't he
Or will I find that this time
I'll be the one to cry
Cry mmmm <start> Deserts grow cold
Rivers run dry
We give up on each other without thinking twice
Hope gets lost
Can't see the dawn
When the storm just won't let up give us the faith to carry on
When we get scared
Let this be our prayer
God keep us safe safe tonight
Keep our eyes toward the skies
Send down an army of angels
To make us brave
And keep us strong and unafraid
God keep us safe
We walk a thousand steps in the wrong direction
Broken and bruised wearing tattered shoes
Asking Him a thousand questions
But we go on
Trying to get back home
And through the struggles and the troubles I know we don't walk alone
Even when we get lost through the valleys we crossed
God keep us safe safe tonight
And keep our eyes toward the skies
Send down an army of angels
To make us brave
And keep us strong and unafraid
God keep us safe
God keep us safe <start> By David Allan Coe and Ann McGowan

DADDY LEFT ME THIS OLD GUITAR THOUGH I NEVER QUITE KNEW WHY
HE SAID SOMEDAY I'D BE FAMOUS LIKE THAT TEXAS LULLABY
BUT IT'S BEEN A MONTH OF SUNDAYS SINCE I SEEN THAT EDGE FLY
AND NOBODY WANTS TO LISTEN TO A TEXAS LULLABY <start> 
Momma never seemed to miss the finer things in life
If she did she never did say so to daddy
She never wanted to be more than mother and a wife
If she did she never did say so to daddy
The only things that seemed to be important in her life
Was to make our house a home and make us happy
Momma never wanted anymore than what she had
If she did she never did say so to daddy
He often left her all alone
She didn't mind the stayin' home
If she did she never did say so to daddy
And she never missed the flowers
And the gifts he never gave her
If she did she never did say so to daddy
Being took for granted was a thing that she accepted
And she didn't need those things to make her happy
She didn't even seem to notice
That he didn't kiss and hold her
If she did she never did say so to daddy
One morning we awoke
Just to find the note
That momma carefully wrote
And left to daddy
And as he began to read it
Our ears could not believe it
The words that she had written there to daddy
She said our kids are old enough
And they don't need me very much
So I've gone in search for love I need so badly
I have needed you so long
But I just can't keep holdin' on
She never meant to come back home
If she did she never did say so to daddy
Momma's gone
Goodbye to daddy <start> I'm gonna buy me a great long ticket gonna leave on the midnight train
And I don't care about the destination just as long as I leave today
Gonna pack all of my belongings gonna take everything I own
And if anybody ask about me just say I've been here and gone
And you can reach me in Alabama Louisiana or maybe Tennessee
Indiana or Montana or even Missouri
North Dakota Minnesota or Washington DC
Anyplace that I can find to lose your memory
Well I'm gonna start all over cause I got a lotta livin' to do
And the sooner that I get started the sooner I forget about you
I'm gonna live a life of rally and happy I'm a gonna be
And just in case you're interested well here's where you can find me
You can reach me in...
You can find me anyplace that I can find to lose your memory <start> Friends I could count on I could count on  hand with a left over finger or two. I took them for granted let them all slip away now where they are I wish I knew.
They roll by just like water  I guess we never learn go through life parched and empty standing knee deep in a river dying of thirst.
Sometimes I remember the good people I've known some I've forgotten I suppose. One or two still linger oh I wonder now why I ever let them go.
They roll by just like water  I guess we never learn go through life parched and empty standing knee deep in a river dying of thirst.
So the side walk is crowded the city goes by I just rushed through another day  a world full of strangers turn their eyes to me but I just look the other way.
They roll by just like water  I guess we never learn go through life parched and empty standing knee deep in a river dying of thirst.
Go through life parched and empty standing knee deep in a river dying of thirst <start> Way downtown just foolin' around
Took me to the jail
It's oh me and it's oh my
No one to go my bail
It was late last night when Willie came home
I heard him arapping on the door
He's aslipping and asliding with his new shoes on
Mamma said Willie don't you rap no more
Way downtown just foolin' around
Took me to the jail
It's oh me and it's oh my
No one to go my bail

I wish I was over at my sweet Sally's house
Sittin' in that big armed chair
One arm around this old guitar
And the other one around my dear
Way down town just foolin' around
Took me to the jail
It's oh me and it's oh my
No one to go my bail

Now its one old shirt is all that I got
And a dollar is all that I crave
I brought nothing with me into this old world
Ain't gonna take nothing to my grave
Way down town just foolin' around
Took me to the jail
It's oh me and it's oh my
No one to go my bail <start> At first mom and papa called their little boy Ned
They raise him on the banks of the river bed
A houseboat tied to a big tall tree a home for my papa and my mama and me
The clock strikes three papa jumps to his feet
Already mama's cookin' papa somethin' to eat
At half past papa he's ready to go he jumps in his piro headed down the bayou
He's got fishin' lines strung across the Louisiana River
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
Headin' crops in the swamp catchin' everythin' he can
Gotta make a livin' he's a Louisiana man gotta make a livin' he's a Louisiana man
Muskart hides a hangin' by the dozen even got a lady make a muskart's cousin
Pile of hide drying in the hot hot sun tomorrow papa's gonna turn them into money
Well they call mama Rita and my daddy Jack
A little baby brother on the floor that's Mac
Riz and Liz are the family twins big brother Ed's on the bayou fishin'
On the river float papa's great big boat that's how my papa goes into town
He takes every bit of the night and day
Then ever reach the place where the people stay
I can hardly wait till tomorrow comes around
That's the day my papa takes his fure to town
Papa promised me that I could go even let me see a cowboy show
I saw the cowboys and Indians for the first time then I told my papa gotta go again
Papa said son we got the lines to run we'll come back again there's work to be done
He's got fishin' lines... <start> Writers screamin'
Phones ringin'
Secretary's sayin' that the mailman's bringin' me
A stack of see's
And assists.
Man I'm gettin' sick and tired of this.
Cause all I did was take a hit song.
Swear I didn't know it
When I re wrote it
That I was doin' any thing wrong.
Well if Phil Vassar's
Mad at me
Well it's just another day in parodies.
There's no song that's safe from me.
Well make sure.
We'll see.
But I don't get any loyalty
Still I ask my label
Pretty please
Ooh for just another day in parodies.
I'm a big star
New cars
Never thought I'd take a joke this far after CMA's
I sat beside
Garth Brooks and his exwife.
But lately
It seems like
I catch hell for every song I write
Funny videos
I've done a few
Makin' people laugh's all I want to do.
But last night I had a bad dream.
CMT banned me
GAC canned me
They won't play no more comedy.
Well lawsuits
Legal E's
It's just another day in parodies.
Well there's nothin else
I can really sing.
I'll take one of Faith's
Two of Tim's.
I've always had great love for them.
That's my very own
Recipe
Ooh for just another day in parodies.
Well if Shania Twain's
Mad at me
It's just another day in parodies.
But deep down
She wants to be Cledus T.
Chaching
Chaching.
I wish the cash register would ring.
Oh I bet that Al
Would agree
Ooh It's just another day in parodies.
Just another day in parodies.
 <start> Sunday afternoon church potluck
George Jones blaring from my grandpa's truck
Granny's fried chicken and her sweet tea
Now that's a bittersweet memory
The old tire swing where my little boys play
Well that was me only yesterday
Doing double back flips off the branch in the tank
Kissing on you and fishing from the bank
We've had some good times got through the bad times
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times
Strong as an oak solid as a hickory
That's a love made in the shade of our family tree
Passed down from my granny and my grandpa
Mom and daddy kept it safe kept it sturdy and tall
Summers were hot winters were long
But our roots were deep and our faith was strong
Now some are gone and some are all grown
You and me baby branched out on our own
With every sunset comes another sunrise
I can see my daddy in our little boys' eyes
We've had some good times got through the bad times
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times
Strong as an oak solid as a hickory
That's a love made in the shade of our family tree
Lost love once throughout the years
Remember their smiles and dry those tears
'Cause they'll live on in your heart and mine
So let love grow like a country vine
We've had some good times got through the bad times
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times
Strong as an oak solid as a hickory
That's a love made in the shade of our family tree
Made in the shade of our family tree
Sunday afternoon church potluck
George Jones blaring from my grandpa's truck
A family that prays together
Is a family that stays together
Love the Lord thy God and Savior
With all your heart and love thy neighbor
A family that prays together
Is a family that stays together
Love the Lord thy God and Savior
With all your heart and love thy neighbor <start> Your forever telling me I'm weak
When I'm critized I never speak
I prefer to turn the other cheek
But I will love you all my life
I can never do things right by you
I'm the kind of man who muddles thru
You can find mistakes in all I do
But I will love you all my life
Something foolish happens and you see
In the Middle of it all is me
Seems I cause you so much misery
But I will love you all my life
All my life All I own
Everything is yours alone
Everyday my whole life thru
I will spend loving you
Everybody says for you I'm wrong
You'll get nowhere Fast with me along
They keep telling me I don't belong
But I will love you all my life
All my life All I own
Everything is yours alone
Everyday my whole life thru
I will spend loving you
I will love you all my life <start> I'm a high wire act without a net
I'm a tips all in on a losing bet
Im a minor cord on an old guitar
I'm one too many in a crowded bar
Don't you wanna fall
Don't you wanna fall
Fall down here where an angel should know better than
To walk around this world with me
All the girls love to talk about forever
From way up here the talk is always cheap
Don't you wanna fall
Don't you wanna fall
You're that first good buzz at seventeen
You're the good guy winning on the movie screen
You're a candle burning in the church in Rome
You're a first class ticket on the last plane home
But don't you wanna fall
Don't you wanna fall
Fall down here where an angel should know better than
To walk around this world with me
All the girls love to talk about forever
From way up there the talk is always cheap
Don't you wanna fall
Don't you wanna fall <start> Papa was a simple man papa loved his farming land
Guess I didn't understand please forgive me papa
You can't paint a picture of a man like papa with something as empty as words
'Cause there's no way to measure the thoughness of timber
And compare it to the softness of birds
Papa was both and yet he was neither just a hard working God fearing soul
He gave what he had to the ones that he loved and I guess he loved me best of all
For I was the oldest and we were the closest we worked that old farm side by side
I guess that's the reason it hit me the hardest the morning that my papa died
All I could think of was how hard he'd worked and what little comfort he'd found
I guess that's the reason I hitched up the mule and drove the old buggy to town
I picked out a lot in the big cemetery in the shade of a tall maple tree
Figured it's the least I could do for my papa
After all the things that he's done for me
We gave him a funeral fit for a king and then we laid him to rest in the sod
Somehow I thought that in that big pretty place he just might feel closer to God
The women were crying as they passed by papa the men stopped and all shook my hand
Most of the mourness had gone when I looked up and noticed this white haired old man
He was dressed kinda shabby and he walked with a cane his voice was shaky and low
I had to look twice before I rocognized him he used to work for us a long time ago
They told me this morning that the big boss had died
And I thought that I should come around
I went out to the homeplace to tell him goodbye
They told me that you done brought him to town
I remember your papa used to say that when he died he didn't have but one request
He wanted to be burried out dare on that farm
He said there wadn't nowhere else that he could rest
When I heard what you'd done I fatched me a shovel found me an old paper sack
I scooped up some dirt from up near the farmhouse
And thought that I'd just bring it back
I hope you don't mind if I just sorta scatter these few little pieces of clay
It ain't gonna mess up your pretty green grass he just might sleep better this way
Guess I didn't understand please forgive me papa <start> I got up with a full and happy heart
Another sunny day
I couldn't wait to start
I combed my hair
Walked down the stairs
To wait for the phone to ring
Just before the momen that I lost everything
You didn't call so I thought I'd go to you
Thought I'd surprise you with some flowers
That I tied all up in blue
I skipped and hopped
For seven blocks
And with every skip I'd sing
Just before the moment that I lost everything
I couldn't wait to see your face when I arived
For your sweet love's the only reason I'm alive
And I swear I sit inside my head
I know I'd rather die
Than to be without that woman in my life
I walked up your stairs
And knocked at your front door
And I heard the creek of footsteps
Walking on the floor
You didn't come to answer it
So I gave the bell a ring
Just before the moment that I lost everything <start> The stars up in the sky remind me of your eyes
And the way they use to gaze into mine
The moon up above brings back memories of love
I thought was true and so divine
So never again oh never no more
Never again will I knock upon your door
Never again but these words I can say
I'll try not to love and stay out of your way
We had the greatest start but deep within your heart
You led me on before I knew the score
You cheated and you lied I stayed right by your side
Until one day simply closed the door <start> I remember trying not to stare the night that I first met you
You had me mesmerized
And  weeks later in the front porch light taking  min to kiss goodnight
I hadn't told you yet but I thought I loved you then
Chorus
Now you're my whole life now you're my whole world
I just can't believe the way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it's ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then.
I remember taking you back to right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There were people around
But I didn't care I got down on one knee right there
And once again I thought I loved you then
Chorus
Now you're my whole life now you're my whole world
I just can't believe the way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it's ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then.
I can just see you with a baby on the way
I can just see you when your hair is turning gray
What I can't see is how I'm ever gonna love you more
But I've said that before.
Now you're my whole life now you're my whole world
I just can't believe the way I feel about you girl
Well look back some day at this moment that we're in
And I'll look at you and say and I thought I loved you then
And I thought I loved you then... <start> Love is a shiny car
Love is a steel guitar
Love is a battle scar
Love is a morning song
Love is a twelvebar blues
Love is your blue suede shoes
Love is a heart abused
Love is a mind confused
And love is the pleasures I'm told
And for some love is still a band of gold
My love has no reason has no rhyme
My love cross the double line
Love is a mine of gold
Love is a man to hold
Love is a drowning soul
Love is it's own reward
And love is the pleasures I'm told
And for some love is still a band of gold
My love has no reason has no rhyme
My love cross the double line
And love is the pleasures I'm told
And for some love is still a band of gold
My love has no reason has no rhyme
My love cross the double line
Oh my love cross the double line
Oh my love cross the double line <start> Don't act surprised it ain't like you didn't know
It's been a long long time comin' and it's time for me to go
Time to split things up that drive us crazy
So I'm gunna make this easy baby
You can have the money
You can have the house
Take the cadillac and that boat out back
And your mother's pink and yellow couch
You can have every penny that I'll make from this here song
Girl all I want you to leave me is alone
Don't get me wrong I will always love you girl
You were my life you were my heart you were my world
But we both know it's over there's no need to fight it
Girl I just need some peace and quiet
So you can have the money
You can have the house
Take the Cadillac and that boat out back
And that ugly pink and yellow couch
You can have every penny that I will make from this here song
Girl all I want you to leave me is alone <start> I'm a long gone Waylon song on vinyl
I'm a backroads sinner at a tent revival
She believes in me like she believes her bible
And loves me like Jesus does.
I'm a left foot leaning on a suped up Chevy
I'm a good ol' boy drinking whiskey and rye on the levee
But she carries me when my sins make me heavy
And she loves me like Jesus does.
All the crazy in my dreams
Both my broken wings
Every single piece of everything I am
Yeah she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
And the devil man he don't stand a chance
Cause she loves me like Jesus does.
Always thought she'd give up on me one day
Wash her hands of me leave me staring down some runway
Yeah I thank God each night and twice on Sunday
That she loves me like Jesus does.
All the crazy in my dreams
Both my broken wings
Every single piece of everything I am
Yeah she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
And the devil man he don't stand a chance
Cause she loves me like Jesus does
Yeah she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
And the devil man he don't stand a chance
Cause she loves me like Jesus does.

Right behind the dairy queen and the one hundred and eight bus stop
There's a little house I can see it in my mind
Oh I should turn around but I keep on driving by
'Cause you're there with her
And I don't know who's got it worse
Me you or her
I've got her number in my book
I've got it memorized don't even have to look
Oh just the thought of dialing makes my heart race
Oh I could call her up but what would I say
'Cause you're there with her
And I don't know who's got it worse
In this game we all play
Who'll be smart enough to walk away
Me you or her
There are no rings or vows
Being broken or tossed around
Just three hearts all waiting to see
If you wind up over here with me
Or there with her
'Cause you're there with her
And I don't know who's got it worse
In this game we all play
Who'll be smart enough to walk away
Me will it be you or will it be her
Just down the street eight city blocks
Right behind the dairy queen and the one hundred and eight bus stop
There's a little house I can see it in my mind
Oh I should turn around but I keep on driving by <start> There's something pretty in a summer rainbow there not just colors anymore
And there's something pretty in the way the stars flow something I never saw before
There's so many pretty things the whole world looks new
I never saw the sun until I fell in love with you
And now there's something pretty in the side old moonlight
Or did it always blow that way
'Cause there's something pretty in the same old tonight
Something pretty everywhere today
There's so many pretty things
There's something pretty pretty there's something pretty pretty
There's something pretty pretty there's something pretty pretty <start> Will anybody know I've been here when I'm gone
Will anything that I've done here live on
Every man's allowed just so much time
And all you take along is what you leave behind
Will anybody know I've been here when I'm gone
When I'm gone when I'm gone
Oh will anybody know I've been here when I'm gone
Will anybody cry just a little bit when I'm gone
Will anybody cry just a little bit when I'm gone
Will the things I've tried so hopefully all turn to dust alongside of me
Will anybody know I've been here when I'm gone
When I'm gone when I'm gone
Oh will anybody know I've been here when I'm gone
Will anybody think about me when I'm gone
Will anybody ever remember me when I'm gone
Will they call me failure or success did I really live or just exist
Will anybody know I've been here when I'm gone
When I'm gone when I'm gone
Oh will anybody know I've been here when I'm gone
Will anybody know I've been here when I'm gone <start> Does your conscience ever bother you
When somebody calls my name
Tries to think of all that I've gone through
And hang your head in shame
Someone came along and took my place
Then you gave me all the blame
You should go somewhere and hide your face
And hang your head in shame
When you said I was the only one
Was it just your little game
Now look back at all the harm you've done
And hang your head in shame
I should hate you but I love you still
In my heart I kept the flame
You'll be sorry darling yes you will
And hang your head in shame
I should hate you but I love you still
In my heart I kept the flame
You'll be sorry darling yes you will
And hang your head in shame
Yeah and hang your little head in shame <start>  Dickie  Leroy Sanland

Tired of the glamor and tired of the sights
In all my dreams I am roaming once more
Back to my home on the old river shore
I am sad and weary far away from home
Miss the Mississippi and you
Days are dark and dreary
Everywhere I go
Miss the Mississippi and you
Roaming the wide world over
Always along and blue
Nothing seems to cheer me under Heaven's door
Miss the Mississippi and you
I'm growing tired on the big city lights
Tired of the glamor and tired of the sights
In all my dreams I am roaming once more
Back to my home on the old river shore
I am sad and weary far away from home
Miss the Mississippi and you
Days are dark and dreary
Everywhere I go
Miss the Mississippi and you
Mississippi and you <start> Water may stop warmth this do not forget
When things become too warm make them a little wet
And douse them with a mouthful put the baby down
Clean the earth surrounding and cause the warm to drown
And introduce to every soul a drink made of tears
Hear them bicker watch them die impaled on balsa spears
And looking in the morning the streets are flooded out
The men are wailing toothless the ladies ghostly pout
And they shout
Our shoes are wet our skin is cold
And we no longer fear the voices of the brave or bold
Making what is to come clear
Well future is diminished by what today we did
We wetted warmth and killed it and in the water hid
We wetted warmth and killed it and in the water hid <start> Ooh but love was just so hard to find
'Til you came along into my life
And then I thought I would lose my mind
When you said that you wanted to be mine
And ever since that day I've been hooked
Nothin' can turn me away
This livin' with you is like a dream come true
And it grows more and more everyday
Ooh I'm reachin' the highest of highs
Every time I look into your eyes
You ask how I feel I can say it out loud
I feel like a million inside
I never thought this could happen to me
You got me just where you wanted me baby
And for your love I would do anything
Every night I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool and I can't get enough
Drivin' home from this sleepy old town
When my day's work is all through
The sun and the lights well I wish I could fly
To get back faster to you
I waited all day by the telephone
Starin' at the clock on the wall
The hours are so long when you're free from my arms
And I just can't wait to hold you
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool and I can't get enough
Ooh you're givin' me chills up my spine
I'm feelin' so fine goin' out of my mind
And I don't care if it never stops
I'll love you right up until I drop
You know I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool and I can't get enough
'Cause I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool I'm a fool I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool and I can't get enough
For I'm a fool for your love

' Fort Knox Music
Oh jealous me and careless you the odds were just too great
I couldn't take those lonely nights you made me sit and wait
I thought I'd seen the last of you when you walked out of sight
Instead I see you in my dreams each night
So the key's in the mailbox come on in
I'm sitting here wishing dear I had your love again
I'll never even ask you where you've been
The key's in the mailbox come on in
I said I'd rather be alone than share your company
I said don't come around at all if you want more than me
But sitting here alone I can't deny the flame that burns
I'd gladly take you back on any terms
So the key's in the mailbox... <start> I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
If he brings you happiness then I wish you both the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if he ever breaks your heart if the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
Though it hurts to let you go darling I want you to know
And I'll stand by you if ever you should call
And if I should ever hear that he made you shed a tear
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
To dry away every teardrop that you cried
If he ever leaves you blue just remember I love you
And I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
And I'll be there before the next teardrop falls <start> Paper Mansions
Don't build for me no paper mansions
That only stand until you've gone
You've paint the nastiest futures of anyone I know
You always leave me holding on to pretty words that glow
You've built a thousand mansions out of dreams that seemed so strong
But they're always made of paper not of stone
Don't build for me no paper mansion
That I can never call my own
For love can't live in paper mansions
That only stands until you've gone
Piano
You've always been a dreamer dear and I'm a dreamer too
But I guess I've had too many of the time that don't come true
So don't build me no mansion with paper walls so thin
That only stand until you leave again
DonEt build for me no paper mansion
That I can never call my own
For love canEt live in paper mansions
That only stands until youEve gone <start> Memories in Gold 
Those melodies that we two crossed years . . .
Have underscored our laughter and our tears
With every phrase we see the . . . past unfold . . .
Like memories in gold.
Some tunes remind us of our childhood days . . .
Sunday afternoons and . . . songs of praise . . .
Reflecting happy times in . . . joys untold . . .
These memories in gold.
From those early nursery rhymes . . .
Through our adolescent times . . .
We find more varied as we went along . . .
And how could we go wrong . . .
And how could we go wrong . . .
With a special song . . .
That would always . . . see us through
Our lives without them might be . . . cold and bleak . . . Our favorite song is more than words can speak . . .
They helped me win your love to heaven hold . . .
Sweet memories in gold.
When the band played rock and roll . . .
And the people called it soul . . .
Our favorite songs were like a tapestry . . .
Edged in melody . . .
They would always be . . . part of you and . . part of me.
Theres little more to add when . . . songs are sung . . .
The words and music help . . . keep us young . . .
And so were not afraid of . . . growing old . . .
With memories . . . lets hear them please . . .
Sweet memories in gold. <start> ELI THE CAMEL
Now there's an old brown camel on a cigarette pack
He's awaiting for his master but he ain't come back
Been standin' there for years in the same old place
With the same old look upon his old long face

Eli the camel he never gets a drink
I wonder what old Eli thinks
Standing on the front of that cigarette pack
Eli the camel with the hump upon his back
Now I have often wondered what his master did
When he went behind that big pyramid
Some say he got a sunstroke and the old man died
But I think he's at the hotel on the other side
He probably found a harem and he moved on in
Forgot all about his faithful friend
Standing on the front of that cigarette pack
Eli the camel with the hump upon his back

He never gets no loving and he don't have any fun
He keeps right on astanding in the burning sun
Standing all the time on that cigarette pack
Eli the camel with the hump upon his back
If old Eli could talk well I'll bet my boots to you
He could tell the world a thing or two
He's been all around the world and back
Riding on the front of that cigarette pack

EEEEli <start> The bar was empty I was sweeping up the floor
That's when she walked in I said I'm sorry but we're closed
And she said I know but I'm afraid I left my purse
I said I put one back behind the bar I bet it's probably yours
And the next thing that I knew
There we were lost in conversation
And before I handed her her purse
I said You'll only get this back on one condition
And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
The music played we held each other close
And we danced
And from that moment there was never any doubt
I had found the one that I had always dreamed about
And then one evenin' when she stopped by after work
I pulled a diamond ring out of the pocket of my shirt
And as her eyes filled up with tears
She said This is the last thing I expected
And then she took me by the hand
And said I'll only marry you on one condition
And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
The music played we held each other close
And we danced
Like no one else had ever danced before
I can't explain what happened on that floor
But the music played we held each other close
And we danced yeah we danced <start> Well I'm talking 'bout a hometown
A little party back in the pines

Explain to me
How this can be
Another face erased
From this tidal pool
Found one day
Then swept away
I will carry you my love
If you can carry me
Through this summer of our discontent
Another day away
From clutching hands
Explain to me
How this can be
I will carry you my love
If you can carry me
Through this summer of our discontent
Another falling wave
Upon this crumbling beach
How many more
Until we meet
I will carry you my love
If you can carry me
Through this summer of our discontent <start> Well He walked on the water and He raised up the dead
And we teach all the children that He died for our sin
But somethings gone wrong this worlds in a mess
Jesus is coming and boy is He pissed
Hes looked down at the homeless and the rape of the land
Hes seen the preachers and lawyers with blood on their hands
Politicians beware cause in a loophole youve missed
Jesus is coming and boy is He pissed
In a world gone mad Hes watching it all
And the meek shall inherit but the mighty will fall
Its a shame what weve come to and we cannot go back
And the train bound for glory went down the wrong track
Soon the love in His heart will be the rage in His fist
Jesus is coming and boy is He pissed <start> Every heart has to hurt sometimes
Every lover knows who's ever been left behind
Every time you told me
Every time i believe
It would never be mine
I was just standin' in line
Every heart has to hurt sometimes
I've always been on the other side of goodbye
Handin' out answers to someone else's why
Baby don't wait for me to ask you not to go
Why down inside i know
Every heart has to hurt sometimes
Every lover knows who's ever been left behind
Every time you told me
Every time i believe
It would never be mine

In Cincinnati Ohio Cincinnati Ohio
I guess perhaps the memories got too strong
Grabbed me by the heart strings and pulled me home

At the world I once owned
And I see it's still spinning round

A light I once knew
No longer shines through the clouds
But that's somebody else's moon tonight
Those're somebody else's stars
They're no longer mine
Cause somewhere tonight
You're in somebody else's arms
Remember the wishes
We made in the night
When dreams were supposed to come true
Well I do cause you
Put the stars in my eyes
As you softly promised the moon
That's somebody else's moon tonight
They're no longer mine
Cause somewhere tonight

I once had a mansion and lived in my glory but now I'm down to my last dime
I once had a sweetheart but I was unfaithful yes I've lived a lot in my time
I fought the Grim Reaper down in the dark valley
I prayed when the sun wouldn't shine
I've looked through the bars of a cold lonely prison oh I've lived a lot in my time
I've been a soldier and I've been a rambler I once thought that everything was fine
I've hoed in the cornfield I've picked in the cotton yes I've lived a lot in my time
I've walked with our Master down in the dark valley and wonderful peace I did find
But now some day I'll journey to Eden's green pastures
Oh I've lived a lot in my time I've lived a lot in my time <start> Let's don't go that road it's too late to start a fight

Together we can beat this mean old world
Put your arms around me let me lighten your load
Think of all the love we'd miss

Til a good woman's love made a new man of me
Life had no meaning it was so incomplete
Til a good woman's love put me back on my feet
Still aroamin' I go home in the evening

And I know that no matter what happens
She'll always care
And when night falls and the moon shines above

Tryin' to scratch a livin' from the black land dirt that traded them only with storm
From way before sunup to way up to sundown papa walked behind that ol' mule
Until the day that they laid him away he lived by the golden rule
Black Texas dirt you're full of hurt and you won't geow nothing but weeds
You took my mama and papa it's true but you ain't a gonna get me
 ac.guitar 
Yes sun and the rain well they took everything cept the dirt that would fly in my face
I swore that someday that I'd find me a way to take me away from this place
I packed up my belongings for soon I'd be goin' far off to start a new life
And I'd better hurry or I'd have to worry about those dark clouds in the sky
As I reached the gate and turned to take one last look
At the old homeplace where I was born
I thought I could hear voices callin' to me
But then I thought no that just must be the storm
I couldn't get over the feelin' something was wrong
That I was leavin' something behind
I couldn't put my finger on it but I couldn't get that off my mind
It seemed as if the wind was mama's and papa's voices
And that they were pleading with to stay
And that the rain was tears at the skies were shadding because I was goin' away
But then like a bow of lightnin' from out the blue
Oh that feelings got over me like a flood
And for the very first time in my life I knew I had black Texas dirt in my blood
Black Texas dirt you're full of hurt and you won't geow nothing but weeds
You took my mama and papa it's true and now you're a gonna take me <start> In the stillness of the dawn
Our love is dead and gone
The sunrise warms my heart
With memories of you
It's the sweetest thingremembering
There's a picture in the hall
That I'm leaving on the wall
'Cause there's a look in your eyes
That always made me fall apart
It's the sweetest thingremembering
When I close my eyes to cry
I can't help but feel a smile
'Cause I think of you and I forget
It hurt to say goodbye
But after all we've been through
It's amazing to me
The sweetest thing's remembering
Oh the sweetest thingremembering
We wanted love to last forever
And the good lord knows we tried
But when the rain came pouring down
There was no place left to hide
But after all we've been through
It's amazing to me
The sweetest thing's remembering
Oh the sweetest thingremembering

Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
Don't know why I have to drive so fast
My car has nothing to prove
It's not new
But it'll do zero to sixty in five point two
I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
Can't be late I leave in plenty of time
Shakin' hands with the clock
I can't stop
I'm on a roll and I'm ready to rock
I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
I hear a voice
It says I'm running behind
I better pick up my pace
It's a race and there ain't no room for someone in second place
I'm in a hurry to get things done
I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
I'm in a hurry to get things done
I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
I'm in a hurry to get things done
I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
I'm in a hurry to get things done
I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why <start> The sun is shining but it's still cold
This January is bitter as I've ever known
You're always smiling there's no reason to be
You're always chipper at least that's how it seems
Well Catherine I can't give you anything
Much more than this couple hundred dollar ring
And promises ain't never been my strength
But you are all I'll ever need
You are all I'll ever need
Your hair's a mess clothes don't match
You laugh and say Baby ain't I quite the catch
But all those material things they don't matter anymore
You're mine forever whether we're rich or we're poor
Well Catherine I can't give you anything
Much more than this couple hundred dollar ring
And promises ain't never been my strength
But you are all I'll ever need
You are all I'll ever need
x <start> O Holy Night The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees Oh hear the angel voices
O night divine the night when Christ was born
O night O Holy Night  O night divine
O night O Holy Night  O night divine
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need our weakness is no stranger
Behold your King Before him lowly bend
Behold your King Before him lowly bend
Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord Then ever ever praise we
His power and glory ever more proclaim
His power and glory ever more proclaim <start> My name's in the paper where I took the boy scouts to hike
My hands are all dirty from working on my little boy's bike
The preacher came by and I talked for a minute with him
My wife's in the kitchen and Margie's at the Lincoln Park Inn
And I know why she's there I've been there before
But I made a promise that I wouldn't cheat anymore
I tried to ignore it but I know she's in there my friend
My mind's on a number and Margie's at the Lincoln Park Inn
Next Sunday it's my turn to speak to the young people's class
They expect answers to all of the questions they ask
What would they say if I spoke on a modern day sin
And all of the Margies at all of the Lincoln Park Inns
The bike is all fixed and my little boy is in bed asleep
His little old puppy is curled in a ball at my feet
My wife's baking cookies to feed to the Bridge Club again
I'm almost out of cigarettes and Margie's at the Lincoln Park Inn
 <start> Who can tell just how it starts
Angry words and broken hearts
Till silently we sit apart
You and I
But in awhile the anger's gone
And we forget who's right or wrong
Then one of us will end it all
With just a smile
We believe in happy endings
Never breaking
Only bending
Taking time enough for mending
The hurt inside
We believe in new beginnings
Giving in
And forgiving
We believe happy endings
You and I
Just a word is all it takes
And so it pass
The silence breaks
And looking back it makes us ache
For what we've done
And so we cling together now
And wonder why we're oh so proud
When all that matters anyhow
Is our love
We believe in happy endings
Never breaking
Only bending
Taking time enough for mending
The hurt inside
We believe in new beginnings
Giving in
And forgiving
We believe in happy endings

To see the only one I ever loved
Now the moon is shining bright it lights my pathway tonight
Back to the only one I ever loved
Oh I know she waits for me back in ol' Tennessee
She was sent to me from God above
Now the moon is shining bright it lights my pathway tonight
Back to the only one I ever loved
Oh I know she waits for me back in ol' Tennessee
She was sent to me from God above
Now the moon is shining bright it lights my pathway tonight
Back to the only one I ever loved <start> Her name was Sarah Jean it was a night like this
In front of the Dairy Queen she gave me my first kiss
I was just ten years old so I never knew
She was teaching me how to love you
After the high school dance in my ol' man's car
Holdin' Carol Ann I tried to go too far
When she said No I didn't have a clue
She was teaching me how to love you
Every hand we hold every bridge we burn
Every story told was another lesson learned
A few years ago I met Jill one night
Man I loved her so but I didn't treat her right
When she left me there with my heart broke in two
She was teaching me how to love you
Every hand we hold every bridge we burn
Every single story told is another lesson learned
So if I should glance in your rear view mirror
At every failed romance that brought you here
Honey I can't be hurt by what I see
They were teaching you how to love me
They were teaching you how to love me <start> I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me so
Chorus
You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants boats and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Now Santa is a busy man He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
Chorus
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants boats and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town <start> Levi jacket broken in just right
I left it on the bleachers that Friday night
Felt so cool in the stonewashed fade
There's just some things that can't be replaced
That runaround freedom summer eightynine
Spinnin' that bottle on a lot of first times
It was all summed up on a Memorex mixtape
There's just some things that can't be replaced
Woah it don't matter how hard you try
Woah all the money in the world won't ever buy
What you miss what you want back
It'd be nice but life don't work like that
You can get damn close but it won't ever be the same
There's just some things that can't be replaced
There's just some things that can't be replaced
Sediment hay and a heart of gold
Chevy Cavalier on an old backroad
A boot's farm kiss that I still taste
There's just some things that can't be replaced
Woah no matter how hard you try
Woah all the money in the world won't ever buy
What you miss what you want back
It'd be nice but life don't work like that
You can get damn close but it won't ever be the same
There's just some things that can't be replaced
Woah
For fifteen years right by my side
From a single man to three kids and a wife
Friends come and go but when it comes to Jake
There's just some things that can't be replaced
Woah no matter how hard you try
Woah all the money in the world won't ever buy
What you miss what you want back
It'd be nice but life don't work like that
You can get damn close but it won't ever be the same
There's just some things that can't be replaced
There's just some things that can't be replaced
Woah  <start> Leaning on the old top rail in a big corral
Looking down the twilight trail for my long lost pal
How he sang when he sprang on his old mustang and rode away
Down the track by my shack he said I'll be back another day
Oh the moon is shining pale on a lonesome gal
Leaning on the old top rail in a big corral
Leaning on the old top rail... <start> Some men treat you just like a lady
Others treat you just like a child
And they can drive you so far away
Or they can drive you wild
Some you wanna show to your mama
And some you wouldn't show to your dad
Some wanna take you straight to the altar
And some just wanna take you to bed
Wo men I'm here to tell you about 'em
Men we couldn't make it without 'em
I've loved a few and I've found that a few need a friend
There's nothin' better than men to hold
There's nothin' better than men
Some men are as cold as December
Some are 'bout as hot as July
Sometimes they fill your life with happiness
Sometimes they make you cry <start> Tell me how did you feel when you come out the wilderness
How did you feel when you come out the wilderness
How did you feel when you come out the wilderness
Lean and lonely Lord
Well I felt like shouting when I came out the wilderness
I felt like shouting when I came out the wilderness
I felt like shouting when I came out the wilderness
Lean and lonely Lord
Well I told everybody when I come out the wilderness
I told everybody when I come out the wilderness
I told everybody when I come out the wilderness
Lean and lonely Lord
How did you feel when you come out the wilderness
How did you feel when you come out the wilderness
And how did you feel when you come out the wilderness
Lean and lonely Lord
Well I felt like shouting when I came out the wilderness
I felt like shouting when I came out the wilderness
I felt like shouting when I came out the wilderness
Lean and lonely Lord
Well I told everybody when I come out the wilderness
I told everybody when I come out the wilderness

Lean and lonely Lord <start> 'Zat you Santa Claus
Gifts I'm preparin'
For some Christmas sharin'
But I pause because
Hangin' my stockin'
I can hear a knockin'
'Zat you Santa Claus
Sure is dark out
Not the slighest spark out
Pardon my clackin' jaws
Uh who there
Who is it
Uh stoppin' for a visit
'Zat you Santa Claus
Are you bringin' a present for me
Something pleasantly pleasant for me
That's what I've been waitin' for
Would you mind slippin' it under the door
Four winds are howlin'
Or maybe that be growlin'
My legs feel like straws
Oh my my me my
Kindly would you reply
'Zat you Santa Claus
Yeah
Oh hangin' my stockin'
I can hear a knockin'
'Zat you Santa Claus
Yeah say now
Hey there who is it
Stoppin' for a visit
'Zat you Santa Claus
Whoa there Santa you gave me a scare
Now stop teasin' 'cause I know you're there
We don't believe in no goblins today
But I can't explain why I'm shakin' this way
Well I see old Santa in the keyhole
I'll give to the cause
One peek and I'll try there
Uhoh there's an eye there
'Zat you Santa Claus
Please please
I pity my knees
Say that's you Santa Claus
That's him alright <start> Three silver rings on slim hands waiting
Flash bright in candlelight through Sunday's early morn
We found a room that rainy morning
She took my hand through winding roads and led me home
Some red French wine when later waking
In her warm hideaway she smiled and combed her hair
She laughed each time I asked her name
Made promises to meet again
But her friends down at the French cafe
Had no English words for me
So you may find above the border
A girl with silver rings I never knew her name
You're bound to lose she's too much for you
She'll leave you lost one rainy morn you won't be the same
She laughed each time I asked her name
Made promises to meet again
But her friends down at the French cafe
Had no English words for me <start> Yes your love put a song put a song put a song in my heart
Never have I heard this beautiful music before
Yes your love put a song put a song put a song in my heart
A beautiful song of two people in love evermore
It wasn't too long ago I thought I would never know
What reason has anyone to sing a happy song
I knew only loneliness but then I found happiness
And now I just want the world to smile and sing along
Yes your love put a song...
 guitar 
The meaning of life I find is you in my heart and mind
The meaning that only comes when two hearts beat as one
It's easy to understand once you've given love your hand
And followed through paradise the way that we have done
Yes your love put a song...
Yes your love put a song... <start> I'll be seeing you
Hey don't forget your coat
I'll be seeing you
Feeling like it's turning cold
I hate that your leaving
With so much unsaid
And this strange empty feeling
Won't let me for get that
I'll be seeing you
I'll be seeing you
Oh that beautiful smile
I'll be seeing you
Sure as I'm seeing you now
Around every corner
Where ever I go
Every moment of every day
Darling I know that
I'll be seeing you
I'll be seeing you
Oh the nights I'll cry
But maybe just maybe
In time I'll be fine
I'll be seeing you
When I close my eyes
I'll be seeing you
I've got you memorized
I'll always love you
I know you know that
And I know in my heart
That your not coming back
But in everything I do
I'll be seeing you <start> Down in the valley the valley so low
Late in the evening hear the train blow
Hear the train blow boys oh hear the train blow
Down in the valley hear the train blow
Write me a letter send it by mail
Send it in care of the Birmingham jail

Answer my question will you be mine

Angels in heaven know I love you
Know I love you dear know I love you
Angels in heaven know I love you
Down in the valley the valley so low
Late in the evening hear the train blow <start> The sunlight on my shoulders
The smile on my face
My secret weapon my favorite place
The reason my heart skips a beat
The broom that sweeps me off my feet
A gentle inspiration
My weary soul's salvation
The half that makes me whole
The gravity that grounds me
The arms I want around me
Never letting go
I've lived
I've lived enough
To know what is
And what's not
You areyou are
All the love I want to make
Every breath I want to take
The rush that's running down my spine
The touch that takes me every time
An innocent seduction
Oh I can't get enough and
I can't help but let it show
I lose all my composure
I'm totally exposed and
The reason I let go
Is
I've lived
I've lived enough
I know what is
And what's not
You areyou are
My every hope
My every dream
You are my everything
I've lived yeah
I've lived enough
I know what is
And what's not
You areyou areyou are
The sunlight on my shoulders
The smile on my face
My secret weapon
My favorite place <start> 
Last night I dreamed that I was a child
Out where the pines grow wild and tall
I was trying to make it home through the forest
Before the darkness falls
I heard the wind rustling through the trees
And ghostly voices rose from the fields
I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path
With the devil snappin' at my heels
I broke through the trees and there in the night
My father's house stood shining hard and bright
The branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms
But I ran till I fell shaking in his arms
I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart
Will never again sir tear us from each other's hearts
I got dressed and to that house I did ride
From out on the road I could see it's windows shining in light
I walked up the steps and stood on the porch
A woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door
I told her my story and who I'd come for
She said i'm sorry son but no one by that name lives here anymore
My father's house shines hard and bright
It stands like a beacon calling me in the night
Calling and calling so cold and alone
Shining cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned <start> You never felt this way
Yeah you never fall this far
You never believed in love at first sight
Until tonight when I walked in this bar

She can shop all over town turn the gift
Shops upside down
Finding something for her man with everything
But it's right behind her eyes and no matter what she buys
She'll always be the finest gift she brings
Chorus
Every year it's never missed should be at
The top of every list
It can never be outdoneit's the perfect
Gift for everyone
Verse two
It's in everything you'll see scattered
Underneath our tree
You can hear it in the carols that we sing
It's the heart of love's design and it
Appreciates with time
And she'll always be the finest gift she brings

Verse three
Now it's not in any store and she could
Never give me more
Then her promise of the finest gift she brings
I know her love's the finest gift she brings <start> Mammie delivered me into this world
Mammie watched my mama die at my birth
And Mammie she loved me she took me to raise
Mammie was all I had on this earth
Let's get in the firewood I'd hear Mammie say
Let's go to the spring before it gets dark
And you do up the dishes while the water's still hot
And don't throw that dishwater out in the yard
Oh Mammie taught me how to sing a song
She taught me to play her old guitar
And at night before bedtime we'd sing for hours
As the teakettle whistled along on the fire
And at night as I laid alone in my bed
I'd hear Mammie praying and each night she said
Oh dear God help me raise her to know right from wrong
And I pray she'll do right even after I 'm gone.
I'd wait until Mammie had fallen asleep
Then out of my window I'd quietly sneak
And I'd wait by the mill pond according to plans
And there in the darkness I'd meet a man
Oh it's not that I wanted to bring Mammie shame
I just couldn't control wild blood in my veins
They tell me my mama could not name my dad
So I guess it was natural for me to be bad
One night I awoke at the sound of my name
Come quickly I heard Mammie cry
She said you be good and I told her I would and
That night I watched as my Mammie died
All I have now are the memories of Mammie
And the goodness that loving her brought me
Although she is gone in my heart she lives on
And I know how much good she taught me.
Ah Mammie I'm being good Mammie ... <start> Ironwolf with your storm cold eyes
Are you really as bad as they say
Do you kill your prey for just a sport
Is that the way that you play
Do you run in packs to raise up hell
Do you you terrorize the weak
Does the taste of blood make you evil inside
And at night we hear you speak
Tell me Ironwolf are you really to blame
Or is it man that I described
Tell me Ironwolf are you really that bad
Or is it man's own fears inside
So Ironwolf do you know why
Man wants to hunt you down
If it's not for your coat not for the price
Could it be for somethin' unknown
Well Ironwolf man's got to survive
You seem to be a major threat
Stay hidden in forest run only at night
Or with your own blood you'll be wet
Tell me Ironwolf are you really to blame
Or is it man that I described
Tell me Ironwolf are you really that bad
Or is it man's own fears inside
You're runnin' fast beneath the harvest moon
You're runnin' for your life not knowin' what to do
Tell me Ironwolf are you really to blame
Or is it man that I described
Tell me Ironwolf are you really that bad
Or is it man's own fears inside
Tell me Ironwolf wellare you really to blame
Or is it man that I described
Tell me Ironwolf are you really that bad
Or is it man's own fears inside <start> Chorus
You've got me under your spell again
Sayin' those things again
Makin' me believe that you're just mine
You've got me dreamin' those dreams again
Makin' those things again
I've gotta take you back just one more time
I swore the last time that you let me down
That I wouldn't see you if you came around
But I can't tell my heart what's right or wrong
And I've been so lonely since you've been gone
Chorus
Well everybody tells me that I'm a fool
That I never should have put my faith in you
And way down deep inside I guess I know it's true
But no one else can make me feel the way you do <start> What to do and where to start
Things are falling all apart
Trying hard to move ahead
But keep losing ground instead
Still I have to take a chance
Putting fear and doubt aside
Had no warning in advance
Nothing left to do but try
Chorus
And I just might make it work
I just might make it after all
I just might rise above the hurt
Thought I've suffered quite a fall
But I have to get a grip
And hold on to it like a vice
Have to face the falling chips
I just might make it I just might
Oh I might have been a fool
But its true that love is blind
And you have broken every rule
You've taken all that yours and mine
And How does one go on with life
When your shattered so inside
Pieces of a love gone wrong
Well ya pick'em up and you move along
Chorus
But I just might make it work
I just might make it after all
I just might rise above the hurt
Thought I've suffered quite a fall
I just might live to see the day
I can say hey I'm alright I'm alright I'm alright
I better go on either way
Rise above it I just might be stronger then I know
Well I might even be surprised
I've got to get on with my life
I just might make it
I just might
Nothin left to do but try
I might make it
I just might <start> 
You've all heard tell of Pecos Bill
Who rode a cyclone 'til it broke
Well at the Texas State Fair
There's an even bigger bloke
That cowpoke's name is Big Tex
Fiftytwo feet tall he stands
Outside he's just a mannequin
But inside he's a man
And a man gets lonely
So his heart was full of woe
Until he met a filly
By the name of Heather Jo
So at twilight on the border
As the smoke begins to curl
The heard all loves to hear this story
About Big Tex's girl
All day long she sits beside Big Tex
As he greets the folks at the State Fair
You may say her motives are complex
I think she's just happy sitting there
She grew up in North Dallas full of angst
So she dyes her hair and wears black leather
But now to that angst she says No thanks
Sticking to Tex through the hottest weather
She does not have eyes for the prize roosters
And she's cold toward the reptile boy
Corny dogs don't thrill her like they used to
She only needs Big Tex to bring her joy
Big Tex seems to be a happy fella
But his loneliness she recognized
Searching for a tattooed mademoiselle
Not afraid to love a man his size
All her friends in school were nonconformists
So she became a nonconformist too
But the change inside her was enormous
When Big Tex said Je t'aime mon petit chou
She's not lost inside the House of Mirrors
She no longer rides the TiltaWhirl
Midway barkers cannot draw her nearer
She just wants to be Big Tex's girl
Howdy folks. Welcome to the State Fair of Texas
She hears him saying
Heather Jo I love you though small minds reject us
Toast them with a giant Dr. Pepper
Hoist your turkey legs into the air
To the love birds of two different feathers
And their big romance at the State Fair
You might say that their love has no future
The crowd around his feet may taunt and tease
But pardner don't you try to disabuse her
'Cause she's just happy as Big Tex's squeeze <start> Way up in the north in old Tyrone
There's a pretty little girl I call my own
She's the sweetest rose Ireland's ever grown
And sure as the moon and stars above
I'm falling head over heels in love
With a pretty little girl from Omagh
In the county of Tyrone.
There's cute little girls in old Strabane
They're just as pretty in Monaghan
This to every roving eye is known
But I guess that I'd be out of bounds
'Cos there between the northern towns
There's a pretty little girl from Omagh
In the county of Tyrone.
She wears my ring and tells her friends
She going to marry me
Best of all she tells them all
She's going to marry me oh lucky me.
Well I don't know what she's done to me
There's nothing else my eyes can see
My pretty little girl from Omagh
In the county of Tyrone.
 Instrumental 
T'was down in south in old Tramore
I recall the yellow dress she wore
She strolled along the shore there all alone
But I guess it was my lucky day
When she came there on holiday
My pretty little girl from Omagh
In the county of Tyrone.
She wears my ring and tells her friends
She going to marry me
Best of all she tells them all
She's going to marry me oh lucky me.
Well I don't know what she's done to me
There's nothing else my eyes can see
My pretty little girl from Omagh
In the county of Tyrone.
My pretty little girl from Omagh
In the county of Tyrone... <start> Please help me I'm falling in love with you
Close the door to temptation don't let me walk through
Turn away from me darling I'm begging you to
Please help me I'm falling in love with you
I belong to another whose arms have grown cold
I promised forever to have and to hold
I can never be free dear but when I'm with you
I know that I'm losing the will to be true
Please help me I'm falling in love with you
Close the door to temptation don't let me walk through
Turn away from me darling I'm begging you to
Please help me I'm falling in love with you
Please help me I'm falling in love with you <start> Back in my arms again back in my dreams again back to this lonely world of mine
No need to call for me just come on home to me you know you're welcome anytime
I guess it wasn't in the cards where our love to go on
I found you had another on your mind
But if your deal don't work out the way you think it should
Come on home you're welcome anytime
Back in my arms again...
 steel 
Well I've heard that your new love is not the love you've planned
You call me to say you change your mind
If you were just another girl I wouldn't care at all
But I love you so you're welcome anytime
Back in my arms again... <start> Well everybody everybody who has reached out so far to me
Well never did we ever think that these were desperate times or misery
And they softly spoke of how it's supposed to be
Never did I think that I was so naive
So please let me be lonely tonight
For how many times I thought this was the life
But I'm not so sure I even am alive
Well I've torn apart and warded off nearly every lover every friend
Every smile was so delicate floated around until the nights would end
And I'd wander off and then I'd find a bed
With the thought of her still dancing 'round my head
So please let me be lonely tonight
How many times I thought that you were right
But I knew that they were all Little White Lies
Oh
You have my heart so take my money too
Look at how I've gone and made myself a fool
I couldn't please you you never believed that I was true
So darlin' oh darlin' please let me forget about you Oh
So please let me be lonely tonight
You know that I don't want to have to yell or fight
No I'm not the one to judge what's wrong and right
So please let me be lonely tonight
Oh I know that in your heart you'll be just fine
So forget you ever looked into my eyes <start> FROM A JACK TO A KING
WRITER NED MILLER
From a jack to a king from loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen and walked away with your heart
From a jack to a king with no regrets I stackled the cards last night
And Lady Luck played her hand just right to make me king of your heart
For just a little while I thought that I might lose the game
Then just in time I saw the twinkle in your eye
From a jack to a king from loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen you made me king of your heart
 guitar 
For just a little while I thought... <start> Some people say I drink because you left me
And they say that wine won't drown your memory
But the reason that I drink is not to get you off my mind
I just heard this was a good year for the wine
It doesn't bother me now that you're gone and I haven't thought about you in so long
And I'm not in this honky tonk cause you're no longer mine
I just heard this was a good year for the wine
 steel 
It's not the neon lights that drove me to this tavern
All the lonely sound you're running to inside
It's not my losing you that keeps me drinking all the time
I just heard this was a good year for the wine
It doesn't bother me now...
I just heard this was a good year for the wine <start> I can wait for the train to come in sight cause my baby's comin' home tonight
I'll be standing in this rain and I'll meet the midnight train
That will bring my baby home tonight
I can hear a whistle down the line Mr Engeneer be on time
It's so cold in this rain but my baby's on your train
It'll be good to have my baby home tonight
 ac.guitar  harmonica 
I can see her stepping out the door I can wait to kiss her lips once more
But who is that man that is holding her hand
And says it's good to have my baby home tonight
Oh yes it's good to have my baby home tonight
I know it's good to have my baby home tonight <start> Sometimes I hear a woman cryin
And a man sayin nothin at all
Often I hear children laughin
And footsteps walkin down the hall
There's a ghost for every memory
Always remindin me that I was wrong
And since her leavin
I've been sleepin
Leavin all of the lights on

What was once a happy home
Feels more like a haunted house
Haunted by the sounds of broken hearts
Rattlin off the chain of broken vows
It sends a chill through my bones
It's got me scared as a mouse
Now empty and alone
What was once a happy home
Feels more like a haunted house
There's no place to run and hide
I swear she's everywhere I go
In every room I smell her perfume
I know she's not here
But I'm not alone

It sends a chill through my bones
It's got me scared as a mouse
Now empty and alone
What was once a happy home
Feels more like a haunted house <start> I've got a sad sad story friend that I don't like to tell
I had a home and fam'ly when they locked me in this cell
I've been here eighteen years that's a long long time I know
But time don't mean a thing to me cause I've got life to go
Well I went one night where the lights were bright just to see what I could see
I met up with an old friend who's thought the world of me
He bought me drinks and he took me to every honky tonk in town
Words were said and now he's dead I just had to bring him down
Well it's been a long long time now since I've heard from my wife
Guess I'll be there with her yet if I hadn't used the knife
Well I'll bet that little girl of mine don't realize or know
Her daddy's been here eighteen years still got life to go
Well I'll bet there's not one man outside that's spent this long in jail
I'll be here in this prison till my body's just a shell
No I can't be free to go and see the ones that I love so
I've been here eighteen years still got life to go <start> VERSE 
I sit here surrounded by nothin but failure
My bottles empty but I still crave more
I hear what youre saying not sure that Im listenin
Theres no denying Im losing the war
CHORUS
Cause Im not the man that you married
And you cant turn water to wine
I want you to be happy so walk out the door
Theres no denying Im losing the war
VERSE 
I wish that I had thought before I had spoken
My eyes are swollen my mouth is dry
I wish that I could tell you I could give it up for you
But theres no denying Im losing the war
CHORUS
VERSE 
Off in the distance Im sure I see an angel
Her words are broken so are her wings
Eyes closed and dancing on top of the bar
Theres no denying Im losing the war
CHORUS
I want you to be happy so walk out the door
Theres no denying Im losing this war <start> When I was a boy my family would travel
Down to western Kentucky where my parents were born
To a lost little town there that's all but remembered
So many times that my memories are worn.
Chorus
And Daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
He said I'm sorry my son but you're too late in asking
Mr. Peabodys coal train has hauled it away.
Well sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Aidrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot our pistols
Oh but empty pop bottles is all we would kill.
Chorus
Well the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
They tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Lord they dug for their coal till the ground was forsaken
And wrote it all down as the Progress of man.
Chorus
When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester Dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just  miles away from wherever I am <start> To my sorrow I loved you only cause you told me your heart was true
Then you left me to love another to my sorrow I trusted you
Only time can heal this longing in my heart dear
And somebody else may help me to forget
I should hate you for all these heartaches
But to my sorrow I love you yet
 steel 
To my sorrow you made a vow dear and you promised to never go
Now your promise and vows are broken why I love you I'll never know
Maybe someday when your head has turned to silver
You'll be sorry that you said we had to part
Though I'm smiling inside I'm crying
Cause to my sorrow you're in my heart <start> It's been a long time coming
As you shed a lonesome tear
And now you're in a wonderama
I wonder what you're doing here
The flame no longer flickers
You're feeling just like a fool
You keep staring into your liquor
Wondering what to do
I don't hardly know you
But I'd be willing to show you
I know a way to make you smile
Let me touch you for a while
I'm gonna ruin my black mascara
You're drinking whisky when it should be wine
You keep looking into that mirror
But to me you're looking really fine
I don't hardly know you
But I'd be willing to show you
I know a way to make you
Laugh at that cowgirl as she's walking out your door
I know a way to make you smile
Just let me whisper things you've never heard before
Just let me touch you baby
Just let me touch you for a while
I don't hardly know you
But I'd be willing to show you
I know a way to make you smile
It's been a long time
Let me touch you for a while <start> Dig dig a little deeper in the well boys
Dig a little deeper in the well
If you want a good cool drink of water
You gotta dig a little deeper in the well.
My daddy used to tell me don't be fooled by what you see
If you want to get to the heart of things you gotta look way down deep
Second place don't get it son winners got to come in first
There's nothin' worse than to take a drink that leaves you with a thirst
A good man needs a good womanshe's the rock that'll make him strong
Now she'll be there to lean on when the whole world's done him wrong
Ain't nothin' like good lovin' that's how it's meant to be
Find yourself a good woman son like your mama's been to me.
The mighty river's flowin' where the water's cool and sweet
Don't be fooled by a muddy dream be careful when you drink
Life is what you make it sometimes a livin' hell
If you want to find that promised land dig a little deeper in the well <start> Oh holy night The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appear'd and the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees Oh hear the angels voices
O night divine O night when Christ was born
O night divine O night O night divine.
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by his cradle we stand.
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here come the wise men from the orient land.
The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend.
He knows our need to our weakness is no stranger.
Behold your King Before Him lowly bend
Behold your King Your King Before Him bend.

Christ is our Savior He's our King
Praise Him ever more
Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord O praise His name forever
His pow'r and glory ever more proclaim
His pow'r and glory ever more proclaim <start> YOU TOOK THE EASY WAY OUT

' Tree Publishing
You said our love was not the same and that I was all to blame
You took the easy way out
And though I loved you heart and soul that's not the story that you told
You took the easy way out
You came home while I was gone packed your things and moved along
You took the easy way out
Left me alone to explain to our friends and bear the shame
While you took the easy way out
You came home while I was gone... <start>  duet with Ray Price 
They call me a fool and say it won't last
That you'll break my heart like the ones in your past
They're calling you wild you'll never be true but I call it heaven just being with you
Perhaps I should listen perhaps I'm not smart
But I take my chances and fallow my heart
They call this a game you'll leave me some day but I call it heaven don't take it away

Perhaps I should listen... <start> Almost heaven West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains
Shenandoah River.
Life is old there
Older than the trees
Younger than the mountains
Growing like a breeze.
Chorus
Country roads take me home
To the place where I belong
West Virginia mountain mom
Take me home country roads.
All my memories gathered 'round her
Miner's lady stranger to blue water.
Dark and dusty painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine
Teardrop in my eye.
Chorus
I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me
Radio reminds me of my home far away
And driving down the road I get a feeling
I should have been home yesterday yesterday
Chorus <start> It's such a pretty world today I look at the sunshine

And every day's the same since I met you
It's such a pretty world today knowing that you're mine

And happiness is being close to you
And though the rain may fall our skies will all be blue
If I look close enough the sun will come shining through
It's such a pretty world today look at the sunshine

Today and every day since I met you

And every day's the same since I met you

And happiness is being close to you
And though the rain may fall our skies will all be blue
If I look close enough the sun will come shining through
It's such a pretty world today look at the sunshine

Today and every day since I met you

Today and every day since I met you <start> As I look at the letters that you wrote to me
It's you that I'm thinking of
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love
I miss you darling more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded love
I think of the past and all the pleasures we had
As I watch the mating of the dove
It was in the springtime that you said Goodbye
I remember our faded love
I miss you darling more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded love
And remember our faded love <start> No one can cry like a woman can it's been that way since time began
No one on earth is lonelier than a lonely woman
Her life without love is like a rose that wilts and dies when her lover goes
You're listening to someone who really knows a lonely woman
No one can cry like a woman...
Is this my heart or drums that began for only the sounds of the world closin' in
When I remember how long I have been a lonely woman
No one can cry like a woman... <start> There's no room in my heart for the blues
Love is satisfied to either win or lose
Darling if our pathway parts let's that be no broken hearts
There's no room in my heart for the blues
There's no room in my memory for tears
We left back on and be forgotten souvenirs
If your hungry heart forgets let there be no sad regrets
There's no room in my heart for the blues
There's no room in my life for a sigh
We'll be strong enough to face our last goodbye
Darling when our romance ends let us part as best of friends
There's no room in my heart for the blues
There's no room in my heart for the blues
Love is satisfied to either win or lose
Darling if our pathway parts let's that be no broken hearts
There's no room in my heart for the blues <start> We're not strong enough to bend
We're not strong enough to say we can forgive
We're not brave enough to fall
Oh and we're not big enough to risk it all
But love is love is
It's always been it always will be
We may not be perfect
But love is
We can't resist another fling
We're not able to live above the bling
But love is love is
It's always been it always will be
We may not be perfect
But love is
We may not be ready
Anywhere close to a start
But wherever we are
Love is
It's always been it always will be
I may not be perfect
But love is
Hey love is
Love is <start> Sing the wondrous love of Jesus
Sing his mercy and his grace
In the mansions bright and blessed
He'll prepare for us a place
Chorus
When we all get to heaven
What a day of rejoicing that will be
When we all see Jesus
We'll sing and shout the victory
While we walk the pilgrim pathway
Clouds will overspread the sky
But when travlin' days are over
Not a shadow not a sigh
Chorus
Onward to the prize before us
Soon his beauty we'll behold
Soon the pearly gates will open
We shall tread the streets of gold
Chorus <start> I have a tendency
To laugh at all the wrong moments
Sometimes I forget
The words to my own songs
I'm not the silent type
Or an exit sign or a yellow brick road
But you are the one thing that I know
It's in the wine we drink
Dirty dishes in the kitchen sink
When the lights go out
Till the sun comes out
We are not alone
It's in the miles we drive
Never having to say goodbye
It's the things we tell each other
Without saying a word
You are the one thing that I know
There's a beauty that we never know
What the future holds
Beneath the surface
We are the calm we are the storm
I'm not a sunset or a hurricane
Or a Vincent van Gogh
You are the one thing that I know
It's in the wine we drink
Dirty dishes in the kitchen sink
When the lights go out
Till the sun comes out
We are not alone
It's in the miles we drive
Never having to say goodbye
It's the things we tell each other
Without saying a word
You are the one thing that I know
It's in the wine we drink
Dirty dishes in the kitchen sink
When the lights go out
Till the sun comes out
We are not alone
You are the one thing that I know <start> Sing choir of angels
Sing through the night
I'll be still
I'll be quiet
They took my body
They robbed me blind
There's no turning back now
No use in crying
Every lonely road is behind me
That led me through the changes I don't feel
And I lost sight of flesh and bone
Little I knew I was going home
Sing choir of angels
Sing me to sleep
Sing soft and sweet
I'm yours to keep
I fought their battles
and I gave my life
For peace and quiet
For pain and strife
Now every lonely road is behind me
That led me through the changes I don't feel
And I lost sight of flesh and bone
Little I knew I was going home <start> I know thats what a mans supposed to do.
But sometimes youre so tired when you get home
Youre not much fun to talk to.
Saturdays you kick that old lawn mower till it starts.
Then patiently you turn it off and on
Dodgin' toys in the back yard.
You smile when you pass the kitchen window.
And I I think youre beautiful.
My world would be an empty place
Without your touch without your face.
And I see the man you are
An' everything you want to be
And how you love the things
That mean the most to me
I think youre beautiful.
You dont mind
When my sister calls me every Friday night
About the time we turn the movie on
Just to talk about her love life.
And your little boy says one day hell drink coffee just like you.
You say it makes you better knowing he
Watches everything that you do.
Sometimes you dont understand me but you try and
And I think youre beautiful.
My world would be an empty place
Without your touch without your face.
And I see the man you are
An' everything you want to be
And how you love the things
That mean the most to me
I think youre beautiful.
Instrumental break.
And Im not sure why I deserve this life.
But Im so thankful that its mine.
I think youre beautiful.
My world would be an empty place
Without your touch without your face.
And I see the man you are
And everything you want to be
And how you love the things
That mean the most to me
I think youre beautiful.
I think youre beautiful. 
Beautiful. <start> Where the Mississippi's flowing on the sunny southern shores
And the steamboat comes apuffing round the bend
There's a little old log cabin with a grape vine over the door
And a little whitewashed chimney at the end
I'm going back I'm going back to the place I love so well
To the folks who want me for their very own
To the little old log cabin with the grape vine o'er the door
And a little whitewashed chimney at the end
I went away up North where they told me I would find
Money hanging 'round like apples on a tree
It was there my sweetheart told me it was nothing of the kind
And the weather was so cold I thought I'd freeze
I'm going back I'm going back to the place I love so well
To the folks who want me for their very own
To the little old log cabin with the grape vine o'er the door
And a little whitewashed chimney at the end
I can see the smoke arising from the little chimney top
As it welcomes me and greets me on the breeze
It's then I'll start to running and I know I'll never stop
Till I've landed in that cabin on my knees
I'm going back I'm going back to the place I love so well
To the folks who want me for their very own
To the little old log cabin with the grape vine o'er the door
And a little whitewashed chimney at the end <start> Dreamin' is only dreamin'
'Til dreamin' is the only thing that's true
Yeah wishin' is only wishin'
Till my only thoughts' the wish to be with you
I've got a long way to go before I get there
I've got a lot of field to hoe with the sun so high
Got a lot of miles to roll
And the next few only show
That there is still such a long way to go
Hopin' doesn't feel like hopin'
If I can feel your heart hopin' too
Oh touchin' doesn't feel like touchin'
Until I feel the next touch from you
I've got a long way to go before I get there
I've got a lot of field to hoe with the sun so high
I've got a lot of miles to roll
And the next few only show
That there is still such a long way to go
Wanting just keeps me wanting
The next and last both keep me wanting you
Oh and waiting just keeps me waiting
Until there's no more waiting left to do
I've got a long way to go before I get there
I've got a lot of field to hoe with the sun so high
I've got a lot of miles to roll
And the next few only show
That there's still such a long way to go
Oh I've got a lot of miles to roll
And the next few only show
That there's still such a long way to go <start> I walk in on Friday nights
Same old bar same burned out lights
Same people and all the same faces
So why in the hell does it feel like a different place
Meet my friends for a girls' night out
Seems there ain't much to talk about
Same drinks that we're all raising
But all of the toasts just don't feel the same
We used to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts but it's true
When they think of me they think of you
They keep asking how I am
But they're really asking where you've been
I can read between all of the lines
It ain't just us missing all of the times
We were to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts but it's true
When they think of me they think of you
Ain't it funny how a flame like that
Oh whoa when they think of you
It can burn when it's in the past
We used to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts but it's true
When they think of me they think of you
Oh they think of you
When they think of me
Baby baby oh
When they think of me they think of you <start> Well it really has been nice bein' with you
But I'm afraid that I've got to leave
As you know I'm a rodeo cowboy
And there's a rodeo down in Mesquite
That's the life of a rodeo cowboy breakin' broncs or gettin' broke
That's the life of a rodeo cowboy and that's the only life I know
On the day you think your day is the big one
I'm walkin' away with all that they own
Then you're lyin' hurtin' hearin' someone saying
Give him a hand that's all that cowboy is taking home
Hot beer and cold stale hamburgers
Makes a meal sorta hard to enjoy
And it kinda makes you think of momma's chicken
Ah that's the life of a rodeo cowboy
That's the life of a rodeo cowboy
When you're down and you're really feeling sorry
Well you go for a drink in some bar
Then someone points at you
And you hear him whisper over there stands a rodeo star
That's the life of a rodeo cowboy
That's the life of a rodeo cowboy <start> Hit the snooze when the 'larm clock rings
Layin' there doin' that sleepy head thing
There's a bird out my window spreadin' his wings
Cheap chirp doin' that sing in'
Thing I do when I first get up
Is the coffee thing in my favorite cup
Or two gets me goin' got things to do
Let me tell you a thing or two
Ev'rything's a thing if you know what I mean
You can't do nothin' 'cause there's no such thing
Some things are big some things are small
Some mean a lot some nothin' at all
It's all laid out in the scheme of things
No matter what it is ev'rything's a thing
Off to work in my old mustang
Doin' that bumper to bumper thing
Up ahead aringalingdingding
Some guy's doin' that cell phone thing
As the light turns green
And he ain't doin' that drivin' thing
The thing is about all this
That talkin' thing and drivin' don't mix
Ev'rything's a thing if you know what I mean
You can't do nothin' 'cause there's no such thing
Some things are big some things are small
Some mean a lot some nothin' at all
It's all laid out in the scheme of things
No matter what it is ev'rything's a thing
If you think this song ain't worth hummin'
You got another thing comin'
'cause ev'rything's a thing if you know what I mean
You can't do nothin' 'cause there's no such thing
Some things are big some things are small
Some mean a lot some nothin' at all
It's all laid out in the scheme of things
No matter what it is ev'rything's a thing

And we only reach that shore by faith you see
Yes i want to see my jesus
Shake his hand and have him great us
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
Don't you hear the bells aringin'
Can't you hear the angels singin'
It's a glory hallelujah jubilee
In the far off great forever just beyond the shining river
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
When our days have known their number
When in death we sweetly slumber
When the kingdom mends the spirit to be free
There'll be no more stormy weather
We'll live peacefully together
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
Don't you hear the bells aringin'
Can't you hear the angels singin'
It's a glory hallelujah jubilee
In the far off great forever just beyond the shining river
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
When they ring those golden bells for you and me <start> I remember how you stuck your hand in mine
Where we were on the boardwalk
When I stuck that five in a jar
For the tikibar band to play
Gettin' stuck with you in that photo booth
We stuck that picture in a bottle
I bet it's probably still floatin' down there in the Chesapeake bay
Yeah that's a hell of a memory we made
'Cause you're still stuck in my head like the song they played
That night when the cool Virginia beach rain
Soaked us both down to the bone yeah but we just kept on dancin'
Your shirt stuck to your skin I was stuck to you
All night long baby barely kept my cool cause I never wanted anybody else that much
That's where I'm still stuck stuck stuck stuck stuck
Yeah that's where I'm still Stuck stuck stuck stuck stuck
Stuck your bag in that taxi cab
When that week was all over
My heart stuck in my throat
When you got inside and left
I stood there tasting that last kiss
You stuck your hand out the window
And gave me that little goodbye wave
And no I never will forget girl I still wonder if
I'm still stuck in your head like that song they played
That night when the cool Virginia beach rain
Soaked us both down to the bone yeah but we just kept on dancin'
Your shirt stuck to your skin I was stuck to you
All night long baby barely kept my cool cause I never wanted anybody else that much
That's where I'm still stuck
Yeah you're still stuck in my head like the song they played
That night when the cool Virginia beach rain
Soaked us both down to the bone yeah but we just kept on dancin'
Your shirt stuck to your skin I was stuck to you
All night long baby barely kept my cool cause I never wanted anybody else that much
That's where I'm still Stuck stuck stuck stuck stuck
Yes I am girl that's where I'm still stuck stuck stuck stuck stuck
Right where you left me baby stuck stuck stuck stuck stuck
That's where I'm still stuck stuck stuck stuck stuck <start> Skaggs Ricky

Country Boy

I may look like a city slicker shinin' up through my shoes
But underneath I'm just a cotton picker pickin' up the messy blues
CHORUS
Show me where I start
Find a horse  cart
I'm just a country boy country boy at heart
I may look like a bank teller pushing facts in a file
But I'd rather be a haul collar shooing foot home on the style <start> In the hills of Georgia at a modest home
Lived a sugaredup beauty queen garden gnome

Shes sing a song whistle a tune
Make ketchup sgetty with her momma June

Yeha
Shes roaming the country shes on the loose
Filled with balls of cheese and gogo juice

Yeha
Shes fighting for justice and the American way
From the mountainto she screams everybodys a little gay
Thats right
An American hero down to the core
She eats her meals right off the floor

This is the ballad of Honey Boo Boo <start> Once I had myself a good woman
But I just didn't treat her right
I was always leaving
Livin' a party life
True love was waiting for me
I was much too blind to see
Till she told me she would leave me
I said that's all right with me
Oh now she's gone
Realize I lost the best thing there is
And my pride keeps telling me
Let your loss be your lesson
Heaven knows I miss her lovin'
Heaven knows how much I cry
Just to think she had left me
And I know the reason why
I could tell she had been cryin'
It didn't seem to bother me
Cause I know there's no one blinder
Than a fool who just couldn't see <start> I've got you on my mind again you've been there since I don't know when
I said that I'd forget that I'd never look back
That I'd find somebody else so little further down the track
But that same old hurt is back once more it's here since you walked out the door
And as the long day ends and the lonely night begins I've got you on my mind again
Well I said that you'd be out of mind when you've got out of sight
That there'd never be one lonely moment or one sleepless night
But lately I've been finding out just what a heartache means
For every time I close my eyes I see you in my dreams
And I've got you on my mind again...
I've got you on my mind again <start> You're out there among the stars
It never will seem right
If I could get to where you are
I'd be there tonight
Were you just a dream I had
How am I to know
I can't hold you in my arms
And I can't let you go
Higher mountains
Deeper valleys
Longer rivers
Stand between us now
I could climb that jagged peak
I could cross that great divide
If I knew that you'd be waiting
For me on the other side
The days pass by my window now
Oh but nights like these are rough
I can feel you in my heart
But that's not close enough
If I could hear you breathe again
The comfort of your sigh
I'd gladly trade tomorrow in
On one more last goodbye
Higher mountains
Deeper valleys
Longer rivers
Stand between us now
When I rise above the seas

And the Firmaments collide

When I pass through Heaven's gateway
Let me enter as your bride

Bluebonnets in my hair

That you'll gather for me there
You're out there among the stars <start> No rush though I need your touch
I won't rush your heart
Until you feel on solid ground
Until your strength is found girl
I'll fill those canyons in your soul
Like a river lead you home
And I'll walk a step behind
In the shadows so you shine
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm the one
Somebody else was here before
He treated you unkind
And broken wings need time to heal
Before a heart can fly girl
I'll fill those canyons in your soul
Like a river lead you home
And I'll walk a step behind
In the shadows so you shine
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm the one
Trust in me and you'll find a heart so true
All I want to do is give the best of me to you
And stand beside you
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm the one <start> I've been humbled by the Glory and the power of his love
When I've stumbled and I've fallen he's been there to pick me up
In the face of all temptation been the strength to stand my ground
Wrapped in His sweet salvation I know I'm Glorybound
I'm a man I'm not an angel
Oh I've got no wings to fly
But I'll make it up to Heaven
One step at a time
I've cried tears of jealous sorrow I have tasted bitter wine
Lost faith in my tomorrow and I've cursed the hands of time
I wandered through the darkness surrendered to my doubts
I've been so close to Hell I've could hear the devil shout
I'm a man I'm not an angel
Oh I've got no wings to fly
But I'll make it up to Heaven
One step at a time oh yeah
When all the clouds have parted and I lie face to face with death
I won't fear the darkness in the grasp of my last breath
I climb that mighty stairway that leads to Heaven's gate
The surrender of my soul will be my final leap of faith
I'm a man I'm not an angel
Oh I've got no wings to fly
But I'll make it up to Heaven
One step at a time
Oh I'm a man I'm not an angel
Oh I've got no wings to fly
But I'll make it up to Heaven
One step at a time
One step at a time
I said one step at a time <start> My darlin come to me
Sit you down easily
And rest awhile
Near the soft fire light
Cold as the night
But warm is my heart with pride
Having you by my side
You're still my guiding light
After all these years
Your soft assuring ways
The rock I lean on
Saw me through my darkest days
When all hope had gone
You're still the only one
I'll ever hold near
And I still love you
After all these years
Time from me passes on
And I'm growing old
A lifetime nearly gone
I cannot unfold
Night dark and cold
But warm is your hand in mine
Feeble with ageless time
The light of love still shines
After all these years
Your soft assuring ways
The rock I lean on
Saw me through my darkest days
When all hope had gone
You're still the only one
I'll ever hold near
And I still love you
After all these years
I still love you
After all these years <start> Play me a sad song
Tell me your woman's gone
You know how misery loves company
Sing it just one more time
Before I lose my mind
Tell me how misery loves company
Loneliness surrounds me
Emptiness you found me
I don't think I can go on
Sing me a drinking song
Tell me you done her wrong
You know how misery loves company
I'll put in my last dime
To hear it one more time
Willie sing Misery Loves Company
Loneliness surrounds me
Emptiness you found me
I don't think I can go on
I don't think I can go on
I don't think I can go on <start> Yes you're the hardest part of livin's loving me
Must be thousands of good reasons that I may never see
Still you keep that candle burnin' let me live there in your dreams
You're the reasons for tomorrow you're the sunshine morning brings
I've got friends in lots of places and I'm quick to call their names
And I know you've got a lotta friends and you could do the same
I've got answers to that problem solutions they can't see
But you're hardest part of livin's loving me
I've got feelings for the man who's down and it hurts to see his pain
And I know that when you cry at night those tears like falling rain
But it's crying tears of hoping for the things you prayed to be
And you're hardest part of livin's loving me
Yes you're the hardest part...
You're the reasons for tomorrow you're the sunshine morning bring <start> Talk to him everyday
Even though he's ohsofar away
And every night I lay in bed
And hug the pillow where he laid his head
And in my dreams I drift back to that high school kiss
And the night he put his class ring on my hand
I see our wedding day and it takes my breath away
Once again like it did back then
I'm living on the love her left me
And he gave me so much love in such a little time
And that kind of love is hard to find
One day we'll meet again in that sweet byandby
But till we're back together
I'm living on the love he left behind
Our little boy down the hall
Is trying to teach me how to play baseball
Yesterday I got choked up
When he said Mommy You use daddy's glove
I turned down a thousand bucks
For his old pickup truck
I'm hangin' on to everything that's part of him
I'll hold him in my heart
Till I can hold him in my arms
Once again
But till then
I'm living on the love her left me
And he gave me so much love in such a little time
And that kind of love is hard to find
One day we'll meet again in that sweet byandby
But till we're back together
I'm living on the love he left behind <start> I was headed north on Highway Five
On a starlit Sunday night
When a pickup truck flew by me out of control
As I watched in my headlights
He swerved left then back right
He never hit the brakes
As he left the road
I found him lying in the grass
Among the steel and glass
With an empty whiskey bottle by his side
And through the blood and tears
He whispered in my ear
A few last words just before he died
Don't tell Mama I was drinkin'
Lord knows her soul would never rest
I can't leave this world with Mama thinkin'
I met the Lord with whiskey on my breath
I still think about that night
And how that young man died
And how others sometimes pay for our mistakes
The last thing on his mind
As he left this world behind
Was knowing someone else's heart would break
Don't tell Mama I was drinkin'
Lord knows her soul would never rest
I can't leave this world with Mama thinkin'
I met the Lord with whiskey on my breath
Don't tell Mama I was drinkin' <start> I've laid around and played around this old town too long
Summer's almost gone winter's comin' on
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
High sheriff and police are ridin' after me
Ridin' after me oh they're ridin' after me
High sheriff and police are ridin' after me
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
Papa writes to Johnny Johnny can't come home
No Johnny can't come home Johnny can't come home
Papa writes to Johnny but Johnny can't come home
'Cause he's been on that chain gang too long
Gotta see my baby gotta see her bad
Gotta see her bad oh I gotta see her bad
Gotta see my baby gotta see her bad
She's the best friend this poor boy ever had
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
Summer's almost gone winter's comin' on
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
Oh I feel like I've gotta travel on
Oh I feel like I've gotta travel on <start> In every other song that I've heard lately some fellow get shot
And his baby and his best friend both died with him as likely as nut
In half of the other songs some cat's cryin' are ready to die
We've lost most all of our happy people and I'm a wonderin' why
Let's think about livin' let's think about lovin'
Let's think about hoopin' and a hopin' and a poppin' and a lovey dovey dovin'
Let's forget about a whinnin' and a cryin' and a shootin' and a dyin'
And a fellow with a switchblade knife
Let's think about livin' let's think about life
 guitar 
Well we lost ol' Marty Robbins back in El Paso a little while back
And now Miss Mary John or one of them girls they're wearin' black
Cathy's Clown's got Don and Phil so lonesome they could die
If we keep on losin' our singers like that I'll be the only one you can buy
Let's think about livin'...
Let's think about livin'...
Let's think about livin' let's think about life <start> It's a big estate with wrought iron gates
And palm trees standin' tall
And fancy mirrors and chandeliers
Comfort wall to wall
And the ocean air is so crisp and clear
And they rave about our view
But there ain't no mountain breeze
And there ain't no hickory trees
And this ain't Tennessee and she ain't you
There's a bedroom suite where she comes to me
And as her fingers touch my face
I close my eyes and I fantasize
Another time and place
What she feels is so warm and real
And I know her love is true
And she tries so hard to please
Still I think sometimes she sees
That this ain't Tennessee and she ain't you
It's not that it's not grand enough
And it's not that I'm not man enough
There's just somethin' easy goin' that I love
About you and Tennessee
So I made up my mind to learn my lines
And try to play the part
But part of me is in Tennessee
And deep down in my heart
I miss my smoky mountain home and I miss your lovin' too
And it's deep inside of me and it's always gonna be
'Cause this ain't Tennessee and she ain't you <start> Hey there baby what do you say
There's a look in your eyes lookin' my way
Castin' your stare my way all night
Got a crazy idea I think you'd like
Hey sweet sugar in her sexy boots
How 'bout a drive down the avenue
Thinkin' about a new tattoo
I'd love to see my name in ink on you
Let's go rockin' 'til the sun comes up
Talkin' forever ain't enough
Fallin' in the moonlight love
Keep on fallin' when the sun comes up yeah
Oh I got a real fast jet black Pontiac
Enough cash in a suitcase to never come back
Been thinkin' 'bout flying down to paradise
It won't be the same if you're not by my side
Rockin' 'til the sun comes up
Talkin' forever ain't enough
Fallin' in the moonlight love
Keep on fallin' when the sun comes up yeah
Oh yeah 
Keep on fallin' 'til you just let go
Keep on fallin' baby here we go
Rockin' 'til the sun comes up
Talkin' forever ain't enough
Fallin' fallin' in the moonlight love
Keep on fallin' when the sun comes up
Rockin' 'til the sun comes up
Talkin' forever ain't enough
Fallin' fallin' in the moonlight love
Keep on fallin' when the sun comes up yeah
 When the sun comes up
 When the sun comes up
 C'mon c'mon baby baby
 When the sun comes up yeah <start> Standin on the corner
Watchin all the girls go by
Drinkin wine and whiskey
Smokin joints and stayin high
I was young and crazy
And I never thought that I could die
Ch ' Cadillac ' Chevorlet
Going thru the gravel
Till it brings you to the break of day
Smokin in the boys room
Lookin for some chick to lay
I was young and crazy
And life was full of girls and beer
Now I'm getting older but
I'm still crazy after all these years
All these years
Lookin at the strippers
Hangin in the titty bars
Life was Jim Bean Whiskey
Naked chicks and fancy cars
I thought I was bullet proof
I was reachin for the stars
Repeat Chorus <start> I'm leavin' it all up to you you decide what you gonna do
Now do you want my love or are we through
That's why I'm leavin' it up...
 guitar 
I've got my heart in my hand but there's so much that I don't understand
And baby I don't know what I've done wrong
You know I worship the ground you walked on
That's why I'm leavin' it up... <start> I cried for you now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning that's one thing you're learning
I cried for you what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found the heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you now it's your turn to cry over me
Now I found two eyes <start> Love for me hasn't been easy
I've let true love fall to the ground
Through the years and the tears
I've learned what love's about
And this time I'll be ready
When love comes around
When love comes around I'll be ready
Love will find me a brand new man
And I'll be standing here
With my heart in my hand
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around
Too many times I've lost a good love
And I can see now I let it down
But if love comes back to me
It won't see the same old me
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around
When love comes around I'll be ready
Love will find me a brand new man
And I'll be standing here
With my heart in my hand
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around <start> Deep down in Lousiana close to New Orleans
Back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood an old cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B.Goode
Who'd never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell
Go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go go Johnny be Goode
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sit beside the tree by the railroad track
The engineer would see him sittin' in the shade
Listen to the rhythm that the drivers made
The people comin' by they would stop and say
Oh my but that little country boy could play
Go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go go Johnny be Goode
 guitar 
His mama told him someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people come from miles around
To hear you play your music till the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights a sayin' Johnny be Goode tonight
Go go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go go Johnny be Goode <start> OLE SLEW FOOT

' Cave Music
High on the mountain what do you see
Bear tracks bear tracks lookin' back at me
You better get your rifles boys before it's too late
The bear's got a little pig and headed through the gate
He's big around the middle and he's broad across the rump
Doin' ninety miles an hour takin' thirty feet a jump
He never been caught and he ain't never been treed some folks say looks a lot like me
I saved up my money and I bought me some bees
They started makin' honey way up in the trees
I chopped down the tree but my honey's all gone
Ole Slew Foot's done made himself at home
He's big around the middle...
Winter's comin' on and it's twenty below the river's froze over so where can he go
We'll chase him in the gully and we'll run him in the well
And shoot him at the bottom and we'll listen to him yell
He's big around the middle... <start> back when the pictures were silent
back when the music was new
back when remember was just reminding
i played the piano till evening
and when the light grew too dim
i climbed into bed by the picture window
goodbye my love
goodbye my love
goodbye my love
we took the train to the seashore
and buried our toes in the sand
lost to the waves and the salted sunshine
goodbye my love
goodbye my love
goodbye my love
follow the cobblestone walkways
as the bells ring overhead
the garden was green through the picture window
goodbye my love
goodbye my love
goodbye my love <start> No worries
I don't have a single care today
Everything is gonna go my way
No worries
Don't hurry
I can love you girl the whole night long
Play guitar for you and sing my songs
No no no no worries
If life brings rain we'll grow roses
It don't matter what life throws us
I'm alright as long as I've got you you you you
No worries
Let's find a boat and chase the sun
We'll smile and wave at everyone
No no no no worries
So let's get lost out on the ocean
Never look back just keep floatin'
I'm alright as long as I got you you you you
No worries
I don't have a single care today
Everything is goin' to go my way
No no no no worries
Don't hurry
'Cause I can love you girl the whole night long
Play guitar for you and sing my songs
No no no no worries
No worries
No no no no no worries
Na na na na na na no worries
No no no no no worries <start> I like my steak well done my taters fried
Football games on Monday night
It's just who I am
A meat and potato man
I like my coffee black
Ol' TV shows
My women hot and my beer ice cold
It's just who I am
A meat and potato man
I like my fishin' holes lightnin' bugs
Flatt n' Scruggs and my woman's love
It's just who I am
A meat and potato man
I like my Wrangler jeans cowboy boots
Cornbread and beans and country roots
It's just who I am
A meat and potato man <start> CRAZY ARMS

' Tree Publishing BMI  Songs Of Universal BMI
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
For my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time
Now blue ain't the world for the way that I feel
And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now you're not mine
Crazy arms that reach to...
So please take the treasured dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday my crazy arms may hold somebody new but now I'm so lonely all the time
Crazy arms that reach to... <start> I got a sky full of sunshine a pocket full of roses a hand full of I love yous
I ain't got no rooms for no sad song singin' I got a heart full of love for you

Well I used to be sad man in my heart torn apart then I have started
To lovin' you and now it's true I got a heart full of love for you
I got a sky full of sunshine...
 steel  guitar 
Well when your baby starts feelin' blue she feels like the world is fallin' through
Well take her in your arms and whisper low that you love her so
I got a sky full of sunshine...
I got a sky full of sunshine...
Yes a heart full of love for you a heart full of love for you
I got a heart full of love for you <start> The green rolling hills of West Virginia
Are the nearest thing to heaven that I know
Though the times are sad and drear
And I cannot linger here
They'll keep me and never let me go
My daddy said don't ever be a miner
For a miner's grave is all you'll ever own
'Cause the hard times are everywhere
I can't find a dime to spare
These are the worst times I've ever known
So I'll move away into some crowded city
In some northern factory town you'll find me there
Though I'll leave the past behind
I'll never change my mind
These troubled times are more than I could bear
But someday I'll go back to West Virginia
To the green rolling hills I love so well
Yes someday I'll go home
And I know I'll right the wrong
These troubled times will follow me no more <start> I'm tired of watching me hurt you
I'm tired of being the teardrops on your face
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
I know your every weakness
I can find one in everything you say
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm not the one that you really need
I'm not the one in your dreams
I can see it in your eyes
This ain't the way it should feel
I don't know how we got here
Love's no longer blind
If that's just how it is
Can we go on like this
Oh baby what do you say
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
I'll set your heart free
And if you're mine
You'll come flying back some day
But I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
Well I'm taking you with me
Like a room in my heart
You will have your place
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm not the one that you really need
I'm not the one in your dreams
I can see it in your eyes
This ain't the way it should feel
I don't know how we got here
Love's no longer blind
If that's just how it is
Can we go on like this
Oh baby what do you say
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way <start> Twas the dawn of a beautiful beautiful day
When Jesus came into my heart
He came in the darkness and blackness of night
And bade all my sins to depart
The old days are gone and a new day I see
He made all things new when He set my heart free
Twas the dawn of a beautiful beautiful day
When Jesus came into my heart

Some will burn bright. 
Some learn to fly.
Some will run for their lives.
In this town
In this town <start> The leaves have changed from green to golden at least one time and maybe two
All I know is I feel a hundred years older and I still feel the same about you
Time hasn't been the great physician and healed my hurt like it's supposed to do
Lord I feel like a fool by my own admission cause I still feel the same about you
 steel 
I've given everything a man can give it
With a mem'ry there's just three things you can do

It ain't fair for you to leave me cold and cryin' in the night
It ain't fair to take your body from my arms and out of sight
It ain't fair you've gone and left me where you kissed me I still burn
Are you leaving for my loving this awful hurt and then return
It ain't fair for you to leave me alone to face the morning light
It ain't fair you took my body and then to say that it ain't right
It ain't fair you've made me your woman a no longer a good girl in your eyes
How come before you said you'd love me it ain't fair that it ain't right
It just ain't fair that it ain't right <start> If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If being right means being without you
I'd rather live a wrong than right
My mama and daddy say it's a shame
It's a downright disgrace
But as long as I got you by my side
I don't care what my people say
My friends tell me there's no future
In loving a married man
If I can't see you when I want
I'll see you when I can
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
Am I wrong to fall
So deeply in love with you
Knowing you got a wife
And two little children
Depending on you too
Am I wrong to hunger
For the gentleness of your touch
Knowing you got somebody else at home
Who needs you just as much
Am I wrong to give my love
To a married man
Am I wrong for trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
Am I wrong to give my love
To a married man
Am I wrong for trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
I don't wanna be right
If it means sleeping without you
I don't wanna be right
If it means sleeping alone at night
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
No I don't wanna be right <start> A mason jar full of shine
A CD of Leann Rhimes
Is what I bought for our anniversary tonight
Now here I stand with my petunias in hand
And you've got a headache again
I hit a yard sale cut my toenails
Trimmed my nose hairs just right
I thought you'd be impressed
By my new hunting vest
But there's no chance tonight
It ain't the first time this year
It'll be the TV and beer
I about forgot what's its like to be here
As I sleep on the floor
While she sniffles and snores
Did I shave my back for this
Oh man Aww woo
This things duller than a dag burn butter knife
Now I'll bet she'll regret
That she didn't let
Me take her to that motel with a pool
You know its so hard to find
Free HBO and Showtime
And them vibrating beds sure are cool
I souped up my RV
Fired up my Flobee
Trimmed my toupee just right
I tried self tanning cream it turned my skin green
Uh you know the directions uh said that it might
Well its a mystery to me
Why she don't like Cledus T.
Most find me hard to resist
I'm wearing my brand new drawers
And wondering what the heck for
Did I shave my back for this
DeeAnna
Did I shave my back for this
Ohh ohh ohh
 <start> I was born in East Virginia North Carolina I did go
There I met the fairest maiden her name and age I did not know
Her hair it was a light brown color her lips they were red ruby's red
On her breast she wore white lilie there I longed to lay my head
I was born in East Virginia...
I'd rather be in some dark holler where the sun don't never shine
Than to know she loved another and to know she'd never be mine
I was born in East Virginia...
Her name and age I did not know <start> As we were dressing to go out our little girl and boy
Came in and asked if they could go this time
We told them little girls and boys don't belong at parties
And that they should be in bed asleep by nine
The babysitter came in then and we kissed the kids goodbye
And told them that we'd be home soon and told them not to cry
Then we left for the party like we'd so often done
Thinking only of ourselves and not our little ones
The party started out wild and it grew wilder as the night wore on
With drinking laughing telling dirty jokes nobody thinkin' of home
Then the strangest feeling came over me and it chilled me to the bones
And I told my wife that we'd better leave the party
Cause I felt that we were needed at home
As we rode along I got to thinking of how the kids that morning
Had asked if we would take them to church the next day
And how I'd put 'em off like I'd so often done
By saying we'd probably get home too late
Then my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of sirens
As they cut through the still night air
Then we turned down our street that's when we saw the fire
The rest was like a nightmare
We took their little bodies to church the next day
Though we'd left the party early we still got home too late <start> Me and Billy Joe and Mary Beth
Were raised up on the path
Of righteousness
Made a solemn vow that
We'd always be close
And never wander far from
Sawmill Road
As the years went by
The world began to change
One by one we outgrew
Those childhood games
Momma cooked and cleaned
And worried 'bout our souls
We got into beer and cars
And rock 'n' roll
Chorus
We knew Jesus was the answer
And Elvis was the king
Blue Suede Shoes and Rock of Ages
Were the songs we learned to sing
Innocence went out of style
And we just watched it go
Yesterday got left beneath
The dust on Sawmill Road
Billy Joe went to Saigon
For Uncle Sam
Now I go to see him
He don't know who I am
Once a year I get a card
From Mary Beth
She's with husband number four
Somewhere out west
I still live in this old house
Where we were raised
On this red dirt road
The county never paved
Now I watch my kids
And worry 'bout their souls
And pray they'll never wander
Far from Sawmill Road
Chorus
Me and Billy Joe and Mary Beth
Were raised up on the path
Of righteousness. <start> There was a time
There was a place I loved
That was my moment
That's just the way it was
Careless and crazy
Running to God knows where
Now where is that heartland
Where is the one who cares
I can hear you calling
Wandering boy come home soon
I hear the music
I see your face in the moon
Who am I fooling
There's no need for me to pretend
I might sail forever
And never find that island again
I fight with my mem'ry
Find all the pieces I can
Of a beautiful woman
Who trusted her heart in my hands
Now what kind of sailor
Would let such a dream get lost
Tonight we'd be sailing
Out under the southern cross
I can hear you calling
Wandering boy come home soon
I hear the music
I see your face in the moon
Who am I fooling
There's no need for me to pretend
I might sail forever
And never find that island again
Who am I fooling
There's no need for me to pretend
I might sail forever
And never find that island again
I could sail forever
And never find that island again <start> Now I know how Merle Haggard felt when he sang the words Mama Tried
And I lived those teenage Friday nights with a pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
And that summer Becky broke my heart Alabama sang Old Flame Burning
Well I've danced with George Strait drank with George Jones
My life's been a country song
Chorus
It's all about falling down and getting back up
Yeah good times and hard luck
True love and amazing grace
Working all week for a back ache
Raisin' cane on Friday nights
Sunday church to set it right
They can write it on my stone
My life's been a country song
Now I know how Paycheck felt when told his boss to take his job and shove it
And I've had the girl that made me say I like it I love it I want some more of it
And I'll always remember just where I was when the world stopped turning
Through the good and the bad the right and the wrong
My life's been a country song
Chorus
It's been the words when I couldn't find 'em a friend when I've been alone
It's been a toast to the things remembered the strength for moving on
Chorus
Oh my life's been a country song <start> 
When I began this letter I had hopes I wouldn't cry
But I always knew it would cause me more than a stamp to tell you goodbye
Puttin' pain on paper mailing all my hurt to you
Puttin' pain on paper crying in permanent blue
Now this pen lets me say the things I could never say to you
But these shaky lines would look as sad in any shade of blue
Puttin' pain on paper...
I'm glad this ink is permanent it proves I'm not all done
Cause if tears could wash these words away you wouldn't know who they're from
Puttin' pain on paper...
Crying in permanent blue <start> Wish I had a car top rolled down the music up loud
Follow that girl all over town and see
Norma Jean Riley's gonna notice me
Wish I had a dog seen her in the park with a puppy on a string
Looking so cute maybe sooner or later we'd meet
Norma Jean Riley's gonna talk to me
Everybody says fool fool nothin' you can do
Never gonna see her with the likes of you
I say watch and see
Norma Jean Riley's gonna notice me
Oughta learn to dance with the hottest moves and the latest styles
Get her on the dance floor and after awhile you'll see
Norma Jean Riley's gonna dance with me
Everybody says fool fool nothin' you can do
Never gonna see her with the likes of you
I say watch and see
Norma Jean Riley's gonna notice me
Gonna write a song sing about her hair her lips and her eyes
Bring her to tears with my heartfelt honesty
Norma Jean Riley's gonna fall for me
Everybody says fool fool nothin' you can do
Never gonna see her with the likes of you
I say watch and see
Norma Jean Riley's gonna fall for me
Everybody says fool fool nothin' you can do
Never gonna see her with the likes of you
I say watch and see
Norma Jean Riley's gonna marry me <start> Sometimes I go down to old China town
And just walk around just wander around
Where amber lights gleam and blue shadows fall
Just dreaming a dream of my China doll
A silk Chinese coat a little blue pants caral pink lips and tiny pale hands
Oh my China doll my lonely tears fall
I'll never forget you never forget you my China doll
Sometimes I go down and just hang around
And just hang around a boat China bound
And I'd give the word to just leave it all
And sail on that boat to my China doll <start> Boring through the mountains bypassing the towns
Interstate  is a sight to behold
But that monument to progress and engineering skill
Has covered up the old swimmin' hole
Thirty feet straight up from where the old hole stood
They sell twenty kinds of ice cream and the food is good
But it never can compare with the food for the soul
You could get for a dip in the old swimmin' hole
Oh the old swimmin' hole her cool waters ran deep
Felt good to a boy with mud on his feet
And I'm wishing these days I could strip to my soul
And go for a dip in the old swimmin' hole
A symbol of our great and affluent society Interstate  fulfillment of our goals
But that masterpiece of human ingenuity has covered up the old swimmin' hole
Gone the wooden schoolhouse the old country store
The winding dirt road that's winding no more
And the old swimmin' hole hears the sound of speeding wheels
Entombed beneath a blanket of concrete and steel
Oh the old swimmin' hole <start> Written by D. Frazier and A. Owens
The honey bees are gonna be hummin'
Guitar strings are gonna be strummin'
When I'm back in my baby's arms again
Happy wheels are gonna be turnin'
Flames of love are gonna be burnin'
When I'm back in my baby's arms again

No more tears are gonna be fallin'
I done heard my true love callin'
Open arms are waitin' yonder 'round the bend
Rivers of honey are gonna be flowin'
Big sweet flowers are gonna be growin'
When I'm back in my baby's arms again
The voice of love is gonna be talkin'
Hand in hand we're gonna be walkin'
When I'm back in my baby's arms again
Big ol' swings are gonna be swingin'
Water springs are gonna be springin'
When I'm back in my baby's arms again

Oh honey
Back in my baby's arms again <start> well i partied with some crazy calgary cowgirls

dippin snuff at nine and drinkin beer by noon
he'd tell me about the bulls he'd rode in waco
by nitefall he'd be howlin at the moon
howlin good copenhagen is better than bad cocaine
look out for them wranglers out in longview
with the left back pocket worn out of their jeans

so you aint never comin down again
good copenhagen is better than bad cocaine
i knowed about an old alberta oilman
chewed a tin a day till he was ninety two
he passed away a true western original
near the end he liked it sprinkled on his food
he knew that good copenhagen is better than bad cocaine <start> I know that somewhere there's someone
You love more than me
Someone you love more than me
And I hate to say it
But you have a right to be free
I know that's the way it should be
But I'm too far gone
Too far gone
I've loved you so much for so long
And I'm too far gone
If ever your new love
Should hurt you or make you feel blue
Hurt you or make you feel blue
Just remember your old love
Will still be around loving you
I'll be around loving you
'Cause I'm too far gone
Too far gone
I've loved you so much for so long
And I'm too far gone <start> Kawliga was a wooden Indian standing by the door.
He fell in love with an Indian maiden over in the antique store.
Kawliga just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer yes or no.
CHORUS
Poor ol' Kawliga he never got a kiss.
Poor ol' Kawliga he don't know what he missed.
Is it any wonder that his face is red
Kawliga that poor ol' wooden head.
He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk.
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped some day he'd talk.
Kawliga too stubborn to ever show a sign
Because his heart was made of knotty pine.
Kawliga was a lonely Indian never went nowhere.
His heart was set on the Indian maid with the coal black hair.
Kawliga just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer yes or no. <start> Who cares for fame or fortune
Who cares for wealth or gold
Because I find a fortune
Within my arms I hold
A tiny turned up nose
Two cheeks just like a rose
So sweet from head to toes
That little boy of mine
Two arms that hold me tight
Two eyes that shine so bright
Two lips that kiss goodnight
That little boy of mine
No one will ever know
Just what his coming has meant
Because I love him so
He's something heaven has sent
He's all the world to me
He climbs upon my knee
To me he'll always be
That little boy of mine
And when he lays his head
Upon his pillow so white
I pray the Lord above
To guide him safe through the night
In dreams I see his face
And feel his fond embrace
There's no one can replace
That little boy of mine.
HOWEVER
This is the way my dad sang it to me
A tiny turned up nose
Two cheeks just like a rose
So sweet from head to toes
That little boy of mine
Two eyes that shine so bright
Two arms that hold me tight
Two lips that kiss goodnight
That little boy of mine
No one will ever know
Just what his coming has meant
Because I love him so
He's something heaven has sent
He's all the world to me
He climbs upon my knee
To me he'll always be
That little boy of mine
Who cares for fame or fortune
Who cares for wealth or gold
God's given me my fortune
Within my arms I hold
A tiny turned up nose
Two cheeks just like a rose
So sweet from head to toes
That little boy of mine <start> How to find how to know how to keep
I get it
Loves a matter of luck yes indeed
I get it
They say the true romance is just a game of chance
Reacts not better than a ... world
I get it
Everything you say its true
I get it
But they were never loved by you
I get to be the one who gets to kiss you every morning
Guess I got lucky now
Out to everyone that wants your love
I get it
People say you should take what you get
I get it
And so you settle for a little bit less
I get it
So let em ramble on
Weve already prove them wrong
When loves ...happiness was well out of reach
I get it
Everything you say its true
I get it
But they were never loved by you
I get to be the one who gets to kiss you every morning
Guess I got lucky now
Out to everyone that wants your love
I get it
I get your smile every evening
I get your arms every night
And Ill take any kind of reason
To get to get to hold you tight
Youre everything I want everything I need
And everything I ever thought that love was sposed to be
I get it
I get to be the one who gets to kiss you every morning
Guess I got lucky now
Out to everyone that wants your love
I get it I get it I get it
I I I get it I get it oho. <start> Betty drove the semi she pulled up to the pump
I thought I wanted a CocaCola and I started out on the jump
She said hold it Dave come quick there's something you gotta see
That man had got a dancing bear tied up to that old tree
I said dance dance Dakota dance all around the country store
Me and sweet Betty ain't never seen a bear that could dance before
Well it's one step two steps three steps four
A bottle of soda and he'll dance some more
Dance dance Dakota dance all around the country store
Well these hippies walked up to the cage giving pills to that ole bear
I don't know what it was they was giving to him it had him pulling out his hair
I tried to keep time with the music Lord with the beat on my tamborine
Gave him some wine from a Mason jar and we all began to sing
I said dance dance Dakota dance... <start> Well once I met a pretty little girl and she was fair to see
I fell in love with a pretty little girl she fell in love with me
I kissed her on her dimpled chin while stars in heaven did play
But along come a howl in that old north wind and carried her away
North wind north wind bring my baby back again
North wind where did she go nobody but you will ever know
It seems I hear her calling me and when I answer back
I find it's just that old north wind a whistlin' round my shack
Each night before I go to sleep down on my knees I pray
That the old north wind come a howlin' by and carry me away
North wind north wind... <start> Honey if you only knew
What I've the will to do
Endure or take

Begging you to use every last part

Begging you to use every last part

Begging you to use every last part

Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at'all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you
Some people go for cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
Still I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you
Standin' there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously don't adore me aww
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothin' to do
Still I get a kick out of you
Yes I get a kick out of you <start> O CHRISTMAS TREE

But do you tell me do you know that my love is real
The hours pass slowly when you love someone still
And time hurts as well as it heals
The memories of you the heartaches and blues
The dreams that I've planned I know won't come true
You tell me that time will erase how I feel
But time hurts as well as it heals <start> Each time I see an evergreen that makes me think of you
Cause an evergreen is always green and true love's always true

And proclaimed myself the pilot of my soul
But my mind remains uneasy cause the rest of me
Depends on someone I don't even know
May the man who has his finger on the button have a lovely day today
Hope nothing hangs him up or ticks him off or bums him out in any way
Lord help him keep his cool cause he could pull the final curtain on my play
May the man who has his finger on the button have a lovely day today
I can recall when only God could start the world anew
He who left his babies wasted on the shore
But now that man could have the last word if he wanted to
God ain't such a bad dude anymore
May the man who has his finger on the button have a lovely night tonight
Hope he's got himself a honey who knows what to do and I hope she does it right
And in my heart I know you won't go bananas and again he might
May the man who has his finger on the button have a lovely night tonight
May the man who has his finger <start> Just a small town Cinderella

Ain't nothing to the first long night in this empty house alone
The sweetest times of a romance
Will fill your mind the last slow dance
Hold on tight will you make her be the one to say
It's all gone and you know that it's all gone
The lights go down the charge is done
The battle is over and the other side won
It don't help to know that it ain't a matter of trying
I'll hold you close one last time
The cost of love might be my mind
It hurts like hell when you're living in a love that's dying
And you know that's it all over but the crying
I remember everything we've done
And the nights when we were one
The silence comes
I can't imagine my life without you
But you've got plans and I've got mine
It's gonna take a long long time
I hope someday I can smile
And think how crazy I was about you
So crazy about you
The lights go down the charge is done
The battle is over and the other side won
It don't help to know that it ain't a matter of trying
I'll hold you close one last time
The cost of love might be my mind
It hurts like hell when you're living in a love that's dying
And you know that's it all over but the crying
I don't know the reason
And there's nothing to blame but time
And I've looked into your eyes and they don't lie
The lights go down the charge is done
The battle is over and the other side won
It don't help to know that it ain't a matter of trying
I'll hold you close one last time
The cost of love might be my mind
It hurts like hell when you're living in a love that's dying
And you know that's it all over but the crying
It all over but the crying it all over but the crying
It all over but the crying <start> What your leaving's done to me time will never heal
My life just ain't the same all my dreams aren't real
Tearstains on my pillow I'm blue as can be oh that's what your leaving's done to me
I stare at the wall like a fool I guess I am
To be in love with someone who's not around
The moon don't shine the clouds are all I see
Oh that's what your leaving's done to me
They say I'm going crazy well I guess I am
I don't know what to do so I just walk around
The skies that once were blue now they're grey as can be
Oh that's what your leaving's done to me
 steel 
They say I'm going crazy...
Oh that's what your leaving's done to me <start> Delia's gone one more round Delia's gone
First time I shot Delia shot her in the side
The second time I shot her she laid right down and died
Delia's gone one more round Delia's gone
The reason I shot my Delia she cursed such an evil curse
And if I hadn't shot her I'd believe she'd done me worse
Delia's gone one more round Delia's gone Delia's gone one more round Delia's gone
I went down to the graveyard to look at my Delia's face
I said Delia gal I love you and I wish I could take your place
Delia's gone one more round Delia's gone
On Monday I was arrested Tuesday my case was trialed
The jurymen found me guilty brought teardrops in my eyes
Delia's gone one more round Delia's gone Delia's gone one more round Delia's gone
Jailer oh jailer tell me how can I sleep
When all around my bedside I can hear little Delia's feet
Delia's gone one more round Delia's gone
Some gave Delia a dollar some gave her two or three
I didn't give Delia a penny cause she belonged to me
Delia's gone one more round Delia's gone Delia's gone one more round Delia's gone <start> He never knew their names and never really cared
Lying to himself he was never just a young kid scared
Living on his own with no one to hold on to
Nowhere to go and nothing to do
But lie awake and pray that oneday
Someone will come his way
Chorus
All He knows are
Highways and broken hearts late nights and old guitars
Wondering where you are you're so far away
His shoes are worn and tired and not at their best
Like a gypsy never sure where he's going next
Superficial friends and girls with glazed over eyes
It's a good time but just for the night
Then off he'll go to maybe Mexico
Then off through Colorado
All He knows are
Highways and broken hearts late nights and old guitars
Wondering where you are you're so far away
Staring through the walls of that motel room
Reflecting on his days the route he's seemed to choose
Will good outshine the bad can he turn this thing around
Should he drop to his knees just give up now
Begging for release in the night
Has he gone too far to fight
All He knows are
Highways and broken hearts late nights and old guitars
Wondering where you are you're so far away <start> In your haste you left and said you'd be returning
In my sorrow I forgot to ask you when
In my lonely room I sit and count the hours
Every minute hopin' I'll look up and you'll come walkin' in
Chorus
For then and only then will I stop crying
And this aching breaking heart of mind will mend
Not until I feel your arms around me
Will I be happy and I live for then and only then
All that's left inside my heart is just an echo
And the tiny thread of hope to which I cling
But if I keep holding on maybe some day
You'll remember where you left me and come back for me again
Repeat Chorus <start> Just one more dance just one more chance
So I can talk to you
Don't live too fast forget the past
I will try to prove
I would do anything you ask me to
Don't run around don't turn me down
Let me talk to you
Don't go too far with that crowd at the bar
That's not the way to win please fall in love again
Give me your heart so I can start to build our life anew
I know you've paid so if you're afraid let me talk to you
Don't go too far <start> In dreams our love has been redrawn
It shoots up over me then the image is gone
When I tried to follow her all the way home
She stopped and tells me she wants to be alone
She said there's nothing you can hide alright
And if I'm not for you then I will know
When I'm talking to you
If doubt is breaking through your brow
I will know
There's nothing I can do
oooOoOoOooo
I'm not for you
Well there's no sense in staying
You try to force these things they end up breaking
How you gonna live with me on your back
Oh it's getting close it's getting close to that
And there's nothing you can hide alright
And if I'm not for you then I will know
When I'm talking to you
If doubt is breaking through your brow
I will know
There's nothing I can do
oooOoOoOooo
I'm not for you <start> My little boy wrapped the toy in some paper
And he places it underneath our Christmas tree
It was his very favorite toy he got last Christmas
And to think he give it up and just for me
Then little sister came runnin' with her dolly and very shally she climbed upon my knee
She said daddy here's your Christmas present to you with love especially from me
It's not what you give that really matters or how much money you may pay
It's that feeling of giving to others that's what makes Christmas such a pretty day
It's not what you give...
That's what makes Christmas such a pretty day <start> I never knew the power of a song
Till I heard the music playin'
The day that momma passed on.
Never knew what innocence was about
Till the first time I laid eyes on the face
Of a newborn child.
I never knew love
No I mean real love
I never knew that kind of love
Till this moment with you.
I never understood the meaning of home
Till I pulled into that old dirt drive
After being gone too long.
I didn't know what serenity really was
Till I stopped one day to listen to
A river gently run.
I never knew love
No I mean real love
I never knew that kind of love
Till this moment with you.
I've known the hunger before tonight
For other loves.
I felt the yearning
I felt the fire
In their touch.
But this goes deeper
Than anything I've ever known.
Beyond my heart
Clear down to my soul.
I never knew what beauty could behold
Till you looked at me and I could see
Forever unfold.
Oh you made me whole.
I never knew love
No I mean real love
I never knew that kind of love
Till this moment with you.
Till I was loved by you. <start> Touch my heart feel the hurt the pain and misery
Then tell me again what love can do for me
If you lived in my world awhile you'd soon forget how to smile
In my world there's a million ways to cry
If you had my eyes you could see how woman changed my destiny
I'm a man who can't live and yet can't die
See these hands of mine and how they shake all because I can't break
The habit of remembering yesterday
Another love couldn't help this ache I know I'd make the same mistakes
Her mem'ry's always standing in my way
Touch my heart feel the hurt it's destroying me
I've tried but can't seem to shake her memory
Touch my heart feel the hurt the pain and misery
Then tell me again what love can do for me <start> Song sung blue everybody knows one
Song sung blue every garden grows on
Me and you are subject to the blues now and then
But when you take the blues and make a song you sing 'em out again
You sing 'em out again
Song sung blue weeping like a willow
Song sung blue sleeping on my pillow
Funny thing but you can sing it with a cry in your voice
And before you know it starts the feeling good you simply got no choice
 strings 
Me and you are subject to the blues now and then
But when you take the blues and make a song you sing 'em out again
Song sung blue weeping like a willow
Song sung blue sleeping on my pillow
But when you take the blues and make a song you sing 'em out again
Song sung blue <start> Some glad morning when this life is over
I'll fly away to a home in God's celestial shore
CHORUS
I'll fly away Oh glory
I'll  fly away 
When I die Hallelujah by and by
I'll  fly away 
When the shadows of this life have grown
I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison bars have flown
Ill fly away
CHORUS
Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joys shall never end
I'll fly away
CHORUS <start> Here I am a livin' fast smokin' Lucky's and talkin' trash
Hangin' out on a barroom stool actin' like a fool
Out of work and out of luck stay out late and I drink too much
You see my face all over town I ought to settle down
Yes I guess I must confess look at me my life's a mess
Just like a rockin' chair I can't seem to get nowhere
All my friends are married now guess I missed the boat somehow
They all moved away last year but I'm still here
Talkin' big and wastin' time I tell the girls I'm 
But lately I think it shows I'm gettin' old
Yes I guess I must confess
Yes I guess I must confess
Here I am a livin' fast <start> There's a rumour goin' round that it's lookin' like splitsville between us
But all that talk's just talk
So don't you believe it
'Cause I just got a call from my baby
And she was all guess what
We're makin up
Our on again off again is on again
Were makin up
She really wants to make it work
I'm still so in love with her
Forget about everything you've heard
Were makin up
Well I'm the first to admit that the road's been a little bit bumpy
But don't you think for a moment that she don't love me
Take your nosy little nose and get a whiff of these roses on the seat of my truck
Maybe we argue a little too much
Maybe we broke up more than once
Ah but this is the part I love <start> She called me baby baby all night long
Used to hold and kiss me till the dawn
And one day I awoke and she was gone
There's no more baby baby all night long
She called me baby baby all night long
Kissed my tears away when things went wrong
What I'd give if she'd just come back home
And call me baby baby all night long
She called me baby baby all night long
Lift me up so high and made me strong
Now each night in dreams just like a song
I still hear baby baby all night long <start> My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
There's nothing I can think or do or say
To make this crazy dreaming go away
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
I wake up in the morning I go to sleep at night
Somewhere in between the two I swear Ill get it right
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
I'm wondering just how far my mind can stray
Just how wild is too high a price to pay
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
But are they wild enough to make you stay
Or does dreaming only make you stay away
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
My daydreams and my nightmares are so real there's no mistake
It wouldn't so bad if I was not so wide awake
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
There's nothing I can think or do or say
I only hope and pray Ill dream someday
Just one dream wild enough to make you Stay
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day <start> On my fifth birthday I got so upset
About the brand new bike that I didn't get.
I'd prayed my heart out and it didn't seem fair
I told my grandpa I guess God doesn't care
And he just smiled and said my child
Make no mistake every prayer you pray
Gets answered even though
Sometimes the answer is no.
Five years later out behind the shed
With a stolen pack of grandpa's cigarettes
I struck a match and held that first one to my lips
And prayed to God please let me get away with this
And through the smoke I saw grandpa standing there.
Make no mistake every prayer you pray
Gets answered even though
Sometimes the answer is no.
When I think of all the answers in my life I would have to say
There's no doubt it was always for the best
When I didn't get my way.
Grandpa got older like grandpas do
His health was failing and I guess I knew
It'd be best if he was called on hold
But selfishly I prayed that God would keep him hanging on
And when he passed away in my mind I heard him say.
Make no mistake every prayer you pray
Gets answered even though
Sometimes the answer is no.
Sometimes the answer
Is no. <start> Out on the hills of glory land
So happy and free at God's right hand
They tell of a place of marvelous grace
On heaven's bright shore
Pilgrims on earth someday will go
To live in that home forever more
Trusting in Him who died for sin
And rose from the grave
On heaven's bright shore 
There's gonna be no more dyin' 
Not one little grave 
In all that fair land .
Not even a tear will dim the eye
And no one up there will say goodbye
Just singing His praise through endless days
On Heaven's bright shore 
When I must cross that rolling tide
There'll be someone on the other side
Welcoming me to that fair land made perfect by love
When I walk up the milky white way
I'll see that home coming in a ray
How great it must be for angels to see
A pilgrim reach home
On heaven's bright shore 
There's gonna be no more dyin' 
Not one little grave 
In all that fair land 
Not even a tear will dim the eye
And no one up there will say goodbye
Just singing His praise through endless days
On Heaven's bright shore <start> Desperation's causing me
To question every single word you say
The distance that keeps growing in between us
Girl just leaves me so afraid
Well you tried so hard to carry on
But I can tell there's something wrong these days
Well girl I've got to know the truth
Just give it to me straight
Don't' look away
Don't look away
Don't look away
When I ask you if you love me still
And if your gonna stay
Don't look away
Well I've known you long enough to know
You're trying not to let your feelings show
Lately when I hold you near
I still feel I'm sitting hear alone
This confusion setting in your mind
Blocking all the words you mean to say
Well girl I've got to know the truth
Just give it to me straight
Don't look away
Don't look away
Don't look away
When I ask you if you love me still
And if your gonna stay
Don't look away <start> Verse 
Storm blew a tree down in my backyard
My axe wouldn't cut it and my saw wouldn't start
Good excuse for a trip to the hardware store
To give that little hottie workin' a thrill de' jour
I know that she digs me 'cause when I walked in
Here she come a runnin' with a can I help you grin
Like a puppy on a leash she followed me around
I left her droolin' at the mouth when I walked out
Chorus
But I guess you had to be there
To believe what I saw
Her blue eyes glued to my liberty coveralls
She didn't have a prayer
But I guess you had to be there
Verse 
I'm pretty sure she meant to drop that can of W.D.
So I could see her bend over in her tight blue jeans
I was eye to eye with Taz and a Tweety tattoo
Forced to play a little game of peekaboo
Then she led me down the aisle by the pipe and glue
Asked me if I had any plumbing to do
Hands planted firm on the curve of her hip
Looked to me like she was lookin' for a little lip to lip
Chorus
Verse 
She even did that little finger thingy through her hair
Practically undressed me with her Playboy stare
I gave her back that look that she was lookin' for
I think that she forgot that we was in that store
Chorus
Yeah I guess you had to be there
To believe what I saw
Her blue eyes glued to my Liberty coveralls
She didn't have a prayer
But I guess you had to be there <start> I was on the rebound from a broken love affair
When I first thought of glimps of her in you
And though you never measured up to what she meant to me
I couldn't find the words to tell you so
Cause I'm not strong enough to leave you and too weak to let you go
You give me precious love to hold on to
But somehow deep inside I've got a feeling that you know
I'm not strong enough to leave you and too weak to let you go
 steel 
Never once did you hold back the love you had for me
I guess you thought my love for you would grow
But women have a funny way of seeing through a man
But if you knew you never told me so
Cause I'm not strong enough...
No I'm not strong enough to leave you and too weak to let you go <start> Around here it's the hardest time of year
Waking up the days are even gone
The collar of my coat
Lord help me cannot help the cold
The raindrops sting my eyes
I keep them closed.
But I'm feelin' no pain
I'm a little lonely and my quietest friend
Have I the moonlight Have I let you in
Say it ain't so say I'm happy again
Say it's over say I'm dreaming
Say I'm better than you left me
Say you're sorry I can take it
Say you'll wait say you won't
Say you love me say you don't
I can make my own mistakes
Let it bend before it breaks
I'm all right. Don't I seem to be
Aren't I swinging on the stars
Don't I wear them on my sleeve
When you're looking for a crossroads
It happens every day
And whichever way you turn
I'm gonna turn the other way
Say it's over say I'm dreaming
Say I'm better than you left me
Say you're sorry I can take it
Say you'll wait say you won't
Say you love me say you don't
I can make my own mistakes
Learn to let it bend before it breaks
Say it's over say I'm dreaming
Say I'm better than you left me
Say you're sorry I can take it
Say you'll wait say you won't
Say you love me say you don't
I can make my own mistakes
Let it bend before it breaks <start> Well I had the blues
But now theyre gone
Im on a big black freight train
And were movin' on
Im on a big black train and Im movin' on
Im on a big black train and Ill soon be gone
Well this big black train it keeps movin' on
Well if you want me baby better get on the track
Got a oneway ticket and I wont be back
Well this big black freight train
Its movin' down the railroad track
Well you cheated on me baby and you told me lies
You said that you was gonna laugh every time I cried
Well this big black train
Were tellin' you good bye <start> Guess who's back in town
Stompin' around in my old stompin' ground
Too much time away I'm back to stay
But I ain't settlin' down
Tonight we'll burn it down
Let's tear the roof off of this place
Tell everyone you know
They'll see a lot more of my face
Chorus
It's good to be here
Long time no see dear
But I had to give it a go
Took the show on the road
Doin' it everybody's way but my own
Good to be home
Been gone away to long
Stickin' to my guns makin' a good run
Takin' the right track
Hey y'all it's good to be back
Welcome everyone
I've just begun the second half of the show
The nittygritty of the city wasn't pretty
But it taught me some things I didn't know
I swear that I'm not through
To much to do before the end
And the best place to get started
Is right he with all of my friends
Chorus
I'm stonecold on a roll
No one gonna tell me no
Anybody wanna go
Just grab a hold and say yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Chorus
Stickin' to my guns makin' a good run
Takin' the right track
Hey y'all it's good to be back
Oh y'all it's good to be back
Guess who's back in town
Stompin' around <start> I've got a four leaf clover
I hung a horseshoe on the wall
I threw salt over my left shoulder
I'll try anything at all
To get lucky with you
I want you so much
Until you want me too
I ain't gonna give up
I'll throw another nickel in the well
Tell myself this time maybe it'll help
To make my dreams come true
Just in case you're out in your backyard
Lookin' up there too
With a lot of love and a little luck
You'll fall like I fell
I'll just cross my fingers
And throw another nickel in the well
If I could get Houdini
To teach me a trick or two
Then maybe you would see me
In the way I want you to
Gonna knock on wood
It ain't been easy
I've done everything I could
To make you need me
I'll throw another nickel in the well
Tell myself this time maybe it'll help
To make my dreams come true
Just in case you're out in your backyard
Lookin' up there too
With a lot of love and a little luck
You'll fall like I fell
I'll just cross my fingers
And throw another nickel in the well
With a lot of love and a little luck
You'll fall like I fell
I'll just cross my fingers
And throw another nickel in the well
Yeah just cross my fingers
And throw another nickel in the well <start> Way back in ' somewhere in Coffeeville
Was a honky tonk named Big Mable Murphy's
She had a sweetheart named Little Melvin
And hair would fly between them every night
They say Little Melvin got wild on bathtub gin
Cause it made him grow to almost twice his size
He'd try to take over and sass Big Mable
And her great big fist would black Little Melvin's eyes
Big Mable Murphy she loved Little Melvin
But he never did learn to do just what she said
Cause poor Little Melvin woke up every morning
With two black eyes and knuckle bumps on his head
Then late one rainy night Scarface Mouzziola
Came in and started shoving folks around
Big Mable Murphy was back in the kitchen
So just for fun he shot Little Melvin down
Early next morning down by the river
Scarface Mouzziola was found real short of breath
They say that Scarface had died from a whoopin'
He had two black eyes and knuckle bumps on his head
Big Mable Murphy's place raved on until she died
And they say sometimes a tear would fill her eye
And then she'd whisper Lord I'd give anything
If once more I could black Little Melvin's eyes <start> Well hold it right there
You're going nowhere
Until I tell you that you can
It wasn't me that told you
I didn't love you so you
Can just sit down and hold my hand
There's some explaining
I'm anticipating how you're
Gonna let me down easy
Do everything you can to please me
You better hold me awhile
'Till my eyes are dry
I think I have the right
But it may take me awhile
Till I get over you
Do you think it's easy
To just forget my feelings
And smile and turn the other cheek
'Cause you're not stimulated
And I was temporary
Until you found the girl you'd keep
Years ago I told you
If you wanted to go you could
Well I've changed my mind
I didn't know you'd go I'm a little behind
Hold me awhile
'Till my eyes are dry
I think I have the right
But it may take me awhile
Till I get over you
Years ago I told you
If you wanted to go you could
Well I've changed my mind
I didn't know you'd go I'm a little behind
Hold me awhile
'Till my eyes are dry
I think I have the right
But it may take me awhile
Till I get over till I get over you
Till I get over you <start> I am a man of conviction I shattered these walls
Spent my life in a bottle cut myself had to crawl
Stared down a barrel of a  dared the man on the other side
To have the guts to pull the trigger
I am a man of conviction
CHORUS
Convicted of loving one girl too much
Sentenced to live without her touch
Convicted of somehow forgetting God
Sentenced to life of hell on earth
And they aint coming back Ive never known either to lie
It wasnt my intention I am a man of conviction
A promise made a promise broken Ive left nothing uncertain
I took the lower road my back bent to carry my load
I broke hearts along the way made a fool of myself most days
It wasnt my intention but I am a man of conviction
CHORUS x
No dont you cry for me Ive made this bed where I lie
It wasnt my intention I am a man of conviction
Its too late for intervention I am a man of conviction <start> Sadies Song
Pretty boy my faithless fallen angel
Took me completely in his arms
In his eyes I saw Edens garden
But the serpent lay hidden in his charms
Well I used to love to sing with the sunlight in my hair
Til that fateful day when I followed him there
He said climb little Sadie higher
Spread them downy wings and fly
You will find your crown of gilded glory next to mine
Climb little Sadie climb
Icy winds up on Lookout Mountain
Chilled two bodies to the bone
But for that man I did gladly lay down my back
Upon a bed of stone
Well I used to love to sing with the sunlight in my hair
Til that fateful day when I followed him there <start> Somehow in the midst of all the madness that surrounds us
Love's come along out of nowhere like magic and found us
You say you've never been so happy and you cried unashamed
Go on and cry baby cry till you're dry baby I'm used to the rain
For until you came along all that I'd ever known was cloudy skies
I'm used to the rain let it wash all the pain from your eyes and our lives
 guitar 
From now till the end of the world the sun's gonna shine
And the rainbow that follows the rain will be all yours and mine
You say it's because you love me you cried unashamed
Go on and cry baby cry till you're dry baby I'm used to the rain
Go on and cry baby cry till you're dry baby I'm used to the rain <start> Some friends just told me that they saw you and that you asked about me
Howdy why this sudden interest for a long long time now you've been free
You caused our love to be a failure oh why did our lives be such fate
Through those years I loved you dearly but you loved me too little and too late
 steel 
They say you'd hid it that you'd come by and in your rhyme's a spark of gleam
How'd your new friends grow so boring and the wild side of life's not what it seems
Don't you remember what you told me that all your love had turned to hate
I guess it's better we not love again for you loved me too little and too late <start> Here's my keys I want you to take 'em
I think I'm gonna need you to get back home
Hold on to my hat I don't wanna lose it
I couldn't stand for something else to be gone
I'm sure you know the reason I'm here cryin'
I think you'll understand why
Chorus
Tonight I'm the designated drinker
I just lost the one that wrapped me around her finger
I need to get to where I can't think of her
So tonight I'm the designated drinker
I came here to get you to help me
I need a friend to see me through
I hated to call I knew you wouldn't mind at all
I know you know I'd do the same for you
I'm not the kind that likes to drown my sorrow
I may hate myself tomorrow
Oh but
Chorus <start> Anytime the world is gettin' to me all I have to do is think of you
And I know the world cannot undo me I feel so easy loving you
It amazes me at all I seem to be is me loving you and you loving me
It amazes me the rhythm and the rhyme two loving hearts in sweet loving times
Mmm sweet loving times
I never find the words to tell you somehow they're always hard to say
But I hope you feel it when I hold you my love is growing everyday
It amazes me at all... <start> Papa drove a truck nearly all his life
You know it drove mama crazy being a trucker's wife
The part she couldn't handle was the being alone
I guess she needed more to hold than just a telephone
Papa called Mama each and every night
Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were alright
Mama would wait for that call to come in
When Daddy'd hang up then she was gone again
Mama was a looker
Lord how she shined
Papa was a good'n
But the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama
Mama loved men
Mama's in the graveyard
Papa's in the pen
Well it was bound to happen and one night it did
Papa came home and it was just us kids
He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine
If he was lookin' to surprise us he was doin' fine
I heard him cry for mama up and down the hall
Then I heard a bottle break against the bedroom wall
That old diesel engine made an eerie sound
When Papa fired it up and headed into town
Well the picture in the paper showed the scene real well
Papa's rig was buried in the local motel
The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear
He never hit the brakes when he was shifting gears
Mama was a looker
Lord how she shined
Papa was a good'n
But the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama
Mama loved men
Mama's in the graveyard
Papa's in the pen <start> To a boy who grew up walking in the woods and the fields of South Carolina
This big ole city feels hard underneath my feet
And to a kid who ain't never heard a noise a whole lot louder than a freight train
I get scared sometimes just standing here along the street
Concrete concrete everywhere I turn there's concrete
Found in the pavement day after day I wanna go home
Where the sun shines and the tall pines and the earth and the heavens meet
I'd rather starve on a poor dirt farm than to stay here surrounded by the concrete
Cause it's turnin' me into concrete
My kids ain't never gone wadin' in a creek or cuttin' down cane for fishing
They've never seen a blackberry growin' wild
Sometimes I get to missin' it so I almost take to crying
I'm cursed with the body of a man and the heart of a child
Concrete concrete <start> Pirogue Joe  Charley Pride
Down in Louisiana where the bayou blows
Lives a little man called Pirogue Joe
He wears a red shirt and a pole cat cap
And when he walks his gum boots flip flop flap
He's got a puppet on a string and a trick yoyo
And a pup in his pocket called Tee Me Moe
He puts on a show everywhere he goes
That's why they love little Pirogue Joe
musical interlude
He's fast as a lightening quick as a cat
He can out run the best musk rat
He can make a pirogue go go go
That's why they call him Pirogue Joe
He's a happy go lucky son of a gun
He always has a lot of fun
He laughs and jokes everywhere he goes
That's why they love little Pirogue Joe
musical interlude
He's got a spot where he likes to go
The girls all dance with Pirogue Joe
He swings them high to a doe si doe
Down where they do the fain doe doe
Eats po'boy shrimp drinks strawberry wine
Dance all night have a good time
They all keep time to the fiddler's bow
That's why they love little Pirogue Joe
muslcal interlude to fade <start> I get all choked up
When you tell me you love me
Then whisper my name
I get lost in your touch
And I find myself getting carried away
To a far away place
Where I lose track of time
And cherish each minute endlessly
Yea that's what I do when do what you do to me
Chorus
Oh my heart goes crazy
Over you baby
When you do what you do
No if's and's or maybe's
I'll always be in love with you
I get sentimental
And get tears in my eyes
It happens so easily
Yea that's what I do when do what you do to me
Chorus
I still get a thrill
Just like the first time
But that ain't hard to believe
Yeah that's what I do when you do what you do to me
Yeah that's what I do when you do what you do to me <start> Hey little girl you might not know this song
This is not the kind of song that you can sing along to
Hey little girl
Maybe some day
Least that's what all the good people will say
Hey little girl look what you've done
You've gone and stole my heart and made it your own
You've stole my heart and made it your own
Hey little girl black and white and right and wrong
Only live inside a song I will sing to you
You don't ever have to feel lonely
You will never lose any tears
You don't have to feel any sadness
When you look back on the years
How can I look you in the eyes
And tell you such big lies
The best I can do is try to show you
How to love with no fear
My little girl
You've gone and stole my heart and made it your own
You've stole my heart and made it your own <start> We are the lucky ones we know the truth
Our daughters and sons just like us in our youth
Generations before us watch over from above
They filled us with faith and they showered us with love
My girl's just like her mama loves with all her heart
And my son keeps me smilin' when life seems too hard
We're lucky that we have their love
'Cause some can only dream
So I never take for granted what I know means everything
We are the lucky ones
We are the lucky ones
We are the lucky ones we know the score
There's you and there's me and those fools at our door
They want what we have but they don't understand
It's a secret that keeps us still holdin' hands
We are the lucky ones
We are the lucky ones
Time keeps on tickin' while we watch the clock
We learn from mistakes yeah we've been around the block
The way that this cruel world turns some upside down
It's amazing to me that we're still hangin' 'round
Strange as it seems
I live my life like some sweet dream
One day I'm flying through the air
Next I'm danglin' by a string
Tell me am I walkin' on coals or treadin' on thin ice
To have a little heaven here on earth
Well hell I'll pay the price
We are the lucky ones
We are the lucky ones <start> Mexicali rose stop crying
I'll come back to you some sunny day
Every night you know that I'll be pineing
Every hour of year while you're away
Dry those big brown eyes and smile dear
Banish all those tears and please don't cry
Kiss me once again and hold me
Mexico rose goodbye
Mexicali rose I'm leaving don't feel blue
Mexicali rose stop grieving I love you
When the dove of love is winging through the blue
All the castles you've been building will come true
Mexicali rose stop crying
I'll come back to you some sunny day
Every night you know that I'll be pineing
Every hour of year while you're away <start> Ahahahaaaaah
Ahahahaaaaah
My own true love
My own true love
At last I've found you
My own true love
No lips but yours
No arms but yours
Will ever lead me
Through Heaven's door
I roamed the Earth
In search of this
I knew I'd know you
Know you by your kiss
And by your kiss
You've shown true love
I'm yours forever
My own true love
My own true love <start> They come off soundin' pretty pompous
Each time they open their mouth
You can't believe it when you hear it
What they let come rollin' out
Don't know why they're so superhateful
Ain't like they've got it so bad
If they'd do more singin' and less talkin'
I think we'd all be glad
Say goodbye to Natalie
Adios Martie and Emily
They think that they're too cool
The chicks no longer rule
All country fans agree
Now they're threatenin' to quit
Like we really give a yeah
They say they're goin' pop
Garth he tried and flopped
But we won't soon forget
Martie Emily and Natalie
Was it the lack of nominations
At this year's C.M.A.'s

That got them tradin' in their banjos
For a drum machine and DJ's
Next thing you know they'll be on Soul Train
Out on the road with Eminem
They'll put some blingbling in their videos
And we'll all make fun of them
Say goodbye to Natalie
Adios Martie and Emily
The only folks in line
Are holding picket signs
And burning Chicks CDs
Wasn't it a sight to see
Them posin' naked on a magazine
Now everybody knows
They're overexposed
If you know what I mean
Martie Emily and Natalie
So go load up your tour bus and pull on out
'Cause your careers may soon be done
You bunch of multiplatinum jackass millionaires
Yeah yeah rock 'n' roll here they come
Say goodbye to Natalie
Adios Martie and Emily
We hate to see it in
Why can't we be friends
Please don't be mad at me
Martie Emily and Natalie
See ya later Natalie
You are the weakest link goodbye <start> Do you think the raindrops will ever stop falling
Do you think the stars will grow dim
Do you think my teardrops will ever stop flowing
Till I want your love back again
I was a fool when I played with your heart
And brought you the shame that has torn us apart
Do you think I'll ever get over the sorrow
For being the fool that I've been
I was a fool when I played with your heart
And brought you the shame that has torn us apart
Do you think I'll ever get over the sorrow
For being the fool that I've been <start> 
My father is an engineer my brother drives a hack
My sister takes in washin' and the baby bolls a jack
And it looks like I'm never gonna cease my wanderin'

I've done a lotta wanderin' early and late
From New York City to the Golden Gate
And it looks like I'm never gonna cease my wanderin'

Been a working on a railroad been a working on a farm
But all I got to show for it is a muscle on my arm
And it looks like I'm never gonna cease my wanderin'
 <start> She told me that her name was Jenny
She lived in a cabin on the hill
In a coal mining town in West Virginia
I love jenny and I guess I always will
I thought I would always want to ramble
I thought I would never settle down
Well I meet her in the hills of West Virginia
In the heart of a coal mining town
I like the sound of the coal trucks
Back in the hills a hauling coal
With the beautiful mountains all around me
West Virginia you have won my heart and soul
I thought I would always want to ramble
I thought I would never settle down
Well I meet her in the hills of West Virginia
In the heart of a coal mining town
I thought I would always want to ramble
I thought I would never settle down
Well I meet her in the hills of West Virginia
In the heart of a coal mining town
In the heart of a coal mining town <start> Well I come from the rural Midwest
It's the land I love more than all the rest
It's the place I know and understand
Like a falsefront building
Like the back of my hand
And the men I knew when I was coming up
Were sober as coffee in a Styrofoam cup
There were Earls and Rays Harlans and Roys
They were fullgrown men
They were barbed wire boys
They raised grain and cattle on the treeless fields
Sat at the head of the table and prayed before meals
Prayed an Our Father and that was enough
Pray more than that and you couldn't stay tough
Tough as the busted thumbnails on the weathered hands
They worked the gold plate off their wedding bands
And they never complained no they never made noise
And they never left home
These barbed wire boys
'Cos their wildest dreams were all fenced in
By the weight of family by the feeling of sin
That'll prick your skin at the slightest touch
If you reach too far if you feel too much
So their deepest hopes never were expressed
Just beat like bird's wings in the cage of their chest
All the restless longings all the secret joys
That never were set free
In the barbed wire boys
And now one by one they're departing this earth
And it's clear to me now 'xactly what they're worth
Oh they were just like Atlas holding up the sky
You never heard him speak you never saw him cry
But where do the tears go that you never shed
Where do the words go that you never said
Well there's a blink of the eye there's a catch in the voice
That is the unsung song
Of the barbed wire boys <start> Bellamy Brothers  Our Family

They let Bubba out of prison
He paid for his crime
He didn't know them bad cheques
Could give him so much time
Sister's getting married
There's a shotgun on the groom
Hope they finish the wedding vows
Before the baby's due

Harry's in the closet
He's been there all his life
Everybody wonders
Why he never took a wife
We owe a lot of bills
Trying to live beyond our means
Ain't got a pot
But we got cable TV
CHORUS

But it's our family
Full of skeletons and ghosts
And even with our strange relatives
It's the one we love the most
There may be a bunch of nuts
Up our family tree
Yeah we may all be crazy
But it's still our family

Grandpa's got a girlfriend
A woman half his age
Grandma laughs about it
But I sense the silent rage
And Uncle Burt still thinks
He's on the grand old armoury
That fever from the war
Left him living in a dream

We buried Great AnnMartha
Out the forest lawns today
Now I think I know why
They Called Great AnnMartha great
The church was full of strange men
Mama called it a disgrace
She said they should have wiped that
Smile off Great AnnMarthas face
Chorus

But it's our family
Full of skeletons and ghosts
And even with our strange relatives
It's the one we love the most
There may be a bunch of nuts
Up our family tree
Yeah we may all be crazy
But its still our family <start> There's a family Bible on the table its pages torn and hard to read
But the family Bible on the table will ever be my key to memory
At the end of day when work was over and when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us from the family Bible
And we'd count our many blessings one by one
I can see us sitting round the table when from the family Bible dad would read
And I can hear my mother softly singing rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me
This old world of ours is full of trouble but this old world would also better be
If we'd find more Bibles on the tables and mothers singing rock of ages cleft for me
I can see us sitting <start> This Levi's that I'm wearing have been good to me
They just won't admit they're growing old
Though my shirt's made contract with a gutter now and then
At least it keeps my body from the cold
Thank God the folks back home in Harlan County
Can't see what success has done for me
Would you believe that kids in Harlan High School voted me most likely to succeed
Now I'm walking on the sidewalks of Chicago
If I buy the bread I can't afford the wine
Now I'm walking on the sidewalks of Chicago wishing I had lived some other time
I wasn't here too long before I met her the lady really swept me off my feet
She stayed just long enough for me to love her
And now they're sweeping me up off the street
My mama thinks I've really hit the big time
She's written every day since I've been gone
She don't know hat  East Charlotte is the address of the West Side Mission Home
Now I'm walking on the sidewalks <start> You light up every street light
You stop every heart when you start that smile
But somehow you're still lonely
Oh let me show you why you're the only one I wanna give my heart to
If you give me the chance oh I'll show you it's alright
Oh watch your life
To pick you up I'd lay you down
I'd hold you 'til you come unwound
I'd make you feel like you're all I need
In this whole world
Ah if you were my girl
If you were my girl
You wouldn't be staring at the ceiling
With a half broke heart wondering if that feeling is ever
Going to fade away
I'd change all that if you let me today
'Cause I've never wanted anything
The way I want you next to me
For all my life
Come on let's ride
I'll pick you up I'll lay you down
I'd hold you 'til you come unwound
I'd make you feel like you're all I need
In this whole world
Ah if you were my girl
If you were my girl
For the first time maybe ever who am I kidding
Girl I've never felt the way I feel oh it's so real
Let me pick you up and lay you down
Hold you 'til you come unwound
I'll make you feel like you're all I need
In this whole world
If you were my girl
If you were my girl
If you were if you were my girl
If you were my girl
Oh if you were if you were my girl
If you were if you were my girl <start> Steam on the window where you draw those little hearts
On those nights we'd take the long way home and find a place to park
Remember makin' love on a spring break beach
In Panama City had a hell of a week
Young and wild and nothin' could tear us apart
Yeah I'll never forget the way I felt
The first time you said those three words to me
It's kind of hard to believe
That you ain't nothin' but a memory
A used to be
My best friend that I loved like crazy
The only one
I thought I'd ever need
You're just a one time way back when
Back when it was you and me
But now
You ain't nothin' but a memory
Well theres a handful of pictures in a dusty shoebox
Sittin' in your closet right behind that dress you wore to senior prom
So if you're lonley tonight and missin' those times
Take a look inside if you're lookin for me
'Cause that's where I'll be
'Cause you ain't nothin' but a memory
A used to be
My best friend that I loved like crazy
The only one
I thought I'd ever need
You're just a one time way back when
Back when it was you and me
But now
You ain't nothin' but a memory
It's another missed call
a midnight text
Another temptation
makeup sex
No
It's time to let it all go
'Cause you ain't nothin' but a memory
A used to be
My best friend that I loved like crazy
The only one
I thought I'd ever need
You ain't nothin' but a memory
A used to be
My best friend that I loved like crazy
The only one
I thought I'd ever need
You're just a one time way back when
You're just a one time way back when
Back when it was you and me
But now
You ain't nothin' but a memory
Now you ain't nothin' but a memory <start> What's that
I hear angels singing.
Telling me to make my move.
Listen to it their voices ringing baby.
If you feel it get in the groove.
Love is a rhythm of two hearts beating
pounding out a message steady and true.
Talk to me baby tell me what you're feeling.
I know what love is what's it to you
Time's up train's aleavin' baby
Are you ready to take that ride
Get on board don't keep me waiting
Say you're willing to cross that line.
Love is a rhythm of two hearts beating
pounding out a message steady and true.
Talk to me baby tell me what you're feeling.
I know what love is what's it to you <start> If I drove a truck
And I were a waitress
And I ordered coffee
And I poured you some
Then you stop by one on your way
Some time later
And if we armwrestled
I'd say that to won
I hear my baby ride again
Ride high in the saddle all day
If you're lovin' is good
And your cookin' ain't greasy
We'll jump the chuck wagon
And we'll ride away
If I were a winsome
And pale signorita
And I was a bullfighter
If I ran the country
I'd be your first lady
And fix up the White House
While you were away
Waiting while I'm passing time
With world leaders
And later together
Alone we might lay <start> Doyle Lawson  Quicksilver
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeell.
You gotta dig a little deeper
if that girl's a keeper
Lose a little bit of your pride
You gotta dig a little deeper
if you wanna keep her
Keep her satisfied.
You spend your life
a runnin' around
Out there on the road
Leavin' your woman a settin' at home
To shoulder all a the load.
You gotta dig a little deeper
if that girl's a keeper
Lose a little bit of your pride
You gotta dig a little deeper
if you wanna keep her
Keep her satisfied.

Well now love is just a game
That everbody plays
You're either gonna win or lose
A winner walks away
high as a kite
With the loser left
cryin' the blues.
You gotta dig a little deeper
if that girl's a keeper
Lose a little bit of your pride
You gotta dig a little deeper
if you wanna keep her
Keep her satisfied.

Weeeeeeeeeeell.
If you gotta good woman
Who's a waitin' at home
with dinner on the table at five
You gotta tell her
you appreciate her every day
And you love her
till the day that you die.
You gotta dig a little deeper
if that girl's a keeper
Lose a little bit of your pride
You gotta dig a little deeper
if you wanna keep her
Keep her satisfied.
Dig a little deeper
Dig a little deeper
Dig a little deeper
Dig a little deeper
Dig a little deeper
Dig
You've got to
Dig a little deeper
If you wanna keep her
Keep her satisfied.
Keep her satisfiiiiiiiiied. <start> I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love with a girl
That's what's the matter with me
I'm in love
I'm in love with a beautiful girl
But she don't give a darn about me
to make her love me I tried
How I sighed and I cried
But she just refused
And ever since she's gone away
I've got those lovesick blues
Got the feeling called the blue hoo's
since my sweetie said Good Bye
Seems I don't know what to Do Hoo
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone
I'm yearning for it yet
She thrilled me filled me
with a kind of lovin'
I never will forget the way she called me sweet daddy
Twas just a beautiful dream
I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart it seems
I got so used to her somehow
But I'm no body's baby
Now gee it's awful when you're lonesome
and get those lovesick blueoooooooo's
Got the feeling called the blue hoo's
since my sweetie said Good Bye
Seems I don't know what to Do Hoo
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone
I'm yearning for it yet
She thrilled me filled me
with a kind of lovin'
I never will forget the way she called me sweet daddy
Twas just a beautiful dream <start> Salina I'm as nowhere as I can be
Could you add some somewhere to
Ahh Kansas I'm kneeling ah Kansas please
Cleveland I ain't never felt nothing so strong
Been believin' the words to my song
Ohio I'm leaving Ohio I'm Gone
From town to town and state to state
There's people everywhere that try to capture us
We stole the cash and left our names
And almost slipped in Indianapolis
The rain it fell the story went on
The rain it fell and we got gone
Poughkeepsie hang up the telephone
I won't answer your phone calls no more
New York quit calling New York let me be
I'm changing the plans I've been setting on
I'm scared by the way that my life's getting gone
Carolina one day I'll someday I'll come home
Home home <start> I don't have too much to say
'Bout most things anyway
The weather's cold or it's hot
It's either wet or it's not
I'm no expert on life
I just try to do right
I'm a man of few words
But since you asked about her
Chorus
I love her and I need her
I'll do anything to please her
'Cause I like to see her smile
And watch her eyes light up
Just like the morning sun
The day I met her
Knew I never would forget her
So I bought a ring and put it on her finger
And I promised her my heart
Forever more and I won't ever take it back
And that's all I've got to say about that
Well I'm just quiet I guess
I ain't got much on my chest
I try to keep a good name
I stay dry when it rains
Fish bite or they don't
But if you're talking they won't
So I'm saving my breath
For something worth being said
Chorus
I love her and I need her
I'll do anything to please her
'Cause I like to see her smile
And watch her eyes light up
Just like the morning sun
The day I met her
Knew I never would forget her
So I bought a ring and put it on her finger
And I promised her my heart
Forever more and I won't ever take it back
And that's all I've got to say about that <start> I hear your love has gone away
Left you feeling blue
Don't you know that one fine day
Love will come to you
When the tears are over
All the stories have been told
Step into the sun
You might find the one
God loves a river
Even if that river never hits the sea
Fairy tales to rummage sales
We all love a dream
Life is so damn messy
Love is so unclean
You cannot hold a hand
That is a thousand miles away
Best to let it go
For reasons we may never know
God loves a river
Even if that river never
I say that God loves a river
Even if that river never hits the sea
God must love a river
Even if that river never
I say that God loves a river
Even if that river never hits the sea <start> I was foolish  once
And I let my once get away
I was happy  once
You'd never believe it today
I got careless  once
All at once you got away
Life had beauty  once
It's not worth livin' today
I slipped out  once
All at once you slipped away
Oh great regret like the flavor of wine
Only grows deeper with the passing of time
Life had meaning  once
It's cold and so empty today
I was foolish  once
I let my once get away <start> Tonight in a bar alone I'm sitting
Apart from the laughter and the cheers
While scenes from the past rise before me
Just watchin' the bubbles in my beer
A vision of someone who loved me
Brings a lone silent tear to my eye
Oh I know that my life's been a failure
Just watchin' the bubbles in my beer
I'm seeing the road that I've traveled
A road paved with heartaches and tears
And I'm seeing the past that I've wasted
While watchin' the bubbles in my beer
As I think of the heart that I've broken
And all the golden chances that have passed me by
And the dreams that I've made now are empty
As empty as the bubbles in my beer <start> Are you happy baby
After what you put me through
Hope you're happy baby
Cause I don't believe you're gonna find anyone
Who loves you better than I do
Sometimes I wonder if you ever knew
How much you were hurtin' me
You fell in love with someone else
And just like that you deserted me
Haven't seen you for so long
Thought I'd call
I wonder are you happy baby
Do you miss me a all
Oo oo before you go now
I just gotta know now
Are you happy baby
Is she there to stand by you
Was it worth it baby
Well I don't believe you're gonna find anyone
Who loves you better than I do
Some friends of yours and mine say lately
Things with you ain't been so good
I told you I would never take you back again
But you know I would
Doesn't matter anymore who was wrong
I wonder are you happy baby
Don't you wanna come home. <start> Our bodies lay here side by side
But our thoughts have turned the other way
We make the conversation of two people
Who have nothing left to say
We're so accustomed to each other
We no longer care or bother
And there lies the danger
You know the size of clothes I wear
You know how I comb my hair
But you could know as much about a stranger
I can't remember the last time
That I really wanted you
And we both say nothings wrong
But it's here in everything we do
So we get up from our beds
Leaving many thing unsaid
And there lies the danger
Many of my words you don't hear
You seldom notice if I'm near
You could know as much about a stranger
What went wrong I can't name it
Find the fault I can't blame it
On any one thing
We're so used to things this way
Tomorrow's just like yesterday
And there lies the danger
You know the colour of my eyes
You know the things I despise
But you could know as much about a stranger
Yes you could know as much about a stranger <start> When I think about the time that I sat crying in my beer
Jukebox pounding misery from ear to ear
I know I'd tell myself I'm better off without you here
But I'm looking for beginnings when the end is always near
She's leavin' in the morning sing a sad song for me
Keeping me in the dark don't know how long it will be
But I've heard that tune before she says she's gotta be free
But I know that's not true and that's what's bothering me
Anywhere you look it's everywhere and all around
It's the blues they keep singing lord and it's bound to get you down
But the melody can move you in a way to ease the pain
And it won't be long before you're on your feet again
I'd be alright if she'd just make up her mind
I don't know why but I forgive her time after time <start> Were we just kids just starting out
Didn't we know then love was about
Were we just fooling playing around
Were we ever gonna get out of this town
Move to Seattle stay up all night
That was when bedtime was our biggest fight
All in a moment all in a sound
All in a day's work we're tumbling down
Down by the old school trash in the street
Searching the eyes of the strangers we meet
Asking will it get better
Will we be alone
Turning the wheels of our bicycles home
Over the rainbow out in the snow
Learning to walk with the sand in our toes
Long to be tall kissed when you fall
Hopping that someone will come when you call <start> Let it rain let it pour let it rain a whole lot more
'Cause I got them deep river blues
Let the rain drive right on let the waves sweep along
'Cause I got them deep river blues
My old gal's a good old pal and she looks like a water fowl
When I get them deep river blues
Ain't no one to cry for me and the fish all go out on a spree
When I get them deep river blues
Give me back my old boat I'm gonna sail if she'll float
'Cause I got them deep river blues
I'm goin' back to Muscle Shoals times are better there I'm told
'Cause I got them deep river blues
Let it rain let it pour let it rain a whole lot more
'Cause I got them deep river blues
Let the rain drive right on let the waves sweep along
'Cause I got them deep river blues
If my boat sinks with me I'll go down don't you see
'Cause I got them deep river blues
Now I'm gonna say goodbye and if I sink just let me die
'Cause I got them deep river blues
Let it rain let it pour let it rain a whole lot more
'Cause I got them deep river blues
Let the rain drive right on let the waves sweep along
'Cause I got them deep river blues <start> I've been lonesome
I've been empty
I got an achin'
Way down inside
I need someone
Someone to hold me
Pull down the shade
Turn out the light
And love me tonight.
Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door.
I need you so now
Come on let's go now
Kick off your shoes
Turn out the light
And love me tonight.
Now don't you worry
We're all alone now
Let your hair down
Sit by my side
Turn off the T.V.
Put on some music
Pull down the shade
Turn out the light
And love me tonight
Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door.
I need you so now
Come on let go now
Kick off your shoes
Turn out the light
And love me tonight <start> HE WAS THERE ALL THE TIME
Writer Gary Paxton
 Time after  time I went  searching for  peace in some  void.  I was  trying to blame All my  ills on this world I was  in.   Surface relationships  used me 'til  I was done  in.  And  all of the while someone was  begging To free me from  sin.  Chorus He was  there  all the  time  He was  there all the  time  Waiting  patiently in  line  He was  there  all the  time.   Never again Will I look for a fake rainbow's end. Now that I have the answer My life is just starting to rhyme. Sharing each new day with Him Is a cup of fresh wine. And oh what I missed He's been waiting right there all the time. Chorus <start> Baby sweet sweet baby my world's so cold and empty since you've gone
Baby sweet sweet baby without you I don't know how I'll go on
I've got that lonesome feeling deep inside of me
And it just keeps right on hurtin' all the time
Oh I'd forget you if it wasn't for your memory
You're out of sight but you're never never out of my mind
Oh baby sweet sweet baby I can't help loving you the way I do
Baby sweet sweet baby please come on back and call me baby too baby <start> There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying the stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh ooh and she's buying the stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
Oh it makes me wonder
Oh it makes me wonder
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking
Oh it makes me wonder
Oh it makes me wonder
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes there are two paths you can go by but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder
Your head is humming and it won't go in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady can you hear the wind blow and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And she's buying the stairway to heaven <start> 
Though the sun may be dawning
You're the one that lights the morning
As I awake to the heaven
Of your sweet summer lovin'
By a stream in the country
Running barefoot and feeling free
While the love in our hearts blend
Into sweet summer lovin'
Sweet summer lovin' in the dandelions
Sweet summer lovin' keeps me high as candy wine
When that big red balloon sets
Like a painting across the West
As the sky turns a crimson blue
As the world turns for me and you
By the light of the moon glowing
While the warm summer wind blows
'Cross the sill of your window
We'll be letting our love flow
Sweet summer lovin' in the dandelions
Sweet summer lovin' keeps me high as candy wine
Sweet summer lovin' in the dandelions
Sweet summer lovin' keeps me high as candy wine
Sweet summer lovin'
Sweet summer lovin'
Mmm...
Sweet summer lovin'
Mmm...
Sweet summer lovin'
I love your sweet summer lovin'
Sweet summer lovin'
Sweet summer lovin'
Mmm...
Sweet summer lovin'
Mmm...
Sweet summer lovin' <start> Life ain't always beautiful
Sometimes it's just plain hard
Life can knock you down
It can break your heart.
Life ain't always beautiful
You think you're on your way
And it's just a dead end road
At the end of the day.
But the struggles make you stronger
And the changes make you wise
And happiness has it's own way
Of taking it's own sweet time.
No life ain't always beautiful
Tears will fall sometimes
Life ain't always beautiful
But it's a beautiful ride.
Life ain't always beautiful
Some days I miss your smile
I get tired of walking
All these lonely miles.
And wish for just one minute
That I could see your pretty face
Guess I can dream
But life don't work that way.
But the struggles make me stronger
And the changes make me wise
And happiness has it's own way
Of taking it's sweet time.
No life ain't always beautiful
But I know I'll be fine
Life ain't always beautiful
But it's a beautiful ride.
What a beautiful ride <start> Sleep darling rest your mind
I'll drive all night to get to you
Please moan softly if you must moan at all
I'm moving through the night toward you
Sleep darling sleep darling
I'm on my way to you
I'm on my way to you
Rest my angel not one word
Between you and I on the telephone line
You are weary and need your sleep
So leave the hard thinking and the driving to me
Sleep darling sleep darling
I'm on my way to you
I'm on my way to you
Let go <start> What colour is the wind Daddy
Is it yellow red or blue
When he's playing with my hair Daddy
Does he do the same to you
When he's dying does his colour fade
Is a gentle breeze a lighter shade
Just like his friend the sea
The wind feels blue to me

When the blackbird starts to sing Daddy
Do the flowers hear him too
When he's pouring out his heart Daddy
Tell me what do roses do
Do they cast their scent upon the air
And is fragrance just a rose in prayer
Giving thanks to God above
For the blackbird's song of love

CHORUS
Blow wind blow
Wild and free
My Daddy says
You're a lot like me
I know each colour
Its shape and size
I've seen them all
With my Daddy's eyes

I know that grass is green Daddy
I've touched it with my toes
And snow is purest white Daddy
I've felt it with my nose
But my favorite colour has to be
The colour of your love for me
And Daddy I've been told
That love is always gold

REPEAT CHORUS
My Daddy says
You're a lot like me
What colour is the wind <start> Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow Let It Snow Let It Snow
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow Let It Snow Let It Snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let It Snow Let It Snow Let It Snow <start> LEAVE MY BABY ALONE

RECORDED BY WANDA JACKSON
Don't you be a tellin' my baby lies
You better leave my baby alone
And don't you be a winkin' your flirty eyes
You better leave my baby alone
Well I'm not mean and I'm not bad
You better leave my baby alone
You know a jealous gal keep gettin' mean and mad
You better leave my baby alone
He's the only one for me I've always been his girl
And he's all I've got so can't you see I just can't let you take my world
You better gather your sweet talk somewhere else
You better leave my baby alone
Now I can handle my baby all by myself
You better leave my baby alone
You better leave my baby alone
You better leave my baby alone
He's the only one for me I've always been his girl
And he's all I've got so can't you see I just can't let you take my world
You better gather your sweet talk...
You better leave my baby alone you better leave my baby alone
You better leave my baby alone you better leave my baby alone <start> I must've been fooled when you touched my heart
Skies were red and blazing
I heard a moan in the elms above
And I knew the day was ending
I knew you'd seen your happiest day
When the next morn the birds were singing
We felt the same cold from the earth
It took the moon to hold the tide
And set our hearts a spinning
You'd wait for dark never come again
I'll turn my back to the calling sun
If you'll rise and meet me
I'll walk the road I took from you
Oh stay a while and the red sky is blazing
Touch my heart and feel my burning
For the day you left
For the arms above
To me those birds are singing <start> Please release me let me go
For I don't love you anymore
To waste our lives would be a sin
Release me and let me love again
I have found a new love dear
And I will always want her near
Her lips are warm while yours are cold
Release me my darling let me go
Oh please release me let me go
For I don't love you anymore
To waste our lives would be a sin
So release me and let me love again
Please release me can't you see
You'd be a fool to cling to me
To live a lie would bring us pain
So release me and let me love again <start> Take hold of my hand
And I'll do what I can
To make everything right
At least for tonight
If you'll just take hold of my hand
Press your lips against mine
And I promise to find
A way out of the pain
Some place safe from the rain
If you'll just press your lips against mine
I've lusted for love but lust is so blind
And trust for a heart is a hard thing to find
But what's left of yours might help to heal mine
Come and lay here by me
And I swear you will see
That the hurt from before
Don't live here no more
If you'll just come and lay here by me
I've lusted for love but lust is so blind
And trust for a heart is a hard thing to find
But what's left of yours might help to heal mine
Take hold of my hand
And I'll do what I can
To make everything right
At least for tonight
If you'll just take hold of my hand
If you'll just take hold of my hand
Sha la la la la la
Sha la la la la la
Sha la la la la la
Sha la la la la la
If you'll just take hold of my hand
Sha la la la la la
Sha la la la la la
Sha la la la la la
Sha la la la la la
If you'll just take hold of my hand <start> If I pour your cup that is friendship
If I add your milk that is manners
If I stop there claiming ignorance of taste
That is tea
But if I measure the sugar
To satisfy your expectant tongue
Then that is love
But if I measure the sugar
To satisfy your expectant tongue
Then that is love
Sitting untouched and growing cold <start> I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You think you know the smile on her lips
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You think you'll find heaven of bliss
In each caress in each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You stole her love from me one day
You didn't care oh it hurt me
But you can never steal away memories of what used to be.
You think she's yours to have and to hold
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her. <start> When I was young back on the farm I could hardly wait
Till Sunday came and my true love would meet me by the gate
And we'd go roamin' through the countryside walkin' in the clover
Making love and playing games to warm winds of summer
Roamin' through the countryside walkin' in the clover
Making love and playing games to warm winds of summer
We'd stop and pick the daffodills when we talked awhile
And when I asked her for a kiss she'd look at me and smiled
And we'd go roamin'...
When the sun was sinking low we'd leave the fields behind
To think about another day for it was summer time
And we'd go roamin'...
Those carefree days have come and gone and now she is my bride
And every Suday afternoon I take her by my side
And we go roamin'... <start> Christmas time's a comin'
Christmas time's a comin'
Christmas time's a comin'
And I know I'm goin' home
Snowflakes a fallin'
My old home's callin'
Tall pines hummin'
Christmas time's a comin'
Can't ya hear them bells ringin' ringin'
Joy joy hear them singin'
When it's snowin' I'll be goin'
Back to my country home
Christmas time's a comin'
Christmas time's a comin'
Christmas time's a comin'
And I know I'm goin' home
Holly's in the window
Home's where the wind blows
Can't walk for runnin'

Can't ya hear them bells ringin' ringin'
Joy joy hear them singin'
When it's snowin' I'll be goin'
Back to my country home

Ha ha here come old Santa Clause hey hey
Christmas time's a comin'
Christmas time's a comin' <start> Black girl black girl tell me where
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines in the pines
Where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
Now little girl little girl what have I done
That made you treat me so
You cause me to weep you cause me to moan
You cause me to leave my home
In the pines in the pines
Where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia line
Saw the engine past at six o'clock
And the cab went bye and bye
In the pines in the pines
Where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows <start> Guys need girls to make 'em feel tough
And girls know how to make guys fall in love
It ain't crazy it's a fact of life
It's all right here in black and white
Baby this story sounds just like us
I'll be the guy that buys you a drink
You'll be the girl that drives me wild with a wink
And a kiss and that last call look this is late
Let's take this outside right now
I'll be the guy begging for one last dance
You'll be the girl that says you missed your chance
Let's take it to the parking lot
And drop the tailgate down
And turn it into a Saturday night
Small town world a cooler of beer
A little truck bed twirl in the moonlight
Guys and girls
Girls give guys that all night rush
And guys give girls that butterfly crush
Like a whiskey shot to the heart
Just two stones make it a spark
Baby don't this sound just like us
I'll be the guy that buys you a drink
You'll be the girl that drives me wild with a wink
And a kiss and that last call look this is late
Let's take this outside right now
I'll be the guy begging for one last dance
You'll be the girl that says you missed your chance
Let's take it to the parking lot
And drop the tailgate down
And turn it into a Saturday night
Small town world a cooler of beer
A little truck bed twirl in the moonlight
Guys and girls
Guy goes out and buys girl a ring
He knows he can't but he swears he'll give her everything
Girl gives a laugh and says I couldn't want more
Guy thanks God for the girl
I'll be the guy that buys you a drink
You'll be the girl that drives me wild with a wink
And a kiss and that last call look this is late
Let's take this outside right now
I'll be the guy begging for one last dance
You'll be the girl that says you missed your chance
Let's take it to the parking lot
And drop the tailgate down
Turn it into a Saturday night
Small town world a cooler of beer
A little truck bed twirl in the moonlight
Guys and girls <start> By now I guess she's wondering how I'm doing
If it broke my heart when she told me goodbye
Well every night I sleep just like a baby
I wake up every hour and cry.
I bet she don't think I'm going miss her
Probably think she's always on my mind
But every night I sleep just like a baby
I wake up every hour and cry.
She believes that I can't live with out her
And it hurts so bad sometimes I almost die
Well every night I sleep just like a baby
I wake up every hour and cry.
You know I'll bet way down deep
That she thinks that I'll always love her
And I'll bet she thinks I'll never love another
No matter how hard I try.
'Cause every night I sleep just like a baby
I wake up every hour and cry.
Lord every night I sleep just like a little bitty baby
I wake up every hour and cry... <start> I think I feel like an old beat up two lane
The one that the state's not about to repair
From where I'm falling I think I might meet you
Below where we were just above just don't care
The way the world's changing I just can't accept it
No right or wrong all in between
The faith we were raised on is weathered and shaken
But baby it don't have to be
Cause I still believe in a prayer before supper
Passing the time round the old courthouse square
We've got nothing to keep us from start over Georgia
We'll leave all the baggage and start over there
Well I've never been to that part of the country
Save for some old movies and deep in my mind
Where it's accepted and even rewarded
To stand on your own right side of the line
Nobody wins here we're all scared of losing
I feel scarred right down to the bone
Maybe we'll find ourselves close to the ocean
Where freedom first breathed on it's own
Cause I still believe in a prayer
Oh we've got nothing to keep us <start> Some hearts out there
Lookin' for the perfect mate
Fool around until it's too late
And true love's passed them by
Some hearts never found out what they're after
Never learned to master
They don't even try
And then they wonder why
Some hearts get all the breaks
Some never feel the old heartache
Some hearts never make mistakes
'Cause they got what it takes
Some hearts get all the breaks
Some eyes look forever
But they never see
The one love that was meant to be
They just sit and cry
Some hearts reach out but never hold you
Although they may enfold you
They never really try
And then they wonder why
Some hearts get all the breaks
Some never feel the old heartache
Some hearts never make mistakes
'Cause they got what it takes
Some hearts get all the breaks
Some hearts get all the breaks
Some never feel the old heartache
Some hearts never make mistakes
'Cause they got what it takes
Some hearts get all the breaks <start> Now you may not feel like dancing
Or getting up at all
You may not be in the mood
To heed my beckoned call
When that guitar starts to get you
Squirming in your seat
Might as well just give it up
And get up on your feet
'Cause you can't sit still
When that music starts to play
No you can't sit still
Oh don't throw the urge away
And you can't sit still
When that music starts to play
Now you can't sit still
So don't throw the urge away
Just let that rhythm take you up
And out across that floor
Grab some Incomprehensible and boogie down
'Cause you can't sit still no more
Can't you feel it Bill
Oh don't you know you can't sit still
You were caught all week long now
And you know it's Friday night
You're gonna lay down your hard earned money
And you bought yourself a ride
So put your arm around her
And show her once again
What it was about your rock 'n' roll
She was agrooving on way back when
'Cause you can't sit still
When that music starts to play
No you can't sit still
Oh don't throw the urge away
You can't sit still
When that music starts to play
No you can't sit still
So don't throw the urge away
Just let that rhythm take you up
Out across that floor
Grab some Incomprehensible and boogie down
'Cause you can't sit still no more
Can't you feel it Bill
Oh you know you can't sit still
Can't you feel it Bill
Oh you know you can't sit still oh yeah <start> Sunset a clear blue lake
Fishing with the boys
A weekend hanging out with my best friends
Tall tales and ice cold beer
Well I can't blame you guys
For saying this must be the living end
Chorus
Hold on it does get better than this
If you were me
You couldn't disagree
'Cause I've held her oh so tight
She's kept me up all night
I've tasted her kisses sweet as wine
Sure this is a real good time
But pardon me boys
It does get better than this
Cool night by the fire
At least a million stars
A cooler full of fat catfish to fry
Back slapping telling jokes
And howling at the moon
I hear you saying Ain't this
The life but
Chorus
She showed me what the
Good life really means
I know you've had a love like hers
Yeah in your dreams
Chorus
Oh I'm telling you now boys
It does get better than this. <start> Strawberry shimmer on hot lips silver buckle hangin' off her hips
I sparkle when she smiles shine down on the radio dial
Homemade jar lemmon drop take a sip. Don't stop girl you know I love it when you
Get your shine on

Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on

Ridin' high roll up on the down low
Feelin' lucky got hooked up with some Kentucky clear
So slide that little sugar shaker over here and

Turn your party lights on

Baby get your shine on. <start> I stood out on the trestle waitin' for the whistle
The  was right on time again
Lord I'd agot a lickin' if they caught me playin' chicken
But I was quite the practiced liar way back then
I saw the smoke above the treetops
And when the train came into view
I stood still as a statue but I knew what to do
When I could read the numbers on the front
I'd run like a gypsy like the hounds of hell'd get me
Like a rabbit on the wrong end of a gun
I'd run like the lightning cuttin' 'cross the Kansas skyline
Like the tears that momma cried for her lost son
I'd run yeah I'd run
I got older but no smarter an' cheatin' fate got harder
But I could still out wit the Devil and his friends
Went through whiskey cards an' women takin' more than I was givin'
Throwin' love and caution to wind
Every time I'd let some beauty get a little too close to me
She'd hang around just long enough to find herself the key
When I could feel the lock on my heart come undone
I'd run like a gypsy like the hounds of hell'd get me
Like a rabbit on the wrong end of a gun
I'd run like the lightning cuttin' 'cross the Kansas skyline
Like the tears that momma cried for her lost son
I'd run yeah I'd run
There's broken hearts and broken bottles
Dreams all gone to dust
Girls gone home to momma and cars all gone to rust
If I could go back and undo the hurt I'd done
I'd run like a gypsy like the hounds of hell'd get me
Like the rabbit on the wrong end of a gun
I'd run like the lightning cuttin' 'cross the Kansas skyline
Like the tears that momma cried for her lost son
I'd run yeah I'd run you know I'd run yeah I'd run <start> There was a time when you were mine and my heart knew no pain
But since that time sweetheart I find there's been an awful change
The love I knew has proved untrue and now we're far apart
No matter how you treat me now you'll still be in my heart
I understand your many plans I brought you wealth and pride
With all your gold when love is cold you'll be dissatisfied
You were untrue because you knew I love you from the start
Though you'll find bliss in another's kiss you'll still be in my heart
 guitar 
I can't erase the lovely face no matter how I try
When friends we knew just mention you I hang my head and cry
You turned me down because you found you play the leadin' part
Those lonely years I'll spend in tears you'll still be in my heart
My one request when I lay to rest the future has in store
On that sad day beneath the clay to sleep forever more
Should you be there in deep despair when burning teardrops start
Please don't forget I love you yet you'll still be in my heart <start> Well when I get home day's been rough
Gimme all your company
And when I get low and I've had enough
Gimme all your sympathy
And when I need your love
I need it all day all night anyway is all right
I ain't sayin' nothin' new
Gimme you gimme you only you
Honey you
You know all you gotta do is gimme
Gimme gimme you
And if I've been bad done you wrong
Gimme time to make it right
Honey don't be mad 'cause it takes
Too long
And we ain't got time to fight
And when I need your love
I need it all right right now gonna get
It anyhow
I ain't sayin' nothin' new
Gimme you gimme you only you
Honey you
You know all you gotta do is gimme
Gimme gimme you
Gimme you gimme you only you
You know all you gotta do is gimme
Gimme gimme you <start> It's ten PM and I should have made the road tonight
The moon was out and the clouds came in and took it's light
My suitcase is over there somehow I just don't care
Cause I don't want to be anywhere but right here tonight
The rains came down and I should have made an early plane
Where I'd rather be if it can't be seen then I can't explain
It's so warm in here and I want to hold you near
And there is no pain or fear right here tonight
With tomorrows dawn I will carry on what I've set aside
It's not a matter of my faith or of my pride
It just seems so insane to strike out in the rain
When it's so easy to remain right here tonight <start> Well if you're traveling to the North Country Fair
Where the wind's heavy on the borderline
Remember me to the one who lives there she once was a true love of mine
If you go to the snowflakes storm where the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see she has a coat so warm to keep her from the howling wind
 banjo 
Please see if her hair hangs long if it tose and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair's hangin' long that's the way I remember her best
If you're traveling...
She once was a true love of mine <start> Im back in the saddle again
Out where a friend is a friend
Where the longhorn cattle feed
On the lowly gypsum weed
Back in the saddle again
Ridin the range once more
Totin my old .
Where you sleep out every night
And the only law is right
Back in the saddle again
Whoopityayeoh
Rockin to and fro
Back in the saddle again
Whoopityayeyay
I go my way
Back in the saddle again
Im back in the saddle again
Out where a friend is a friend
Where the longhorn cattle feed
On the lowly gypsum weed
Back in the saddle again
Ridin the range once more
Totin my old .
Where you sleep out every night
And the only law is right
Back in the saddle again
Whoopityayeoh
Rockin to and fro
Back in the saddle again
Whoopityayeyay
I go my way
Back in the saddle again <start> They say a woman's a fool for weeping
A fool to break her own heart
But I can't hold the secret I'm keeping
I'm breaking apart
Can't seem to mind my own business
Whatever I try turns out wrong
I seem like my own false witness
And I can't go on
I cover my ears I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies
You told me you needed my company
And I believed in your flattering ways
You told me you needed me forever
Nearly gave you the rest of my days
Should've seen you for what you are
Should never have come back for more
Should've locked up all my silver
Brought the key right to your door
I cover my ears I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies
You don't know what a chance is
Until you have to seize one
You don't know what a man is
Until you have to please one
Don't put your life in the hands of a man
With a face for every season
Don't waste your time in the arms of a man
Who's no stranger to treason
I cover my ears I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies <start> I often dream of trains when I'm alone
I ride on them into another zone
I dream of them constantly
Heading for paradise
Or Basingstoke
Or Reading
I often dream of trains when I'm awake
They ride along beside a frozen lake
And there in the buffet car
I wait for eternity
Or Basingstoke
Or Reading
I often dream of trains till it gets light
The summer turns to winter overnight
The leaves fall so suddenly
The sun sets at four o'clock
Exactly what
I'm dreading
I often dream of trains when I'm with you
I wonder if you dream about them too
Maybe we'll meet one night
Out in the corridor
I'm waiting for
You baby
Baby
Baby
Baby
Baby... <start> Chorus
This heart of stone sure is missing you
Sure is wishing you were back where love belongs
This heart of stone has not forgotten you
But broke while trying to pretend that it was strong
Memories have made its will grow tired and weak
Silently it turned from being bold to meek
'Til finally it gave into a sad defeat
Aching more and more with every fragile beat
Chorus
Loneliness has slowly stripped it of its pride
Leaving just an empty well here behind
Without a hope of any way it could survive
Stranded there alone and simply left to die <start> FACE TO THE WALL

' Moss Rose Publications
RECORDED BY FARON YOUNG
Was I farther from your conscience standing face to the wall
I suspected there was something that you weren't telling me
And last night I learned the reason for it all
I was looking through your window saw you kissing someone else
You reached up and turned my picture slowly face to the wall
Face to the wall so you wouldn't have to see
Anything at all to make you think of me
Did the cheapness of the moment make you feel ashamed and small
Was I farther from your conscience standing face to the wall
Alone out in the darkness were the eyes that worshipped you
As you cheated me I watched my idle fall
With your arms around another and his lips where mine should be
Then I saw you turned my picture slowly face to the wall
Face to the wall... <start> There are stars in the southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the seven bridges road
I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild
Sometimes there is a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Runnin' like a child from these warm stars
Down the seven bridges road
There are stars in the southern sky
And if ever you decide you should go
There is a taste of time sweet as honey
Down the seven bridges road
There are stars in the southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the seven bridges road
Down the seven bridges road <start> This is my prairie this is my home
I'll make my stand here and I'll die alone
They can drill they can mine o'er my smoldering bones
'Cause this is my prairie this is my home
The water is poison my calves are all dead
My children are sick and the aquifer's bled
They want a big pipeline right through Pop's grove
This is my prairie this is my home
I can't blame the riggers or the guys drivin' truck
For feedin' their families and makin' a buck
But take a close look at the stock that you own
'Cause this is my prairie this is my home
I don't got the money that lawyers can buy
I don't got my own government's laws on my side
But I got this old rifle that my grand daddy owned
And this is my prairie this is my home <start> As pure as a kiss from the lips of god
A red rose bloomin' out a canyon rock
Through a hole in the clouds she fell one day
And left her home on high so far away
From the day she came into this world
There were tears in the eyes of that baby girl
We tried everything to heal the hurt
But she never could find peace on earth
So goodbye farewell homesick angel
May heaven shores be a sight for your sore eyes
Oh I wish you well homesick angel
Yeah I just wish we'd had more time
From a hillside grave a preacher writes
Who could blame that girl for rushing back
Who amongst once had seen that place
Would ever wanna step foot outside those gates
So goodbye farewell homesick angel
May heaven shores be a sight for your sore eyes
Oh I wish you well homesick angel
Yeah I just wish we'd had more time
God is God and I'm just a man
So I guess I'll never understand
But the fire inside that lights my faith
Is a smile I see upon her face
When I hold her again that day
So goodbye farewell homesick angel
May heaven shores be a sight for your sore eyes
Oh I wish you well homesick angel
Yeah I just wish we'd had more time
Yeah I just wish we'd had more time <start> City sidewalks
Busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing
People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear
Chorus
Silver bells silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring a ling ring a ling
Hear them ring hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
 Instrumental 
Chorus
Silver bells silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring a ling ring a ling
Hear them ring hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
Soon it will be Christmas day... <start> Dusty Smiles and heartbreak cures
Cannot fix what you endure.
Saw you leavin' again today
Gettin' out the cowards way.
Saw you leavin on a train
Not knowing what your gonna gain.
Until you've worked out a way
Your not coming home to stay
CHORUS
Honey your smile makes me cry
And now I've stopped asking why
The day you leave me for sure
Is when I stop asking for more.
Why do you run away from life
leaving wrinkles underneath my eyes.
When you talk I'm never sure
Why your running for the door.
CHORUS
The day you leave me for sure
Is when I'll stop asking for more. <start> I've been loving you too long it's time I sang a different song
You've been stringing me along I've been loving you too long
I've been clinging like a vine but I'm gonna take the time
To find where I belong I've been loving you too long
Babe I'm not saying that I've stopped loving you
That it won't be hard to say goodbye
I may never get your lovin' out of my head but I'm just saying that I've gotta try
I've been loving you too long...
 dobro 
No one owns another one and that's what you try
You tried to own me body mind and soul
Love to you's a oneway street all coming your way
But always givin's gettin' kind of gold
I've been loving you too long... <start> I have thought I was a big big man much too big to cry
Then I fell in love with you thought you loved me too then you said goodbye
I can't forget the day that you walked away from your love I'll never be free
You're making great big tears out of little bitty tears where no tears used to be
One little tear two little tears that's the way it started
Three big tears four big tears they kept getting larger
Now there's so many tears in my eyes that I can hardly see
You're making great big tears out of little bitty tears where no tears used to be
 ac.guitar 
I wish I could count my tears but I can't count that high
There just seems to be no limit to all the tears I cry
I only hope someday the tears will wash away all the hurt inside of me
You're making great big tears out of little bitty tears where no tears used to be
You're making great big tears out of little bitty tears where no tears used to be <start> I don't claim to be an angel my life's been full of sin
But when I met you darling that all came to an end
Never doubt my love dear whatever you may do
I don't claim to be an angel but my love for you is true
You'll hear talk around town of things I used to do
Some will try to poison your mind that my love can't be true
Many nights I lay awake dear hoping our love will last
Wondering if your love is strong enough to forget about my past
I don't claim to be an angel unverified
I never knew what real love was till you came along
You changed my outlook on life made me regret my wrongs
Why should my past keep haunting me all through the years
I paid for each mistake with millions of bitter tears
I don't claim to be an angel unverified <start> Without your glasses you just plain can't see
You favorite color for the most part is green
You're close to your grandma on your mother's side
You can count up on one hand the times you have lied
You won't eat a tomato on a doubledog dare
You don't think you're a beauty but you do like your hair
Your complex and tricky yet someways you're not
You're up some you're down some
You're cold and you're hot
And who's gonna end up holdin' your hand
A beautiful woman or a tall handsome man
There's no doubt they'll love you but it's yet to be seen
Will anyone ever know you like me
Will anyone ever know you like me
You like plantin' flowers that's heaven to you
Crack open a beer when you're planting through
You'll paint all your toenails if you have time
while listening to Willie Dylan and Pride
And who's gonna end up holdin' your hand
A beautiful woman or a tall handsome man
There's no doubt they'll love you but it's yet to be seen
Will anyone ever know you like me
You'd rather makeout then make love all night
You like if your bath is too hot
Your closet is cluttered with dress pants and Levis that you wish you'd never bought
And who's gonna end up holdin' your hand
A beautiful woman or a tall handsome man
There's no doubt they'll love you but it's yet to be seen
Will anyone ever know you like me
Will anyone ever know you like me <start> Hold back the rushing minutes make the wind lie still
Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill
Dry all the raindrops hold back the sun
The world has ended my baby's gone
I'll wake up almost every night and realize you're gone
I'll toss and turn and stare at darkness waiting for the dawn
I try to tell my lonely heart we'll make it alone
But it cries the world has ended oh my baby's gone
Hold back the rushing minutes make the wind lie still
Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill
Dry all the raindrops hold back the sun
Don't they know the world has ended my baby's gone
Don't they know the world has ended oh my baby's gone <start> I Am Flat Dead On My Feet
I Have Had Nothing To Eat
I Am Sick Of Highways And Cold Hotels Rooms
I Have Replay There In Our Soft Bed
I Am So Tired Of Missing You
So Let's Turn Out The Lights

And Lay Here By My Side

Give Me The Lose That I Need
Baby Let's Love Some Sleep Tonight
All These Shows That I Play
Take Me So Far Away
I Know That I Have Negleated Your Needs
You Have Been Tested And Trialed
Stuck Firm By My Side
Waiting Patiently For The Man Of Your Needs
So Let's Turn Out The Lights

And Lay Here By My Side

Give Me The Love That I Need
Baby Let's Lose Some Sleep Tonight

Sweetheart One Night Together
Is Not Nearly Enough
We Need The Rest Of Forever Making Up For Lost Love
So Let's Turn Out The Lights

Lay Here By My Side

Give You The Love That You Need
Let's Lose Some Sleep Tonight
The Love That I Need
Baby Let's Lose Some Sleep Tonight <start> Trouble more trouble can you get anymore
Slow bubble boiling on the bedroom floor
Lonely ain't lonely someone calling at the door
Someone lovely and she's bringing bad news
She clenches and she cries and she lays on the stairs
Pounding on the earth and yanking at her hairs
And showing such fear at being found unawares
To be here and be bringing bad news
Well something bad happens and a lot of people go
Bad themselves that's how awful it is
Turning half the heart into something hard and dark
And she had to bring here this
Well she's told Hold your buttons and look at the sky
Someone will fix things if you let your face dry
Keep your face near the earth and your heart beat high
And you may transcend the bad news
Well something bad happens and a lot of people go
Bad themselves that's how awful it is
Turning half the heart into something hard and dark
And she had to bring here this
For all hammers and nails
For all leaves and winds
For all love ambitions
And enemies and friends
She shakes her face so fiercely that all her features go
She lays like a monkey unclothed in the snow
And her voice it decays and before it does she goes
I will never again deliver bad news
Something bad happens and a lot of people go
Bad themselves that's how awful it is
Turning half the heart into something hard and dark
And she had to bring here this
Mm hey little bird hey little bird
Thank you for not letting go of me when I let go of you
Hey little bird hey little bird
Thank you for not letting go of me when I let go of you

Thank you for not  <start> It wasn't very long ago
We had a love few people know
And everything was going oh so fine
I trusted you you trusted me
The way that it's supposed to be
But love slipped from us somewhere down the line
We had all of the good things going baby
You know we did everything was fine
Enjoying the taste of the good life
We all look for but few can find
It's gone but we can't understand
How luck could slip right through our hands
All down the line things seemed so very right
The love we shared through all these years
We both knew that we were sincere
Then suddenly it left just overnight
We had all of the good things going baby
You know we did everything was fine
Enjoying the taste of the good life
We all look for but few can find
Now that we've gone our separate ways
I still recall those brighter days
Days that didn't seem so very long
Neither of us ought to blame
We overly know that it's a shame
And all that we had going now is gone
We had all of the good things going baby
You know we did everything was fine
Enjoying the taste of the good life
We all look for but few can find <start> lyrics by Corb Lund and Mike Plume music by Corb Lund
He's been roundin off bolts since the age of fourteen
Was that a five eighths or a nine sixteenths
He's got a metric socket that don't quite fit
Well it'll wiggle just a little but it aint quite stripped
The safety guards gone from his grinding machine
He got a stiff paint brush he only kinda got clean
He's the hired man my neighbor and a cousin in law
He's a jerry riggin fool he got the tool for the job
Well it's vise grips for pliers and pliers for a wrench
A wrench for a hammer hammers everything else
It just dont seem to make much difference
I sure do like him but hes hard on equipment
I sure like you son but youre hard on equipment
His corners aint square and his floor aint level
And he's always had trouble with the old tape measure
His doors dont close cause the jamb aint plumb
And hes a Goddamn menace with an air nail gun
They love to see him comin at the lumberyard store
Fixed the leak in his roof with a two by four
Drilled holes in his boards with the wrong kinda bit
And when they dont line up he blames the government
He got the whole front yard full of fix em up cars
Three dont run and the rest wont start
Everything's fine with his rebuilt motor
Except of course for the couple spare parts left over
Baler wire tie downs goin down the road
On two bald tires and an oversize load
He ain't never read a manual cause that's like cheatin
He don't mind a little grease on his hands while he's eatin
Hes got busted up knuckles his thumb got bruised
Jesus Christ was a carpenter too <start> Well now cowboys love the ladies they like beans and sour dough
Good horses and hot black coffee and camp fires burnin' low
You know we love that cowboy music but I'll bet you didn't know
That even cowboys like just a little rock and roll
Even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll
Yeah we all got some boogie woogie in our soul
There's a little bit of Buddy Holly in every cowboy that I know
And even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll
Now when you're camped out on the prairie and that ole moon is shinin' bright
And you can hear them cattle bawlin' soft and low
There's nothin' like a cowboy song to make it all feel just right
But even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll
Even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll
Yeah we all got some boogie woogie in our soul
There's a little bit of Chuck Berry in every cowboy that I know
And even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll
Now those old buckaroos are set in their ways and they'll even tell you so
Say they don't like nothin' but them old time cowboy songs
Yeah but I've seen that green grass growin' underneath that winter snow
I'll bet them old cowboys even like a little rock and roll
Even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll
Yeah we all got some boogie woogie in our soul
There's a little bit of Charlie Daniels in every cowboy that I know
And even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll <start> No day passes by no night without cry my whole world is hurt from now on
Each minute reveals heartbreak so real my whole world is hurt from now on
And if I try to forget a just plain misery
I'm more confused and emptiness right here inside of me
And no future's bright out go those lights
My whole world is hurt from now on
And if I try to forget a just plain misery <start> It don't matter to the sun
If you go or if you stay
I know the sun is gonna rise
Shine down on another day
There will still be a tomorrow
Even if you choose to leave
'Cause it don't matter to the sun 
It matters to me
It ain't gonna stop the world
If you walk out that door
This old world will just keep on turning 'round 
Like it did the day before
'Cause see to them it makes no difference 
It just keeps on keepin' time
'Cause it ain't gonna stop the world 
But it'll be the end of mine
What can I say
What can I do
I'm still in love
So without you...

Mmm mmm mmm oh yeah oh yeah
What can I say
What can I do
I'm still in love
So without you <start> I'm holdin' to the Lord
I'm holdin' to the Lord
Oh if I could I surely would stand on the rock
Where Moses stood
Sinners run and hide your face
Sinners run and hide your face
Go runnin' to the rock and hide your face
Lord I ain't no stranger now
I'm holdin' to the Lord
I'm holdin' to the Lord
Oh if I could I surely would stand on the rock
Where Moses stood
Lord I ain't no stranger now
Lord I ain't no stranger now
I've introduced to and followed in the sun
Lord I ain't no stranger now <start> Written by billy burnette.
I miss you darling
In a heartbreakin way
If I could I'd be calling
You home to stay
I could hardly stand it
When you walked on the plane
I didn't think I could take it
Almost went insane
As I read your letters
I felt so much closer to you
I'll feel a whole lot better
When I'm side by side with you <start> Hope you like the way I talk
The way I smile the way I walk
Hope you're in to how I dress
The way I think
And all the rest  'cause
I'm gonna get you
You're gonna love me
No doubt about it
I'm gonna get you
When you're driftin' off to sleep
Close your eyes and think of me
Make it easy on yourself
Don't dream about
Nobody else  'cause
I'm gonna get you
You're gonna love me
No doubt about it
I'm gonna get you
You can run and you can hide
But in the end you'll realize
You've been runnin' right to me
Turn around
And there I'll be
I'm gonna get you
You're gonna love me
No doubt about it
I'm gonna get you
It ain't a matter of chance
Honey it's destiny
There ain't no getting' away
It's just the way it's gonna be
I'm gonna get you
You're gonna love me
No doubt about it
I'm gonna get you <start> I lit my love and watched it burn
Asking nothing in return.
Except the lessons I will learn.
From holding crazy faith.
I've been touched by that bright fire.
Down to the root of my desire
While the smoke it rises higher.
Glowing crazy faith.
You're not asking if I love this man.
I know you don't you don't believe you can.
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan.
It's crazy I know but my faith says so
It tells me.
Am I a fool for hanging long
Would I be a fool for being long gone.
When is daylight gonna dawn
On my crazy faith.
The questions will not let me sleep
The dance is buried way too deep.
But the bottom lover lover's keep
Made by crazy faith.
You're not asking if I love this man.
I know you don't you don't believe you can.
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan.
It's crazy I know but my faith says so
It tells me.
Love you're losin' those you love
Let the hope fly from the glove.
Do not search the skies above.
Search your crazy faith.
Love is lightning love is ice.
It only strikes the lucky twice.
Once or you will know the price.
And once for crazy faith.
You're not asking if I love this man.
I know you don't you don't believe you can.
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan.
It's crazy I know but my faith says so. <start> Adrienne Young
Pretty Ella Arkansas
Birthed  daughters and a son
She was a sure shot with a pistol
And here bare feet loved to run
There was raven hair and brown skin
Green eyes and a crooked smile
There were freckles on her shoulders
From sunkissed country miles
Well her Papa died in prison
The day she turned 
Set Ella free from a life of sin
When he got that old TB
Ellad never known her Mama
cept for that picture on the wall
Oh but she blessed her in her prayers each night
Knowin someday she would call
Pretty Ella Arkansas
Dangdest thing I ever saw
Racing with a northbound freight
Choose your car and jump inside
Keep the faith and hold on tight
Everythings gonna be alright
For pretty Ella Arkansas
Just keep following the light
Was in the heat of that same summer
When she met her childrens Pa
At a downtown dance in Hot Springs
Sweat and rhythm filled the hall
When Miller Jacobs saw our girl
He had to blink and rub his eyes
Thought the whiskey must be playin tricks
Or there was an angel in disguise
Pretty Ella Arkansas
Dangdest thing I ever saw
Racing with a northbound freight
Choose your car and jump inside
Keep the faith and hold on tight
Everythings gonna be alright
For pretty Ella Arkansas
Just keep following the light
It happened so fast
Winter blew past
The bride she was dressed in all white
Pretty Ella Arkansas
Birthed  daughters and a son
Became the Mother shed always wished shed had
Lived ripe and full to 
Old Miller Jacobs loved that girl
And when they laid herin the ground
Everybody knew hed be following soon
As the rain came pourindown
Pretty Ella Arkansas
Dangdest thing I ever saw
Racing with a northbound freight
Choose your car and jump inside
Keep the faith and hold on tight
Everythings gonna be alright
For pretty Ella Arkansas
Just keep following the light <start> If the wild bird could speak
She'd tell of places you had been
She's been in my dreams
And she knows all the ways of the wind
Chorus
Polly come home again
Spread your wings to the wind
I felt much of the pain
As it begins
Dreams cover much time
Still they leave blind
The will to begin
I searched for you there
And now look for you from within
Chorus <start> I see the town where we were born I see the place we were raised
I see all the things you wanted that I never gave
I see sadness I see sorrow I see pain on your face
But I just can't see a stranger in my place
I can see now where we quarreled I can see now I was wrong
I can see where you might weaken and I wasn't strong
I see mem'ries of a love gone bad that time cannot erase
But I just can't see a stranger in my place
No one seems to know you quite like I do no one knows the things that make you cry
And looking back it seems I never showed you and now I lay alone and wonder why
I can see now where you might grow tired of dreams that don't come true
I can see where I have fallen short of the things I promised you
I can see now through my tear filled eyes no love on your face
But I still can't see a stranger in my place <start> Two lovers stood in the white white sand
A darkeyed maiden and her tall lover man
With surprise and pain in her eyes
She clung to the hand of her tall lover man
They're lyin' to me aren't they Jim
She asked him
That fairhaired girl with those blue blue eyes
Is not your wife is she Jim
And with tears in her eyes and her sad sad cries
She clung to the hand of her tall lover man
In the darkness he let go of her hand
I'm not to blame it was a game
'Cause that fairhaired woman is my wife
And she will be all of my life
You're lyin' to me aren't you Jim she asked him
If lovin' me was a sport then your life shall be short
She said to him my Jim
And the blade of the maid struck the man
And the blood flowed in the sand from her tall lover man
Two lovers lyin' in the white white sand
I'll die with you my tall lover man
And her blade found its mark in the dark
She clung to the hand of her tall lover man
They're lyin' to me aren't they Jim she asked him
That fairhaired girl won't be your wife
And with tears in her eyes and sad sad cries
She died in the sand with her tall lover man <start> Snow up on the mountains
Sun lay low across the cloudy sky
I've been feeding this far for so long
The fame is gone
I can second guess the storm
'till my heart 
But I'll just stay inside
There's no way that I'll take any chances of my own
What if I get it wrong
Another season come and gone
Proving hard to sing a song
For too few summer skies
All the tourists barely even say goodbye
Back again
Now there's lovers all around
Just some  will lay down
I don't to like
It won't be my eyes
That tell me if they found
Fair weather friends
What ever happened to the change of seasons
What ever happened to all my reasons
To open up my heart and let it be
What ever happened to falling in love
What ever happened to me
Sun up on the mountains
Somebody said it happen yesterday
But I guess I can't remember back that far
It's not all there
But the sky was probably blue
Doesn't matter when to view
Depends on where you are
What kind of heart you might be looking through
Or if you can 
What ever happened to the change of seasons
What ever happened to all my reasons
To open up my heart and let it be
What ever happened to falling in love
What ever happened to me
What ever happened to the change of seasons
What ever happened to all my reasons
To open up my heart and let it be
What ever happened to falling in love
What ever happened to me
What ever happened to the change of seasons
What ever happened to all my reasons
Oh just let it be
What ever happened to falling in love
What ever happened to me
Does anyone remember me
What ever happened to falling in love
What ever happened to me <start> New York City ain't no kind of place
For a country girl with a friendly face
If you smile people look at you funny they take it wrong
The greenest state in the land of the free
And the home of the Grand Ole Opry
Is calling me back to my Smoky Mountain home
I wish I had my old fishin' pole
And was sitting on the banks of the fishing hole
Eating green apples and waiting for the fish to bite
Life ain't as simple as it used to be
Just since the big apple took a bite out of me
And Lord I'm so Tennessee homesick that I could die
But I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
What I wouldn't give for a little bitty taste
Of Mama's homemade chocolate cake
Tennessee homesick blues is running through my head
Mama you can fluff my feather bed
Just as soon as I can I'm gonna head
Back to the Tennessee hills and it better be soon
Daddy you can load the rifles up
We're gonna load them dogs on the pickup truck
And head up to Calhoun Country and catch us a coon
But I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
Eatin' grits and gravy and country ham
Go to church on Sunday with dinner on the grounds
Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head
And I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
Good Lord have mercy on a country girl
Tryin' to make a living in a rhinestone world
It's hard to be a diamond in a rhinestone world
With Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head
I've got those Tennessee homesick blues runnin' through my head
Tennessee homesick blues <start> My arms were made to hold you my lips were made to kiss you
My heart was made to know you I was born to be in love with you
My hands were made to touch you my eyes were made to see you
My heart was made to know you I was born to be in love with you
I don't care how they talk about you I don't care what they say
Nothing they do can make me doubt you I'm with you all the way
My arms were made to hold you my lips were made to kiss you
My heart was made to know you I was born to be in love with you
I don't care how they talk about you
I was born to be in love with you <start> Were you there when they crucified my Lord
Were you there when they crucified my Lord
Oh sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble tremble
Were you there when they crucified my Lord
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree
Oh sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble tremble
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree
Were you there when they pierced him in his side
Were you there when they pierced him in his side
Oh sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble tremble
Were you there when they pierced him in his side
Were you there when the sun refused to shine
Were you there when the sun refused to shine
Oh sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble tremble
Were you there when the sun refused to shine
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb
Oh sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble tremble
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb <start> Way back in the mountains
Way back in the hills
There used to live a mountaineer
They called him Fiddlin' Will
He could play most anything
And some say he could sing
But the one thing that he liked to do best
Was sawing on the strings
So get out the fiddle
And rosin up the bow
Look at ol' Will apattin' his toe
We'll make music till the rafters ring
All that pickin' and a sawin' on the string
When the neighbors had a shindig
And they all had vittles to eat
We'd always have to wait on Will
To make the frolic complete
When he comes down from the mountain
All the gals began to sway
Sometimes he'd pick that ol' fivestring
Until the break of day
So tune up the fivestring
Tighten up the hide
Tell all the hill folks to get inside
All them pickin' and asawing on the string <start> I live in an Ice house a
I never do dance salsa
I'm living in Jamaica
I live in an Ice Breaker
I'm living in Africa
I never do Know where a
Where I'm living but I'm living in a free fall
Whenever she goes away
Might as well be in San Jose
'Cause I never can tell where my
Where my heart's gonna spend it's time
Half of me's missing
I miss her Kissing
I don't know nothing but I know
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
My head is a hurricane
My mind is a touch insane
and my body can't sleep to dream
And my Eyes open up to scream
And my mouth is a thin straight line
As I'm struggling to pass the time
And my crime is that I'm living life without her
And the morning soon will come
And the days nearly almost done
And the clock says it's half past five
But the sun is still in the sky
Disorientated
Insatiated
How long I've waited but I know <start> I am a soldier I'm a slave of power
Power so great that it can destroy God's world with one mighty blast
I'm a machine a computer an engine programed to reap destruction wherever I go
I'm a bad risk for my credit is only backed up by the United States Government
My reputation is that of a braggard a sex fied a cheat and rusted hero
I'm a killer paid and trained to hit first before being hit and I do
I'm a soldier so who cares how dirty the job is if it has to be done then it's done
Right but I'm also a human being I am myself good or bad
I smell the flowers in the spring I hear the birds sing in the early morning
I feel the warmth of a fire in the winter and I feel the rain as it moinstens my brow
I'm a part of family with God as my father and me the obediest child
I have wants and needs and I have the strength and the faith to fullfill them
And I have passion the kind of passion that brings forth a love so great
That no war no tragedy or no other being could ever destroy
I'm a human being and I feel I feel the things all around me
And I'm grateful I'm so very grateful
I'm also an American and I'm proud
I'm proud because I have the right to worship God as my Master
The right to love a wife children mother and father
Without the fear of political reprisal
My country gives me the right to build to destroy
And to rebuild to better proportisions
I am an American I have the right to listen the Star Spangled Banner
The right to feel a chill throughout my entire body when I look at the flag our flag
I have the right to defend to honor to pay tribute
To the great ones who've come and gone before why
Because I'm an American and because I'm an American I can also cry
I can cry for my lost brother who died defending our way of life
I am an American and I'm proud proud because I am <start> Now it all begins or continues to
Spiral down spiral down
I've laid it out on paper
Instructions of what to do
As my mind begins to waver
Losing contact with you
Now it all begins or continues to
Spiral down spiral down
Look upon the self
Look upon the other
We need a better understanding
Now we'll spiral down
Spiral down
Continue to spiral down
I'm no where near my peace
As you spiral down
Now it all begins or continues to
I'm no where near my peace
As you spiral down
I'm no where near my peace
As you spiral down <start> We were shoveling sunshine
The hard times were the good times
In the back of a good times van
Wedding ring was fresh on your hand
I guess you were a little shy
When you gave me some nipple pie
Reached over and you grabbed my wood
Don't you know that it felt so good
And with you is where I belong
That's why I sing this honeymoon song
Well I spilled my red wine
Right below your pantyline
I finally got your bra undone
My Johnson was on the run
Your head was a keepin' time
You were blowin' more than my mind
I was slapping' on your behind
Parked in the bush doing sixty nine
Honey with you I can do no wrong
That's why I sing this honeymoon song
Your nails were digging in
Your teeth were biting skin
Then you pulled out a big black whip
Took me on some love slave trip
I was screaming for my life
Whatever happened to my wife
Said to call you Madam X
That ain't no country boy sex
You beat me black and blue for so long
I guess its my fate this honeymoon song
You locked the doors on the Chevy van
Slapped the cuffs on my hands
I couldn't even try to shout
You strapped a red ball in my mouth
I was thinking about the wedding vows
How that's a bad idea now
I was thinking about death do us part
Buddy that's a bad place to start
And oh where has my sunshine gone
It's too late it's my honeymoon song
Oh my God it's my honeymoon song <start> If time has no end and if time has no end
A billion years a trillion years what then is infinity
A circle an eternal loop
It can drive you crazy searching for the truth
Someday will we know all about it
Have no reason to doubt it
Someday
Before we were babies
There's nothing we recall and when we go back
Will it fade to black and that's all
Or could we be destined for some other time and place
And have we lived other lives our memories have erased
Someday will we know all about it
Have no reason to doubt it
Someday
Will we see Jesus comin' as the sunshine fills the night
Or when we die will we fly into the light
Will we all be reunited with the ones who've gone away
And will we love each other the way we do today I believe
Someday we'll know all about it
Have no reason to doubt it
Someday <start> Nothin' on earth that'll get me hummin'
Like a heat wave comin' and I'll come runnin'
With her makin' that tan in the broad daylight
And every night is a Saturday night
And everything's right with the summer comin'
I'm the first one standin' in line
For my day in the sun I've been workin'
'Til the sun don't shine.
Takin' off my hat leave it to the boys
Get that old work monkey down off my back
All I want's a little peace and noise
Hit the cruise control
Get me back on track
Let my old Ford treat me like a Cadillac.
Nothin' on Earth that'll get me hummin'
Like a heat wave comin' and I'll come runnin'
With her makin' that tan in the broad daylight
And every night is a Saturday night
And everything's right with the summer comin'
I'm the first one standin' in line
For my day in the sun I've been workin'
'Til the sun don't shine.
When the day gets cookin' gonna grab my toys
And it really doesn't matter which wave we're on
Get to turnin' up them good old boys
Crankin' into the night by the break of dawn
All the towns are red and I still see blonde.
Nothin' on Earth that'll get me hummin'
Like a heat wave comin' and I'll come runnin'
With her makin' that tan in the broad daylight
And every night is a Saturday night.
And everything's right with the summer comin'
I'm the first one standin' in line
For my day in the sun I've been workin'
'Til the sun don't shine.
For my day in the sun I've been workin'
'Til the sun don't shine.
For my day in the sun I've been workin'
'Til the sun don't shine.
Summer's comin' to shine.
Summer's comin' to shine.
Summer's comin' <start> Beautiful dreamer wake unto me
Starlight and dewdrops are waiting for Thee
Sounds of the rude world heard in the day
Loved by the moonlight have all passed away
Beautiful dreamer queen of my song
List while I woo Thee with soft melody

Gone are the cares of life's busy throng
Beautiful dreamer awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer out on the sea
Mermaids are chaunting the wild lorelie
Over the streamlet vapors are born
Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn
Beautiful dreamer beam on my heart
E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea

Then will all clouds of sorrow depart
Beautiful dreamer awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer awake unto me <start> I don't know why I left

But I know it won't be long

No it won't be long

Til I get back home
They gave me a green uniform
And black boots for my feet
 and wild as hell
I thought it would be neat
They put me on a plane
To some strange foreign land
I said goodbye to Mom and Dad
And hello to Uncle Sam
Chorus
Once I was a soldier
Not afraid to die
But now I'm a little older
And not afraid to cry
Every day I'm thankful
Just to be alive
When you've been where I've been
Any kind of life
Is paradise
Christmas of '
Was a lonely time for me
Panama was prob'ly fine
But it was nothin' like Tennessee
Never thought the day would come
When I might have to kill a man
I did not sleep a wink that night
But we won for Uncle Sam
Chorus
If you've been where I've been
Any kind of life
Is paradise
It's paradise
Paradise <start> The Hurtin' All Over

A year ago today I felt like dyin'
As unloved and unwanted as a heart could be
But time has away  of changing yesterday
Now the hurtin's all over  all over me Yes
CHORUS
The hurtin's all over  all over my body
It started in my heart and it spread all over me
Father time did his part took the hurt out of my heart
Now the hurtin's all over all over me.
How my arms ache to hold you like they used to do
And my eyes ache for the love light they no longer see
How I miss your caress how my lips ache to be kissed
Yes the hurtin's all over  all over me Well
Repeat chorus <start> Oh maria hands it out
She comes from Guatemala
She helps me get around
She helps when I'm in trouble
When the ice cream hit the ground
The federales they were a'coming
She had made arrangements with a vendor
The stupid gringo  he got away
Now if I had a 's
And maracas in my hand
I'd shake them for maria
I'd pressure her old man
To let me take her back to texas
In the white pickup truck
Where she had done a dozen favors
To get me out of dutch
La...
Now we never spank the children
And the house is pretty small
And I never learned the language
Of old guatamal
But there are frijoles when I'm hungry
And I drink tequila when I'm dry
And the coffee is oh so good
And maria hands it out

For there below Him stood a cowboy alone
Stubborn and proud reckless and loud
God knew he'd never make it on his own
So God looked out all over creation
And listened as that cowboy prayed
God took passion and thunder
Patience and wonder then He sent down
The best thing that God ever made
Cowboys and angels leather and lace
Salt of the earth meets heavenly grace
Cowboys and angels tested and tried
It's a long way to heaven
And one hell of a ride
Nothin's changed since the dawn of creation
For you will find them together today
And only heaven above them knows why she loves him
But he must be the reason she don't fly away
Cowboys and angels leather and lace
Salt of the earth meets heavenly grace
Cowboys and angels tested and tried
It's a long way to heaven
And one hell of a ride
It's a long way to heaven
And one hell of a ride <start> Girl you taught me how to hurt real bad
And cry myself to sleep
You showed me how this town can shatter dreams
Another lesson about a naive fool that came to Babylon
And found out that the pie don't taste so sweet
Now it's guitars Cadillacs and hillbilly music
Lonely lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars Cadillacs and hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
There ain't no glamour in this tinseled land of lost and wasted lives
And painful scars are all that's left of me
But thank you girl for teaching me brand new ways to be cruel
And if I can find my mind now I guess I'll just leave
Now it's guitars Cadillacs and hillbilly music
Lonely lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars Cadillacs and hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
It's guitars Cadillacs and hillbilly music
Lonely lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars Cadillacs and hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
Yes Lord it's the only thing that keeps me hanging on <start> Big Jimmy Baker and Marty Gray met at a teenage party
Jimmy took Marty to school the next day both of them were tardy
Sittin' in the parking lot talking over things waitin' for the morning bell to ring
Two little love birds loose on wing Jimmy Baker and Marty
Kids in love now what can you do but listen to the cooing
Pretty little blonde haired Marty Gray does your mama know
What you're doing Bet your mama don't know what you're doing
Big Jimmy Baker's on the football team Marty's wearin' his sweater
Listen to them talking in the locker room man he's a real go getter
Telling Marty bout the facts of life says there'll never be another
Someday she's gonna be his wife he learned that line from his brother
Kids in love now what can you do but listen to the cooing
Pretty little blonde haired Marty Gray does your mama know
What you're doing Bet your mama don't know what you're doing
Down at the drivein Friday night didn't come to see the movie
Parked in back and away from the light Jimmy says isn't this groovy
Under the seat a bottle in a bag made to affect the senses
Poured out a drink for Marty Gray broke down her defense
Kids in love now what can you do but listen to the cooing
Pretty little blonde haired Marty Gray does your mama know
What you're doing Bet your mama don't know what you're doing
Big Jimmy Baker and Marty Gray no longer goin' together
Fire of love burned out they say Marty's feelin' under the weather
Town turns out to have a big day the football hero's goin' away
But Marty's got the price to pay and Jimmy's gonna let her
Kids in love now what can you do but listen to the cooing
Pretty little blonde haired Marty Gray does your mama know
What you're doing Bet your mama don't know what you're doing
Bet your mama don't know what you're doing <start> Soft as the voice of an angel
Breathing a lesson unheard
Hope with a gentle persuasion
Whispers a comforting word.
Wait 'till the darkness is over
Wait 'till the tempest is done
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow
After the darkness is gone.
Whispering hope
Oh how welcome Thy voice
Making my heart
In it's sorrow rejoice.
If in the dusk of the twilight
Dimmed be the region afar
Will not the deepening darkness
Brighten the glittering star.
Then when the night is upon us
Why should the heart sink away
When the dark midnight is over
Watch for the breaking of day.
Whispering hope
Oh how welcome Thy voice
Making my heart
In it's sorrow rejoice <start> I know what you do and it drives me insane
No matter what I do you never will change
You just keep denying this thing that you do
But someday someway I'll have proof that it's true
I know it's been goin' on now for quite a few years
And many is the time that it's nearly driven me to tears
I can't sleep at night but you don't seem to care
I'm growin' old young you've put grey in my hair
I've tried talkin' to ya but you just turned away
You won't even listen to what I've got to say
I've known for a long time now that I had to find me a way
To catch you in action so I schemed night and day
I thought and I thought and I devised me a plan
I knew I had to confront you with the proof in my hand
So I took a recorder and I placed it under your bed
And then I placed the microphone right at your head <start> Won't say I love you babe
Won't say I need you babe
But I'm going to get you babe
And I will not do you wrong
Living's mostly wasting time
And I waste my share of mine
But it never feels too good
So let's not take too long
You're as soft as glass and I'm a gentle man
We got the sky to talk about
And the world to lie upon
Days up and down they come
Like rain on a conga drum
Forget most remember some
But don't turn none away
Everything is not enough
Nothing is too much to bear
Where you been is good and gone
All you keep's the getting there
To live is to fly low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes
It's goodbye to all my friends
It's time to go again
Think of all the poetry
And the pickin' down the line
I'll miss the system here
The bottom's low and the treble's clear
But it don't pay to think too much
On the things you leave behind
I may be gone but I won't be long
I'll be bringing back the melody
And the rhythm that I find
We all got holes to fill
And them holes are all that's real
Some fall on you like a storm
Sometimes you dig your own
But choice is yours to make
Time is yours to take
Some dive into the sea
Some toil upon the stone
To live is to fly low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
The sleep out of your eyes <start> Angel oh my angel Angelina
Heaven must be wonderin' where you are
Mornin' finds me prayin' please let me keep her
Each night finds me wishin' on a star
That always oh always Angelina
You'll be stayin' right here in my arms
Sweetest of the sweet those ruby lips
No other has that touch ooh those fingertips
Bluest of the blue those sparklin' eyes
Like had in glove we fit you know you're just my size
You and all your special ways and means
Oh I love you Angelina
Angel oh my angel Angelina
Heaven must be wonderin' where you are
Mornin' finds me prayin' please let me keep her
Each night finds me wishin' on a star
That always oh always Angelina
You'll be stayin' right here in my arms
You'll be stayin' right here in my arms <start> Sacred mem'ries often take me to the place where I grew up
And that little country church that I love so much
I used to go there every time that old church bell would ring
And I remember how I love the songs we used to sing
Like oh Lord you know I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home oh Lord what will I do
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
They were singing Lord I'm coming on when I got saved
And when I got baptized they sang amzaing grace
And oh how sweet the sound when everybody would join in
And sang my favorite song if we never meet again
Where the charming roses bloom forever and where separation comes no more
If we never meet again this side of heaven I will meet you on that beutiful shore
My mama loved to sing and she sang clear and loud
I can close my eyes and I hear mama now
I recall the song my mama always loved so much
She always sang the loudest sangin' power in the blood
Oh there's power power wonder working power in the blood of the lamb
There is power power wonder working power in the precious blood of lamb
Sacred mem'ries <start> I wasn't born for diggin' deep holes
I'm not made for pavin' long roads
I ain't cut out to climb high line poles
But I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer
I'm not the type to work in a bank
I'm no good at slappin' on paint
Don't have a knack for makin' motors crank no
But I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer
So hand me one more
That's what I'm here for
I'm built for having a ball
I love the nightlife
I love my Bud Light
I like 'em cold and tall
I ain't much for mowin' thick grass
I'm too slow for workin' too fast
I don't do windows so honey don't ask
But I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer
A go getter well maybe I'm not
I'm not known for doin' a lot
But I do my best work when the weather's hot
I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer
So hand me one more
That's what I'm here for
I'm built for having a ball
I love the nightlife
I love my Bud Light
I like 'em cold and tall
I wasn't born for diggin' deep holes
I'm not made for pavin' long roads
I ain't cut out to climb high line poles
But I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer
I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer
O' hand me one more boys
That's what I'm here for <start> Twenty dollars out of mumma's purse bought us a tank of gas
And a pack of tobacco when we were just teenage kids
Me and Jack and Danny we'd go driving around
If there was trouble to be found then we found it quick
Chuckin' doughnuts in the field
'Till old man Smith would call the cops
He'd come running out with a shotgun
'Cause we were running down his crops
And I reckon he's still wondering who that was
But that was us
Now some of those local boys moved on but we never changed a bit
Never had a scrap of sense least that's what some folks said
Then we finally turned old enough to buy our own beer
Don't remember much about that year just lucky that we're not dead
'Cause somebody said they saw some boys
With a ute looked just like mine
Trying to pull down that old water tank
That sits out by the railway line
And people wonder why it leans the way it does
Well that was us
Seems like small towns never change
But things get tough when times get hard
And they said when he got sick
That old man Smith would have lost that farm
'Cause he was getting way behind on all his bills
'Till someone came and brought his crops in from the fields
Yeah and folks 'round here still don't know who that was
That was us
Chuckin' doughnuts in the fields
'Till old man Smith would call the cops
He'd come running out with a shotgun
'Cause we were running down his crops
Somebody said they saw some boys
With a ute looked just like mine
Trying to pull down that old water tank
That sits out by the railway line
That was us
That was us <start> You see I'm always talkin'
When I should be drivin'
But everybody does it these days
You say I'm gettin' cancer
Every time I answer
Yeah whatever you say
Wish I could change my service
Should have never signed up
Heck it never works anyway
The signal's always breakin'
I can't hear nothin'
Hey what did you say
I know you can't hear me
There ain't no use in listenin'
I can't tell what you're sayin'
All I hear is hissin'
Yeah the more that I roam
The more I gotta pay
I'm on my cell phone
What the  did you say
I ought to get a beeper
It be a whole lot cheaper
Just throw this cell phone in the lake
I'd really love to call you
But even when I get through
It's always what did you say
Can anybody hear me
Or am I just wastin' minutes
I'm in 
 was my limit
Hey I gotta go
I can't hear you anyway
I'm on my cell phone
What the  did you say
Oh the more that I roam
The more I gotta pay
I'm on my cell phone
What the  did you say <start> I live only here between your eyes and you
But I live in this world. What do I do
Collect no interest otherwise what I can.
Above all Im not that staring man.
I move like a spirit between this world and that.
The way to move square on my back.
Collect no interest and sell what I can.
Above all Im not that staring man.
You sit in your tower straight and tall
your kingdom around you beginning to fall.
You close your eyes and you hold your tongue.
And every night you check on the damage youve done.
I live only here between your eyes and you.
Caught in your world what would I do
Fear in the air and Ill make my stand.
Prove once again Im not that staring man.
You stand your grand and you take what comes.
And every night you check on your desire to run.
You stand your grand and you take what comes.
And every night you check on your desire to run.
I live only here between your eyes and you.
But I live in this world. What do I do <start> He knows I'm true
But what he don't know is I'm true to only you
Tell me where does it stop
Does he know our married life is on the rocks
Now before you say you want me
For the rest of your life
Tell me what are we gonna do about your husband
And what're we gonna do about your wife
Speak to your side
In the darkness where unfaithfulness must hide
Knowing I'll forever taste
All the tears I'll put upon my children's face
Now before I say I want you
For the rest of my life
What're we gonna do about my husband
And what're we gonna do about my wife
Shouldn't we stop and look around
Let's think about the hearts we'll be breaking
And though we want each other
Need each other and we love each other
Think about the move we are making
Oh baby don't you cry
No matter what we'll never ever say goodbye
And Bobby I promise you this
Though I wear his ring I'll always wear your kiss
But as for marriage we can't pay the price
'Cause you don't really want to hurt your husband
And you don't really want to hurt your wife
So what're we gonna do about your husband
What're we gonna do about your wife <start> Her right hand closed the front porch door
And suddenly a child no more
All the ribbons all the bows in a box now on her closet floor
Anxious for what's to come
Afraid to leave a place she loves
She's not a woman not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
After 
Broken hearts and rusted dreams
Sometimes make it hard to leave and
Certainty is out of reach even with some self belief
So she bites her lip and shows a smile
Flips her hair and flaunts her style
She's not a woman not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
After 
Her memories she stowed away
Pulls them out on rainy days
And brand new faces take their place beside the ones that never fade
Shes strong and fragile weak and smart
Whatever the cost she plays the part
She's not a woman not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
After 
Her right hand closed the front porch door
And suddenly a child no more. <start> 
Hello you said the day we met
Handing me a yellow rose
You asked me out
And to your surprise
And to mine I said I'd go
I thought it so romantic
And I found you sweet and bold
Though we'd only met
I still said yes
To a single yellow rose
And for years to come
You were the one
To sleep with me at night
To laugh and talk
And share my thoughts
And hold me when I'd cry
And on every occasion
And for no good reason to
A big bouquet or a single yellow rose
Was sent from you
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
I still love you so
I never see a yellow rose
That I didn't think of you
It's still my favorite flower
Though the yellow's turned to blue
The day you left my teardrops fell
Upon your farewell not
You said goodbye like you said hello
With a single yellow rose
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
Oh I still love you so
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Sweet yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
I still love you so <start> What a dying world redefines the reasons we strive to exist
Refrain control and we're bound to learn the meaning of moments like this
'Cause in the peaceful lull the quiet
Seduced by the promise of bliss we soon forget that nothing's happened yet
We're living for moments like this
So hold me whisper gently this is what we live for how we learn who we are
It defines us ever reminding us that life never is more precious than this
From the dim light in the greyness the aim of the soul tends to miss
Then the clouds catch fire and the oceans pitch
We're made for the moments like this
So hold me whisper gently that there's nothing to fear
You'll always be near to remind me to stand behind me
Although life can be rough we can never give up
It's in our power to face the storm with all its fury and madness
The flash of thunder will be harnessed with the longing and sadness
The clouds will grey.
Hold me. Whisper gently this is what we live for how we learn how we are
It defines us ever reminding us that life never is more precious than this
Hold me. Whisper gently that there's nothing to fear
You'll always be near to remind me stand behind me
Although life can be rough we can never give up. <start> It's been five days since I shaved I swear
My hair's gettin' long but I don't care
Lawn chair sitting ain't going nowhere
A big old smile on my face
Pointin' out pictures in a cloudy sky
Craving me a piece of that pecan pie
Might lay in the grass and kill some time
Looking like I'm in a daze
But it ain't no purple haze
Chorus
I ain't stoned on what you think
Just an afternoon sun that's starting to sink
I ain't drunk on nothing you can buy
Just a kiss from a woman and a look in her eye
What I'm on you don't need much
It's a little goes a long way kinda stuff
Yeah I'm breathing yeah I'm feeling alright
I'm high on life
Gettin' buzzed by this bumble bee flying around
My day in the sun is my night on the town
Just me waking up is me getting down
Spinning like a tiltawhirl
Sitting on top of the world
Repeat Chorus
I ain't saying that stuff is bad
But it's so low compared to the highs I have
Counting my blessings kicking back
Sipping on sweet tea in a glass
And watching my baby laugh
Don't get much better than that
Repeat Chorus
I'm finally believing what I'm seeing
That's why
I'm high on life
Oh high on life <start> In the black dust towns of East Tennessee
All the works about the same
Well you may not go to a job in the ground
But you'll learn the Miner's Refrain
Chorus
I'm down in a hole I'm down in a hole
Down in a deep dark hole
I'm down in a hole I'm down in a hole
Down in a deep dark hole
Well you searched the rain for the silver cloud
And you wait on days of gold
When you pitch to the bottom and the dirt comes down
You cry so cold so cold
Chorus
Now there's something good in a worried song
For the trouble in your soul
Cause a worried man's been a long way down
Down in a deep dark hole
Chorus
I'm down in a deep dark hole <start> I'm walkin' in love land holdin' your hand
Here in the warm sand walkin' with you
Walkin' in love land feelin' so grand
Walkin' in love land baby with you
I'm happy as I can be while you're here with me
Here in the moonlight watching the tide roll in
I feel your warm touch love you so much
Walkin' in love land baby with you
I've been walkin' in love land you know it makes me feel so fine
I've been walkin' in love land ever since you've been mine
The stars look so bright cause you're mine tonight
Walkin' in love land here with you
Walkin' in love land feelin' so grand
Walkin' in love land baby with you
Baby with you in love land with you
A walkin' with you baby with you <start> Soft clouds all drift away
Bright sunshine never stays
Warm afternoons turn rainy
Dark and cruel
A candle's glowing light will die
The purest voices often lie
And with love I've found
That all the same is true
Even though I should know better
I guess we could maybe try
There is the risk
Of looking like a fool
But I've got a lucky feeling
Just a hunch don't ask me why
You might be an exception
To the rule
Sweet dreams can't be recalled
High hopes collapse and fall
As the sky keeps turning
Sadder shades of blue
The strongest promise finally breaks
And only leads to bigger aches
Are lessons that I learned
At sorrow's school
Even though I should know better
I guess we could maybe try
There is the risk
Of looking like a fool
But I've got a lucky feeling
Just a hunch don't ask me why
You might be an exception
To the rule
Even though I should know better
I guess we could maybe try
There is the risk
Of looking like a fool
But I've got a lucky feeling
Just a hunch don't ask me why
You might be an exception
To the rule
Soft clouds all drift away
And bright sunshine never stays
But you might be an exception
To the rule <start> I don't know what you're doin' but baby I just had to find out
Maybe it's too soon to call you but it's too late now
I've been thinkin' about the way you move
And the way you look when I look at you
And I just can't wait tomorrow's too late
Chorus
Baby just come over we should be a little closer tonight
Let's drink a little something and do a lot of nothin' all night
We can take it slow or we can go wherever you're feelin' like
It really doesn't matter as long as we get closer tonight
You can be here in a song I'll meet you at the end of the street
All we gotta lose is a lonely city night and some sleep
And if you gotta go I'll walk you home
Or if you don't wanna wake up alone
Come on come on don't wait too long
Chorus
Baby just come over we should be a little closer tonight
Let's drink a little something and do a lot of nothin' all night
We can take it slow or we can go wherever you're feelin' like
It really doesn't matter as long as we get closer tonight
Closer tonight
Don't think about it too much
Just get in the car
You're too far away
If you're anywhere but in my arms uh huh
Chorus
Baby just come over we should be a little closer tonight
Let's drink a little something and do a lot of nothin' all night
We can take it slow or we can go wherever you're feelin' like
It really doesn't matter as long as we get closer tonight
Closer tonight oh ohh <start> I wish you only knew all the days I've made it through
Because of you and your sweet love
I wish that I could count the times peace and comfort filled my mind
Because of you and your sweet love
You're what keeps me going the sun that lights my sky
The rose that blooms in winter the rain that cools July
Never try to tell me it wasn't God above that sent me you and your sweet love
 fiddle 
Almost every night it seems you come walking through my dreams
Precious you and your sweet love
And tonight though we're apart there's a fullness in my heart
Thanks to you and your sweet love
You're the rock I cling to the star I wish upon
The water in my desert the anchor in my storm
Never try to tell me it wasn't God above that sent me you and your sweet love
He sent me you and your sweet love <start> It's alright with me
If it's alright with you
It's alright I know
Your love will see me through
When the car won't start
The rain won't stop
And all of the bills are due
It's alright with me
If it's alright with you
Well the boss man rides me all week long
And it's all that I can take
I work each day till' the sun is gone
And no time for a break
But when I get home you rub my back
And tell me I'm your man
With a little love I get back on track
And do it all over again
It's alright with me
If it's alright with you
It's alright I know
Your love will see me through
When the car won't start
The rain won't stop
And all of the bills are due
It's alright with me
If it's alright with you
No matter what life throws at me
I've got the upper hand
'Cause nothin' else can set me free
The way your lovin' can
If I lived in the shack out in the woods
And never see me blue
I just throw another log in the old wood stove
And make sweet love to you <start> Did you say that you've been searching for
A place you've never been
Well here it is
Here it is
And you've been down there on the bottom
And looking out for a friend
Here I am
Here I am
Chorus
We've both grown tired
Of running after rainbows
Here we are
Darling here we are
When it feels like you've been driftin'
And you don't know where you've been
Come on in
You can come on in
And if all you've seen are back doors
That lead you out of town
Turn around
You can turn around
Chorus
We've both grown tired
Of running from each other
Here we are
Darling here we are
Here we are
Here we are <start> She bloomed for me near a little village
In a cabin on the hill
We made our vows to love each other
And I know we always will
She's my rose of old Kentucky
I watch her bloom as the years roll by
And I know there'll never be another
I love her till the day I die
In my dreams I can see you darling
In a gingham dress you look so neat
I long to feel your arms around me
And to kiss your lips so sweet
She's my rose of old Kentucky
I watch her bloom as the years roll by
And I know there'll never be another
Gonna love her till the day I die
Since I left you in old Kentucky
I've missed your love and need you so
But from now on we're gonna be together
From your lovin' arms I'll never go
Yes she's my rose of old Kentucky
I watch her bloom as the years roll by
And I know there'll never be another
Gonna love her till the day I die <start> 
One time when I's growin' up  it was when I's a kid  there was nothin' to do at home so I called up on a friend an' said Let's pack us a box lunch an' go down to the Nishnabotna an' go swimmin'. An' maybe look for some toads.
My friend said he thought that's a good idea 'cause he didn't have nothin' to do either an' he was outta toads.
So we packed up our box lunches an' we started out awalkin' an' we come to a big iron bridge which was five miles from town where we observed a big sign which says West Nishnabotna. I says This here's the place an' an' now if we could just find some toads an' go for a good swim we could have fun all day doin' nothin' just loafin' around in the creek.
We jumped into that dirty water an' I thought we might be able to swim in it but we quickly discovered that we could not even begin to dogpaddle in it. Be because right where we was the Nishnabotna was only fouran'ahalf inches deep. So we wound up acrawlin' along down on all fours in it through the mud an' beer cans an' yucky things an' old pieces a' cars.
We went past a bunch a' fenders an' a couple a' Plymouth hubcaps when we come to a place where we thought there might be some toads. When we was surprised by a farmer who told us to get on out of there an' to never come back or he'd call up the sheriff an' have us put into jail for the rest of our naturalborn lives with nothin' to eat but bread an' water so we'd starve.
But time passes by real quickly when you're havin' fun so we ran through the fenders and the mud to the bridge again. But when we got back there we sadly discovered that the sun had been out and our backs was all blistered so bad we had to lay flat on our bellies for two weeks in bed which made us sick to our stomachs an' we didn't care about nothin' anymore.
It just ain't too good for your livers to go swimmin' in that river. You can get cut up pretty bad in there an' there ain't too many toads.
There's nothin' but There's nothin' but mud in there an' there's all kinds a' crud an' it's layin' all over the place so you'd better watch out.
If you wanna get sick just go crawlin' around in that creek. There's a whole lot a' bad things that can happen to you.
No it ain't No it ain't good for your liver to hunt toads in that river. The West Nishnabotna is the creek of my childhood. <start> I see your van you're a guitar man it's written all over your face
To make it big you quit your gig a playin' bass at the airbase
You've come to town you've been turned down but it's just a question of taste
Don't think you're too good for country music just because you can rock and roll
Likely as not your licks are hot but you won't work much here in Nashville
You're really keen on BB King but they don't cut him here in Nashville
And if you don't pick them country licks you can bet somebody else will
Don't think you're too good for country music just because you can rock and roll

You're really hot on ZZ Tott but you ain't doin' any session
Your licks are neat but you won't eat until you learn one little lesson
You boogie good and I knew you could but they don't boogie much in Nashville
Don't think you're too good for country music just because you can rock and roll <start> Everybody loves somebody everybody needs somebody
And darling this somebody just needs you
A lover needs a lover's lane a flower needs the touch of spring
A new day needs the kiss of morning dew
A snowflake needs the mountain pass a meadow needs the green green grass
And darling this somebody just needs you
Everybody loves somebody...

Everybody loves somebody... <start> Walls we never mean to build them so tall
We lay awake and wish that they'd fall
But they never go away they just tower
There between us till there's nothing left to say
Tears all there is a silents
And tears could this really be what we've feared
Our perfect love is gone
Just when we thought there was nothing that could write all our wrong
We talked all night long
And we emptied out our hearts 'till all the hurt was gone
And we laughed even though we were mad
And we found out all the problems we had just weren't so bad
Yeah and we talked
We said our peace we cleared the air
Tell your mom thanks for the prayers
Were not all the way back
But hey were getting there
All our friends just can't believe
All the change in you and me
They asked us what we did
And we just smiled and said
We talked all night long
And we emptied our hearts 'till all the hurt was gone
Yeah and we laughed even though we were mad
And we found out all the problems we had just weren't so bad
Oh we talked yeah yeah yeah
Oh and it felt so good just talk yeah yeah <start> I can feel the warmth of you against my skin
Like a gentle wave that rushes to the shore
I have loved you since the day the world began
But I don't see how I can love you anymore
When the gentle touch of you is touching me
And the blinding fires of love began to roar
It seems that time stands still for you and me
But I don't see how I can love you anymore
 steel 
I can see that you have meant the world to me
You've been everything that I was searching for
I see the world of love ahead for you and me
But I don't see how I can love you anymore
When the gentle touch of you...
No I don't see how I can love you anymore <start> I've been waiting here for her for my sentence
And I haven't said a word of anger here
And I didn't see her running till it hit me
She's been livin' right behind me all these years
I never found an ending to my suffering
She opened every door I should have closed
With the mercy of a hundred hungry animals
Sorrow she shows dressed in crinolines and bows

I know what I know

I know what I know
Can we fall apart together tonight
I studied every wrinkle on the pillow at my head
And sucked the sunken breath from deep within
She carved it to the body of my memory and said
Let not your sorrows die though I am dead
And I'm living with her now inside the temple
She moves enough to let my patience grow
And then I hear the ringing in the tower
Sorrow she shows dressed in crinolines and bows

I know what I know

I know what I know
Can we fall apart together tonight

I know what I know

I know what I know
Can we fall apart together tonight
Can we fall apart together <start> Do I need to tell you
I don't need to be untrue
Not when I have a lover like you.
Now it don't take that much thought
Not with all the love you've got
And you give it to me free
Some might take that for granted but certainly not me
No not when I have a lover like you
I haven't eyes for anyone else
I'm thinking of you and nobody else
I haven t eyes for anyone else but you
Yooouuu...
She may be all on my case
Want to kiss me on my face
Put my hands on her waist
Take me back to her place
I would happily follow
But not when I have a lover like you. <start> You can't get there from here
I can't live on bread and water
You heard the one about the farmer's daughter
She just needs a little atmosphere
You don't pick your occupation
I didn't ask for this frustration
I need a life and a nice cold beer
But you can't get there from here
If I had time to think about it
I'd build a castle in the yard
For all the things I want so much
Always something I can't touch
But I guess that would be too hard
You can't get there from here
I can't live on bread and water
You heard the one about the farmer's daughter
She just needs a little atmosphere
You don't pick your occupation
I didn't ask for this frustration
I need a life and a nice cold beer
But you can't get there from here
I'm on a road that's going nowhere
Looking for a place that I belong
The wind's pushing me in all directions
But none of them look like home
And you can't get there from here
You can't live on bread and water
You heard the one about the farmer's daughter
She just needs a little atmosphere
Every right track turns out wrong
A different tune but the same old song
I need a life and a nice cold beer
But you can't get there from here
No you can't get there from here <start> It was in the spring one sunny day
My good gal left me Lord she went away
And now she's gone but I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
She called me up from down in El Paso
Said come back daddy Lord I need you so
Ashes to ashes dust to dust
Show me a woman a man can trust
Mississippi River long deep and wide
The woman I'm loving is on the other side
You don't like my peaches don't you shake my tree
Get out of my orchard let my peaches be
Don't you come here running holding out your hand
I'll get me a woman like you got your man <start> You close the door in front of me I wait patiently outside
And as the minutes tick away I feel my anger rise
And who's the object of my rage and who's not being fair
Is it you for your indifference or me for just standing there
'Cause in my mind the room beyond is bathed in golden light
I dream about you through the day and I toss and turn at night
Sometimes it's hard to understand when they say that pride's a sin
Should I go or should I stay on the outside looking in
Well I didn't make the grade today and I'm not the only one
But my heart it won't stop hurting and feeling all alone
Maybe we'll trade places in some not so distant year
I'll hear your voice calling out and I'll cover up my ears
'Cause in my mind the room beyond is bathed in golden light
I dream about you through the day and I toss and turn at night
Sometimes it's hard to understand when they say that pride's a sin
Should I go or should I stay on the outside looking in <start> For you're as sweet as the red rose in June dear I love you adore you I do
Each night through love land we wander sweetheart telling love stories anew
Out of the blue sky a dark cloud came rolling breaking my poor heart in two
Don't leave me alone I love only you you're the one rose that's left in my heart

I wanna hear everybody 
If you're with me everybody everybody sing
Hey y'all
When the girls walk by we'll be like hey y'all
If we get it right they'll be like hey y'all
Wanna rock with us tonight
Wanna roll with us tonight
Hey y'all damn right.
 <start> Every December sky must lose its faith in leaves
And dream of the spring inside the trees
How heavy the empty heart
How light the heart that's full
Sometimes I have to trust what I can't know
Sometimes I have to trust what I can't know
We walk into paradise
The angels lend us shoes
'Cause all that we own
We'll come to lose
And heaven is not so far
Outside this womb of words
With every rose that blooms
My soul is assured
It's just like a song I've known
Yet still unheard
And every leaf of fire lets go
Melting in the arms of earth and snow
And if I could hold you now
You'd enter like a sigh
You'd be the wind that blows
The answer to 'Why'
You'd be the springfilled trees
Of every December sky <start> 
When my strength is not enough to face the disapointments
When nothing seems to work out like I planned
When I think I've reached the end just stop and reassure me
Cause I can make it if you say I can
If you say I can then I can find the strength to do it
In knowing you believe that much in me
Tell me that I can and give me faith in what I'm doing
I'm only just as strong as you make me
But I can do it if you say I can
When I've reached the point of thinking life's not worth the bother
When I can't seem to give what life demands
When it seems impossible to make it any farther
I can go on if you say I can
If you say I can then I can find the strength to do it
In knowing you believe that much in me
Tell me that I can and give me faith in what I'm doing
I'm only just as strong as you make me
But I can do it if you say I can <start> I wish to Lord I'd never been born or died when I was young
I never would've seen your sparkling blue eyes or heard your lying tongue
All the good times are past and gone all the good times are o'er
All the good times are past and gone but brother don't you weep no more
 fiddle 
Now don't you see that lonesome dove flying from pine to pine
He's mourning for his own true love just like I mourn for mine
All the good times...
 dobro 
NBow can't you see that lonesome train going around the bend
It's takin' away my own true love to never return again
All the good times... <start> This world can take you by the hand
And tempt the soul of any man
You can choose your path
There's two roads you can take
One way is right and one is wrong
The flesh is weak
But love is strong
She's all I see between the Devil and me
The gates of Hell swing open wide
Inviting me to step inside
I'll be your friend
Because again I know it's him
The flames are spreading everywhere
Through the smoke I see you there
She's all I see between the Devil and me
I hold her in my arms at night
So safe and warm I close my eyes
And a cool breeze blows 'cross our bodies in the dark
Outside her reach is my concern
Somewhere I know the fire burns
She's all I see between the Devil and me
The gates of Hell swing open wide
Inviting me to step inside
I'll be your friend
Because again I know it's him
The flames are spreading everywhere
Through the smoke I see you there
She's all I see between the Devil and me <start> Sometimes when life's poison arrows shoot me to the ground
Dreams come fallin' down friends just can't be found
I don't worry I don't wonder I know what to do
I don't go crazy I just go for you
Surround me with love I need you beside me
I want you to hold and hide me
When this world is closin' in on me
Surround me with love oh and I can make it
Whatever comes you know I can take it
Just as long as you surround me with love
Who can say what comes tomorrow what the future holds
What lies down the road heaven only knows
But one thing I know for certain one thing that's true
One thing I'm sure of is I need you
Surround me with love I need you beside me
I want you to hold and hide me
When this world is closin' in on me
Surround me with love oh and I can make it
Whatever comes you know I can take it
Just as long as you surround me with love <start> Three minute positive not too country
Uptempo love song
This is a three minute song
To tell her that I love her
And how wonderful we get along
A sweet sentiment that's borderline stick
A lot of right and not much wrong
It's a little bit edgy but softer than spaghetti
Weak yet redundantly strong
It's a three minute positive
Not too country uptempo love song
Chorus
Yeah it's a three minute positive
Not too country uptempo love song
It's a way for me to tell her that I love her
But it can't be too long
There will be no drinkin' no cheatin'
No lyin' no leavin'that stuff it just don't belong
In a three minute positive
Not too country uptempo love song
You won't hear fourletter words
Just me tellin' her
That she's the every breath I draw
And how I can't live without her
And I could never doubt her
'Cause she could never do no wrong
Well it's the right amount of timin' the proper form of rhymin' a little guitar
Then it's gone
It's a three minute positive
Not too country uptempo love song
Chorus
Yeah in a three minute positive
Not too country uptempo love song
There will be no drinkin' no cheatin'
No lyin' no leavin' that stuff it just don't belong
In a three minute positive
Not too country uptempo love song
Yeah in a three minute positive
Not too country uptempo love song <start> We don't ever stay mad for long
And I guess I've always liked that 'bout us
We usually end up on the floor laughin'
Makin' fun of whatever it was
Passions run high and it might seem like sometimes
We don't get along
Baby that's just the way we do it
Fight a little fight but we get through it
When you're lovin' like this you hold on to it
Baby that's just the way we do it
If we hold back on what we're feelin'
We run the danger of growin' apart
Everybody knows that's how love goes
From good to bad in the beat of a heart
As long as we talkin' nobody's walkin' out
Right or wrong
Baby that's just the way we do it
Fight a little fight but we get through it
When you're lovin' like this you hold on to it
Baby that's just the way we do it
Baby that's just the way we do it
Fight a little fight but we get through it
When you lovin' like this you hold on to it
Baby that's just the way
Baby that's just the way we do it
Baby that's just the way we do it
Fight a little fight but we get through it
When you're lovin' like this you hold on to it
Baby that's just the way we do it
Baby we know what we're fighting for
Ain't nobody walking out that door
Baby that's just the way we do it
Fight a little fight but we get through it
When you're lovin' like this you hold on to it
Baby that's just the way we do it <start> Ain't gonna marry in the fall
Ain't gonna marry in the spring
For you're in love
With a pretty little girl
Who wears a diamond ring
Chorus
You're just a country boy
Money  have you none
But you've got silver
In the stars
Gold in the morning sun
Gold in the morning sun
Never gonna kiss the ruby red lips
Of the prettiest girl in town
Never gonna ask her if she'll marry you
She'd only turn you down
Chorus
Never could afford a storebought ring
With a sparklin' diamond stone
All you could afford is a loving heart
The only one you own
Chorus <start> The summer days are gone
Along with you they disappeared
and left me here
Just like the falling leaves
I watched you turn and drift away
Nothing stays
Don't want to face the fall alone
But it's your nature to move on
Is it cold in California
Like I told you it would be
Do you need someone to warm you
Like I warmed you
Is it cold in California
Like it is in Tennessee
Spent the holidays with a man made out of snow
Ho ho ho
Kept on building fires
But they didn't ease the chill
Nothing will
This has been the hardest time
Winter has the longest nights
Is it cold in California
Like I told you it would be
Do you need someone to warm you
Like I warmed you
Is it cold in California
Like it is in Tennessee <start> I come here every night
I drink till I get tight
I don't wonder why
I brought it on myself
I didn't need your help
It comes as no surprise

There's something about a beer
In this here atmosphere
It's the perfect place
To go when you lose face
To sit and drink and cry

Now there's people all around
They don't see me
Drownin' in my misery
No they never notice me
Like they never see
All these memories

There's something about a beer
In this here atmosphere
It's the perfect place
To go when you lose face
To sit and drink and cry <start> If I see you tomorrow on some street in town
Pardon me if I don't say hello 
I be long to an other it wouldn't look so good
To know someone I'm not supposed to know.
CHORUS
Just walk on by wait on the corner
I love you but we're strangers when we meet
Just walk on by wait on the corner
I love you but we're strangers when we meet.
In a dimly lit corner in a place outside of town
Tonight we'll try to say goodbye again 
But I know it's not over I'll call tomorrow night
I can't let you go so why pretend.
CHORUS <start> After the breakup
I really thought we'd make up.
Give her a little time I'd be on her mind
And suddenly she'd wake up.
But today if you listen
Softly off in the distance
Somewhere across town you can hear the sound
Of wedding bells ringing.
And there's bird seed on the concrete
And she's waving goodbye
And they're driving away
And everybody cheerin' them on as the taillights fade
Yeah she's really gone
I thought someday that would be me
But now she's driving away in that limousine
And I'm holdin' on
Like a tin can on a string.
Somewhere in my mind
I'm the one by her side.
In that backseat talkin' 'bout the beach
And that honeymoon flight
I play the whole thing out
From the kids to the house
To the future that we always dreamed about
But there's bird seed on the concrete
And back here in reality
She's driving away
And everybody cheerin' them on as the taillights fade
Yeah she's really gone
I thought someday that would be me
But now she's driving away in that limousine
And I'm holdin' on
Like a tin can on a string <start> I'm gonna buy me a new pair of shoes
Lace em up tight and walk out on you
I'm going down town before this day is through
And I'm gonna buy me a new pair of shoes
I've been saving nickels and dimes
Waiting for just the right time
And I woke up this morning
With a pocket of change
So I'm gonna buy me a new pair of shoes
Lace em up tight and walk out on you
I'm going down town before this day is through
And I'm gonna buy me a new pair of shoes
We've worn that good feeling out
Tore down everything but the house
And someone's gotta to do
Something about you and me
So I'm gonna buy me a new pair of shoes
Lace em up tight and walk out on you
I'm going down town before this day is through
And I'm gonna buy me a new pair of shoes
And it won't take me long to try this new life on
I'll be as good as we are through
I'm gonna buy me a new pair of shoes
Lace em up tight and walk out on you
I'm going down town before this day is through
And I'm gonna buy me a new pair of shoes
I'm going down town before this day is through
And I'm gonna buy me a new pair of shoes <start> I know the heartaches are coming cause I know you're going away
There's no gladness in your voice when you say darling
There's no love behind your lips when they touch mine
There's no feeling in your arms when they're around me
How much could you say it's goodbye time
I know the heartaches are coming I know the sky will turn gray
I know the the tears will start falling cause I know you're going away
Arms that were friends now are strangers eyes that could see now are blind
Only tomorrows of sorrow from the day that you leave me behind
I know the heartaches are coming <start> I left home when I was seventeen
I just grew tired of falling down
And I'm sure I was told
The allure of the road
Would be all I found
And all the answers that I started with
Turned out questions in the end
So years roll on by
And just like the sky
The road never ends
And the people who love me still ask me
When are you coming back to town
And I answer quite frankly
When they stop building roads
And all God needs is gravity to hold me down <start> I tried to stay on the straight and narrow
But I've walked a crooked path
And I've felt worthy of forgiveness
And deservin' heaven's wrath
Right on the money and off by a mile
Ahead of my time and way out of style
But I'm hangin' tough I ain't had enough
I ain't givin' up on life or love
Well I try to stay away from the bottle
But I've reached out for the glass
I try to pull back on the throttle
But I still run out of gas
I've been an angel but never a saint
Hung with the devil don't nobody faint
Cause I'm hangin' tough I ain't had enough
I ain't givin' up on life or love
Yesterday's history today is a chance
Tomorrow is a mystery so I'm makin' plans <start> I MAY NEVER GET TO HEAVEN

RECORDED BY DON GIBSON WANDA JACKSON AND BY CONWAY TWITTY
I walked with you and talked with you and held your loving hand
We loved awhile I lived awhile and thought that fate had it planned
Then someone stole my angel and I lost what I loved most
I may never get to heaven but I once came mighty close
I may never play a golden harp or spread celestial wings
Or walk a golden staircase while the distant chorus sings
Oh but I once held your sweet love and felt your tender touch
I may never get to heaven but I didn't miss it much
I may never get to heaven but I didn't miss it much <start> If you want a love that never will die a love that will always be by your side
If you want a heart that beats just for you
Well that's the kind that I have in mind if you want my love
If you want a kiss that will never grow cold
If you want two arms to have and to hold
A tender caress when each day is through
Well that's the kind that I have in mind if you want my love
If you want to spend your lifetime with me if you want a love through eternity
If you want a home that's made just for you
Well that's the kind that I have in mind if you want my love <start> He came from Kentucky least ways that's what I've been told
Me and fate had left that state before his corpse got cold
He'd been killed for gold hhen California could be sold
To any fool who had been told bbout the Punkin Center Barn Dance
Mama had the fever and my daddy sold his soul
To someone called the devil that he'd met along life's road
Dad would stop to drink a toast and mom was looking like a ghost
Was gonna beat us to the coast and the Punkin Center Barn Dance
At the Punkin Center Barn Dance that's where everyone would be
Dancing to Virginia's reel and the waltz of Tennessee
When the roll is called up yonder you can hear the angels sing
At the Punkin Center Barn Dance God is gold the grass is green
Yeah I left California just before the Grateful Dead
Told the truth about the gold I'd searched for in my head
Like my Dad I'd roamed the land and Mom could never understand
How Lucifer could bring a man to the Punkin Center Barn Dance
Well times are changin' poets say since mom and dad both passed away
But some things in this life will never change
The poets write of things to come the earth will melt into the sun
And you and I will be the ones at the Punkin Center Barn Dance
At the Punkin Center Barn Dance...
At the Punkin Center Barn Dance... <start> If my heart had windows you'd see a heart full of love just for you
A tear may appear when I hold you near but that's for the sweet things you do
And if my heart had windows you'd see a heart full of love just for you
By your side I will stay till we're old and gray reminiscing young moments we knew
And if my heart had windows you'd see a heart full of love just for you
 steel 
A thief couldn't steal the love that I feel and heaven for me has come true
And if my heart had windows you'd see a heart full of love just for you <start> Well I married me a wife
She gave me trouble all my life
She ran me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow rain and snow
She ran me out in the cold rain and snow
She came a runnin on down the stairs
Combin' back her long yellow hair
And her cheeks were as red as a rose
As a rose as a rose
And her cheeks were as red as a rose
Well I ain't got no use
For your red apple juice
And I'm not gonna be treated this a way
This a way this a way
And I'm not gonna be treated this way
I see you sitting in the shade
Counting every dime I've made
I'm so broke and I'm hungry too
Hungry too hungry too
I'm so broke and I'm hungry too
I'm so broke and I'm hungry too <start> I still miss someone
At my door the leaves are falling
The cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone
I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
'Cause I still miss someone
Oh no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone
I still miss someone
Oh no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone
I still miss someone <start> THAT OLD WOODEN ROCKER
There it stands by the fire with its back to the wall
That old wooden rocker so stately and tall
With naught to disturb it but dusting of broom
And no one to use it in that parlor room
Chorus
As she sat by the fire she would rock rock rock
And she heard but the tick of the old grand clock
Eighty years has she sat in that chair prim and tall
That old wooden rocker that stands by the wall
How well I still remember in days that are gone by
How we stood by that rocker my sister and I
And we listened to the stories that grandma would tell
As she sat in the rocker that we all loved so well
If the chair could but speak oh the tales it would tell
How my poor aged grandpa in his battle fell
Beneath the stars and the stripes he fought bravely and true
He cherished his freedom beneath the red white and blue
Chorus
Now grandma is dead all the stories are done
All the children have followed her yes one by one
They have all gone to meet her in the sweet by and by
And all that is left is my sister and I
Chorus <start> I was a stranger brother right in sin
Didn't even have the love of God within
But now I've found Him and I'm glad to say
I love my Saviour more everyday
God loves His children brother yes I know
He will protect you anywhere you go
Just call the point and He will get you there
God will protect you brother anywhere
Brother take warning while yet you have time
Don't let old Satan lead you on down the line
Just tell old Satan to stay out of your way
God loves His children brother everyday
God loves His children brother yes I know
He will protect you anywhere you go
Just call the point and He will get you there
God will protect you brother anywhere
I'm glad I've found and I'm on my way
I'm going to follow Jesus everyday
Nothing can change me and I'm glad to say
God loves His children brother everyday
God loves His children brother yes I know
He will protect you anywhere you go
Just call the point and He will get you there
God will protect you brother anywhere
God loves His children brother yes I know
He will protect you anywhere you go
Just call the point and He will get you there
God will protect you brother anywhere <start> Eighteen a young girl graduates from school
She's got the future to do the things she wants to do.
Little did she know she would let her heart give in
The plans she made for life would change so she could be with him.
A baby's born but she knows their love is just not right
The pressure's on is it right or wrong for her to change her life
Or should she stay committed and hold her feelings deep inside
Society has got her down and she wants to run wild.
She wants to ride a horse cross country
She wants to feel wind brush against her skin
She needs to find what she's been missing
She wants to ride until she finds herself again
She got the courage up to go out on her own
She took the little child and found them a new home
She's working now but it's so hard down at the factory.
With little pay at the end of the day she can barely make ends meet.
Years went by so quickly though it seemed like time stood still
Standing by her front door she could feel the winter's chill.
She looks to the horizon where she sees the setting sun
She feels the urge inside her and it makes her want to run
She wants to ride a horse cross country
She wants to feel wind brush against her skin
She needs to find what she's been missing
She wants to ride until she finds herself again
Even though she's had a rough life
She wouldn't trade it for the world
The treasures that she owns lie in her little girl.
And when she feels the old desires
That her troubles often bring
She can go to bed at night and find them in her dreams where
She wants to ride a horse cross country
She wants to feel wind brush against her skin
She needs to find what she's been missing
She wants to ride until she finds herself again
Oh oh she wants to ride
Oh she wants to ride she wants to ride
She wants to ride she wants to ride
She wants to ride until she finds herself again. <start> Hey girl you know what you've been missing

The one you crave when no one's around

Never let you go hey hey

Get you falling in love at the end of the night
That good eat that long drink that sugar on your lips
That favorite habit you gotta have it you can't quit
I got your fix
I'll be the high that never lets you down
The one you crave when no one's around
I'll pick you up and never let you go 
Never let you go hey hey <start> I won't go lookin' for you tonight I'd rather stay here at home
Than to see you holdin' her so tight in your arms where I belong
I followed you so many times to the places where you go
I watch you kiss her secretly while the lights're turned down low
I thought that if I see you holdin' another I can find someone too
I get lots of chances but I don't even bother cause I'm too busy missin' you
So I won't go looking for you tonight I'll wait till you come in
And when it's me that's holdin' you I know you're mine again
 steel  dobro 
I thought that if I see you holdin' another... <start> If you've been wonderin' what I'm gonna do
While you are sleepin' am I sleepin' too
Well I just sittin' here lovin' you
Close my eyes an' lovin' you
I'm just sittin' back sittin' here lovin' you
An' I have been wonderin' just what I would do
If I weren't sleepin' had I not found you
Well I'd be outside findin' you
I'd be walkin' on the avenue findin' you
Well I'm just sittin' back sittin' here lovin' you
Now the reason that you never see me runnin' 'round
Fingers on my forehead couldn't calm me down
An' he can't even get me up and on my feet
When I've got to take care of some business on the street
I have been walkin' all my streets alone
But I won't keep walkin' to keep from goin' home
Couldn't quite barely concieve of you
Aw an' I'm just sittin' back sittin' here lovin' you
If you've been wonderin' what I'm gonna do
While you are sleepin' am I sleepin' too
Well I just sittin' here lovin' you
I just close my eyes an' lovin' you
Aw an' I'm just sittin' back sittin' here lovin' you <start> I saw you standing in the middle of the thunder and lightning
I know you're feeling like you just can't win but you're trying
It's hard to keep on keepin' on when you're being pushed around
Don't even know which way is up you just keep spinning down 'round down
Every storm runs runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs runs out of rain
So hold your head up and tell yourself that there's something more
And walk out that door
Go find a new rose don't be afraid of the thorns
'Cause we all have thorns
Just put your feet up to the edge put your face in the wind
And when you fall back down keep on rememberin'
Every storm runs runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs runs out of rain
It's gonna run out of pain
It's gonna run out of sting
It's gonna leave you alone
It's gonna set you free
Set you free
Every storm runs runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs runs out of rain
It's gonna set you free
It's gonna run out of pain
It's gonna set you free <start> Sometimes I want to throw my arms around you
Then I tremble at the thought of giving in
Because I know how much it cost to love you and I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you revives the sorrow that wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow but I'm so afraid of losing you again
 steel 
If heaven were to hear my heart's confession wanting you would be my greatest sin
But I'm glad that you're no longer my possession
Cause I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you revives the sorrow...
Yes I'm so afraid of losing you again <start> You told me late last night you wished I'd leave you but I don't have anyplace to go
I'll do anything I can to make you happy but your love for me is gone as we both know
You told me late last night you wished I'd leave you but I don't have anyplace to go
I can't go running home cause I don't have one
To stay in town would be like dying slow
For every day I'd run into your mem'ry and I don't have anyplace to go
 guitar  steel 
The fault is mine for loving you so deeply no man should ever love one woman so
For there you stand telling me to leave you but I don't have anyplace to go
No I don't have anyplace to go <start> Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us never molested though in the wrong
Farther along we'll know all about it farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine we'll understand it all by and by
When we see Jesus coming in glory when he comes from that home in the sky
Then we shall meet him in all his glory we'll understand it all by and by
Farther along
We'll understand it all by and by <start> I come home every night and she meets me with a great big kiss
And she says I love you and how was your day
She brings me my slippers cooks my dinner and holds my hand
And vows her love for me won't ever fade away
Tell it like it was tell it like it was
Not like it is cause it ain't no more tell it like it was
I told her once I was born with a restless streak in me
But she laughed it off and said honey you're just a man
Go where you have to go do what you have to do
I love you and I'll wait for you and I'll understand
Tell it like it was...
 steel 
I called her up last night from down in Mexico
She said baby it's cold tonight and I'm alone
I'm not gonna hold anybody I'm not gonna kiss anybody
I'm saving me for you till you get home
Tell it like it was tell it like it was...
Yeah tell it like it was tell it like it was... <start> I open my door and heres what occurs.
A pretty little gal with pretty little curls.
Leans to the side leans on my mind.
I dont want to live but I sure dont want to die.
Im stuttering again and tellin' her goodbye.
Oh mmmy Goodbbbye
Will you come again Its hard to say.
I surely hope so.
Will you come again Its hard to say.
I surely hope so.
She walks up to me with something more to say.
Then hello and goodbye I hope that youre okay.
Well Im doing fine Im doing fine.
Will you come again Its hard to say.
I surely hope so.
Will you come again Its hard to say.
I surely hope so.
I wish youd see yourself as beautiful as I see you
Why cant you see yourself as beautiful as I see you
I open my door and this is what I see.
The hope inside a girl just looking back at me.
Ohh my Goodbye
Will you come again Its hard to say.
I surely hope so.
And will you come again Its hard to say.
I surely hope so. <start> With seven billion people in this world
I can't believe your still a single girl
I bet you're thinking you're better off on your own
But the best things in life
Just can't be done alone
It takes two to make love baby
I'm sure of that
I'm one you're one
You do the math
Being single has been kinda fun
But I can see you with me ridin' shotgun
I'll take you baby anywhere you wanna go
And together we can have more fun than we can have alone
It takes two to make love baby
I'm sure of that
I'm one you're one
You do the math
I ain't never been a number's guy but sure enough
I look into your eyes and all adds up
It takes two to make love baby
I'm sure of that
I'm one you're one
You do the math
I'm one you're one
You do the math <start> I have no mother in this world
No mother in my home
The place don't seem the same to me
Since mother she has gone
No mother in this world today
No one to call my hand
No one here to care for me
Till we meet in the Promised Land
I never shall forget the day
My mother said farewell
How I miss her in this world
No one but God can tell
No mother in this world today
No one to call my hand
No one here to care for me
Till we meet in the Promised Land <start> Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey baby
Yeah when I first saw that bikini top on her
She's poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought oh good lord she had them long tanned legs
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
It'd look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
She was sippin' on southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
Fire it up let's go get this thing stuck
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
It'd look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Cause it felt so right her and I man we felt so right
I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell I can't get you out of my head
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
It'd look a hell lot better with you up in it
Come on
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Come on girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aw yea <start> Now I wanna gal not the fickle kind to hold me like a clinging vine
And that's the kind of girl I could adore
With flowin' hair and lovin' eyes a sweeter love that satisfies
That's the kind of love I'm looking for
She will be my little misses we'll live on hugs and kisses
Honey won't we have a lot of fun
Just kiss me morning noon and night with lips that kiss like dynmite
That's the kind of love I'm looking for
 steel 
Now you will be my turtle dove in little house on a hill of love
Honey I will love you more and more
Each day will be a honeymoon and we'll just stay at home and spoon
That's the kind of love I'm looking for
She will be my little misses...
 guitar 
She will be my little misses... <start> In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the wedding rings
There on display
She smiles n' nods her head
As he says Honey that's for you
It's not much but it's the best
That I can do
Golden rings  with one tiny little stone
Waiting there  for someone to take you home
By itself  it's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a little wedding chapel later on that afternoon
An old upright piano plays that old familiar tune
Tears roll down her cheeks
And happy thoughts run through her head
As he whispers low With this ring I thee wed
Golden ring  with one tiny little stone
Shining ring  now at last it's found a home
By itself  it's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
Oooooo
In a small two room apartment
As they fought their final round
He says You won't admit it
But I know you're leavin' town
She says One thing's for certain
I don't love you any more
And throws down the ring
As she walks out the door
Golden ring  with one tiny little stone
Cast aside  like the love that's dead and gone
By itself  it's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the wedding rings
There on display
Golden ring <start> Old man Bear dropped a matchbook
Standard procedure couldn't walk
Ate a marzipan lemon drop
Invalidate the short stop
To left field out of the park
Always been that way
Too late to stop
The hammer dropped on aisle ten
No way man I don't do tens
Pick up the produce make amends
Go back to London stay with friends
High Highs Low Lows
Belly full of hot taco
Do with me as you've done with them
Put a call in to the lawyer man
One day you're in one day you're gone
What follows you
Can't be undone
Hedonistic Fatalistic Bombastic Cataclysmic
Stick it Stick it in your ear
So long mother I'm out of here <start> You've got this confidence yeah it was obvious
The way you walked in here
You look sensational and totally capable
Of buying your own beer
But you shouldn't have to
You shouldn't have to
I hate to think about everything you've done without
Or how it's been before
You've ever walked home alone or sat and waited by the phone
Or opened your own door
You shouldn't have to
You shouldn't have to
Do you ever wonder when your dreams will come true
A girl like you can do anything
But anything you don't wanna do
You shouldn't have to
You shouldn't have to
You ever long for a back rub
All alone in your bathtub
Need your glass of wine topped off
But you have to get out and dry off aw
You shouldn't have to
You shouldn't have to
Do you ever wonder when your dreams will come true
A girl like you can do anything
But anything you don't wanna do
Like wash your own car or bait your own hook
Get all made up wonder how you look
Make your own breakfast make the first move
Feel like you ain't being listened to
Kill your own spiders change a flat tire
Stoke your own fire mow your own grass
Pump your own gas ever feel pain
Wish you had a ring on your hand
Feel like anything less than the bestlookin' thing this town's ever seen
Have a dress you'd love to wear but you gotta wait
'Cause there ain't nobody there to help you zip the thing
You shouldn't have to
You shouldn't have to
You shouldn't have to <start> I am a poor wayfaring stranger
While journeying through this world of woe
And there's no sickness toil nor danger
In that bright land to which I go.
I'm going there to see my Father
I'm going there no more to roam
I'm only gogoing over Jordan
I'm only gogoing over home.
I know dark clouds will gather 'round me
I know my way is rough and steep
And beautiful fields lie just before me
Where God's redeemed there vigils keep.
I'm going there to see my Father
I'm going there no more to roam
I'm only gogoing over Jordan
I'm only gogoing over home.
I'm going there to see my mother
I'm going there no more to roam
I'm only gogoing over Jordan
I'm only gogoing over home.
I want to wear that crown of glory
When I get home to that good land
Well I want to shout salvation's story
In concert with ohh the bloodwashed band
I'm going there to see my Savior
I'm going there no more to roam
I'm only gogoing over Jordan
I'm only gogoing over home. <start> I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me so
Chorus
You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants boats and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Now Santa is a busy man He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
Chorus
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants boats and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town <start> It's a lonely road it's a dead man's path
It's a crazier ride ain't made to last
I've only shed one tear for just one soul
How hard I loved her she may never know
Jesus is crying I can hear him scream
Freedom is a hard luck drug I'm a strung out fiend
The wind blows cold the sun won't shine
I did it again Jesus is crying
There's tears in the grass blood on the hills
The cocaine cowboys riding for their thrills
I'm rollin' hard down the e
Little Rock by morning Kansas City by three
Jesus is crying I can hear him scream
Freedom is a hard luck drug I'm a strung out fiend
The wind blows cold the sun won't shine
I did it again Jesus is crying
Sometimes I wonder with the comin' of blood red dawn
If no one's here to miss me does it matter if I'm gone
When I feel like dyin' it's your face I see
If anyone comes knockin' you can blame it all on me
Jesus is crying I can hear him scream
Freedom is a hard luck drug I'm a strung out fiend
The wind blows cold the sun won't shine
I did it again Jesus is crying <start> Youre loves not burning with that same old glow
Youre tryin to win what you already won
You love her and you want to let her know
Well buddy this is my opinion

Sweep her off her feet with a slow slow dance
Hold her like shes holding on to new romance
If you want a love what you can be sure
Take her out and treat her like shes not yours
She wants to feel like its the first time
You gotta shower her with chivalry
Shes full of fantasy from nursery rhymes
I know what I would do if it were me
Repeat Chorus
Soon youll be the lover in her life
Lyin in her arms dancing in her eyes
Repeat Chorus x <start> Last night my dear  the rain was fallin'
I went to bed so sad and blue
Then I had a dream of you
I dreamed I was strolling in the evening
Underneath the harvest moon
I was thinking about you
Then we met out in the moonlight
The stars were shining in your eyes
But another was there to
I don't believe you've met my baby
You looked at her you looked at me
I wondered who you were talkin' to
I shook the hand of your stranger
But I was shaking all inside
I was still wondering who
Your arm was resting on her shoulder
You smiled at her she smiled at you
Her eyes were filled with victory
She said my brother wants to marry
And then my heart was filled with glee
I knew that you would marry me <start> How sweet and happy seem those days of which I dream
When memory recalls them now and then
And with that rapture sweet my weary heart would beat
If I could hear my mother pray again
If I could hear my mother pray again if I could hear her tender voice as then
So glad I'd be with who means so much to me if I could hear my mother pray again
She used to pray that I on Jesus would rely and always walk the shining gospel way
So trusting still his love I'll seek that home above
Where I shall meet my mother some glad day
If I could hear <start> Cowboys don't cry and heroes don't die
Good always wins again and again
And love is a sweet dream that always comes true
Oh if life were like the movies I'd never be blue
Chorus
But here in the real world
It's not that easy at all
'Cause when hearts get broken
It's real tears that fall
And darlin' it's sad but true
But the one thing I've learned from you
Is how the boy don't always get the girl
Here in the real world
I gave you my love but that wasn't enough
To hold your heart when times got rough
And tonight on that silver screen
It'll end like it should
Two lovers will make it through
Like I hoped we would
Chorus <start> Same old place
Same old city
What can I do
I'm falling in love
I'm just an old hound dog
Roaming around oh Lord

No need to worry
There ain't no hurry cause I'm
On my way back to Georgia

She arrives in all her splendor
Each night at nine o'clock
Her chariot is the crosstown bus
That stops right down the block
Now the old piano minstrel plays her tune as she walks in
And the Queen of the Silver Dollar's home again
She's the Queen of the Silver Dollar
She rules this smokey kingdom
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is her throne
Now the jesters flock around her tryin' to win her favors
To see which one will take the
Queen of the Silver Dollar home
Now her royal dress is satin
It's shabby and it's torn
The royal jewels are rhinestones
The shoes are scuffed and worn
Of the many roads she's been down
And the places that she's seen
Well they all look at her and say God save the queen
Now the Queen of the Silver Dollar
Is not as haughty as she seems
She was once an ordinary girl with ordinary dreams
But there's a man who found her
And he brought her to this world
He's the one who made a queen of a simple country girl
Yes I'm the Queen of the Silver Dollar
I rule this smokey kingdom
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne
Now the jesters flock around me tryin' to win my favors
To see which one will take the
Queen of the Silver Dollar home
Yes I'm the Queen of the Silver Dollar
I rule this smokey kingdom
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne
Now the jesters flock around me tryin' to win my favors
To see which one will take the
Queen of the Silver Dollar home <start> There goes the girl I used to know there goes the girl that I love so
There goes the arms that used to hold me tight
There goes the reason that I sigh there goes the reason that I cry
There goes the lips I used to kiss goodnight there goes my love
Well you're the first love of my life and you might be my last
I don't want to be just another memory in your past
There goes the girl
I've got a feelin' for you yet that's with my night and day
Just because we're far apart don't make it go away
There goes the girl <start> The conversation seems to stop as soon as we walk in
And everybody calls to you and asks you where you've been
I fade into the background of an old familiar show
As I become a perfect stranger everywhere we go
Everywhere we go you seem to find some new old friend
And it's not long before I'm on the outside looking in
To other eyes I'm just a guy that no one seems to know
And I remain a perfect stranger everywhere we go
 steel 
I step aside for some old friend watch you while you dance
And I can see a million mem'ries in each stolen glance
They're all reminders from a past that I won't ever know
Cause I remain a perfect stranger everywhere we go
Everywhere we go you seem to find some new old friend
And it's not long before I'm on the outside looking in
I know that I could lose you if I let my feelings show
So I'll remain a perfect stranger everywhere we go <start> A lesson too late for the learning made of sand made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turning in your hand in your hand
Are you going away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Well I could've loved you better didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
As I walk alone my thoughts're tumbling round and round round and round
Underneath our feet a subway's rumbling underground underground
Are you going away
You got reasons of plenty for going this I know this I know
The weeds have been steadily growing please don't go please don't go
Are you going away
You know that was the last thing on my mind <start> Duuu Duuu Duuuuuu wa Duu wa
My love for you is deeper than the depths of any ocean
And as faithful as the stars that grace the night
As constant as the sun making its journey through heavens
and we'll always be together you and I.

Chorus
Together you and I can stop the rain and make the sun shine.
Paint a pretty rainbow brushed with love across the sky
Together you and I belong like a songbird and a song
and we'll always be together you and I

Life with you is sweeter than the fragrance of the flowers
And as happy as the laughter of a child
As peaceful as a river and as lasting as forever
you know we'll always be together you and I
Chorus
I always be beside or close behind you.
Wherever you go you'll always know I'll always find you
Chorus
We'll always be together you and I
Forever together forever you and I

Forever together together you and I will always be

Together you and I........ <start> a dually diesel pullin hard with a horse trailer in tow
montana side of sweet grass and i'm headed home
trophy buckles and whiskey bottles and a worn out saddle horn
bareback riders and teamropers huskin taber corn
the roads get better every time i cross north of forty nine
well i tip my hat and it's good to be back across the medicine line
hurtin albertan with nothing more to lose
too much oil money not enough booze
east of the rockies and west of the rest
do my best to do my damnedest and thats just about all I guess
them windy b.c. mountain passes finally flatten out
hairpin turns and pst got my heart up in my throat
its hairy haulin horses up across the great divide
and them wild chilcotin buckaroos they sure know how to ride
the roads get better every time i cross that british columbia line
i tip my hat and it's good to back across the kickin horse line
well saskabush is pretty yup she's pretty flat
and lord knows i'm a prairie boy so Im pretty used to that
but farmers facin off with gophers man it aint the same
as bein home at the saddledome for the oilers at the flames
the roads get better every time i cross that saskatchewan line
i tip my hat and it's good to be back on mountain standard time <start> If I had you back again I'll tell you what I'd do
I'd dance a little jig of joy and turn a flip or two
My blue days would be over my long nights at an end
My heartaches would all vanish if I had you back again
If I had you back again your sweet lips I would kiss
There'd never be a lonely moment only happiness
Hand in hand together we would find the rainbow's end
I'd walk the straight and narrow if I had you back again
If I'd just one life to live I wanna be with you
And find again the feeling of a love that's sweet and true
I'd turn my back on everything my wild life I would end
I'd change my ways tomorrow if I had you back again
I'd walk the straight and narrow if I had you back again <start> There's a million oil rigs pumping that black gold all over the world
Sheiks and cowboy billionaires in limousines loaded with sparkling girls
But money can't buy happiness just listen to the stories they tell
All you need to really succeed in life is one good well
It takes one good well deep and everflowing
It takes one good well to draw from night and day
Pure and fine it's yours and mine and it's always enough
We got one good well overflowing with everlasting love
Don't it seem kinda funny how people with a lot of money only hunger for more
You think they'd learn that money can burn it's love that keeps the wolf from the door
Precious love lies deep inside hearts you can't buy and sell
When the money's low still we know we got one good well
It takes one good well...
Oh we got one good well overflowing with everlasting love <start> Jesus Jesus Jesus sweetest name I know
He was born in an obscure village
The son of a simple peasant woman
He grew up in another small town
And worked with his father in a carpenter shop until He was thirty
And then for three years he was what we might call a traveling preacher
He never wrote a book He never held political office
The places He did go He usually walked
He never did any of the things that one normally associates with greatness
He had no credentials but himself
When He was only thirtythree years old
The tide of public opinion turned against Him
Some of His friends deserted Him One denied Him
One even betrayed Him and turned Him over to His enemies
He went through the mockery of a trial
He was nailed to a cross between two thieves
While He was dying His executioners gambled for His only possession
His robe His purple robe
When He was dead he was taken from the cross
And laid in a borrowed grave
Provided by the compassion of friends
Almost twenty wide centuries have since come and gone
And today this man is the centerpiece of the human race
The leader in the column of mankind problems
I think I am well with in the mark
That all the armies that ever marched
All the navies that ever sailed the seven seas
All the legislative bodies that ever met
All the kings and rulers that have ever reigned
And all put together have not affected the life of man here on this earth
As much as that one solitary life
Jesus Jesus Jesus Sweetest name I know
Sweetest name I know I know <start> Sitting on the sofa just watchin' TV
Flipping through the channels and what do I see
A swimsuit model in the Cozumel sand
And some lucky guy with a towel in his hand
Holding it up as she changes her suit
Getting all the best shots at the photo shoot
Chorus
How do you get that job that's what I want to know
Wherever he went to school that's where I want to go
Holdin' up that towel he's got it all figured out yessireebob
How hard could it be that's the life for me
How do you get that job
There's doctors and lawyers with PhD's
Who spend half their lives trying to get their degrees
There's pro ball players we can all name
Who spend every waking hour trying to master the game
Then there's the guy with no talent by the girl with no clothes
On the beach by the ocean in Cozumel
Chorus
So Jack you gotta tell me
What are you talkin' about
When they're changing
Oh the usual Blaine quantic physics foreign policy
Yea that's great you ever sneek a look over the towel
You want the truth Blaine You can't handle the truth
Chorus <start> Well I wish I had my picture on The Rolling Stone today
I wish that The Enquirer spread a rumor that I was gay
Well I wish I had some buddies some movie stars and such
'Cause I probably wouldn't worry about the two of us as much
And I'd spend all my money on caviar and cocaine
And I would not remember how you broke my heart today
You know I I wish I had a super model so skinny and so wild
And a waitress in Nevada she says she's carrying my child
Well I'd drive down Sunset Boulevard my hair blowin' in the wind
And I'd stop at fancy restaurants and they'd finally let me in
And I'd spend all my money on caviar and cocaine
And I would not remember how you broke my heart today
Yeah I wish I had my picture with the Rolling Stones today
And I wish The Enquirer would spread a rumor that I was gay
I wish I knew a movie star someone like Charlie Sheen
'Cause if he'd hang out with Kato Kaelin well I guess he'd hang out with me
And I'd spend all my money on caviar and Rogaine
And I would not remember how you broke my heart today <start> Well I left my home in a Scotia town
Moved out west where I'd be found
Dreamin' well I'm dreamin'
Well I never thought my life would change
Always thought it'd be the same
But leaving I'm still believing
That childhood dream I'll have someday
Slowly starts to fade away
I'm seeing
So very close I could almost taste
Seems those years have been a waste
Decieving it's been decieving
Time has past but I still feel
The ocean breeze it seems so real
I'm hoping just hoping
Someday soon if it all works out
Nova Scotia is where I'm bound
Believing I'm still believing
I'll hear the waves against the shore
Seagulls cries at the fishing warf
I'm hearing
The mackerel runs and the dory boats
The simple ways I love the most
I'm dreamin' just dreamin'
I see her when I close my eyes
The Scotia land I once despised
Longing just longing
It's been ten years or more it seems
But I've still got my memories
I'm holdin' just holding
Through the years I've wondered why
The grass seemed greener on the other side
But I'm learning
When I set my feet on that Scotia ground
Then I know I've surely found
The meaning the meaning <start> Fighting soldiers from the sky
Fearless men who jump and die
Men who mean just what they say
The brave men of the Green Beret
st Chorus
Silver wings upon their chest
These are men America's best
One hundred men we'll test today
But only three win the Green Beret
Trained to live off nature's land
Trained in combat hand to hand
Men who fight by night and day
Courage deep from the Green Beret
Repeat st Chorus
Delta Force and CIA
Marines and SOCOM clear the way
Covert missions now in play
Special OPS like the Green Beret
Repeat st Chorus
While back at home a young wife waits
Her Green Beret has met his fate
He has died for those oppressed
Leaving her this last request
nd Chorus
Put silver wings on my son's chest
Make him one of America's best
He'll be a man they'll test one day
So have him win the Green Beret
Have him win the Green Beret
Repeat st Chorus <start> You better get up for your mama
You better grab the best of your life
I know you're ready
To get older
Anyhow
Well all you have to do is wander
Over fields of dark time
Where do you find yourself
Feeling lonesome
Do you reckon your body  your mind 
Day on earth by the streets at night
Oh yeah
I saw you passing
There in the street lights
Do you have
A home for the morning
And are you holding
Holding on so tight
You say that's what you have been given
A whole lot of nothing for your time
And have you sunken
Down in your bones
Do you toss and turn and turn at night
And are you holding holding on so tight
Do you toss and turn and turn at night
And are holding holding on so tight <start> I heard the door slam and I couldn't tell
Was it just the wind or was she mad again 
She's gettin' in her car. I hollar Baby is there something wrong
Thought I heard her say something sounding like I'm gone.
But these days gone can mean so many things.
There's gone for good and there's good and gone
And there's gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear.
Well there's gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dod' gone life.
Is it a whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kinda' gone are we talkin' 'bout here
Well it's gettin' dark out she ain't back yet
Ain't called home turned off the phone. 
Ha this might not be good. I woulda' stopped her when she went to leave
But it didn't call 'cause I didn't really think what I'm thinkin' now.
I'm still not sure what gone is all about.
There's gone for good and there's good and gone
And there's gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear.
Well there's gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dod' gone life.
Is it a whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kinda' gone are we talkin' 'bout here
Is it the kinda' gone where she's at her moms
Coolin' down she'll come around
Or the kind that says you had your chance
And she ain't comin' back.
There's gone for good and there's good and gone
And there's gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear.
Well there's gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dod' gone life.
Is it a whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kinda' gone are we talkin' 'bout here
What kinda' gone are we talkin' 'bout
What kinda' gone are we talkin' 'bout here
What kinda' gone. <start> Joy bells joy bells everlasting joy bells I can hear them ringing while the hallelujahs roll
Joy bells joy bells heavenly joy bells keep the joy beels ringin' down in my soul
 dobro  banjo 
One day I fell down on my knees and Jesus heard me pray
He filled me with his spirit and he washed my sins away
And then the bells of glory for me began to toll
Now Jesus keeps the joy bells ringing in my soul
Joy bells joy bells...
 dobro  banjo 
Joy bells joy bells...
It keep the joy beels ringin' down in my soul <start> I should have known that you were trouble when
I heard the words my sister said
she told me that you were spoiled  rotten to the bone
I suppose that I was blind
by lovesick words and happy times
if only I'd listened to my sister I'd have known
that I am worthy of love
and I deserve to be loved
the sad song has resound in you
your shallow heart and pounding too
turns you into driftwood
not caring where you go
but don't assume you're too far gone
to rise above and change your song
passion never leaves but you must keep it on the stove
I am worthy of love
I deserve to be loved
I spent the last week empty
been all attain a craving in my chest
because an angel had left me
and all I ever gave her was my best
I am worthy of love
I deserve to be loved
I'll put the cap back on this pen
And I will close this book again
I'll pick up the pieces and I'll wait till the day
The waters of this world will rise
by noon it will be past my eyes
I'll break off from you and drift away
I am worthy...
I deserve... <start> He has one that locks the office
And there's one that starts the big fine car
That finds its way home.
He has two that fit the frontdoor locks
And one that fits the mailbox
But inside there's just a spider and
He scuttles to the corner with his mysteries
'Cause he's frightened by the jangle of his pocketful of keys.
He has one to fit the cashbox
And one unlocks the liquor bar
And it finds its way down.
He has one that fits the study door
And one unlocks the desk drawer
And he touches all his letters and
He sorts them all according to his memories
To the icy clank and tinkle of his pocketful of keys.
There's a padlock on the garden gate.
There's a padlock on the hunting lodge.
There's a padlock on the hisandher garage.
Amen.
He was a somber man
Not inclined to telling her his mind.
And there's one that locks the pain up
And one that keeps the hot tears in
But they find their way out.
He has one that locks the best gin up
And one that keeps his chip up
And in shaky situations he
Has learned a way by which he even locks his knees
And he holds himself together with his pocketful of keys.
Yes he holds himself together with his keys. <start> 
John Daniel came to town one summer afternoon
Wearin' dirty work clothes so everyone presumed
He was just another logger from the loggin' camp nearby
And he was but there was somethin' different in John Daniel's eyes
John Daniel was a young man not more than twentyfour
And there was an air about him that one could not ignore
And in spite of callused hands  dirty clothes his face was kind
And I wanted so to know what was in John Daniel's mind
John Daniel tell me where did you come from tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel there's somethin' about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel do you hold the answer to a higher plan
I rented him a room he went upstairs like all the rest
It was Saturday and he'd be goin' in to town I guessed
But he left in a robe and sandals with a Bible in his hand
And I thought to myself John Daniel I don't understand
Now I'd planned to meet some friends of mine when I got off at three
In the park we often gather to talk of love and peace
When I got there I found that a crowd had gathered 'round
And there I saw John Daniel a sittin' on the ground
John Daniel tell me where did you come from tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel there's somethin' about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel do you hold the answer to a higher plan
So You want to be free he said Well this is how you can.
As he read from the Bible he held in his hand
We were searchin' for the truth not knowin' where to look
Not knowin' that the answers all were in John Daniel's book
John Daniel told us all how we could be free
John Daniel taught us all a better way for you and me
He came to us in our own way so we'd be sure to see
He had the light and essence of the man from Galilee
John Daniel tell me where did you come from tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel there's something about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel do you hold the answer to a higher plan
John Daniel John Daniel John Daniel
John Daniel do you hold the answer to a higher plan
John Daniel came to town one summer afternoon
Wearin' dirty work clothes so everyone presumed
He was just another logger from the loggin' camp nearby
And he was but there was somethin' different in John Daniel's eyes
Ooh John Daniel tell me where did you come from
Tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel there's something about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel do you hold the answer to a higher plan <start> As I sit here tonite the jukebox's playin
The song about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words they are saying
It brings memories when I was a trusted wife
It was not God who made Honky Tonk Angels
As you said in the words of you're song
Too many times married men think they're still single
And that's why many a poor girl do go wrong
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame
It was not God who made HTA
As you said in the words of you're song
Too many times married men think they're still single
And that's why many a poor girl do go wrong <start> Just like old time you were here last night and gone was my worry and care
When I awoke I knew then that I had dreamed of an old love affair
I was alone in the darkness my dear many dreams ago you left me there
Sunlight told me you were gone and I had dreamed of an old love affair
 guitar 
I've been so lonely since you have gone I loved you with all of my heart
Heaven was mine when you smiled last night and said that we'd take a new start
Life seems so useless and empty today if it's sun or rain I just don't care
Sunlight told me you were gone and I had dreamed of an old love affair <start> Blinded by Stars
My blood does remember the rhythm of a drum
Beat by a boy soldier whose revolution won
Ive carried pretty flowers to fallen heroes graves
 stood in silence honoring the price our fathers paid
This was their flag but this aint their fight
Dirty with oil tattered by spite
This was their flag but this aint their fight
So what do you call justice  what is freedom for
Dont let the towncrier decide if we go to war
'cause this aint about your medla
The choice is of the soul
 hate is never brave while mercys always always sold
Blinded by stars tangled in stripes
This is our flag but this aint our fight
Dirty with oil tattered by spite
This is our flag but this aint our fight
This is my flag but this aint my fight
Now I was born a rebel I question what Im told
No wonder this young skin Im wearin
Feels so old
Dont be blinded by stars tangled in stripes
This is our flag but this aint our fight
Dirty with oil tattered by spite
This is our flag but this aint our fight
This I s my flag but this aint my fight <start> Who gets to leave with the picture from San Francisco
Whoe gets to leave with the one from Italy
The table and chairs should really be yours when you go
And the rug on the stairs can stay right here with me
You say you'll call when you get a number
You turn to go and you don't look back
There's gotta be more to this than that
There's gotta be more
Gotta be more
More than eenie meenie minie moe
Divide the past let it go
Set the boxes in a row
It's down to who gets the car in the driveway
It's down to who gets the dog and the cat
There's gotta be more to this than that
Could this be right
I feel like there's something missing
Shouldn't we fight or make some kind of scene
We put on a smile and act like we're doing business
It's not our style to show how much this means
All our dreams and a few signed papers
In paper bags on the welcome mat
There's gotta be more to this than that
There's gotta be more
There's gotta be more
More than eenie meenie minie moe
Divide the past let it go
Set the boxes in a row
It's down to who gets the car in the driveway
It's down to who gets the dog and the cat
There's gotta be more to this than that
It's down to who gets the car in the driveway
It's down to who gets the dog and the cat
There's gotta be more to this than that <start> Cowboys don't cry and heroes don't die
Good always wins again and again
Love is a sweet dream that always comes true
Oh if life were like the movies I'd never be blue
CHORUS
But here in the real world
It's not that easy at all
'Cause when hearts get broken
It's real tears that fall
And darlin' it's sad but true
But the one thing I've learned from you
Is how the boy don't always get the girl
Here in the real world
I gave you my love but that wasn't enough
To hold your heart when times got rough
And tonight on that silver screen
It'll end like it should
Two lovers will make it through
Like I hoped we would
Repeat
REPEAT CHORUS <start> Don't you hate hearing that clock on the wall chiming saying its time and
Don't you just wish we could stay right here together all day long
You know it wouldn't be a crime if we crawled back into bed got as close as we could get
Tried to figure out where this thing is going
Baby baby don't don't just say you're leaving
Why don't you stay a little bit longer
Got it going on and I just can't believe it
This feeling it just keeps getting stronger
If you gotta go you gotta know I might go crazy
Here without you baby
Reliving every kiss you ain't leaving me like this
It just ain't right and wait until tonight to light another flame
You know it wouldn't be the same as the fire we got burning this morning
Baby baby don't don't just say you're leaving
Why don't you stay a little bit longer
Got it going on and I just can't believe it
This feeling it just keeps getting stronger
No no one else can love me like you do
You know I ain't even close to through
Loving you
Baby baby don't don't just say you're leaving
Why don't you stay a little bit longer
Got it going on and I just can't believe it
This feeling it just keeps getting stronger
Don't baby baby don't
No baby don't
Oooo no no no baby don't
Baby baby don't <start> Caught in the vice of heaven and earth
He turned his life into a cell
Imprisoned by the doubts which hound us all
And those desires which we all know so well
His days he lost to promises his nights he purged of dreams
And he would wake in the hours before sunrise
And dread the coming of the day
Never thought a man could become so desperate
Never thought a life could lose so much hope
To be tearing at the roots around you
As if in manacles or irons or ropes
They say he told his children that all he taught was lost
That love and pride and honesty
Were to be gained at too high a cost
It's been thirty summers that I've spent with him
And I expect thirty more to pass
He has blessed my life in so many ways
That I could never turn my back
But I need just one more reminder
Of the man that he used to be
If he would just look deep into my eyes
And say it's in you my love that I will find the key <start> Dear heart wish you were here to warm this night
My dear heart it seems like a year since you went out of my sight
A single room a table for one it's a lonesome town alright
But soon I'll kiss you hello at our front door
And dear heart I want you to know I'll leave your arms never more
A single room a table for one <start> If anyone could find the joy that true love brings a girl and boy
We could we could you and I
If anyone could ever say that their true love was here to stay
We could we could you and I
When you're in my arms I know you're happy to be there
Just as long as I'm with you I'm happy anywhere
If anyone could pray each night and thank the Lord that all is right
We could we could you and I
When you're in my arms <start> Ei voc que acha que eu sou louco sou safado
Eu tava meio bebo tava meio emocionado
Mas eu sou um anjo anjo
Bobeia pra ver que eu te fao um estrago
S porque eu te puxei pelo brao
Agarrei no seu cabelo e te dei um abrao
E falei baixinho no seu ouvidinho
Vamos l pra casa que eu fao gostosinho
Tava tonto demais nem percebi
As amigas dela to rindo
Ser que  de mim
Ei voc que acha que eu sou louco sou safado
Eu tava meio bebo tava meio emocionado
Mas eu sou um anjo anjo
Bobeia pra ver que eu te fao um estrago <start> It's hard to find the perfect time to say something
You know is gonna change everything
Living with the shame
It ain't nothing like the pain that I saw on her face
Now me and my pile of things
That she threw out the window
Drowning next to me
No seven years of good can't hide the one night I forgot to wear that ring
So let it rain let it pour if she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me let it come down on me
Every word let it hurt even more than I deserve
Let it come down on me let it come down on me let it rain
Best thing I remember was the young familiar taste of someone on my lips
It's to late to turn around
When the shades start coming down
The guilt you feel's the last thing on your mind
So let it rain let it pour if she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me let it come down on me
Every word let it hurt even more than I deserve
Just let it come down on me let it come down on me let it rain
So let it rain let it pour if she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me let it come down on me
Every word let it hurt even more than I deserve just let it come down on me
Let it come down on me let it rain
Ooh let it rain ooh let it rain just let it rain just let it rain ooh let it rain <start> People say she's only in my head
It's gonna take time but I'll forget
They say I need to get on with my life
But they don't realize
Is when your dialing six numbers just to hang up the phone.
Driving cross town just to see if she's home.
Waking a friend in the dead of night just to hear 'em say it's gonna be alright.
When your finding things to do not to fall asleep
'Cause you know she'll be there in your dreams.
That's when she's
More than a memory
Took a match to everything she ever wrote
Watched her words go up in smoke
Tore all the pictures off the wall
But that ain't helping me at all.
'Cause when your talking out loud and nobody's there
You look like hell and you just don't care
Drinking more than you've ever drank
Sinking down lower than you've ever sank
When you find yourself falling down upon your knees
Praying to God begging him please
That's when she's
More than a memory
She's more
She's more
'Cause when your dialing her number just to hang up the phone
Driving cross town just to see if she's home
Waking a friend in the dead of night just to hear 'em say it's gonna be alright
When our finding things to do not to fall asleep
'Cause you know she'll be waiting in your dreams
That's when she's
More than a memory
People say she's only in my head
Its gonna take time but I'll forget <start> He just caught the Jamestown Ferry it's not a hot day in January
Like he said it'd be if he ever left me
A case of gone was all he carried as he got on the Jamestown Ferry
And he said that gone was all he'd ever need
I didn't think that he'd leave me after seein' how much he needs me
But the fact still remains I'm sittin' here all alone
Missin' a lovin' of my baby Lord it's bout to drive me crazy
He was the sweetest piece of heaven I've ever known
He just caught the Jamestown Ferry...
As I walk through his kingdom of honky tonks and bars
I remember how he'd hold me and comfort me with talk
He didn't cuss with every breath he had a soothing Southern Drawl
Made me feel like a lady through it all
He just caught the Jamestown Ferry...
He just caught the Jamestown Ferry... <start> Well my baby's wearin' a permanent smile
A satisfied look I ain't seen for a while
I ain't had no rings fulfilled any dreams
But somethin's come over my baby it seems
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealin' my honey
Lord I love that child love to see her smile
But these circumstances ain't funny
Where lies a danger is he a stranger or a pal
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealing my gal
If I came home early Lord what would I find
Maybe I'd rather just walk around blind
I know baby loves me Lord I understand
I know how emotions can get out of hand
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealin' my honey
Lord I love that child love to see her smile
But these circumstances ain't funny
Where lies a danger is he a stranger or a pal
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealing my gal
Wherever he is well I'm callin' his bluff
I'm gonna start wearin' that good smellin' stuff
And I'll be the lover that I used to be
Whatever she's missin' she'll get it from me
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealin' my honey
Lord I love that child love to see her smile
But these circumstances ain't funny
Where lies a danger is he a stranger or a pal
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealing my gal
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealing my gal <start> Those lives were mine to love and cherish
To guard and guide along life's way
Oh God forbid that one should perish
That one alas should go astray
Back in the years with all together
Around the place we'd romp and play
So lonely now I oft' times wonder
Oh will they come back home some day
I'm lonesome for my precious children
They live so far away
Oh may they hear my calling calling
and come back home some day
I gave my all for my dear children
Their problems still with love I share
I'd brave life's storm defy the tempest
To bring them home from anywhere
I lived my life my love I gave them
to guide them through this world of strife
I hope and pray we'll live together
In that great glad here after life
I'm lonesome for my precious children
They live so far away
Oh may they hear my calling calling
and come back home some day <start> In the shelter of your eyes I have finally learned my song
It took so long to realize I just can't make it all alone
Words're only what they say but this feeling isn't wrong
Now I'm so glad I found the way it's good to be where I belong
And I'm gonna stay right here cause I'm in rhythm with your mind
Tune out the world and rest my head neath the shelter of your eyes
 dobro 
Words're only what they say... <start> The sun burned hot it burned my eyes
Burned so hot I thought I'd died
Thought I'd died and gone to Hell
Lookin' for the water from a deeper well
I went to the river but the river was dry
I fell to my knees and I looked to the sky
I looked to the sky and the spring rain fell
I saw the water from a deeper well
Well lookin' for the water from a deeper well
Well lookin' for the water from a deeper well
I was ready for love I was ready for the money
Ready for the blood and ready for the honey
Ready for the winnin' ready for the bell
Lookin' for the water from a deeper well
I found some love and I found some money
Found that blood would drip from the honey
Found I had a thirst that I could not quell
Lookin' for the water from a deeper well
Well lookin' for the water from a deeper well
Well lookin' for the water from a deeper well
Well I did it for kicks and I did it for faith
I did it for lust and I did it for hate
I did it for need and I did it for love
Addiction stayed on tight like a glove
So I ran with the moon and I ran with the night
And the three of us were a terrible sight
Nipple to the bottle to the gun to the cell
To the bottom of a hole of a deeper well
Well lookin' for the water from a deeper well
Well lookin' for the water from a deeper well
I rocked with the cradle and I rolled with the rage
I shook those walls and I rattled that gage
I took my trouble down a deadend trail
Reachin' out a hand for a holier grail
Hey there mama did you carry that load
Did you tell your baby 'bout the bend in the road
'Bout the rebel yell 'bout the one that fell
Lookin' for the water from a deeper well...
Well lookin' for the water from a deeper well
Well lookin' for the water from a deeper well <start> Pancho don't you like me no more
Pancho to me our friendship means more
Pancho please forget what I said
'Cause Pancho we're headin' towards our end
I remember the first time when you came to town
Speaking in Spanish making the rounds
When you first saw me your face was agrin
And you called me the Cisco Kid
Pancho don't you like me no more
Pancho to me our friendship means more
Pancho please forget what I said
'Cause Pancho we're headin' towards our end
I said someday you'll be happy with me Pancho
I remember the good times when you loved me so
I gave you my hat and wore your sombrero
And all of the times you saved me from death
Oh Pancho you were the best
I had a black horse you had a gray
My horse was fastest but yours did okay
When it came to chasin' rustlers we'd always win
'Cause we were Pancho and the Cisco Kid
Oh Pancho we're headin' towards our end <start> When I rolled into town it was raining
You met the bus but you brought along a friend
You introduced me to him but I guess I looked right through him
I didn't come all the way to Calgary just to see you with another man
It's a long way out here from Nova Scotia and your new love wasn't part of my plan
But I knew from your smile you'd be with him for a while
I didn't come all the way to Calgary just to see you with another man
 banjo  dobro 
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow for home I'll try to forget you if I can
I don't stand a chance if I don't know to dance
I didn't come all the way to Calgary just to see you with another man

I didn't come all the way to Calgary just to see you with another man <start> I guess there's not much I can do or say
Saw my baby with another guy today
Though I love her and I try to tell her so
It's hello blues and down the road I go
Well I've never seen that guy before today
He held my baby in close this way
And the way she snuggled close to him I know
It's hello blues and down the road I go
Well it seemed our thoughts were much alike
Our likes were much the same
We even had our future planned
'Til in the town he came <start> I feel stuck between two places
Crust and the reward of your face
And I'm burning up inside
As I drive and twist the knife
Between us well it should remain ours
Between their blood clots and scars
I won't consider advice
When they carry the deadliest vice
And I feel that I ain't done wrong
Yes it's just when I have no place to go
Nobody can be themselves
If they just act like someone else
And you know that I'd wait an awful long time
But you gave up and shoved me aside
So gouge gouge out my eyes
Cause I know true love is blind
Now we'll envy each other to death
To be able to finish each others sentences
And I lie awake
Cause I gave up prescription drugs
My brain gets tired
As I lay watching too much time
So gouge gouge my eyes
Cause I know true love is blind
And no one can be themselves
If they only act like someone else <start> I'd heard The Burritos out in California
Could fly higher than The Byrds
Roger McQuinn had a  string guitar
It was like nothing I'd ever heard
And The Eagles flew in from the west coast
Like The Byrds they were trying to be free
While in Texas the talk turned to Outlaws
Like Willie and Waylon and me hey
Well they say Texas music's in the make
And we've been making music that is free
Doing one night stands playing with our bands
Willie Waylon and me oh Mad Dog
They say The Beatles were just the beginning
Of everything music could be
Just like The Stones I was rolling alone
Like a ship lost out on the sea
And Joplin would die for the future
And Dylan would write poetry
And in Texas the talk turned to Outlaws
Like Willie and Waylon and me hey
My name is David Allen Coe and I'm from Dallas Texas
They say Texas music's in the make
And we've been making music that is free
Doing one night stands playing with our bands
Willie Waylon and me Big Jim
I'd heard The Burritos out in California
Could fly higher than The Byrds
Roger McQuinn had a  string guitar
It was like nothing I'd ever heard
And The Eagles flew in from the west coast
Like The Byrds they were trying to be free
While in Texas the talk turned to Outlaws
Like Willie and Waylon and me <start> Yesterday morning just before noon
I passed a girl wearing your old perfume
And I stopped and stared
I could almost see you standing there
Don't get me wrong  I'm almost over you
But now and then I like to go walking through
Some of our old times
Even though I realize
I'll have another chance
I'll find another girl
I'll see another day
And I'll build another world
I'll start another life just like you told me to
And I'll find another love
But there will never be another you
Night after night I go back through the years
I sit on this porch as the sun disappears
Like we did back then
I remind myself once again
That I'll have another chance
I'll find another girl
I'll see another day
I'll build another world
I'll start another life
Just like you told me to
And I'll find another love
But there'll never be another you
Well I guess I should thank you for showing me how love should feel
I know what I'm gonna look for 'cause I felt it when you held me
And I'll have another chance
I'll find another girl
I'll see another day
And I'll build another world
I'll start another life just like you told me to
I'll find another love
But there'll never be another you
Another you <start> In the night while you lay sleeping
Dreaming of your amber skies
Was a poor boy broken hearted
Listening to the winds that sigh
My little darling oh how I love you
How I love you none can tell
In your heart you love another
Little darling pal of mine
Many a day with you I've rambled
Happiest hours with you I've spent
For I had your heart forever
But I find it's only lent
There is just three things I wish for
That's my casket shroud and grave
When I'm dead don't weep for me
Just like those lips that you betrayed <start> Many months have come and gone since you called me on the phone
To tell me that we were through
You thought it'd break my heart but I fooled you from the start
Cause I never did trust you
Well you thought you were mighty wise to run around with other guys
And still saying you were mine
While you had one or two I had a dozen more than you so you got the fooling that time
Oh let it rain and let it snow I don't care oh no no no I'll never worry now
You're the one that wasn't fair wasn't in you to play square I'll get along somehow
So you keep going your way I'll keep traveling mine
But at the end you'll need a friend you'll be the one to sit and pine
So let it rain and let it snow I don't care oh no no no I'll get along somehow
 piano  guitar 
Well you thought you were mighty wise to run around with other guys and still saying you were mine
While you had one or two I had a dozen more than you so you got the fooling that time
Oh let it rain and let it snow I don't care oh no no no I'll never worry now
You're the one that wasn't fair wasn't in you to play square I'll get along somehow
So you keep going your way I'll keep traveling mine
But at the end you'll need a friend you'll be the one to sit and pine
So let it rain and let it snow I don't care oh no no no I'll get along somehow <start> Yesterday you smiled and my world stopped its turning
All the love in your eyes was so strong
From my first hello to last night's bitter tears
And darling I have loved you though in my world you don't belong
Do you remember that first night when I told you I'm not free
And the way we tried so hard not to fall
But somehow time and fate had brought our lives together
And darling I have loved you though in my world you don't belong
Do you remember
Yes darling I will love you though in my world you don't belong <start> Father meet me with your arms wide open
The world's done broken your prodigal son
Down the road I traveled
Everything raveled only came undone
Father lead me down to the river
Wash me in the water till I'm whiter than snow
I know I'm not worthy
But tell me there's mercy for the wanderin' soul
I lost my way but now I'm on my knees
If it's not too late won't you tell me please
You gotta place for me
A little grace for me
Father meet me in the cool green valley
In all of your glory when my days are done
Name me as one of your chosen
Heaven's unbroken prodigal son <start> Oh you're the number one heel in the country
You're the top of the list it's plain to see
And I'm the number one fool that still loves you
Yes you'll always be number one with me
I gave you my love with no reservation your every wish with my every command
I built dreams of our future together my broken heart wasn't part of my plan
Oh you're the number one heel
You make such beautiful speeches and the pictures you painted seemed real
Crazy me I had no way of knowing that you'd turn out to be such a heel
Oh you're the number one heel
Yes you'll always be number one with me <start> I always will remember those sultry desert nights
 hearts burning with a passion
Whoa it's never felt so right
It was meant to last forever but when I reached out you were gone
It's taken time to mend this broken heart and forget you done me wrong
Now you're back after all this time
You've reawakened all the feelings that I've tried so hard to hide
But baby
Will you love me like you loved me yesterday
That's all I need to know
Will you love me like you loved yesterday
Or will you just let me go
We could leave the pain behind us take a shot at love again
We could fool ourselves believing that our love would never end
I've been missing you whoa what should I do
Did you really have a change of heart
Or are you playing me for a fool
You don't have to tell me where you've been
But there is one thing I've gotta know before I let you in Baby <start> Someday you'll call my name and I won't answer
Someday you'll reach for me I won't be there
For you've grown tired of all the love I gave you
But someday you'll wish that I still care
All through the years how I have loved you and you know I claimed you for my own
Someday you'll call my name and I won't answer for someday you'll find yourself alone
 steel 
When your hair has turned from gold to silver
And your eyes are dimmed by passing years
You'll remember darling what I told you but there'll be no one to dry your tears
There'll come a time within your life dear when you'll need somebody who will care
Someday you'll call my name and I won't answer
For someday you'll find I won't be there <start> As sit here in this loser's cathedral I hear the sad songs that the jukebox play
Then I dream about where love used to live dear
And all the things that I let slip away
With that one exception I had never cheated
But temptation and the wine they both were strong
Now we're left with the marriage on the rocks dear
Where used to stand the sweet and happy home
I'm still singing the song almost persuaded
And darling you still mean the world to me
And I'm sure that we could always be together
If you'd only have a little faith in me
Now you're back and already it's heaven
And I should thank my lucky stars above
That my woman's good to me and now forever
We'll be livin' in a house full of love <start> I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A mem'ry from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life to try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart
Why can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heart <start> You ask me if I love you
Something I should know by now
Well I don't look at love
As something you play with
When I give my heart I give it all
But it's been a while
Since I've felt these old feelings
You're tearing down walls
That I've built 'round my heart
So I have to ask if you're sure that you're ready
Before I let the rest of me fall
Will you be here when I need a shoulder
And hold to my hand when I need you most
Promise your love always and forever
It's something that's got to be clear
Will you be here
When the nights are long
And the chill gets colder
Will your heart stay strong
And love with no doubt
Will you look at me when I get older
The same way you look at me now
Will you be here when I need a shoulder
And hold to my hand when I need you most
Promise your love always and forever
It's something that's got to be clear
Will you be here
Promise your love always and forever
Will you be here when I need a shoulder
And hold to my hand when I need you most
Promise your love always and forever
It's something that's got to be clear
Will you be here will you be here
It's something that's got to be clear
Will you be here <start> Well why don't you love me like you used to do
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
Why don't you love me like you used to do
Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin' in a long long while
We don't get nearer or further or closer than a country mile
Why don't you spark like you used to do
And say sweet nothings like you used to coo
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do
 guitar  steel 
Well why don't you be just like you used to be
How come you find so many faults with me
Somebody's changed so let me give you a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do
Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin' in a long long while
We don't get nearer or further or closer than a country mile
Why don't you say the things you used to say
What makes you treat me like a piece of clay
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
Why don't you love me like you used to do
So why don't you love me like you used to do <start> I've spent a lifetime lookin' for love
Just when I find it it comes undone
I've tried so hard to make love happen
Like some never endin' pattern
I end up on the sad side of the fun
Hurtin' Comes easy
Hurtin' Comes easy
Hurtin' Comes easy
For me
Well I've seen people that got it made
They've got someone and love looks great
But me I've been to every doctor
I've tried it wild and I tried it proper
And I always end up watchin' love walk away
That's okay
Hurtin' Comes easy
Hurtin' Comes easy
Hurtin' Comes easy
For me
I've gotten used to getting over
And hopefully as I grow older
Love won't be so difficult to see
But now for me
Hurtin' Comes easy
Hurtin' Comes easy
Hurtin' Comes easy
For Me <start> I was waltzin' with my darlin' at the cattleman's ball.
Lost in the music and her charms.
I was glidin' around the dance floor she felt so good in my arms.
When a tall dark stranger walked up and cut in.
He said excuse me sir why don't you go have a seat.
I said well listen' here pardner this may sound kinda crude
But the lady is dancin' with me.
Now I paid for the supper an' I bought the drinks
So I feel that I've got the right
Now I'm sorry ole buddy but you just better back off
Or there's liable to be trouble here tonight.
Now I can see that you're upset 'cause it's always been a tradition
To let a fine young gentleman cut in
But if you don't take your hands off my lady pardner
I'm gonna have to break your chin.
Now I've seen your kind before and I know
Exactly what's on your mind.
Your woman probably left you for someone else
So you thought you'd just take a run at mine.
Yeah you though you'd be leavin' her later on
That's right it's all part of the game.
Why don't you take my advice and on go back to the bar
In one piece the same way you came in.
The stranger took off and I saw him tryin' with someone else.
An' my lady well she scowled at me
An' she said you know I think that was very uncouth
And goes against all the rules of chivalry.
Then she smiled up at me with those beautiful eyes
An' said mister you know I kinda like your style
But do you think we should call up the sitter and check on the kids
I just grinned and said naw let's just dance a while. <start> Written by Jean Ritchie

Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
I hear he's gone to some far country
And that he cares no more for me
I wish I were a swallow flying
I'd fly to a high and lonesome place
I'd join the wild birds in their crying
Thinking of you and your sweet face
Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
But now the stars have turned against me
And he cares no more for me
Oh when the dark is on the mountain
And all the world has gone to sleep
I will go down to the cold dark waters
And there I'll lay me down and weep
Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me <start> I was born in Saginaw Michigan
And I grew up in a house on Saginaw Bay
My daddy was a poor hard working Saginaw fisherman
Too many times he came home with too little pay
I loved a girl in Saginaw Michigan
She was the daughter of a wealthy wealthy man
But he called me That son of a Saginaw fisherman
And not good enough to ever claim his daughter's hand
That's why I'm up here in Alaska looking around for gold
Like a crazy fool I'm a digging in the frozen ground so cold
But with each new day I pray I'll strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw Michigan
I wrote my love in Saginaw Michigan
I said Honey I'm a coming home please wait for me
And you can tell your dad that I'm coming back a richer man
I've hit the biggest strike in Klondyke history
Her dad met the bus in Saginaw Michigan
And he gave me a great big party with champagne
Then he said Son you're wise young ambitious man
Why don't you sell your fatherinlaw your Klondyke claim
Now he's up there in Alaska digging in the cold cold ground
That greedy fool is a looking for the gold I never found
But it serves him right and nobody here is missing him
Least of all the newlyweds of Saginaw Michigan <start> IN CASE YOU EVER CHANGE YOUR MIND
Writer Bill Anderson
RECORDED BY CONNIE SMITH

She came down from the mansion on the mountain
She kissed you and she handed you a line
I begged you not to go I said darling don't forget me
In case you ever change your mind
Yes the grass grows greener on the mountain
And the berries grow redder on the vine
But the candle still glows in the window in the valley
In case you ever change your mind
Just in case you ever change your mind and long to hold the love you left behind
I'll be waiting till the end of time in case you ever change your mind

Are the stars any bigger on the mountain is the sun any brighter when it shines
Would comin' back to me be like steppin' down from heaven
In case you ever change your mind
Just in case you ever change your mind...
Just in case you ever change your mind <start> If heavens where your soul gets fed
The your hell is an empty bed
But it's never hard to keep it full
There ain't too many arms you have to pull
'Cause you think that you're getting love
But they know they're just getting some
And deep inside you know it's true
But you don't date believe it do you
Do you
You just lay it down like a quarter on the railroad track
If it sticks to the wheel you're never gonna get it back
It won't do you no good to change your mind
'Cause it already feel off somewhere down the line
Now all the boys call you when they're looking for a good time
Looking for a good time
These days they call it casual
Well that just means they'll leave when they get full
Yeah they say you're cool 'cause you don't care
But in the morning you always cry if they're not there
And you think if they could only see you now
But I swear they'd do it anyhow
'Cause they'll say anything to play the part
But they don't give a damn about your heart
Your heart
You just lay it down like a quarter on the railroad track
If it sticks to the wheel you're never gonna get it back
It won't do you no good to change your mind
'Cause it already feel off somewhere down the line
Now all the boys call you when they're looking for a good time
Looking for a good time
You say you never tell the boys how bad you need it
But every scream is your prayer
You say I love you and you swear you didn't mean it
'Cause you both agree this would go nowhere
Someday I hope that you get tired
Of waking up with the thieves and liars
Maybe you'll go searching for the truth
The kind that ain't written on a phone booth no no
You just lay it down like a quarter on the railroad track
If it sticks to the wheel you're never gonna get it back
It won't do you no good to change your mind
'Cause it already feel off somewhere down the line
Now all the boys call you when they're looking for a good time
Looking for a good time
Yeah just looking for a good time <start> I gotta get while the gettin's good baby get while the gettin's good
Out of your life into a life where I'll be understood
I need a lots of tender love and your heart's made out of wood
If I'm never gonna find a peace of mind I gotta get while the gettin's good
You told me that love is one big bubble we played the game by your rules and you won
And just today I figured out the trouble I learned to crawl before I learned to run
But I'm gonna get while...
I noticed I've quit singing in the shower I rarely ever laugh and I can tell
I'm willting like the petals on the flowers
And there's nothing left to say now but farewell
And I'm gonna get while... <start> I'm sittin' in a city filled with people cars and smoke
The walls are closin' in on me my heart's about to choke
The world becomes a foggy dream and I no longer see
The dirty concrete canyons where I have come to be
Cause a cowboy rides the mountains and the draws inside my mind
With his Buckskin underneath him and his pockets full of time
And I can hear his spurs a jinglin' the chimes of his slappin' tack
As his horse lopes up a ridge with the moon light on his back
He rides into a bearin' country not meant for him alone
For a lovin' dark haired lady waits for her cowboy to come home
Well his hat was made in Texas and his chaps are bat wing style
His saddles made by Hauser he rides it all the while
It glistens with silver conches tap adores for his feet
He's got a chew of Copenhagen tucked inside his cheek
In fact the only thing that saves me here from goin' plumb insane
Is that cowboy poundin' leather down in the coolies in my brain
And I can hear his spurs a jinglin'... <start> You say you're sorry once again dear
You want me to take you back once more
You say you need a helping hand dear
But that's what you told me once before
Walk softly on this heart of mine love
Don't treat it mean and so unkind
Let it rest in peace and quiet love
Walk softly on this heart of mine
I know you soon will find a new love
I feel your heart is turned to stone
But please let me down real easy
For loneliness moves in as you move on
Walk softly on this heart of mine love
Don't treat it mean and so unkind
Let it rest in peace and quiet love
Walk softly on this heart of mine <start> Well I'm fishin' in the middle of the Mississippi river
And the water's too muddy to drink
Big catfish bitin' on the little pole and my baby's waitin' on the bank
Well you tried to make a livin' on the Mississippi river it's a mighty hard life to live
But I'm gonna build a house for my pretty little baby
And I'm gonna build it on the hill
Well maybe if I'm lucky I'll catch a catfish and I'll sell 'em for a dollar bill
Then I'm gonna buy another board and a pocketful of nails
For my little house on the hill
Well I'm fishin' in the middle
My pappy told me there's sure gonna be a lotta hard times a comin' around
But I'd rather go a fishin' on the Mississippi river than livin' in a cold cold ground
Well I can't make whiskey like all the others oh my baby would set me free
I have to go runnin' down Mississippi river when the law come callin' on me
Well I'm fishin' in the middle
Well I'm fishin' in the middle <start> It was a rainy day in Richmond when I've found out what she had done
She walked right out of my life in her hour of fun
They thought I'd gone to Baltimore and never suspected a thing
They didn't know I was following them right down to their shame
A shower of tears fell from my eyes hurt in every one
I couldn't believe what I had seen and what my woman had done
Oh I never thought my baby could ever give me room for doubt
It was a rainy day in Richmond the day that I found out
I followed close behind them to the love nest they had found
Then the pain came down so hard I stopped and turned around
I'd seen enough to tell me there wasn't any doubt
It was a rainy day in Richmond the day that I found out
Oh rainy day in Richmond the day that I found out <start> Just the other night a hometown football game
My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be
She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again
Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers
She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me
Inn her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days
There wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all
And as she walked away and I looked at my wife
And then and there I thankedd the good Lord
For the gifts in my life
Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers
Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered...
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers <start> Please don't write me letters
I can't read them
Please don't stay forever
Just a season
Say you'll be there waiting 
Say you need me
When you call out my name
I can feel it
Carried on by the sea
Through the night
When you look to the stars
Let them guide you
I'll be there at your journey's end
Meet me in the memory
I can feel you
I can feel your heartbeat 
Mine beats with you
When you call out my name
I can feel it
Carried on by the sea
Through the night
When you look to the stars
Let them guide you
I'll be there at your journey's end
Oh oh
I'll never let you go
Oh oh
We're gonna meet again
At your journey's end
Over the mountain to the sea
You will call to me I know
Over the mountain to the sea
You will run to me my love
When you call out my name
I can feel it
Carried on by the sea
Through the night
When you look to the stars
Let them guide you
I'll be there at your journey's end
Oh oh
I'll never let you go
Oh oh
We're gonna meet again
At your journey's end <start> Well you ask me if I'll forget my baby I guess I will someday
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll get along I guess I will someway
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
Once I had a girl to lean on then she put me on my own
Heaven help me be a man and have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll miss her kisses I guess I will everyday
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll find another I don't know I can't say
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
Once I had a girl to lean on
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way <start> If it hadn't been for CottonEye Joe

Deprived of the love of a father blamed for the loss of his wife
You know Lord I've been in a prison for something that I've never done
It's been one hill after another but I've climbed them all one by one
But this time Lord you gave me a mountain a mountain that I may never climb
It isn't a hill any longer you gave me a mountain this time
My woman got tired of the heartaches tired of the grief and the strife
Tired just working for nothing tired of being my wife
She took my one ray of sunshine she took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living she took my small baby boy
And this time Lord you gave me a mountain
Yes you gave me a mountain this time <start> Since you've gone the moon the sun the stars in the sky know the reason why I cry
Love divine once was mine now you're gone
Since you've gone my heart my lips my tear dimmed eyes
A lonely soul within me cries
I acted smart broke your heart now you're gone
Oh what I'd give for the lifetime I've wasted
The love I have tasted I was wrong now you're gone
Oh what I'd give for the lifetime <start> 
Love's a war we all survive a never ending compromise
We always seem to say we're through just to say tomorrow
Babe I'm still in love with you
Every now and then we fight
So very sure we're both right
Saying things we never mean
Just to take them back tomorrow
And admit how wrong we've been
We're through forever 'til tomorrow
That's all we really seem to say
We can't go on with all this sorrow
We've got to find a better way
Many times we would fight and I would leave you
Then I'd find just how much I really need you and love you
Oh oh candle light a glass of wine
Can bring back vision to the blind
Making love is sweet revenge
And when the battle's over
We're back in love and we both win <start> She got an unsigned letter from her secret someone
And she fell into the mystery
Words were few and specifically vague
Intrinsic intrigue
But it said everything
When it just read come to me
Shes always been that responsible someone
Safe within her simplicity
But all this cloak and dagger is stoking her heart
Stroking her curiosity
Is plain little Jane
Gonna risk everything
Is she gonna strike the match
Thatll surely light the flame
Is she carrying a torch for love in vain
Is she gonna break the locks
Take a look inside the box
Knowing that she could release Pandoras shame
Welcome to the game
Whats in a name
She must be dreamin as she boards a plane
And flies into her fantasy
A first class ticket to the city of Boston
Is all she knows of her destiny
When she touches down
Will her feet hit the ground
Is she gonna strike the match
Thatll surely light the flame
Is she carrying a torch for love in vain
Is the gonna bread the locks
Take a look inside the box
Knowing that she could release Pandoras shame
Welcome to the game
Whats in a name
Is our little plain Jane
Gonna risk everything
Yeah.
Is she gonna strike the match
Thatll surely light the flame
Is she carrying the torch for love in vain
Is the gonna break the locks
Take a look inside the box
Knowin that she could release Pandoras shame
Oh welcome to the game
Whats in a name <start> Ain't no hay left on the ground
Gonna join the sun in sitting down
My last bale and well my tail is dragging
Cotton shirt Cotton mouth
Cold ones waiting at the house
It's time for me to get down off the wagon
Chorus 
Hose me down and dress me up
Fire up that old pickup truck
Out the gate and let them horses run
A jukebox and swinging doors
Soft and pretties on a hardwood floor
A cowboy's work just ain't never done
In the land of the midnight sun
Find a looker have her hold my keys
And tell her later we'll be needing these
Grab a cold one turn it upside down
To that honky tonkin' sound
Chorus 
Hose me down and dress me up
Fire up that old pickup truck
Out the gate and let them horses run
'Cause eight o' clock comes twice a day
And either way you'll find me chasing strays
A cowboy's work just ain't never done
In the land of the midnight sun
Shoot the breeze while shooting pool
Dance 'til you're sweating like a rented mule
Getting loud with all my cowboy friends
The party never ends
Chorus 
Hose me down and dress me up
Fire up that old pickup truck
Out the gate and let them horses run
Looky there who waits for me
Smiling sweetly holding up my keys
A cowboy's work just ain't never done
In the land of the midnight sun
In the land of the midnight sun <start> Music  Lyrics  F. Golde  W. Orange  D. Lambert
Marvin he was a friend of mine
And he could sing a song
His heart in every line
Marvin sang of the joy and pain
He opened up our minds
And I still can hear him say
Aw talk to me so you can see
What's going on
Say you will sing your songs
Forevermore 
Gonna be some sweet sounds
Coming down on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud
Oh I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night
It's gonna be all right
On the nightshift
Oh you found another home
I know you're not alone
On the nightshift
Jackie  hey what'you doing now
It seems like yesterday
When we were working out
Jackie  you set
The world on fire
You came and gifted us
Your love it lifted us
Higher and higher
Keep it up and
We'll be there
At your side
Oh say you will sing
Your songs forevermore 
Gonna be some sweet sounds
Coming down on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud
Oh I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night
It's gonna be all right
On the nightshift
Oh you found another home
I know you're not alone
On the nightshift
Gonna miss your sweet voice
That soulful voice
On the nightshift
We all remember you
Ooh the songs are coming through
At the end of a long day
It's gonna be okay
On the nightshift
You found another home
I know you're not alone
On the nightshift <start> This track is an instrumental and has no lyrics. <start> I have seen the warships on Manila Bay watched the sun a setting on the way
I've sailed the seven seas I've crossed the Great Divide
There's nothing like this land of yours and mine
There's nothing like this land yours and my land
From the New York harbor to the Frisco Bay
Up to Mississippi cross the wide Missoury
There's nothing like this land of yours and mine
I've stood alone in Texas I've seen the Broadway lights
Heard a lonesome freight train in the night
I've watched the tall corn grow heard a voice that whispers low
There's nothing like this land of yours and mine
There's nothing like this land <start> I'm going home 
For my reward 
Away up there 
To see my Lord 
He promised me 
In the by and by 
A precious home 
Up in the sky.
Chorus
I'm gonna live right 
To see my Lord 
And the other friends 
Who've gone before 
It'll be like home 
When we all get there 
With Mother and Dad 
And the angels fair .
The time will come 
Be ready to go 
What the Lord has planned 
We'll never know 
Don't take a chance 
And lose your soul 
Hear the angels play 
On the harps of gold.
Chorus <start> I want to tell you all a story 'bout a harper valley widow wife
Who had a teenage daughter that attended harper valley junior high
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
And she said mama i've got a note here from the harper valley pta
Well the note says mrs. johnson you're wearing your dresses way too high
It's been reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin' wild
Now we don't believe you ought to be a bringin' up your little girl this way
And it was signed by the secretary harper valley pta
Well it happened that the pta was gonna meet that very afternoon
And boy were they surprised as mrs. johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard i can still recall the word she had to say
She said i'd like to address this meeting of the harper valley pta
Now there's bobby taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
And mrs. taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
And mr. baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't widow jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down
Now mr. harper couldn't be here 'cause he's stayed too long in kelly's bar again
And if you smell shirley thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me as a mother you think that i ain't fit
Well this is just a little payton place and you're all harper valley hypocrites <start> I walked in
There said slim
Cleaning up his memory with
some sapphire gin
Mr. Paine grabbed my arm
Pulled me aside
And said kid are you ready for
the wild ride
I looked up
There she stood
I said if you didn't look so great
I'd say you look good
She took her hand
Ran it up my thigh
And said cowboy you ready for
the wild ride
Come on now junior take the wild ride
See can you make it on the wild ride
Don't try no shakin' on the wild ride
'Cause things start breakin' on
the wild ride
Layin' on the highway
I saw my mind
In tiny little pieces thrown from
side to side
My heart was shattered
along with my pride
Guess you can't keep 'em
the wild ride
Come on now junior take the wild ride
See can you make it on the wild ride
Don't try no shakin' on the wild ride
'Cause things start breakin' on
the wild ride
I was crawlin' 'cross the floor
I was trying to leave
When I felt something tuggin'
what was left of my sleeve
I heard a little voice with a
goldplated vibe
Say I bought a ticket on the wild ride
Come on junior take the wild ride
See can we make it on the wild ride
Let's try to shake it on the wild ride
We might just break it on the wild ride
Come on junior take the wild ride
See can we make it on the wild ride
Let's try to shake it on the wild ride
We might just break it on the wild ride
Come on come on
Take me on the wild ride
See can you make me on the wild ride
Come on an' shake me on the wild ride
You might just break me on the wild ride <start> I just kissed the one I love for the last time never has his soft lips felt so sweet
He's gone away and won't be back forever
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep
I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep not because I'm sad but cause I'm weak
I can't stand the thought of life alone without him
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep
Just before he said goodbye he called me darling
And slowly ran his fingers down my cheek
I thought I'd die when he said he still love me
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep
Think I'll go somewhere
I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep <start> I see you roving up by tough look side
You got a six foot Shakespeare stickin' in the sky
You're smiling at me from your side view mirror
We might be closer than we appear
Babe have you got it on
Babe have you got it on
Come on come on come back
Babe have you got it on
Now don't tell me that you're my child
If you're got a copy show me a sign
Are your cute little ears turned down too quiet
I can see your smile's got a little bit wider
Babe have you got it on
Babe have you got it on
Come on come on come back
Babe have you got it on
I can see you heading for the north exchange
And I got to move to a south bound lane
Little lady I sure enough enjoyed your company
Before I go ten ten let me tell you something
Babe have you got it on
Babe have you got it on
Come on come on come back
Babe have you got it on
Babe have you got it on
Babe have you got it on
Come on come on come back
Babe have you got it on
Come on come on come back
Babe have you got it on
Come on come on come back
Babe have you got it on <start> When I'm away from you well I can't stay still
My thoughts won't move from the way I feel
It happens time and time again
And the circle never ends
When I'm away from you
Well it hurts to say
My sense has gone so far away
I'm up all through the night
And I can't tell wrong from right
When I'm away from you I see great big clouds
In the fog and rain all the lonely crowds
They seem to be so blue
Every night I'm missing you
When I'm away from you well the sun don't shine
The mood don't come
The words don't rhyme
When I'm away from you I can't let go
And you know oh you know
It's all the things you do that make life worth while
Like the way you talk and the way you smile
It's all the things you do keep me hanging on
And you know don't you know
When I'm away from you well the wine won't flow
The tides don't turn and the wind don't blow
I'm up all through the night
And I can't tell wrong from right
When I'm away from you well the sun don't shine
The mood don't come
The words don't rhyme
When I'm away from you I can't let go
And you know oh you know
It's all the things you do that make life worth while
Like the way you talk and the way you smile
It's all the things you do keep me hanging on
And you know don't you know
When I'm away from you
Well it hurts to say
My sense has gone so far away
It happens time and time again
And the circle never ends
When I'm away from you well the sun don't shine
The mood don't come
The words don't rhyme
When I'm away from you I can't let go
And you know oh you know
It's all the things you do that make life worth while
Like the way you talk and the way you smile
It's all the things you do keep me hanging on
And you know don't you know
When I'm away from you well the sun don't shine
The mood don't come
The words don't rhyme
When I'm away from you I can't let go
And you know oh you know... <start> There's just a hint of indifference
In her lack of conversation when we talk.
And the subject matters change
There's no mention of our future now at all.
She still kisses me each morning
But it seems more like a habit than before.
I know she still loves me
But I don't think she likes me anymore.
She used to laugh at all my jokes
But lately I can't seem to make her smile.
And the last time we made love it was good
But God it's been a while.
She's always there when I get home
But she's no longer waiting at the door.
I know she still loves me
But I don't think she likes me anymore.
'Cause it's just a little colder every time I hold her.
She's just going through the motions
From what's left of her devotion
And it scares me half to death
Wonderin' what tomorrow holds in store.
I know she still loves me
But I don't think she likes me anymore.
Right now I know she loves me
But I don't think she likes me anymore. <start> She's my Tijuana Lady lips as sweet as cherry wine
She's my Tijuana Lady Tijuana Lady say that you'll be mine
Well I've been to California and I've been to Tennessee
Around the world and back a time or two
Hugged those Yokohama mammas in the land of the rising sun
But they could never hold a light to you
I've sipped one or two mint julips down in sunny New Orleans
Kissed those southern belles that stroll the avenue
Laid on the bench in Waikiki and watched the ocean roll
But none of this could hold a light to you
She's my Tijuana Lady...
Yes I've steamed the mighty oceans and I've sailed the seven seas
From Tijuana down to TimBucToo
Shared a glass of wine in gay Paree and a laugh in Londontown
Tijuana girl I'm coming home to you
She's my Tijuana Lady...
She's my Tijuana Lady Tijuana Lady say that you'll be mine <start> Tiger woman I heard that you were back in town 
Tiger woman I heard that you were back in town 
Just like a tiger woman girl you're still puttin' puttin' around
Tiger woman I wonder why I love you still 
Tiger woman I wonder why I love you still 
Just like a tiger woman I guess you come back home for the kill
Well you tore me up in little bitty pieces you dragged me all over the ground
I was a big man but now I ain't nothin' you sure know how to put a good man down
Tiger woman put your long short claws out of me 
Tiger woman put your long short claws out of me 
Just like a tiger woman what you leave ain't so good to see
 guitar 
Well you tore me up...
Tiger woman well you better just keep movin' on 
Tiger woman I said you better just keep movin' on 
Just like a tiger tamer I'm gonna put you where you belong
 <start> What a friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and griefs to bear
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer
O what peace we often forfeit
O what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer
Have we trials and temptations
Is there trouble anywhere
We should never be discouraged
Take it to the Lord in prayer
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share
Jesus knows our every weakness
Take it to the Lord in prayer <start> We're talking on the phone
A million miles away
You crawl inside the line
You snake into my mind
You always get to me
You're like a glass of sweet red wine
I spill on my white shirt
Color of pleasure and pain
Your picture's in the stain
You always get to me
Chorus

I'm under your thumb
Girl you're under my skin

Right before the beginning of the end
When I'm hanging by a thread
There's a circus in my head
I'm in a lonely state of mind
You always get to me
Your love rescues me
You always get to me
Just in time
Love ain't some masquerade
To wear a plastic face
You strip off my disguise
You see the good inside
You always get to me yeah
Chorus x
Oh

You're my net when I'm falling
The answer when I'm calling

You're the stars in my darkness
My faith when I'm heartless

You break down the walls and set me free

You always get to me
Girl you always get to me

You always get to me
Yeah

Oh whoa whoa whoa <start> I did my best to hold onto
My promise of forever
Well you don't even care
About the I love you I whispered
So I'm takin' it back
Takin' it back
I'm tired of your lies
And I caught your act
You don't get Jill
When you don't give Jack
You broke my heart
Now I'm takin' it back
I held my arms wide open for you
When you needed shelter
Now you've gone and done me wrong
You hit the hand that held you
So I'm takin' it back
Takin' it back
I'm tired of your lies
And I caught your act
You don't get Jill
When you don't give Jack
You broke my heart
Now I'm takin' it back
Love must be
A twoway street
Or I don't want it
I won't stay on it
It ain't the road for me
Someday you'll know what you had
When you come to your senses
But you can't have my love again
Unless you're reminiscing
So I'm takin' it back
Takin' it back
I'm tired of your lies
And I caught your act
You don't get Jill
When you don't give Jack
You broke my heart
Now I'm takin' it back <start> In a pickup truck we bought in 
And paid each month till it belonged to me and you
The cardboard boxes in the back hold everything we own
Things we've saved for sixteen years to start a brand new home
We're holding sixteen years of love in cardboard boxes
Sixteen years of laughter sweat and tears
We've stacked the back with happiness sadness love and cheer
Things we've saved together sixteen years
We sold our little dreamhouse on a small six acre farm
And said goodbye to friends we'll miss and fields of golden corn
In our search for city life where pay is big and jobs are fine
Sixteen years of love and tears following behind
We're holding sixteen years of love... <start> 
The heart is stronger
Than you think
It's like it can go
Through anything
And even when you think
It can't it finds a way
To still push on
Though
Sometimes
You want to run away
Ain't got the patience
For the pain
And if you
Don't believe it
Look into
Your heart
The beat goes on
I'm tellin' you that
Things get better
Through whatever
If you fall
Dust it off
Don't let up
Don't you know
You can go
Be your own miracle
You need to know
If the mind
Keeps thinking
You've had enough
But the heart
Keeps telling you
Don't give up
Who are we to be
Questioning
Wondering what is what
Don't give up
Through it all
Just stand up
It's like
We all have better days
Problems getting all up
In your face
Just because
You go through it
Don't mean it got
To take control no
You ain't gotta find
No hiding place
Because the heart
Can beat the hate
Don't wanna
Let your mind
Keep playin' you
Sayin' you
Can't go on
I'm tellin' you that
Things get better
Through whatever
If you fall

That you're good
If you trust in the good
Everything

Light up the dark
If you follow your heart
And it will get better
Through whatever

You've had enough 
But the heart

Through it all
Just stand up <start> Blow me a kiss from across the room
Say I look nice when I'm not
Touch my hair as you pass my chair
Little things mean a lot
Give me your arm as we cross the street
Call me at six on the dot
A line a day when you're far away
Little things mean a lot
Don't have to buy me diamonds and pearls
Champagne sables and such
I never cared much for diamonds and pearls
But honestly honey they just cost money
Give me your hand when I've lost the way
Give me your shoulder to cry on
Whether the day is bright or gray give me your heart to rely on
Send me the warmth of a secret smile
To show me you haven't forgot
Now and forever  that always and ever
Little things mean a lot
Blow me a kiss from across the room
Say I look nice when I'm not
Touch my hair as you pass my chair
Little things mean a lot
Give me your arm as we cross the street
Call me at six on the dot
A line a day when you're far away
Little things mean a lot
Don't have to buy me diamonds and pearls
Champagne sables and such
I never cared much for diamonds and pearls
But honestly honey they just cost money
Give me your hand when I've lost the way
Give me your shoulder to cry on
Whether the day is bright or gray give me your heart to rely on
Send me the warmth of a secret smile
To show me you haven't forgot
Now and forever  that always and ever
Little things mean a lot <start> Chorus
When I loved you you didn't want me
You turned me away from the door of your heart
When I loved you
You loved me too but you didn't know it darling
'Till another won my heart
Well I got the message you sent by a friend
Telling me that you want to be with me once more
You heard of my wedding and you can't believe it
But my heart is safe now it don't ache no more
Chorus
You say that you need me more than you need life
You've asked me to cheat her and meet you tonight
But how could you want me if I were untrue
When you know if I'd cheat her that I'd cheat you too
Chorus
When I loved you
You loved me too but you didn't know it darling
'Till another won my heart <start> I've been ramblin' out Montana way
Tryin' to live on a cow punchers pay
Been changin' them dams in the new summer hay
Irrigating alfalfa for six bucks a day
I'll tell you my story I'd be on my way
But the savings are slow to come on six bucks a day
Out here in the fields while the water runs down
With the sun high above me and the sky all around
I'm dreamin' my dreams of the Canada line
And the places I'd go if the money was mine
I'll tell you my story...
Come Saturday night well you draw out some pay
Then you go into town just to throw it away
And when the end of the month comes rolling your way
Well you ain't got much left on six bucks a day
I'll tell you my story...
Now if I drew out my time and I paid off my debts
I couldn't get to Great Falls on what I have left
But I've got me no choice when them diesel horns blow
Come a wind from the highway I got to pack up and go
Yeah money or none at all they can't hold me this way
For my blankets are rolled and tied and I'm leavin' today <start> With pen in hand
You sign your name
Today at five
I'll be on that train
And you'll be free
And I'll be alone
So alone
If you think
We can't find the love we once knew
If you think
I can't make everything up to you
Then I'll be gone
And you'll be on your own
You'll be on your own
Can you take good care of Jenny
Can you take her to school everyday
Can you teach her how to play
All the games that little girls play
Hear what I say
Can you teach her how to roll up her hair
Can you make sure each night that she says her prayers
Well if you can do all these things
Then maybe she won't miss me
Maybe she won't miss me
And tonight as you laid in that big lonely bed
And you look at that pillow
Where I laid my head
With your heart on fire
Will you have no desire
To kiss me
Or to hold me <start> Think of your fellow man lend him a helping hand put a little love in your heart
You see it's gettin' late oh please don't hesitate put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place and the world will be a better place
For you for you and me and me you just wait you just wait and see and see
Another day goes by and still the children cry put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know we won't let hatred grow put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
Take a good look around and if you're looking down put a little love in your heart
I hope when you decide on just who'll be your guide put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
Put a little love in your heart each and every day
Put a little love in your heart everybody
Put a little love in your heart go now put a little love in your heart <start> If we go should live hill forever I'll be there beside you while we do
I don't know how long we have to gather I just know I'm never leaving you
No matter where the road will be leading or what kind are things we running to
Just as long as my heart keeps on beating darling I am never leaving you
We won't think about the bridges that we're burning
Hand in hand we'll cross the ones we're coming through
For as long as this world keeps on turning darling I am never leaving you
No darling I am never leaving you <start> Here's my keys I want you to take 'em
I think I'm gonna need you to get back home
Hold on to my hat I don't wanna lose it
I couldn't stand for something else to be gone
I'm sure you know the reason I'm here cryin'
I think you'll understand why
Chorus
Tonight I'm the designated drinker
I just lost the one that wrapped me around her finger
I need to get to where I can't think of her
So tonight I'm the designated drinker
I came here to get you to help me
I need a friend to see me through
I hated to call I knew you wouldn't mind at all
I know you know I'd do the same for you
I'm not the kind that likes to drown my sorrow
I may hate myself tomorrow
Oh but
Chorus <start> When I was a little bitty baby my mommy would rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
When I was a little bitty baby my mommy would rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
Well when of them cotton bolls get rotten you can't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields back home
Yes it was down in Louisiana just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home
When I was a little bitty baby
Yes again in them old cotton fields back home
Well in them old I said cotton fields back home <start> I came home the same as before then I noticed the wide opened door
What happened oh where can she be she's gone she forgot to take me
Empty covers the closets are bare not a sound just my falling tears
Did I hurt her oh if I did I'm sorry she's gone she forgot to take me
Is this the right house that I just walked in
Yep there's our picture right where it's always been
I was happy I thought she was too it's so hard to believe we are through
Is someone by her side where I should be she's gone she forgot to take me
She's gone she forgot to take me <start> Little foot little foot
Where you wanna go
Is your boyfriend in the sticks
Are you on your way home
Little foot little foot
How you gonna feel
Is it really real
Is it really real
Love's no good you know it's true
I say it all the time
Sometimes he's in love with you
But maybe he'll be mine
Just kidding
I wouldn't do it to you
No way no way
Little foot little foot
Where you going out
Oh you're always going out
Yeah you're always going out
Little foot little foot
How you gonna feel
When you drink another beer
Yeah you drink a lot of beer
Love's no good and nothing's free
It's sad I know but true
Sometimes he's in love with me
But maybe he wants you
Just kidding
You wouldn't do it to me
No way no way no way
Little foot little foot
Where you wanna go
Oh your boyfriend
Florida
Little foot little foot
How you gonna feel
Is it really real
Is it really real
Are you really real
Am I really real
Are we really real
Is it really real <start> Sometimes I stick my foot in my mouth and I regret it
I aiming for the truth right now and I'm gonna get it
I see the way you're treating love and I don't get it
'Cause she treats you like gold
And it's worth more then you know
And I won't stand here one more night without you being told
That's she's growing tired of trying to light your fire
You better wake up you better wake up or she'll be gone
'Cause no one stays in love alone
Take a swing at me if you want but she's hurting
If you're trying to run her off well buddy it's working
There's a long line of guys like me
Who want to give her everything that's for certain
'Cause she treats you like gold
And it's worth more then you know
And I won't stand here one more night without you being told
That's she's growing tired of trying to light your fire
You better wake up you better wake up or she'll be gone
'Cause no one stays in love alone
If you're still in love with her it's getting hard to tell
I can see her arms wide open crying out for help
'Cause she treats you like gold
And it's worth more then you know
And I won't stand here one more night without you being told
That's she's growing tired of trying to light your fire
You better wake up you better wake up or she'll be gone
'Cause no one stays in love alone
I I I
No one stays in love alone <start> Prepare o seu corao
Pras coisas que eu vou contar
Eu venho l do serto
Eu venho l do serto
Eu venho l do serto
E posso no lhe agradar
Aprendi a dizer no
Ver a morte sem chorar
A morte o destino tudo
A morte o destino tudo
Estava fora de lugar
Eu vivo pra consertar
Na boiada j fui boi
Mas um dia me montei
No por um motivo meu
Ou de quem comigo houvesse
Que qualquer querer tivesse
Porm por necessidade
Do dono de uma boiada
Cujo vaqueiro morreu
Boiadeiro muito tempo
Lao firme brao forte
Muito gado e muita gente
Pela vida segurei
Seguia como num sonho
E boiadeiro era um rei
Mas o mundo foi rodando
Nas patas do meu cavalo
E nos sonhos que fui sonhando
As vises se clareando
As vises se clareando
At que um dia acordei
Ento no pude seguir
Valente lugar tenente
E dono de gado e gente
Porque gado a gente marca
Tange ferra engorda e mata
Mas com gente  diferente
Se voc no concordar
No posso me desculpar
No canto pra enganar
Vou pegar minha viola
Vou deixar voc de lado
Vou cantar noutro lugar
Na boiada j fui boi
Boiadeiro j fui rei
No por mim nem por ningum
Que junto comigo houvesse
Que quisesse ou que pudesse
Por qualquer coisa de seu
Por qualquer coisa de seu
Querer mais longe que eu
Mas o mundo foi rodando
Nas patas do meu cavalo
E j que um dia montei
Agora sou cavaleiro
Lao firme brao forte
Num reino que no tem rei <start> Train arrive  coaches long
Train arrive  coaches long
Well that long black train
Took my baby back home
Train train rolling round the bend
Train train rolling round the bend
Well it took my baby
Away from me again
Went down to the station
To meet my baby at the gate
Ask the station master
If her train is running late
He said no if your wait
On that old 
I hate to tell you son
But that train don't stop her anymore
Train train rolling round the bend
Train train rolling round the bend
Well it took my baby
Away from me again
Heard that whistle blowing
It was the middle of the night
When I got down to the station
The train was rolling out of site
Mystery train rolling round the bend
Mystery train rolling round the bend
Well it took my baby
Away from me again <start> I can's stand to see a good man go to the waste
One who never combs his hair or shaves his face
A man who leans on wine over love that's told a lie
It tears me up to see a grown man cry
I never go around mirrors
I can't stand to see me without you by my side
I never go around mirrors
'Cause I've got a heartache to hide
I never go around mirrors
I can't stand to see me without you by my side
I never go around mirrors
'Cause I've got a heartache to hide
And it tears me up to see a grown man cry <start> There's a place out there for us
More than just a prayer or anything you've ever dreamed of
So when you feel like giving up 'cause you don't fit in down here
Fear is crashing in close your eyes and take my hand yeah
We can be the kings and queens of anything if we believe
It's written in the stars that shine above
A world where you and I belong where faith and love will keep us strong
Exactly who we are is just enough
There's a place for us
There's a place for us
When the water meets the sky
Where your heart is free and hope comes back to life
When these broken hands are whole again
We'll find what we've been waiting for we were made for so much more
We can be the kings and queens of anything if we believe
It's written in the stars that shine above
A world where you and I belong where faith and love will keep us strong
Exactly who we are is just enough
There's a place for us
There's a place for us
So hold on hold on
There's a place for us
We can be the kings and queens of anything if we believe
It's written in the stars that shine above
A world where you and I belong where faith and love will keep us strong
Exactly who we are is just enough
Exactly who we are is just enough
There's a place for us <start> When you finally tell me what I know is on your mind
Don't cry don't let those teardrops start
Just tell me that you're leaving and you'll be gone for good
But speak softly you're talking to my heart
True love is a treasure that few men ever find
I thought that I'd found it from the start
Now it's over it's so over
Only a fool would stay to watch it fall apart
How I tried to change your mind
I sold my soul lost my pride
What's that reflection in your eyes
Is it your plan to love another man
How I tried to change your mind
I sold my soul lost my pride
What's that reflection in your eyes
Is it your plan to love another man <start> I cried a tear you wiped it dry
I was confused you cleared my mind
I sold my soul you bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me
You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I can almost see eternity
You needed me you needed me
And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave why should I leave I'd be a fool
'Cause I've finally found someone who really cares
You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me friend
You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I can almost see eternity
You needed me you needed me
You needed me you needed me
You needed me you needed me <start> On a sleepy endless ocean when the world lay in a dream
There was rhythm in the splash and roll but not a voice to sing
So the moon shone on the breakers and the morning warmed the waves
Till a single cell did jump and hum for joy as though to say
This is my home this is my only home
This is the only sacred ground that i have ever known
And should i stray in th dark night alone
Rock me goddess in the gentle arms of eden
Then the day shone bright and rounder til the one turned into two
And the two into ten thousand things and old things into new
And on some virgin beach head one lonesome critter crawled
And he looked about and shouted out in his most astonished drawl
This is my home ...
Then all the sky was buzzin and the ground was carpet green
And the wary children of the wood went dancin in between
And the people sang rejoicing when the field was glad with grain
This song of celebration from their cities on the plain
This is my home ...
Now there's smoke across the harbor and there's factories on the shore
And the world is ill with greed and will and enterprise of war
But i will lay my burden in the cradle of your grace
And the shining beaches of your love and the sea of your embrace
This is my home ... <start> Who would sell their soul for love
Or waste one tear on compromise
Should be easy enough
To know a heartache in disguise
But the heart rules the mind
And the going gets rough
Pride takes the fall
When you find that kind of love
I can't help feeling like a fool
Since I lost that place inside
Where my heart knew its way
And my soul was ever wise
Once innocence was lost
There was not faith enough
Still my heart held on
When it found that kind of love
Though beauty is rare enough
Still we trust
Somehow we'll find it there
With no guarantee
It seems to me
At least it should be fair
But if it's only tears and pain
Isn't it still worth the cost
Like some sweet saving grace
Or a river we must cross
If we don't understand
What this life is made of
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love
Cause when innocence is lost
There is not faith enough
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love <start> It was down in a grove off Curlew Creek
Mr. Brown went out on her porch to sweep
Was the Sabbath Day late July
The day Mrs. Brown was bound to die
Was rumor goin round about money hid
Not many believed it but Rastus did
All he had in his hand was a Barlow knife
Yeah thats what he used to take the first two lives
They found the Browns tied to their bed
When the Crumbs drove up
The Browns were dead
Old Rastus said hello with a loaded shotgun
Never gave the Crumbs a chance to turn and run
Rastus Russell born of bad blood
Raised on misery murder and mud
Only good thing in this whole song
Is Rastus Russell is a dead and gone
Well Sheriff Ted Tucker saw the mob on the street
Radioed every cop on the beat
Said no warnings given no questions asked
Just find this Rastus and find him fast
The hounds led em down to the old causeway
Found him fishing in Dunedin Bay
Took three strong men to reel him in
And a fourth to finally put the cuffs on him
Rastus Russell born of bad blood
Raised on misery murder and mud
Only good thing in this whole song
Is Rastus Russell is a dead and gone
Nobodyd every broke out of that Clearwater jail
Oh but Rastus did and left a bloody trail
There were red hand prints on a stolen truck
Yeah Rastus was runnin out of luck
Some kind wont stop at anything
He was diggin up his mama for her diamond ring
In the graveyard there they laid him low
And thats a fittin end to this trail of woe
Rastus Russell born of bad blood
Raised on misery murder and mud
Only good thing in this whole song
Is Rastus Russell is a dead and gone <start> I know I've disappeared a time or two
Along the way I lost me and you
I needed a new town for my new start
I'm sellin' VCRs in Arkansas at a Walmart
I haven't had a drink in  days
My eyes are clear and bright without that haze
I like the preacher from the Church of Christ
I'm sorry that I cried when I talked to you last night
I think I'm on a roll
Here in Little Rock
I'm solid as a stone
Wait and see
I got just one small problem
Here in Little Rock
Without you
Baby I'm not me
Without you
Baby I'm not me
I don't know why I held it all inside
You must've thought I never even tried
You know your daddy told me when I left
Jesus would forgive but a daddy don't forget <start> Lord you know you make it easy
And I see how hard you try
Pretending everything is all right
And I can see it in your eyes
Boy I never meant to go wrong
And this is hard for me to say
He wants me to go with him
But if you want me to I'll stay
Don't let me go 'cause it's breakin' my heart
See down see down now once again I'll be playin' my part
Lay down lay down I want you forever lay down
Well I know you saw it comin'
You could see me goin' blind
From the light that shines from your eyes
From the mirror behind mine
Don't let me go 'cause it's breakin' my heart
See down see down now once again I'll be playin' my part
Lay down lay down I want you forever lay down
I'll love you forever lay down
Oh I want you forever lay down
Hon I'll love you forever lay down <start> Inflatable pool full of dad's hot air
I was three years old
Splashin' everywhere
And so began my love affair
With water
On a river bank
With all my friends
A big old rope tied to a limb
And your a big old wuss
If you don't jump in
The water
Yeah when that summer sun starts to beatin' down
And you don't know what to do
Grab your swimming trunks
Ice up that old Igloo
Drive until the map turns blue
Daytona Beach on spring break
Eighteen girls up on stage
White tshirts about to be sprayed
With water
Oh let'er go boys
Yeah when that summer sun starts to beatin' down
And you don't know what to do
Just go and grab someone you wanna see in a bathing suit
And drive until the map turns blue
You can stay right there
When the daylight's gone
Play truth or dare
And it won't take long
'Fore you and her got nothin' on
But water
All you really need this time of year
Is a pair of shades
And ice cold beer
And a place to sit somewhere near
Water <start> Saviour again to Thy dear name we raise with one accord our parting hymn of praise
Once more we bless Thee ere our worship cease
Then lowly bending wait Thy word of peace

Guard Thou the lips from sin the hearts from shame
That in this house have called upon Thy name
 strings 
Grant us Thy peace throughout our earthly life
Our balm in sorrow and our stay in strife
Then when Thy voice shall bid our conflict cease
Call us oh Lord to Thine eternal peace amen <start> Well what do you think about loving baby

Well what do you think about loving baby

I said what do you think about loving baby

In the morning in the evening yeah and a
In the night
Wooh wooh
Well it's alright in the morning

And it's alright in the nighttime
Especially in the night
Baby any time any way

Well loving loving loving
Wooh alright

Wooh alright <start> If all the girls you ever knew were standing here in front of you
I wonder how many there would be
If all the girls you ever kissed were put on paper in a list
I wonder how many there would be
You must've kissed a million for everywhere we go
You seem so well acquainted the way they smile and say hello
If I could count their broken hearts and add my own if we should part
I wonder how many there would be
You must've kissed a million
I wonder just how many there would be <start> Oh my mother was just a girl seventeen
Oh my mother was just a girl seventeen
And my dad was passin' through doing things a man will do
Oh my mother was just a girl seventeen
It's a wonder that I'm in this world at all
It's a wonder that I'm in this world at all
And I have a life to claim though I really don't know my name
It's a wonder that I'm in this world at all
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
But it's written up in the sky and I'll see it by and by
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Well I had a good mother and dad just the same
Well I had a good mother and dad just the same
And they took me to their breast and they surely stood the test
Well I had a good mother and dad just the same
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Just another baby born to a girl lost and lorn
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Now and then there's a lonesome thought in my mind
Now and then there's a lonesome thought in my mind
And on the crowded street I see a strangers face that looks like me
Now and then there's a lonesome thought in my mind
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
But I'll see it by and by cause it's written up in the sky
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name <start> This old houseIt's covered in dust
This old househas seen better days
This old car has turned from red into rust
This old car dreams of the old highway
Well this old river it still twist and turns
This old river used to run untamed
This old town well it's heart still burns
This old town it still runs through my veins.
chorus
It's been a beautiful life
Oh I've been along for one hell of a ride
Even though I may be falling apart whoa it's been a beautiful life
These old shoes they've walked for miles and miles
These old shoes they've walked through life unafraid
This old guitar I got it when I was a child
This old guitar well it still has something to say

All of these eyes have seen laughter and tears
And these eyes have seen something new
This old heart it still has a few more years
This old heart will always love you

Such a beautiful life <start> I'm afraid to go up to the second floor
If you wanted to work it out why'd you lock the door
Thought I was good at loving you
But our light went out when you wanted it to
I wish you the best I'm headed west
It's all I know to do
I will fall I will fall if you come around
Just when I think my heart break's settled down
I will fall I will fall if you come around
When we said goodbye it was forever
And I spent the last year piecing my life together
Just when I think I've let you go
Your songs playing on the radio
Just like that it rushes back
Every part of you
I will fall I will fall if you come around
Just when I think my heart break's settled down
I will fall I will fall if you come around
Oooo oooo oooo
I will fall I will fall if you come around
Just when I think my heart break's settled down
I will fall I will fall if you come around
Just when I think my heart break's settled down
I will fall I will fall if you come around <start> Tell another lie tell another lie cause that's all you know how to do
But some day you'll be crying just like me when someone tells the same lies to you
 guitar 
Saying I'm the first was the first of many lies you've known other loves in the past
It hurts not bein' first but the lies had hurt the worst
Was when you said I'd be the last
Tell another lie tell another lie ...
 guitar 
Telling me you care was the second lie you told saying you'd be true was the third
It took a lot of lies but at last I realized you didn't mean one single word
Tell another lie tell another lie ... <start> Nothing ever turns out like you thought it would
Spare me some patience if you could
Sometimes it feels like you're watching the sun
From a rain cloud far from home
Tomorrow we've always got tomorrow
Somedays it feels like your bags are packed
But there's nowhere to go
And no clock to turn back
When the sun goes down while it's cold outside
And your soul needs something
Just to keep you alive
Tomorrow we've always got tomorrow
Tomorrow we've always got tomorrow
Nothing ever turns out like you thought it would
Spare me some patience if you could <start> We got the ride yeah all gassed up and ready
We got the coolest cooler chilling in the back of my Chevy
We got diamonds in the sky silver moon shining on this road
We got hands in the air wind in our hair a party on the radio
We got the night right where we want it
We got the world wrapped around our fingers girl
It sure feels good don't it
We gotta pour a little jump on in
Don't think twice what we've been waiting all morning
I got you you got me
We got the night right where we want it
Yeah it sure feels good don't it
Baby say left and that's right where I'll be turning
Baby say right alright we'll get this back road burning
And we ain't gonna slow it down
'Til the sun comes creeping up
We got a good time and the headlights
And there ain't no stopping us
We got the night right where we want it
We got the world wrapped around our fingers girl
It sure feels good don't it
We gotta pour a little jump on in
Don't think twice what we've been waiting all morning
I got you you got me
We got the night right where we want it
We got diamonds in the sky
Yeah the time is on our side
And we got the night right where we want it
We got the world wrapped around our fingers girl
It sure feels good don't it
We gotta pour a little jump on in
Don't think twice what we've been waiting all morning
I got you you got me
And we got the night right where we want it
Oh we got the night we got the night girl
Oh right where we want it <start> I was framin' houses in Houston one August afternoon
When the foreman's wife pulled up in her Lincoln and she said I been looking for you
The old man went home early do you wanna take a ride to town
I said I guess it couldn't do no harm and I threw my hammer down
We were shootin' straight tequila when the foreman came stormin' in
He said honey now didn't I warn you what I'd do if I caught you again
She pulled out her little pistol she fired and he hit the ground
She grabbed my arm we jumped into that Lincoln and I put that hammer down
Hammer down hammer down don't look back it's too late now
Ain't nothin' you can do about it anyhow
Just put that hammer put that hammer down
Well I heard the sirens moanin' just east of New Orleans
She cried out to the trooper thank God you rescued me
When they dragged me into the courtroom I knew where I was bound
That old judge threw the book at me then he threw his hammer down
Hammer down hammer down don't look back it's too late now
Ain't nothin' you can do about it anyhow
Just throw that hammer throw that hammer down
On a chain gang out of Houston one August afternoon
I see that same old Lincoln and at the wheel there's a brand new fool
Then the warden taps my shoulder says son quit your foolin' around
In ninetynine years you can lay that hammer down
Oh hammer down hammer down don't look back it's too late now
Ain't nothin' you can do about it anyhow
Throw that hammer throw that hammer down
Just swing that hammer swing that hammer down swing that hammer down <start> There's every kind of definition
But it's something you can't put your finger on
There's a constant exhibition
You explore the propositions then you're gone
It's either money or love that's in your catch
Seldom those two ever match
And then lines will all be blurred before too long
Now there's a slight deception
As you look for all the reasons not to run
And without any exception
Every possible exemption can be done
It's either money or love you're digging for
Seldom love is valued more
But only love can tell you who's the one
There's a lot you can do with money sometimes
It seems like a blessing from above
In the day you might be shopping
But in the nighttime you better make sure it's love
To get your satisfaction
You might take any guarantee that comes along
But without the main attraction
It's merely a distraction then again you're gone
It's either money or love you place your bet
Which is which you'll soon forget
And you tender your regrets and just move on
There's a lot you can do with money sometimes
It seems like a blessing from above
In the day you might be shopping
But in the nighttime you better make sure it's love
Money or love you better make sure
Money or love you better make sure
Money or love you better make sure it's love <start> Hello walls
How'd things go for you today
Don't you miss her since she up and walked away
And I'll bet you dread to spend another lonely night with me
But lonely walls I'll keep you company.
Hello window
Well I see that you're still here
Aren't you lonely since our darlin' disappeared
Well look here is that a teardrop in the corner of your pane
Now don't you try to tell me that it's rain.
She went away and left us all alone the way she planned.
Guess we'll have to learn to get along without her if we can.
Hello ceiling. I'm gonna stare at you a while.
You know I can't sleep so won't you bear with me a while
We must all pull together or else I'll lose my mind.
Cause I've gotta feelin she'll be gone a long long time. <start> You only want to break my heart once more
With promises that you'll keep every vow
You told me that you loved me so so many times before
So how can I be sure you love me now
Sometimes I dream I'm in your arms embrace
And though how happy you once made me there
But every time I trust in you another takes my place
So how can I be sure you really care
You count me in then count me out again
You play with me just like a toy and yet
You make my heart believe in you then leave that same old pain
So how can I be sure you won't forget
I'm only sure I'll never love anew
Your memory is in my heart to stay
And foolish me I'll still be here with open arms for you
For how can I be sure you'll stay away <start> Heartache hurts and you can't move on
Blue skies fade to a gray sky dawn
Trying to find a place in this town
Where you don't feel six feet underground
You're so tired you're so scared
Defeated by the troubles you can't repair
Chorus
When this world comes crashing you don't have to look away
Don't have to give up no don't let the angels play
A sad song to carry you home it wont be long you discover
You recover yeah you recover
Those dark clouds cant hold much rain
After it falls their gonna blow away
Take those sad eyes dry those tears
Baby I'm right here yeah I'm right here
Chorus
When this world comes crashing you don't have to look away
Don't have to give up no don't let the angels play
When this world comes crashing you don't have to look away
Don't have to give up no don't let the angels play
A sad song to carry you home yeah it won't be long you discover
You recover yeah you recover
Yeah you recover yeah you recover <start> Well I spent the better part of my life on a Mississippi riverboat
I used to be known from coast to coast as the slickest gambler afloat
I've dealt the cards from Minnesota to the harbor at New Orleans
Made a lotta big money on the riverboat loved a lotta pretty riverboat queens
Riverboat riverboat I love your whistle's wail
I wish I was back on the riverboart stead of in the Memphis jail
 banjo 
Well a big man got on the riverboat our last time in St Paul
He had a lotta money but his luck went bad and the riverboat won it all
He said I dealt from the bottom of the deck and he pulled a shiny knife
But before that gambler lunged at me my fortyfour took his life
Riverboat riverboat...
 banjo 
Well they came on the boat and they took me to jail when we got to Tennessee
A gamblin' man has very few friends guess nobody cared for me
Well I might be here for a many long years but if I ever get out
I'm gonna head straight for that levee and get me a riverboat headin' south
Riverboat riverboat... <start> standing in line at the grocery store
it's February as cold as it gets
there's a little girl in front of me with no coat on
her mama's buying tampons and cigarettes
i try to catch her eye give her a smile
tell her it's gonna be okay but it might take awhile
chorus
everybody's got something that they're searching for
Tuesday night standing in line at the grocery store
the cashier seemed a little distracted
he's staring off into space
he's welldressed and handsome
fiftysomething and he seems so out of place
he looks like a football coach who just lost his way
maybe he drinks too much but who am i to say
chorus
we all stare at the magazines
movie stars and beauty queens
everything that we're supposed to be
times are hard right now
but we all get by some how
up and down the aisles of the American dream
everybody's got something that their searching for
everybody's got something that their searching for
Tuesday night
marching in time
standing in line at the grocery store <start> I'm just driftwood on the river floating down the tide
I don't care where this old river carries me
I keep drifting just because my heart is broken inside
And I'm tired of wishing for what cannot be

But it's always good luck how we got to say goodbye
I must wander on to keep my rendezvous
Though I drift through town and city I can never stay
For I find no place to call my home sweet home
I don't ask for help or pitty I just go my way
All I'm praying for is peace to dream alone

Where the deep blue sea may help me to forget someone
Yes the careless one who has forgotten me
In my heart I don't feel bitter over what has been
I feel sorry for the one I must forget
And instead of being someone with the world to win
I'm just driftwood on the river of regret <start> Willie Johnson was locking up his store Monday night
And someone snuck in and they commenced a fight
His wife Emilia found him lying on the freezer floor
Now this sleepy little town it ain't sleepy no more
Sheriff Walker holds three local boys in jail
They confessed right down to the last detail
They beat Willie with a bat He was  years old
Then they bought some beer with the six dollars they stole
Well I know my anger is not politically cool
But brother we're in danger when kids can be so cruel as to kill for play
Dear God have mercy we're liven just like there's no judgment day
Billy Haney is the youngest of the three accused
His grandpa got him as a baby hungry and abused
But no one guessed the depth of his emotional scares
Till we saw him on the news grinning like a movie star
Well I know my anger is not politically cool
But brother we're in danger when we can be so cruel as throw our kids away
Dear God have mercy we're living just like there's no judgment day <start> I wake up in the morning radio alarming
Turn it off snuggle and kiss
Gotta get going can't let go
You say Wait just one more minute
Finally make it out of bed now look how late it's getting
We should be at work but instead
We crawl back under covers loving one another
Your love I'm gonna miss
You brush your teeth and hair you're rushing everywhere
Trying to make up some time
You're throwing down your robe you sort through all your clothes
Watching you I can't help but smile
With a smirk you ask Hey what you laughing at
I grin and say at the best there is
With loving in your eyes you hug with all your might
Your love I'm gonna miss
Now fate had a different plan
I let you slip right through my hands
Your memory is all I got left
And your love I'm gonna miss
At night we drift asleep and talk of things
The afterglow of the love that we've made
How was your day Yeah mine was fine
Are you sure your boss don't mind you coming in late
In and out of sleep I catch you watching me
And on my shoulder I feel your caress
Then I go to dreaming never dream a dream
That your love I'm gonna miss
Fate had a different plan
I let you slip right through my hands
Your memory is all I got left
And your love I'm gonna miss
I wake up in the morning radio alarming
Brush your teeth and hair you're rushing everywhere

Crawl back under covers loving one another
You're throwing down your robe you sort through all your clothes

I wake up in the morning radio alarming
Brush your teeth and hair you're rushing everywhere
 <start> I'm sitting on top of the world
Just rolling along Just rolling along
I'm quitting the blues of the world
Just singing a song just singing a song
Glory Hallelujah I just phoned the Parson
Hey Par get ready to call
Just like Humpty Dumpty I'm going to fall
I'm sitting on top of the world
Just rolling along Just rolling along
I'm sitting on top of the world
Just rolling along just rolling along
I'm quitting the blues of the world
Just singing a song just singing a song
Glory Hallelujah I just phoned the Parson
Hey Par get ready to call
Just like Humpty Dumpty I'm going to fall
I'm sitting on top of the world <start> Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care who's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone <start> there i was the girl that you love to hate but hate to love alone i guess you might say yes i was and there you were giving me love enough for any girl to understand this girl couldn't see
chorus
i was the same old fool but in any fantasy same old fool with the same old dream still the same old me show me have life can be now the same old fool has got a brand new dream
one more chance is all that i ever need 'cause you gave to me a shred of hope more than most receive and here i am now that i finally finally finally found what real love means this brand new dream won't end
repeat chorus
instrumental break
repeat chorus to fade out <start> Born to lose I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose it seems so hard to bear
How I long to always have you near
You've grown tired and now you say we're through
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose my every hope is gone
It's so hard to face an empty dawn
You were all the happiness I knew
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
There's no use to dream of happiness
All I see is only loneliness
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose and now I'm losing you <start> I Wish I'd Have A Circle Driveway
Don Williams
Joe Allen
Album Portrait
I wish I had a circle driveway
There's too much for me to leave behind
If I only had a circle driveway
I'd just ride around and wave goodbye
I really can't believe she packed my suitcase
I can't believe that both her eyes were dry
The only thing we didn't have together
Is a right now badly needed circle drive
I Wish I had a circle driveway
There's too much for me to leave behind
If I only had a circle driveway
I'd just ride around and wave goodbye
Well I'll slam it in reverse and watch for traffic
'Cause I don't want the kids to see me cry
It's time to head a new direction
So I'll do my best to get it into drive
I Wish I had a circle driveway
There's too much for me to leave behind
If I only had a circle driveway
I'd just ride around and wave goodbye <start> You can say you love me
And I'll believe that's true
Trusting you is easy
'cause I believe in you
There is nothing I would miss
As long as we're in love like this
Chorus
All I have is all I need
And it all comes down to you and me
How far away this world becomes
In the harbor of each others arms
I feel like I've known you forever and ever
Baby that's how close we are
Right here with you is where my life has come together
And where love has filled my heart
You know I'd go anywhere
As long as I have you to care
Chorus
Oohand with the love you bring
I never want for anything
I found what I've been searching for in you
Chorus <start> I picked up the phone
She said hey it's me
I know it feels like forever since I've heard your voice
But I guess that's how it had to be
So we talked awhile
'Til she said I better go
But before we hung up she said
There's something you need to know
I found someone
It just happened outta the blue
Even though I'm moving on
It don't mean that I don't still love you
And you'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
I found someone
Well I wasn't surprised
Still it hit me kinda hard
It's hard to believe a little space and time
Could turn into miles and worlds apart
I said I'm happy for you
You deserve the very best
Since you've been gone I've done some praying
Some searching for myself
And I found someone
It just happened outta the blue
And even though I'm moving on
It don't mean that I don't still love you
And you'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
I found someone
But it took tears and time down on my knees
And it's not who you'd ever guess
Or who I dreamed it'd be
But in the mirror one morning looking back at me
I found someone
It just happened outta the blue
And it took everything I had
It took me losing you
But you'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
Looking for my place under the sun
I found someone <start> Life sure gets lonely alone no one to talk to along
Nights sure get longer since you've gone don't keep me lonely too long
I need your arms to hold me and hear you say you need me
Don't let me live on dreams alone don't keep me lonely too long
Memories of faithful one so lonely
My tortured heart cries out because it loves and wants you only
Yes I'm too lonely alone afraid of being alone without your love I can't go on
Don't keep me lonely too long don't keep me lonely too long <start> I woke up again this morning
And wouldn't you know it pouring rain
I went and burned a pot of coffee
And like us I poured it down the drain
'Cause I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad come back song
I know I've said I wouldn't miss you
But now I'm saying I'm a fool
You're on the feel good side of leaving
And I'm the backside of a mule
And I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my so sad come back song
And now I'm laying down without you
In this king size empty bed
And I wish I had my arms around you
But I'll just dream of you instead
'Cause I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my get back come back
Hey I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go and letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad come back song
Oh yeah yeah
I know I said I wouldn't miss you
I said I wouldn't miss you girl yeah
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
We all sang na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na yeah
Come on now
So this is my my get bad come back song <start> I'll drive by your house sometime tonight and hope I can see you again
Have a light in your window if you are free one if for him two if for me
If he's there with you I'll drive round the block he might leave before I get back
Have a light in your window so I can see one if for him two if for me
Each time you leave I take this place but we both know I can't stay too long
So have a light in your window so I can see one if for him two if for me <start> He's got a US flag on his front porch to remind everyone where he lives
And up in the attic there are papers that prove the old house is finally his
After thirty five years the grass still don't grow in that rock hard west Texas ground
Where my old dad still clings to that old coyote town
Like horses the pickups are parked out in front of a cafe that don't need a name
Where the old men rock as the tumbleweeds roll
Pass the boarded up windows down Main
Waist high weeds hide a forsale sign at the drivein where my innocence died
With a rusty advertisement dangling by a nail says popcorn and pepsi for a dime
And down at the depot where I left for good
There's a hobo and his three legged hound
Waitin' for a train that no longer comes to that old coyote town
And the interstate rumbles like a river that runs
To a rhythm that don't ever slow down
As cars and trucks and time pass by that old coyote town
Daddy falls asleep in the living room on the sofa with the TV on
Sometimes he waits for a phone call from me sometimes he waits too long
But I still think of people and the place that he loves
How much longer will they be around
'Til it's aches to aches dust to dust for that old coyote town
Like horses the pickups are parked out in front of a cafe that don't need a name
Where the old men rock as the tumbleweeds roll
Pass the boarded up windows down Main
And the interstate rumbles like a river that runs
To a rhythm that don't ever slow down
As cars and trucks and time pass by that old coyote town
God bless that old coyote town <start> Hush little darling celebrate
Today's gonna be your birthday
Even if it's not the th of September
Sometimes down here you will find
Life won't give you peace of mind
It's like you're holding on to a dying ember
Someday you'll be fine
Sweet as wine
But it's alright to remember
I am where you're at
Close your eyes and you'll see
That you'll remember
From time to time
Hush little darling don't you cry
You're the apple of my eye
Always have been always will be forever
Wish you will or wish you won't
You do things you think you don't
You can grow a rose right out of the winter
Someday you'll be fine
Sweet as wine
But it's alright to remember
I am where you're at
Close your eyes and you'll see
That you'll remember
From time to time
Someday you'll be fine
Sweet as wine
But it's alright to remember
I am where you're at
Close your eyes and you'll see
That you'll remember
From time to time
Remember
Remember everything
Remember <start> I wanna go where you go do what you do
Love when you love then I'll be happy
I wanna sigh when you sigh cry when you cry
Smile when you smile then I'll be happy
If you go north or south if you go east or west
I'll follow you sweetheart and share your little love nest
I wanna go where you go do what you do
Love when you love then I'll be happy

Love when you love then I'll be happy

Smile when you smile then I'll be happy
If you go north or south if you go east or west ... <start> He's Cadillac Jack Favor and the name rings true
If he's got a ride any stranger would too
The one bad habit that his Ponder would say
Is sure gonna put him through the trials one day
And that's just what happened he took pity on two men
Heading down to Louisiana he stopped and let them in
And the thanks he did for helping them
Would make him wish he was busting broncs again
He dropped them off in Bossieer City where they met up with a man
That vagabond commitee barely even had a plan
It was just a simple robbery turned double homicide
They got away with murder it'd be someone else's hide
Almost two years come and gone they never solved that crime
'Til they found one of our vagabonds already doing time
When that jailbird started singing they all knew the words were wrong
But the sheriff and the DA and the judge all sang along
They pinned it on Jack Favor gave him life without parole
Gave Jack's freedom to the jailbird payment on the lies he told
Just so happens that election year everybody payed out at the polls
Cadillac's no fallen hero and he's never gonna break
When it comes to prison rodeo there'll be no easy eight
And if you want the definition of the pictureperfect frame
It'd be in the dictionary underneath Jack Favor's name
Cadillac's no fallen hero and he's never gonna break
When it comes to prison rodeo there's still no easy eight
And if you want the definition of the pictureperfect frame
It'd be in the dictionary underneath Jack Favor's name
Yeah it's the world's most crooked picture and when it comes to being framed
Cadillac Jack Favor should be in the hall of fame <start> Adalida pretty little Cajun queen
Sweet Dixie flower the bell of the bayou
You're every young mans dream
Adalida I'd walk through the hurricane
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida I'd swim the Ponchartrain
Oh no here ya coming down the road
With your cotton dress a swishing
You're getting some attention
From all the boys in Thibodaux
Oh my you're really filling up their eyes
Smiling and a winking
I know what they're thinking
But I'm the only one who loves you so
Adalida pretty little Cajun queen
Sweet Dixie flower the bell of the bayou
You're every young mans dream
Adalida I'd walk through the hurricane
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida I'd swim the Ponchartrain
Oh no the hottest little dish I know
I know that you can tell it
You're making me so jealous
From my head down to my toes
Oh me you could make a red neck green
The way that you're a looking
You got me a cooking
And I ain't talking bout Etoufee'
Adalida pretty little Cajun queen
Sweet Dixie flower the bell of the bayou
You're every young mans dream
Adalida I'd walk through the hurricane
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida I'd swim the Ponchartrain
Adalida pretty little Cajun queen
Sweet Dixie flower the bell of the bayou
You're every young mans dream
Adalida I'd walk through the hurricane
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida I'd swim the Ponchartrain
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida
Just to stand beside of my sweet Adalida
I'd swim the Ponchartrain <start> O the dragons are gonna fly tonight
They're circling low and inside tonight
It's another round in the losing fight
Out along the great divide tonight
We are aging soldiers in an ancient war
Seeking out some half remembered shore
We drink our fill and still we thirst for more
Asking if there's no heaven what is this hunger for
Our path is worn our feet are poorly shod
We lift up our prayer against the odds
And fear the silence is the voice of God
And we cry Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah
Sorrow is constant and the joys are brief
The seasons come and bring no sweet relief
Time is a brutal but a careless thief
Who takes our lot but leaves behind the grief
It is the heart that kills us in the end
Just one more old broken bone that cannot mend
As it was now and ever shall be amen
And we cry Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah
So there'll be no guiding light for you and me
We are not sailors lost out on the sea
We were always headed toward eternity
Hoping for a glimpse of Gaililee
Like falling stars from the universe we are hurled
Down through the long loneliness of the world
Until we behold the pain become the pearl
Cryin ' Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah
And we cry Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah <start> The second she walked through the door I caught a buzz
One taste from your lips knocked me out just like a drug
The rest of the night's kind of blurry
Now the sun's peeking through the shades
I can't help but laugh 'cause I kind of like feeling this way
I woke up up still drunk drunk
On your love love on your love love love
Now I know whyy I'm feeling so high high
'Cause I'm still drunk drunk on your love on your love oh yeah
It's not in the whiskey tequila or the wine
It's all about the touch and the fire in your eyes
It gets me fumbling always stumbling through a haze
I got plenty to do just laying here with you all day
I woke up up still drunk drunk
On your love love on your love love love
Now I know whyy I'm feeling so high high
'Cause I'm still drunk drunk on your love on your love oh
Wish I could bottle you up and drink you in all day long
Every day singing this song
I woke up up still drunk drunk
On your love love on your love love love
Now I know whyy I'm feeling so high high
'Cause I'm still drunk drunk on your love on your love

On your love on your love
On your love
On your love on your love
On your love get drunk on your love yeah
I'm so drunk <start> Down in Louisiana where the black trees grow lives a voodoo lady named Marie Leveau
She got a black cat tooth and a mojo bone and anyone wouldn't leave her alone
She go  another man done gone
She lives in a swamp in a hollow log with a one eyed snake and a three legged dog
She got a bent bony body and stringy hair
And if she ever seen you all messin' round there
She go  another man done gone
And then one night when the moon was black into the swamp come Handsome Jack
A no good man like you all know when he was lookin' around for Marie Leveau
He said Marie Leveau you lovely witch gimme little charm that'll make me rich
Gimme million dollars and I tell you what I'll do this very night I'm gonna marry you
And it'll be ummmmmmm another man done gone
So Marie done some magic and she shook a little sand
Made a million dollars and she put it in his hands
Then she giggled and she wiggled and she said hey hey
I'm gettin' ready for my weddin' day
But ol' Handsome Jack he said goodbye Marie
You're too damn ugly for a rich man like me
Then Marie started numblin' her fangs started gnashin'
Her body started tremblin' and her eyes started flashin'
And she went  another man done gone
So if you ever get down where the black trees grow
And meet a voodoo lady named Marie Leveau
If she ever asks you to make her your wife
Man you better stay with her for the rest of your life
Or it'll be  another man done gone <start> 
Ridin' on The City of New Orleans
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Two conductors and atwentyfive sacks a' mail
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
And moves on along past houses farms and fields
Passin' trains what ain't got no names
Switch yards full a' old black men
And the graveyards full of them rusted automobiles
Chorus
Good mornin' America how are ya
Well a don'tcha know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
And I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
Adealin' cards with an old man down in the club car
Just a penny a point ain't anobody keepin' score
Say won't you pass that there paper bag that's awrappin' the bottle
Feel them wheels rumblin' under that floor
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their daddy's magical carpet made out of steel
Mamas with their babies asleepin'
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rockin' rails is all they feel
Chorus
Good mornin' America how are ya
Well a don'tcha know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
And I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
Nighttime on The City of New Orleans
Achangin' cars adown in Memphis Tennessee
Well a half way home and a we gonna be there by mornin'
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rollin' down to that sea
Now all a' them towns and all the people seem
To fade away into a bad ol' dream
But the steel rail well he still ain't heard that news
Conductor's asingin' that song again
Sayin' Passengers will please refrain
This train done got the disappearin' railroad blues
Chorus
Good night America how are ya
Well a don'tcha know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
And I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
Fade out.
Mamas with their babies asleepin'
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rockin' rails is all they feel
Mamas with their babies asleepin'
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rockin' rails is all they feel
Yeah. <start> Every day I tell myself it's temporary
That it's only 'cause she's young
That makes her want... another man
Even though she makes me feel unnecessary
I've found a way to help me understand
I've got this drinkin' thing
To keep from thinkin' things
About where you've been
Who you've been with
What you've done
And it's a lonely thing
But it's the only thing
To keep a foolish man in love
Hangin' on.
If I wait at home I'll only ask her questions
She'd probably the truth so I don't even ask
So I sit here on this barstool feelin' helpless
And I wonder just how long a man can last
I've got this drinkin' thing
To keep from thinkin' things
About where you've been
Who you've been with
What you've done
And it's a lonely thing
But it's the only thing
To keep a foolish man in love
Hangin' on.
I've got this drinkin' thing
To keep from thinkin' things
About where you've been
Who you've been with
What you've done. <start> Piercing words eyes are red
Watched your taillights in the rain
Empty heart filled with regret
I know we were both to blame
And I'm not sorry that it's over
But for the way we let it end
So I said all I had to say
In letters that I threw away
And you should know please believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number but it's been so long
It's never easy it's like tryin' to spin the world the other way
What can I say
How did it come to this
I think about you all the time
It's no excuse but I wish
That I never made you cry
I'm not sorry that it's over
But for the way we let it end
I couldn't find the words to say
And you should know please believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number but it's been so long
It's never easy it's like tryin' to spin the world the other way
So what can I say What can I say
What can I say What can I say
I hate to think all you had of me

Is a memory I left you space between what was meant to be

And the mess that it turned into
And you should know please believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number but it's been so long
It's never easy it's like tryin' to spin the world the other way
It's like tryin' to spin the world the other way
What can I say What can I say
What can I say <start> No one ever said life would be easy
One good look around and that's easy to see
And it's so hard to know just what to believe in
But you can take it for granted
You can always believe in me
Chorus
I would carry the world on my shoulders
Juggle the moon and the stars
No mountain I couldn't get over
Never a bridge too far
To be there whenever you need me
There's nothing I would not do
If I'm breathing air
I will be there for you
No matter how strong we'll all need somebody to lean on
We'll all have to reach for a hand now and then
No I'm not someone who has all the answers
If you'll just let me try I'll help you find them again and again
Chorus <start> Our guardian star lost all his glow
The day that I lost you
He lost all his glitter the day you said no
And his grey skies turned to blue
Like him I am doubtful that your love is true
So if you decide to call on me
Ask for Mister Blue
I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you love me
Then prove it by goin' out on the sly
Provin' your love is untrue
Call me Mr. Blue
I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you're sorry
Then turn around headed for the lights of town
Hurtin' me through and through
Call me Mr. Blue
I sleep alone each night
Wait by the phone each night
But you don't call
And I won't hurt my pride
Call me mister I won't tell you
When you paint the town
A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm painting it too
But I'm painting it blue
I sleep alone each night
Wait by the phone each night
But you don't call
And I won't hurt my pride
Call me mister I won't tell you
When you paint the town
A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm painting it too
But I'm painting it blue
Call me Mr. Blue
Call me Mister <start> There's no reason to be seen
No one knows where i have been
Where i have been
I mean love is what i mean
Joy joy and jubilee
Joy joy and jubilee
Joy joy and jubilee
Joy joy and jubilee
This is what i want to be
Everything inside of me
Inside of me
Where only shoes should be
Joy joy and jubilee
Joy joy and jubilee
Joy joy and jubilee
Joy joy and jubilee <start> Can you not see what you've done
You gave your heart away like that.
I didn't want to fall in love with anyone but you did.
I can still hear the song
The melody behind the kiss you gave me.
You were wrong I was right so I walked away
And left you there alone
I got so tired of talkin' on the telephone
How many times would we say the words goodbye
I made mistakes and one was telling you that I'd be there
When telling time had come
I should've said I didn't care.
Oh the time I would have saved
If I had been less willing to accommodate
You'd been a little less likely to cry.
You go back to the high life
And I'll go back to the low.
I should've known but now I know
There'll be no word from you
Describing how it felt to go through what I put you through.
It all makes perfect sense.
The way you cut the rope
That kept you dangling from such pitiful amounts of hope
I would have cut it too. <start> Mama said slow down
But I was goin' to fast to listen
Said what goes 'round comes around
But only time could get my attention
But as I look back now
Over advice we were given
I can't help wonderin how
It is that I'm still livin
I had some wild friends
We did some crazy things
We'd get some long late hours
We dared the lightnin'
We took it to the edge
Runnin' full speed ahead
We laid our lives on the line
We dared the lightnin'
Really blows my mind
I don't know how did I survive
And still I go back from time to time
Visit others by their grave site
Wish momma had lived to see
Now I have kids of my own
She'd be laughin' at me
But momma never cast a stone
I had some wild friends
We did some crazy things
We'd get some long late hours
We dared the lightnin'
We took it to the edge
Runnin' full speed ahead
We laid our lives on the line
We dared the lightnin'
It was like playin Russian Roulette
Always braggin' and bluffin'
Racin 'round and dodgin' bullets
We never stopped at nothin'
I had some wild friends
We did some crazy things
We'd get some long late hours
We dared the lightnin'
We took it to the edge
Runnin' full speed ahead
We laid our lives on the line
We dared the lightnin'
We laid our lives on the line
We dared the lightnin' <start> Jesus Saviour pilot me over life's tempestuous sea
Unknown waves before me roll hiding rock and treach'rous shoal

Ribbon of darkness over me
Since my true love walked out the door
Tears I never had before
Ribbon of darkness over me
Clouds are gathering over my head
That kill the day and hide the sun
That shroud the night when day is done
Ribbon of darkness over me
Rain is falling on the meadow
Where once my love and I did lie
Now she is gone from the meadow
My love goodbye
Ribbon of darkness over me
Where once the world was young as spring
Where flowers did bloom and birds would sing
Ribbon of Darkness over me
In this cold room lying
Don't want to see no one but you
Lord I wish I could be dying
To forget you
How I wish your old heart could see
How mine just takes and breaks all day
Come on back and take away
Ribbon of Darkness over me
Come on back and take away
Ribbon of Darkness over me <start> Death is an angel sent down from above sent for the buds and the flowers we love
Truly 'tis so for in heaven's own way each soul is a flower in the Master's bouquet
Gathering flowers for the Master's bouquet beautiful flowers that will never decay
Gathered by angels and carried away forever to bloom in the Master's bouquet
Loved ones are passing each day and each hour passing away as the life of a flower
But every bud and each blossom some day
Will bloom as a flower in the Master's bouquet
Gathering flowers for the Master's bouquet...
Now let us be faithful till life's work is done
Blooming with love till the reaper shall come
Then we'll be gathered together that day
Transplanted to bloom in the Master's bouquet
Gathering flowers for the Master's bouquet... <start> We are
Counting the stars
Out in the night
Round an old yellow moon
With you
Right by my side
I got nothing to hide
From an old yellow moon
And now
As I turn back the years
So little I've learned
About heartache and tears
Chorus
But still
I'm making my way
Into the heart
Of an unknown highway
We are
Following stars
Way cross the sky
Round an old yellow moon
Chorus
We are
Counting the stars
Out in the night
Round an old yellow moon
Out in the night
Round an old yellow moon <start> So this is how it ends
This is where it all goes down
This is what I don't love you feels like
It ain't the middle of the night
And it ain't even raining outside
It ain't exactly what I had in mind
For goodbye
At a red light
In the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothin' to say don't even try
Some are comin' home
Some are leavin' town
While my world's crashin' down on a Sunday
In the sunshine
At a red light
I thought she was gonna say
Somethin' about that couple kissin' crossin' the street
Or somethin' about this beautiful day
But she just looked me in the eye
Said it's over
Didn't try to lie
Or pick a fight
I might have seen it comin' thata way
But at a red light
In the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothin' to say don't even try
Some are comin' home
Some are leavin' town
While my world's crashin' down on a Sunday
In the sunshine
At a red light
There's a momma calmin' down a little baby in the backseat
in front of me
There's an old man dressed in his Sunday best just waitin' on green
But I can't see
gettin' past
This red light
In the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothin' to say don't even try
Some are comin' home
Some are leavin' town
While my world's crashin' down on a Sunday
in the sunshine 
At a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothin' to say don't even try
Some are comin' home
Some are leavin' town
While my world's crashin' down
On a Sunday
In the sunshine
At a red light
At a red light
At a red light
At a red light <start> SCOTLAND IS AN INSTRUMENTAL <start> Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming
Saying something about a queen
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at mother nature on the run
In the twentieth century
Look at mother nature on the run
In the twentieth century
I was lying in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eye
I was hoping for replacement
When the sun burst through the sky
There was a band playing in my head
And I felt like I could cry
I was thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
Thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There was children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream all in a dream the loading had begun
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home <start> A perfect kind of love is what you want from me if I could I'd gladly give you more
But I'm so afarid I could never paint for you the pretty pictures you are searching for
You're wearing rose colored glasses everywhere you go
Cause you only want to see the brighter sight
Rose colored glasses cause someone has hurt you so
And rose colored glasses help you high
Into every life a little rain must fall and that's the way that it will always be
But you seem to think you can keep the hurt away just by pretending you don't see
You're wearing rose colored glasses... <start> This road that I've chosen it's a road that few have traveled
But there's good times with the hard times along the way
And this life that I'm livin' God knows that I love it
And I like to share it with you if I may
So I write my songs of life as I know it
And I sing them for everyone to hear
And in my songs I hope you understand just a little
What it's like to be a rodeo man <start> All alone you say
That you don't want no other
So the lord is love and love is like no other
If the falling tide can turn and then recover
All alone we must be part of one another
All alone you say
The power is perfection
Is the power of peace or merely the connection
To the God of love that powers the protection
From the tide of life that flows in each direction
When the stream of changing days
Turns around in so many ways
Then the pilot of the mind must find the right direction
All alone you say
That you don't want no other
So the lord is love and love is like no other
If the falling tide can turn and then recover
All alone we must be part of one another
When the stream of changing days
Turns around in so many ways
Then the pilot of the mind must find the right direction <start> I'LL LET MY HEART BREAK FOR A LITTLE WHILE

I'll let my heart break for a little while
Who cares if it aches for a little while
I'll hold you so close for a little while
And then I'll go my way and forget
I know that it's wrong I shouldn't do this to you
I know that it's wrong I shouldn't make you blue
But I'll let my heart break for a little while
Then I'll go my way and forget
Honey I'll let my heart break for a little while
And who cares if it aches for just a little while
And I'll hold you oh so close for a little while
And then I'll go I'll go my way and forget
Oh I know that it's wrong...
About you <start> Sittin' alone in the moonlight
Thinking of the days gone by
Wondering about my darling
I can still hear her saying goodbye
Oh the moon grows pale as I sit here
Each little star seems to whisper and say
Your sweetheart has found another
And now she's far far away
Sittin' alone in the moonlight
Thinking of the days gone by
Wondering about my darling
I can still hear her saying goodbye
Oh the moon grows pale as I sit here
Each little star seems to whisper and say
Your sweetheart has found another
And now she's far far away <start> If it was up to the boss I think he'd work you to death
We got bills to pay and we're up to our necks in debt
I went to pick up the truck the radiator still leaks
Sometimes it feels like we're stuck with no paddle up a creek
Baby when it's down to me and you
We leave our worries at the door
We got more important things to do
Baby when it's down to me and you
We just make up for life's little problems
By makin' love the whole night through
Well the price of groceries goes up every day
Seems like our hardearned money just up and flies away
Sometimes it feels like we're backed in a corner up against the wall
But puttin' up with the hassles isn't really a hassle at all 'cause
Baby when it's down to me and you
We leave our worries at the door
We got more important things to do
Baby when it's down to me and you
We just make up for life's little problems
By makin' love the whole night through
We'll lock the world outside
Oh we've made up our minds
Love is all that matters tonight
Baby when it's down to me and you
We leave our worries at the door
We got more important things to do
Baby when it's down to me and you
We just make up for life's little problems
By makin' love the whole night through <start> I've been a walking heartache
I've made a mess of me
The person that I've been lately
Ain't who I wanna be
But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm goes through
And I need you
'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
For when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say it's true
God gave me you gave me you
There's more here than what were seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr
And I'll be the flattered fool
And I need you yeah
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
For when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say it's true
God gave me you
On my own I'm only
Half of what I could be
I can't do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered
I pray we never undo
'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say it's true
God gave me you gave me you
He gave me you <start> 
She was born in a place called Blue Valley
At the foot of the Tennessee hills
With the blue birds and blue bells
And blue mountain water
And the sound of the Blue Whippoorwill
But there was no peace in the valley
Her daddy a cruel ruthless man
Used and abused her mind and her body
So her mama said run while you can
So at fifteen she took to the highway
Belongings and guitar in hand
And she buried herself in her music
The one thing she did understand
And she sings like a bird and she writes like a poet
Her voice has that high lonesome sound
She hurts and her songs are the best way to show it
So the Blue Valley songbird keeps traveling around
She hopes someday she will make it
And everyone says that she will
When she comes to town crowds flock around
To see the girl from the Tennessee hills
She writes her letter back home to her mama
In care of the preacher in town
They're sacred to her so she reads them at church
And so her daddy cannot track her down
And she sings like a bird and she cries like a baby
Whenever she turns off the lights
She's a whole lot lonesome and a little bit crazy
From mem'ries and miseries and dreams gone awry
Blue dress blue shoes a blue Cadillac
A band dressed in blue by her side
Instruments tied to the top and the back
'Cause the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight
One nighters honky tonks years flying by
She never made it but Lord knows she tries
Expressing the feelings she holds inside
And the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight
Oh the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight
And she sings like a bird and she writes like a poet <start> I tried to find you at the bottom of a bottle
Laying down on the bathroom floor
My loneliness was a rattle in the windows
You said you don't want me anymore
And you left me
Standing on a corner crying
Feeling like a fool for trying
I don't even remember why I'm wasting all these tears on you
I wish I could erase our memory
'Cause you didn't give a damn about me
Oh finally I'm through
Wasting all these tears on you
These tears on you
You ain't worth another sleepless night
And I'll do everything I gotta do to get you off my mind
'Cause what you wanted I couldn't get
What you did boy I'll never forget
And you left me
Standing on a corner crying
Feeling like a fool for trying
I don't even remember why I'm wasting all these tears on you
I wish I could erase our memory
'Cause you didn't give a damn about me
Oh finally I'm through
Wasting all these tears on you
These tears on you
And you left me
Standing on a corner crying
Feeling like a fool for trying
I don't even remember why I'm wasting all these tears on you
I wish I could erase our memory
'Cause you didn't give a damn about me
Oh finally I'm through
Wasting all these tears on you
These tears on you
I tried to find you at the bottom of a bottle
Laying down on the bathroom floor <start> As American as apple pie Mom and homemade jam
As proud as punch and peacocks you know I am I am
An AllAmerican girl what knows good music and good times
Red white and bluegrass I'm not color blind
st Chorus
Red white and bluegrass...red white and blue
These are my true colors and I love my bluegrass too
America America let pride and freedom ring
Red white and bluegrass let's all stand up and sing
Where else but in America can people live so free
And I'm proud of every soldier that has stood and fought for me
And I'm proud of every bluegrass band that's ever picked a lick
And I'm proud to be American that's why I'm a singin' this
nd Chorus
Red white and bluegrass...red white and blue
These are my true colors and I love my bluegrass too
America America let pride and freedom ring
Red white and bluegrass let's all stand up and sing and pick

Fade
Red white and bluegrass red white and blue
Red white and blue oohoohooh
Red white and blue <start> I think I'll go across the ocean
If I don't change my notion
I just got to forget you if I can
Oh I'm feeling so blue
I don't know what to do
For I'm head over heels in love with you
Every day is sad and lonely
For I'm thinking of you only
Oh I just can't sleep when I lay down
Oh I'm feeling so blue
I don't know what to do
For I'm head over heels in love with you
Oh the nights are long and dreary
All I do is sit and worry
I just can't bear the thought of losing you
Oh I'm feeling so blue
I don't know what to do
For I'm head over heels in love with you
Oh I like to be forgiven
But this life ain't worth living
If I have to sit and worry over you
Oh I'm feeling so blue
I don't know what to do
For I'm head over heels in love with you
For I'm head over heels in love with you <start> Yeah I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you oh yeah
I'm gonna start with the halls take the pictures off the walls and break 'em
Move the chairs around take the window curtains down and burn 'em
Everything I see reminds me you were here
Yeah I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you oh yeah
The candle of your set you gave me on the night of my birthday
The records that you bought the hifi we loved to play
The decorating man will come and rearrange them
Yeah I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you oh yeah
Take the carpet off the floor throw it out the door it's filled with tears
Everything I find that brings you to my mind must disappear
Every night I dream I'll dream of someone new
Yeah I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you
Yeah I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you
Yeah I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you <start> 

It was a man's world for a day and a half
Adam had a garden for a bachelor pad
But something was missing in his paradise
Then along came eve the apple of his eye
Without hesitation he gave into temptation
cause God created woman to raise a little cain
Gave her a softer side put fire into her eyes to drive a man insane
He knew what he was doing cause history has proven
Since God created woman man's never been the same
Old christopher columbus would have never set sail
Without a little push from isabel
Alexander graham invented the phone
So his wife could ring a bell when she wanted his home
Some feminine persistence can make a world of difference
cause God created woman to raise a little cain
Gave her a softer side put fire into her eyes to drive a man insane
He knew what he was doing cause history has proven
Since God created woman man's never been the same
It's all a part of the plan for the good of every man
cause God created woman to raise a little cain
Gave her a softer side put fire into her eyes to drive a man insane
He knew what he was doing cause history has proven
Since God created woman man's never been the same <start> I have a safe and sure retreat where I'm alone with God
A perfect peace and happiness where sorrow never trod
Oh praise his name his holy name salvation full and free
Ol' glory to the blessed lamb my Saviour leads the way
My Saviour leads the way my Saviour leads the way
My soul was lost in deep despair till Jesus came to me
But now I'm safe thank God I'm safe because of calvary
I'm following his footsteps my Saviour leads the way
 steel 
My burdens all seem lighter when I steal away and pray
I feel his presence and I know he's with me all the way
Alone with him I'll watch and wait I know it won't be long
Till I shall stand before my Lord and sing a happy song
My Saviour leads the way... <start> The very first time I ever saw my Tommy love
He came dancing into my room
And I felt the sunlight sparkle warm
Out from his magic shoes
And he danced so proud
And he laughed so wild
And he charmed me like a piper
When he smiled
So dance with me dance with me sing with me can't you see
I'm following the rainbow kissed strands of your magic carol
Follow your joyful song anywhere anywhere my raggedy magical music man
For I am only your tag along raggedy anne and I want you to hold me
As long as your raggedy magical music carol can
He asked me if I'd like to have my own parade
I answer yes and he blew his golden horn
Then the violins and the trumpets rang out he led them all
In a coat of many colors patched and torn
And he swung me to a loving sound
While the fiddlers played and pranced around
He spun so fast 'til we left the ground
Then the music filled the heavens with a joyful noise
The stars would dance to greet us as we'd come
Then he'd wave his hand and send them back to the morning light
And we'd keep climbing through the midnight sun
On a rocking horse with wings we'd fly
To a place where dreams can never die
Lovers little children in the sky
So dance with me dance with me sing with me can't you see
I'm following the rainbow kissed strands of your magic carol
Follow your joyful song anywhere anywhere my raggedy magical music man
For I am only your tag along raggedyanne and I want you to hold me
As long as your raggedy magical music carol can
And when it came time for my Tommy love to leave
I begged him please to stay and save my soul
And with a fading voice I heard him say as he <start> When other arms have held me close and new lips softly called my name
With all our goodbye's said and done you'll still be the one you'll still be the one
The night she tried with all her love to take away your memory
But when I wake up in her arms you'll still be the one you'll still be the one
You'll still be the one my crazy heart runs to
And it's unfair I know imagine she's you when I love her
Though time may bring her close to me it's not the same as loving you
And after all it's said and done you'll still be the one you'll still be the one
 piano 
You'll still be the one...
You'll still be the one you'll still be the one <start> Isn't it a pity isn't it a shame
How we break each other's hearts and cause each other pain
How we take each other's love without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back isn't it a pity
Some things take so long but how do I explain
Not too many people can see we're all the same
And because of all their tears their eyes can't hope to see
All the beauty that surrounds them isn't it a pity
Isn't it a pity isn't it a shame
How we break each other's hearts and cause each other pain
How we take each other's love without without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back isn't it a pity
Forgetting to give back isn't it a shame
Forgetting to give back isn't it a pity
Isn't it a pity isn't it a shame
How we break each other's hearts and cause each other pain
Isn't it a pity isn't it a shame
How we take each other's love without thinking anymore
It's a pity it's a shame oh yeah oh yeah
Forgetting to give back it's a pity oh yeah
Isn't it a shame <start> He swore it was over
And all in his past
A few hours later
His hand's 'round a glass
A voice on the left says
There's peace in the wine
From the right a voice whispers
Don't do it this time
When he looks for the answer
Down in his heart
Demons and angels
Tear him apart
She calls his name softly
As she lies in their bed
Listens for footsteps
And prays for the best
She knows that he loves her
Knows that he tries
But if he comes home drinking
She'll leave him tonight
She waits for the answer and
Cries in the dark
While demons and angels
Tear him apart
For so long they've fought for his soul
The whiskey and the woman at home
And they all know he must choose
The winner alone
There's not much that's sweeter
Than a new life begun
Ain't much that's sadder
Than a promise undone
He stares at the bottle
Longs for her arms
While demons and angels
Tear him apart
When he looks for the answer
Down in his heart
There's demons and angels
That tear him apart <start> I never was great at pickin' cotton but Lord I always carried all my rows
There were those who could pick it clean or better
But didn't I pick my cotton with a lot of soul
I'd go hmm with feeling I'd go hmm with soul
I'd say hmm with meaning yeah I sang my songs of life with a lot of soul
 dobro 
I never was great at words so fancy oh but my woman knew I loved her so
There were those who could give her more and better
But didn't I loved that woman with a lot of soul
I'd go hmm with feeling I'd go hmm with soul
I'd go hmm with meaning but Lord I love that woman with a lot of soul
 dobro 
When I leave this life I'll be forgotten cause I never made big tracks upon its roads
Things I've done will never last forever but didn't I do it all with a lot of soul
I'd go hmm with feeling I'd go hmm with soul <start> Stars of our stars.
Dreams of my dreams.
You come to me
Singing  The Stars Of Our Stars.
Chorus
The stars of our stars
Came up the first day.
The moon did set.
The sun comes up.
And all the stars did disappear.
Stars of our stars.
Dreams of my dreams.
You come to me
Dancing to The Stars Of Our Stars.
Chorus
Times at night in the spill of light
You catch a glimpse.
You make a start with an eager heart
But it always slips.
And then everything shifts.
Stars of our stars.
Dreams of my dreams.
You come to me
Trailing The Stars Of Our Stars.
Chorus <start> The fairest bloom the mountain know
Is not an iris or a wild rose
But the little flower of which I'll tell
Known as the brave agony bell
Just a simple flower so small and plain
With a pearly hue and a little known name
But the yellow birds sing when they see it bloom
For they know that spring is coming soon
Well it makes its home mid the rocks and the rills
Where the snow lies deep on the windy hills
And it tells the world why should i wait
This ice and snow is gonna melt away
And so I'll sing that yellow bird's song
For the troubled times will soon be gone <start> You told me that others before you were foolish to cause me to cry
And just when I learned to adore you you kissed one more dream goodbye
And left me lonely again just like you found me lonely again no arms around me
Just when I'm sure that my heart is secure
And my teardrops are dry with a warm glow inside
And this love of mine till the end of the line
That's always the time that I'm lonely again
You told me you wanted me only and this time this love would last
You told me I'd never be lonely but now you belong to the past
And I'm so lonely again... <start> Landslide beneath my feet
Dirt falling under me
I've got nowhere to go
Guess I'll just stand right here
Watch myself disappear again
Slow and low
Guess you could say I'm getting used to it
One day I'm fine the next I'm in a ditch
But I'm not crazy
I'm just losing ground
Doc called some new pills in
I won't pick them up again
Cause I know that stuff's a joke
You can't just dope me up
When I'm down on my luck
I don't need mirrors and smoke
Guess you could say I'm getting used to it
One day I'm fine the next I'm in a ditch
But I'm not crazy
I'm just losing ground <start> I grew up in a town where tough was a cigarette
And a souped up car on a county road
Nothin' much to do back then so we'd make bets
On how much drink a guy could hold
And I held my own
I learned to hold my own
Daddy works some deadend job at the concrete plant
Mama taught the Sunday Bible class
For eighteen years I remember thinkin'
That there was more to life than that so I ran the streets to beat the Devil
Goin' just as fast as I could fly
'Cause I came here to live
I didn't come here to die
Mama used to wait for me with the porch light on
Worried about her little boy 'till I got home
Daddy he'd say Listen son but back then there wasn't much
That I didn't already know
I reckon I was doing close to 
When I felt the tire slip out from underneath
And I never set out lookin' for Jesus
So I guess Jesus come lookin' for me
And He found me upset down in a ditch
Smokin' gas in my eyes
And He said Son you came here to live
You didn't come here to die
Sunday morning I got up and I went to church
That summer I got a job and I went to work
I met a girl in town put some money down
On a little house with a yard
Our little boy was due in September
But he came early in July
For eighteen days all I remember
Was sittin' there at his side
Sayin' Son open up your eyes
Just open up your eyes
'Cause you came here to live
You didn't come here to die
Son you came here to live <start> Papa won't you let me go to town with you
Papa I'm feeling so down and blue
You just gotta come around please do
Papa won't you let me go to town with you
There's a blue dress at Dindy's I'd give the world to see again
I need some hand lotion and some powder from the five and ten
Buy us some chocolate and I'll make you a pretty pie
If ya don't let me go I'll just die
Papa won't you let me go to town with you
Papa I'm feeling so down and blue
You just gotta come around please do
Papa won't you let me go to town with you
I Gotta pick up a pattern Aunt Nora's making me a dress
I scrubbed it this morning what d'ya mean this floor's a mess
I done everything you said and then some ya didn't say to do
You just gotta take me with you
Papa won't you let me go to town with you
Papa I'm feeling so down and blue
You just gotta come around please do
Papa won't you let me go to town with you
Looky here papa I found your other Sunday shoe
I shined it and I shined it till it looks all brand spankin' new
Seems like a year I've been waiting for today
If you let me go I won't get in your way
Papa won't you let me go to town with you
Papa I'm feeling so down and blue
You just gotta come around please do
Papa won't you let me go to town with you <start> You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is going down
Ruby don't take your love to town
It wasn't me who started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chores
Yes it's true I'm not the man I used to be but Ruby I still need your company
 banjo  dobro 
It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralized
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age Ruby I realize
But it won't be long I've heard them say until I'm not around
Ruby don't take your love to town
She's leaving now cause I've just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam one hundred times before
And if I could move I get my gun and put her in the ground
Ruby don't take your love to town
Oh Ruby don't take your love to town for God sakes turn around <start> Verse 
A million reasons why I could
But only one why I won't
Cause the one who'd probably never know
Is the reason that I don't
I can't say that I'm not tempted
I'm just like any other man
But when I walk out of here alone woman
I hope you understand
Chorus
She's standin' on the promises
That she gave to me
So I'm standin' on the promises
I promised her I'd keep
Verse 
It'd be so easy for anyone
To justify the wrong
Fall right into your arms
And say to hell with being strong
But there's one thing I know for sure
She'd never play this kind of game
And for her faith in out love
I'll do her the same cause
Chorus x <start> It was a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre
Did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to slow you never can tell
They furnished off an apartment
With a two room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed
With T.V. Dinners and ginger ale
But when Pierre found work
The little money comin' worked out well
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They had a hifi phono
Boy did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records
All rockin' rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down
The rapid tempo of the music fell
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They bought a soupedup Jimmy
T'was a cherryred fifty three
Drove it down to Orleans
To celebrate their anniversary
It was there that Pierre
Was wedded to the lovely mademoiselle
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell <start> She said she was not the one for me
There was nothing I could do to change her mind
She said she was sorry but some things arent meant to be
She was unaware that she was robbing her heart blind

What she dont know is Ill always love her forever
What she dont know is that Ive never done her wrong
Underestimation will break her heart for sure
What she cant see what she dont know
Wont hurt her but its killing me
Deep in the shadows of the smokey neon lights
I play myself in a lonely game of pool
I chalk it up as he sits down by her side
I take another shot swallow my pride and I play a fool
Chorus
Watching her dance with him
Around that empty hardwood floor
Is like putting sawdust in the wound
And I cry a little more
Chorus <start> There's a fire burning bright
At our house tonight
Slow music playing
And soft candlelight
On her lips I keep tasting
The warm red wine
I'm there in her arms
But it's all in my mind
The snow is piled high on the highway tonight
I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white
Eighteen wheels anchored somewhere out of Dover
I wish I could hold her
Instead of huggin' this old cold shoulder
This old highway
Is like a woman sometimes
She can be your best friend
But she's the real jealous kind
She's the lady that leads me
To the life I dream of
She's the mistress that keeps me
From the ones that I love
The snow is piled high on the highway tonight
I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white
Eighteen wheels anchored somewhere out of Dover
I wish I could hold her
Instead of huggin' this old cold shoulder
God I wish I could hold her
Instead of huggin' this old cold shoulder <start> I see main street closing
Miles of For Sale signs
And them fields ain't growin'
Fast enough to get us by
I feel the sweet release of a Friday night
For a couple of hours we can run this town till it runs dry
Tip it on back make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll off your lips
Let it all go whatever it is and tip it on back
So grab the girl you came with
And set her world on fire
And watch her sway and singing to the music
Until it's all alright yeah
Tip it on back make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll off your lips
Let it all go whatever it is and tip it on back
I don't wanna lose this feeling
And I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna remember what I'm here to forget tonight
So tip it on back
Tip it on back make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll off your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back
Tip it on back
Yeah I don't wanna lose this feeling
I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna remember what I'm here to forget tonight
So tip it on back
Just tip it on back
Feel the sweet release of a Friday night
For a couple of hours gonna run this town till it runs dry
Tip it on back <start> I'd love to have feel from my hiding place
Deeper in love with each passing day
A new love is blinding me but I did not care
Like a sunlight on sand
He wore my soul if love could be bought
Than mine had been sold
I'd be lying if I said he did not move me
Chorus
Were you caught on spider lace
How that morning glowing tends to lose its place
When the sun is in his hug always
And the wind is in his heart
Well I've had my share of dancing around
But dancers like him are seldomly found
Wings on his hand and the sun in his kiss
To careless I was to foolish to see
So easy to love not east to leave
Cheaters always win the losers always weak
Chorus x <start> Everyone has heard me say I don't miss her much today
Cause there's so much more to do than sit and cry
I said many times before I don't love her anymore but to tell the truth I told a lie
It feels so good to get it off my conscience to admit that she's still on my mind
I've tried keeping inside all the bitter tears I've cried
Oh I just laughed it up or at least I gave it a try
Oh when I thought I was at my best I sat and thought of her less and less
But to tell the truth I told a lie
It feels so good to get it off my conscience to admit that she's still on my mind
When I thought I was at my best <start> Lately things just don't feel right between us
We seldom touch when we turn out the lights
What happened to the me and you that once was
Maybe baby it's time for goodbye
Say goodbye to your daddy and bye to your mama
Lay some rubber on the road in this little blue Honda
Leave the bills and the worry
And the fuss and the hurry behind
We'll spend a few good days under the covers
Talkin' and laughin' and actin' like the lovers
We were before life took over our lives
It's time for goodbye
We can head down the road find a bed and skip the breakfast
Go to Yellowstone and taste some sweet red wine
Hell just say where I'll try to have you there by mornin'
Baby don't you think it's time for goodbye
Say goodbye to your daddy and bye to your mama
Lay some rubber on the road in this little blue Honda
Leave the bills and the worry
And the fuss and the hurry behind
We'll spend a few good days under the covers
Talkin' and laughin' and actin' like the lovers
We were before life took over our lives
It's time for goodbye
Pack a little bag and don't take long
Don't need much more than what you got on
Come on let's get gone
Say goodbye to your daddy and bye to your mama
Lay some rubber on the road in this little blue Honda
Leave the bills and the worry
And the fuss and the hurry behind
We'll spend a few good days under the covers
Talkin' and laughin' and actin' like the lovers
We were before life took over our lives
It's time for goodbye it's time for goodbye <start> Hollywood never fails to make a sequel
For each and every movie that does well
Why can't love be more like that
Where the best ones get a second chance
And that way though you're gone
It wouldn't be that long 
I'd see you in part two
And we'd pick up where we left off
When I lost you
And we'd fall in love again
And change the way the story ends
Yeah we'd bring back me and you
In part two
Lookin' back we had so much to look forward to
The kind of love that deserves to be continued
And if this were only Tinseltown
By now they would have figured out
A way for you and I
To give it one more try 
I'd see you in part two
And we'd pick up where we left off
When I lost you
And we'd fall in love again
And change the way the story ends
Yeah we'd bring back me and you
In part two <start> My love
my love
I wanna run
run
My love
take advantage of me
got nowhere to go
nowhere else to be
Nowhere to go nowhere else to be
my love
Never had love
not the kind that lasts
whenever I'd find it
went by so fast
so many years
so many nights
so many dreams lost
to a morning light
So many dreams lost to a morning light
my love
Oh I wanna run 
Oh
My love
my love
let me inside you
help me see
My love
make a difference to me
cause something about you
is something I need
Something about you is something I need 
My love <start> When you give it up for gone
But you're still digging in the mind
And your staring out the window
Saying everything will be just fine
Keepin' with whole affair
Every word seems out of line
No matter what angle you get
It's polished till it shines
Take a guess at where I stand
Pick a number one to two
Take a look at the back of your hand
Just like you know it
You know me too
And when you say who the hell am I living with
What just went down
Where did this come from
Why are all my colors faded brown
When did it change
What's with the rage
Who's the dude with the extrall
What's the verse the line the chapter the page
Take a guess at where I stand
Pick a number one to two
Take a look at the back of your hand
Just like you know it
You know me too
You think you're lost without any place left to go
Like you need one of those kisses long and slow
First glance is not what it seems
But there's some things that I just know
Like you take two sugars with a splash of cream
You take a guess
Where I stand oh pick a number
One to two
Then take a look
Back of your hand
Just like you know it
You know me too
Yeah like you know it
You know me too
Just like you know it
You know me too <start> Well you've gotta walk that lonesome valley yes you've gotta go there by yourself
Cause no one here is gonna go there with you yes you've gotta go there by yourself
Well if you can't speak like the angels if you can't preach like old Saint Paul
You can tell the love of Jesus yes you can say that he died for all
Yes you've gotta walk...
 dobro 
Many loved ones away up yonder just awaitin' on the golden shore
Let's prepare to go and meet them where sad parties will come no more
Well you've gotta walk...
Yes you've gotta walk... <start> Did you ever say I'm lonesome then stop to wonder really what lonesome is
Lonesome is a little boy lost in a crowd a telephone ringing in an empty house
Lonesome is an autumn leave that first falls from its tree lonesome is me
Lonesome is a footstep with no place to go
Or summer's last robin in winter's first snow
Lonesome is a little dog lost out in the street lonesome is me
Lonesome is an empty bottle a half filled glass of wine
The sound that clock makes when all you have is time
Lonesome is a heart that breaks when love has turned to hate
The dying sun at the close of day
Lonesome is a jail of tears that won't set me free lonesome is me
Lonesome is me lonesome is me <start> 
With all of my heart I know I could love you
But with all of my soul I'm driftin away
With all of my mind I know you could save me from myself
And anything else
With all of my strength I wanna reach out for you
With every breath I call out your name
With every step I just wanna turn around and say
Baby make it okay
But I'm so afraid that you've forgiven me one too many times
And I'm so afraid to give my heart again just to have a change of mind
And I'm not quite sure that you can trust me
And I would hate to have you find me again
Baby like the wind driftin away
It blows and nobody knows where it's going to

It blows and nobody know what it's gonna do
With all of my heart I know I disappointed you
And although I'm real sorry
I don't know how to save this time
But if I would lose you
I know I would go completely out of my mind
I'm running out of time
And I'm so afraid that you've forgiven me one too many times
And I'm so afraid to give my heart again just to have a change of mind
And I'm not quite sure that you can trust me
And I would hate to have you find me again
Baby like the wind driftin away
It blow and nobody knows where it's going to

It blows and nobody knows what it's gonna do

At night you can hear it cry as the tear drops fall from heaven's eyes

And somehow you know it's true these tears that fall are fallin for you

It blows and nobody knows where's it going to

It blows and nobody knows what it's gonna do
At night you can hear it cry as the tear drops fall from heaven's eyes
And somehow you know it's true these tears that fall are for you <start> I have felt it
And I have held it
I have known
A woman's love
I have tasted
And I have wasted
A woman's love
And I know
I'll never understand
All the little things
that make It grand
A woman's love
And I know
I'll never come Face to face
With any thing
that takes the Place
Of a woman's love
Well I have kiss it
Tried to resist it
I have missed
A woman's love
And I have hated
Taken for granted
A woman's love
Well I have needed
And I have pleaded
And I have lost
A woman's love
And I have worshipped
And I have cursed it
A woman's love
Well I adore it
Thank god for it
A woman's love <start> I bless the day I found you
I want my arms around you
And so I beg you let it be me
Don't take this Heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love what would life be
So never leave me lonely
Tell me that you love me only
And say you'll always let it be me <start> Sister's comin' home
Mama gonna let her sleep the whole day long
The whole day long
Sister's comin' home
Mama gonna let her sleep the whole day long
Sister's comin' home
Mama don't like the man that done her wrong
That done her wrong
Sister's coming home
Mama don't like the man that done her wrong
Down at the local beer joint
Dancin' to the rock' n' roll
Sister's like to do it Lord
Sister's like to move her soul
Down at the local beer joint
Dancin' on the hardwood floor
Her jeans fit a little bit tighter
Than they did before
Than they did before
Her jeans fit a little bit tighter
Than they did before
She likes to move her soul
She likes to move her soul
Sister likes to do it Lord
Sister likes to move her soul
Sister's comin' home
Mama don't like the man that done her wrong
That done her wrong
Sister's coming home
Mama don't like the man that done her wrong
And the mirror's gonna tell her
How long she's been gone
Sister's comin' home <start> Hey little bluebird how are you
Is it fun to fly in a sky of blue
Is it fun to sit and keep an eye on me
As much as I enjoy to watch you in the summer breeze
Hey little bluebird why do you stay
Through all the months of winter and all the snowy days
Why don 't you fly where the sun is warm for you
When it's cold outside what do you do
Chorus Where have you been
Where do you go
Flying in the sun
Flying in the snow
You're so lovely and I'm glad you're here
My little bluebird
Hey little bluebird on my window sill
When the sky is grey how do you feel
Are you lonely do you sing a little song
Do you ever cry when you're alone
How high can you fly Do you ever lose your way
Where do you hide when you're afraid
Does your little heart ever break like mine
Do you have a friend you think about at night
Chorus <start> You've got a one way ticket into my heart
You've got a one way ticket into my heart
I won't be the one you won't keep
I won't be your fool
I don't bite the lips that kiss me like you do
You say you've got something
That makes you unique
I can tell you I got something
Every little boy needs
You've got a one way ticket into my heart
You've got a one way ticket into my heart
You won't be some dream I'm dreamin'
I'll be wide awake
If I closed my eyes I'd miss it and what a waste
You won't get the better of me I'm the best
If you need a vacation I could do with a rest
You've got a one way ticket into my heart
You've got a one way ticket into my heart
Say you'll be mine all mine all mine
Don't hesitate don't wait it's too late
Just give your heart a break
Be mine be mine
You've got a one way ticket into my heart
You've got a one way ticket into my heart
Hearts of gold are hearts to mould
So come and work on me
I understand that underdstanding's hard to be
I want an angle to straighten me out
Got a secret I'm keepin'
Keepin' ya shouting about it
You've got a one way ticket into my heart
You've got a one way ticket into my heart <start> Your life laid down crucified.
Your arms stretched out and open wide.
To rescue me so I can be a child of God.
From nail pierced hands and thorn pierced brow
Your blood flows down to me somehow.
It cleanses me so I can be a child of God.
Praise to the lamb that was slain
Praise to the Father who gave His son away
The proof of love the price of grace
You traded all to take my place
And died for me so I can be a child of God <start> Well the two new people that's moved to the middle of the block
And we're at the top of the town and don't you think we're not
Well we found love and happiness people envy us you see
For we found heaven right here on earth at 
Yes we found what most people are looking for
And it's not a lotta money to spend on real fine car
But it's so when and where a bird flies and sings so free
And there's whole lotta winds in this little house at 
Four thousandth block proves what true love can do
Once a lonely place but was sold to me and you
Oh all around the house you can see little children play
But they're not as a people's kids were proud to say
They are the symbol of our love for all the world to see
They're a part of heaven right here on earth at 
 steel  el.banjo 
Our love's on the day you can see many people drive by
For look at the house they think there from the sky
They think this place would make them as happy as you and me
And the whole town's tryin' to buy our house at 
Four thousandth block proves what true love can do...
And we're not gonna sale our happy little house at 
Wouldn't take a pretty thing for the love we had at  <start> I like sugar and I like tea
but I don't like niggers no sire
there's two lone things that'll make me puke
that's a hog eatin' slop and a big black spook
You know it 'cuz I show it
like a barnyard rooster I crow it
an' the NAACP would sure like to get
a hold of nigger hatin' me.
Roses are red an' violets are blue an'
niggers are black you know that's true
but they don't mind 'cuz what the heck
you gotta' be black to get a welfare check.
..an' I'm broke no joke. I ain't got a nickle
for a coke and I ain't black you see so Uncle
Sam won't help poor nigger hatin' me.
Jiggaboo Jiggaboo where are you I was
here on the woodpile watching you. Jiggaboo
Jiggaboo come outdoors. No I'sa scared of the
white man way down south.
You know it 'cuz I show it. Stick your black
head out an' I'll blow it and the NAACP can't keep
you away from 'lil 'ol nigger hatin' me.
Mirror mirror on the wall who is the blackest
of them all A man named King it ain't no doubt
and he's causin' lots of trouble with his baboon
mouth. The ruin he's a doin' is caused by the
trouble he's a brewin' and the NAACP can't win if
the white man stick with nigger hatin' me.
Hey Mr. President whattayasay When are we
whites gonna have our day The niggers' had
theirs such a long long time. I'm a white an'
it's time that I have mine.
You know it 'cuz I show it. Stick your black head
out an' I'll blow it and the NAACP can't win if the
white man stick with nigger hatin' me.
Nigger hatin me' x <start> 
I wandered so aimless life filled sin
I wouldn't let my dear saviour in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light
Just like a blind man I wandered along
Worries and fears I claimed for my home
Then like a blind man God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light
I was a fool to wander and stray
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light
Praise the Lord I saw the light <start> Time can make lonely a fools paradise
Thought I was in heaven alone every night
Before I met you I was perfect
Perfectly Blue
Change doesnt come easy for the good or the bad
Honey youre the best thing that Ive ever had
Before I met you I was perfect
Perfectly blue
I used to cry out in the sun
To the dark side of a love I was accustomed
Then you came along
And turned my whole world
Upside down upside down
Im lost in your sweet love aint cried for days
Its so hard to be lonesome with a smile on my face
Before I met you I was perfect
Perfectly blue
Chorus
Oh before I met you I was perfect
Perfectly blue <start> The air in here smells like piss and beer
The sweet cycle of life Georgie E would say.
Thirteen grandchildren gathered around
Looking down into the ground.
A slow descent into darkness
I deserve no less
His last words carried like an offering
Upon his dying breath.
The sweet sweet cycle of you and I.
The sweet sweet memories of you and me
And the way we used to be.
I live like in a dream among the ruins
Of what has been.
The slow descent into madness
The churning swell of love and chaos
What was once at hand was now
Forbade to touch.
The sweet sweet cycle of you and I.
The sweet sweet memories of you and me
And the way we used to be.
Annie won't you sit and have another drink with me
I'll keep them waiting while you sip your tea.
Annie won't you sit and list them one more time
The reasons why I failed to to keep you mine
Regret is for your those with choices
Those will voices
Those with reasons to stick around.
So cast me deep into those black depths
With the reassurance that Death gets
The sonsofbitches too.

The sweet sweet cycle of you and I.
The sweet sweet cycle of you and me.
The sweet sweet cycle of you and I.
The sweet sweet memories of you and me
And the way we used to be
When we were free
How I long to be. <start> I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen
I left the country for the city
Thought I was smart but I was silly
I should've known I'd get in trouble being so green
I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen
I met a boy and learned to love him
I would have done anything for him
I loved him more than anything I've ever seen
I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen
Only eighteen but it's all over
I ruined my life to please my lover
I made him happy he made me cry
Then said goodbye
I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen
Only eighteen but it's all over
I ruined my life to please my lover
I made him happy he made me cry
Then said goodbye <start> I rode off into the sunset
The way cowboys always do
But ten miles west of Fort Worth
My thoughts ran back to you
I could feel you there beside me
Taste your tender lips on mine
Hey there'll always be another bronc
But true love is hard to find
CHORUS
Last night I found a soft place to fall
Loving arms to ease me down
To a big old feather bed
Instead of cold hard ground
I still love the rodeo
But with you I can have it all
'Cause last night I found
A soft place to fall
I've run wilder than the horses
That I set out to ride
My freedom was the one thing
I fought for all my life
But something in your gentle touch
Took the flight right out of me
I thought love was meant to be tied down
But I've never felt so free
CHORUS <start> With the world in the palm of his hands
Slipping through his fingers just like grains of sand
He don't know his hourglass is losing time
Till she run out of patience and leaves him far behind
Chorus
Some lovers gotta learn love the hard way
Before they understand the way they feel
Some lovers are slower than others
Some will come around and some never will
If only she had a dime every time he's done her wrong
Or for every one wondering why she's still holding on
She could buy that rodeo and shut it down
Along with every honky tonkin' bar in town
Chorus
Some lovers gotta learn love the hard way
Before they understand the way they feel
Some lovers are slower than others
Some will come around and some never will
It may be his fault but she's still one to blame
For taking him back and playing his foolish games
Chorus
Some lovers gotta learn love the hard way
Before they understand the way they feel
Some lovers are slower than others
Some will come around and some never will <start> Girl you melt me like ice and whiskey
With those blue fling looks that you give me
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killing me right now to see
You wanna slip off with me again
Why should we go round and round the truth
Like we been doin'
Every time we lie girl we're losing
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull and all nighter chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters 
Get a little higher 
Sippin' on fire
You act like you don't know what you're missing
Every time you end up back with him
'Cause it's safe and you're scared.
Of everything you're feeling when
We're burning the midnight down again
Why should we go round and round the truth like we been doin
Every time we lie girl we're losing
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull and all nighter chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters 
Get a little higher 
Sippin' on fire
Every goodbye is bitter sweet
So why should we fight what we both need
Why should we go round and round the truth like we been doin
Every time we lie girl we're losing
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull and all nighter chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters 
Get a little higher 
Sippin' on fire
Girl you melt me like ice and whiskey
With those blue fling looks that you give me
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killing me right now to see
You wanna slip off with me <start> I couldn't believe it the day that you left
Cleaned out your closet cleared off your shelves
Loaded your car and you drove out of sight
But I never said goodbye
I'll never say goodbye
The door's always open I leave on a light
I'm always waiting in case you drop by
I'll never say goodbye
People have told me you have a new love
My heart's not willing to give up on us
I've convinced myself they're just telling me lies
And I'll never say goodbye
I'll never say goodbye
The door's always open I leave on a light
I never wanted you out of my life
And I'll never say goodbye
I'll never say goodbye
The door's always open I leave on a light
I'll be loving you till the day that I die
And I'll never say goodbye
If you'll just come back I won't even ask why
I'll never say goodbye no I'll never say goodbye <start> Ever since the day he took your love from me
I've always said the time would set me free
But it seems that I can find no peace of mind
And I find I'm crying almost all the time
Almost all the time I tell myself I must forget
Almost all the time and oh how I've tried but haven't yet
 steel 
I break down each time I see you on the street
Inside it hurts each time that you don't see
You don't miss me I don't ever cross your mind
But darling I miss you all the time
Almost all the time... <start> 
Darling do you talk to Irving when you're here alone
What are all these calls to Irvine on the telephone
Just then that phone rang as I picked it up I knew
I handed it to her and said It's Irving dear for you
I'd stolen her away from Irving many years before
But she still dreams of Irving she wants Irving more and more
It's Irving over breakfast Irving through the day
Even when we're making love
There's Irving in the way
She's got Irving inside her and Irving won't come out
Though there's nothing about Irving to write home about
When I hold her and we kiss
It's Irving that and Irving this
Her sixletter word for bliss is Irving
She does not feel strongly about Ogden or Eugene
Norman Austin Gary Jackson Hannibal or Dean
Rochester Pierre Orlando Sherman Grant or Lee
Marlin Milton Bradley Homer Troy St. Paul or me
Every night I wail and weep
She mumbles Iirngg in her sleep
How'd it get in her so deep this Irving
I've always thought that Irving was featureless and bland
But Irving has a hold on her that I can't understand
They'll always be together even when they're miles apart
She's got IRVING tatooed on her heart
She's got Irving inside her and Irving's there to stay
Irving Irving Irving Irving's all that she would say
Though my heart was broken
I heard the word she'd spoken
I bought her a bus token back to Irving
The bus was silver I was blue
As I bid my love adieu
And I sadly sent her back to Irving <start> Well I hear that old John Deere tractor
At the low water bridge
Pulling the young drinkers across
He's dragging so many on this Saturday night
I can smell that old tractor's exhaust
But the rain on the roof sounds so pretty
And the cowboys are fearful the most
But Deena done broke from his ragged old pen
It's making a run for the coast
Well there's a place down on Main Street
Right across from the bank
Somebody drew one on the line
About twenty foot up on that Frontier Hotel
Where crested back in twentynine
Well this city took most of this little old town
'Cause we live on what they call the flame
Well I read all about it in the cafe downtown
Where they got that old newspaper frame
But the rain on the roof sounds so pretty
The cowboys are fearful the most
But Deena done broke from his ragged old pen
It's making a run for the coast
My grandmother called about ten minutes ago
Like she does almost every night
She said they come home way early from the old rodeo
When a big boat had knocked off the lights
Well she said a cowboy got buckin'
Just before it went dark
On a boat that they called 'Chequered Tree'
And ain't nobody's saw if he finished his ride
So I guess I'll forget about sleep
But the rain on the roof sounds so pretty
And the cowboys are fearful the most
But Deena done broke from his ragged old pen
It's making a run for the coast
But Deena done broke from his ragged old pen
It's making a run for the coast <start> Don't choose me because I am faithful.
Don't choose me because I am kind.
If your heart settles on me I'm for the taking.
Take me for longing or leave me behind.
I would be for you a fire in a rainbow
I would be for you an opening door.
Time and hard lessons are one kind of wisdom.
Try to forget them or love me no more.
I'm not asking your heart to believe me.
I'm not asking for promise or pledge.
Whatever the answer it's yes that's the question.
I am the fool dancin' over the edge.
Don't choose me because I am faithful.
Don't choose me because I am kind.
If your heart settles on me I'm for the taking.
Take me for longing or leave me behind. <start> Yeah this place is wall to wall can't barely move takes fifteen minutes just to get a drink
It's crazy here this crowd tonight's so loud in here you can hardly think
But everything's fading babe cause you're all I see
It's like we're alone in here baby
We might as well be on an island we might as well be on the moon
The way you're looking at me baby can't take my eyes off you
Feels like the world is disappearing every time we touch
We're so caught up in each other it's just the two of us
We might as well be on an island we might as well be on an island
It's just me and you back corner booth we're sitting on the same seat
Got my hands all over you and yeah girl you're all over me
Like nobody's watching us baby let them all see
Still that ain't stopping us baby
We might as well be on an island we might as well be on the moon
The way you're looking at me baby can't take my eyes off you
Feels like the world is disappearing every time we touch
We're so caught up in each other it's just the two of us
We might as well be on an island we might as well be on an island
We might as well be on an island
Like we're the last two on this Earth
Like we're frozen here in time
Like it's empty here tonight
We might as well be on an island we might as well be on the moon
The way you're looking at me baby can't take my eyes off you
Feels like the world is disappearing every time we touch
We're so caught up in each other it's just the two of us
We might as well be on an island we might as well be on an island yeah <start> In old Mexico I stand on the square in Matamoros
Round a Plazza the couples were walking to music so sweet
I've found my love not too long ago in Matamoros
But I'm feeling low as the beggar who sits in the street
All the promises that she made me with eyes black as midnight
How could I know how fickle her promise would be
Now I'm back to find for I feel is mine in Matamoros
And there'll be bad trouble if I catch her cheating on me
Streets're narrow and dark and tequilla runs free in Matamoros
I stopped for one moment outside at Maguel's swinging doors
My heart breaks to hear the same haunting sounds of Granada
She once called it our song and vowed should be mine evermore
Then across the square went this wild young bracero I see her
Laughing and dancing and tossing her raven black hair
They'd may take a hand when I face this man from Matamoros
For the love of my woman is one thing that I'll never share
 guitar 
Now I walk in the night far away from the lights of Matamoros
And recall the last moments when I knew she loved me more than life
I can still hear her cry I love you and I'll prove it Manana
Then seeing my danger she jumped in front of his knife
I know the stories they'll tell in dimly casinos
Of the raven haired beauty who for her love laid dead on the floor
They'll speak of the fight with the gringo that night in Matamoros
And wonder what happened for he never returned anymore oh oh hoo <start> 
I'm only human
You look so good to me
I want to love you
But I'm not sure I can
I'm gettin' over a man
I'm bein' careful
Just goin' easy
And putting my life in to order
I'm makin' new plans
I'm gettin' over a man
Don't bring me no flowers
Don't call me back in an hour
I'm not home
I'm not ready for somebody new
Not even you
It's a little too soon
I'm gettin' over a man
You're so good lookin'
You're really temptin' me
It's been too long since somebody gave a damn
Since I wanted a man
I'm gettin' nervous
I see you comin'
And I ought to get up and grab you
But please understand
I'm gettin' over a man <start> 
Someone else will be kissing you but you'll still be in my heart
Don't forget I still love you when her arms hold you tight
Just remember that I still care though I'm not with you tonight
When I told you I love you I promised I'd be true
And I'll keep that promise my whole life through
I could never forget you and how our love used to be
Goodbye my darling and don't forget you can always come back to me
I could never forget you <start> I feel terrible sunlight's hurting my eyes
So I pull the shades and I make my place as black as night
I feel miserable and I'm missing you and me
Another Sunday morning all alone underneath these sheets
No I'm not hungover it's true but I'm still not over you
All messed up all strung out I was sitting at home breaking down
I'm not out there getting high underneath some neon lights
Ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right
I'm just getting over another sober Saturday night
Besides the pain I don't feel a thing
When my buddies call me up I just let it ring
No I'm not hungover it's true but I'm still not over you
All messed up all strung out I was sitting at home breaking down
I'm not out there getting high underneath some neon lights
Ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right
I'm just getting over another sober Saturday night <start> I never told her the what not to do's I'm just not tyin' down kind
I've thought I could hold her much closer to me by giving her freedom a mind
I figured someday that she would outgrow her flare for the flirtin' and flinging
I finally gave her enough rope to hang her and she's still out there swinging
I never tried into the where's and the why's no matter what time she came in
While I thought she was out playin' bridge with the girls
She was out playin' games with the men
Too late I discovered she had too much slack like a fool to a dream I'm still clinging
I finally gave her enough rope to hang her and she's still out there swinging
 guitar 
Now here I sit with the why do I do's while she's running round wild and free
I tried to give her a mind of her own but she couldn't keep it on me
Now just like a fool I still sit here at home and wait by a phone that's my bringing
I finally gave her enough rope to hang her and she's still out there swinging
I finally gave her enough rope to hang her and she's still out there swinging <start> As I slide the key in the ignition of this ol' truck and fire it up
I'm struck hard by the heaviness of this situation
My eyes are fixed on the small silver half heart key chain you gave me
Dangling in the dashboard light
I read the word forever over and over again I wanna cry
I turn off my radio as I turn off your county road
To pick you up just like I've done at least a thousand times
The gravel underneath these tires
Half mile stretch of ol' barbed wire Drops of rain fallin' from the sky seem to know my pain
Know that I'm about to reach out to hold your hand in mine
Feel your love baby one more time
Press against your lips and hold you tight I know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye
I could put it off for another day act like everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna break my heart to see you cry
I know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye
See it's not that what I got to do is more important than you
It's just what I gotta do
And I know you don't understand hell I don't understand myself
As I pull up to your house I feel my head spinnin' around
Just thinkin' about How everything is about to change
Every step I take towards your door I'm a little less certain than the step before
Oh but I know I know I know what I gotta do
I got to reach out and hold your hand in mine feel your love baby one more time
Press against your lips and hold you tight I know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye
I could put it off for another day act like everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna break my heart to see you cry
I know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye
Reach out and hold your hand in mine feel your love baby one more time
Press against your lips and hold you tight
Yeah I could put it off for another day and act like everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna break my heart to see you cry
I know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye
Goodbye <start> I want to feel this way
Longer than time
I want to know your dreams
And make them mine
I want to change the world
Only for you
All the impossible
I want to do
I want to hold you close under the rain
I want to kiss your smile
And feel your pain
I know what's beautiful
Looking at you
Here in a world of lies
You are the true
Chorus
And baby
Everytime you touch me
I become a hero
I'll make you safe no matter where you are
And bring you
Anything you ask for
Nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me
I want to make you see
Just what i was
Show you the loneliness
And what it does
You walked into my life
To stop my tears
Everything's easy now
I have you here
Repeat chorus
In a world without you
I would always hunger
All i need is your love to make me stronger
Repeat chorus <start> Love's Endless War
Don Williams
LOVE'S ENDLESS WAR
Hearts have been broken
in the game of true love
I'm afraid to surrender
I'm not strong enough
Give it all away
open up every door
My heart is a castle in love's endless war
Dreams can betray you
When you're far out that sea
Many proud hearts have foundered
on love's mutiny
Give it all away
Be a young fool once more
My heart is an island adrift from your shore
in love's endless war <start> I dreamed last night that I was walking with somebody new
I turn the corner and of course I run right into you
I let go of that woman and I reached out for your hand
You walked by as if you could not give a good goddamn
That's me that's you
And it's so easy to see what's true
When I close my eyes at night 'cause dreams don't lie
When I close my eyes at night 'cause dreams don't lie
I have this little fantasy that it would be good
To be livin' on my own then you know I could
Just go out to the bars and try to meet somebody new
But when I do I end up with someone just like you
That's me well that's you
And it's so easy to see what's true
When I close my eyes at night 'cause dreams don't lie
I try to run away but you know I'll always stay
'Cause when I go to sleep at night these dreams don't lie
When I close my eyes at night these dreams don't lie
And you know I think that I just cannot trust my heart
And you know how thinkin' is it's hard to stop it when it starts
Last night we were standing there children gathered round
Suddenly I was ten feet up off the ground
And you looked up to see me floatin' grabbed me by the arm
You pulled me back down to the ground keepin' me from harm
That's me and that's you
It's so easy to see what's true
When I close my eyes at night 'cause dreams don't lie
I try to run away but you know I'll always stay
'Cause when I go to sleep at night these dreams don't lie
When I go to sleep at night these dreams don't lie
Well I'm counting all my lucky stars that dreams don't lie <start> There never was anyone quite like me
I'm the only me that you'll ever see
From the top of my head to the tip of my toe
Oh oh oh I'm special you know

There never was anyone like me or you
Being ourselves is the best we can do
We're priceless and precious for God tells me so
Oh oh oh we're special you know

CHORUS
We're quite unique a walking work of art
And strong or weak we all have our own special place in God's heart

We're different each one from the other it's true
God never repeats himself never makes two
Be happy with who you are God made you so
Oh oh oh you're special you know

REPEAT CHORUS
We're different each one from the other it's true
God never repeats himself never makes two
Be happy with who you are God made you so
Oh oh oh you're special you know <start> 
In my mind I've made love to you often
But only in my mind can it be so
'Cause there's someone at home that's countin' on me
And if I did I'm sure that he would know
Yes he would know yes he could tell
For he has loved me long enough to know me very well
And if I lied he'd see it in my eyes
I know my guilt would show and he would know
But I must admit you're someone very special
And it would be so easy to let go
Makin' love to you could be so easy
But if I did I'm sure that he would know
Yes he would know yes he could tell
For he has loved me long enough to know me very well
And if I lied he'd see it in my eyes
I know my guilt would show and he would know
My conscience just won't let me make love to you
I know it would be sweet but I just can't
When I go home to him I must be able
To look him in the eyes and say I ain't
'Cause he would know yes he could tell
For he has loved me long enough to know me very well
And if I lied he'd see it in my eyes
I know my guilt would show and he would know
He would know <start> I had to look through our old pictures
To see the way we used to smile
Before we left love in the closet
Like it just went out of style
Can we pull out those old feelin's
Wipe the hurt away like dust
Make love shine the way it used to shine
Find the gold beneath the rust
That's all I need to know
Do you want to stay together
Just say let's don't let go
And I'll keep holdin' on forever
Have the teardrops that you've cried
Drowned the fire in your eyes
Is there one flame beneath the smoke
Tell me is there any hope
That's all I need to know
Is it too late to recover
Those old smiles we used to wear
Can we save a love that once was strong
Before it breaks beyond repair <start> Won't you scratch my itch sweet Annie Rich
And welcome me back to town
Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlour
And I'll show you how it all went down
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
Oh and I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down down down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
'Cause I headed West to grow up with the country
Across those prairies with those waves of grain
And I saw my devil and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee
We flew straight across that river bridge last night half past two
The switchman wave his lantern goodbye and good day as we went roling through
Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel
And now I know just what I have to do 
And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something that I've never been shown
And I saw my devil and I saw my deep blue see
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee
The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt
And lighted out for some desert town
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
Oh but I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down down down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
Twenty thousand roads I went down down down
And they all lead me straight back home to you <start> 
Why would I want another when the very best is you
There's so many out there cheatin' but you know I like bein' true
They're all searchin' for somethin' that I've already found in you
With all the love you've given it's so easy to be true
Why would I want another when the very best is you
Every time I look at you love is all I see
Baby you're the greatest thing that's happened to me
You're all that I could ever want it's easy to be true
Why would I want another when the very best is you

You're all that I could ever want it's easy to be true
Why would I want another when the very best is you
When the very best is you <start> Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing power
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb
Are you fully trusting in His grace this hour
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb
Are you washed in the blood
In the soulcleansing blood of the Lamb
Are your garments spotless are they white as snow
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb
Lay aside your garments that are stained with sin
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb.
There's a fountain flowing for the soul unclean.
O be washed in the blood of the Lamb
Are you washed in the blood
In the soulcleansing blood of the Lamb
Are your garments spotless are they white as snow
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb <start> I was there in my trailer
Down at the job site
The day that this stranger walked in
His face looked so sad and he carried a set of blueprints
And as I unrolled them the first thing I noticed
Was there were no doors in the plans
He said if you build this for me
Then when she comes back
She'll never be able to leave me again
Chorus
I said if I did
And she ever came back
Friend tell me how would she get in
It would just be a prison that I locked you in
If you couldn't leave
You'd never know if there was someone to love you
The way that she didn't before
There's two things that I know for sure
It's that you can't make a women feel something she don't
And you can't build a house with no doors
Awhile he was quiet I could tell he was thinking
I thought I just ruined his day
I just couldn't bear to see this man's last hope slip away
So I thought real fast and I started talking
Said Buddy we tried this before
And if there ain't one she'll make one
Either way she'll run
And leave you a house with a hole for a door
Chorus <start> See the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it was just a twig
And then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came running in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her
When I came home from working late 'cause I would know
That she'd been there a crying
Over some sad and silly late late show
And honey I miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad
So afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me and hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly
Found her crying needlessly in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and Robins sing she went away
And honey I miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could
Yes one day while I was not at home
While she was there and all alone the angels came
Now all I have is memories
Of honey and I wake up nights and call her name
And now my life's an empty stage
Where honey lived and honey played and love grew up
A small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed that honey loved
Yes see the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it was just a twig
And honey I miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could <start> Walking out on me must be the way
You show me how it feels to be her
I realize the fault is mine
I'm getting everything that I deserve
It's over and older the tears seem much colder
Sunshiny days seem to be so blue
It's over and older the tears seem much colder
Each passing day I wish I still had you
My troubles would be all over now
If I could only get you off my mind
And I would give a fortune now
If I could only hold you one more time
It's over and older the tears seem much colder
Sunshiny days seem to be so blue
It's over and older the tears seem much colder
Each passing day I wish I still had you
It's over and older the tears seem much colder
Sunshiny days seem to be so blue
It's over and older the tears seem much colder
Each passing day I wish I still had you
It's over and older the tears seem much colder
Sunshiny days seem to be so blue
It's over and older the tears seem much colder
Each passing day I wish I still had you
Each passing day I wish I still had you <start> I was standing in the yard watching you go
You only been gone about an hour or so
I'm already wondering what I'll do
All by myself without you
Then it hit me like a lightning crash
I'm gonna sit here and cry until you come back
Better tell the boss I can't come in
At least not until you love me again
Mommy's gonna get a little bit tired
But it's okay it's alright
It don't take a whole lot of cash
To sit here and cry 'til you come back
Sit here alone wondering why
Counting every tear that I can cry
Broke down train on a oneway track
Gonna sit here and cry 'til you come back
Well I guess I didn't really think this through
But I'll lose my mind when it comes to you
Been out here every night and day
Waiting on the blues to go away
But I just think they're gonna turn black
Gonna sit here and cry 'til you come back
Sit here alone wondering why
Counting every tear that I can cry
Broke down train on a oneway track
Gonna sit here and cry 'til you come back
Feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack
Gonna sit here and cry 'til you come back
Sit here and cry 'til you come back
Sit here and cry 'til you come back <start> The what

He woke up on a cold floor
In a motel on the south side of nowhere and he swore
That this is the last time
Like the last time before
Just like the last time before

But the wheels keep turning 'round
The engines they never slow down
And he knew that these tracks would lead to heartache and pain
But he still got on that train

Theres a girl down in Georgia
Broken homecoming queen knocked around black and blue
Said this is the last time
This time I know that we're through
Oh this time I swear that we're through

But the wheels keep turning 'round
The engines they never slow down
And she knew that these tracks would lead to heartache and pain
But she still got on that train

I wake up in a cold bed
Playing shows every night on this long lonely road
I'm thinking of you
And I just wanna come home
Oh but I'm just too far from home

But the wheels keep turning 'round
The engines they never slow down
And I knew that these tracks would lead to heartache and pain
But I still got on that train
And I knew that these tracks would lead to heartache and pain
But I still got on that train
Got on that train.... <start> I tried to love you baby
But I couldn't make you happy
And it just really shouldn't be so hard
I gave and you kept taking
You made some big mistakes and
You were always careless with my heart
Chorus
I'm happier now
Ain't it funny how
All it took was leaving you
To finally feel good again
You say you're sorry now
That you figured out
Just what it was that you had to lose
Well it sucks to be you
You used your last chance so
I went and found romance oh
Your eally just can't stand it can you
You see the smile on my face
And it really drives you crazy
Just to see how much better off I am without you
Chorus
I'm happier now
Ain't it funny how
All it took was leaving you
To finally feel good again
You say you're sorry now
That you figured out
Just what it was that you had to lose
Well it sucks to be you
Don't worry baby
I'm sure you'll find someone too
Yeah who'll put up with you
Chorus
I'm happier now
Ain't it funny how
All it took was leaving you
To finally feel good again
You say you're sorry now
That you figured out
Just what it was that you had to lose
Well it sucks to be you
Chorus
I'm happier now
Ain't it funny how
All it took was leaving you
To finally feel good again
You say you're sorry now
That you figured out
Just what it was that you had to lose
Well it sucks to be you
I'm gone <start> When the letter came this morning
Happy teardrops filled my eyes
It had a picture of a smiling face
And a ticket tucked inside
He didn't have to write one word
I understood it all
The picture said I love you
And the ticket said Come home
Well the big ole wheels
Are turning as we roll on down the line
Hey there big conductor
Won't you get me there on time
The Kudzu vines are winding
Up the trees beside the road
The grass is getting greener
So we must be getting close
There he stands awaiting
As the train pulls to the gate
There's so many things to ask him
But they're gonna have to wait
With cap in hand he stands there
Every hair is combed in place
His shiny boots reflecting
The big smile on his face
Lonely hearts club tell me
Why do they call you lonely
You've made me happier
Than I've ever been
For the price of a letter
And one old faded picture
You've helped me
Find myself to love a man
Arm in arm he leads me
To his buckboard by the tree
Hand in hand we ride
To the house he built for me
He picks me up and gently
Carries me through the cabin door
Goodbye lonely hearts club
I don't need you anymore
Lonely hearts club tell me
Why do they call you lonely
You've made me happier
Than I've ever been
For the price of a letter
And one old faded picture
You've helped me
Find myself to love a man
Lonely hearts club tell me
Why do they call you lonely
You've made me happier

Hey hey hey carry me home <start> You don't dress up in satin
You don't wear diamond rings
But I'm satisfied with you.
You look just like an angel but you haven't got wings
But I'm satisfied with you.
I'd rather have you just the way that you are
Than change you for somebody new.
Maybe I could do better if I reached for a star
But I'm satisfied with you.
You're not made out of candy
But you're as sweet as you can be
So I'm satisfied with you.
I just can't see no reason why you bother with me
But I'm satisfied with you.
I often wonder if it's all a mistake
It's hard to believe that it's true.
But If I'm only dreaming I sure don't want to wake
'Cause I'm satisfied with you. <start> Yeah they oughta make a brand new whiskey

When a goodbye hits him like a hurricane
Make it sweet as sweet as her lips
Something special like champagne
Yeah they oughta make a brand new whiskey
And give it a woman's name
Leaving's the reason I'm drinking
Oh I've never felt so alone
Night and day I stay stoned
Hoping to forget she's gone
I never thought she'd do me so dirty
Together forever she promised me
She took her promise and left a memory
The day the woman walked out on me
Yeah they oughta make a brand new whiskey
And give it a woman's name
A man needs something to hold onto
When a goodbye hits him like a hurricane
Make it sweet as sweet as her lips

My Daddy said I was broken
The beginning of the end
Of a life I hadn't chosen
He taught me how to give up
He taught me how to work the system
But I never had the time
I never had the luxury
Life's hard I've always known that
I've never been handed no welcome mat
When I die please don't cry
'Cause heaven's my home anyhow
Shining my shoes
Seems like time for wasting
'Cause this bright sun
Is the only shine I need
They say you only live once
And the lot you get's for keeping
But glory's gonna come
And make a new man out of me
Life's hard I've always known that
I've never been handed no welcome mat
When I die please don't cry
'Cause heaven's my home anyhow
When I was born
My face was like the angels
I took my father by the hand
He said life won't be hard now
No life's hard I've always known that
I've never been handed no welcome mat
When I die please don't cry
'Cause heaven's my home anyhow
Life's hard I've always known that
I've never been handed no welcome mat
When I die please don't cry

Our hearts are made of it let's take a chance why'd be afraid of it
Let's close our eyes and make our own paradise
Little we're knowin' still we can try to make a grow it
We might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be that our hearts discover
Let's fall in love why shouldn't we fall in love
Now it's a time for it while we are young let's fall in love <start> We were reckless wild and free
It was like a crazy dream
When I found my way to you
We both had so much to lose
We broke so many hearts
We tried to be apart
We wasted so much time
We even tried to say goodbye
Chorus You were not mine
But I took you anyway
From her side
And I caused her so much pain
I f I could change
Anything I've done
I'd just stay lonely even though my selfish heart has found a home
We cried so many tears in vain
We only had ourselves to blame
We lied to everyone
Now everything is said and done
Many restless nights ago
We tried to let it go
Things will never be the same
and no one knows the price we've paid <start> When peace like a river
Attendeth my way
When sorrows like sea billows roll
Whatever my lot
Thou has taught me to say
It is well it is well with my soul
It is well it is well with my soul
With my soul
It is well it is well with my soul
My sin oh the bliss
Of this glorious thought
My sin not in part but the whole
Is nailed to the cross
And I bear it no more
Praise the Lord praise the Lord
Oh my soul
It is well it is well with my soul
With my soul
It is well it is well with my soul
And Lord haste the day
When the faith shall be sight
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll
The trump shall resound
And the Lord shall descend
Even so it is well with my soul
It is well it is well with my soul
With my soul
It is well it is well with my soul
It is well it is well with my soul
With my soul
It is well it is well with my soul <start> What a friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and griefs to bear
And what a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer
Oh what peace we often forfeit
Oh what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer
Have we trials and temptations
Is there trouble anywhere
We should never be discouraged
Take it to the Lord in prayer
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share
Jesus knows our every weakness
Take it to the Lord in prayer <start> Lonesome number one
Just call me lonesome number one
Although no titles have I won
I surely must be lonesome number one
Every love I've had has faded like a dew
Everyone I wanted has wanted someone new
Heartaches hang around they always come
I surely must be lonesome number one
Lonesome number one
Seems I'm always losing love just can't come near
Just when love gets close it always disappears
Sorrow always keeps me on the run
I surely must be lonesome number one <start> I've been chasing you around
When I go up you're down
I'm tired of fooling around
Hope you're life is better now
You want to run from...
I can't give up on...
all of my dreams
Hope they don't leave me too
How long will it take
I already said I do
I liked myself with you
but you think it's worthless for whatever reasons
All of my friends
Hope they don't leave me too
How long will it take
for you
I have been here
and you've done what you want
Call if you want to
hide when you don't
I don't care
All of your dreams
Hope they don't leave you too
And when no one else sees
I see only you
How long will it take <start> Well I heard about it
That kind of need that keeps a person sleepless
All that dreaming just the same
And I read about it
I've just decide if someone leaves you breathless
But I never felt that way now I feel It
I'm not so sure I like it
But I feel it consume it be
And it's agony sweet agony
I ain't for you I beg for you to set me free
From this agony sweet agony
Oh what if I take control so easily
Sweet agony sweet agony sweet agony
If you had it planned out to give yourself halfway
And leave me wanting more right here on the brink
Well your time just ran out I've got to hide it all
What are you waiting for
I'm too afraid to think what this thing is
I'm not so sure I like it that expenses just killing me
And it's agony sweet agony
I ain't for you I beg for you to set me free
From this agony sweet agony
Oh what if I take control so easily
Sweet agony sweet agony sweet agony
I want the real thing tired of daydreams
And don't you tease me anymore
You've got the real thing to keep me waiting
I never felt like this before
And it's agony sweet agony
I ain't for you I beg for you to set me free
From this agony sweet agony
Oh what if I take control so easily
Sweet agony sweet agony
I ain't for you I beg for you to set me free
From this agony sweet agony
Oh what if I take control so easily
Oh it's agony sweet agony
I ain't for you <start> You can't be true dear there's nothing more to say
I trusted you dear hoping we find the way
Your kisses tell me that you and I are through
But I'll keep loving you although you can't be true
 steel 
You can't be true dear... <start> I washed it with water
Made it smell like rosemary
A funny little tearbox
A chest full of laughter
Well I drank hot coffee
Well I drank so much coffee
Now my hair it sticks up like the startled squirrels
It's always four in the morning
To understand all these containers
I'll imitate a mile
Walk with me for awhile
It dissapears like the tearbox
I'll imitate a mile
Walk with me for awhile
It dissapears like the tearbox <start> 
Busy signal
That's what I get when I call you
Busy busy
Talking to someone new
I wish I knew
I shouldn't worry 'cause it's probably his mother
Or then again it could even be his little brother
On the line
Making me lose my mind
Hang up hang up hang up hang up
Come on hang up hang up hang up
Gotta talk to my baby
Gotta tell him I'm sorry
Busy signal
How can I tell him I'm sorry
When I said I didn't care
I didn't mean a word I said
Talking outta my head
I've got to reach him now and tell him that I love him
And from now on I'll stay right by his side and love him
All the time
So please somebody quit tying up the line
Hang up hang up hang up hang up
Come on hang up hang up hang up
Gotta talk to my baby
Gotta tell him I'm sorry
I didn't mean to hurt you baby
I really really love you baby <start> She was looking at shoes on Amazon
Her papa bad said find anyone
She thought about the first boy that she loved
Just a couple clicks and there he was
That night she sent a friend request
The next day she sat down at her desk
And four simple words Hey how you been
And she felt seventeen again
Chorus
And that's the thing about Facebook friends
It doesn't matter how long it's been
Someone you never thought you'd ever see again
And suddenly you're Facebook friends
They started out just catching up
That led to meeting him for lunch
For long they're meeting in some bar
And for long they're kissing in some car
Chorus
Oh if there was anybody else
She be sittin' in judgement
Thinking they should be ashamed of themselves
For God's sakes you've got a husband and a minivan
And this was not part of a plan
She fantasized they'd start a new life
That he'd finally up and leave his wife
But one day she turned her laptop on
And his whole profile page was gone
And that's the thing about Facebook friends <start> The fisherman are pitching pennies in the sand beside the sea
And the sunrise hits their oilskin boots their painted boats and me
And they seem to know the ocean like a man knows a woman
She makes him wait around for half the morning for the tide to turn
Chorus
Pull on the ropes seine haul fisherman
Never catches more than he knows he can sell in a day
Pull in the nets seine haul fisherman
Day's for work night's the time to go dancing
They're drinking beer and laughing and squinting at the sun
Waiting for the gulls to tell them when the fish will come
Their faces brown and weathered from all the nets they've run
They've learned to wait they always know that the tide will turn
Chorus
Now way out on the ocean the big ships hunt for whales
And the Japanese have caught so many now they hunt for snails
But my fisherman's not greedy he seems content to live
With the sun and the sand and a net full of fishes when the tide turns
Chorus
Oh yes pull on the ropes seine haul fisherman
Never catches more than he knows he can sell in a day
Oh and pull in the nets seine haul fisherman
Day's for work night's the time to go dancing <start> They say there he sits in his big white wicker rocker
Eatin' candy coated cashews sippin' orange lemonade
While a sweet young thing fans the flies from off his eyebrows
He's dozin' in the green catalpa shade
Lord they say that Jesse Langtree's got it made
A little bit south of the Okechobee there's a story that the swamp folks tell
About a mean old man named Jesse Langtree
And a sweet young maid and a bottomless well
That water's cold but that don't matter how deep it is no one can tell
Just drop a stone you'll never hear it splatter
It just falls down down forever in the bottomless well
Through fifteen miles of snakes and gators
With the raging fever and the trembling chills
I wandered lost through the Okechobee
And there I seen 'em sittin' there by the bottomless well
Yeah now there he sits...

I asked her for a drink of water and as Jesse slept me and her we talked a spell
She said that she was his wife and daughter Lord Lord
But his heart was cold cold and dark as the bottomless well
And as he slept I bent to kiss her I heard a loud and jealous yell
Felt my head explode in darkness two big hairy arms picked me up
And dragged me to the bottomless well
I woke up in fear and trembling I was staring down into the jaws of hell
As he held me high above his shoulders
A gonna throw me down down down to the bottomless well
Now here I sit in Jesse's big white wicker rocker
Eatin' his candy coated cashews sippin' his orange lemonade
While that sweet young thing fans the flies from off my eyebrows
I'm dozin' in the green catalpa shade
Enjoying things that Jesse Langtree made oh God bless you Jesse
Now some folks say that sweet thing pushed him but I was there and I'd swear he fell
But it ain't murder cause he ain't dead cause he's still a fallin'
Goin' down down forever in the bottomless well
Goin' down down down down down bye Jesse <start> September skies bodies falling
Never again will you catch me admiring
Those vast September skies.
October skies hate is flying
Crimson leaves slowly falling
From azure October skies.
Chorus
Time to kill our children
And sing about it.
Let's all kill our children
And sing about it.
November skies heart is sinking.
No telling where they're leading
These grey November skies.
Chorus
December skies star will be rising.
Will we heed those lessons ringing
Through those dark December skies.
Chorus <start> My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
There's nothing I can think or do or say
To make this crazy dreaming go away
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
I wake up in the morning I go to sleep at night
Somewhere in between the two I swear Ill get it right
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
I'm wondering just how far my mind can stray
Just how wild is too high a price to pay
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
But are they wild enough to make you stay
Or does dreaming only make you stay away
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
My daydreams and my nightmares are so real there's no mistake
It wouldn't so bad if I was not so wide awake
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
There's nothing I can think or do or say
I only hope and pray Ill dream someday
Just one dream wild enough to make you Stay
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day <start> You got the last of all your stuff
You got your car cranked up
And I guess there ain't a thing that I can say
I'm thinking as I'm standing here
And suddenly it all comes clear
As I watch you drive away
They should have made tail lights blue
So when I see them go
They'll look the way I do
Just a pale blue glow
They should have made I can't stay
Sound like I love you
You know they should have made tail lights blue
I know it's gonna take some time
To get you off my mind
And forget how happy we once were
I don't know how to bring you back
And as a matter of fact
The only thing I know for sure
Is that they should have made tail lights blue
So when I see them go
They'll look the way I do
Just a pale blue glow
They should have made I can't stay
Sound like I love you
You know they should have made tail lights blue <start> Look at the two of you dancing that way
Lost in the moment and each other's face
So much in love you're alone in this place
Like there's nobody else in the world
I was enough for her not long ago
I was her number one she told me so
And she still means the world to me
Just so you know
So be careful when you hold my girl
Time changes everything life must go on
And I'm not gonna stand in your way
I loved her first
I held her first
And a place in my heart will always be hers
From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me
I knew the love of a father runs deep
And I prayed that she'd find you someday
But it's still hard to give her away
I loved her first
How could that beautiful woman with you
Be that same freckled face kid that I knew
The one that I read all those fairy tales to
And tucked into bed all those nights
And I knew the first time I saw you with her
It was only a matter of time
I loved her first
I held her first
And a place in my heart will always be hers
From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me
I knew the love of a father runs deep
And I prayed that she'd find you someday
But it's still hard to give her away
I loved her first
From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me
I knew the love of a father runs deep
Someday you might know what I'm going through
When a miracle smiles up at you
Yeah I loved her first <start> You place your hand on His Bible when you swear to tell the Truth
His name is on our greatest Monuments and all our money too
And when we Pledge allegiance there's no doubt where we stand
There is no separation we're one Nation under Him.
Chorus
In God We Still Trust
Here in America
He's the one we turn to every time
The goin' gets rough
He is the source of all our Strength
The One who watches over us
Here in America
In God We Still Trust
Now there are those among us who want to push Him out
And erase His name from everything this country's all about
From the Schoolhouse to the Courthouse they're Silencing His Word
Now it's time for all Believers to make our Voices heard.
In God We Still Trust
Here in America
He's the one we turn to every time
The goin' gets rough
He is the source of all our Strength
The One who watches over us
Here in America
In God We Still Trust
Here in America
Here in America
Here in America
In God We Still Trust
Here in America
In God We Still Trust
Here in America <start> My friends tried to tell me you were steppin' around
But I wouldn't hear it I shut them all down
But now I'm a thinkin' you've made a fool out of me
'Cause the words that are slippin' spell grief and misery
One more name one more name you call out in your sleep
One more name and I'll know it's not a lie
One more name one more name that from your lips does creep
One more name and our love will surely die
Haunted and tortured by the rumours about you
Listening in silence to whispers of truth
Deceived by the soft kiss you forge every day
While each night those same lips give your secret away
One more name one more name you call out in your sleep
One more name and I'll know it's not a lie
One more name one more name that from your lips does creep
One more name and our love will surely die <start> Last night he called from Dallas he was havin' a beer at the Crystal Palace
He said honey you won't be alone for long
I got to make just one more stop to pick up a ring in Little Rock
And I'm gonna head this semi straight for home
Fourteen wheels a whinin' four big headlights shinin'
Him and that semi been away too long
Hope he don't get stop from speedin' cause I've got everything he's needin'
Waitin' for him right here at home
He's got that big ole engine singin' singin' my favorite song
And I know he's headin' my way rollin' down the highway
Tonight my baby's comin' home
 guitar 
Ten thousand miles I've missed him it's been a week since I kissed him
And forty truckstops since I held him tight
A million chicks and he can get 'em they want to make love and he won't let 'em
The only thing he wants he'll get tonight
He's got that big ole engine singin'...
And I know he's headin' my way rollin' down the highway
Tonight my baby's comin' home
And I know he's headin' my way rollin' down the highway
Tonight my baby's comin' home <start> When I found you darling then he saw his big mistake
Saw what he was losin' felt his heart begin to break
Please don't let him talk you bout the way he's done before
Why he's had a hundred chances he don't deserve you anymore
Let his eyes do the crying let his feet walk the floor
Let his heart do the breaking like he's let yours break before
Let his lips do the sighing let his heartaches start to sore
Let his arms do the aching he don't deserve you anymore
 steel 
He took you for granted and he only brought you shame
It was never his intention to let you share his name
The lonely hours you've waited now won't happen anymore
For it's his turn to feel the hurt he don't deserve you anymore
Let his eyes do the crying... <start> She can take the morning rain
Falling on my window pane
And turn it into sunshine in my mind
And she can take the darkest night
And brighten it with a love sweet light
And I'm satisfied just knowing she's that kind
And I can feel so down and out
But she knows what it's all about
And she can help me leave it all behind
There's something in the way she smiles
That seems to brighten all my trials
It's good to know my woman is that kind
She's that kind that I'm thankful to the Lord above
For sending me that kind of woman for me to love
If I could live another life and I could choose another wife
I wouldn't change a thing 'cause she's that kind
She's that kind that I'm thankful to the Lord above
For sending me that kind of woman for me to love
If I could live another life and I could choose another wife
I wouldn't change a thing 'cause she's that kind
No I wouldn't change a thing 'cause she's that kind <start> When I'm down in the valley and all that I can see
Is the mountain there before me as big as it can be
I remember in the Bible I can almost hear 'em say
He's work of conciliation that give me strenght today
You can move that mountain if you just believe
You can move that mountain down into the sea
You can move that mountain if you just believe
You can move that mountain try and you'll see
Then I read a little further and see just what he'd said
And I read about the leper how he raised the dead
But I finally found the trouble would mean the most to me
I read about the Master's seed that grew into the tree
You can move that mountain...
When I feel the spirit of the Lord sweeten over me
As he whispers softly in my ear speaking unto me
Now when you get this courage things get in your way
Just listen to this message before you start to pray
If you have a little bit  like that mustard seed
You can say I'm to that mountain falling to the sea
You can move that mountain...
You can move that mountain... <start> I keep tellin' myself that it'll be fine
You can't make everybody happy all of the time
I found myself in a place that I never been
A place that I thought that I could never be
There's people looking back at me
I keep having this dream I'm at a party
There's people throwing drinks
And screaming telling me that I don't belong
Lately life's been the same
I find this comfortable place
With all my friends then
My friends start telling me
That I've always been wrong
And I'm so tired of being wrong
There was a time I could move there was a time I could breathe
The crowded spaces filled with angry faces
It didn't once cross my mind
With paranoia on my heels
Will you love me still
When we awake and see that the sanity has gone from my eyes
I got secrets from you you got secrets from me
Because you're so worried about what I'm gonna to think
Well I'm worried too
But if love is a game girl then you're gonna win
I'll spend the rest of my life bringing victory in
If you want me to <start> Well the train to Grinders
witch is running right on time
And the trucker boys are cooking down in Caroline
People down in Florida can't be still
One of Lynyrd Skynyrd's pickin' down in Jacksonville
People down in Georgia come here and far
To hear Richard Betts pickin' on that red guitar
So get aroundGet around children get down
Well just get down children
Get loudWell you can be loud here
And be proud
Now you can be proud here
Be proud you all be able'
Cause the south's gonna do it again
Alvin
Bishop sittin' on a bale of hay
He ain't good looking but he sure can play
And there's ZZ Top and you can't forget
That ole brother Willie's getting soak and wet
And all the good people down in Tennessee
They're diggin' barefoot Jerry and the C.D.B. <start> When you hold me in your arms I melt like butter
When you kiss my lips I'm yours to command
When you speak my name I just stand there and stutter
For I'm like a piece of puddy in your hands
Oh they say a love like ours knows no reason
That a man can never see beyond his heart
But me mine is you adds up to nothing
And I was nothing till you gave my life a start
You could tell me deffodils bloom in December
Make me believe that snowflakes fall in June
Convince me Santa Claus comes in September
That's all right with me if it's all right with you
That's all right with me if it's all right with you <start> 
Well Interstate  we was cuttin' the fog
Just me an' old Sloan 
We had an eighteenwheeler with ten on the floor and stereo layin' a strip
Now we spied a sign says Eat Gas Now
We decided to whip in and pick up some chow
At the Old Home FillerUp An' Keep On ATruckin' Cafe
Chorus
Oh the Old Home FillerUp An' Keep On ATruckin'
Oh the Old Home FillerUp An' Keep On ATruckin' 
Oh the Old Home FillerUp An' Keep On ATruckin' Cafe
Now we've been every place between here and South Sioux
And we've seen us a truckstop waitress or two
But this gal's built like a burlap bag full of bobcats
She's got it together
Well she filled my tank I said Thank you honey.
Her name was Mavis I gave her the money
Old Sloan just set there watchin' and waggin' and wishin'.
I says You wait in the truck boy.
Then I went inside. She says What'll it be
I says A cup of your best and a number three.
She come back with an order to go and a quart of hot C and a bone for Sloan.
I said Much obliged old Sloan gave a bark
I left her a buck and he left his heart
At the Old Home FillerUp An' Keep On ATruckin' Cafe
Chorus
Oh the Old Home FillerUp An' Keep On ATruckin'
Oh the Old Home FillerUp An' Keep On ATruckin'
Oh the Old Home FillerUp An' Keep On ATruckin' Cafe
Well Saturday night we was truckin' along
Yeah me and old Sloan was agettin' it on
I said Sloan I've been thinkin' on agettin' up my courage and tonight's the night
Well I popped the clutch gave the tranny a spin
Took the Beebeetown ramp and slid on in
To the Old Home FillerUp An' Keep On ATruckin' Cafe
Chorus
Oh the Old Home FillerUp An' Keep On ATruckin'
Oh the Old Home FillerUp An' Keep On ATruckin' 
Oh the Old Home FillerUp An' Keep On ATruckin' Cafe
Well I got me a stool took a load off my shoes
Made Mavis an offer that she couldn't refuse
I says How'd ya like to go for a ride with me and old Sloan I just had my truck warshed.
She allowed as how it sounded like a whole lot of fun
But we was gonna have ta wait until the dishes was done
And was it all right with me if she brought along her mother as a chaperone
I said Why not
Well we geared that tranny into superlow
And the four of us went to see a picture show
Yeah I took 'em to the drivein theater over by Pisgah to see True Grit
Saw the late late show old Sloan hit the sack
And then along about two o'clock I hauled 'em all back
To the Old Home FillerUp An' Keep On ATruckin' Cafe

Some blues are just blues mine are the miner's blues
My troubles are coming by threes and by twos
Blues and more blues it's that coal black blues
Blues and more blues it's that coal black blues
Got coal in my hair got coal in my shoes
These blues are so blue they are the coal black blues
These blues are so blue they are the coal black blues
For my place will cave in and my life I will lose
You say they are blues these old miner's blues
You say they are blues these old miner's blues
Now I must have sharpened these picks that I use <start> Precious mem'ries unseen angels sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger ever near me and the sacred past unfolds
Precious mem'ries how they linger how they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious father loving mother fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood in fond memory appear
Precious mem'ries... <start> Well hello there when did you get back in town
Pull up a chair tell me why you look so down
I'll order us some coffee
We can talk about old times
When the world still turn our way
And you were mine
Those years with you were the best i ever had
Just seeing you brought those precious memories back
And we had some good times and we had some bad
But the worst times with you were still the best i ever had
Guess we should say goodbye it's time to go
Didn't mean to make you cry i just wanted you to know
Those years with you were the best i ever had
Just seeing you brought those precious memories back
And we had some good times and we had some bad
But the worst times with you were still the best i ever had
Yeah the worst times with you were still the best i ever had <start> Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling calling for you and for me
And the heart's portal he's waiting and watching watching for you and for me
Come home  come home 
Ya who are weary come home
Earnestly tenderly Jesus is calling calling oh sinner come home
Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading pleading for you and for me
Why should we linger and heed not his mercies mercies for you and for me
Come home  <start> Ain't Had No Lovin'
Ain't done one single thing this morning
Except of crying all alone
Ain't had no lovin' since you've been gone
And I ain't gonna get no lovin' till you come home
Nothin's been the same since you've left me
Everything has gone from right to wrong
Ain't had no lovin' since you've been gone
And I ain't gonna get no lovin' till you come home
Smiles of yesterday now find me cryin'
The red and golden rainbow turned to blue
With every breath I take I feel like dyin'
A life just ain't worth livin' when I ain't got you
Each and every day I've been without you <start> Well I've been sorta worried
About Santa Claus this year
'Cause we live way out west
And it didn't snow out here
Well I'm a tellin' you not to worry
'Cause I just got the word
Everybody listen closely
And I'll tell you what I heard
Chorus
Santa's comin' in a stagecoach
'Stead of his trusty sleigh
He'll have horses instead of reindeer
To carry him on his way
'Cause the weatherman had some problems
He couldn't get snow you see
Santa's gonna come in a stagecoach
When he visits you and
Well Santa can't bring his reindeer
He'll leave him far away
But don't you worry about him
He's gonna be here Christmas Day
He's gotta big red stagecoat
With jingle bells and all
And there's gonna be merry Christmas
A merry Christmas for all
Santa's gonna come in a stagecoach
'Stead of his trusted sleigh
He'll have horses instead of reindeer
To carry him on his way
'Cause the weatherman had some problems
He couldn't get snow you see
Santa's gonna come in a stagecoach
When he visits you and me
Santa's gonna come in a stagecoach
When he visits you and me... <start> 
Little sparrow little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
All ye maidens hede my warning
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend
They will vow to always love you
Swear no love but yours will do
Then they'll leave you for another
Break your little heart in two
Little sparrow little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
If I were a little sparrow
O'er these mountains I would fly
I would find himyes I would find him
Look into his lying eyes
I would flutter all around him
On my little sparrow wings
I would ask him yes I would ask him
Why he let me love in vain
I am not a little sparrow
I am just the broken dream
Of a cold falsehearted lover
And his evil cunning scheme
Little sparrow little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
All ye maidens fair and tender
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend
Little sparrow little sparrow
Oh the sorrow never ends <start> My rough and rowdy ways have kept me from his grace
But there's hope for me 'cause mommas faith is strong
She's the only hope I've got to keep me in touch with God
But who'll pray for me when mommas gone
who'll pray for me when mommas gone
Who'll ask His forgiveness from then on
Who'll care enough to talk to God
When her pleading voice has stopped
Who'll pray for me when mommas gone
I guess I'm just too weak to fall down on my knees
And talk to God like a man on my own
He knows who I am she mentions me to him
But who'll pray for me when mommas gone
who'll pray for me when mommas gone
Who'll ask His forgiveness from then on
Who'll care enough to talk to God
When her pleading voice has stopped
Who'll pray for me when mommas gone
Who'll pray for me when mommas gone <start> A drunk man walking down a rainy street
A wood floor and new socks on your bare feet
You look down and suddenly you're looking up
Whoops I slipped and fell in love
A bald tire running on an icy road
A steep hill underneath a foot of snow
A greased pig fallen off a pickup truck
Whoops I slipped and fell in love
I hope that you're feeling the way that I feel
It's just like flying but you're standing still
The birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
Whoops I slipped and fell in love
An ice cube hiding on your kitchen floor
A bad step leading up to your back door
How'd I wind up on my butt
Whoops I slipped and feel in love
I hope that you're feeling the way that I feel
It's just like flying but you're standing still
The birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
Whoops I slipped and fell in love
I hope that you're feeling the way that I feel
It's just like flying but you're standing still
The birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
Whoops I slipped and fell in love
Help I've fallen I can't getup
Whoops I slipped and fell in love <start> Looking in the hourglass
Ants in the sand
Reflected in the oil lamp
I can see the wrinkles in your hand
You can be forthright with me
You can be forthright with me
Next to the potbellied stove
Hand on the flue
Photograph on the rolltop desk
Is it of you
You can be forthright with me
You can be forthright with me
Half a pound of hominy
Soaking in a wooden bowl
Underneath the cheesecloth
In the safehold
You can be forthright with me
You can be forthright with me <start> Yes I'm quieter tired
I'm more apt to say
You go on boys I'm good
Think I'll stay in today.
I ain't older 
But that's not why the scales have tipped.
Oh you know I've been chosen to be whipped.
Lion tamer pride life reframer
That warm pot of gold
Always waiting fear abating
To welcome me home from the cold
It's my pleasure or my treasure
It's the opening that I had so dreamed for
Often screamed for I was as I like to die
And then I found her and now I hound her
To get mine fully lipped I'm in love love
And I am absolutely
Whipped.
Must be love
I'm whipped and cowed
And I'll whoop and holler
If I'm allowed. <start> why do you drink to get drunk
why do you smoke to get high <start> Mama you taught me to do the right things
So now you have to let your baby fly
You've given me everything that I will need
To make it through this crazy thing called life
And I know you watch me grow up
And only want what's best for me
And I think I found the answer
To your prayers
And he is good so good
He treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good so good he makes promises he keeps
No he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me
Mama there's no way you'll ever lose me
And giving me away is not goodbye
As you watch me walk down to my future
I hope tears of joy are in your eyes
'Cause he is good so good
And he treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good so good he makes promises he keeps
No he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me
And when I watch my baby grow up
I'll only want what's best for her
And I hope she'll find the answer to my prayers
And that she'll say
He is good so good
And he treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good so good he makes promises he keeps
No he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me
Mama don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me <start> I know it's getting late I hear the mission bells
Parting is bittersweet but this is not farewell
As I give you one last kiss
Just remember this
We'll meet again senorita I won't forget lying here in your arms
You make it so hard to leave ya Hasta Luego my love
We knew the time would come
We'd have to say goodbye
I'll hold you in my dreams each and every night
I know as I walk away my heart will say
We'll meet again senorita
I will miss you mi amor yo te quiero
We'll meet again senorita <start> your nobody called today she hung up when I ask her name <start> Abandon all those precious things
One soul now
Carry only what twilight brings
One soul now
Watch the color drain from the sky
One soul now
Stillness settles glides on by
One soul now
Chorus
I don't understand how these things
Move the way they do
Collide the way they do
Feel the way they do
When we touch the way we do
Fireflies drift on a midnight fog
One soul now
Twinkling gifts from a puzzling god
One soul now
Journey out into the fields
One soul now
Crane our necks and watch us wheel
One soul now
Chorus x <start> Won't you take me home to mama she loves me and she'll keep me safe and warm
All I ask is take me home to mama please take me home to mama's arms
Oh greyhound bus I bet she could never guess
Where I got the money to buy this ticket home
Well I tell you after years of tears and hard work today I made it
I reached bottom I've begged on the street that's how I got it
Won't you take me home to mama...
I've lost many things in my life but today I lost my pride
So ol' greyhound take me home to mama I need some love inside
All I ask is take me home to mama please take me home to mama's arms <start> You walk into the party and there's no denyin' that you're
kinda pretty
you giggle when you order your wine or your vodka
and the men act silly
even my man too
and that's why women like me don't like girls like you
You say it's gettin' cold 'cos you forgot your coat
and you borrow his
but you won't return it 'til your perfume's through it
'cos it's a great fit
but his wife won't think it cute
and that's why women like me don't like girls like you
Ohh never have and never will like girls like you
no never know and never trust what you might do
you think the world revolves around you
love this song is written 'bout ya' too
and that's why women like me don't like girls like you
You're just the girl from work but you're a full time flirt
and you ask my man for a ride
and then you send him a text it says thanks you're the best
with a kiss and a smile
so I send one back too
yeah that's why women like me don't like girls like you
Ohh never have and never will like girls like you
no never know and never trust what you might do
you think the world revolves around you
love this song is written 'bout ya' too
and that's why women like me don't like girls like you
Interlude
Ohh never have and never will like girls like you
no never know and never trust what you might do
you think the world revolves around you
love this song is written 'bout ya' too
and that's why women like me don't like girls like you
women like me don't like girls like you
So when we're way past thirty and things aren't so perky
all that matters is inside
I'll be there for you
cost that's when women like me will like girls like you
Uh uh <start> She says she hates me and not to call
She's used her pain to build a concrete wall
She's rolled her angry words into a fist
But that's not who she is
That's not who she is
I slammed the phone down hard and walked outside
I wrote her off that day as if she'd died
Said if she burns in hell well I won't give a damn
But that's not who I am
That's not who I am
Lost behind the masks we wear
The barbed wire fences of our fear
We drag each other through these tears
And strike the wounds that scar
But that's not who we are
That's not who we are
Someday I'll hold her for this I pray
That time and grace will roll the stone away
And we'll love each other with open hearts
Just for who we are
Just for who we are
A mother who gave all she could
A child who tried to just be good
In father brother sisterhood
We reach and fall so far
Like dust of ancient stars
That's just who we are
Dust of ancient stars
That's just who we are <start> Where are you now
Who's holdin' you now
When your world stands still do you remember
Leaves were fallin'
We were fallin'
Almost like a dream do you remember
Seasons changed
We both changed
Sometimes I go back to when
We ran put our feet in the water
We danced didn't care who could see
We sang every song to each other
Summer would end but not for me
I still feel the hope in your kisses
I still feel the sun on your skin
I swear I was holdin' forever back then
Do you remember
Where I am now
Is where I should be now
You're so far away but always with me
And it seems like
Another life
Whenever I go back to when
We ran put our feet in the water
We danced didn't care who could see
We sang every song to each other
Summer would end but not for me
I still feel the hope in your kisses
I still feel the sun on your skin
I swear I was holdin' forever back then
Do you remember
We ran we kissed we learned to love to live
We ran put our feet in the water
We danced didn't care who could see
We sang every song to each other
Summer would end but not for me
I still feel the hope in your kisses
I still feel the sun on your skin
I swear I was holdin' forever back then
Do you remember
Do you remember <start> Writer Myra Brooks Welch
Twas battered and scared and the auctioneer
Thought it scarcely worth his while
To waste much time on the old violin
But he held it up with a smile.
What am I bidden good folks he cried
Who'll start bidding for me
A dollar a dollar  now wholl make it two 
Two dollars and wholl make it three
Three dollars once three dollars twice
Going for three. . . but no
From the room far back a grayhaired man
Came forward and picked up the bow
Then wiping the dust from the old violin
And tightening up the strings
He played a melodypure and sweet
As sweet as an angel sings.
The music ceased and the auctioneer
With a voice that was quiet and low
Said What am I bidden for the old violin
And he held it up with the bow
A thousand dollars  and who'll make it two
Two thousand  and who'll make it three
Three thousand once three thousand twice
And going  and gone said he.
The people cheered but some of them cried
We do not quite understand 
What changed its worth The man replied
The touch of the masters hand.
And many a man with life out of tune
And battered and torn with sin
Is auctioned cheap to a thoughtless crowd.
Much like the old violin.
A mess of pottage a glass of wine
A game and he travels on
He's going once and going twice 
He's going  and almost gone
But the MASTER comes and the foolish crowd
Never can quite understand
The worth of a soul and the change that's wrought
By the touch of the MASTER'S hand. <start> Sometimes my nails match my lips
And my jeans hug my hips
But I don't feel like doing all that right now
He's on his way over
And my hair's in a ponytail holder
And my true colors are coming out
You better love me when my roots are showing
Or I'll pack up my boots and be going byebyebyebyebye
If it's me that he's impressed with
Anything I might be dressed in
Ought to be just fine
If he's the one for me I'll know it
You better love me when my roots are showing
If overalls turn him off
If he don't like the way I talk
Well that's alright with me
I am a product of
My momma daddy and the place I love
What he gets is what he sees
You better love me when my roots are showing
Or I'll pack up my boots and be going byebyebyebyebye
If it's me that he's impressed with
Anything I might be dressed in
Ought to be just fine
If he's the one for me I'll know it
You better love me
You better love me when my roots are showing <start> THE OLD TRAIL
WRITERS CHARLES JOHN QUARTO STEVE GILLETTE
There's a new ridge road that cuts the mountain to the bone. Slices through the woods like there ain't nobody home. You wheel on up the valley view. You'll never feel the climb. Oh but I'll take the old trail every time.
The old trail just mosies right along moves at the speed of a sweet love song and the wind through the trees carries her own wind chimes. Yeah I'll take the old trail every time.
Lately it seems things vanish by degrees. How soon we forget we made our tree houses out of trees. When we going to realize some reasons just don't rhyme. Yeah I take the old trail every time. <start> Hold me kiss me whisper to me our love will go on forever
Want me need me tell me sweetly our love will go on forever
Forever and ever my heart will be true forever and ever I'll love only you
Hold me kiss me whisper to me our love will go on forever <start> Rows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care don't let them know
Don't give yourself away
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love
I really don't know love at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say I love you right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads they tell me that I've changed
Well somethings lost but somethings gained
In living every day
I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life
I really don't know life at all <start> full growed porcupine dead on the road

' Careers BMG Music
I met her sadly in the slowly falling rain
Crying softly in her loveliness and pain
Knowing no one needin' someone bad as me
And she told me as I held her trembling hand
Walking slowly how she'd never known a man
Living lonely in her cottage by the sea
When the morning came her tears had changed to laughter
And before the night her heart beat close to mine
And I thought as she lay sleeping bout the secrets she was keeping
Hidden somewhere in the silence of the shadows of her mind
In the morning as I wakened with the dawn
Without warning I could feel that she was gone
Leaving nothing but her silence next to me
And lonely footprints that I followed in the sand
Walking slowly for I knew where they would end
Disappearing in the silence of the sea
And I sometimes hear the echo of her laughter
As I search for what I know I'll never find
For the answer I was seeking was the secrets she's still keeping
Hidden somewhere in the silence of the shadows of her mind
Hidden somewhere in the silence of the shadows of her mind <start> In a little cafe just the other side of the border
She was a sitting there giving me looks that made my mouth water
So I started walking her way she belongs to bad man Jose
And I knew yes I knew I should leave then I heard her say
Come a little bit closer you my kind of man so big and so strong
Come a little bit closer I'm all alone and the night is so long
So we started to dance in my arms she felt so inviting
And I just couldn't resist the one a little kiss so exciting
Then I heard the guitar player say Vamos Jose's on his way
And I knew yes I knew I should leave then I heard her say
Come a little bit closer
Then the music stopped when I looked the cafe was empty
Then I heard Jose say man you know you're in trouble plenty
So I dropped my drink from my hand and through the window I ran
And as I rode away I could hear her say to Jose
Come a little bit closer <start> See that cowboy at the bar
The one at the end with all the scars
He got stomped by the meanest bronc in Santa Fe
But if he looks a little down and out
It ain't that bronc he's thinking about
It's that girl that broke his heart along the way
When a cowboy falls he falls hard
Sometimes he falls way too far
But you can bet that when he hits the ground
He'll get back up and play the part
Even with a broken heart
He'll hold the reins and hide the pain inside
Love's always a cowboy's toughest ride
Girl just listen to me now
I should know what I'm talking about
Everything I learned I learned from you
I have rode broncs from hell
And it hurt me every time I fell
But not half as much pain as you put me through
When a cowboy falls he falls hard
Sometimes he falls way too far
But you can bet that when he hits the ground
He'll get back up and play the part
Even with a broken heart
He'll hold the reins and hide the pain inside
Love's always a cowboy's toughest ride <start> Down to a dollar in a terrible fix i was hopin my bookie would call
Coolin my heels at the motel six waitin for the axe to fall
Phone rings man i'm white as a ghost
But it's my baby on the line from the jersey coast she says
C'mon home honey gonna make it after all and it's
First stop salt lake city
Big springs laramie lookin mighty pretty
Ogallala north platte sun settin in it
Newton to chicago in a new york minute
Then it's hobart elkhart maumee cuyanoga
Youngstown hazletown dover i'm a flyin over
Fairfax bloomfield bless a my soul
Highway  she's a might good road
I saw me a yarn on the tv set about the surfers out in malibalou
So i bought me some baggies and i hopped me a jet just to see if them stories was true
Well the water was cold and the beer was hot
Called my baby from the parkin lot i said
Baby do you miss me honey you know that i do
And it's first stop salt lake city...
Now if i was a actor or a highrollin hippie i would head out for the califoline
Cruise my caddie up and down the strip hollywood and bygod vine
But i'm an oklahoma boy and i'm east coast bound
Got a redneck woman in a blueblood town
And i'm goin back to see my baby just one more time
And it's first stop salt lake city... <start> Hey Mr Tambourine man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr Tambourine man play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into the sand
Vanished from my hand left me blindly here to stand
But still not sleeping my weariness amazes me
I'm branded on my feet and I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty streets too dead for dreaming
Hey Mr Tambourine man play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
 ac.guitar 
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship
My senses have been stripped and my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step wait only for my bootheels to go wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade cast your dancing spell my way I promise to go under it
Hey Mr Tambourine man... <start> Oh sometimes I go walkin' through fields where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old mem'ries like that or do I ever cross your mind
 fiddle  mandolin 
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Cause you miss me do you darling
Oh and do your mem'ries ever take you back into another place in time
And do you ever miss the feelings and the love we shared
When you were with me tell me darling or do I ever cross your mind
 guitar 
Oh how often I wish that again I could kiss your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two lovin' arms that once held me so gentle and close
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever recall these old mem'ries at all or do I ever cross your mind
Tell me darling do I ever cross your mind <start> We were sitting in our backyard
Waiting for the stars to show.
But the city lights shine too far
On and on the grey skies glow.
Took my bike out on Harbord Street
Rode up Bathurst to Saint Clair
Started countin' cars surrounding me
My lungs burstin' for some cleaner air.
It was sadder than the morning doe
Much funnier than a clown.
But when push comes to shove
Oh I still love this town.
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
I was waitin' on the eastbound train
Headed out to see the suburbs
When I thought I heard my name.
It was just a crazy lady slurrin' words.
It was sadder than a weepin' willow.
As silly as a dog with a bone.
But when you ask me 'bout it
I'll still call this my home.
Do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Oh oh
Do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Early mornin' on a Saturday
The bustle wakes us up in bed.
Construction trucks kids in the park at play
No quiet place to lay our heads.
I was madder than the old hatter
I was crazy as the Cheshire Cat
But when we get to the heart of the matter
This is where I'll hang my hat.
Do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Oh oh
Do do do do
Do do do do do do do do  <start> Prettiest one never talked to me
Bought her a coke and Jim Bean
Sting of bourbon on her lips
Big tab and twenty dollar tip
She put her hand on my thigh
So I grabbed my wallet and opened wide
She didn't like me but she loved my money
Cleared my clouds and made it sunny
She wanted friends and I wanted honey
She didn't like me but she loved my money
I asked her if I could take her home
Nervous my expense account had grown
She put her bosom to my face
Hope my money didn't go to waste
A man can only spend so much
Getting played by a woman's touch
She didn't like me but she loved my money
Cleared my clouds and made it sunny
She wanted friends and I wanted honey
She didn't like me but she loved my money
I guess I ain't no big bank hank
All my bread wound up in the tank
So I go to bed with her on my mind
And I'm flat broke one more time
A man can only spend so much
Getting played by a woman's touch
But tomorrow night I'll try again
I try to be more than just her friend
She didn't like me but she loved my money
Cleared my clouds and made it sunny
She wanted friends and I wanted honey
She didn't like me but she loved my money
She didn't like me but she loved my money <start> and the great boat sank

Just the way you did back then
A feelin' that I almost left behind
It's been such a long long time
Say the things you used to say
Make me feel the same old way
A feelin' that I almost left behind
It's been such a long long time
Does it ever stop changing
Does it ever change at all
How can we pick up the pieces
After we let them fall
If they ever were there at all
Does it ever stop changing
Does it ever change at all
How can we pick up the pieces
After we let them fall
If they ever were there at all
The same old look is in your eyes
The feelin's that you can't disguise
A feelin' that I almost left behind
It's been such a long long time
Do the things you used to do
Make me fall in love with you
A feelin' that I almost left behind
It's been such a long long time <start> There's a plane flyin' outta here tonight
Destination New Orleans.
Boss man says my big promotion's on the line
He says that's right where I need to be.
Lately I've been on the road more than I've been home.
All this leavin' her alone is killin' me.
And holdin' her right now has got me thinkin' more an' more
This is right where I need to be.
Where when I hear her I can see her
I can smell her sweet perfume.
I can feel her skin against me when I sleep.
Where I won't miss her I can kiss her anytime that I want to.
Yeah that's right where I need to be.
Yeah that's right where I need to be.
Wow.
There's a plane flyin' outta here tonight
With an empty firstclass seat.
'Cause I've finally got all my priorities in line
And I'm right where I need to be. <start> Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever thats so hard to bear
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning fever all through the night.
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
Because I know your gonna treat me right
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning fever all through the night.
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago.
Romeo loved Juliet Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said Julie baby you're my thing
You give us fever when we kisseth
Fever with the flaming youth
Fever I'm on fire Fever yea I burn forsooth.
Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair
When her Daddy tried to kill him
She said Daddyo don't do that
He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever I'm his misses Daddy won't you treat him right.
Now you've listened to my story
And here's a point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it farenheight or centigrade
They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever if you live your life
Fever 'til you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn... <start> I phoned her today an accidental mistake
And her name slipped out to some friend
Forgotten old feelin's brand new today'
'Cause I'm right back where I've always been
She's just an old love turned memory
And now I seldom see her around
She's just an old love turned memory
But she still turns my world upside down
I went to some places where I knew she'd be
Just to prove love was over and done
But the moment her eyes touched mine I knew
My sorrow had only begun
She's just an old love turned memory
And now I seldom see her around
She's just an old love turned memory
But she still turns my world upside down <start> With so much drama in the LBC
It's kinda hard bein Snoop DOdoubleG

You got to get yours before I get mine
Everything is fine when you listenin to the DOG

As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
i started laughin with this bitch named Sadie 
 She used to be the homeboy's lady

Raise up off these NUT's cause you gets none of these
At ease as I mob with the Dogg Pound feel the breeze

To serve me not with a cherry on top

Rollin down the street smokin indo sippin on gin and juice 
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin down the street smokin indo sippin on gin and juice 
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind <start> High on that lonesome road to heaven's blessed abode
For many years I was burdened with care
So often lightening flashed and raging billows dashed
My sorrow then was so heavy to bear
But since my Jesus came I praise his holy name
He sheds the light of his wonderful grace
And every night and day to him I steal away
I found a blessed hiding place
I found a hiding place a blessed hiding place
I said a hiding a blessed hiding place
There's glory in my soul my hallelujah rolls
But since my Jesus came I'm under his control
He keeps me night and day He answers when I pray
And from the raging storm to Him I steal away
I hear those temptors knock I feel no temply shock
Oh in the solid rock I found a hiding place
Just like a wandering Jew that had no place to choose
Each day I had to keep travelin' on
But now I've found the way that leads to endless days
No more in darkness I wander alone
When Satan would alarm I climb in God's strong arm
And hide away in his loving embrace
For in the solid rock the blessed solid rock
I found a blessed hiding place <start> AN ANGEL SLEEPS BESIDE ME EVERY NIGHT

' Acoustic Music
An angel sleeps beside me every night
Without her love my world would fade away
Yes an angel sleeps beside me every night
And because of her my sun shines every day
Sometimes when the outside world starts to get me down
And I'm sure that I can't make it till the dawn
Just knowing she's upon the bed beside the place I lay my head
Revives the faith I have in goin' on
Cause an angel sleeps beside me every night...
Cause an angel sleeps beside me every night...
Yes an angel sleeps beside me every night... <start> Every other Sunday at the skate land south
I always end up with my skate in my mouth
Maybe this is the day I can make some okay sentences
Hell I mights as well undo my laces because there she is
All marshmallow white and bubblegum pink
Her dreamsicle roller skates circle the rink
And this pastel heaven can last until seven or eight
If my mom watches Falcon Crest sometimes she picks me up late
Hey D.J. play the one I know you know
As we roll across the carpet smooth and slow
Ease the neon nice and low
The next one is couple skate only
My friends bet their quarters that I'm gonna cave
But this seventh soda pop's making me brave
Or maybe it's the black lite but the moment looks right to me
So I roll up like Romeo Juliet say can you see
That video game that's Galaxia 
One day I'll get the highest score
And I'll type in your name I wanna share all this fame with you
And we'll celebrate with a couple skate or two
Hey D.J. play the one I know you know
As we roll across the carpet smooth and slow
Ease the neon nice and low
The next one is couple skate only
Celebrate good times

But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok
When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight tight yeah
It's been a hard day's night and I've been working like a dog

WRITERS GEORGE RICHEY ROGER BOWLING JAN CRUTCHFIELD
I've been sitting here alone all night
Thinking 'bout things that I'm gonna write
When you read this goodbye note you'll know I've had enough
But it should come at no surprise to you
Knowing you treat me the way you do
You've made lovin' too hard and living too rough
I just need a good place to start
To say what I really feel in my heart
And what I'm gonna write to you is long overdue
And don't expect me to change my mind
Or try to read something between the lines
Make no mistake about it baby we're through
But every word I write comes out I love you
I just want to say it's over no matter how I try
Every word I write comes out I love you
Guess I've loved you much too long to say goodbye <start> I see these creatures in tired action
I hold the blade with the midnight arm
My brother dreams in real violence
My brother dreaming through the red
In ritual positions I kneel before his love
Far away from the world
I follow all these signs and wonders
I walk on by the suicide doors
Under the stars in animism
I'll hold the mirror for the ghost
In ritual positions I kneel before his love
Sometimes in benediction a mouth to sing the flood
Far away from the world <start> 
Goodbye sunshine gee but I'll miss your smile
Don't cry sunshine I'll be back in a while
And when I'm lonesome and the lonely tears start
I'll think of you and there'll be bluebirds in my heart
Keep those blue eyes full of love just for me
And there'll be blue skies anyplace I may be
And don't you worry everything will be fine I'll walk the line
Here comes the train kiss me again goodbye sunshine

Keep those blue eyes full of love...
Goodbye sunshine  <start> If you love somebody enough
You'll follow wherever they go
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis
If you love somebody enough
You'll go where your heart wants to go
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis
I know if you'd seen her you'd tell me cause you are my friend
I've got to find her and find out the trouble she's in
And if you tell me she's not here
You can follow the trail of my tears
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis
She'd get mad and she used to say
She'd come back to Memphis someday
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis
I haven't eaten a bite
Or slept for three days and nights
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis
I've got to find her and tell her that I love her so
I'll never rest til I find out why she had to go
So thank you for your precious time
Forgive me if I start to cry
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis <start> Do you like it when the meter's jumpin'
You like the sound of them horses runnin'
Do you like it when the tweeter's tweetin'
Do you like it when the back seat's bumpin'
Do you like a little kick in your coke
Do you like it goin' up in smoke
Do you like it on a gravel road
We can keep it on the down low
Tell me how you like it 
You know I wanna try it 
Baby if you don't mind it 
We can kick it down in four and you can drive
Pretty girl you can ride it
We can all night it 
You don't have to hide it 
Just tell me how
Tell me how you like it
Do you like it on a riverbank
Do you like it when the sun done sank
Do you like it when the full moon's high
And it's shinin' down into your drink
Do you like it when the tailgate's down
Do you like it when we take it to the ground
Tell me baby how does that sound
Either way you know it's goin' down
Tell me how you like it 
You know I wanna try it 
Baby if you don't mind it 
We can kick it down in four and you can drive
Pretty girl you can ride it
We can all night it 
You don't have to hide it 
Just tell me how
Tell me how you like it
Baby why you gotta look so pretty
With your hair so soft and long
You're damn sure turnin' me on
Tonight we gettin' out of the city
Leave it all behind get a little lost
Baby you make the call
Tell me how you like it 
You know I wanna try it 
Baby if you don't mind it 
We can kick it down in four and you can drive
Pretty girl you can ride it
We can all night it 
You don't have to hide it 
Just tell me how
Tell me how you like it
Do you like it in the shotgun seat
With the highway flyin' right under your feet 
Do you like it with the radio on 
Tell me how you like it
Do you like it by the bonfire heat
If it gets too hot we can take it to the creek 
Let's make it last all night long 
Tell me how you like it <start> Oh lighten up where's your sense of humor
They're just tiny little rumors
That I started 'cause I'm lookin' out for you
Ah settle down I'm just a little jealous
And I'm sure those other fellas
Never once believed the lies I told were true
Like the time I told that cowboy that you used to be a man
And the doctor you were datin' that you hide your wedding band
Even if I am responsible for scaring them away
You really ought to thank me I was doin' you a favor
'Cause it never woulda worked out anyway
Ah can't you see the reason that I'm doin'
All the crazy things I'm doin'
Is because I really care about you girl
And I'll admit that I go a little farther
Than I know I probably oughta
But it's all because I need you in my world
Like the time I told that lawyer that you spent a year in jail
And the salesman you were seein' you hang out at cheap motels
Even if I am responsible for scaring them away
You really ought to thank me I was doin' you a favor
'Cause it never woulda worked out anyway
I can't stand the thought of you with anybody else
I know I've gone overboard but I can't help myself
Like the time I told that dentist you had seven little kids
And you doubled as a dancer at the strip joint on the ridge
Even if I am responsible for scaring him away
You really ought to thank me I was doin' you a favor
'Cause it never woulda worked out anyway
It's all because I love you and I can't stop thinkin' of you
And it never woulda worked out anyway <start> She rose out of bed wipes the sleep out of her eyes
I know she's bound to be tired but she looks so satisfied
We stayed up a little late last night
I guess I must be doing something right
My baby's got a smile on her face
My baby's got a smile on her face oh yeah
As soon as I get to work I call her on the phone
I wanna tell her that I love her I can't wait til I get home
She doesn't say a word when I walk in
Looks like we might not get much sleep again
'Cause my baby's got a smile on her face
My baby's got a smile on her face 
My baby's got a smile on her face yeah I wanna make a life together
My baby's got a smile on her just look at 'er gotta look at her
Take a look at that smile on her face <start> I know promises can vanish in thin air
This life comes with no guarantees
Everything I have can all be gone
And leave me emptyhanded fallin' on my knees
When I get knocked down weak and confused
I gain strength with every thought of you
Chorus
You make me fearless
You make every day for me
Fearless you make it easy to believe
You'll always be there for me whatever I go through
That's the difference between your love and this world
I'm fearless with you
I used to wake up afraid to face the day
Almost counting on something going wrong
I'd get scared thinking I was all alone
But now there's comfort in knowing I belong
In your arms wrapped up in your love
The only place I feel safe enough
Chorus
With you by my side
I let go and close my eyes
And I feel like I can fly
Chorus <start> She was born in the brief mountain springtime
Blue in the late mountain snow
And she grew in the sunlight of summer
But she knew when the aspen turned gold
That she had grown old
Chorus
Columbine columbine
Blue in the Rockies
Well I missed you while you were away
Will I see you next summer wild on the mountain
Will you be there when I pass your way
She was there in the brief mountain springtime
Blue in the late mountain snow
And we lived in the sunlight of summer
But I knew when the aspen turned gold
That I had grown old
Chorus
Columbine columbine
Blue in the Rockies
Will you miss me when I've gone away
Will I see you next summer wild on the mountain
Will you be there when I pass your way <start> This ol' highway's getting longer
Seems there ain't no end in sight
To sleep would be best but I just can't afford to rest
I've got to ride in Denver tomorrow night
I called the house but no one answered
For the last two weeks no one's been home
I guess she's through with me to tell the truth I just can't see
What's kept the woman holding on this long
And the white line's getting longer and the saddle's getting cold
I'm much too young to feel this damn old
All my cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole
I'm much too young to feel this damn old
The competition's getting younger
Tougher broncs you know I can't recall
The worn out tape of Chris LeDoux lonely women and bad booze
Seem to be the only friends I've left at all
And the white line's getting longer and the saddle's getting cold
I'm much too young to feel this damn old
All my cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole
I'm much too young to feel this damn old
Lord I'm much too young to feel this damn old <start> Born to lose I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose it seems so hard to bear
How I long to always have you near
You've grown tired and now you say we're through
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose my every hope is gone
It's so hard to face an empty dawn
You were all the happiness I knew
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose and now I'm losing you <start> Watch how she tore me all apart
Watch how she ripped up my heart
Watch how she cut that thing clean through
Watch out she'll do the same to you
Watch how she wrecked love's hope filled train
Watch how she reveled in my shame
Watch how she learned me who was boss
It was gone before it ever went away
Got up and left before it even really tried to stay
And any doubt that hung around sure ain't here now
She's the best dirty trick love's ever played
Watch how she tossed my affections 'round
Watch how she drug'em cross the ground
Watch how she claimed they're hers to use
Watch out or she'll drag yours for you <start> Away in a manger no crib for his bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.
The cattle are lowing the baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love thee Lord Jesus Look down from the sky
And stay by my side until morning is nigh. <start> oh rose can i share a BED WITH YOUI'M LONESOME AND I HAVE NO PLACE TO GO <start> Willie lived in London a citymill in town
Willie lived in London a citymill in town
I met a beautiful lady her beauty'd never been found
They called her Pretty Polly come go along with me
Polly Pretty Polly come go along with me
Before we get married some place you will see
Willie oh Willie I'm 'fraid of your ways
Willie oh Willie I'm 'fraid of your ways
The way you've been ramblin' you'll lead me astray
They went up o'er the mountain and what did they spy
They went up o'er the mountain and what did they spy
A newlydug grave and a spade lyin' by
Polly Pretty Polly your guess is 'bout right
Polly Pretty Polly your guess is 'bout right
I dug on your grave in the heart of last night
He stabbed'er through her heart and her heart's blood did flow
He stabbed'er through her heart and her heart's blood did flow
And into her grave Pretty Polly did go
He threw a little dirt over her and turned to go home
He threw a little dirt over her and turned to go home
Leave nothing behind but the wild birds to roam
Pretty Polly Polly Pretty Polly <start> If I knew what made the world go round or made the raindrops tumble down
Then I'd know why I love you
If I knew what made the flowers bloom or made the Man up in the Moon
Then I'd know why I love you
If I knew what made the blue blue sky if I knew what made the robin fly
If I knew what made the chill of morning dew
If I knew what made the river flow if I knew what made the north wind blow
Then I'd know why I love you
If I knew what made the blue blue sky
Then I'd know why I love you <start> Who'll walk me down to church when I'm sixty years of age
When the ragged dog they gave me has been ten years in the grave
And senorita play guitar play it just for you
My rosary has broken and my beads have all slipped through
You've hung up your great coat and you've laid down your gun
You know the war you fought in wasn't too much fun
And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years on
Yes I'll sit with you and talk let your eyes relive again
I know my vintage prayers would be very much the same
And Magdelena plays the organ plays it just for you
Your choral lamp that burns so low when you are passing through
And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years on <start> You're gonna run out of cigarettes
And we're gonna run out of wine
We haven't even started the good stuff yet
It's okay we've got plenty of time
So pull up a comfortable chair baby
And put on those records that drive me crazy
You look so good in this light
Oh yeah you look like nothing but mine
I wanna love you like the world's gonna stop
'Til the very last second last tick of that clock
I'm gonna slow it all down and then take you from zero to ten
Oh I wanna love you like I'll never love you again
Let's make this night last forever
Like honey dripping sweet and slow
Every kiss just tasting better
Every touch every whisper let go
I wanna love you like the world's gonna stop
'Til the very last second last tick of that clock
I'm gonna slow it all down and then take you from zero to ten
Yeah I wanna love you like I'll never love you again
Ooh yeah <start> I spent half my life on bended knee
Begging somebody to change
And the other half prayin' to God
That they never would
And all it got me was twice as lost
When it all turned out the same
But all that beggin' finally did somebody good
I used to dream all night
Of a day that was gone
But come the mornin' light
Forever from now on
Gunna do my dreamin' with my eyes wide open
I'll do my looking back
With my eyes closed
We can do some livin'
Or spend our whole lives hopin'
End the end we're left with
The one we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open
Every time the world moved on
I fell a little further behind
From runnin' back or followin someone home
Until I learned that one step forward
Will take you further on
Than a thousand back or a million that ain't
Your own
I used to dream all night
Of a day that was gone
But come the mornin' light
Forever from now on
Gunna do my dreamin' with my eyes wide open
I'll do my looking back
With my eyes closed
We can do some livin'
Or spend our whole lives hopin'
End the end we're left with
The one we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open
We can do some livin'
or spend our whole lives hopin'
In the end we're left with
The ones we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open <start> For just one chance to find
Love was someone that you loved to find
For just the sense to try
To walk ahead and leave the pain behind
If the days aren't easy and the nights are rough
When they ask you what you're thinking of
Say love say for me love
Say love say for me love
Your heart says not again
What kind of mess have you got me in
But when the feelings there
It can lift you up and take you anywhere
But the gravel beneath you and the limbs above
If anybody asks you where your coming from
Say love say for me love
Say love say for me love
Say yes we live uncertainty
And disappointments have to be
And everyday we might be facing more
And yes we live in desperate times
But fading words and shaking rhymes
There's only one thing here worth hoping for
With Lucifer beneath you and God above
If either one of them asks you what your living of
Say love say for me love
Say love say for me love
Say love say for me love
Say love say for me love
Say love say for me love
Say love say for me love <start> Jingle bell jingle bell jingle bell rock

That's when the trouble started
She said Adam let's go for a bite
She led him to the garden
And ever since then
We tried to make sense
Of this mystery emotion
But we might as well try
To count the stars in the skies
Or those raindrops in the ocean
Will you know it's true love
Deeper than deep
Hotter than the fire
When it's hard to find
And it's harder to keep
It's the thing we most desire
I was alone for so many nights
I really started to wonder
If I had run out of chances to find
A spell I could fall under
Then you walked in
Like in an Elvis film
You were singing Love Me Tender
I was hypnotized
By your blue eyes
And the next thing I remember
Will you know it's true love
Deeper than deep
Hotter than the fire
When it's hard to find
And it's harder to keep
It's the thing we most desire
And there is a true love
In a winking eye and
A sweet perfume that lingers
And it's an I love you
On a new tattoo and
That diamond on her finger
Will you know it's true love
Deeper than deep
Hotter than the fire
When it's hard to find
And it's harder to keep
It's the thing we most desire <start> It was on a Wednesday night the moon was shining bright
They robbed the Glendale train
And the people they did say for many miles away
Twas the outlaws Frank and Jesse James
Jesse had a wife to mourn all her life
Their children they are brave
Twas a dirty little coward that shot Mr Howard
They laid Jesse James in his grave
It was Robert Ford the dirty little coward
I wonder how he does feel
For he ate of Jesse's bread and he slept in Jesse's bed
Then he laid Jesse James in his grave
Jesse had a wife to mourn all her life
It was his brother Frank that robbed the Gallatin bank
And carried the money from the town
It was in this very place that they had a little race
For they shot Captain Sheets to the ground
Jesse was a man a friend to the poor
He never would see a man suffer pain
And with his brother Frank he robbed the Chicago bank
And stopped the Glendale train
It was his brother Frank that robbed the Gallatin bank
And carried the money from the town
It was in this very place that they had a little race
For they shot Captain Sheets to the ground
Jesse had a wife to mourn all her life
They went to the crossing not very far from there
And there they did the same
And the agent on his knees he delivered up the keys
To the outlaws Frank and Jesse James
Jesse had a wife to mourn all her life
It was on a Saturday night Jesse was at home
Talking to his family brave
When the thief and the coward a little Robert Ford
Laid Jesse James in his grave
How people held their breath when they heard of Jesse's death
And wondered how he ever came to die
Twas one of the gang dirty Robert Ford
That shot poor Jesse on the sly
Jesse had a wife to mourn all her
Jesse went to rest with his hand on his breast
The devil will be upon his knee
He was born one day in the county of Clay
And came from the solitary race
Jesse had a wife to mourn all her life
They laid Jesse James in his grave <start> Twilight falls
Evening shadows find
There 'neath the stars a maiden so fair divine.
The moon on high seemed to see her there
In her eyes was a light shining ever so bright
As she whisper'd a silent pray'r.
Ev'ry word revealed an empty broken heart
Broken by fate that holds them so far apart.
Lonely there she kneels and tells the stars above
In her arms he belongs then her pray'r is a song
Her unending song of love. <start> 
You say that you're bored with life and that you're bored with me
'Cause you say that this love of ours ain't what it ought to be
Now you despise this little house that we've always called home
I know that you don't love me now but you'll love me when I'm gone
Gone
You'll love me when I'm gone and then you'll realize just what I meant to you
Youoooooo
You'll miss me when I'm gone and then you'll realize how good I've been to you
Youooooooooo
You'll want me when I'm gone and then you'll realize you've loved me all along
Oh it's true you may not love me now but you'll love me when I'm gone
Gone
We've grown too familiar with each other so you say
You say there's no excitement now. Too bad you feel that way
Well I wonder how exciting that your life will be alone
Oh I know you may not want me now but you'll miss me when I'm gone
Gone
You'll love me when I'm gone and then you'll realize just what I meant to you
Youoooooo
You'll miss me when I'm gone and then you'll realize how good I've been to you
Youooooooooo
You'll want me when I'm gone and then you'll realize you've loved me all along
Oh I know you may not want me now but you'll miss me when I'm gone
Gone <start> 
Hello God are you out there
Can you hear me are you listenin' any more
Hello God if we're still on speakin' terms
Can you help me like before
I have questioned your existence
My resistance leaves me cold
Can you help me go the distance
Hello God hello hello
This old world has gone to pieces
Can we fix it is there time
Hate and violence just increases
We're so selfish cruel and blind
We fight and kill each other
In your name defending you
Do you love some more than others
We're so lost and confused
Hello God are you out there
Can you hear us are you listenin' any more
Hello God if we're still on speakin' terms
Can you help us like before
Oh the free will you have given
We have made a mockery of
This is no way to be livin'
We're in great need of your love
Hello God
Hello God can you grant us
Love enough to make amends
 Is there still a chance
That we could start again
Hello God we've learned our lesson
Dear God don't let us go
More than ever
Hello God hello hello
Hello God we really need you
We can't make it without you
 We beseech you
In the name of all that's true
Hello God please forgive us
For we know not what we do
Hello God give us one more chance to prove ourselves to you
Hello God hello God <start> IF I LIVED HERE

RECORDED BY DEL REEVES
You don't know how I've enjoyed these past few hours
The candle light the dinner and the drinks
Your lips were never quite so warm and tender
I hold you close and I can't help but think
If I lived here I'd be home now
I'd take off my shoes lie down and just relax
If I lived here I'd be home now
But I don't and he does and he'll soon be coming back
I wish that was my name on your mailbox
I could play and tussle with the kids
We'd all dress up for church on Sunday morning
Oh why did he meet you before I did
If I lived here I'd be home now
We could stay like this forever and a day
If I lived here I'd be home now
But I don't and he does and I'd best be on my way <start> Hello beautiful are you married  tell me are you happy 
But sometimes I feel like I've just got to get away
From the same old existence day after day
Oh haven't you ever felt that way 
I can see you're married don't you love her 
But you have thought of cheating haven't you 
Sometimes I long for a warm tender kiss
Just to see if there's anything I might have missed
Oh haven't you ever felt like this 
And it's beginning to feel like this might be one of those sometimes
Those one times in a lifetime
I'm aching to hold you kiss and console you drive you right out of your mind
But I know when I do I won't get over you for quite sometimes
I'm aching to hold you... <start> There's a ship out on the ocean at the mercy of the sea
It's been tossed about lost and broken wandering aimlessly
And God somehow you know that ship is me
'Cause there's a light house in a harbor shining faithfully
Pouring its life out across the water for this sinking soul in the sea
That someone out there still believes in me
On a prayer in a song I hear your voice and it keeps me hanging on
Oh raining down against the wind I'm reaching out
'Til we reach the circle's end when you come back to me again
There's a moment that we all come to in our own time in our space
For all that we've done we can undo if our heart's in the right place
On a prayer in a song I hear your voice and it keeps me hanging on
Oh raining down against the wind I'm reaching out
'Til we reach the circle's end when you come back to me again
And again I see my yesterdays in front of me unfolding like a mystery
Your changing all that is and used to be
On a prayer in a song I hear your voice and it keeps me hanging on
Oh raining down against the wind I'm reaching out
'Til we reach the circle's end when you come back to me again
When you come back to me again <start> Everybody's doing a brandnew dance now

I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now

My little baby sister can do it with me
It's easier than learning your ABC
So come on come on do the Locomotion with me
You gotta swing your hips now
Come on baby
Jump up
Jump back
Well now I think you've got the knack
Wow wow
Now that you can do it let's make a chain now

A chuga chuga motion like a railroad train now

Do it nice and easy now don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul
Come on come on
Do the Locomotion with me
Yeyeyeyeah
Move around the floor in a Locomotion

Do it holding hands if you get the notion

There's never been a dance that's so easy to do
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue
So come on come on do the Locomotion with me

You gotta swing your hips now

That's right 
You're doing fine

Come on babe

Hmhmhm jump up

Jump back 
You're looking good

Hmhmhm jump up

Jump back  <start> Oh oh deep water black and cold like the night
I stand with arms wide open
I've run a twisted line
I'm a stranger in the eyes of the Maker
I could not see for the fog in my eyes
I could not feel for the fear in my life
From across the great divide In the distance I saw a light
Of Jean Baptiste's he's walking to me with the Maker
My body my body is bent and broken by long and dangerous sleep
I can't work the fields of Abraham and turn my head away
I'm not a stranger in the hands of the Maker
Brother John have you seen the homeless daughters
Standing there with broken wings
I have seen the flaming swords
There over east of Eden
Burning in the eyes of the Maker
Burning in the eyes of the Maker
Burning in the eyes of the Maker
Oh river rise from your sleep
Oh river rise from your sleep
Oh river rise from your sleep <start> It was tiger Wilson versus Kid McCoy
In the summer of ninetythree
Now the Kid was everybody's pride and joy
Just as game as a Kid could be
And his darlin' Bess was in the second row
She was prayin' with all her might
Sayin' Kid we need that little bungalow
Oh you've just gotta win tonight
Come on Kid come on Kid
Let's hit him with a left and the right
Go on Kid go on Kid
But how were they to know it was the Kid's last fight
But how were they to know it was the Kid's last fight
Now the Kid had fever to the very bone
But nobody would ever guess
He was in there fightin' on his heart alone
'Cause he just had to win for Bess
Oh the Kid was battered the Kid was floored
But the count never got to ten
Though his brain was reelin' when the people roared
He was up on his feet again
Come on Kid come on Kid
Let's hit him with a left and the right
Go on Kid go on Kid
But how were they to know it was the Kid's last fight
But how were they to know it was the Kid's last fight
Said the tiger scowlin' Don't you know you're through
I can whip you just like a child
I'm gonna take the fight and take your woman too
When he heard that the Kid went wild
Said the Kid for that I'll tear you limb from limb
And he sprang like an angry colt
He said a punch a flyin' at the tiger's chin
Knocked him out like a thunderbolt
Come on Kid come on Kid
Let's hit him with a left and the right
Go on Kid go on Kid
But how were they to know it was the Kid's last fight
But how were they to know it was the Kid's last fight
To the crowd that saw it there was little doubt
That the Kid was a champ that night
But the champ would never have another bout
It was the fever that won the fight
Gather round I'm bettin' even money folks
There's a bell soundin' way up high
And the champ is climbin' through the golden ropes
Of the big ring up in the sky
Come on Kid come on Kid
Let's hit him with a left and the right
Go on Kid go on Kid
But how were they to know it was the Kid's last fight <start> 

Well it's only gonna be about an hour friend
'Til they dam your favorite river
So you can waterski just one more reservior
And them supersonic ships are gonna take you
'Cross a sea of pavement
To one more faceless brickyard on the shore
Yeah it's only gonna be about an hour or so
'Til they rip off all your mountains boy
And that one last tired old eagle bites the sand
And all of that highandmighty scenery's
Gonna be leveled to the ground boy
By a bunch a' them mindless strip mines on the land

So listen well my brothers
When you hear the night wind sigh

They'll take away our soul
Well it's only gonna take about a minute or so
'Til the junkyards fill the prairies boy
And them smokin' yellow grass fires start to burn
And the warnings on them beer cans
Gonna be buried in them landfills
No deposit no sad songs and no returns
Yeah it's only gonna take about a minute or so
'Til the factories block the sun out
You gonna have to turn your lights on just to see
And them lights are gonna be neon sayin'
Fly Our Jets To Paradise
And the whole damn world is gonna be made of styrene

So listen well my brothers

And you see the wild goose flying
Through the gray polluted sky

There won't be no rock 'n' roll
'Cause when they take away our country
They'll take away our soul
Yeah it's only gonna be about a second boy
'Til they take away all'a this country
And they'll tell you not to listen to this here song
And that faroff sound of freedom's
Gonna be an echo from the past
And the final tune is gonna be sad and long
And it's only gonna be about an eyeblink boy
'Til they pull out the wool to blind us
So we just can't read all the messages on the wall
But the only words that matter
Oughta be scribbled all over them billboards
In big old black and bloody letters ten feet tall
Chorus
THERE WON'T BE NO COUNTRY MUSIC
THERE WON'T BE NO ROCK 'N' ROLL
'CAUSE WHEN THEY TAKE AWAY OUR COUNTRY
THEY'LL TAKE AWAY OUR SOUL
There won't be no country music
There won't be no rock 'n' roll

What if you are the one that I'm meant to love what if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love dont come twice
And girl take a chance time is unfolding
We could be blessed without even knowing just for a minute
Close your eyes and dont take another breath
Cause what if you miss it and it never comes again
And what if you dont say whats on your minds and I walk away
You might live out your lives and never feel this way
What if I'm the one that you're meant to love and what if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love dont come twice
I dont wanna wake up by myself
Years from now wishin that Id told you what I felt
Your eyes are a window to your soul
If you dont open up I may never know
What if we dont say whats on our minds and we walk away
We might live out our lives and never feel this way
What if I am the one and you are the one what if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love dont come twice
Oh girl what if you are the one and I am the one

Kinda corky everything I'm not
Chorus
She's so unordinary
So unpredictable its scary
And I think I've got more than what I bargained for
But I keep coming back for more of it
Cause I love it
She's got two tattoos
One's on her back
And I ain't saying where the other ones at
Yea but I love it
She don't own a dress
But she's a beauty queen
Takes glamor shots in cut off jeans
And I love it
But if there's one thing that I love the most
Its how she does exactly what I think she won't
Chorus x <start> If she seems cold and bitter I beg of you
Just stop and consider all she's been through
Don't be quick to condemn her for things she might say
Just remember life turned her that way
She's been walked on and stepped on so many times
And I hate to admit it but the last footprint's mine
She was crying when I met her she cries harder today
So don't blame her life turned her that way
 piano 
She's been walked on... <start> I CAN'T REMEMBER

RECORDED BY CONNIE SMITH
It was late and I was sleeping when he called
And I can't remember much he said at all
Just that he was leaving town and must get off the phone
I can't remember when he told me he'd be home
Did he say Sunday noon or one day soon
I think he left with them but what if he said am
Did they go to meet the train or leave to catch a plane
I can't remember but I can't forget he's gone
So I telephoned his house and asked his mom
If she'd knew where her little boy had gone
I know she must have told me and I heard her loud and clear
But I can't remember anything but tears
Did she say fishing trip or he gave you the slip
Is he off to see the world or to see antoher girl
Did she say he took the car or what a fool you are
I can't remember but I can't forget he's gone
I can't remember but I can't forget he's gone <start> I won't forget the day I found
My first place on the edge of town
A few milk crates a beatup couch and an old T.V.
A little rundown a little bit small
But to me it was the Taj Mahal
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
Friday night what the hell let's go
And just like that we were on a roll
Three best friends and a radio that was all we'd need
We put a thousand miles on an old red jeep
Just to watch the sun rise on the beach
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
When you're young
There's plenty of time to get older
Once you're old
That's all you'll ever be
Yeah that's the beauty to livin' life
Wild and free
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
I left home around 
Mama was beggin' me to finish school
But there was nothing they could do it was up to me
So I packed my bags and an old guitar
'Cause if you're ever gonna be a star
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
When you're young
There's plenty of time to get older
Once you're old
That's all you'll ever be
Yeah that's the beauty to livin' life
Wild and free
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
So grow your hair get a new tattoo
Quit your job and go to Bonnaroo
Whatever it is you wanna do
Or think or be
Don't put it off too many years
'Cause some of the best stuff disappears
I ain't old enough to know but I believe
Yeah there's some things you gotta be young to see <start> Well I won't make you tell me
What I've come to understand
You're a certain kind of woman and
I'm a different kind of man
I've tried to make you love me
You're tried to find a spark of the flame that burned and
Somehow turned to smoke ring in the dark
The loneliness within me
Takes a heavy toll
'Cause it burns as slow as whiskey through an empty aching soul and
The night is like a dagger
Long and cold and sharp
As I sit here on the front steps
Blowing smoke rings in the dark
I I I know I must be going
'Cause loves already gone and
All I'm taking with me are the pieces of my heart and
All I'll leave are smoke rings in the dark
The rain falls where it wants to
Wind blows where it will
Everything on earth goes somewhere
But I swear we're standin' still
So I'm not going to wake you
I'll go easy on your heart
I'll just touch your face and drift away
Like smoke rings in the dark <start> I let my heart fall into careless hands
Careless hands that broke my heart in two
You held my dreams like worthless strings of sand
Careless hands don't care when dreams secure
You've brought me joy and oh I loved you so
But all that sunshine didn't make roses grow
If you don't change someday you'll know the sorrow
Careless hands that can't hold on to love
You've brought me joy and oh I loved you so
But all that sunshine didn't make roses grow
If you don't change someday you'll know the sorrow
Careless hands that can't hold on to love <start> Parody of Sold The Grundy County Auction by John Michael Montgomery  Of Music RobbRoy West Music

Sadie pull this car over. Let me get me a can of Skoal.
Well we went down to the Grundy County auction
The sign said no tobaccer where we sat
My wife told me that I should spit with caution
Or else we'll all wind up in a big ol' spat
And I said hush your mouth nobody's gonna mind
If I pack my lip and ignore the sign
'Cause a little dip of Skoal never hurt no one at all
Then I've never seen anyone get so mad
From a little bit of spit on his John Deere hat
But I spit on him once spit on him twice
Spit Skoal on the feller in the second row
Well he turned around and nearly broke my nose
I got a big fat lip two black eyes
Shoulda just went and dipped outside
Well it musta been about eight or nine more minutes
Until I pulled that can of Skoal back out
And I knew when I put my fingers in it
That I'd just spit it out amongst the crowd
...Look out
And you know I really don't care if anybody minds
A pinch 'tween your cheek and gum is not a crime
So I'll do my spittin' and to heck with the rest of y'all
Well I've never saw people gettin' so dang mad
Worst County auction they've ever had
'Cause I spit on 'em once spit on 'em twice
Spit Skoal on the people well I must confess
I even got a little on a lady's white dress
But in the end they got me back you see
They all took a dip and spit on me
Well they pinned me down on the auction block
And took my Skoal away
And the town still hates to talk about
The mess that was made that day
When I said hush your mouth nobody's gonna mind
If I pack my lip and ignore the sign
'Cause a little dip of Skoal never hurt no one at all
Well I've never saw people gettin' so derned mad
The worst County auction they've ever had
'Cause I spit on 'em once spit on 'em twice
Spit Skoal on the people well I must confess
I even got a little on a lady's white dress
Shoulda swallowed my dip swallowed my pride
Shoulda just went and spit outsiiiiiiide.
Whew
Boy that was horrible

Well I went down to a Music City function
Where I just heard a song that I had to howl out
My lawyers told my to proceed with caution
Or I'd make a whole lot of songwriters mad
Uhhuh
And I said
Hey John Michael Montgomery won't mind
If I take a song and make it mine all mine
Like I did so many times with old Tim McGraw's
Yeah I never heard anything sound so fine
Mind if I borrow one or two of your lines
Well I stole it once stole it twice
I STOLE it from a writer on Music Row
Well he just moved to town and he didn't know
About ASCAP SESAC or BMI
So he might as well kiss his song goodbye
I had my number two pencil going about a mile a minute
Till I had his ideas all written down
And I knew I really went and did it
When the police came and hauled my butt downtown
And I said
Hey John Michael Montgomery won't mind
If I steal a song and make it mine all mine
Like I did so many times with Tim McGraw's
Yeah I never heard anything sound so fine
Mind if I borrow one or two of your lines
Well I stole it once stole it twice
I STOLE that song and I must confess
When I went to court I plead no contest
Got a big fat lip and two black eyes
Never should have messed with his copyright
Yeah
I told the judge I had writers block but he hauled my butt away
And now it hurts too much to laugh about the song I stole that day
When I said
Hey John Michael Montgomery won't mind
If I steal a song and make it mine all mine
Like I did so many times with Tim McGraw
Yeah I never heard anything sound so fine
Mind if I borrow one or two of your lines
So I stole it once stole it twice
I STOLE it from a writer on Music Row
Well he just moved to town and he didn't know
About ASCAP SESAC or BMI
So he might as well kiss his song goodbye

EYE
STOLE
WHEE <start> Looking out my front door
in the morning
I see the light
Afternoon I'm
in the backyard
passing the time
And when I've said
goodbye to sunshine
I call on some of my friends
See you soon
under the moonlight
And something's moving
outside of my house
in the night
It could be the whistle of the breeze
or some wildlife
but we are alright
Drinking our tea
tucked in the bed sheets
I'll dream in melody
How about you
What will you do
Oh maybe
mother and father
still see the light
But when they can't
sit in the sunshine
they call on each other
See you soon
under the moon
I'll see you soon
under the moonlight <start> Look at your window a thousand miles away
Look at your window a thousand miles away
And you will see me and see that I am true
A thousand lonely days a million sleepless nights won't stop my love for you
I remember the sad times I had to go from you
You said think of me often and every time you do
Look at your window
Yes I do think of you often it always brings me tears
And whenever I get lonely your gentle voice I hear
Look at your window
A thousand lonely days a million sleepless nights won't stop my love for you <start> I'd walk for miles cry or smile for my mama and daddy
I want them I want them to know
How I feel my love is real for my mama and daddy
I want them to know I love them so
In my heart joy tears start cause I'm happy
And I pray every day for mom and pappy and each night
I'd walk for miles cry or smile for my mama and daddy
I want them to know I love them so
I'd fight in wars do all the chores for my mama and daddy
I want them to live on till they're called
I'd work and slave and never rave to my mama and daddy
Cause I know I owe them my all
In my heart joy tears start
Yes I want them to know I love them so <start> Well why don't you love me like you used to do
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
Why don't you love me like you used to do
Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin' in a long long while
We don't get nearer or further or closer than a country mile
Why don't you spark the way you used to do
And say sweet nothings like you used to coo
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do
Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin' in a long long while
We don't get nearer or further or closer than a country mile <start> Would you be free from the burden of sin
There's power in the blood power in the blood
Would you o'er evil a victory win
There's wonderful power in the blood
There is power power wonderworking power
In the blood of the Lamb
There is power power wonderworking power
In the precious blood of the Lamb
Would you be free from your passion and pride
There's power in the blood power in the blood
Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide
There's wonderful power in the blood
There is power power wonderworking power
In the blood of the Lamb
There is power power wonderworking power
In the precious blood of the Lamb
Would you be whiter
much whiter than snow
There's power in the blood power in the blood
Sin stains are lost in its lifegiving flow
There's wonderful power in the blood
There is power power wonderworking power
In the blood of the Lamb
There is power power wonderworking power
In the precious blood of the Lamb
There is power power wonderworking power
In the blood  of the Lamb 
There is power power wonderworking power
In the precious blood of the Lamb <start> Well I was out a drinking with a couple of friends of mine
When the bartender handed me the telephone
And said there's my wife on the line
Well I told her I was just a drinking with the couple of biddies I knew
But she told me in a few short words just what she wanted me to do
She said won't you come home and talk to a stranger
You might even make yourself a friend
So won't you come home and talk to a stranger
It's the only place in days you haven't been
 piano  guitar 
Well I sat there about an hour a talking with the rest of the guys
When she walked to that front door she had gethome in her eyes
She said you've talked and danced with every woman in town but me
If you just come around the house you might like my company
She said won't you come home...
It's the only place in days you haven't been <start> 
Your love's as fresh in my memory as this morning's sunrise
And still just as beautiful to me
I can still feel the soft touch of love sweet and tender
You give me love to remember
Nights with no ending filled with love I'm remembering
Each night that I spend with you
I can still feel your soft touch I can still feel your warm love
You give me love to remember
And each morning when I wake up
Before I leave my pillow. I search through my dreams carefully
Just to make sure that I don't leave one tiny memory
'Cause I dream of the love I remember
Nights with no ending filled with love I'm remembering
Each night that I spend with you
I can still feel your warm love I can still feel your soft touch
You give me love to remember
Love to remember <start> When a lonely boy meets a lonely girl that's togetherness
Before I met you my whole world was blue that's loneliness
But love conqures all makes big trouble small and even up the score
Togetherness makes loneliness walk right out the door
 that's togetherness
 that's loneliness

Togetherness makes loneliness walk right out the door
Togetherness makes loneliness walk right out the door <start>  it'll be easy  it'll be easy
All you have to do is say our love can't be that's enough for me
 tell me it's over  hurt me all over
If you want to break my heart it'll be easy
I can tell you're searching hard to find a way to say we're through
You're trying not to be unkind so I'll make it easy for you
Just say that you don't love me it's better not to lie
But let me keep the memory when you say goodbye
 it'll be easy
If you want to break my heart it'll be easy <start> Another day
I spend alone
Here lately
I cry and moan
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember
Early mornin's
I just suffer through Since feelin' empty's
What I'm bound to do
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember
When every choice filled with regret Even though they haven't yet
Make her thoughts surrender
Then she'll remember
Late afternoon
I curl up tight To fight back tears I'll shed all night
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember
Be no debatin' right or wrong
It's just a matter of how long
Those lies degend her
Then she'll remember
She'll try she'll try
But there won't be
No more escape
From her own lonely memories
Mine may be
The only scars that show
From every break
One heart could know
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember
Once all that's left is what's been used
And any chance to hide from the truth
Keeps gettin' slimmer
Then she'll remember
So one more day
I'll spend alone
Like every other
I cry and moan
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember
The early mornin's
Late afternoons
Each empty night
I'm still sufferin' through
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember
When every choice filled with regret
Even though they haven't yet
Make her thoughts surrender
Then she'll remember <start> Baby dry your eyes
There's no need to cry
'Cause I'll see you again
It might be a while
Before you understand
Chorus
I'm just away down the river
A hundred miles or more
Crossing over Jordan
To the other shore
I'll be standing waiting
With all who've gone before
I'm just away down the river
A hundred miles or more
Now the pictures on the wall
Will help you to recall
They're not there
To make you sad
But to remember
All the good times we had
Chorus
When it's time to leave
You're gonna feel the mountain breeze
And the snow will fill the stream
And carry you to me
Chorus <start> When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more
And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair
When the saved word shall gather over on the other shore
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
On that bright and cloudless morning
When the dead in Christ shall rise
And the glory of his resurrection share
When His chosen ones shall gather
to their home beyond the skies
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there <start> If your soul was veiled in darkness and you had no grief nor care
'Twould be better than the Master for the cross He had to bear.
Chorus
Then take courage un' tomorrow all the clouds will pass away.
Live in trust and faith believing then there'll come a happy day.
Cling to Christ and trust Him ever 'til the shadows flee away
Then your soul shall shall see the dawning of a bright eternal day. <start> 
I used to sit for hours as a kid
Dangle my feet from an old flat bridge
Seein' myself in the water below
Shatter my image with the stones I'd throw
I recall a vacant old shack
Down by the edge of the tobaccer patch
A child's reflection in a dirty window
Shatter my image with the stones I'd throw
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
They shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones they throw
I'm far from perfect but I ain't all bad
It hurts me more than it makes me mad
You gather your stones by stoopin' so low
Then shatter my image with the stones you throw
If you live in a glass house don't throw stones
Don't shatter my image 'til you look at your own
Look at your reflection in your house of glass
Don't open my closet if your own's full of trash
Stay out of my closet if your own's full of trash
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
They shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones they throw
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
They shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw
Don't shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw
You shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw
You shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw
You shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw
You shatter my image with the stones you throw <start> Once more to be with you dear
Just for tonight to hold you tight.
Once more I'd give a fortune
If I could see you once more.
Forget the past. This hurt can't last.
No I don't want it to keep us apart.
Your love I crave. I'd be your slave
If you'd just ive me all of your heart. <start> I'm looking for that Lonely Street I've got a sad sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep where's this place called Lonely Street
A place where there's just loneliness where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet where's this place called Lonely Street
Perhaps upon that Lonely Street there's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams and watch an old love die
A place where there's just loneliness where dim lights bring forgetfulness
I need a place to go and weep where's this place called Lonely Street
Where's this place called Lonely Street <start> You don't know how it feels but someday you will
At the moment you can't see what you're doing to me
You don't know how I feel but someday you will
It don't mean a thing to you all this hurt I'm going through
You don't know how it feels but someday you will
Someday you're gonna know what it's like to be blue
When the one you're hurting me for gets around to hurting you
Right now you can't visualize tears like mine in your eyes
You don't know how they feel but someday you will
 steel 
Someday you're gonna know...
You don't know how they feel but someday you will <start> Sure feels like love the best I remember
Sure feels like love the best I recall
It's so good it feels like the first time I reached out
And really went for it all
Sure feels like love 'cause I don't remember
The last time that love felt this strong
So you're either gonna have to stop what you're doin' to me right now
Or you're gonna have to keep doin' it all night long
You're drivin' me crazy and you may even try
I know you're a lady there's no way of denyin'
I don't remember the last time love felt this strong
So you're either gonna have to stop what you're doin' to me right now
Or you're gonna have to keep doin' it all night long
Sure feels like love the best I remember
Sure feels like love the best I recall
It's so good it feels like the first time I reached out
And really went for it all
Sure feels like love 'cause I don't remember
The last time that love felt this strong
So you're either gonna have to stop what you're doin' to me right now
Or you're gonna have to keep doin' it all night long
You're either gonna have to stop what you're doin' to me right now
Or you're gonna have to keep doin' it all night long <start> Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day
I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin
Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way
On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down
In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing
Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday
On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down <start> They passed an ordinance in the town they said we'd have to tear it down
That little old shack out back so dear to me
Though the health department said its day was over and dead
It will stand forever in my memory
Don't let them tear that little brown building down
Don't let them tear that precious building down
Don't let them tear that dear old building down
There's not another like it in the country or the town
It was not so long ago that I went tripping through the snow
Out to that house behind my old hound dog
Where I would sit me down to rest like a snowbird on his nest
And I'd read that Sears and Roebuck catalog
Oh I would hum a happy tune peeping through the quarter moon
As my daddy's kin had done so much before
It was in that quiet spot daily cares could be forgot
And it gave the same relief to rich and poor
Don't let them tear...
Now it was not a castle fair but I could dream of future there
Build my castle to the yellow jackets drone
I could orbit round the sun fight with General Washington
Or be a king upon a golden throne
It wasn't fancy built at all we had newspapers on the wall
It was airconditioned in the wintertime
Oh it was just an humble hut but its door was never shut
And a man could get inside without a dime
Don't let them tear... <start> WOODEN HEART
Writers Benjamin Weisman Fred Wise Kay Twomey Bert Kaempfert
Can't you see I love you Please don't break my heart in two That's not hard to do 'Cause I don't have a wooden heart And if you say goodbye Then I know that I would cry Maybe I would die 'Cause I don't have a wooden heart There's no strings upon this love of mine It was always you from the start Treat me nice Treat me good Treat me like you really should 'Cause I'm not made of wood And I don't have a wooden heart <start> This ol' smoke filled bar is somethin' I'm not used to
But I gave up my home to see you satisfied
And I just called to let you know where I'll be livin'
Well it's not much but I feel welcome here inside
And I've got swinging doors a jukebox and a barstool
And my new home has a flashing neon sign
Stop by and see me anytime you want to
'Cause I'm always here at home till closing time
I've got everything I need to drive me crazy
I've got everything it takes to lose my mind
And in here the atmosphere's just right for heartaches
Thanks to you I'm always here till closing time
And I've got swinging doors a jukebox and a barstool
And my new home has a flashing neon sign
Stop by and see me anytime you want to
'Cause I'm always here at home till closing time <start> Flooded roads out of town
Call and telephone lines are down
I call and the lines are down
Retarded girl oh she slurs
Tornadoes out on the desert sir
Tornadoes out on the desert
And I'm going to El Paso
I'm going to El Paso
I'm going to El Paso
I'm going to
Chicken blood on my pants
My Hands are shaky and pillow is damp
My Hands are shaky and pillow is damp
Cigarette on a rumble seat
Drive all day got nothing to eat
I'm Driving all day got nothing to get me to El Paso
I'm going to El Paso
I'm going to El Paso
I'm going to
Look out Juarez
I gonna dance with the Strawberry girl
I'm gonna dance with the Strawberry girl
Green shirt muddy shoes
Waiting on the bus to get me through
I'm waiting on the bus to get me to goin to El Paso
I'm going to El Paso
I'm going to El Paso <start> Precious mem'ries unseen angels sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger ever near me as the sacred past unfolds
Precious mem'ries how they linger how they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious father loving mother fly across the lonely years
And the old home scenes of my childhood in fond memory appear
Precious mem'ries how they linger... <start> Gotta find out who's a callin' you when it ain't me a callin'
Gotta put a stop to your stallin' then maybe I can get some sleep
Gonna engage Dick Tracy I might retain Perry Mason
To investigate this situation then maybe I can get some sleep

Has someone been a stealing my sugar has someone been a singing my song
Has there been a hand in the cookie jar has someone been a eatin' my honeycomb
Gonna get you down to the courthouse I'm sick and tired of bein' a manmouse
I'll get us a licence to keep house then maybe I can get some sleep
 guitar 
Has someone been a stealing...
We'll get us a licence to keep house then maybe we can get some sleep
 <start> I'm the center of attention in this bar room
'Cause I've got the biggest heartache of the year
And each night those swingin doors reach out to me and draw me in
'Cause they know each night that I'll be back to wine me up again
Chorus
Wine me up turn me on and watch me cry for you
Lately drinkin' warm red wine is all I want to do
I never know how tight I'll wine me up 'til I walk in
I don't care cause I'll be back to wine me up again
I'd like to thank the folks who raise the grapes way up in California
And I'm hopin this will be their biggest year
'Cause scarlet waters all that's left to keep me hangin' on
That's why I'll try to wine me up each day and night next year <start> Little girls and little boys
Dream of worlds full of toys
This time of the year
When Christmas is near
And evergreens are snowy white
Sleigh bells ring through the night
This time of the year
When Christmas is near
And somewhere near a steeple
People kneel and pray
And choirs sing carols
Of Christmas Day
Santa Claus is on his way
With loads of joy on his sleigh
This time of the year
When Christmas is near
When Christmas is near
Oh Santa Claus is on his way
With loads of joy on his sleigh
This time of the year
When Christmas is near <start> I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams <start> let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
while we all sup sorrow with the poor
there's a song that will linger forever in our ears
oh hard times come again no more
'tis a songa a sigh of the weary
hard timesa hard times come again no more
many days you have lingered around my cabin door
oha hard times come again no more
while we seek mirth and beauty
and music light and gay
there are frail ones fainting at the door
though their voices are silent
their pleading looks will say
oh hard times come again no more
'tis a songa a sigh of the weary
hard times... hard times come again no more
many days you have lingered around my cabin door
oh hard times come again no more
'tis a sigh that is wafted across the troubled wave
'tis a wail that is heard upon the shore
'tis a dirge that is murmured around the lowly grave
oh hard times come again no more
'tis a songaa sigh of the weary
hard timesa hard times come again no more
many days you have lingered around my cabin door
oh hard times come again no more
oh hard times come again no more <start> With your love I was complete
Like a haven safe from harm
Till the bitter stole the sweet
I was perfect in your arms
A precious while I had your smile
Till it all fell apart with one change of heart
The pain and regret will fade but a fact of love will still remain
You can't always trust happiness
Love like a sweet parade till the saddest part when the music fades
You can't always trust happiness
If a single star I see
Ever made a wish come true
It would bring you back to me
But the best my heart can do
Is to love again I don't know when
Still it's worth all I fear the heartaches and the tears
Love like a lesson learned when we pass the point of no return
You can't always trust happiness
There in love's steady glow hides the power to hurt us so
You can't always trust happiness <start> Hurt is no stranger to me
And oh how well I know misery
You always hurt me and I always forgive
And I'll hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live
Oh it's my fault for loving you so deeply
I give you my love completely
I give you love but hurt is all you give
And I'll hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live
For as long as I love you there'll be pain
Though tears come and go my love remains the same
I'll always forgive you yes you know that I will
And I'll hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live
Yes I'll hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live <start> Shut up and drive you don't know what you're talking about
He's not the one you ought to know that by now
You've got one of those hearts that keeps changing your mind
Your heart has a way of making you stay so shut up and drive
Don't look in the mirror he might have that look in his eyes
The one that's so strong it strangles your will to survive
He's mastered the art of looking sincere
His eyes have a way of making you stay don't look in the mirror
I'm the voice you never listen to
And I had to break your heart to make you see
That he's the one who will be missing you
And you'll only miss the man
That you wanted him to be
Turn the radio on to drown out the sound of goodbye
Blink back the tears show me you've still got your pride
Just get yourself lost in a sad country song
Those guys that they play know just what to say turn the radio on
I'm the voice you never listen to
And I had to break your heart to make you see
That he's the one who will be missing you
And you'll only miss the man
That you wanted him to be
Shut up and drive
Don't look in the mirror
Turn the radio on
Get out of here
Shut up and drive
Shut up and drive
Shut up and drive <start> I just bought me a great long ticket
I'm gonna use it at  P.M.

And break the news to him
You thought your little romance
Was on the strict Q.T.
So if you want your freedom P.D.Q.

To hear you cry

And by and by
You can reach me down in Dallas
A general delivery
So if you want your freedom P.D.Q.
Divorce me C.O.D.
There's gonna come a day girl
When you'll be feelin' blue

This dynamite you're playin' with
May be T.N.T.
So if you want your freedom P.D.Q.
Divorce me C.O.D.

Down on your knees
'Cause I all I know

So if you want your freedom P.D.Q
Divorce me C.O.D <start> Your lonely nights are over for there's someone new
And he doesn't neglect you like I used to do
Once again you're smiling once again life is fun
Yeah your lonely nights are over and mine have just begun
In a far away city where I lingered a while
I kept thinkin' about you of your eyes and your smile
I decided I love you and came back yesterday
Now I find that your teardrops washed your love from me away
Oh your lonely nights are over <start> Well I knew at the moment when I saw you
I could feel you close to me across the room
Last night oh all right
I found you
What went down there I knew could never leave me
It was that feeling girl I got from you
Last night oh all right
I found you
It's been much too easy to remember sometimes
How empty handed loneliness can be
But when you were there to ease my mind
There was so much of something that I need
All the changes in the places at the time when
You were there and then at once I was with you
Last night oh all right
I found you
Last night I said all right
I found you <start> I'll bet you the wine is fine
And I'll bet you the diamonds are real
And I'll bet you his house is a big one
Up on the hill
Hey that's where he's got me girl
And not that I blame you at all
Now don't say you're sorry
Just go and have you a ball
'Cause I ain't got his kind of money
And I probably never will
But I got a buck that says
His twenties and his hundred dollar bills
Ain't gonna satisfy you forever
They can only buy so much
I ain't got his kind of money
But he ain't got my kind of love
Who's gonna bait your hook
Who's gonna get lost in your eyes
Who's gonna throw that ball
That wins you the prize
Yeah who's gonna kiss you good night
Make it last all night long
Yeah who's gonna be there
When he's always gone
No I ain't got his kind of money
And I probably never will
But I got a buck that says
His twenties and his hundred dollar bills
Ain't gonna satisfy you forever
They can only buy so much
I ain't got his kind of money
But he ain't got my kind of love
He can buy you all he wants to
But girl I ain't sold
So keep my number handy
'Cause I think we both know
I ain't got his kind of money
And I probably never will
But I got a buck that says
His twenties and his hundred dollar bills
Ain't gonna satisfy you forever
They can only buy so much
I ain't got his kind of money
But he ain't got my kind of love
I ain't got his kind of money
But you're gonna miss my kind of love
You gonna miss it baby ha
That's right my kind of love <start> I find myself sitting here again
Surrounded by souvenirs
Letters and cards and tearstained photographs
I'm holding matches in my hand
Got a log in the fireplace
All that I need to turn old dreams to ash
But I can't strike that match
I'm not sure I'm over looking back
I tell myself I won't hold on to the past this can't last
But I can't strike that match
Here's one of you and me out west
The Rockies belonged to us
We always said that one day we would return
Here's that written statement of our love
Signed by the county clerk
Just a piece of paper that would easily burn
But I can't strike that match
I'm not sure I'm over looking back
I tell myself I won't hold on to the past this can't last
But I can't strike that match
Holding on is killing me girl I know I need to let go
Just set fire to memories and watch us go up in smoke
But I can't strike that match
I'm not sure I'm over looking back
I tell myself I won't hold on to the past this can't last
But I can't strike that match
No I can't strike that match <start> This street that we live on
Anit no yellow brick road
And this pay check that I bring home
Sure aint no port of gold
When people dream they don't wish they wakeup
They don't know we got more then enough
Somewhere under the rainbow
Watchin the late show and livin on love
Dancin slow to the radio yeah holdin on
Somewhere uder the rainbow
Some folks send there whole life dreamin bout the other side
Well there anit this far that old blue birds fly
But I'll take forever were the skys aren't always blue
Cause when I'm in your arms I know dreams come true
Somewhere under the rainbow watchin the late show
Livein on love and dancin slow to the radio
Just holdin on somewhere under the rainbow
Somewhere under the rainbow yes watchin the late show
And livin on love and dancin slow to the radio
Yeah holden on somewhere under the rainbow <start> I picked last night in Tucson I sang 'em a country song
Missed my plane this morning Lord cause we parted all night long
I'm out here now usin' my thumb tryin' to make it to El Paso
Cause tonight I play at the cabarete they done told it on the radio
To a country singer it's a lonesome road with time hangin' heavy on my hands
If I take a little pleasure and a little bit of love baby that don't makes me all bad
I've been high and I've been low and I've been to San Antone
But the worst by far than I've ever been was when I've been alone
Tomorrow night I'm in Austin I've got some old friends there
Cause there's old Jeff and Willie and Sam and a girl with the long dark hair
To a country singer...
There's one last stop down in Shreveport on this tour of one night stands
And I've got some time but no peace of mind till I'm back on the road again
If my old guitar had learned to talk it'll tell about the things I done
There's a mighty good woman back in big D but never ever let me come home
To a country singer...
If I take a little pleasure and a little bit of love baby that don't makes me all bad <start> Banjo...
I'm from the country you're from the city
I drive a truck you think that's silly
But there's another side of me you know you'd like to see
Ain't that right Oh that's right.
I got my money in my pocket
A girl beside me a little bottle rocket
There's a finger on her lips and a swagger in her hips
Tonight tonight tonight

This party's raging you won't wanna miss
All my buddies turning up parking lot is full of trucks
Hang on tight hang on tight oh my my my
And I say Hey I want you girl
You make my heart heart flutter like a tiltawhirl
It's getting freaky on the floor feel that rumbling sound
I might have grown up in a barn
But I can bring down the house
And we go down down down down
The club goes round round round round
We take it to the ground ground ground ground
Oooh tonight tonight tonight tonight
And we go down down downtown

Sometimes I'm goin' to wonder a keepin' up with my chores
And I might straight just a little too far from my own backdoor
When others biddles tempt me and I'm just about to make the plunge
I can hear mama holler come and get it at the top of the lounge
She's a come and get it mama...
 guitar  harmonica 
She's a come and get it mama...
She's a  and I'm a never have to call me twice man <start> I'll never get out of these blues alive
No I'll never I'll never get out of these blues alive
Well he gone and left me
I don't know what I'll do the rest of my life
Drinking black coffee and smoking cigarettes
Drinking black coffee yeah and smoking cigarettes
I can't see no use to try
I'll never get out of these blues alive
No I'll never I'll never get out of these blues alive
He gone and left me
Says he'll never come back home
I'll never come out of these blues alive
No I'll never I'll never come out of these blues alive
He gone and left me
I don't know what I'll do the rest of my life
Working up a sweat all night long and jumping over my bed
Unverified sweat all night long and jumping over my bed
I can't see no use to try
Well I'll never never come out of these blues alive
I'll never never come out of these out of these blues alive
You know I miss him
Unverified to the day I die
You know I miss him
Unverified to the day I die <start> My world was no more than a dream
And waitin' on a dream can sure get lonely
Your love just fell right into place
And filled and empty space to overflowing overflowing
My world begins with havin' a friend when I'm feeling blue
My world would end if ever I heard you say we were through
Just don't know what I'd do
Cause my world begins and ends with you
Sometimes I tell little lies to see if your eyes are looking through me
But you know lying's not my style
I just need your smile coming to me
Reassuring me
My world begins with havin' a friend when I'm feeling blue
My world would end if ever I heard you say we were through
Just don't know what I'd do
Cause my world begins and ends with you <start> She said I got this hat in California
From a man on the street his name was Joe
Have you ever been to California
Well you really gotta go
She said I knew a boy down in Miami
He was a welder just like you
I love the ocean in Miami
I've never seen anything quite so blue
Chorus
And I'd say
Hey Where are we going today rocket girl
Tell me what life is like past that city limit sign
Dream your dreams in my ear
Baby just get me outta here
Fly me around this world
Rocket girl
She said have you ever been to Alberta
Wheat fields as far as you could see
Have you ever seen the prairies
Someday I'll take you there with me
Chorus
I never tell her she's been busted
I know she's never been anywhere just like me
But it makes her feel like Cinderella
And I get to see the world for free 
I just say
Hey Where are we going today rocket girl
Tell me what life is like past that city limit sign
Dream your dreams in my ear
Baby just get me outta here
Fly me around this world <start> T no meu paladar

Amor que no tem fim <start> Now as I sigh the hours away
I think of love of yesterday
Now I know she's gone away
She's in heaven so they say
Will the angels tell her for me
That my love will never die
Someday I'll walk along beside her
On that golden way up there
Now all my life I lived so gaily
Until she had to go away
Then she left me oh so lonely
She lies at rest beneath the clay
Each night I think about you dear
I wonder if you'll hold me then
When I meet you up in heaven
We'll have life eternal there <start> He's just a singer a natural born guitar ringer
Kind of a clinger to sad old songs
He's not a walkbehinder he's a new note finder
But his name's a reminder
Of a blues man that's already gone
So he started drinkin' took some things that messed up his thinkin'
He was sure sinkin' when she came along
He was alone in the spot light not too much left in sight
She changed all that one night
When she sang him this song
Hey baby I love you Hey baby I need you
Hey baby you ain't got to prove to me
You're some kind of macho man
You've wasted so much of your life
Runnin' through the dark nights
Let me shine a little love light
Down on that blues man
He got so sick from speedin' all the things they said he was needin'
If he was to keep on pleasin' all of his fans
He got cuffed on dirt roads he got sued over no shows
She came and took all that old load
Down off that blues man and he sang
Hey baby I love you too Hey baby I need you
Hey baby I do get tired of this travelin' band
I'm over forty years old now nights would be cold now
If you hadn't stuck it out
With this blues man
He's over forty years old now nights would be so cold now
If she hadn't hung around
With that blues man <start> 
Sittin' on the front porch on a summer afternoon
In a straightback chair on two legs leans against the wall
Watch the kids a' playin' with June bugs on a string
And chase the glowin' fireflies when evenin' shadows fall
In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields near by
Honeysuckle vine clings to the fence along the lane
Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet
And on a distant hilltop an eagle spreads it's wings
An' a songbird on a fence post sings a melody
In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields near by
Walkin' home from church on a Sunday with the one ya' love
Just laughin' talkin' making future plans
And when the folks ain't lookin' you might steal a kiss or two
Sittin' in the porch swing holdin' hands
In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields near by <start> I memorize the note you sent go all the places that we went
I seem to search the whole day through for anything that's part of you
I kept a ribbon from your hair a breath of perfume lingers there
It helps to cheer me when I'm blue anything that's part of you
Oh how it hurts to miss you so when I know you don't love me anymore
To go on needing you knowing you don't need me
No reason left for me to live what can I take what can I give
When I'd give all of someone new for anything that's part of you <start> Kicking up her boots dancing in the front row
Her low rider jeans ride a little too low
The Fire in her eyes ignites when the lights go down
She's got my tour dates posted on her bedroom door
Well the miles are adding up on that old rust bucket Ford
She's out there turning' it on screamin' Turn it up Loud.
Her every move's got me hypnotized
And I'm starting to realize
That I'm in love with a Honky Tonk Groupie
She's kinda young I think her daddy might shoot me
I can't get enough of that Rhinestone cutie
Cause I'm in love in with a Honky Tonk Groupie
Up here on the stage the view sure is fine
That skin tight tube top messin' with my mind
It's everyday spring break and man that girls gone wild
She's got me tripping over every word
I wanna scream it out to the world <start> Almost out of gas and darn I wish I would've asked him
If he's gonna be home late again tonight
Gotta turn these movies in I swear I'm nearin' my wit's end
And Jen your dad said No I'm sorry but that's life
Thinkin' three things at one time
That's what's going on in the mind of this woman
I need to lose ten pounds
Feel like I'm going 'round and 'round in circles
Someone stop this world and let me off
Think I'll call my best friend Sue
Hello hey girl what's new with you
Well I swear if it were me I'd tell him off
Thinkin' three things at one time
That's what's going on in the mind of this woman
Sometimes I wonder if I'm coming or I'm going have to stop
Catch my breath step back and look at where I am
I love my life one minute then I hate like hell I'm in it
But I don't expect myself to understand
Think I'll stop and wash the car grab some lunch and kill an hour
'Cause I gotta pick the kids up after school
Then I drift off to the last time we made love oh it was so fine
There's that laundry list at home I gotta do
Thinkin' three things at one time
That's what's going on in the mind of this woman
Thinkin' three things at one time
That's what's going on in the mind of this woman
Of this woman <start> Chorus 
How she could sing the Wildwood Flower
The orphan girl he would love so long
In the end he knew she'd been his finest hour
And all he has left of her is a song
He first saw her
Standing by a cabin door
Her song was ringing
Out in a voice so strong and sure
To the lonesome valley
He bring her there to be his bride
Where they would live and work together
Side by side
She was his sunshine
She was his moon and morning star
His words would ring to
The chords of her guitar
He was driven
And lost to her for days and days
'Til the lonesome valley
Finally drove her far away
Chorus 
We all cling to
As the years keep rolling on
One single promise
Of a love that's past and gone
And that lonesome valley
We all walk it by ourselves
With the wildwood flower
Is a story we will tell
Chorus 
How she could sing the Wildwood Flower
And all we have left of her is a song <start> Sleepin' on the foldout thanks to me and my big mouth
Why did I do what I did
I shoulda known better than to lie
But it's too late and so tonight I'm
Sleepin' on the foldout sofabed
She wanted me to go and see her family
But I told her that I had to work
I never dreamed she'd get home so dang early
And she caught me cleanin' fish
Out on our back porch

Sleepin' on the foldout thanks to me and my big mouth
Why did I do what I did
I shoulda known better than to lie
But it's too late and so tonight I'm
Sleepin' on the foldout sofabed
I can't believe they call this thing a mattress
It's two a.m. and I'm wide awake
Lookin' back I shoulda just been honest
Instead of tellin' her the whole staff
Spent the day out on the lake
 <start> Well the reindeer pull the sleigh
And the elves make the toys
Those are the stories that are well known to all
Little girls and boys
But I've got another story
That I bet you haven't heard
Did you know that Santa
Has a secret agent bird
He's Penguin James Penguin
That dapper little guy
Like a well dressed duck in a three piece tux
He's Santa's secret spy
Have you ever wondered
How Santa keeps tabs
How he knows when you've been good
How he knows when you've been bad
He's Penguin James Penguin
That dapper little guy
Like a well dressed duck in a three piece tux
He's Santa's secret spy
From an undisclosed location
He's watching me and you
He's got satellite uplinks in his cufflinks
Yeah he sees everything you do
He's Penguin James Penguin
That dapper little guy
Like a well dressed duck in a three piece tux
He's Santa's secret spy
Not so very long ago
Santa didn't need much help
But with more and more kids every year
He soon got overwhelmed
He told the elves one Christmas
We can't do this anymore
Then a knight in shining polyester
Waddled through his door
And it was Penguin James Penguin
He was there to save the day
He had wireless
And GPS outfitted on the sleigh
And Santa said Penguin
Won't you be my ears and eyes
How'd you like to help me run
My SCFBI
He's Penguin James Penguin
And now I guess you've heard
How Santa got his little Christmas
Secret Agent Bird <start> I'm just out of the light
I hadn't caught her eye
But I think I might be lovin' her.
I just stepped outta the door
Gotta be a fool to wanna go one more
For the way were were.
For the good times how many times
I'm losin' track.
Everybody goes everybody knows
that you don't look back.
There's no love in the space I've gained
I could burn my bridges through a pourin' rain.
No matter how far or hard I ride
I can't outrun what I feel inside.
Tell me who do you see
See me running 'round and you think I'm free
From the way we hurt.
I don't mean bodily harm.
When it comes to the heart it's a three alarm
You gotta be alert.
For the good times how many lines
I'm losin' slack.
It's the way it goes everybody knows
and you don't look back.
There's no love in the space I've gained
I could burn my bridges through a pourin' rain.
No matter how far or hard I ride
I can't outrun what I feel inside.
I never mind what I think I know
I'm getting nowhere everywhere I go.
There's no love in the space I've gained
I could burn my bridges through a pourin' rain.
No matter how far or hard I ride
I can't outrun what I feel inside. <start> Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you come back again
You came back but never meant to stay
Now I've got heartaches by the number troubles by the score
Every day you love me less each day I love you more
Yes I've got heartaches by the number a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end
Heartache number three was when you called me
And said That you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited but you must have lost your way
Now I've got heartaches by the number troubles by the score
Every day you love me less each day I love you more
Yes I've got heartaches by the number a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end <start> You wanted to know that you could break my heart but I could have told you you could
You just had to see if I'd go to pieces but I could have told you I would
Just think of the time not to mention the trouble
That you threw away on a heart like mine
If you just have to prove that you could destroy me I could have saved you the time
 steel 
And so now you know that I can be foolish but I could have told you it's true
And so now you see that I have a glass heart but I could have told you I do
There may come a time you may run into trouble
You might find the need for a love like mine
If you're wondering which fool will be waiting for you I could have saved you the time <start> 
Beauty is a rare perfume
Precious yet doesn't last long
Youth is but a playful breeze
That blows our way once then moves on
Love is a hidden treasure
Some never find where it lies
And memory is a little bird
Flies through life live or dies
Little bird
Take me aboard your beautiful wings and let me fly
Fly me away back to yesterday
And drop me off there awhile
Let me smell the rare perfume of the sweet flower of beauty again
Let me run in the playful breeze of youth long gone with the wind
Let me sit for awhile by the place where I found the treasure of love
Then sing me a song as you fly me along on our long last journey above <start> It's been one of those days I can do no right
I can't win for losing try as I might
Yeah I feel walked on like an old doormat
And Lord I hate feeling like that
And though my best laid plans took a slight detour
It ain't just nothing a little love won't cure
Ain't nothing around me tight can't turn around and make all right
So shut that crazy world outside love me back to life tonight
The big dogs are winning that old rat race
I'm licking my wounds here in second place
That boss I got don't cut no slack
He's got a permanent place here on my back
They've been dishing it out but I will endure
It ain't nothing just a little love won't cure
Ain't nothing around me tight
It's been one of these days I should've stayed in bed
I've been gettin' my brains worn out instead
I took it on the chin I took their best shot
But I'll be alright when I'm punching that clock
Cause when I'm back in your arms one thing's for sure
There ain't nothing a little love won't cure
Ain't nothing around me tight
Nothing just a little love won't cure
Nothing just a little love won't cure <start> Behind every good man stands a good woman
Though they might be looking a different way
While she's dealin' with one thing
I've got another thing comin'
If I'm lookin' at tomorrow she'll be thinkin' 'bout yesterday
Back to back we face each other
Still together all alone
We'd be the last to turn to one another
But I know we'll make it together on our own
Nobody could ever come between us
Or force our backs against the wall
Today we're tighter than I've ever seen us
Bending over backwards together we could never fall
Back to back we face each other
Still together all alone
We'd be the last to turn to one another
But I know we'll make it together on our own
Back to back we face each other
But I know we'll make it together on our own <start> There ain't nothing that I would rather see
Than you drying off on this dock
I've been thinking it's so good to be me
But girl on second thought
Wish I could be the beach towel that you laid down on
Or that twopiece that's fitting you so right it's wrong
Or the sunshine kissing on your skin
Wish I could be the lake that you're swimming in
Well I'm hiding behind these RayBan shades
Staring at you like I do
Right here beside you and it's killing me
'Cause I can't get close enough to you
Wish I could be the beach towel that you laid down on
Or that twopiece fitting you so right it's wrong
Or the sunshine kissing on your skin
Wish I could be the lake that you're swimming in
Or maybe that book you laid on your chest
When you drift off like you do
Maybe that twenty five SPF
You keep rubbing all over you
Wish I could be the beach towel that you laid down on
Or that twopiece that's fitting you so right it's wrong
Or the sunshine kissing on your skin
Wish I could be the lake that you're swimming in
Wish I could be the lake that you're swimming in <start> If you gather 'round me people
This story I will tell
About Pretty Boy Floyd the outlaw
Oklahoma knew him well
It was in the town of Shawnee
On a Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in a wagon
And into town they rode
Well the deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language
And his wife she overheard
Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain
And the deputy grabbed his gun
And in the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down
Well they took to the hills and timber
To live the life of shame
And every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name
And he took to the hills and timber
On the Canadian river shore
And Pretty Boy found a welcome
At every farmer's door
Well there's many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid the mortgage
And saved their little homes
Others tell you of a stranger
That comes to beg a meal
And underneath the napkin
He left a thousand dollar bill
Was in Oklahoma City
Was on a Christmas Day
There come a whole car load of groceries
And a letter that did say
Well you say that I'm an outlaw
You say that I'm a thief
While here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief
Well as through this world I've rambled
I've seen lots of funny men
Some will rob you with their sixgun
And some with a fountain pen
But it's through this world you ramble
And it's through this world you roam
You won't never see no outlaw
Drive a family from their home <start> A big moon is risin so bright in the sky
But it won't shine brighter than the stars in your eyes
It rises above me so bright and so blue
And I won't see anyone as lovely as you
Take me into the night
Past these lonely dreams in my heart
I love you more than I can show you
More than I could know in my heart
So lay down beside me and hold me tonight
For your love has found me and it feels so right
These thoughts in my mind are so scattered and few
But I won't see anyone as lovely as you
Take me into the night
Past these lonely dreams in my heart
I love you more than I could show you
More than I could know in my heart <start> It's five days 'til Winter
Four since goodbye
The season s changing
You said so must I
There're scraps in the kitchen
Clothes on the floor
A scarf with your perfume
Still hangs from the door
We dreamed again
Of better than we'd known before
And in the end
Came back to me and you
In the shadows between settling
And wanting more
Are the things that we hope for
And the moments we choose
We made coffee at midnight
Made love until dawn
I never held so tight
As when you were gone
Said we both needed space
Not just down the hall
You found an apartment
I helped paint the walls
And dreamed again
Of better than we'd known before
And in the end
Came back to me and you
In the shadows between settling
And wanting more
Are the things that we hope for
And the moments we choose <start> De que me adianta viver na cidade
Se a felicidade no me acompanhar
Adeus paulistinha do meu corao
L pro meu serto eu quero voltar
Ver a madrugada quando a passarada
Fazendo alvorada comea a cantar
Com satisfao arreio o burro
Cortando estrado saio a galopar
E vou escutando o gado berrando
Saba cantando no jequitib
Por Nossa Senhora
Meu serto querido
Vivo arrependido por ter deixado
Esta nova vida aqui na cidade
De tanta saudade eu tenho chorado
Aqui tem algum diz
Que me quer bem
Mas no me convm
Eu tenho pensado
Eu fico com pena mas esta morena
No sabe o sistema que eu fui criado
To aqui cantando de longe escutando
Algum est chorando
Com rdio ligado
Que saudade imensa do
Campo e do mato
Do manso regato que
Corta as Campinas
Aos domingos ia passear de canoa
Nas lindas lagoas de guas cristalinas
Que doce lembrana
Daquelas festanas
Onde tinham danas e lindas meninas
Eu vivo hoje em dia sem Ter alegria
O mundo judia mas tambm ensina
Estou contrariado mas no derrotado
Eu sou bem guiado pelas
Mos divinas
Pra minha mezinha j telegrafei
E j me cansei de tanto sofrer
Nesta madrugada estarei de partida
Pra terra querida que me viu nascer
J ouo sonhando o galo cantando
O nhambu piando no escurecer
A lua prateada clareando as estradas
A relva molhada desde o anoitecer
Eu preciso ir pra ver tudo ali
Foi l que nasci l quero morrer <start> Well this old world can get you down
And leave you spinning 'round and 'round
Not knowing what's for real
On this crazy wheel
Is part of the deal baby
There's only one sure thing I know
I never want to let you go
I'll be here by your side
On this circus ride
Through every drop and climb
'Til the end of time
When everything is moving fast
It's hard to stay together
I know that we can make it last
We'll find a way to weather
Any storm heaven sends
We'll see it through to the end
We've got it made if you can just believe
You'll always be loved by me
And when you go to bed at night
And I'm not there to hold you tight
I'll love you from afar
No matter where you are
I'll count the days 'til when
I'm with you again
And when we're growin' old
I'll be the one to hold you close
When everything is fading fast
We'll face the end together
We'll find a way to make it past
One final storm to weather
And even after the end
I will be with you again
We've got it made if you can just believe
You'll always be loved by me <start> He's packed up his boots and his saddle
Seventeen headin' out on his own
He'll rodeo from Cheyenne to Texas
Dreamin' of one ride in Vegas
One ride in Vegas
Lonely nights in rundown motel rooms
Achin' bone from yesterday's ride
It's takin' more than he thought he could give it
But he's holdin' on for one ride in Vegas
One ride in Vegas
He's riskin' it all driven by a hunger
That never will let him give up
And with a fire in his eyes he dances with thunder
Till one day his day finally comes
His heart beats fast with anticipation
And brighter lights than the kid has ever seen before
He's waited his whole life for the next eight seconds
And he'd do it all again for one ride in Vegas
This one ride in Vegas <start> There never was a better love
To see the light of day
If only just to lift you up
And rise above the grey
It breaks my heart but now you know
That the broken binds are an open door
And if it all disappears
I promise you I'll still be there
My growing pain my darkest days
I owe them all to you
For every break I've got you to thank
For always pulling me through
If it breaks your heart at least you know
That the broken binds are an open door
And if it all disappears
I promise you I'll still be there
But if the world should let you down
If the sky should fall and never make a sound
Oh if it all disappears
I promise you I will be there
It breaks my heart it breaks my heart
It breaks my heart it breaks my heart
But now you know
That the broken binds are an open door
And if it all disappears
I promise you I will be there
But if the world should let you down
If the sky should fall and never make a sound
Oh if it all disappears
I promise you I will be there
Oh if it all disappears
You have my word I will be there
And if it all disappears
I promise you I will be there <start>  Doyle Holly 
After you leave me after you're gone I'll sit here crying so blue and alone
And when the door closes I'll close my heart too after you leave me what will I do
After you've taken the beat of my heart after you've torn my world all apart
My life will be worthless here without you after you leave me what will I do
 steel 
After you've taken... <start> Well I've been thinking 'bout it an' its been too long
So put them dirty dishes down and leave that laundry alone
Come on
Take me by the hand and follow me to our room
You don't have to tell me this is way over due
I know so lets go
Chorus
I wanna be with you
Come let me kiss you
And I don't mean a peck on the cheek
Girl tonight I'm making up for lost time
I hope you gotta good night sleep
I ain't gonna rush it
Girl you're gonna love it
Cause I intend to do it right
But I'll go ahead and warn ya
This is gonna take all night
Now I don't understand how life can get in the way
Of me and the prettiest girl in the world making love
But it does
Chorus
I wanna be with you
Come let me kiss you
An' I don't mean a peck on the cheek
Girl tonight I'm making up for lost time
I hope you gotta good night sleep
I'm gonna pay attention to every square inch of you
I intend to do this right
But I'll go ahead and warn ya
This is gonna take all night
Yeah I'll show ya how I love ya
But girl its gonna take all night <start> Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time
Thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What I might say
There's a message
In the wild
And I'm sending you
This signal tonight
You don't know
How desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world
I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard
To understand
And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What my friends say
And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What my friends say
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I keep lying to myself
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What my friends say
Ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I keep lying to myself
Ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
Ain't missing you
Oh no
No matter what my friends might say
I ain't missing you <start> Well we know it ain't the first time
We know it used to be my past time
And a couple times back we agreed
That was gonna be my last time
But I guess last night I plum forgot
Who's runnin' this show and who's not
Oh I must've been off of my rocker
I must've got some wires crossed
To come in hear claimin' from here on out
I'm gonna be the boss
Oh it must've been me the big talker
I had a little too much of Johnny Walker
So let's forget about it baby
I must've been off of my rocker
No there ain't no need to stay mad
No need to waste a whole day mad
Though I have to admit honey
You look pretty darn cute mad
Oh baby workin' this out can't be that hard
Hahaha I said I'm gonna be in charge
Oh I must've been off of my rocker
I must've got some wires crossed
To come in hear claimin' from here on out
I'm gonna be the boss
Oh it must've been me the big talker
I had a little too much of Johnny Walker
So let's forget about it baby
I must've been off of my rocker
Oh burn it down now
Yeah I guess last night I plum forgot
Who's runnin' this show and who's not
Oh I must've been off of my rocker
I must've got some wires crossed
To come in hear claimin' from here on out
I'm gonna be the boss
Oh it must've been me the big talker
I had a little too much of Johnny Walker
So let's forget about it baby
I must've been off of my rocker
Yeah let's forget about it baby
I must've been off of my rocker
Oh I'm sorry about that baby <start> Once I had a secret love that lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love became impatient to be free
So I told a friendly star the way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are and why I'm so in love with you
Now I shout it from the highest hills even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door my secret love's no secret anymore
Now I shout it from the highest hills <start> BABY PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON
Writers Bill Anderson Buddy Cannon Paul Overstreet
RECORDED BY TRACY BYRD
Baby put your clothes on put on those brand new shoes
I wanna take you downtown I gotta little blues to lose
I wanna see you dancing swinging to a country song
I love to show you off baby put your clothes on
We been sittin 'round here hardly doin' nothin'
I think we need a little bit of beltbuckle rubbin'
Where the lights are low and the music's fine
Wouldn't hurt us none to have a little you and me time
Baby put your clothes on paint up those pretty lips
Put on those cool blue jeans the ones that ride low on your hips
You know you make their heads turn
Little girl you look so strong
I love to show you off baby put your clothes on
Baby put your clothes on put on those brand new shoes
I wanna take you downtown I got a little blues to lose
I wanna see you dancing swingin' to a country song
I love to show you off baby put your clothes on
We been sittin 'round here hardly doin' nothin'
I think we need a little bit of beltbuckle rubbin'
Where the lights are low and the music's fine
Wouldn't hurt us none to have a little you and me time <start> Three Questions by Bonnie Prince Billy
Say I found a piece of rock
And put it in my pocket
And for the day that we are wed
I put it in a locket
Which is to hang around your neck
As long as you see fit
Well tell me o my love
Do you think that you would wear it
And on the day that threatens
That the earth might open up
The birds have stopped their singing
And the insects have shut up
And all that's left between us
Is some alhomdillillilie
Oh would you split it with me baby
So that I wouldn't die
And after all these things
Is a question I must ask
When everyone has called me out
And said I am the worst
And asked for voices on my side
My love would you sing first
Would you say He's okay
He's better than the rest 
He's innocent in god's eyes
And in mine he is the best <start> You say you're doin' better
For your sake I hope it's true
I wish you well
But that's all that I can do
Save your I'm sorry's
Just leave 'em out the door
You can't make me feel guilty anymore
You say I should stay with you
That Jesus forgives you
You pray I will but I won't
The difference is
Jesus loves you I don't
I know it sounds cruel
And it's really not like me but
You've put me in a place
I never thought I'd be
These tears I'm crying
Are just tears of goodbye
I hope you find someone else
Somewhere in your life
Somewhere in your life
You say I should stay with you
That Jesus forgives you
You pray I will but I won't
The difference is
Jesus loves you I don't
I don't wanna know you still want me
Don't need to hear you can't sleep
No I don't no I don't
You say I should stay with you
That Jesus forgives you
You pray I will but I won't
The difference is
Jesus loves you Oh I know
Jesus loves you I don't <start> OFF AND ON

I broke the link that snapped the chains that bound my heart
I tell the world I'm glad each day you're gone
And people think I'm happy though we're many miles apart
When the truth is I still miss you off and on
Off and on from time to time now and then you cross my mind
I'm not free as the picture I've drawn yes I'm always gonna love you off and on
I'd rather live a lie than not to live at all
But living's more than dying since you've gone
That's why I've retreated here behind this wall
Where I can turn your mem'ry off and on
Off and on...
Off and on off and on off and on <start> music and lyrics by Corb Lund
Family reunion shes gonna be a good one
So lemme bend your ear the clans all here for the family reunion
Well my cowboy uncles sing cowboy songs
And they get drunk and the words get wrong
My Blackfoot cousins say theyre comin this year
Well I hope they do and I hope they bring beer
You got the Mormons and the drinkers and the Mormons who drink
Well pay attention cause it ain't as simple as you think
They say there's some that don't believe in either
But I ain't seen 'em yet and my pa ain't neither
Well then I run into my favourite aunt
And she says Corb you still playin in that band
Well I guess as long as youre havin fun
And you make a little money but were prayin for ya son
Theres a whole lotta cousins that I aint met yet
So you can imagine the shock I get
Theres one of them I think I mighta dated back in school
But thats alright in Alberta thats cool <start> I just got your letter dearest sweetheart
And darlin' I miss you oh so much
Your letter has cheered me but I'm lonesome
Lonesome just to feel your lovin' touch

Letters have no arms dear to hold me
Kisses on paper are so cold
These sweet things you write in your letter
I want to be with you dear when told
Letters never bring me the touch of your hand
Or none of your sweet lovin' charms
I get so lonesome for you darlin'
And you know that letters have no arms
Chorus <start> She's my Texarkana baby do I love her Lowdy Law
Her pappy came from Texas her maw from Arkansaw
I'm twisted round her finger like a little piece of string
And yet I'm satisfied because she's such a precious thing
If she hauled off and slapped me I would never feel the sting
She's my Texarkana baby
She's my Texarkana baby do I love her Lowdy Law
Her pappy came from Texas and her maw from Arkansaw
She's pretty as a picture and you ought to hear her name
It's sweet as sarghum syrup and good ol' blue ribbon cane
She gives me lots of sugar and she never spills a grain
She's my Texarkana baby
She's my Texarkana baby do I love her Lowdy Law
Her pappy came from Texas and her maw from Arkansaw
One night I went a callin' on my pretty little maid
I must admit to you I was a little bit afraid
To offer her a diamond ring with one installment pay
She's my Texarkana baby
She's my Texarkana baby do I love her Lowdy Law
Her pappy came from Texas and her maw from Arkansaw
She's got two eyes that twinkle like a good ol' country star
She's got a perfect figure that'll stop you where you are
Why everytime I look at her I think of my guitar
Se's my Texarkana baby <start> Pair of boots and a sack of clothes
Free and easy down the road I go
Hanging memories on the high line poles
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go
Ragweed's rocking on the radio
Free and easy down the road I go
So I keep rolling like an old banjo
Free and easy down the road I go
Got the sun shining on me like a big spotlight
So I know everything is gonna be alright
Ain't no telling where the wind might blow
Free and easy down the road I go
Living life like a Sunday stroll
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go
If you only get to go around one time
I'm gonna sit back and try to enjoy the ride
I could make a million or wind up broke
Free and easy down the road I go
Can't take it with you when you go so
Free and easy down the road I go
Someday I know it's gonna take me home so
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go <start> IN CASE YOU EVER CHANGE YOUR MIND
Writer Bill Anderson
RECORDED BY CONNIE SMITH

She came down from the mansion on the mountain
She kissed you and she handed you a line
I begged you not to go I said darling don't forget me
In case you ever change your mind
Yes the grass grows greener on the mountain
And the berries grow redder on the vine
But the candle still glows in the window in the valley
In case you ever change your mind
Just in case you ever change your mind and long to hold the love you left behind
I'll be waiting till the end of time in case you ever change your mind

Are the stars any bigger on the mountain is the sun any brighter when it shines
Would comin' back to me be like steppin' down from heaven
In case you ever change your mind
Just in case you ever change your mind...
Just in case you ever change your mind <start> Somewhere someday we'll be close together
Wait and see
Oh by the way
This time the dream's on me
You'll take my hand
And you'll look at me adoringly
But as things stand
This time the dream's on me
Chorus
It would be fun
To be certain that I'm the one
To know that I at least
Supply the shoulder you cry upon
To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be
It can't be true but
This time the dream's on me
Chorus
To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be
It can't be true but
This time the dream's on me <start> A couple of bucks worth in the ashtray
A half of tank of Texaco
You're sitting with your feet on the dash fiddling with the radio
Take a lift at the edge of town out where the roads ain't paved
And if we never find our way back it doesn't matter anyway
 I've been lost since you found me
Head our heart and soul
As long as your arms are around me
It don't matter where we go
I'm right where I always dreamed that I would be
Lost since you found me
We can go to the Oklahoma
Take a swim if it gets too hot
Or have an ice cold coca cola at the whistle stop
I never notice that little white house with a for sale sign
And I've been up and down this road about a million times
 I've been lost since you found me
Head our heart and soul
As long as your arms are around me
It don't matter where we go
I'm right where I always dreamed that I would be
Lost since you found me
Every since you came in sight
I don't know my left from right
Where I start or where you end
Babyall I know is
 I've been lost since you found me
Head our heart and soul
As long as your arms are around me
It don't matter where we go
I'm right where I always dreamed that I would be
Lost since you found me
Since you found me
Lost since you found me
I've been lost since you found me
Ooooo since you found me
Lostlost lost lost since you found me <start> Don't think that I don't see the way you struggle
Watching me struggle
Don't think that I don't feel you turn away
Every time I turn away
And please believe that I believe
When I'm praying
That you're right beside me praying
For the same thing
You're '  born in Carolina
Front pew pretty
And Friday night free
You're dashboard singing
Little red Corvette
Sweet as forgiveness
From the moment that we met
I never knew I had a fighter
I know when you're silent
The silence says more than a scream
And I know when you say that you hate me
It ain't what you mean
When you say that you'll leave and you'll leave
But only for a while
For just a while
You're stubborn and strong
Crazy as New Orleans
Your faded blue denim
A diamond on the town
My tshirt in the morning
Midnight in my hands
At day you're still here I just don't understand
Never knew I had a fighter
Just when I thought I knew everything about you
You're '  born in Carolina
Still front pew pretty
And Friday night free
You're dashboard singing
Little red Corvette
Sweet as forgiveness
From the moment that we met
I Never knew I had a fighter
I Never knew I had a fighter
Please believe that I believe
When I'm praying
That you're right beside me praying
Never knew I had a fighter <start> I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't
Baby I know that you've been wondering
Mmm so here goes nothing
In case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy 'bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know
The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it mmm
There was something 'bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking
One of the things that I've been feeling
Mmm it's time you here 'em
In case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy 'bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know
You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah you're my everything
In case you didn't know
I'm crazy 'bout you
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
Yeah you had my heart a long long time ago
Mmm in case you didn't know
No no in case you didn't know <start> Been forever since I've been gone
Haven't held you in so long
Miss you more than words can say
Guess we've got a little off track
But love knows a way back
Through the storms and pouring rain
Got my hands on the wheel and I'm flying
Heart beat loud as the thunder rolls
Lightning on the stampede of lightning roll
I'm bringing back the sunshine
Bringing back the sunshine
Baby it's about time oh
Every moment every sweet kiss
All the loving that we both missed
It's okay to let em go
Yesterday's all forgotten
And today we start rocking
Somewhere underneath the rainbow
Got my hands on the wheel and I'm flying
Heart beat loud as the thunder rolls
Lightning on the stampede of lightning roll
I'm bringing back the sunshine
Bringing back the sunshine
Baby it's about time oh
Oh yeah bringing back oh
Oh bringing back the sunshine
Baby it's about time oh
Bringing back the sunshine
Baby it's about time oh
Bringing back bringing back
Oh I'm bringing back the sunshine
Baby it's about time oh
Bringing back oh yeah <start> I am sick with wanting
And it's evil and it's daunting
How I let everything I cherish lay to waste
I am lost in greed this time it's definitely me
I point fingers but there's no one there to blame
I need for something
Not let me break it down again
I need for something
But not more medicine
I am sick with wanting
And it's evil how it's got me
And everyday is worse than the one before
The more I have the more I think
I'm almost where I need to be
If only I could get a little more
I need for something
Now let me break it down again
I need for something
But not more medicine
Something has me 
Oh something has me 
Acting like someone I don't wanna be
Something has me 
Oh something has me 
Acting like someone I know isn't me
Ill with want and poisoned by this ugly greed
Temporary is my time
Ain't nothin' on this world that's mine
Except the will I found to carry on
Free is not your right to choose
It's answering what's asked of you
To give the love you find until it's gone
I need for something
Now let me break it down again
I need for something
But not more medicine
Something has me 
Oh something has me 
Acting like someone I don't wanna be
Something has me 
Oh something has me 
Acting like someone I know isn't me
I'll with want and poisoned by this ugly greed
I'll with want and poisoned by this ugly greed <start> When I come to the river at the ending of day
When the last winds of sorrow have blown
There'll be somebody waiting to show me the way
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
Jesus died all my sins to atone
In the darkness I see
He'll be waiting for me
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
Often times I'm weary and troubled and sad
When it seems that my friends have all flown
There is one thought that cheers me and makes my heart glad
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
Jesus died all my sins to atone
In the darkness I see
He'll be waiting for me
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
Though the billows of trouble and sorrow may sweep
Christ the Savior will care for his own
Till the end of my journey my soul he will keep
And I won't have to cross Jordan alone
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
Jesus died all my sins to atone
In the darkness I see
He'll be waiting for me
I won't have to cross Jordan alone <start> These dance hall girls they don't treat you kind
They give you their bodies but you never reach their minds
Well they fill you up with lipstick lies
When they put you down some don't ya be surprised
Is this the way it always is here in Baltimore
Well I saw her mountains and I kissed her plains
I held her sunshine and I drank her rains
Well I went so far that I broke too fast
Thought I had me a winner picked but I came in last again
Is this the way it always is here in Baltimore
I must have chosen the wrong season to come down
I never realized they called this sacred ground
My sense of time hell I'm a week behind
I sent me a letter home but this all takes time
Gonna get some cash gonna go back home
These dance hall girls really know how to make a man feel alone
Is this the way it always is here in Baltimore
My sense of time hell I'm a week behind
I sent me a letter home but this all takes time
Gonna get some cash gonna blow this town
These dance hall girls really know how to drag a poor boy down
Is this the way it always is here in Baltimore
Is this the way it always is here in Baltimore <start> We came out west together with a common desire
The fever we had might've set the west coast on fire
Two months later got trouble in mind
Oh my baby moved out and left me behind
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
The way he left sure turned my head around
Seemed like overnight she just up and put me down
Ain't gonna let it bother me today
I been workin' and I'm too tired anyway
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know
I've been doin' all I can but opportunity sure come slow
Well I'd be in the sun all day
But I'm sweepin' out a warehouse in west L.A.
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know
I've been doin' all I can but opportunity sure come slow
Well I'd be in the sun all day
But I'm sweepin' out a warehouse in west L.A.
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
Yes it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
Yes it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine <start> All day I've faced a barren waste
Without the taste of water cool water
Old Dan and I with throats burned dry
And souls that cry for water
Cool clear water
Keep a movin' Dan don't cha listen to him Dan
He's a devil not a man
He spreads the burning sand with water
Dan can ya see that big green tree
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waitin' there for me and you
The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water
Cool water
But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water
Water water water
Keep a movin' Dan don't cha listen to him Dan
He's a devil not a man
He spreads the burning sand with water
Dan can ya see that big green tree
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waitin' there for me and you <start> It's late in the evening she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her makeup brushes her long blond hair
And then she asks me Do I look all right
I say Yes you look wonderful tonight
We go to a party everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady walking around with me
And then she asks me Do you feel all right
I say Yes I feel wonderful tonight
I feel wonderful
Because I see the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
You just don't realize how much I love you
It's time to go home now I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys she helps me to bed
And then I tell her as I turn out the light
Oh my darling you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling you were wonderful tonight <start> A star fell from heaven right into my arms the brightest star I know I've never seen
Then I found out that it was only you with all your charms
Who came into my life to fill a dream
A fallen star that's what you are the twinkle in your eye came from the sky
You must have strayed from the Milky Way a fallen star that's what you are
The heavens must be lonely now that you are mine
I'm sure they'll miss a star as bright as you
The stars will send their blessings and brighter they will shine
When they see the dream that's coming true
A fallen star that's what you are <start> Merle
Far to sense you'd up and leave that's what you say
Don't you know that the road can run both ways
Bonnie
Well I'm so sure before each other we're all wrong
And I'm tired of always trying to get along
Bonnie  Merle
Well that makes two of us you're not the only one
Like you I've had enough the end has now began
I guess I'm just as tired of you as you say you are of me
And that makes two of us we both want to be free
Bonnie
I'm all through with trying to make the gold of us
And I've given up on giving in so much
Merle
As far as I'm concerned it's over but to pack
I could walk away and never once look back
Bonnie  Merle
Well that makes two of us
And that makes two of us we both want to be free <start> On the country side of heaven
You walk along the emerald brooks
Where the fish are always bitin'
You don't even need a hook nahah
Horses run across the amber
Ain't no fences way up there
Brush the stars on the midway
Of St. Peter's county fair
Whoa an angel plays a southern hymn
On a silver mandolin
Shining in the delta sun
Prayers dance across the prairie
Nothin' there is ordinary
Always with the ones you love
On the country side of heaven
Whoa
On the country side of heaven
Whoa
Kids are jumping off the back porch
Into a cloud up in the sky
Water turns into sweet tea
On the bayou by and by
Whoa an angel plays a southern hymn
On a silver mandolin
Shining in the delta sun
Prayers dance across the prairie
Nothin' there is ordinary
Always with the ones you love
On the country side of heaven
Whoa
On the country side of heaven
I wanna go 
To the country side of heaven

The country side of heaven
On the country side of heaven
Someday that's where I'll be
Singing harmony with Jesus
And when you get there look for me
On the country side of heaven 
Oh  The country side of heaven
Oh 
To the country side of heaven oh 
 The country side of heaven

On the country side of heaven
Whoa
On the country side of heaven
I wanna go
To the country side of heaven
Heaven heaven heaven
Heaven heaven heaven

 <start> 
Ain't it hard when you wake up in the morning
And you find out that those other days are gone
All you have is memories of happiness
Lingerin' on.
You might wonder who can I turn to
On this cold and chilly night of gloom
The answer to that question
Is nowhere in this room.
All your dreams and your lovers won't protect you
They're only passing through you in the end.
They'll leave you stripped of all that they can get to
And wait for you to come back again.
You might wonder who I can turn to
On this cold and chilly night of gloom
The answer to that question
Is nowhere in this room. <start> Don't ever kiss no one but me
If you do dear you'll break my heart
It's not because I doubt you
But I'm such a fool about you
I've got a jealous loving heart
Cause where there's love there's jealousy
Good and bad just won't tear apart
They always go together
Like fair and stormy weather
I've got a jealous loving heart
 guitar 
You're all I want you're all I love
Please don't tear my soul apart
Just say you love me too dear
And be careful what you do dear
I've got a jealous loving heart
Don't ever kiss no one but me... <start> Goodbye so long Fairweather
This time I'm gone forever
I should of seen it coming from a mile away
I guess I wasn't counting on a rainy day
Soon as I could swear the sky was falling down
You were out of ever falling head to ground
Get out of town
Goodbye so long Fairweather
This time I'm gone forever
I'm lighter than a feather
Goodbye so long Fairweather
I'm really like a flower in a hurricane
But sending us a shower wash away my pain
Clouds are blowing over everything is fine
Rainbow on my shoulder in a sweet sunshine
It is all mine
Goodbye so long Fairweather
This time I'm gone forever
I'm lighter than a feather
Goodbye so long Fairweather
Goodbye so long Fairweather
This time I'm gone forever
I'm lighter than a feather
Goodbye so long Fairweather
Goodbye so long Fairweather
Be gone
Goodbye so long Fairweather <start> The strangest thing in all the world is a heart so small
It will just keep right on breaking if you ever let it fall
And I guess I've never known how to solve the mystery
Oh how a thing so tiny could control so much of me
A little bitty love can grow the strongest
A little bitty time away from you can be the longest
Oh how I wish I had never come to know how a little bitty heart can break so big
I wish that I could find a way to get a heart that's new
I would lock it deep inside me just out of reach of you
But I guess there is no way how to solve the mystery
Oh how a thing so tiny could control so much of me
A little bitty love can grow
How a little bitty heart can break so big <start> CHORUSif I said you have a beautiful body would you hold it against me
if I swore you were an angel would you treat me like the devil tonight
if I were dying on thirst would your flowing love come quench me
if I said you have a beautiful body would you hold it against me
Now we could talk all night about the weather
tell you bout my frinds out on the coast
I could ask a lot of crazy questions
or could ask what I really want to know
CHORUS
Now rain can fall soft against the window
the sun can shine so bright up in the sky
but daddy always told me don't make small talk
he said come on out and say what's on your mind <start> I told the whippoorwill told the daffodil just bout your pretty smile
Yes I told them all about you
I told the little bird every single word that you said worthwhile
Yes I told them all about you
I told that big old melody with shine above
How you roll on big blue eyes and how you could love
Each a little honeybee said there's gonna be honeymoon for two
Yes I told them all about you
 ac.guitar 
I told the whippoorwill..
Yes I told them all about you yes I told them all about you <start> Lately things just don't feel right between us
We seldom touch when we turn out the lights
What happened to the me and you that once was
Maybe baby it's time for goodbye
Say goodbye to your daddy and bye to your mama
Lay some rubber on the road in this little blue Honda
Leave the bills and the worry
And the fuss and the hurry behind
We'll spend a few good days under the covers
Talkin' and laughin' and actin' like the lovers
We were before life took over our lives
It's time for goodbye
We can head down the road find a bed and skip the breakfast
Go to Yellowstone and taste some sweet red wine
Hell just say where I'll try to have you there by mornin'
Baby don't you think it's time for goodbye
Say goodbye to your daddy and bye to your mama
Lay some rubber on the road in this little blue Honda
Leave the bills and the worry
And the fuss and the hurry behind
We'll spend a few good days under the covers
Talkin' and laughin' and actin' like the lovers
We were before life took over our lives
It's time for goodbye
Pack a little bag and don't take long
Don't need much more than what you got on
Come on let's get gone
Say goodbye to your daddy and bye to your mama
Lay some rubber on the road in this little blue Honda
Leave the bills and the worry
And the fuss and the hurry behind
We'll spend a few good days under the covers
Talkin' and laughin' and actin' like the lovers
We were before life took over our lives
It's time for goodbye it's time for goodbye <start> Life is like a mountain railroad
With an engineer that's brave
We must make each run successful
From the cradle to the grave
Watch the curves the fills the tunnels
Never falter never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail
Blessed Saviour Thou must guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In Thy grace forever more
Blessed Savior Thou must guide
In Thy grace forever more <start> She's feeling like a new man tonight she's wanting someone else to hold her tight
I can see her eyes all wandering and she has someone in sight
She's feeling like a new man tonight
It's hard to love someone not satisfied
But I'll keep a loving her and just close my eyes
She's thinks that the reality is this slice of life she's feeling like a new man tonight
 steel 
She's feeling like a new man tonight she'll slip out and be gone until daylight
Well it almost drives me crazy when she gets out of sight
And she's feeling like a new man tonight
It's hard to love someone...
Yes she's feeling like a new man tonight <start> Turn the radio up
it's time to get down
Feeling high on the hopes in the wind
Your first lover to love and the lightning above
Taking off to where you've never been
Stick your cares in the air
you can go anywhere
When you're lookin' for the rainbow's end
Follow your nose
you're a rambling rose
And it might be just around the bend
Hang on to your dreams
On that highway 
Live everyday
love it away
There's is a whole world you've never seen
Hang on to your dreams
On that highway 
It's great to be young with a song in your lung
So hang on to your dreams
Let the rhythm roll on
let the wheels go 'round
The sky flying by is your friend
And chasing the blue comes natural to you
So now is the time to begin
Sling your fate to the preeze
You can do what you please
sing it out like a mandolin
Trust in your toes 'cause they knows where they goes
They're just following the feeling within . . .
Hang on to your dreams
On that highway  . . . <start> Honey don't tell the boys that I'm talking like this
'Cause I can't have em thinking I'm scared
The truth is I ain't afraid of nothing no more
I'm tired and I just don't care.
How many tours is too many tours
My baby she'd like to know
Always nagging at the back of my mind is that Jody's there when I go.
Never let them send me back to Sadr City
Never let them send me back
Some shit went down down in Sadr City
Some shit went down in Iraq
I ain't going back.
Well I was there in ' when it first got hot
and Mahdi's local fighters emerged
Earned a purple heart via  and a second later during the surge
Didn't know nothing back then didn't care
It was get it on and kick us some ass
Couldn't tell a Sunni from a Shi'a from the Kurds
But they educated me pretty fast.
Never let them send me back to Sadr City
Never let them send me back
Some shit went down down in Sadr City
Some shit went down in Iraq
I ain't going back.
Well it was pretty touch and go from the very first night
Fiercest action I'd ever seen
Ambush come and we had to dismount
Get busy fighting out in the street.
Well all hell broke loose under fire from the rooftops
Haji launching RPGs
Fighting running battles with militias in the alleys
Dragging on and on week after week.
Taking hits at fifty meters from the Shrine nearby
But they wouldn't let us light up a Mosque
Then our tanks rolled in real hard real heavy
But they couldn't help the guys that we'd lost.
Well I don't know if it matters to the folks back home
But they say they're all supporting the troops
There's no time anyway to be dwelling on that
Out here thinking's only for fools.
And as long as there's no lack of young man willing
To ride to the sound of the guns
I'll be waking up dreaming of the Mahdi Army
And of both sides losing their sons.
They ain't a gonna send me back to Sadr City
They ain't a gonna send me back
My orders came through and babe it isn't pretty
It's Afghanistan instead of Iraq
They're sending me back. <start> Chorus
Oh it's cryin' time again your gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time
Now they say that absence
Makes the heart grow fonder
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
Well my love for you could never grow no stronger
If I live to be a hundred years old
Chorus
Now you say that you've found someone you love better
That's the way it's happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow
Cryin' time will start when you walk out the door <start> I used to see my Daddy every day
He used to race me in the Carolina sun
Back when he was a young man
And he could plow the fields until the day was done
Mama played piano for the choir
Every Sunday afternoon she cooked my favorite things
After church we rode a dozen miles
On old forgotten pathways now overgrown with trees
Chorus Home is not the same place that it was
Time goes by andchanges everything
I left so many things behind me
My favorite things I took away
Were my memories and my dreams
Everything I rode would fly
In the woods by the river and through the fields of hay
Stirring dust and making noise
Across a homemade finish line now lost and gone away
Remember that old dog we used to have
Laying on the front porch when it rained
Sometimes I really miss my old best friend
Buried over in the field where we used to play
Chorus <start> Don't get yourself hit by the fear
Don't set yourself up for the fear
Fear is an opening
Causes an actual tear
Don't buy yourself into the fear
Don't let yourself fall for the fear
Love is the spectacles
Turning the murkiness clear
Fear is a rock in your stomach
Fear is a weight in your heart
Fear is unorganized
Love is the old engineer
Fear it perpetuates heartache
And love is the only relief
Love is the carpenter
Love is the old engineer <start> 
I've walked the streets of loneliness a long long time I know
I've prayed to die a million times because you hurt me so
I didn't think we'd love again the way we did before please don't hurt me anymore
Please don't hurt me anymore don't make me go through what I went through before
Don't make me wonder why I keep knocking on your door
Please don't hurt me anymore
 dobro  steel 
Please don't hurt me...
Please don't hurt me anymore <start> Standing in a field of three leaf clovers
Waiting for the rain to pass over
No rainbows on my shoulder
Just the weight of walking day to day
Nothing shiny coming along the way
Then I saw you and I reached out
 no more blue now I understand why
How lucky I am lucky I am
To be the one who fills your eyes
Blowin' away sails on a lake
Flyin' like a flag in the sky
Bright colored balloons in the wind
That's how lucky I am

Now the road is rising up to meet me
And my half empty cup is filled completely
And I'm drinking that sweet taste of rain
So grateful for each moment I get
To have found you
I could have walked on by
But the stars were on my side <start> Baby I can't believe you I can barely conceive you
Cause baby you're just too good to be true impossible you
Well the Sandman must be scheeming playing games with my dreaming
Cause baby you're just too good to be true
Every morning I rise and shine and then start rockin' and reelin'
Can't seem to keep myself from gettin' this crazy tinglelin' feelin'
If I'm a dreamin' and makin' you up then I don't want anyone wakin' me up
'Cause baby you're just too good to be true
Every since the day I met you I've been workin' on a plan to get you
Cause baby you're just too good to be true sweet lovable you
Well I know that it's not practical fall in love with a miracle
Oh baby you're just too good to be true
Every morning I rise and shine and then start rockin' and reelin'
Can't seem to keep myself from gettin' this crazy knockin' down feelin'
If I'm a dreamin' and makin' you up then I don't want anyone wakin' me up
'Cause baby you're just too good to be true
I'm believable you oh baby you're just too good to be true <start> He was a famous trumpet man from out Chicago way.
He had a boogie style that no one else could play.
He was the top man at his craft
but then his number came up and he was gone with the draft.
He's in the army now. He's blowin' reveille.
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B.
They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam.
It really brought him down because he could not jam.
The captain seemed to understand
because the next day the cap' went out and drafted the band.
And now the company jumps when he plays reveille.
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B.
A root a toot a toodlieadatoot.
He blows it eight to the bar in boogie rhythm.
He can't blow a note unless a bass and guitar
is playin' with him.
And the company jumps when he plays reveille.
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B.
He was some boogie woogie bugle boy of company B.
And when he played his boogie woogie bugle
he was busy as a busy bee.
And when he played he made the company jump eight to the bar.
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B.
Andata toodliatatoodliata toot toot
he blows it eight to the bar.
He can't blow a note if a bass and guitar
isn't with him.
And the company jumps when he plays reveille.
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B.
He puts the boys to sleep with boogie every night
and wakes 'em up the same way in the early bright.
They clap their hands and stamp their feet
'cause they know how it goes when someone gives him a beat.
Woah woah he wakes 'em up when he plays reveille.
The boogie woogie bugle boy of company B.
A root a toot a toodliada to toot toot toot
he's blowin' eight to the bar.
Yeah he can't blow a note if a bass and guitar
isn't woah with him.
And the company jumps when he plays reveille.
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B. <start> Yes I'm hurtin' like I've never hurt before
Well every place I look I see a trail of broken hearts
Bill and Bob and Joe still wear your mark
And everybody's talking bout the things you did to Jim
Oh if this is love please give it back to him
You've got me too upset to weep too wound up to sleep
Waitin' for your knock upon my door
You've got me starin' at the skies chasin' butterflies
Hurtin' like I've never hurt before
 ac.guitar 
Well I've been a lot of places and I've seen a lot of things
Many broken hearts and shattered dreams
I've bragged of many conquest of how love fell at my feet
Oh is this really happening to me
You've got me too upset...
Yes I'm hurtin' like I've never hurt before <start> instrumental <start> I met her at a disco at the school of arts hotel
The kind of place that some girls won't attend
The moon shone over Edward Street and later I could tell
I'd never be a lonely man again.
In Charleville In Charleville there is a pretty little woman who'll says she'll say I will
In Charleville In Charleville there is a pretty little woman who'll says she'll say
I will We're gonna' have a wedding cake that's twenty layers high
Fifteen hundred family and friends
We'll cook ourselves a dozen lambs and drink the district dry
Whip around the hat and we'll start again.
In Charleville In Charleville there is a pretty little woman who'll says she'll say I will
In Charleville In Charleville there is a pretty little woman who'll says she'll say I will
And I've seen girls in Paris to humble any man I've seen earls embarrassed by models in Milan
I've seen enough to know the only girl I need to see is waiting back in Charleville for me. <start> Well they call em' the cheap seats
Yeah right fifty bucks a piece
It's pretty steep for a guy like me.
But it's worth it baby just to see your eyes
Light up tonight 
We can barely even see the band
Out here by the beer stand oh but you don't care
You take my hand say you wanna dance and we're
Swayin' and prayin'
That the band don't ever stop playin'
Our favorite songs all night long.
Oh baby don't it feel so right
Me rockin' you side to side
Just stayin' in these arms of mine
Wrapped up tight just swayin'
They say the shows sold out
And it's one of there biggest crowds.
But all I see is two people right now
Just me and you and all I wanna do
Is never leave this place
With these arms around your waist.
Take a little break for a kiss on your lips.
Been waitin' to long for a night like this just
Swayin' and prayin'
That the band don't ever stop playin'
Our favorite songs all night long.
Oh baby don't it feel so right
Me rockin' you side to side
Just stayin' in these arms of mine
Wrapped up tight just swayin'
I just wanna be close to you
And baby all I wanna do is keep
Swayin' and prayin'
That the band don't ever stop playin'
Our favorite songs all night long.

Just stayin' in these arms of mine
Wrapped up tight just swayin'
Oh girl just prayin'
You'll stay in these arms all night. <start> After seventeen years behind bars
And lookin back on his mistakes
He sat down and poured out his heart
When his son came to see him today
He spoke with a voice that trembled
Tryin to hold back the tears
He said I ain't been much of a father
Son I wish I could turn back the years
Cause life's like a river
And the water is deep
Cross it with care
Or you'll end up like me
Let my mistakes
Be your steppin stones
And walk on the rocks that I stumbled on
He said son stay away from the bottle
Watch out fo the company you keep
And hold on to those you love
Cause love is a man's greatest need
The right way may not be easy
The right road ain't always straight
Son please don't follow the footsteps
That lead to where I am today
Cause life's like a river
And the water is deep
Cross it with care
Or you'll end up like me
Let my mistakes
Be your steppin stones
And walk on the rocks that I stumbled on
Walk on the rocks that I stumbled on <start> I love you but I must live without you I said
And ever since I let you go my world has been dead
I don't know what I had in mind but I know it was wrong
So anytime you're ready come on home
Anytime you're ready this fool has paid enough
Anytime you're ready I really need your love
You don't need to warn me I'm always alone
So anytime you're ready come on home
 guitar 
I could say I'm sorry and beg you to find a way
As a matter of fact dear I'd do it every day
I've got at least a million times since you've been gone
And anytime you're ready come on home
Anytime you're read...
Yeah anytime you're ready come on home <start> Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On a Jupiter and Mars
In other words hold my hand
In other words baby kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words please be true
In other words I love you
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words please be true
In other words in other words
I love you. <start> Excuse my stare
It's only admiration
I cannot hide this infatuation
A young adolescent such an innocent child
You win a contest for every little girl smiled
But all those tears she made you cry cry cry
Let your mama make 'em go bye bye bye
Poor little boy now why why why
Cry baby cry baby cry cry cry
It's not my concern
But my sympathy is yours
And if you're lonely
You can sleep on my floor
I'll lend you an ear or an arm and a leg
But strictly plutonic
For every topic
Heartache's a scratch but love is an itch
She must've scratched you make you hurt like this
Poor little boy now why why why
Cry baby cry baby cry cry cry
You can cry sugar
You can cry honey
You can cry money but don't you cry tears
Cry me a river or cry me a lake
Cry like the rain but don't you ever cry like a train <start> She's ponytailed and she's haltertopped
Her bumber sticker says I hate hiphop
With a southern drawl she says howdy y'all
And her hands ain't afraid of dirt
He's proud of his old truck
He spray painted over dnets and rust
The moto smokes it's got four bald tires but the radio works
Raised ont he good book and out country songs
Ride down back roads singing along
ChorusSo blame me for the way the are
Their love of the fiddle and the steel guitar
Blame me for their cowboy hats
Roper boots wrangler jeans and rifle racks
If you wanna point a finger at somebody for they way they believe
Blame me
They were kids when Hag and me came to town
All eyes and ears look at 'em now
Cneter stage on the Grand Ole Opry on a Saturday night
Sing about fishin' and the Lord above
Fallin' in and out of love
From Aunt Bea to Uncle Sam and the American pie
From big cities to little towns
We're hard core country inside and out <start> I'd give anything to go back
Do anything to go there
To take my breath away again
I still see your face right there
Staring at me and I swear
I can feel you here
When I close my eyes
I know I should drop everything
And run straight back to your side
Maybe I should take a bus ride
Maybe I should put this car in drive
And go find the love that we both used to know
Maybe I can find the one way
Maybe you'll forgive me someday
No red lights stopping me
Nothing gonna slow me down
Starting now
Every step every turn that I take
Every thought every move that I make
Brings me closer to you
If the day is done and I haven't found you
I'll take my love and turn around
Go down another road and try again
Yea try again
Maybe I should take a bus ride
Maybe I should put this car in drive
And go find the love that we both used to know
Maybe I can find the one way
Maybe you'll forgive me someday
No red lights stopping me
Nothing gonna slow me down
Starting now
I'm gonna find a new way to love you
I'm gonna find the one way to hold you
Cuz I just can't stay
Sitting around
Waitin on love to come back around
Back around
Maybe I should take a bus ride
Maybe I should put this car in drive
And go find the love that we both used to know
Maybe I can find the one way
Maybe you'll forgive me someday
No red lights stopping me
Nothing gonna slow me down
Yea no red lights stopping me
Never gonna slow me down
Starting now
Yea starting now
I'm headin for ya baby
Starting now
I'm gonna find ya baby
Startin now
Ooooo
Ooooo <start> Just give me one more memory that's all I ask of you
To see you once again would mean a lot to me
We'll pretend I'm just a friend that you once knew
So please be there and give me one more memory
Now hello darling I'm just passing through this way
Thought I'd call you up I haven't long to stay
If you'll meet me in our same old meetin' place
I promise you that I won't speak of yesterdays
Just give me one more memory...
Now I respect the choice you made so long ago
And if you're happy dear that's all I need to know
I'm not here to cause you any misery
But if I could see you I'd have one more memory <start> When evening falls its gentle way
When day light closes
Tired eyes and slips away
When fire light bays
In golden hues
I let corner Of the night
I think of you
And I came down and nothing can
Come between us
No mountain high no Rollin Sea
I see the love that could have been us
Then fireside dreaming
Carry's you home to me
And if my hopes can not come true
I'll spend each night of my life
In fireside dreams of you
While breezes tall to every tree
And thru my window
Old man moonlight smiles at me
Across the sky of darkest blue
I loose my sorrow in the flames
And think of you
My foolish heart is sweetly yearning
For how I missed
This world to be
And like a ship that keeps returning
My fireside dreaming carry's you home to me
My fireside dreaming carry's you home to me <start> That's not what i said but if that's what you heard
Then you didn't hear one single word
We're so far apart something is missing
It makes it hard when no one is listening
I say black you say white
I say day you say night
We don't talk anymore without keeping score
I say i need time all you hear is goodbye in your head
If that's what you heard
That's not what i said
Not long ago there was a time
We were so close that you read my mind
Now things that we say end up being hurtful
Lately it seems we go 'round in circles
I say black you say white
I say day you say night
We don't talk anymore without keeping score
I say i need time all you hear is goodbye in your head
If that's what you heard
That's not what i said
Let's lay down our gloves pay attention to love
It doesn't matter who's right
Or who's wrong
If we don't change baby it just keeps going on and on
I say black you say white
I say day you say night
We don't talk anymore without keeping score
I say i need time all you hear is goodbye in your head
If that's what you heard
That's not what i said <start> Let there be not one stranger to away in a manger
Let there be not one soul left untold
Let there be not one face unknown to the face of the one
Who will gather the foe
For Christ's sake it's Christmas
So for Christ sake let everyone know
They all have the choice so lift up your voice
Make sure they know
By Christmas Eve
Pray that everyone sees that we've opened the eyes
That were closed
For Christ's sake it's Christmas
And for Christ's sake let everyone know
For Christ's sake it's Christmas
So for Christ sake let everyone know
They all have the choice so lift up your voice
Make sure they know
By Christmas Eve
Pray that everyone sees that we've opened the eyes
That were closed
For Christ's sake it's Christmas
And for Christ's sake let everyone know <start> I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
And when it's cold outside
Well I've got the month of May
I guess you say
What could make me feel this way
My love my love my love
Talking bout my love my love
I've got so much honey
You know the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Oh than the birds in trees
Oh and I know I know
I know what you're gonna say
What what could make me feel this way
My love my love my love
Talkin' about my love my love <start> When the man from the flowershop rings your doorbell today
Take the red rose with the ribbon of blue
You'll find a million memories you threw away
In this red rose I'm sending to you
It's just a red rose from the blue side of town
From a lonely man you left down
I'm sending it from my world that new world you found
It's just a red rose from the blue side of town
My red rose may not decorate your mansion on the hill
With your pretty flowers all around
But a thousand roses in your garden can't express the love
That's in this red rose I'm sending to you
It's just a red rose from the blue side of town <start> Did I wake you up again
Talking in my sleep
Unfamiliar afternoon
We were out for a little while
Voices from the street
Sunlight in a rented room
I don't know how
You get me lost
Forgotten where I'm running from
I have found
You get me lost
And I don't care where we're going
I'll follow you to your cloud
Or meet you underground
Take me with you either way
What if we'd never met
You lead me to forget
What I was about to say
I'm turned around
You get me lost
Directions wrong way unknown
I have found
You get me lost
And I don't care where we're going <start> Now come and bathe my forehead Mother
For I'm growing very weak
Let one drop of water Mother
Fall upon my burning cheek
Go and tell my little playmates
That I never more will play
Give them all my toys but Mother
Put my little shoes away
You will do this won't you Mother
Please remember what I say
Give them all my toys but Mother
Put my little shoes away
Santa Claus he brought them to me
With a lot of other things
And I thought he brought an angel
With a pair of golden wings
Soon the baby will be larger
And they'll fit his little feet
Won't he look so nice and funny
As he walks upon the street
You will do this won't you Mother
Please remember what I say
Give them all my toys but Mother
Put my little shoes away <start> Somebody's gonna give you a lesson in leavin'
Somebody's gonna give you back what you've been givin'
And I hope that I'm around
To watch 'em knock you down
It's like you to love 'em and leave 'em
Just like you loved me and left me
It's like you to do that sort of thing over and over again
You're a foolhearted man
I hear you've been askin' about me
From some of my friends
Well you'd better believe
I'm not goin' through that again
You're the kind of man
A woman thinks she can change
Oh but the only thing changin' is my way of thinkin'
And I'm thinkin' that maybe someday
Somebody's gonna give you a lesson in losin'
Somebody's gonna do to you what you've been doin'
And I hope that I'm around
To watch 'em knock you down
Somebody's gonna give you a lesson in hurtin'
Somebody's gonna leave you with your fire burnin'
And no way to put it out baby there ain't no doubt
You're a foolhearted man
Yeah you're the kind of man
A woman thinks she can change
But the only thing changin' is my way of thinkin'
And I'm thinkin' that maybe someday
Somebody's gonna give you a lesson in leavin'
Somebody's gonna give you back what you've been givin'
And I hope that I'm around
To watch 'em knock you down
It's like you to love 'em and leave 'em
Just like you loved me and left me
It's like you to do that sort of thing over and over again
You're a foolhearted man
Somebody's gonna give you a lesson in leavin'
Somebody's gonna give you back what you've been givin'
And I hope that I'm around
To watch 'em knock you down
Ohh it's like you to love 'em and leave 'em
Just like you loved me and left me
It's like you to do that sort of thing over and over again
You're a foolhearted man
Oh a foolhearted man
Oh whoa
Oh a foolhearted man
Oh whoa
Oh a foolhearted man <start> Here we go again she's back in town again
I'll take her back again one more time
Here we go again the phone will ring again
I'll be her fool again one more time
I've been there before and I'll try it again
But any fool knows that there's no way to win
Here we go again she'll break my heart again
I'll play the part again one more time
Oh I've been there before...
I'll play the part again one more time <start>  Both 
Forever and ever I'll love you I swear by the stars up above you
There never will be any other I'll love you forever and ever
 Merle 
The sun in the sky may stop shining and the salty old sea may run dry
 Bonnie 
The Man in the Moon may stop smiling but I'll always be by your side
 Both 
Forever and ever I'll love you...
 Bonnie 
No other lips ever will kiss me no other arms ever will hold me
 Merle 
No other heart ever will miss me I'll love you forever and ever
 Both 
Forever and ever I'll love you... <start> They buy you dinner open your door
Other then that what are they good for
Men I'm talking about men
They all want a girl just like the girl that married dear old dad
They make me so mad
Men I'm talking about men
Chorus
Well you can't beat 'em up cause they're bigger then you
You can't live with 'em and you just can't shoot 'em
Men I'm talking about men
They love their toys they make their noise
They're nothing but a bunch of over grown boys
Men I'm talking about men
If you give 'em what they want they never fall in love
Don't give 'em nothing they can't get enough
Men I'm talking about men
Chorus
In the beginning they always aim to please
They serve a purpose they fill a need
They ensure the survival of the species
They take you for a ride run of gas
Most of the time they're a pain in the Yea yea
Men I'm talking about men <start> He said I'll love you till I die
She told him you'll forget in time
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind
He kept her picture on his wall
Went halfcrazy now and then
He still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again
Kept some letters by his bed
Dated nineteen sixtytwo
He had underlined in red
Every single I love you
I went to see him just today
Oh but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today
You know she came to see him one last time
Aww and we all wondered if she would
And it kept runnin' through my mind
This time he's over her for good
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today <start> You ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter
She's a little bit fuller and you're a whole lot shorter
Let's dance all night and fill the jukebox full of quarters
'Cause you ain't Dolly no and you ain't Porter
Well I noticed you right off the bat in those cowboy boots
Who couldn't help but see you in that rhinestone suit
That's cause I'm the reigning queen of karaoke night
Well if I get drunk enough to sing hell I just might
Hey now don't you worry cowboy cause I'll get you through
We'll sing a cheating song just like they used to do
Cause you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter
She's a little bit fuller
Yeah but you're a whole lot shorter
Let's drink all night and fill the jukebox full of quarters
Cause you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter
You'll probably see me country singing on The Voice someday
Yeah and I'm the guy they wrote about in  Shades of Grey
Why don't you come on back to my place and you can have your way
Well baby that sounds tempting but I just can't stay
Oh we won first prize cowboy let's just split the dough
Honey I will always love you but we'll never know
Cause you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter
She's a little bit fuller
Yeah and you're a whole lot shorter
We danced all night and filled the jukebox full of quarters
Cause you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter no
No you ain't Dolly and you ain't Porter <start> What if we were old when we got here
Got a little younger every year
And we all laughed in the face of fear
like it was nothing
What if we could all come in first place
take our time without being late
drink a few beers just to get in shape
yeah wouldn't be something
What if it worked like that
what if this big old world didn't turn so fast
took a little less and gave a little more back
Yeah what if it worked like that
What if we had to many friends
had more money than we could stand
And all the good times wouldn't end
they'd just keep on comin
What if we could hug the ones we missed
Clocking in meant catching fish
And all the pride and prejudice
Had to give into login
What if it worked like that
what if this big old world didn't turn so fast
took a little less and gave a little more back
Yeah what if it worked like that
What if it worked like that
what if this big old world didn't turn so fast
It took a little less and gave more back
Yeah what if it worked like that <start> I play an old guitar from nine 'till half past one
I'm just trying to make a living watching everyone else have fun
I don't miss much if it happens on the dance hall floor
I said mercy look what just walked through that door
Hello TROUBLE
What in the world are you doing ALONE
Hey good LOOKING
I smell TROUBLE
I was a little bitty baby when my papa hit the skids
Mamma had a time trying to raise nine kids
She taught me not to stare cause it was impolite
She did the best she could trying to raise me right
But mama never taught me bout nothing like YOU
I Bet your mama must have been a good lookin' honey too
Hey good LOOKING
I smell TROUBLE
You sweet talking sexy walkin honky tonkin' baby
The men are gonna' love you the women are gonna' hate you
Reminding them of everything they're never gonna' be
It maybe the beginning of the world war three
'Cause the world ain't ready for nothing like YOU
Bet your mama must have been a good looking honey too
Hey good LOOKING
I smell TROUBLE <start> Instrumental <start> Iam missing mississippi miss that misty delta dawn. Iam missing mississippi how i miss my mississippi home.

But time hasent touched my daddys love or his hard working share croping life couse i over heard his soft tender words when he talked to her picture last night. <start> I see a candlelight down in the little green valley
Where Morning Glory vines are twining around my door
Oh how I wish I was there again down in the little green valley
For then my homesick heart will trouble me no more
There's only one thing ever brings me consolation
And that's the dream that I'll be going back someday
And every night down upon my knees
I pray the Lord to please take me
Back to that little old green valley far away
I see a candlelight down in the little green valley
Where Morning Glory vines are twining around my door
Oh how I wish I was there again down in the little green valley
For then my homesick heart will trouble me no more
There's only one thing ever brings me consolation
And that's the dream that I'll be going back someday
And every night down upon my knees
I pray the Lord to please take me
Back to that little old green valley far away <start> Mamas don't let your cowboys grow up to be babies
Mamas don't let your cowboys grow up to be babies
Let'em drink that Lone Star all night long
You got to raise them on chickenfried steak gotta feed them real gravy
He's gonna make you proud that he's your son
Yeah mamas don't let your cowboys grow up to be babies
Let'em drink that tequila and get stoned
You got to raise them on chickenfried steak gotta feed them real gravy
He's gonna make you proud that he's your son
He may want to ride across the border
It don't do not harm to sow some oats
He might even find himself a wild one
Some seeds you got to sow on your own
There ain't nothing wrong with a little wild streak
It's ok to go howling at the moon
He might even find himself a wild thing
Wild things need love too yes they do
Mamas don't let your cowboys grow up to be babies
Let'em drink that Lone Star all night long
You got to raise them on chickenfried steak gotta feed them real gravy
He's gonna make you proud that he's your son
He's gonna make you proud that he's your son <start> Follow me back like a ride on a train
Make it hard to remember the cold
Take care of your money and stay out of the rain
Your bones could give out when you're old
I get more of a feeling from words that have truth
A feeling like something is wrong
Let the door slide open let the sunlight in
Call my name girl Sorrow
All of the times that I heard you sing
I hoped there parts there for me
I'd sing all the notes that stay out of your way
We can let all those melodies free
I think I was meant for an uglier time
My harmony's all out of tune
Let the verse slide over let the chorus in
Call my name girl Sorrow <start> Maundering I'm maundering
Evil eyes just passing trough
Maundering oh maundering
Do you know what I'm wanting to do
I'm going to find something true
Well I never to be what you wanted to see
And I wish that she would be patient with me
Maundering I'm maundering
Evil is as evil do
Maundering just maundering
God is always showing this to you
I'm going to glorify everything good
And put right what is wrong as I should <start> Faded old blue wranglers dusty cowboy hat pair of scuffed up boots upon your feet
Can of pork n beans that you opened with your knife
It ain't much but its all you've got to eat
You think of what your daddy said if your money should run low
Just call I'll send your busfare to come home
But you're just to proud to take it and home won't be the same
Now you've had a taste of rodeo
You set out on the road to seek your boyhood dreams
To satisfy the hunger in your soul
You wouldn't turn back now even if you could you were born to follow rodeo
All your money's gone cept a twenty dollar bill
But that's your fees to enter old Cheyenne
And all that's in your favor is you and your try
And a deep knawing desperately to win
Ss you step out on the highway with your thumb up in the air
In your mind a promise has been made
If this way of life don't kill you or you don't starve to death
You swear you'll be the champion someday
You set out on the road...
Faded old blue wranglers dusty cowboy hat pair of scuffed up boots upon your feet
Can of pork n beans that you open with your knife
It ain't much but its all you've got to eat
You set out on the road... <start> Today my heart is burden I'm back to settle down
I saw the bright lights of the city I'd have all the joys of town
But there was something missing while I was roamin' round
Now I know just what was missing the little girl in my hometown
I'm back but I am too late cause she just married a friend
She waited for me lonely years for all my roaming to end
She were tired of just waiting for a love that let her down
I lost my only real true love the little girl in my hometown
 steel 
It's my heart that I've broken as no one has to blame
I could try now to win her but that might cause her shame
So I'll travel down this lonesome road till journey's end I'll find
I'll always love I can't forget the little girl in my hometown
I didn't mean to forget her when I went away
Ramble's all I cared to do didn't know I'd have to pay
I didn't mean to be untrue to her didn't mean to let her down
I lost my only real true love the little girl in my hometown <start> come and go as I please.
From down here up North and inbetween
But baby it's a shame 'cause I always feel the same
When I can't see Texas from here.
Chorus
I can't see Texas from here.
No matter how I try it makes me want to cry.
So if you see me lookin' down
I'm tryin' not to show this frown
'Cause I can't see Texas from here.
I can't say I don't like Tennessee.
The people here have all been good to me.
So please don't take offense if I start to get intense
Just 'cause I can't see Texas from here.
Chorus x <start> Blues outside my door
I don't even know if it's raining
But I've been here before
And I don't wanna be here again
Ev'ry now and then
voices on the wind
call me back to the first time
far away and clear
you can hear the tear drops
falling for the last in love.
If I let you down
All I can say is I'm sorry
Now it's' all over town
So I don't want to hear it from you
Please don't look away it's hard enough to say
This could go on forever
When the night is clear
I can hear the teardrops
Falling for the last in love. <start> Girl if you only knew
How many times
I've reached for you
Every night
I'd drift off to sleep
And there you would be
Reaching for me too
Oh but now
I don't have to close my eyes
For this dream to come alive
It's real
It's here in my heart
Stronger than steel
Brighter than a million stars
Baby you have shown me
How love should feel
Every single touch
Tells me that this love is real
I guess I really thought
The thrill would wear off
Eventually
Oh but still
I can't get enough
I still get a rush
When you're close to me
You're the fire
Burning in my soul
And that is how I know
It's real
It's here in my heart
Stronger than steel
Brighter than a million stars
Baby you have shown me
How love should feel
Every single touch
Tells me that this love is real
I can't remember
Ever feeling like this
With every look and every kiss
It's real
Baby you have shown me
How love should feel
Every single touch
Tells me that this love
Every single touch
Tell me that this love is real <start> Your phone call took me by surprise
Gee its been a long long time
Since those hot and humid Texas nights
We went swimmin' in the tide
Corpus Cristi seems so far away
And I'm not talkin' 'bout the miles
There ain't much I wouldn't give today
Just to see one of your smiles
But I'm stuck here in Denver
Sippin' California wine
And I've got all night to remember you
I'm in a lone star state of mind
I just saw John Wayne on the late late show
He saved the girl and rode away
But I was hopin' as the credits rolled
He'd make it back to her some day
An' its a thousand miles or more
From here to your front door
Oh I'd be there tomorrow if I had my way
Well I'd jus' pack up my guitar
You know its really not that far
And when you called you said I'd have a place to stay <start> Think of me when you're lonely
Think of me when you're blue
Think of me when you're far away
And I'll be thinking of you
Remember all of the good times
We had in days gone by
Remember all of the sadness
The day you said goodbye
You told me you would be leavin'
But you wouldn't be gone too long
Now I hope and pray with each new day
That you'll come atravelin' home
Think of me when you're lonely
Think of me when you're blue
Think of me when you're far away
And I'll be thinking of you
I watch the mailman comin'
I wait by the telephone
I meet the trains down at the station
And I spend my nights alone
But now the waitin' is over
And Time has set the scene
'Cos God meant me for only you
And he meant you for me <start> Would you be my Tennessee valentine
Hold me close and call me dear
On more time
We'll waltz in the moonlight
and kiss beneath the pines
Would you be my Tennessee valentine
Heart to heart
Hand in hand
I love your sweet harmony
We slipped out of tune
Way too soon
I'm still trying to find the key
So would you be my Tennessee valentine
Hold me close and call me dear
On more time
We'll waltz in the moonlight
and kiss beneath the pines
Would you be my Tennessee valentine
I loved you then
I love you now
I pray that you will be mine
You hold the key
To my melody
A song that is just for you and me <start> This is a lovely way to spend an evening
Can't think of anything I'd rather do
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
Can't think of anyone as lovely as you
We'll just belong together and dance round and round the room
Playing our favorite records humming our favorite tune
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you
 guitar 
We'll just belong together... <start> Well they say he knows whose been naughty or nice
And if I have my way baby after tonight
We'll be one couple he can scratch off his list
Let's be naughty and save Santa the trip
Such a long sleigh ride from the North Pole
And he's already got so many places to go
We've got each other don't need another gift
Let's be naughty and save Santa the trip
Well Santa's face would turn red if he could only see
What we'll be unwrapping underneath our Christmas tree
Well this year all I'm asking for is one little wish
Let's be naughty and save Santa the trip
When St. Nick comes home early tonight
Mrs. Clause will surely be surprised
They'll get to snuggle cuddle up just like this
Let's be naughty and save Santa the trip
Naked naughty and save Santa the trip
Nasty naughty and save Santa the trip
Bad bad bad bad bad naughty and save Santa the trip
Bad bad bad naughty and Santa the trip
Gonna save him the whole trip
Get some of those elves over here
And save Santa the trip <start> I'm gonna lay down my burdens down by the riverside
Down by the riverside down by the riverside
Oh I'm gonna lay down my burdens down by the riverside
Ain't gonna study war no more
Well I ain't gonna study war no more ain't gonna study war no more
Ain't gonna study war no more
I ain't gonna study war...
I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield down by the riverside
Down by the riverside down by the riverside
I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield down by the riverside
Ain't gonna study war no more
Well I ain't gonna study war...
I ain't gonna study war...
I'm gonna put on my robe and crown down by the riverside
Down by the riverside down by the riverside
I'm gonna put on my robe and crown down by the riverside
Ain't gonna study war no more
Well I ain't gonna study war...
I ain't gonna study war... <start> All the good times are past and gone all the good times are past and gone
All the good times are past and gone what's left for a poor boy to do
I can still see my mama bend over that ol' washpot
And it's so doggone cold you could nearly freeze on the spot
My pa eatin' them flapjacks and yellin' for more
And the kids makin' tracks across mama's clean floor
But all them good times are past and gone now all the good times are gone
Well you could look for miles down a winding railroad track
And see train a leavin' and hear one comin' back
And with a cloud of blue up over your head
It's like something from a storybook that you once read
But all them good times are past and gone now all the good times are gone
All the good times are past and gone what's left for a poor boy to do
And go down on that river when the big boats make their run
And the cane poles grow so thick they block up the sun
Just smell that coffee boilin' in an old tin can
And that hot grease poppin' in the fryin' pan
But all them good times are past and gone now all them good times are gone
All the good times are past and gone what's left for a poor boy to do <start> Down in the valley the valley so low
Hang your head over hear the wind blow
Hear the blow hear the wind blow
Hang your head over hear the wind blow
Roses love sunshine violets love dew
Angels in heaven know I love you
If you don't love me love who you please
Put your arms 'round me give my heart ease
Give my heart ease love give my heart ease
Put your arms 'round me give my heart ease
Write me a letter send it by mail
Send it in care of the Birmingham jail
Birmingham jail love Birmingham jail
Send it in care of the Birmingham jail
Build me a castle forty feet high
So I can see her as she rides by
As she rides by love as she rides by
So I can see her as she rides by
Down in the valley the valley so low
Hang your head over hear the wind blow <start> Maybe someday I'll be strong
Maybe it won't be long
I'll be the one who's tough
You'll be the one who's got it rough
It won't be long and
Maybe I'll be real strong
Maybe I'll do things right
Maybe I'll start tonight
You'll learn to cry like me
Baby let's just wait and see
Maybe I'll start tonight
And do things right
You'll control me
And oh so boldly
Rule me 'til I'm free
'Til the pain that shakes me
Finally makes me
Get up off of my knees
Maybe I'll be as fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts too
But I think that you'll slow down
When your turn to hurt comes around
Maybe I'll break hearts
And be as fast as you
You'll control me
Oh so boldly
Rule me 'til I'm free
'Til the pain that shakes me
Finally makes me
Get up off of my knees
Maybe I'll be as fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts too
But I think that you'll slow down
When your turn to hurt comes around
Maybe I'll break hearts and be as fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts and be as fast as you
Oh sucker

I'll be the one who's tough
You'll be the one who's got it rough

Maybe I'll break hearts too <start> Well you think I'll be lonely you think I'll be blue

From now until eternity I swear by stars above
Well you think I'll always be the way I've always been
You think that if you'll ask me to I'll come back again yes I will you know I will <start> Some say love it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love it is a razer
That leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love it is a flower
And you it's only seed
It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live
When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
That you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose <start> Don't you think it's time to forget leave your troubles behind
Take that road up ahead
Don't you think it's time to let go time to let it out
Time to let it show
Let's have a good time we don't need a reason

And it ain't that hard to find it's just a state of mind

Get up get up get up now <start> I had a dream last night
I was floating down that black water
Kick back on the Mississippi
On a raft with ol' Tom Sawyer
He got restless down around Memphis
That's where he left me
Said I'm one rambling man
I was gone before you met me
And there I was back in my hometown
That's just how dreams go
Thumb in the air wanted out of there
Heading my own road
Well I hitched a ride with this beatnik guy
Said looks like you read me
My name is Jack Kerouac
I was gone before you met me
You got your homeboys your hangaroundboys
You fix that roof but your roots to the groundboys
Pink house the white fence
Pretty little woman two point five
Kids dang right it's a good life
With boys like me your bound to run the wild side
Like the restless wind you'll never catch me
I was gone before you met me
And just before I awoke
I had a bad nightmare
I was on some lost highway and you were nowhere near
Someone took your hand I wasn't that man
Girl it sure did hit me
I was cussing fate but it was too late
You were gone before you met me
Yeah I smelled that coffee
I heard you singing in the kitchen
Walking in got a kiss you said the sink still dripping
Thank God I'm still driven
You got your homeboys your hangaroundboys
You fix that sink but your roots to the groundboys
Blue house the white fence
Sweet little woman rocking that good
Miss dang right it's a fine life
His restless heart found a heart I can call mine
I was smart enough to let love catch me
So Tom and Jack just ramled on without me
'Cause I was gone before you met me
Gone gone gone before you met me
Gone before you met me <start> I saw a little beam of sunlight
Steal across a purple sky
And bent down to kiss a rose bud
Oh it made me wanna cry
And to think that I've been permitted
To see a part of nature's plan
Oh there's nothing that stands out more
Than the selfishness in man
Little children painting pictures
Of the blooms and apple trees
Oh why can't the grown up people
Have faith of one thing
And to think those tiny fingers
Might become a killer's hand
Oh there's nothing that stands out more
Than the selfishness in man
Why can't we see the folly
And the uselessness of pain
Love could lead to understanding
Maybe it's not too late
Then perhaps through His great wisdom
We might learn to understand
Then there'd be no shame or sorrow
And no selfishness in man
Then perhaps through His great wisdom
We might learn to understand
Then there'd be no shame or sorrow
And no selfishness in man <start> Will the roses bloom where she lies sleeping
Will the flowers shed their pedals there
Will the dewdrops fall upon the roses
Where my darling sleeps beneath the sand
Her lips were like a bunch of roses
Her eyes were like the starlit sky
Her hair was dark and it was curly
I'll miss her till the day I die
I miss my darling she is sleeping
Underneath the beautiful sky
I miss her now since she has left me
I will miss her til the day I die <start> I'm lost in the night
The icy wind is howlin' out your name
And desolation linger like the fog
The fire is growing dimmer
In the wind
I'm out in the rain
The moon has gone behind
The cloud again
And I can't stand to live another day
'Cause my bluebird went away
And I am locked in this room with my sorrow
No escape no way to get away
And my only connection
With tomorrow
Is hoping that you might decide
Not to stay away
Oh I'm out on a limb
If I could only find sweet love again
To live my life this way
Is too much to bear
Can't find my bluebird anywhere <start> Only fools would race down Grist Mill Road
Let alone in angry weather
That what I tell everyone I know
Now that I know better
That's a lesson I wish I woulda learned
Without havin' to watch my Mustang burn
Before my best buddy had to wind up hurt
An' his whole life changed
That's a lesson I wish I didn't learn the hard way
Only a fool would keep a diamond ring
In a box on the top of his closet
He came so close he almost asked
It was right there in his pocket
That's a lesson I wish I woulda learned
Before standin' in the back row of that church
Watchin' her daddy givin' her
To the man who took my place
That's a lesson I wish I didn't learn the hard way
Regret's been know to give a man a beatin'
But I ain't in the mood for fightin' back this evenin'
Only fools don't take the time of day
They stay too busy runnin'
An' to stop just once to tell their Dad
Just how much they love him
That's a lesson I wish I woulda learned
Before that phone call came an' it was her
No Momma never had to say a word
I knew it was too late
That's a lesson I wish I didn't learn the hard way <start> They married on a fancy yacht out on the water
He knew she was young enough to be his daughter
There're always questions in the heart of millionaires
Would she make heartfelt promises if the money was not there
And he said Do you love me baby Do you want me to hold
Or are you just digging for gold
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul
Or are you just digging for gold
She ran his weary heart through the ringer
And she wore him like the diamond ring around her finger
Well his advances and affections she managed to avoid
But she got the lap of luxury and he got paranoid
And he said Do you love me baby Do you want me to hold
Or are you just digging for gold
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul
Or are you just digging for gold digging for gold
Big house limousines
Fine wines fine cuisines
Vale and Vegas twice a year
Trips to Paris on the Leer
Black Tuesday when that wall of wealth came crashing down
Bad news day when that little queen had to give back her crown
And he said Hey babe we can live on love 'cause love is worth much more.
But he barely got his feelings out she was half way to the door
And she never even heard him cry
Do you love me baby Do you want me to hold
Or are you just digging for gold
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul
Or are you just digging for gold <start> Some gotta wear their heart on their sleeve
Me I gotta keep it on hand or I can't sleep
I keep it under my thumb
In the palm of my hand
Chorus
I gotta love like a glove
Gotta grip on me
Gotta push and a shove like machinery
When it gets too big it'll shrink to fit
Gotta love like a glove
And I'm wearing it
Some wanna show the world what they got
I keep it under wraps tie a lovers knot
From around my wrist
To my fingertips
Chorus
Some gotta wear their heart on their sleeve
Me I gotta have it on hand or I can't sleep
You gotta fight to keep it
Loose and legal
Love don't leave it
Keep it hand to hand
Chorus <start> The lights in the harbor
Don't shine for me.
I'm like a lost ship
Adrift on the sea.
Sea of heartbreak lost love an' loneliness
Memories of your caress so divine.
I wish you were mine again my dear.
I am on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak.
How did I lose you
Oh where did I fail
Why did you leave me
Always to sail
This sea of heartbreak lost love an' loneliness
Memories of your caress so divine.
How I wish you were mine again my dear.
I am on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak.
Oh what I'd give to sail back to shore
Back to your arms once more.
Oh come to my rescue
Come here to me .
Take me and keep me
Away from the sea.
Yes this sea of heartbreak lost love an' loneliness
Memories of your caress so divine.
How I wish you were mine again my dear.
I'm on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak.
It's a sea of heartbreak. <start> If you're trying to reach Heaven
you talk to Jesus you talk to Him every day.
'Cause Jesus knows He knows that you are coming
and Heaven's just a prayer away.
If you go if you go to church on Sunday
you get down on your knees and pray
and give your heart and your soul to Jesus.
Heaven's just a prayer away.
You are just one prayer from Heaven
as you travel down life's highway.
Just when you think that you can't make it
well Heaven's just a prayer away.
Of if you go if you go to church on Sunday
you get down on your knees and pray
and give your heart and give your soul to Jesus.
Heaven's just a prayer away.
Heaven's just a prayer away.
Away. <start> Am I to face these lonely halls alone
And when you leave who's gonna walk me home
Cause when you walk out the door I won't see you no more
And you're the one I adore so baby
Chorus
Don't drop out of my life baby don't be a fool

You're old enough to know you're too young to face the world so cruel

You're not prepared to do anything
So if you wanna buy me that diamond ring well
Don't drop out of my life baby don't drop out
My parents say you're lazy but you can be smart if you try
And I know you've got a heart cause you've never ever made me cry
They say you're no good so baby do what you should
And stay here by my side oh darlin'
Repeat Chorus

Don't drop out of my life
Baby don't drop out
 <start> Before the sun came up
He sipped that coffee black
Slid on his muddy boots
Pulled down his feed store cap
He taught me how to grease the points
On that massey 
But I was way too busy
Didn't really care to go
So he worked the fields alone
But what I didn't know
Up on that tractor
Things might be faster in the world
But big wheels rollin' slow
Help you see what's important
What really does matter
Up on that tractor
Just like the dirt is black
So do the years fly by
He stayed home with mom
I travelled far and wide
And like a good man does
He listened when I called
Told him 'bout my crazy life
And all the things I saw
But when it was time to go
He wanted me to know
Up on that tractor
Things might be faster in the world
But big wheels rollin' slow
Help you see what's important
What really does matter
Up on that tractor
It tore my world apart
When god took him away
Didn't get to say goodbye
And I miss him everyday
When all the fields grew up
This is right back where I came <start> Heading for the station with a pack on my back
Tired of transportation in the back of a hack
I love to hear the rhythm of the clickety clack
And hear the lonesome whistle see the smoke from the stack
Pal around with Democratic fellows named Mack
So take me right back to the track Jack
Chorus
Choo choo choo choo ch' boogie
Woo woo woo woo ch' boogie
Choo choo choo choo ch' boogie
Take me right back to the track Jack
You reach your destination but alas  alack
You need some compensation to get back in the black
You take the morning paper from the top of the stack
And read the situation from the front to the back
The only job that's open needs a man with a knack
So put it right back in the rack jack
Chorus <start> My friends all say that
I'm losing touch with reality
'Cause you're just too much
My life's been going down
Even quit my job
They all say give him up
Makes a life too hard
But I say
Chorus
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Of your love love love
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Of your love love love
I keep praying it will never end
I just wanna be your lover
Log on to Topdb.
I don't care about my friends
You keep coming on
With that sweet caress
All those subtle looks
And that scorching kiss
And I say
Chorus
I'm getting weaker
As the day goes by
But your mind won't
Let my body quit
Just keep thinking
'Bout your flashy smile
And everything that comes with it
One of these days
Maybe they'll understand
That I'm happiest
Melting in your hands
I can't resist you
I can't control you
I could never leave you
Just wanna hold you
Chorus x
My friends all say
You got to give her up
But I say
Chorus
I'm getting weaker
As the day goes by
But I say <start> Theres a place in Ireland I Know well
Were I spend so many happy times
Were I d sit for hours by the lake side
With my dads old fishing rod and line
And the warm summer evenings by the river
With my true loves hand clasped in mine
Were we made our promises together
That Id be his and hed be mine
Oh take me back to those good old days
Those times not very long ago
Let me relive again those sweet memories
Of my life in my Irish Country home
Now Im far far away from my home lane
Im living many miles across the sea
For I had to go abroad to get employment
Cause at home there was no work for me
But I know I always will remember
Those golden memories of home
And all though Im living ore the water
My heart is in my Irish Country Home
Oh take me back to those good old days
Those times not very long ago
Let me relive again those sweet memories
Of my life in my Irish Country home
Repeat
Yes my Life in my Iris Country home <start> Uh...I met Shania Twain and I met ol Tim McGraw
Billy Ray Cyrus and little David Ball
A little bit of luck and my life will be complete
There's a little bitty blonde that I'd really want to meet
I sure like Mindy McCready
Start pumpin iron and aeatin my Wheaties
Got to get in shape
If I want to get a date
But first I gotta lose a little bit of weight
My little bitty sweetie in her little nighty gown
A litty bitty kiss and I'd probably come unwound
I love to watch her dance and I like to watch her sing
Want a little better look at her belly button ring
I sure like Mindy McCready
Take a little ride down to Panama City
Just the two of us on her little bitty bus
With a whole lot of love and whole lot of lust
I work a little job for a crummy little check
Heck I'd trade it all for a hug around the neck
Paid a lot of hope for my little bitty scheme
Cause I could never fit in her litte bitty jeans
I'm a good old boy she's a pretty little girl
Wish I had a chance to rock her little bitty world
I'm a little bit insane cause I love her somethin fierce
Gonna go and get my big old belly button pierced
I'd sure like to meet Mindy McCready
Give me half a chance and buddy yes indeedwhy
Guys do it all the time I'd better get in line
Better go and buy her some of Deana Carter's wine
I sure love Mindy McCready
Start pumpin iron and aeatin my Wheaties
Got to get in shape
If I want to get a date
Be <start> Please listen to me bartender I've got something on my mind
I think I'd might feel better after one more glass of wine
I'm payin' for a broken heart the price of love is high
With nothing left to live for what's there to do but die

I know you're right bartender goodnight I'm going home <start> 
There's a pretty little girl in my hometown
I tried to kiss her but she turned me down
Tried to hug her but her answer was the same
She's got blue eyes and the beauty spot
I called her Tuscalosa touched me not
Her name is Mary Claire Melvina Rebecca Jane
What's her name what's her name
Her name is Mary Claire Melvina Rebecca Jane

 banjo 
She's the cutiest little girl I ever saw in my life
I hope someday she'll be my wife
I'm gonna ask her to let me change her name
She got blue eyes and the beauty spot...
 banjo 
What's her name what's her name... <start> In the empire of the senses
You're the queen of all you survey
All the cities all the nations
Everything that falls your way
There is a deeper wave than this
That you don't understand
There is a deeper wave than this
Tugging at your hand
Every ripple on the ocean
Every leaf on every tree
Every sand dune in the desert
Every power we never see
There is a deeper wave than this
Swelling in the world
There is a deeper wave than this
Listen to me girl
Feel it rising in the cities
Feel it sweeping over land
Over borders over frontiers
Nothing will its power withstand
There is no deeper wave than this
Rising in the world
There is no deeper wave than this
Listen to me girl
All the bloodshed all the anger
All the weapons all the greed
All the armies all the missiles
All the symbols of our fear
There is a deeper wave than this
Rising in the world
There is a deeper wave than this
Listen to me girl
At the still point of destruction
At the center of the fury
All the angels all the devils
All around us can't you see
There is a deeper wave than this
Rising in the land
There is a deeper wave than this
Nothing will withstand
I say love is the seventh wave <start> Aren't we the same two people
Who took those vows that mean nothing now
Didn't we sit at this table as husband and wife
Now we're on opposite sides
Is this the way love ends
With paper and pen
Chorus
It's all there in black and white
All the words that separate our lives
It's all there wrong or right
But love falls between the lines
It's something you can't write
In black and white
Can we forget all the good times
And never look back it is as easy as that
Can we be sure that it's finished
With tears in our eyes can we say that we tried
It's all come down to this
Is there something that we missed
Chorus
I've told my friends you've told yours
But opening and closing doors swing both ways
Is it too late
Chorus <start> By a lonely prison wall
I heard a young girl calling
Micheal they are taking you away
For you stole Trevelyn's corn
So the young might see the morn.
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay.
Low lie the Fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly.
Our love was on the wing we had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry.
By a lonely prison wall
I heard a young man calling
Nothing matter Mary when your free
Against the Famine and the Crown
I rebelled they ran me down
Now you must raise our child with dignity.
Low lie the Fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly.
Our love was on the wing we had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry.
By a lonely harbor wall
She watched the last star falling
As that prison ship sailed out against the sky
Sure she'll wait and hope and pray
For her love in Botany Bay
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry.
Low lie the Fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly.
Our love was on the wing we had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry. <start> I'm tempted my darling to steal you away
Don't let me crossover stay out of my way.
You know that I love you and I'm not the stealing kind
But I'm faced with heartaches at love's cheating line.
Chorus
Don't let me crossover loves cheating line
You belong to another and could never be mine.
I know one step closer would be heaven divine
Don't let me crossover loves cheating line.
I tried to forget you but what else can I do
When your eyes keep saying that you love me too.
I know if I lose you not a dream will I have left
I don't want to cheat dear but I can't help myself.
Chorus <start> He was born and raised around Jacksonville
A nice young man not the kind to kill
But the jealous fight and a flashing blade
Sent him on the run through the Everglades
Runnin' like the dog through the Everglades
Now the posse went in and they came back out
And said he'll die and there ain't no doubt
It's an eye for an eye the debt is paid
You won't last long in the Everglades
A man can't live in the everglades
Where a man can hide and never be found
And have no fear of the baying hounds
But he better keep movin' and don't stand still
If the skeeters don't get him in Gatersville
If the skeeters don't get him in the Gatersville
 ac.guitar 
Now the years went by and his girl was wed
His family gave him up for dead
Now and then the natives would say
They'd seen him a runnin' through the Everglades
Runnin' like the dog through the Everglades
Now he never heard the news on the radio
He was deep in the glades and he'll never know
He's runnin' and a hidin' and didn't make much sense
The jury had ruled it was selfdefence
The jury had ruled it was selfdefence
Where a man can hide... <start> When I came to this morning she was packing up her things
Even with my pounding head I could hear her call me names
you don't work and drink and fish and dance and partyloving fool
Rolled off her tongue and all I could say was baby think it through
And give me one good reason why you want to leave me
You know I love you baby just calm down and take it easy
Lay down here beside me
No need for quick decisions
Before you throw all this away
Give me one good reason
She said you ain't brought a flower into this house in years
Your gift to me last valentine's was a case of your favorite beer.
Did I forget to mention I can't stand the sight of you
I said don't sugarcoat it baby you know I can take the truth
Give me one good reason why you want to leave me
You know I love you baby just calm down and take it easy
Lay down here beside me
No need for quick decisions
Before you throw all this away
Give me one good reason <start> Too bad what's happened to our good love
Too bad what's happened to our good love
Sometimes our best isn't quite good enough
And the last word in lonesome is me
Life is a desert and love quenches thirst
Life is a desert and love quenches thirst
We have to hurt sometime this is my first time
The last word in lonesome is me
The last word in lonesome is me
The last word in lonesome is me
My heart is as lonely as a heart can be lonely
And the last word in lonesome is me <start> Waking to the silence of this quality
The one the angels decided to hand down
For the beauty of the deeds that are forgiven
I surrender and I lay me down
For Michael and Gabriel who hold me
And the wings that make the silence of that sound
And for the tender touch that comes when I stop to listen
I surrender I lay me down
For the letting go of all I hold so tightly
Releasing clouds and silver linings of my mind
Finding ways to see all of my horizons
For mothers and fathers who may guide
For the courage to breathe the words of fire and love
And looking out with freedom to abandon
And for the tender touch that comes when I stop to listen
I surrender I lay me down
Breathing with the silence of this quality
The grace the angels decided to hand down
For the beauty of the deeds that are forgiven
I surrender and I lay me down
I surrender I lay me down
I surrender I lay me down <start> There she was just seventeen
Cryin' on the mornin' after
He told her everything she wanted to hear
All those drunken reasons that she had
For givin' in don't matter
And they don't stop the tears noooo
What do you do when it's too late
What do you say when you can't change the truth
Of what you've done
And it's coming at you fast
When you can't hide the hurt inside
How do you pray to make it right
When you wanna change the past
And you can't take it back
You can't take it back
Scared to death she tells her friend
To meet her at the drugstore counter
And finds out what she didn't wanna hear
Daddy will die
Her mamma will cry
The kids at school will talk about her
There ain't no easy way outta here oh
What do you do when it's too late
What do you say when you can't change the truth
Of what you've done
And it's coming at you fast
When you can't hide the hurt inside
How do you pray to make it right
When you wanna change the past
And you can't take it back
You can't take it back
All the choices
That she's made
That baby staring back at her
Is one she wouldn't change
What do you do when it's too late
What do you say when you can't change the truth
Of what you've done
And it's coming at you fast
When you can't hide the hurt inside
How do you pray to make it right
When you wanna change the past
And you can't take it back
You can't take it back
What do you do when it's too late
What do you say when you can't change the truth
Of what you've done
And it's coming at you fast
When you can't hide the hurt inside
How do you pray to make it right
When you wanna change the past
And you can't take it back
You can't take it back
Sometimes it ain't so bad <start> Would you lay with me in a field of stone
If my needs were strong would you lay with me
Should my lips grow dry would you wet them dear
In the midnight hour if my lips were dry
Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
Wipe the blood away from my dying hand if I give myself to you
Would you bathe with me in the stream of life
When the moon is full will you bathe with me
Will you still love me when I'm down and out
In my time of trials will you stand by me
Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
Wipe the blood away from my dying hand if I give myself to you
Would you lay with me in a field of stone
If my needs were strong would you lay with me <start> wake up wake up little maggie
why do you sleep so sound
them highway robbers are a coming
gone a tear your play house down
oh where is my little darling
the girl I love so dear
she's gone away and left me
andis a courtin some other one
I got drunk in the city
then I stumbled and fell at her door
she throwed her little arms around me
but she bid me come back no more
Oh my head bows down like the willow
and I'm lonesome like a dove
sometimes there's tears on my pillow
when I think about my love <start> Only This Moment Is Mine
There're so many things we'll change
If we lived our lives again
So many things we would and we would not do
All the past mistakes we've made
And the price that we have paid
Oh how we liveth we could start anew
But there is no going back
And we can't change the past
Or turned back the hands of time
Yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery
And I know that only this moment is mine
There are things we never tried
And tears we never cried
If we have know the hell was far too steep
We'd have never tumbled down
Or fallen in and drowned
If we've known the river was so deep
But there is no going back
And we can't change the past
Or turned back the hands of time
Yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery
And I know that only this moment is mine
 Instrumental Interlude 
So it's the best that we forget
The things we now regret
For we cannot go back and change the past
Never use those old mistakes
A better life to make
And tomorrow we may find that we win at last
But there is no going back
And we can't change the past
Or turned back the hands of time
Yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery
And I know that only this moment is mine
Yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery
And I know that only this moment is mine <start> 
She's my curly headed baby
She's from sunny Tennessee
She's my curly headed baby
She's more than all the world to me
I have loved her since I met her 
More than any tongue can tell
If she ever prove falls hearted
It would be so hard to say farewell
Yodeleyieieieie

Now let me tell you 'bout some women 
I can tell you how they'll do
They gonna be cryin' on your shoulder
And be flirting with another too
She's my curly headed baby
She's from sunny Tennessee
She's my curly headed baby
She's more than all the world to me
Yodeleyieieieie

When I look into her blue eyes
There's more than words can ever say
I could never love some other
No one else can make me feel this way
She's my curly headed baby
She's from sunny Tennessee
She's my curly headed baby
She's more than all the world to me
Yodeleyieieieie <start> It's a clear night
How are you tonight
Its a bone white
Smile of a night
There are chimes
That chill my bones
I know you don't know
Which way I will go
When I cross that line
Fosberry flop across that line
I once was one of you <start> Have I given anything today
Have I helped some needed soul on the way
From the dawn 'till setting sun have I wounded anyone
Shall I weep for what I've done today
Oh today oh the day oh the day
Have I failed some greater flame on the way
Just to know I've done my best as I go to take my rest
Let my name be blessed today

Did I cancel with the sad try to make some poor heart glad
Answer wisdom what I had today
Oh today oh the day <start> Longneck bottle
Let go of my hand
Hey jukebox don't start playin' that song again
'Cause there's a girl at home who loves me
You know she won't understand
Longneck bottle
Let go of my hand
Hey barroom mirror on the wall
Go stare at someone else
Don't show the world the fool I am
Just keep it to yourself
Longneck bottle
Let go of my hand
Hey jukebox don't start playin' that song again
'Cause there's a girl at home who loves me
You know she won't understand
Longneck bottle
Let go of my hand
Dance floor seems you're underneath my feet
Everywhere I turn
I oughta waltz right out of them swingin' doors
But that's a step I just can't learn <start> The one I love is knocking at my door
With the kind of look I never saw before.
He said Hey baby you and me.
Nothin' like knowin' when it's time to leave.
Took a listen to his advice
Thought about it once but I didn't think twice.
I packed my life in a paper sack
Don't miss nothing that I never had.
This old car's our limousine
Ridin' on hope livin' on dreams.
Don't wanna know nothin' about readin' the map.
We're makin' it up as we go.
Final destination Dont look back
'Cos when you're shootin' the dice you just tumble and roll.
If we ever get lost we can use the stars.
Right now we don't care where we are.
Spin them wheels gonna get there yet.
Runnin' down the road of no regrets.
We got each other and that's enough.
Ain't we lucky we got love
Don't wanna know nothin' about readin' the map.
We're makin' it up as we go.
Final destination Dont look back'
'Cos when you're shootin' the dice you just tumble and roll.
Got each other and that's enough.
Ain't we lucky we got love
Don't wanna know nothin' about readin' the map.
We're makin' it up as we go.
Final destination Dont look back
'Cos when you're shootin' the dice.
Don't wanna know nothin' about readin' the map.
We're makin' it up as we go.
Final destination Dont look back
'Cos when you're shootin' the dice you just tumble and roll. <start> A million dollar face
So ivory and fair
That launched a thousand ships
Danced with Fred Astaire
Lusted for her dreams
So passionate and wild
So talented it seemed
Everybody wants to be a Gardenia
So beautiful and delicate to touch
Something 'bout the way we loved Gardenia
As the years went by
Her beauty didn't fade
Movies didn't come
She felt so betrayed because
The more she had to give
The less they want to buy
I guess she outlived
Her moment in the sun to be Gardenia
So beautiful and delicate to touch
Something 'bout the way we loved Gardenia
Hadn't seen her for sometime
And I apologized
I said I'd give my youth to you
For the wisdom in your eyes
I wish I'd been there every day
To take good care of you
She said Baby don't you cry
I knew you'd come in time to see Gardenia
And with her fragile hand she said goodbye
Something 'bout the way we loved Gardenia <start> You may be wealthy with more than your share
You may be able to go anywhere
You may have a kingdom and sit on a throne
But you'll still be lonely if you live alone
You may follow the bright lights with a smile on your face
You may travel this whole world and not get any place
A man needs a woman to stick by his side
One who who'll be faithful and much out of his pride
Until you'll find her all the dreams you have known
Will never come true while you live alone
Until you'll find her <start> I know that you've been foolin' round on me right from the start
So I'll take back my ring and I'll take back my heart
When you're tired of foolin' round with 
Come on home and fool around with me
I wasn't foolin' round the day I said I'd do
Many a nights I wished that I've been foolin' too
I know it's foolish taking all this misery when it's you a fool I'll always be
I know that you've been foolin' round on me right from the start
So honey fool around you'll know right where I'm at
Don't worry if I'm lonesome cause I'm used to that
And when you're tired of foolin' round with 
Come on home and fool around with me
I know that you've been foolin' round <start> Yes you're known by the company you keep
You say you're doin' nothing wrong
I don't believe you are
I'm only trying to help you sis
Before you go too far
Cause I think you're an angel
But folks think that you're cheap
Cause you're known by the company you keep
Please listen to your big sister
I feel I know what's best for you
I feel that I must warn you sis
That's the least that I could do
I'm not accusing you of anything
I know it's fun you see
But you're known by the company you keep
The company you keep keeps you out too long
Mom and dad don't go to sleep until you get home
Sis you're gettin' in too deep
You'd better look before you leave
Cause you're known by the company you keep
Sis you're gettin' in too deep
The road of life is steep
And you're known by the company you keep <start> Takes a lot to rock you baby
It takes a lot to make you smile
It takes a lot to rock you baby
You make me crawl the extra mile
So much for wishful thinking
So much for beginner's luck
It takes a lot to rock you baby
When it comes to love you're doubletough
It takes a lot to rock you baby
It takes a lot to make you smile
It takes a lot to rock you baby
You make me crawl the extra mile
Little things that used to please you
Are all the things that I do wrong
It takes a lot to rock you baby
Tried my damnedest all night long
My baby drives a big Rolls Royce
'Cause my baby says she got no choice
My baby wears big ol' diamond rings
Cause my baby says she needs them things
Takes a lot to rock you baby
It takes a lot to make you smile
It takes a lot to rock you baby
You make me crawl the extra mile
Takes a lot to rock you baby
Takes a lot to make you smile
Takes a lot to rock you baby
You make me crawl the extra mile
Takes a lot to rock you baby
Takes a lot to make you smile
Takes a lot to rock you baby
You make me crawl the extra mile
Takes a lot to rock you baby
Takes a lot to make you smile
Takes a lot to rock you baby
Takes a lot to make you smile <start> Carolyn let me tell you what I've heard about a man today
He didn't come home from work and he went away
Till he came to a city bright in the night time like day
There they say he met up with some women dressed in yellow and scarlet
Oh their warm lips like a honeycomb dripped with honey
And there's something about the smell of strange perfume
Made him feel warm and not alone
Yes Carolyn a man will do that sometimes on his own
Sometimes when he's lonely
And I believe a man might do that sometimes out of spite
But Carolyn a man will do that always
When he's treated bad at home
Yes Carolyn a man will do that... <start> She don't know she's beautiful
She don't know she's beautiful
Though time and time I've told her so
Sammy Kershaw 'She Don't Know She's Beautiful'
No one can make me cry
Make me laugh make me smile
Or drive me mad like she does
It's like the curse that is the cure
Better or worse one thing's for sure
It's real love and I don't know what I'd do
If I lost it
Kenny Chesney 'I Lost It'
'Cause anywhere is paradise
When you're with the one you love
Anywhere is a place that's nice
When you're with the one you dream of
Anywhere is paradise
When you're with a love that's true
There's nowhere I'd rather be baby
Than anywhere with you
Your heart and mine joined together
Like hand and glove
We already found our forever
On earth as in Heaven above
So baby anywhere will do for me
For wherever in the world
We'll ever be will always be the land of love
Stefan Anderson 'Anywhere is Paradise'
I want to stand with you on a mountain
I want to bathe with you in the sea
I want to lay like this forever until the sky falls down on me
Savage Garden 'Truly Madly Deeply' <start> Lyin' on our backs
We stared at the stars
Tryin' to count them
Or guess how far
I still remember
The way that it felt
The night we hung our dreams
Out on Orion's belt
The moonlight danced
Out on the water's edge
We started a walk
That hasn't ended yet
Chorus
And step by step
And mile by mile
Taking each turn together
Following the signs
That point to forever
And side by side
True and tenderhearted
We'll finish what we started
The road we have traveled
Has sometimes been steep
And we've crossed troubled waters
That were raging and deep
But with memories to lean on
And love as our guide
There's no path too winding
No river too wide
One foot in front
Of the other each day
Keeping a promise
That two young lovers made
Chorus <start> This old heart has been around it's been up and it's been down
It's been walked on all over town but it still looks for love to come around
It's got memories of the past of love affairs that didn't last
It's been stood up by every girl in town but it still looks for love to come around
 steel 
Are you the next one to come along to give it hope and then do it wrong
Or will it be true love that last and wipe out all the tears from the past
Well this old heart...
Oh yes it still looks for love to come around <start> I grew up in the scantling yards of Wheeling West Virginia
A wheelhouse cub looking for an open door
In the packet ways a Sweeney wed the keel of my Bonita
Just two months from her timbers 'til she moored
I paid the fare in billet on her maiden voyage to Vicksburg
And talked my way to hand the tiller on the course
In her planks I carved a notch and sealed the vow 'Be my Bonita'
And her dowry was my life between the shores
I was born with rouging ways and she steered me like a woman
From the port calls and the bawds that lead me stray
The calliope serenades made the old towns come running
And the boys would gamble shards to pull her chains
The striker's boast would fain me loss about the wrecks the shoals were keeping
And how the old girl's got poor Billy's ransom saved
On the lake at Bistineau she set the wharf at Dixie
With a thousand bales of cotton on her main
As the great raft disappeared the watermark went sinking
And she was stuck right hard a listing on the bank
With the furnace still a blaze I stood my last upon her
Then climbed the prow and took a landsman's trade
'A derelict now Milady' said the watch log I've concorded
'Have the bosun sound us eight bells for the change'
Cause I was born with rouging ways and she steered me like a woman
From the port calls and the bawds that lead me stray
The calliope serenades made the old towns come running
And the boys would gamble shards to pull her chains
And I would take to wider walks so the gin I stopped a drinking
At three scores aloft this crooked frame
The striker's boast would fain me loss about the wrecks the shoals were keeping
And how the old girl's got poor Billy's ransom saved <start> I walked half way across this town
Singing in the pouring rain
I knew someway somehow
I had to see your smiling face
Some people need some time
Some people need their space
But when you're not in my arms
You're too far away 
The love of a woman
The love of a woman like you
The love of a woman
There's nothing so strong and so true
I prayed to God above
And I've searched my whole life through
For the love of a woman
The love of a woman like you
My friends all ask me why
I lay my heart on the line
But somewhere deep down inside
They know exactly why
When it don't go like you plan
There's nothing that hurts so bad
But when it works like it should
There's nothing on earth known to man 
The love of a woman
The love of a woman like you
The love of a woman
There's nothing so strong and so true
I prayed to God above
And I've searched my whole life through
For the love of a woman
The love of a woman like you <start> I walked through the door and in the air I could feel a change
I didn't have to look I knew that suitcase was full of my things
As I opened her letter up here's what I found
My baby bought me a ticket to Lonely Town
Well it's the kind of place you never want to spend the night
Yeah I've been there before I know what it's like
A lot of empty streets to walk they'll take you down
My baby bought me a ticket to Lonely Town
Lonely Town at the end of the road
Lonely Town where the broken hearts go
It's the kind of place old memories like to hang around
My baby bought me a ticket to Lonely Town
Lonely Town at the end of the road
Lonely Town where the broken hearts go
Yeah I opened her letter up tears came down
My baby bought me a ticket to Lonely Town <start> 
Spoken
Way out in the canyons of the West there's a wild river. The Spanish named it San Buenaventura but we knew it as the Green.
It was daylight on the river but we couldn't see the sun
And we couldn't hear our voices through the roar
But we felt the boilin' current and our blood was runnin' cold
As we headed down the canyon of Lodore
And the gods were runnin' with us
On the day we ran the rapids of the Green
Chorus
And we died a thousand times in that forty miles of hell
The longest day of life we'd ever seen
But we lived to tell the story and we know the story well
The day we ran the rapids of the Green
We were thirtytwo in number when we gathered on the shore
And we headed off into the great unknown
But we summoned up our courage an' we formed a mighty team
And we ran that ragin' river all alone
Yeah the gods were runnin' with us
On the day we ran the rapids of the Green
Echoing shouts.
And we hear a thousand echoes on the mighty canyon walls
As we shouted from the waters far below
And we saw the ancient warnings and we heard the ghostly cries
Of the men who ran the river long ago
And we prayed that they were with us
On the day we ran the rapids of the Green
Echoing shouts.
Now the memories are swirlin' in the eddies of our minds
But the waters of the Green are flowin' clear
And the canyon of Lodore will be a long remembered tale
To be told around the campfires through the years
Yeah the gods were runnin' with us
On the day we ran the rapids of the Green
Chorus
And we died a thousand times in that forty miles of hell
The longest day of life we'd ever seen
But we lived to tell the story and we know the story well
The day we ran the rapids of the Green
Echoing shouts. Fade out. <start> Anyone who's ever had a heart
Wouldn't turn around and break it
And anyone who's ever played a part
Wouldn't turn around and hate it
Sweet Jane sweet Jane
Sweet sweet Jane
You're waiting for Jimmy down in the alley
Waiting there for him to come back home
Waiting down on the corner
And thinking of ways to get back home
Sweet Jane sweet Jane
Sweet sweet Jane
Anyone who's ever had a dream
Anyone who's ever played a part
Anyone who's ever been lonely
And anyone who's ever split apart
Sweet Jane sweet Jane
Sweet sweet Jane
Heavenly widened roses
Seem to whisper to me when you smile
Heavenly widened roses
Seem to whisper to me when you smile <start> See the pyramids along the Nile
Watch the sunrise on a tropic isle
Just remember darling all the while
You belong to me
See the marketplace in old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember 'til you're home again
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember 'til you're home again
You belong to me <start> If anyone ever finds a better way to love
It'll be her lovin' me
If anyone ever goes out of their way to show they care
It'll be her lovin' me
She's every woman I've ever known rolled up in one
If I'm ever loved any more she'll be the one
To get it done the way it should be
It'll be her lovin' me
If ever I'm down and out and need someone to love
It'll be her lovin' me
When everyone else is cold and I need someone warm to hold
It'll be her lovin' me
She's every woman I've ever known rolled up in one
If I'm ever loved any more she'll be the one
To get it done the way it should be
It'll be her lovin' me <start> What I don't know might not hurt me
If I stay dumb and no one tells
But if I find out that you've been cheatin'
What I don't know might get you killed
Well death row in prison it don't look half as bad
As a life filled with heartache over you
So if you're a playin' those dirty little games
You better pray that I don't find out the truth
'Cause what I don't know might not hurt me
If I stay dumb and no one tells
But if I find out that you've been cheatin'
What I don't know might get you killed
Well Smith and Wesson juries hold a real mean nasty court
And the verdict that they pass is never slow
So keep on a wearin' that little poker face
'Cause soon enough your cards will have to show <start> Well I know you hate my drinkin'
And the way I talk sometimes
But you hate it most when I don't call at night
And it's just because you lose me
And you worry 'bout your man
You do the best you can with who I am
Chorus
Burnin' both ends of a candle
Can leave one in the dark
And I know what I put you through is hard upon your heart
And it's just that you're concerned for me
Sweetheart I understand
You do the best you can with who I am
You go to church on Sunday
While I'm still home in bed
Sleepin' off the night I had before
And sometimes you say I'm perfect
And sometimes not worth a damn
You do the best you can with who I am
Chorus <start> C'mon baby won't you take my hand
I wanna walk with you a while and tell you what's been on my mind
I know this life can get crazy sometimes
And we forget about the most important things
I know I've been guilty of gettin' caught up
In the rush of today and the worries of tomorrow
But that ain't the point of my existence
No that's not why I'm breathin'
Chorus
Oh I was made for you
For lovin' you baby
Oh I was made for you
For lovin' you lovin' you
Sun and rain and wind and sand
Somehow came together to make this world we're livin' on
Flesh and bone I'm only human
But I know God had a plan for me
And it took me a while to figure it all out
I had to go down some roads I should've never gone down
But you were all the answers
To every question I was askin'
Chorus
Like the glass that holds the wine
The sunset in the western skies
Like the love there in your eyes
Chorus x
I was made for lovin' you
C'mon baby won't you take my hand
Sun and rain wind and sand
Lovin' you
I was made for lovin' you
Oh I was made for you. <start> Mornin' comes she wakes up fore it's light
And starts another day in hell
Tryin' to get her makeup right cause this time she can't tell 'em that she fell
He's sleepin' off another one so she tiptoes around
She don't make a sound
I don't know how she does it
One handed her a coffee cup
One to get the babies in the car
Cross your fingers crank it up hope and pray the piece of shit'll start
Singing with the radio so she don't fall apart
It's just a broken heart
I don't know how she does it
Finally into town the old familiar red light shining in her eyes
Rolls the window down and whispers how you're gonna take back your life
She usually makes a right to work but turns it to the left
I think she might head west <start> 
We've had our stormy weather we've had our sunshine too
We've shared them both together and I'm still here with you
Sometimes I made you happy sometimes I made you blue
But love kept us together and I'm still here with you
No other arms no other lips no other love beside me
No other star up above to guide me
Someday you'll go to heaven as all good angels do
I'll find my way to heaven so I'll be there with you
 no other love but you <start> Back through the years I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of
As she sewed she told a story from the Bible she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will brang you good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss
My coat of many colors that my momma made for me
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money oh I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my momma made for me
So with patches on my britches holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
and my coat of many colors my momma made for me
And oh I couldn't understand that for I thought I was rich
And then I told them of the love my momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story momma told me while she sewed
And why my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes
They didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
One is only poor only if you choose to be
It is true we had no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors momma made for me
Made just for me <start> Beautiful dreamer wake unto me
Starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee
Sounds of the rude world heard in the day
Lull'd by the moonlight have all pass'd a way
Beautiful dreamer queen of my song
List while I woo thee with soft melody
Gone are the cares of life's busy throng
Beautiful dreamer awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer out on the sea
Mermaids are chaunting the wild lorelie
Over the streamlet vapors are borne
Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn.
Beautiful dreamer beam on my heart
E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea
Then will all clouds of sorrow depart
Beautiful dreamer awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer awake unto me <start> In the yard there are two trucks and a sandbox
Honey suckle holds on tightly to the mailbox
Criss cross curtains at the windows speak of cheer
And people think happy people live here
At the door there's a welcome welcome mat
A dog would found a home here and the neighbor's cat
Laundry on the close line if the sun has shone
To complete the picture of home sweet home
It may look like home sweet home but it's just a dwelling
There's an inside story here the outside isn't telling
And every time I pass a house that looks much like our own
Lord I can't help but wonder is home sweet home
 guitar  steel 
Look inside you will see wallpaper on the wall
A plaque that says home sweet home is hanging in the hall
Flowered paper and the plaque that we both hung with care
By now should be removed for it's wrong to hanging there
It may look like home sweet home... <start> I've got you on my mind again you've been there since I don't know when
I said that I'd forget that I'd never look back
That I'd find somebody else so little further down the track
But that same old hurt is back once more it's here since you walked out the door
And as the long day ends and the lonely night begins I've got you on my mind again
Well I said that you'd be out of mind when you've got out of sight
That there'd never be one lonely moment or one sleepless night
But lately I've been finding out just what a heartache means
For every time I close my eyes I see you in my dreams
And I've got you on my mind again...
I've got you on my mind again <start> There's a place where you live
Put you there so I could give
Myself a little space
But you won't ever be erased
From the back of my mind
Back of my mind
I moved on best I could
Father there thought I would
Just a step at a time
When I stop it's always fine
For you in the back of my mind
Back of my mind
Time goes by in the blink of an eye
Healing broken things
Mending broken wings
Day by day the heartache starts to fade
It used to be every thought every dream
Every memory every in between
Now you're gone
Put you're back where you belong
There's a place where you live
Put you there so I could give
Myself a little space
But you won't ever be erased
From the back of my mind
Back of my mind <start> As I went now for to take a little walk
I came upon that Wild Bill Jones
He was a'walkin' and a'talkin' by my true lover's side
And I bid him to leave her alone
He said my age is  too old to be controlled
I pulled my revolver from my side
And I destroyed that poor boy's soul
He reeled and he staggered and he fell to the ground
And then he gave one dying moan
He wrapped his arms around my little girl's neck
Sayin' Honey won't ya take me home
So put them handcuffs on me boys
And lead me to that freightcar gate
I have no friends or relations there
No one for to go my bail <start> I'm the son of a rd generation farmer

She's not perfect but I'm happy I found her
Cause she's as close as I can get to loving you
She doesn't know she's being used and it would break her heart in two
If she knew that she was playing a part I planned for you
I should be ashamed to love her the way that I do
But she's as close as I can get to loving you

You would've proved of the way that she dresses

The only thing better if I was squirting
But there's no one here to love on me today
For the maiden's on holiday

Hoping to avoid certain societal hassles
And I know what they say
But I ain't made of clay
For the maiden's on holiday
Yeah the maiden's on holiday
I ain't nothing but chivalrous
Ain't never been nothing nasty between us
She knows where she stands
On the heart of a broken man

So I might as well go on ahead
And act like a butt
Any ol' way yeah I'm still gonna pay
For the maiden's on holiday
Yeah the maiden's on holiday <start> The streets are cracked
And there's glass everywhere
And a baby stares out
With motherless eyes
Under long gone beauty
On fields of war
Trapped in lament
To the poet's core
Oh where oh where will I be
Oh where oh when that trumpets sounds
Met an Indian boy in Ottawa
He laid me down on a bed of straw
Said don't waste your breath
Don't waste your heart
Don'tblister your heels
Running in the dark
Oh where oh where will I be
Oh where oh when that trumpets sounds
Yeah I like the heat
Of your body laying under me
May your wild lip get you where your going
With your inventions your intentions your laughter
Your forever yearning
Oh where oh where will I be
Oh where oh when that trumpets sounds
I walked to the river
And I walked to the rim
I walked through the teeth of the reaper's grin
I walked to you rolled up in wire
To the other side of desire
Oh where oh where will I be
Oh where oh when that trumpets sounds
Oh where oh where oh where when that trumpet sounds
Oh where oh where oh when that trumpet sounds
Well the heart opens wide like it's never seen love
And addiction stays on tight like a glove
Oh where oh where will I be <start> Woke up this morning in a cold cold sweat
Heart broke and beating out of my chest
I cried out your name against my will
A memory I can't kill
I buried your love alive 
I buried your love alive 
I buried your love alive 
Deep inside me there's a shallow grave
That haunts me every day yeah
I buried your love alive
Getting tired and I don't wanna deal
You left me holding too damn much to feel
So I found a bottle drank some booze
I did what I had to do yeah
I buried your love alive 
I buried your love alive 
I buried your love alive 
It drives me crazy and it makes me cry
Wish I could make it die
I buried your love alive
Yes I did
I got what I wanted I guess
I confess I did not want to let you go
So I buried your love alive
Yeah I buried your love alive
Oh no
Oh I buried your love alive 
Oh no 
Oh no I buried your love alive
Woke up this morning in a cold cold sweat
Heart broke and beating out of my chest
I cried out your name against my will
A memory I can't kill <start> He goes out at night comes home when he wants to
Nobody to tell him what to do yeah
He drinks 'til the doors close
Brings another girl home
In the morning light his tears fall again
Chorus Every day haunted by what might have been
When night time falls he ties one on again
He chose to have his parties and his friends and a life of sin
How much fun it is for him
Coulda settled down coulda had a family
But he broke her heart with all his lies
She lay there dreamin' he sits there drinkin'
The life of the crowd drownin' his troubles away
Chorus <start> Well when you're sitting there in your silk upholstered chair
Talking to some rich folk that you know
Well I hope you won't see me in my ragged company
'Cause you know I could never be alone
Take me down little Susie take me down
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave
Well when you're sitting back in your rose pink Cadillac
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day
I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon
And another girl to take my pain away
Take me down little Susie take me down
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave <start> You placed gold on my finger you brought love like I've never known
You gave life to our children and to me a reason to go on
You're my bread when I'm hungry you're my shelter from troubled winds
You're my anchor in life's ocean but most of all you're my best friend
When I need hope and inspiration you're always strong when I'm tired and weak
I could search this whole world over you'd still be everything that I need
You're my bread when I'm hungry
You're my anchor in life's ocean but most of all you're my best friend <start> Play your fiddle Little Orphan Annie
Play it for the shrimpers and the pirates out to sea
Play it for the hippies down in Mallory Square
If I'm not there won't you play a song for me
We all called her Little Orphan Annie at the playground
Merry go merry go merry go round
Till she picked her fiddle up we always put her down
When she picked her fiddle up
They come for miles around to hear her play
Play your fiddle Little Orphan Annie
Play it for the shrimpers and the pirates out to sea
Play it for the hippies down in Mallory Square

Rag time bands and western swingin'
Sneakin' around with you
Well I like beer and rodeos
Detective books and dominos
Football games and Cheerios
And sneakin' around with you
Chorus
Sneakin' around with you
Goin' around or two
Doin' what lovers do
Whenever they're sneakin' around
I like lots of cash on hand
And dirty jokes about the fullerbrush man
I like stuff I understand
Like sneakin' around with you
You know I like a thrill that has no strings
Friendship that don't ever change
And laughter from the joy of things
And sneakin' around with you
Repeat Chorus
I like drivein picture shows
Kissin' long and lovin' slow
Secret places lovers go
Whenever they're sneakin' around
Ooh I like the crazy things we try
And the sexy things we fantasise
Just makin' out in the broad day light
And sneakin' around with you
nd Chorus
Sneakin' around with you
Keepin' it all brand new
Gettin' the best of you
Whenever we're sneakin' around
Sneakin' around that's all
I'm gonna lay down the law
Watchin' her rise and fall
An' lovin' our sneakin' around
We're just sneakin' around
Aw we're just sneakin' <start> Love starts with a toothbrush
A Bic razor and a Dixie cup
A little splash of aftershave
Before you leave for that first date
I see stars in both your eyes
After that long kiss goodnight
Forever starts with a suitcase
Sneaking out the window to get away
To the car parked by the curb
Gassed up for Gatlinburg
A little chapel and a couple of rings
Will get you two toothbrushes by the bathroom sink
Everything that's anything
Starts out as a little thing
Just needs a little time and room to grow
Step by step day by day
It all adds up along the way
And the next thing that you know
Life starts with a little house
A corner lot on the edge of town
A weed eater and a picket fence
You think it's good as the getting gets
Then she wakes up feeling bad
You both wonder what's up with that
Everything that's anything
Starts out as a little thing
Just needs a little time and room to grow
Step by step day by day
It all adds up along the way
And the next thing that you know
One night around eight o'clock
You scrub him down and you dry him off
You pick him up and put his little feet
On the stool by the bathroom sink
You grab the crest and a Dixie cup
It all hits you as he opens up
Love starts with a toothbrush <start> When you feel like you're in love don't just stand there
When you see that moon above don't just stand there
You gotta laugh and dance and sing you gotta get that gal a ring
When you feel like you're in love don't just stand there
When the moon is shinin' bright in your Saturday night
You're not havin' any fun then maybe you're out with the wrong one
When you feel like you're in love hold her tighter
And the moon and stars above all shine brighter
You gotta laugh and dance and sing you gotta get that gal a ring
When you feel like you're in love don't just stand there
 steel  guitar 
 <start> Picking for the wait staff again baring my soul up on stage
Where my guitar's my only friend
Slurring the words to a hit song from a bottle that never ends
Mama says Roy get home boy before the devil does ya in
Lord don't let me die in a cheap motel
Gideon's Bible on the nightstand
Can't save me from the gates of hell
Nothing more to offer no more soul to sell
Lord don't let me die in a cheap motel
Took 'em from their homes when they were young
Five times I married had kids with every one
Never raised a hand in anger scarred 'em just the same
Mama said Roy get home boy you're playing the devils game
Lord don't let me die in a cheap motel
Gideon's Bible on the nightstand
Can't save me from the gates of hell
Nothing more to offer no more soul to sell
Lord don't let me die in a cheap motel
Washed in the blood of the lamb
Laying in the bathtub with a pistol in my hand
Waiting on the reaper to make my final stand
Mama said Roy get after boy you're playing in the devil's band
Lord don't let me die in a cheap motel
Gideon's Bible on the nightstand
Can't save me from the gates of hell
Nothing more to offer no more soul to sell
Lord don't let me die in a cheap motel
Lord don't let me die in a cheap motel <start> I never had time to wonder if you were happy or sad
I never had the time to ask you what kind of day you had
For I was too busy to notice that we were drifting apart
Never had time to see just what you meant to me
And now I've got nothing but time
I never had time to tell you it was nice just having you near
I never had the time to look for some small way to say that I care
The time just flew and I didn't see that I was breaking your heart
Never had time to see just what you meant to me
And now I've got nothing but time <start> I've been to town I've walked the highways and the harbors too
I've done some things I never thought I'd ever do
Now as I stand here looking down at you
You ask me why it is I frown I guess it's cause I've been to town
I've been to town beyond the boulevard and down the beach
I've learned some things that only time can teach
For instance love is more than just a speech
It's got to find a common ground I know because I've been to town
Don't tell me any more lies I can't waste any more years
I've seen my image in your eyes dissolve in disappointed tears
I've been to town you ask me do I know the Milky Way
I do and furthermore I'd like to say it isn't milky white it's dirty gray
Especially when your world breaks down I know because I've been to town <start> Don't get no attention from the people on the street
But they don't even see us they just step right on our feet
Just two unnoticed people in this great big world are we
And when I think about it yes that's all we'll ever be
But I got you and you got me and if they look they can see that we don't care
'Cause honey I've got you and you've got me
And baby that's all we will ever need
Looking through the window of a fancy diamond store
Going window shopping for the things we can't afford
Well there's people all around us with their noses in the air
But I got you and you got me and if they look they can see that we don't care
'Cause I've got you and you've got me and baby that's all we will ever need <start> I heard the front door closing softly as I weaken from my sleep
With the last touch of her lips Lord like a whisper on my cheek
And I cursed the sun for rising for the worst Lord is yet to come
'Cause this morning she's just leaving but come sundown she'll be gone
See the lipstick on the pillow that I placed beneath her head
And the soft sheets still feel warm Lord where she lay upon my bed
And it hurts to know it's over and the hurt Lord has just begun
Cause this morning she's just leaving but come sundown she'll be gone <start> Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set set me free oh lonesome me
A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool is blind and just can't see oh lonesome me
I'll bet she's not like me she's out and fancy free
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms
Well there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I've thought of everything from A to Z oh lonesome me
 strings  guitar 
Well there must be some way I can lose...
Oh lonesome me <start> Each time I dial your number I never get an answer
It seems like you're avoiding me
I can't take unhappy endings so I just keep pretending
You'll see the light eventually
Can't stop my heart from breaking can't stop my hands from shaking
Can't keep my eyes from crying can't believe your love is dying
Can't stop the rain from falling no answer when I'm calling
My love it's so confusing it's such a heartache losin' you
Feels like some tragic movie please say you'll come back to me
Dreamin' of you night after night
I'm havin' trouble sleepin
Your memory is keepin' these feelings runnin' through my mind
Can't stop my heart from breaking can't stop my hands from shaking
Can't keep my eyes from crying can't believe your love is dying
Can't stop the rain from falling no answer when I'm calling
My love it's so confusing it's such a heartache losin' you
It's such a heartache I don't know what to do
It's such a heartache and it's tearin' me in two
You took away the dream I wanted more than anything
Can't stop my heart from breaking can't stop my hands from shaking
Can't keep my eyes from crying can't believe your love is dying
Can't stop the rain from falling no answer when I'm calling
My love it's so confusing it's such a heartache losin' you
Can't stop my heart from breaking can't stop my hands from shaking
Can't keep my eyes from crying can't believe your love is dying
Can't stop the rain from falling no answer when I'm calling
My love it's so confusing it's such a heartache losin' you <start> I walk in the room is bare I close my eyes pretending you're there
I feel your hand pressing mine your soft sweet lips pressing mine
And I'm making excuses why I can't stay but I find that I'm slowly melting away
And I can't resist the thrill of your touch
Cause I've loved you so long and I've loved you so much I'm only human
 guitar 
I open my eyes the dream is gone I realize I've got to go on
I can't live my life on your memory I've got to forget you I've got to be free
So I say that it's easy and easy it seems
Then I close my eyes and look back in my dream
And I still can't resist the thrill of your touch
Cause I've loved you so long and I've loved you so much I'm only human <start> We don't ever stay mad for long
And I guess I've always liked that 'bout us
We usually end up on the floor laughin'
Makin' fun of whatever it was
Passions run high and it might seem like sometimes
We don't get along
Baby that's just the way we do it
Fight a little fight but we get through it
When you're lovin' like this you hold on to it
Baby that's just the way we do it
If we hold back on what we're feelin'
We run the danger of growin' apart
Everybody knows that's how love goes
From good to bad in the beat of a heart
As long as we talkin' nobody's walkin' out
Right or wrong
Baby that's just the way we do it
Fight a little fight but we get through it
When you're lovin' like this you hold on to it
Baby that's just the way we do it
Baby that's just the way we do it
Fight a little fight but we get through it
When you lovin' like this you hold on to it
Baby that's just the way
Baby that's just the way we do it
Baby that's just the way we do it
Fight a little fight but we get through it
When you're lovin' like this you hold on to it
Baby that's just the way we do it
Baby we know what we're fighting for
Ain't nobody walking out that door
Baby that's just the way we do it
Fight a little fight but we get through it
When you're lovin' like this you hold on to it
Baby that's just the way we do it <start> I wish I had button eyes and a red felt nose
A shaggy cotton skin and just one set of clothes
Sittin' on a shelf in a local department store
With no dreams to dream and nothin' to be sorry for
Chorus
I wish I was a teddy bear
Not livin' or lovin' nor goin' nowhere
I wish I was a teddy bear
And I'm wishin' that I hadn't fallen in love with you
I wish I had a wooden heart and a sawdust mind
Then your memory wouldn't come around hurtin' all the time
I'd have a sewedon smile and a painted twinkle in my eye
And I never would have ever had to learn how to cry
Chorus
I wish I had a string you could pull to make me say
Hi I'm Teddy  ain't it a lovely day
Then I'd know every time I spoke the words were right
And none would know the mess I made of my life
Chorus
And I'm wishin' that I hadn't fallen in love with you <start> I can be your midnight are you up every time that he does he does you like he does
I can let you dry your tears tell you what you wanna hear
but when you've had enough
baby I I can be that shot of whiskey your memory Novocain
I can be the sunshine shining through the rain
let me be the on addiction running in your veins
you don't have to hurt no more
baby I can ease your pain
baby I can ease your pain
I can't read your mind girl its up to you
We can take the edge off if that's what's you wanna do
Bring your misery .. lay it all on me
You don't need no  proof
Baby I am
I can be that shot of whiskey your memory Novocain
I can be the sunshine shining through the rain
let me be the one addiction running in your veins
you don't have to hurt no more
baby I can ease your pain
baby I can ease your pain
come on let me fix you up let me be your favorite drug
come on let me fix you up let me be your favorite drug
come on let me fix you up let me be your favorite drug
come on let me fix you up
Baby I am
I can be that shot of whiskey your memory Novocain
I can be the sunshine shining through the rain
let me be the one addiction running in your veins
you don't have to hurt no more
baby I can ease your pain
baby I can ease your pain <start> She's back in town
Haven't seen her yet
But I know that that won't last
Soon I'll turn around
And be face to face
With a feeling from my past
Chorus
She's an old weakness
From a place I fell
She's an old heartache
One that time didn't heal too well
It's an old story
'Bout a love gone wrong
Just an old weakness
Coming on strong
My hands still shake
And my heart still aches
Just knowing she's this close
Those steel blue eyes
And the way she smiles
Are the things I fear the most
Chorus
I know the truth is showing
I know I should be going home
Chorus
Just an old weakness
Coming on strong <start> I don't watch a lot of TV
But I think I know what's good
What's good is what we've got
What's bad is that we've not
Tried to show each other proof
But I think that I hold you
Maybe then you'd sing along
We could walk down to the beach
Get swept up by the sea
And never tell them where we'd gone
I will search for you in the shadows
I will search for you in the light
I will search for you in the morning
I will search for you in the night
Don't have to sit in stony silence
While the rest of the world fights
We could gather up our fears
And take them to the pier
Throw them out like rice
We can stand upon the rooftops
Shout at the top of our lungs
Starting with today we won't be afraid
Of growing old and dying young
I will search for you in the shadows
I will search for you in the light
I will search for you in the morning
I will search for you in the night
I will search for you in the shadows
I will search for you in the light
I will search for you in the morning
I will search for you in the night <start> I thought you and me were something special
Thought you thought that way too
Now I know that this old boy just ain't the
Best you'll think you'll ever do
Chorus
It ain't cool to be crazy about you
It ain't suave or debonair
To let you know I care
Like I do
It ain't smart to be so reckless with my heart
 Should've known right from the start
I'd end up like a fool
Believe me it ain't cool
All of my friends they tried to tell me
What and what not to do
It took a while for them to sell me
But finally they got through
Chorus <start> In the time it takes to tell you
I could show you
In the time it takes to wonder
You could know
Everything inside my heart
Waiting for this dance to start
All you gotta do
All you gotta do is let go...
In the time it takes to want me
You can have me
And you'd never have to ask how much I care
Love for me is not some game
Any time you call my name
I'll be there
Like a star that's traveled years to shine
Like a song that wants to hear the rhyme
In the time it takes
In the time it takes
Like a spark that makes your soul ignite
Only love knows when the moments right
In the time it takes
In the time it takes
Nothing I wouldn't give
Knowing I couldn't live without you
And if I get my wish
Heavens gonna help me
Heavens gonna make you mine
 <start> Seems like only yesterday we fell in love just barely old enough to be sincere
Back then I thought I loved you all I could
But I've grown to love you more through the years
Through the years I've had you to keep me happy
Hand in hand we face tomorrow with no fear
Side by side we've walked the road of life together
And each step has grown us closer through the years
Now we've raised all our children and they're gone once again you and I are all alone
But I never will be lonely while you're here
Cause we've got a love that's lasted through the years
Through the years...
And each step has grown us closer through the years <start> I'm a sad lonely man who walks in the night
Stopped here at your tavern it's the last one in sight
I have no destination I hope you won't mind
I'm a sad lonely man that love left behind
To me nothing matters there's no hope left within
The one love I live for is gone with the wind
These tears you see falling don't blame on the wine
I'm a sad lonely man that love left behind
 steel 
My clothes I have tattered but these lines in my face
Were put there by heartaches that time won't erase
I can't claim the future but the past is all mine
I'm a sad lonely man that love left behind
To me nothing matters... <start> Everybody knows that the best kind of parties
Wind up round a kitchen with an old wood stove
someone starts humming
and we all start singing
to the squeezebox fiddle
and the old banjo.
The potluck cover charge
is a poor boy
or a keg full of hurricane
while we laissez les bon temps roulez
Chorus
We're gunna wear out the floor
in the kitchen and the hallway
to the rhythm of the washing machine
Two spoons six strings and a Cajun song is all we need
for a good ole' Creole soiree in the kitchen
Grandma's got gumbo boiling on the burning
while the horse hair's flying from her fiddlin' bow
All the little kiddies are sucking on Huck a Bucks
just one more then it's fais dodo
We'll bend the beams in the ceiling of the basement
to the rhythm of the tambourine
while we laissez les bon temps roulez
The living room ain't where the living is
The living room ain't got no soul
The party is always in the kitchen
Cause the kitchen is the heart of the home
We're gunna wear out the floor
in the kitchen and the hallway
to the rhythm of the washing machine
For a good ole Country Party
for a good ole' Creole soiree in the kitchen <start> You were mine for just a while now you're puttin' on the style
And you've never once looked back at your home across the track
You're the gossip of the town but my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it on the ground pick me up on your way down
Pick me up on your way down when you're blue and all alone
When their glamour starts to bore you come on back where you belong
You may be their pride and joy but they'll find another toy
Then they'll take away your crown pick me up on your way down
They have changed your attitude made you haughty and so rude
Your new friends can take the blame underneath you're still the same
When you've learned these things are true I'll be waiting here for you
As you tumble to the ground pick me up on your way down
Pick me up on your way down... <start> Seven years with the wrong woman is more than a man can stand
Seven years with the wrong woman will wreck most any good men
Seven years with the wrong woman it's the same in the mountain or dale
She'll stay awake all night tryin' to start a fight then have you thrown in the jail
Seven years with the wrong woman is punishment there is bad
Seven years with the wrong woman will drive most any man mad
When you married the wrong woman there is only one thing you can do
Dig yourself a hole crawl in the hole then put the ground over you
Listen boys if you're thinking of marriage take warning to what I tell
Don't you marry the wrong woman it's worse than living in jail
Seven years with the wrong woman it'll end you and turn your hair gray
They say love is blind but search till you find a face you can stand every day <start> Dear heart I wish you were here to warm this night
And dear heart it seems like a year since you've been out of my sight
A single room a table for one it's a lonesome town alright
But soon I'll kiss you hello at our front door
And dear heart I want you to know I'll leave your arms never more
A single room a table for one <start> Whose Irish eyes are heavenly blue whose Irish smile is like a morning dew
Who do I see in all my dreams Marie Mary Patricia Eileen
Whose precious love will never grow old giving to me a gladness untold
Who stands by me through sunshine and rain Marie Mary Patricia Eileen
Four pretty names for one pretty girl gives me the joy I seek through the world
Whose helping hand is always there lending her smile so sweet and fair
Who is my life my everything Marie Mary Patricia Eileen <start> She said when she found me I was barely hanging on
To the memory of a love that had been long gone
There must have been somebody else I don't remember who it is
'Cause she's got a way of makin' me forget
When she takes me in her arms I get lost in time
She takes complete control of my heart and my mind
I'm not haunted by the past old memories or regrets
Oh she's got a way of makin' me forget
She's taught me that tomorrow is a reason to live
Don't blame and accuse just love and forgive
Now every grudge I ever had no longer exists
'Cause she's got a way of makin' me forget
When she takes me in her arms I get lost in time
She takes complete control of my heart and my mind
I'm not haunted by the past old memories or regrets
Oh she's got a way of makin' me forget
Oh she's got a way of makin' me forget <start> I'm going down this road feeling bad
I'm going down this road feeling bad
I'm going down this road feeling bad lord lord
And I ain't agonna be treated this away
I'm down in the jailhouse on my knees
Down in the jailhouse on my knees
Down in the jailhouse on my knees lord lord
And I ain't agonna be treated this away
They feed me on corn bread and beans
They feed me on corn bread and beans
They feed me on corn bread and beans lord lord
And I ain't agonna be treated this away
Got two dollar shoes on my feet
Got two dollar shoes on my feet
Two dollar shoes they hurt my feet lord lord
And I ain't agonna be treated this away
It takes a ten dollar shoe to fit my foot
It takes a ten dollar shoe to fit my foot
It takes a ten dollar shoe to fit my foot Great God
And I ain't agonna be treated this away
I'm going where the weather fits my clothes
I'm going where the weather fits my clothes
I'm going where the weather fits my clothes lord lord
And I ain't agonna be treated this away <start> As I went out walking through Austin's fair city
Through Austin's fair city one morning in May
Was there I spoke to a handsome cowboy
All wrapped in white linen and cold as the clay
I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy
These words he did speak as I boldly stepped by
Come sit done beside me and hear my sad fortune
For I'm shot in the breast and I know I must die
Was once in the saddle I used to go dashing
Was once in the saddle I used to ride on
But then turned to drink and then to card playing
Was shot by a gambler and now I must die
Oh Beat the drum slowly oh play the fife lowly
Play the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the graveyard and throw the sod o'er me
For I'm just a poor cowboy and I know I've done wrong
Go break the news gently to my gray haired mother
Whisper it softly to my sister so dear
But there is yet one far dearer than mother
Who'd fairly weep if she knew I were here
Come gather round me that set of jolly cowboys
To listen to me softly as I live my sad fate
And each of you ride and take warning
And quit the wild roving before it's too late
Six jolly cowboys to balance my coffin
Six pretty girls Lord to sing me a song
Take me to the graveyard and throw the sod o'er me
For I'm just a poor cowboy and I know I've done wrong
Beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly
Play the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the graveyard and throw the sod o'er me
For I'm just a poor cowboy and I know I've done wrong <start> Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us never molested though in the wrong
Farther along we'll know all about it farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine we'll understand it all by and by
When death has come and taken our loved ones it leaves our home so lonely and drear
While they are others living about us living so wicked year after year
Farther along we'll know all about it... <start> I grew up near what they call the flats
Ain't too many people knows where its at
Cant hear the highway cant see a way out
I guarantee it ain't nothin' worth cryin' about
Daddy left us all back in '
Left us all wonderin' what it was we done
Id stand in the yard and stare down the road
I guess I must have missed how I just don't know
Chorus
Got the broken promises
Got the broken home
Don't break yourself on a
Heart of stone
I married a girl I met in Tennessee
The baby didn't make it so neither did we
I still think about her but shes fadin' fast
It don't do no good dwellin' on the past
Chorus
Well I call momma every now and then
To say I'm comin' home but I don't know when
Well I ran into daddy but its been so long
I don't tell momma I don't let on
Chorus
Well I got drunk with daddy just the other night
He said he was glad to see I turned out alright
I hear people sayin' like father like son
Don't think about it much but I worry bout it some
A heart of stone
Don't break yourself
On a heart of stone
Don't break yourself
On a heart of stone <start> I got my old guitar and some fishin' poles
So baby fill that cooler full of something cold
Don't ask just pack and we'll hit the road runnin'
Honey what do you say
I got just enough money and just enough gas
So pick a place on the map we can get to fast
Where the white sandy beach meets water like glass
And if the tide carries us away
Baby we'll roll with it
Won't think about it too much
Baby let's just go with it
Get out of this ordinary everyday rut
And if we get swept away by one of those perfect days
When the sun is sinking low at dusk
And wind up a little deeper in love
Baby lets roll with it
We get so caught up in catching up
Trying to pay the rent trying to make a buck
That don't leave much time for time for us
And ain't life too short for that
So open up that bag of pig skins you bought
At the Exxon station the last time we stopped
And you can kick back baby and dance in your socks
On the windshield to some radio rock
And we'll roll with it
Won't think about it too much
Baby let's just go with it
And get out of this ordinary everyday rut
And we get swept away by one of those perfect days
When the sun is sinking low at dusk
And wind up a little deeper in love
Baby we'll roll with it
Won't think about it too much
Sometimes you gotta go with it
Get out of this ordinary everyday rut
And it won't be no thing if it starts to rain
And we have to wait it out in the truck
We might wind up a little deeper in love
So baby lets roll with it
Baby lets roll with it
Baby we'll roll with it
Baby we'll roll with it <start> Just because your love is gone don't think my life won't still go on
Because you wanted to have your fling it's not the end of everything
The world still turns the sun still shines there's lots of guys for hearts like mine
One never knows what tomorrow might bring it's not the end of everything
Just look at the things I still possess like a heart that is filled with emptiness
And the life of pure unhappiness two arms that hold just loneliness
My rule's overflowing with blue blue songs think of the nights I can spend all alone
And all of the days I can just sit and dream it's not the end of everything
It's not the end of everything <start> I lay down with you
I lay down with you
You told me not to
And I feel so strange
What is happiness
What is happiness
But too wrong from this
Take me out to Soho
Buy me a rum and a coke
And help me forget
Myself myself for an evening
Myself for an evening <start> You make my eyes run over all the time
You're happy when I'm out of my mind
You don't love me but you won't let me be
Don't you ever get tired of hurtin' me

You must think I look bad with a smile
For you haven't let me wear one
In such a long long while
Still I keep running back why must this be
Don't you ever get tired of hurtin' me
Chorus <start> I got drunk in Austin Texas I missed my plane in North Carolina
Spent all of my money on a long distance call
Huntsville Prison walls so high I'm so lonesome I could die
You could make a grown man cry if you wanted to
Say goodbye to Houston for me give my best to San Antone
Tell Dallas there's a change in plans I won't be comin' home
Dallas lives in Winston Salem we got married in West Virginia
Then we moved to Texas on a fifty acre farm
I robbed a bank and shot a man ended up in Birmingham
But I guess I tipped my hand and wound up in the pen
Say goodbye to Houston for me...
Houston is my oldest daughter says she's leaving for New York City
She's gonna make her living reaching for a star
San Antone's my only son please don't tell him what I've done
Or that I had to use my gun for that I killed a man
Say goodbye to Houston for me...
Say goodbye to Houston for me...
Say goodbye to Houston for me... <start> Dear sweetheart as I write to you my heart is filled with pain
For if those things I hear are true I'll never see you again
They tell me darlin' that tonight you'll wed another man
But if you do I'll tell you true my boat will never land
You promised that you would wait for me that nothin' could come between
That in my arms someday you'd be my wife and lovely Queen
I built you that cozy home and made a garden there
And planted too with my own hands sweet flowers rich and fair
My future hopes are placed in you you've been my guidin' star
Please write and tell me that you're true to the sailor who waits afar
Just tell me that you love me yet still long to be my wife
I'll return and then we'll wed and live a happy life <start> Meet her in Miami
Conversation turned to wine
We talked and we talked
Yeah we hit it off just fine
Stayed down by the water
Slept beneath the stars
We laughed and we danced
Made love in the sand
I held her in my arms
But I couldnt make her stay
California called her away
And tonight the moon turned as blue as the sea
And she left Miami and Me
Now shes in San Fransico
Maybe Montery
I started to call
But I put it off
Hey what can I say
Im up in New York City
But my hearts down in the Keys
It just aint fair
I should be there
Holdin her on that beach
But I couldnt make her stay
California called her away
And tonight the moon turned as blue as the sea
And she left Miami and Me
They say a womans heart is an ocean of secrets
And that may be why Ill never know the reason
That I couldnt make her stay
California called her away
Thats the night the moon turned as blue as the sea
And she left Miami and Me
Yeah thats the night the moon turned as blue as the sea
And she left Miami and me
She left Miami and me
She left Miami and me <start> Now come and listen to my story
A story that I know is true
A little rose that bloomed in Georgia
With hair of gold and a heart so true
Way down in the blue ridge mountains
Way down where the tall pines grow
Lives my sweetheart of the mountains
She's my little Georgia rose
Her mother left her with another
A carefree life she had planned
The baby now she is a lady
The one her mother couldn't stand
We often sing those songs together
I watched her do her little part
She smiled at me when I would tell her
That she was my sweetheart <start> Silent night holy night
All is calm all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ the Saviour is born
Silent night holy night
Son of God love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at Thy birth
Jesus Lord at Thy birth  <start> I'll keep holdin' on though you've stopped trying
Cause I think it's sad something beautiful's dying
And we both said that forever was the way true love should be
So I'll be holdin' on when you let go of me
I'll be holdin' on when you let go I'm just wonderin' why you don't love me anymore
And that something so good's gone bad my mind just won't believe
So I'll be holding on when you let go of me
I'll be holding on darling holding on I'll be holding on when you let go of me
Yes that something... <start> That year the spring was six months long and love
Could do no wrong for love to open up the answers
The sun was stapled to the sky a junior prom July
And we at center stage where the dancers.
I knew you when the air was cold I'm there again
My dress was blue and it lay across the chair
Cause I love you I knew you well your heart
Could melt like caramel your eyes was deep like
The sun muddy stream where that tadpole stream
Child begin child you sleep
That year the fog would climb the beach and wrapped
Us out in preach from search lights that the sky
Would sending
I knew you first I knew you best I knew from the rest
I knew you when the spring was ending
As time takes hold you maybe we're growing old
But in my pray I will you see to remain the time
Is sure of now and then it's only me <start> I've heard you secretly crying
You've seen me hit the wall
Over the years we've shared some tears
But moments made up for it all
The moment we traded our rings and our souls
The moment our children turned one breath old
Love is forever but it's held together
By moments of heaven on earth
First time I ever kissed you has never quite left my lips
The stars that we shared
The moon in your hair all of those movies we missed
The moment we traded our rings and our souls
The moment our children turned one breath old
Love is forever but it's held together
By moments of heaven on earth
Some moments just flash through the window of life
Waving the glow of the father's life
A small gift of grace
A moment to taste what heaven is gonna be like
The moment we traded our rings and our souls
The moment our children turned one breath old
Love is forever but it's held together
By moments of heaven on earth
Just moments of heaven just moments of heaven on earth <start> If I ever needed love I need it now
Honey why can't you see me through me
When I pretend that I'm to strong to bend
This heart can mend a lover or a friend
Stop acting like you never knew me
How you fantasize telling little lies
Fairy tales are all you ever see
Don't you realize how you hypnotize
Anyone who's fool enough to look back into your eyes
And fall in love with you
If I ever wanted someone babe I need you now
Please don't place your self above me
Just out of reach when you could learn to teach
Me to begin loving you again
Why are you doing this to me <start> Get out of bed you sleepy head
And shake a leg or two
The sun is up pour some coffee in the cup
The rent is way past due
Could I rewind the hands of time
Back to my wasted youth
I'd lay the days all out in a line
And waste my time with you
The freeway's like a parkin' lot
And I'm runnin' low on time
I'm workin' double shifts to find
I'm barely scrapin' by
What I would give if I could live
The way the rich folks do
Just kickin' back in my cadillac
And wastin' time with you
We could take the time so hard to find
And wrestle it to the floor
Then wake up and do nothin' like it's never been done before
Sometimes at night my thoughts ignite
In dreams of great escape
A couple sticks of dynamite
And no more workin' late
I'm sure the cops would understand
They're workin' people too
And I'd like to take this chance to thank
Those hard workin' boys in blue <start> I will hold my head up high
You will never see me cry
I'll smile and say I'm good
But I would fall apart if I could
I'm inside out shot through the center
Feel the scar of where you entered
Took my life and turned it upside down
I'm burned to ashes split down the middle
If anyone asks it hurt just a little
I died inside the day I let you go
But I will never let you know
All this time the sky was lying
They say that the moon don't shine
It's just the light from a star
Well maybe that's the way we are
I'm inside out shot through the center
Feel the scar of where you entered
Took my life and turned it upside down
I'm burned to ashes split down the middle
If anyone asks it hurt just a little
I died inside the day I let you go
But I will never let you know <start> In the night when you call
I'll be waiting by the phone
To hear it all
And I won't leave until you call
'Cause baby I don't wanna miss the way you fix me
Speak speak like you never spoke before
Walk with me through an open door
'Cause then it all goes away
Eh eh eh
Fall fall with me from the highest ledge
Bring me down from the broken edge
Walk away with my heart
Eh eh eh
Take me back in open arms
Take me back to a brand new start
And fix me
You look right when you call
I'll be waiting by the phone
To hear it all
And I won't leave until you call
Baby I don't wanna miss the way you fix me
Ooooh mhmmm you fix me
Wait wait till the morning comes
And then take me through it all again
'Cause baby we may want it more
I finally feel I can turn the page
Feel like my worlds about to change
And I want to do it again do it again
In the night when you call
I'll be waiting by the phone
To hear it all again
And I won't leave until you call
'Cause baby I don't wanna miss the way you fix me
Mhmmm
You fix me
Ohhh
Take me back in your open arms
And take me back to a brand new start
And fix me <start> AN HOUR AND A SIXPACK

RECORDED BY CAL SMITH
I just got home and found a note that you left lying on my pillow case
You say you're leaving me you found another man to take my place
And then you wish me luck and say you hope that I'll get over you somehow
Honey I won't even know your name an hour and a sixpack from now
You're an hour and a sixpack away from not existing anymore
An hour and a sixpack and I won't care how much I cared before
Watch the clock popthetops swallow all the pain and then the pride
And with all that we had going baby don't it hurt you knowing
My love is just an hour and a sixpack wide
I never was the kind of man who liked to stand and rummage through the ashes
When it's gone then it's gone take it out and leave it where the trash is
If you think I'll be missing you this time tomorrow baby drop around
I'm an hour and a sixpack away from being over you right now
You're an hour and a sixpack away from not existing anymore
An hour and a sixpack and I won't care how much I cared before
Watch the clock popthetops smile and settle back and go to sleep
And with all that we had going don't it hurt you baby knowing
My love is just an hour and a sixpack deep <start> My dirty little secrets not a secret anymore
I cant even keep it from myself
Everybodys secret looks the same behind closed doors
If I had only known before I fell
Can you even recognize the better part of me
Under cover in disguise where I want to be
Anywhere but me
My dirty little secret spills out on the kitchen floor
As you pour your second cup of tea
I cant clean it up the way I always did before
On the sly so no one else can see
Can you even recognize the better part of me
In my lies and alibis where I want to be
Anywhere but me
If Im good enough for you am I good enough for me
Can you even recognize the heart inside my sleeve
What is left for me to hide whos left to believe
Anyone but me <start> Written by billy burnette and rafe van hoy.
Life's too short to go too long like this
Forget where you came from or came here with
Let's talk some serious business
Like just one kiss from your sweet lips

Are you with me baby
We're waistin' precous time
Are you with me baby
Then put your little hand in mine
We're burning moonlight baby
Please don't let me down
Are you with me now
Don't wanna make a scene
Don't wanna cause a big fuss
I got a little feeling 'bout the two of us
My heart's beatin' hard and it's about to bust
Let's leave this party in a cloud of dust


As far as I can see we got an open road
It can go on forever if we choose to go
It's not a dream if you believe it's so
There's just one thing that I need to know <start> 
Flowers speak louder than words they say whether the red white or blue
Flowers speak louder than words they say that's why I send them to you
I send a bouquet of flowers hoping that they touch your heart
Well the flowers speak louder than words my dear tell me what keeps us apart

I send a bouquet of flowers
 <start> Laceup boots and faded jeans
A homemade sandwich and a half a jug of tea
Average Joe average pay
Same ol' end same ol' day
But there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer
Kind of glue that sticks this world together
Hands of steel and cradle of the Promised Land
God bless the working man
All week long making a living
Life keeps takin' he keeps giving
Behind the scene below the grade
Hardly noticed but part of everything
But there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer
Kind of glue that sticks this world together
Hands of steel and cradle of the Promised Land
God bless the working man
He gives his life then fades away
Another young man takes his place
Average Joe average pay
The same ol' end and the same old' day
But there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer
Kind of glue that sticks this world together
Hands of steel and cradle of the Promised Land
No there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer
Kind of glue that sticks this world together
Hands of steel and cradle of the Promised Land
God bless the working man
The working man
Oh the working man and woman <start>  <start> If I could have the world and all it owns
A thousand kingdoms a thousand thrones
If all the earth were mine to hold
With wealth my only goal
I'd spend my gold on selfish things
Without the love that Your life brings
Just a little bit more is all I'd need
'Til life was torn from me
I'd rather be in the palm of Your hand
Though rich or poor I may be
Faith can see right through the circumstance
Sees the forest in spite of the trees
Your grace provides for me
If I should walk the streets no place to sleep
No faith in promises You keep
I'd have no way to buy my bread
With a bottle for my bed
But if I trust the One who died for me
Who shed His blood to set me free
If I live my life to trust in You
Your grace will see me through
I'd rather be in the palm of Your hand
Though rich or poor I may be
Faith can see right through the circumstance
Sees the forest in spite of the trees
If I could have the world
If I could have the world and all it owns <start> One Room Apartment So Crowded  Small
The tomcats' meowing and the babies all squall.
My Sister has a boyfriend  but when he comes to call
She sits on the sofa and he stands out in the Hall
someday they'll marry and raise a family
In our one Room Apartment they'll live in harmony <start> I saw the picture in Sunday's paper of a honeymoon in old Mexico
There my sweet Judy was smiling sweetly in the arms of my best friend Joe
Sweet sweet Judy I want you happy even though I miss you so
Adios husta luego God be with you wherever you go
I'll never hear the church bells ringing I'll never have a honeymoon
And when they find me they'll understand I left this world by my own hand
Sweet sweet Judy I want you happy <start> Lovers live longer.
Lovers live right.
Lovers get crazy.
Deep in the night.
Lovers live longer
So let's stay together.
'Cause the way that we're going
We might live forever.
Babe I read it in the news today.
How to live to be a ripe old age.
Funny thing is what they had to say
I something we've known all along.
Lovers live longer.
Lovers live right.
Lovers get crazy
Deep in the night.
Lovers live longer.
So lets stay together.
'Cause the way that we're going
We might live forever.
I play your body like a fine guitar.
You light me up just like a shining star.
Let 'em guess how young or old we are.
And we'll just love our lives away.
Lovers live longer.
Lovers live right.
Lovers get crazy
Deep in the night.
Lovers live longer
So let's stay together.
'Cause the way that we're going
We might live forever.
Lovers live longer
So let's stay together.
'Cause the way that we're going
We might live forever. <start> I've been gone for so long
And how I missed you
My heart was aching for home
And then one night as I lay down
Somewhere far from you
I dreamt that I heard you call my name
But my mind was playing games
I knew right then that I'd return
To where I was before
And I was so tired of being away
That I just couldn't stay anymore
What did I ever come here for
Oh no no no no no
What did I ever come here for
I thought if I showed up in the night
In my best disguise
There at your doorway in your porch light
That you would look into my eyes
And you would realize who I am
Put your arms around me
You're gonna love me so much more
Than you ever did before
What did I ever come here for
Oh no no no no no
What did I ever come here for
It wasn't too long before
I showed up at your door
I'd been gone a thousand miles
I didn't know how much more I could stand
If I could stand at all
You said I looked like I'd been through World War Two
And my soul was worn right through
I thought you would read my mind
I thought you'd ask me to stay
You'd never turn me away like before
But you closed your door anyway <start> Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand.
She had ruby red lips coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table
And as she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine.
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered I need you
Take me away from here and be my man.
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.
Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a guy with a drink in his hand.
He had bay blue eyes coal black hair
And a smile that a girl understands.
Then he came and sat down at my table
And as he placed his hands over mine
I found my self wanting to kiss him
For temptation was flowing like wine.
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and he whispered I need you
Let me take you away and be your man.
Then I looked into his eyes and I saw it
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home. <start> Oh I was standing by the bedside
Where my fevered mother lay
When she called me close beside her
And I thought I heard her say
I've just seen the rock of ages
Jacob's ladder hanging down
I've just crossed the river of Jordan
Now my son I'm homeward bound
Oh as we gathered by her bedside
Tears begin to fill our eyes
Then she called me close beside her
And whispered softly her goodbyes
Pine trees blowing cross the mountain
Where forever she will lay
There she'll rest beside the fountain
There she'll sleep beneath the clay <start> Well lately you've been showin' all the signs
Of a woman with someone else on her mind
It's not your fault
Some nights I've left you alone
And if you're thinkin' you want a stranger
There's one comin' home
Chorus
If you're thinkin' you want a stranger
I'll soon be there
You're gonna see a change in me
This time I swear
No more late nights
Comin' in at daylight
And no more doin' you wrong
And if you're thinking you want a stranger
There's one comin' home
Bought you a silk gown and perfume today
Picked up some roses
And champagne on the way
Oh I called to ask you
To put some soft music on
'Cause if you're thinkin' you want a stranger
There's one comin' home
Chorus <start> Nice to meet you what's your name where ya from
Southern Ohio but your were born in Kentucky huh
What you doin in Tennessee Ahh yeah that's cool same with me.
Nashville can pull you in like that
It'll make you feel lucky I've heard people say that
When ya get that feelin the feeling's never wrong
By the look in your eyes I'd say that something's going on
Well tell me something I don't know
And kiss me hello
We been dancing dancing round it all night
Got a feeling feeling that we just might
Make a little magic in the moonlight
So come on with it......lets get on with it
We could waste a lot of sweet time
Waiting too long for the right time
I ain't looking for a goodnight kiss oh no
I just want you to kiss me hello
You like this song I like it too
I ain't much of a dancer but I sure would dance with you
The band's gonna play a couple more tunes we could
Hit the floor you could show me some moves
And there's a lot more that I'd like to know so baby lets go
And kiss me hello
We been dancing round it all night
Got a feeling feeling that we just might
Make a little magic in the moonlight
So come on with it......lets get on with it
We could waste a lot of sweet time
Waiting too long for the right time
I ain't looking for a goodnight kiss oh no
I just want you to kiss me hello
I've been dying to know what's behind that smile cause I can't get enough
Of that feelin that feeling that's telling me we gotta get to the good stuff
We been dancing dancing round it all night
Got a feeling feeling that we just might
Make a little magic in the moonlight
So come on with it......
And kiss me hello
We could waste a lot of sweet time
Waiting too long for the right time
I ain't looking for a goodnight kiss oh no
I just want you to kiss me hello <start> I was born one mornin'
The rain apourin' down
Heard my mammy say to my pappy
Let's call him John Henry Brown.
CHORUS
Walk on boy walk on down the road
Ain't nobody in this whole wide world
Agonna help you carry your load.
I left my mammy and pappy
Just about the age of ten
Lord I got me a job aworkin' on the levee
Totin' water for the hard workin' men.
CHORUS
Walk on boy walk on down the road
Ain't nobody in this whole wide world
Agonna help you carry your load.
One day my pappy told me
Some advice I wanna give to you 
Son find a good woman be good to her
An' she's gonna be good to you.
CHORUS
Walk on boy walk on down the road
There ain't nobody in this whole wide world
Agonna help you carry your load.
If anyone should ever ask you
Just who is that fella Brown
You can tell him I'm the boy
Who left his hammer smokin'
Where he beat that steam drill down.
CHORUS
Walk on boy walk on down the road
There ain't nobody in this whole wide world
Agonna help you carry your load.
Walk on boy walk on boy
Walk on boy. <start> You call me up at five to five and you ask me if I'll drop by
That you need me tonight you're all alone
Like the fool I am and the fool I'll be I drove there anxiously
But when I got there you were not alone
Chorus
When will I ever learn that you'll never care about me
You only build me up to bring me down again
When will I ever learn that you'll use me and abuse me
Oh tell me when will I ever learn
When will I learn when will I get wise you never apologize
I swear that this time I'm through with you
Like the fool I am and the fool I'll be the next time you need me
Once again I'll give in to you
Chorus <start> Would you please play
A real country song
Where's your conscience
What's the problem
Speak up and say what's wrong
Play Loretta
Or some Conway
Some Haggard and George Jones
Mr. DJ
Could you please play
A real country song
I miss that station I grew up on
W.S.M.
When it was real and country to the bone
And heartfelt stories in every song
Now don't rock it if you could swing it
Let Bob Wills take me home
Hey Mr. DJ
Could you please play
A real country song
Now in recent years y'all things sure have changed.
So quick we've barely even noticed. But pretty soon there's gonna be
No country legends walking here among us. Just like the drivein picture
Shows and the Mom and Pop stores.
Soon they're all gonna be gone
Just like the DJ
When he plays
A real country song
I miss that station I grew up on
K.I.K.K.
When it was real and country to the bone
And heartfelt stories in every song
I might like it if you could swing it
Let Bob Wills take me home
Hey Mr. DJ
Could you please play
A real country song
Now I don't rock it
If you could swing it
Let Bob Wills take me home
Hey Mr. DJ
Can't you please play
A real country song <start> Oh the river of death lies just before me
Can I find a place that I can cross
Or will I be in sin forever
Oh Lord don't let my soul be lost
Oh I wanna walk with Christ my savior
For he's the one that'll guide me on
All through my life I've been a sinner
Now I'm right with God so I'm travelling home
Oh I can hear my savior calling
To me his voice sounds sweet and low
For me I hear my loved ones cheering
Oh praise the Lord I'm ready to go
My life down here will soon be over
And this old world holds nothing for me
He saved my soul and He made me happy
That beautiful land I'm going to see <start> The crops are all in and the peaches are rotting
The oranges are piled in their creosote dumps
You're flying them back to the Mexican border
To pay all their money to wade back again
Goodbye to my Juan goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis amigos Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be deportee
Some of us are illegal and some of us are not wanted
Our work contract's out and we have to move on
But it's  miles to that mexican border
They chase us like outlaws like rustlers like thieves
Goodbye to my Juan goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis amigos Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be deportee
My father's own father waded that river
They took all the money he made in his life
My brothers and sister come work the fruit trees
They rode the truck til' they took down and died
The airplane caught fire over Los Gatos canyon
A fireball of lightning that shook all our hills
Who are these dear friends all scattered like dry leaves
The radio said they were just deportees
Goodbye to my Juan goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis amigos Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be deportee
No all they will call you will be deportee
All they will call you will be deportee <start> 
When I was a child I recall and old man everybody loved old Zeke
He was all alone his family was gone one day he said to me
I'm just sittin' here thinkin' about Jesus rockin' as my old chair creaks
Some glad day I'll fly away when Jesus comes calling for me
It might be today it might be tomorrow maybe one day next week
I'll soon be done with trouble and sorrow when He comes calling for me
When Jesus comes calling for me
When I die don't grieve and cry
Lordy don't feel sorry for me
Oh what a day what a mighty fine day
When Jesus comes calling for me
When He comes calling for me
I might be in the graveyard walking talking to my family
Or I might be plowing in the field down yonder just old Muley and me
Wherever I am whatever I'm a doing some sweet day I'll see
And band of angels in a cloud of glory when Jesus comes calling for me
When He comes calling for me
When I die just close my eyes
And lay me 'neath the willow tree
Oh what a day what a mighty fine day
When Jesus comes calling for me
When Jesus comes calling for me
I'm just sittin' here watchin' for Jesus rockin' as my old chair creaks
Some sweet day I'll fly away when Jesus comes calling for me
When He comes calling for me <start> Now
Don't just walk away
Pretending everything's okay and you don't care about me
And I
Know it's just no use
When all your lies become your truths and I don't care
Yeah yeah yeah
Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy now ooh ooh ooh
Would you tell it to my face
Or have I been erased are you happy now Ooh ooh ooh
Are you happy now
You took all there was to take
And left me with an empty plate and you don't care about it
Yeah
And I
Am giving up this game
And leaving you with all the blame 'cause I don't care
Yeah yeah yeah
Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy now Ooh ooh ooh
Would you tell it to my face
Or have I been erased are you happy now ooh ooh ooh
Are you happy now

You can't run away from yourself
Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy now yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Come on tell it to my face
Or have I been erased are you happy now Yeayea yeah
Yeah hoho yeayea hoho
Could you look me in the eye

RECORDED BY FREDDIE HART

I left you for the last time twenty times ago
Told everything except my mem'ry how can let you go
But you're just like a magnet and I'm a piece of tin
Oh I woke up this morning loving you again
Loving you again is just like begging to be hurt
Asking to be walked on but confessing I'm just dirt
But every time you kick me out I find my way back in
Helplessly but willingly loving you again
Yes loving you again is just like begging...
Helplessly but willingly loving you again
Helplessly but willingly loving you again <start>  Both 
Sunday Sunday Sunday morning a new week starts and the old one ends
On Sunday Sunday Sunday morning
Start the day out right with your family and your friends
 Nat 
Now I recall my younger years when I was just a pup
I could tell what day it was the moment I got up
On every Sunday morning and always without fail
My mom would have my Sunday suit out hanging on the nail
 Both 
On Sunday Sunday Sunday morning...
 Connie 
Now mom and dad and sis and I put on our Sunday clothes
And hand in hand we'd all walk down that long and dusty road
Then order book and up the hill through the mountain side
And all our friends and neighbors they were marching in a line
 Both 
On Sunday Sunday Sunday morning...
Now Pastor Brown was waiting there to teach us Sunday school
We'd open up the good book and we'd learn the golden rule
And fore we'd even know it'd wash away our sins
Oh Lord it's grand to see how warm our Sunday morn begins
On Sunday Sunday Sunday morning...
Start the day out right with your family and your friends <start> If they shoot me down to shut me down
Who will take my place
If they bring an army into this town
Who will take my place
If they rule this land and silence me
When I'm laid out with injury
When my words won't matter anymore
Who will take my place
Revolution you are not my hope
Who will take my place
There are flowers painted on these stones
Who will take my place
When the silence of oppression dies
Overheard beyond the battle cries
Are the words of final compromise.
Who will take my place
When the dogs of war are on the land
Who will take my place
When you forfeit life to take a stand
Who will take my place
When the dreamers fear the simplest thoughts
When the bloodshed takes all that you've got
When this world's an empty creaking floor
Who will take my place
If they rule this land and silence me
When I'm laid out with injury
When my words won't matter anymore
Who will take my place
Who will take my place <start> Well I make it alright 
From Monday morning till Friday night but oh those lonely weekends
Since you left me 
I'm as lonely as can be oh those lonely weekends
Said you'd be good to me said our love would never die
Said you'd be good to me but baby you didn't even try
Well I make it alright 
From Monday morning till Friday night but oh those lonely weekends
 guitar  steel 
Said you'd be good to me...
Oh those lonely weekends oh those lonely weekends <start> Everybody's gone away
Said they're movin' to L.A.
There's not a soul I know around
Everybody's leavin' town
Some caught a freight some caught a plane
Find the sunshine leave the rain
They said this town will waste your time
Guess they're right  it's wasting mine
Chorus
Some gotta win some gotta lose
Good Time Charlie's got the blues
Good Time Charlie's got the blues
why'know my heart keeps tellin' me
You're not a kid at 
why'play around why'lose your wife
why'play too long you lose your life
Got my pills t'ease the pain
Can't find a thing to stop the rain
I'd love t'try and settle down
But everybody's leavin' town
Chorus <start> Now we go our separate ways Mr. and Mrs. Used To Be
For oh so long I've loved you I know that you loved me
But time moved on and we grew far apart
It's not the way I wanted but the judge has set you free
Although you're still the first one in my heart
I just don't understand it how people such as we
Could know the love that we have known
But somehow disagree
I hope that you'll be happy the same dear
You from me now we go our separate ways
Mr. and Mrs. Used To Be
At first it was like heaven on earth for you and me
But heaven's sure has changed a lot since then
I can't put all the blame on you for some belongs to me
But started out at heaven reached an end <start> Midnight stoplight happens every time
Pretty girl in a car
No resemblance whatsover
I wonder how you are
Constant question poundin' in my brain
Is anybody loving you these days
Lonesome pillow sun comes yellow
I reach across the bed
Should be hurried workin' worries
I lie there insted
With the thought that's drivin' me insane
Is anybody loving you these days
Chorus
Damn this small town every place that I go
I drive by your house I see his car and I know
He's there with you but when he kisses you
Think about the memories we made and tell me
Is anybody loving you these days
Second chances backward glances
Most people just say no
World just keeps turnin' heart keeps yearnin'
I keep holdin' the hope
One day you might answer with my name
Is anybody loving you these days <start> When I wake up every morning you're the first thing that I see
And like a new day that is dawning I feel the warmth come over me
I can face the world a courage I can make it through the day
Cause I know your love comes with me standin' by me all the way
Oh what a beautiful way to live just givin' you all the love can give
Oh what a wonderful thing to see that you don't want nobody but me
 guitar 
I don't know how I'm deservin' to be blessed with all these things
Like the sweet love you keep servin' and the happiness it brings
I don't worry bout tomorrow way I always used to do
Cause tomorrow I'll be sharin' for some yesterday with you
Oh what a beautiful way...
 fiddle 
Oh what a beautiful way... <start> 
Well I remember when I was just little
Mama used to cook on an old black kettle
On an old wood stove she'd had since she was wed
Well the oven door was sprung a little bit
So we propped it up with a forked stick
But that didn't matter cause Mama kept us fed
My mama and daddy must have loved each other
Cause I had eleven sisters and brothers
And the girls worked just as hard as the boys did
There was corn to hoe then we'd go hoe it
We might have been poor but we didn't know it
We'd heard that word but we didn't know what it meant
Oh we used to have such a good life
And the days that I knew then are the happiest I've known
And oh didn't we have such a good time
It's sad to think the old black kettle's gone
Well there was nothing that pleased us any better
Than when we got an occasional letter
From kin folks livin' up north in some big town
We'd think of all the games we'd play
And we just couldn't hardly wait
When our city cousins said they'ze a comin' down
Now Mama's done away with the old black kettle
She used to cook in when I was just little
And the door ain't sprung on her electric range
That little farm and home we had
It ain't there no more and that's too bad
Folks are doin' away with the simple things
And oh we used to have such a good life
And the days that I knew then are the happiest I've known
And oh didn't we have such a good time
It's sad to think the old black kettle's gone <start> I will miss you when you go much more than you'll ever know
But I'll have a memory to keep you near
In my heart you will remain but it just won't be the same
I will miss the million things that make you dear
Your lovely ways make you so sweet I prayed the angels fair will keep
You're happiness so you'll be blessed just as you deserve to be
And as you travel all your way just remember that each day
Someone thinks of you and hopes you're happy dear

And when it's shining from above it will sparkle down with love
In all its glory for the world to see

Your treasured chest will be the best cause it's filled with God's sunshine
I wonder why there are so few lovely people just like you
My but I will surely miss you when you go <start> I have wondered this world far and wide
I've been all around to the other side
But there's nothin' like comin' home
I want to sit on my front porch and drink my lemonade
Cut my grass after church every Sunday
And go out on Saturday night
Live the simple life
Wake up in the morning to these fields of gold
And take a long walk down a gravel road
Spend my days in the sweet sunshine
Rock in my swing and watch my garden grow
Know that I'll always have someone to hold
Oh III want to live the simple life
I want to take a blanket down to the creek
And let the water sing me to sleep
Let go of time
Live the simple life
Lately I've seen too many city lights
I want to go somewhere where I can see the stars at night
Spend my days in the sweet sunshine
Rock in my swing and watch my garden grow
Know that I'll always have someone to hold
Oh III want to live the simple life
Spend my days in the sweet sunshine
Rock in my swing and watch my garden grow
Know that I'll always have someone to hold
Oh III want to live the simple life <start> I've rode lots of horses and I've won a few shows
Ridin' broncs at the big old rodeos
But the dangdest contraption that I've ever seen
Is that bucket of bots called a bucking machine
The kids they were all lined up to give the thing a go
And when I first saw it Lord it looked pretty slow
It jumped and it kicked and then it turned back and twirled
Then I got to thinking I'll give it a whirl
So I pushed through the crowd and I talked to the man
Who had invented this here modified garbage can
I said I'm a twister and one of the best
I'm a wolf of the world boys I must confess
I'll bet you a hundred I said with a grin
I'll spur it so hard its sides cave in
And the bolts and the screws hold the dang thing together
Will fall down inside it there and short out its motor
Well the man he said Son I'll take that bet
And I won't turn it on till you think that you're set
So I got my riggin' and I cinched it on down
Then I said to old Sam Go ahead and turn it on
Well it rattled and it groaned then it started to move
I spurred it every jump and Lord it felt mighty smooth
The foam rubber was a flyin' right off of its old neck
And the tin underneath it was startin' to crack
I looked at the man and I started to say
I'll win me that hundred 'fore the end of the day
Then he grabbed the big ol' lever with a little sly grin
Jammed it up to high gear and locked it right on in
With a snatch and a jerk and a sharp stabbin' pain
I felt like a hobo tied to an old freight train
My head it went to poppin' and I saw all the stars
The Big Dipper the Milky Way and the planet they call Mars
The next thing I knew I was right there on the ground
Just about thirty feet away from that laughin' crowd
So I payed up my hundred and I limped on away
And the words the man said I still remember today
So you're a wolf of the world and a real tough twister
Well listen real close to some good advise mister
Keep a ridin' them old broncs if you're still feeling mean
But you'd better keep clear of Sam's bucking machine <start> In silver sandals she goes walking up those golden stairs
And though we miss her so we know she's happy to be there
She walks with us in memory we see her all the time
In silver sandals walking through our minds
So many times we let our thoughts turn back to yesterday
To a little girl that could only watch the children as they played
She walks with us in memories we see her all the time
In silver sandals walking through our minds
The grave in which she sleeps is cold but our thoughts of her are warm
And we cry as we both long to hold her in our arms
Each night in dreams we see her running to us smiling sweet
With silver sandals on her little feet
In silver sandals she goes walking...
She had asked for sandals from the time that she could talk
And it would break our hearts when she'd ask us why she couldn't walk
She'd say when I go to heaven can I change my crutches then
For a pair of silver sandals at the rainbow's end
In silver sandals she goes walking...
In silver sandals walkin' through our minds <start> Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone.
Let's pretend that we're together all alone.
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go.
Whisper to me tell me do you love me true
Or is he holding you the way I do
Tho' love is blind make up your mind I've got to know
Should I hang up or will you tell him he'll have to go
You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man
If you want me answer yes or no
Darling I will understand.
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone.
Let's pretend that we're together all alone.
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go. <start> Born the middle son
Of a farmer
And a small town
Southern man
Like his daddy's
Daddy before him
Brought up
Workin' on the land
Fell in love
With a small town woman
And they married up
And settled down
Natural way of life
If you're lucky
For a small town
Southern man
First there came
Four pretty daughters
For this small town
Southern man
Then a few years
Later came another
A boy he wasn't planned
Seven people
Living all together
In a house built
With his own hands
Little words with love
And understanding
From a small town
Southern man
And he bowed
His head to Jesus
And he stood
For Uncle Sam
And he only loved
One woman
He was always proud
Of what he had
He said
His greatest contribution
Is the ones
You leave behind
Raised on the ways
And gentle kindness
Of a small town
Southern man
Raised on the ways
And gentle kindness
Of a small town
Southern man
Callous hands
Told the story
For this small town
Southern man
He gave it all
To keep it all together
And keep his family
On his land
Like his daddy
Years wore out his body
Made it hard
Just to walk
And stand
You can break the back
But you can't break
The spirit
Of a small town
Southern man
And he bowed
His head to Jesus
And he stood
For Uncle Sam
And he only loved
One woman
He was always proud
Of what he had
He said
His greatest contribution
Is the ones
You leave behind
Raised on the ways
And gentle kindness
Of a small town
Southern man
Raised on the ways
And gentle kindness
Of a small town
Southern man
Finally death
Came callin'
For this small town
Southern man
He said it's alright
'Cause I see angels
And they got me
By the hand
Don't you cry
And don't you worry
I'm blessed
And I know I am
'Cause God
Has a place in heaven
For a small town
Southern man
And he bowed
His head to Jesus
And he stood
For Uncle Sam
And he only loved
One woman
He was always proud
Of what he had
He said
His greatest contribution
Is the ones
You leave behind
Raised on the ways
And gentle kindness
Of a small town
Southern man
Raised on the ways
And gentle kindness
Of a small town
Southern man <start> Once in my youth I stood on this mountain
And planted some pines in the sand
Every day I looked their way
But just couldn't understand
Why they never grew like I thought they should do
I just couldn't understand why
Now I've rambled around this wide world through
And today I just happened by
Tall pines tall pines
Reaching up for the clouds
Tall pines tall pines
I bet you wouldn't know me now
I'll never forget the morning I left
The hum of the bees in the hay
The farther I walk the harder they talk
How silent it seems here today
There's an old rail fence that we built inch by inch
Surrounding the old family graves
And there's one gravestone standing all alone
There waiting to join me in the shade
Tall pines tall pines
Reaching up for the clouds
Tall pines tall pines
I've come home to sleep beneath your boughs <start> Sweetheart it's been several days now since they found me on the street
But since then an old friend Lonely Five and he's got me back on my feet
This morning I'll just drink enough to knock me out by noon
Yes I was down for a little while but I'm finally over you
The sun outside is much too bright that's why I'm wearing these shades
And the reason I haven't shaved it's because the drugstore ran out of blades
So if you hear that I'm not making it don't believe it because it's not true
Yes I was down for a little while but I'm finally over you
Yes I was down for a little while but I'm finally over you <start> Will it be my Uncle Ronnie I barely knew him when he left
He was only nineteen when he crashed that red Corvette
Will it be my great grandmother with some cookies that she baked
Oh I wonder who's gonna greet me at the gate
Will it be my goodfriend Matthew who spent his life in a chair
Will he coming running to me the day I get up there
Or that bully back in high school I told my Mama that I hate
Oh I wonder who's gonna greet me at the gate
Will it be a choir of Angels with some heavenly refrain
Or Saint Peter like I've always heard with his big book of names
Will it be my old dog Bailey who died when I was eight
Oh I wonder who's gonna greet me at the gate
Instrumental Interlude
I pray it's not my wife my daughter or my son
Cause that would mean the good Lord took em before my time was done
Tonight they're all sound asleep as I lie here wide awake
And I wonder who's gonna greet me at the gate
We're brought into this world with God only knows how many years
We crawl we walk we run we dance
We cry a million tears
And in a flash our lives are over
And we're face to face with fate
Oh I wonder who's gonna greet me at the gate
Who's gonna greet me at the gate <start> Moonlight's kinda like a spotlight shining down on you tonight
Ready or down low playing one good 'n slow
Setting it up just right
I can hear loud and clear what your eyes are saying to mine
It's about to get real good
Come on baby get real close
Girl you know I want you real bad
Got me falling fast
Let's take it where it wants to go
It's about to get real hot
It's a real deal
Yeah you're kissing me sliding up next to me
The way your heartbeat feels
It's about to get real
Where this is going is where I'd been hoping
We'd end up at
And if you keep on touching me and telling me you love me
There's no turning back
It feels like it should I knew it would
We can't miss are you ready for this
It's about to get real good
Come on baby get real close
Girl you know I want you real bad
Got me falling fast
Let's take it where it wants to go
It's about to get real hot

It's about to get real
It's about to get real good
Come on baby get real close

I would love you constantly
Tranquil stormy what ever future lies be for me
I will love you constantly
This world is changing fast
Nothings made that's meant to last
But I will only change I am sure
In a way that means I love you more
Laughter sorrow all on the road we call tomorrow
I will love you constantly
What ever life may bring you here's a truth your heart can cling to
I will love you constantly
Forever is a thing with a strange uncertain ring
And nothings ever set in stone
But my hearts forever yours and yours alone <start> Riding down south in my old Jeep
Jenny is painting her toe nails pink
And I'm fishing in the cooler for something to drink
Cold Coca Cola
My rocking radio is riding the dash
I've got a blue boogie board sticking out of the back
And I think that sign we just blew past
Said Pensacola
Yeah I know what to do when it's ninetytwo
And only getting hotter
Just add water
Jump right in and catch a wave
Just add water
A little something to wash the worries away
With the sun and the shine and the tan and the lines
A good time man we got 'er
Made in the shade
Just add water
Got a beach towel laid out down on the beach
A couple cold Coronas and four bare feet
And off in the distance you can just see 'em big boats dance
There's some Buffet coming out of the coconut hut
I guess some of them boys are catching a buzz
And some Joe with a pickup truck stuck in the sand
And Jenny's got on that little teeny twopiece bikini I bought her
Just add water
Jump right in and catch a wave
Just add water
A little something to wash the worries away
With the sun and the shine and the tan and the lines
A good time man we got 'er
Made in the shade
Just add water <start> I'll never love another now that you've gone away
And left me here to grieve dear all alone
It seems I always lose my dear no matter how I try
I'll never love another until the day I die
I'll never love another now that you've proved untrue
Without your lovin' darling what am I to do
I spend my life for you dear now you've left me blue
I'll never love another if I can't have you
My castles now have tumbled that we have built for two
And all my dreams have vanished dear with you
I'll find no one to take your place so I'll now even try
I'll never love another until the day I die
I'll never love another
Now you don't know my heartaches that you caused me to bear
Or you would not have gone away from me
I'll have to live my life alone and think of days gone by
I'll never love another until the day I die
I'll never love another <start> We didn't care if people stared
We'd make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebody'd tell us to get a room
It's hard to believe that was me and you
Now we keep saying that we're OK
But I don't want to settle for good not great
I miss the way that it felt back then
I wanna feel that way again
Been so long that you'd forget
The way I used to kiss your neck
Remind me remind me
So on fire so in love
Way back when we couldn't get enough
Remind me remind me
Remember the airport dropping me off
We were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop
I felt bad cause you missed your flight
But that meant we had one more night
Do you remember how it used to be
We'd turn out the lights and didn't just sleep
Remind me baby remind me
Oh so on fire so in love
That look in your eyes that I miss so much
Remind me baby remind me
I wanna feel that way
Yeah I wanna hold you close
Oh if you still love me
Don't just assume I know
Oh baby remind me remind me
Do you remember the way it felt
You mean back when we couldn't control ourselves
Remind me yeah remind me
All those things that you used to do
That made me fall in love with you
Remind me oh baby remind me
Yeah you'd wake up in my old tshirt
All those mornings I was late for work
Remind me oh baby remind me yeah
Oh baby remind me baby remind me
Yeah you'd wake up in my old tshirt
Oh baby remind me <start> Last week he spent his whole paycheck on whiskey
I know on Friday night he'll do it all again
Oh he'll drink till he falls down then he'll order one more round
And then go home with that bottle in his hand
And the only thing I can hold on to is this bottle in my hand
I'll know I'll never have to share it with any other man
I'm so glad you introduced us and I'll do the best I can
To be faithful to this bottle in my hand
She told George that changing diapers can sure become a drag
And the clean a house and cooking for him is not her kind of bag
She said he needed someone who'd love and understand
Then she left him with that bottle in his hand
And the only thing I can count on now is this bottle in my hand
I'll know I'll never have to share it oh with any other man
And I'm so glad you introduced us oh I'll do the best I can
To be faithful to this bottle in my hand
Yes we'll be faithful to this bottle in our hand <start> Alright bro
We're gonna have a talk about this
I brought you in this club and you done stole my girl
And that ain't right
When we walked into the club I thought it was understood mmm hmm
It was my turn tonight and it was your job to make me look good
Then I pointed out that sweet little beauty in black yes I did
I sent you over with a couple of drinks and you never came back
Chorus
You were supposed to be my wingman
Wasn't that your game plan
You take the grenade and I'll take the fox
Supposed to talk me up bro
No matter what so
Don't go tellin' me you must've forgot
You waltzed her off the dance floor
Right out the back door
Leaving me to go it alone
You're supposed to be my wingman
But the only thing that it should've been me
That's taking her home
Shortly after you left I was cussing your name hell I was
When her ugly girlfriend comes over starts working her game mmm
And I couldn't scare her off no matter what I'd said nah no
I was thinkin' I'm the one that should be kissing on that cutie instead
Chorus
You were supposed to be my wingman
Wasn't that your game plan
You take the grenade and I'll take the fox
Supposed to talk me up bro
No matter what so
Don't go tellin' me you must've forgot
You waltzed her off the dance floor
Right out the back door
Leaving me to go it alone
You're supposed to be my wingman
But the only thing that it should've been me
That's taking her home
Whoa
They say all is fair in love and war
And all in time I'm gonna settle that score
It ain't win or lose it's how you play the game
If I was in your shoes I might've done it just the same
Chorus
You were supposed to be my wingman
Wasn't that your game plan
You take the grenade and I'll take the fox
Supposed to talk me up bro
No matter what so
Don't go tellin' me you must've forgot
You waltzed her off the dance floor
Right out the back door
Leaving me to go it alone
You're supposed to be my wingman
But the only thing that it should've been me
That's taking her home
You waltzed her off the dance floor
Right out the back door
Leaving me to go it alone
You're supposed to be my wingman
But the only thing man it should've been me
That's taking her home
Is taking her home ohh
You were supposed to be my wingman mmm mmm <start> When the rodeo was over we're all go to the room.
We're drink some beer relax awhile and sing some cowboy tunes.
That old guitar we passed around it was battered scratched and
Broke.
But lord it sounded mighty fine when john ed sang cowpoke
Ben he'd think of some old tune and he'd really wail away.
Dunder'd play the spoons and sing until the break of day.
Clyde he'd tell a poem or two and old rich he'd crack a joke.
But damn it nearly make you cry when john ed sang cowpoke
Someday this road I travel lord I will leave behind.
But memories of the things I've seen will never leave my mind.
On a quiet summer's evening when the sun is sinking low
I'll think again of days gone by when john ed sang cowpoke. <start> He's not lookin' for your kind of love
I got a hand in his heart like a fist in a glove
You say you're strong
Well tough you better be
When he's lookin' for a fight he
Always comes back to me
Chorus
'Cause one good lover deserves another
I'm one good lover one good lover
He's just lookin' for a friendly smile
He got a look in his eye like
A Prisoner with a file
He don't love you he don't even know your name
It takes two to tango
Three to lose the game
Chorus
Try it one more time with feeling
But you can't hurt him like I can
Like I can
Like I can
One good lover deserves another
He's not lookin' for your kind of love
He likes a take and a give likes a pull and a shove
You're experienced advice is what you need
Listen closely I've got two words for you for free
Chorus <start> Wild wind take me home
To the mists of down below
I'll be flying come September day
With no borders in my way
You'll find me home until the May sun burns
The heavy mists of down below
Refrain
I see the rivers flooding strong
And people wishing they belonged
Free for anywhere they want to go
When they pray they can look to the sky
And they'd see me as I pass by
Heading to the mists of down below
Without fields ripe from rain
There is no way to feed my pain
Until I fly to mists of down below
But down below is not my fate
There is no land from where I came
Not even mists of old Mexico
Refrain <start> I've been a feelin' kinda funny oh and everyday is sunny
All the bees are makin' honey oh the lovin' season is on
Got all the ambition got a sweet deposition
Baby I've been wishin' you will gonna catch me before the lovin' season is gone
Well I've got nothing but time to try to win your love
Oh baby you're on my mind and you're the only thing I've been thinking of
Well I'm taking my stand I try as hard as I can
And prove that I'm the right man when lovin' season is near
Well baby you're so pleasin' all I need is squeezin'
Maybe that's the reason I'm a runnin' slow because the lovin' season is here
Well I've got nothing but time to try to win your love
Oh baby you're on my mind and you're the only thing I've been thinking of
Well I'm gonna bet'cha oh I'm gonna get'cha
Baby I'll just let'cha lovin' season is here lovin' season is here <start> It's now or never come hold me tight kiss me my darling be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late it's now or never my love won't wait
When I first saw you with your smile so tender
My heart was captured my soul surrendered
I've spent the lifetime waiting for the right time
Now that you're near the time is here at last
It's now or never come hold me tight...
Just like a willow we would cry an ocean if we lost true love and sweet devotion
Your lips excite me let your arms invite me
For who knows when we'll meet again this way
It's now or never come hold me tight...
It's now or never my love won't wait <start> Candle Lights Snow white winter is clear as crystal
Stands like a dream thats frozen forever in time
Log fire warms me as the sun retires for another day
Wrap me up in a dream of you and throw me away
Dark eyed even tide
Mellow mantel is fallen
And on the silence the nightingale sings his song
Stars blink from a sky of Indian ink
While I kneel an pray
Wrap me up in a dream of you
Throw me away
I'll sit and listen as the clock ticks by
Holding you inside my mind
I can't believe that's times have forgotten how to fly
Since you left my worlds behind
Silver haired
Mother stares into the hills of her memory
Old smiles soften by years of Living and Love
She knows where the river of my longing flows
When she hears me say
Wrap me up in a dream of you
Throw me away
She knows where the rivers of my longing flows
When she hears me say
Wrap me up in a dream of you
Throw me away
Wrap me up in a dream of you
And throw me away
Throw me away  <start> I never fly they say you don't know what you're missing
Your dreams just come alive but I forget to try
So I I never fly
Warm in my bed the places I imagine
Could live only in your head
So sweet that I could cry
But I never fly
When I was just a little boy before I'd fall asleep
My mind would wander way beyond the stars
A neverending universe too big for thoughts to keep
Surrounds me like an Angel in the sky
I love to dream flowing just like heaven
On a gently flowing stream
I'll watch the world go by but I I never fly <start> Ol' Reuben made a train and he put it on a track
He ran it to the Lord knows where
Oh me oh my ran it to the Lord knows where
Shoulda been in town when Reuben's train went down
You could hear that whistle blow a hundred miles
Oh me oh my you could hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
Last night I lay in jail had no money to go my bail
Lord how it sleeted and it snowed
Oh me oh my Lord how it sleeted and it snowed
I've been to the East I've been to the West
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
Oh me oh my I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
Oh the train that I ride is a hundred coaches long
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
Oh me oh my you can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
I got myself a blade laid Reuben in the shade
I'm startin' me a graveyard of my own
Oh me oh lordy my startin' me a graveyard of my own
Ol' Reuben made a train and he put it on a track
He ran it to the Lord knows where
Oh me oh my ran it to the Lord knows where <start> Wish that I was on old Rocky Top down in the Tennessee hills
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top ain't no telephone bills
Once I had a man on Rocky Top half bear the other half cat
Wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop and I still dream about that
Oh Rocky Top you'll always be home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top Rocky Top Tennessee Rocky Top Tennessee
Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top lookin' for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top reckon they never will
Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top dirt's too rocky by far
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top get their corn from a jar
Oh Rocky Top you'll always be home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top Rocky Top Tennessee Rocky Top Tennessee
Here we go now play yeah
And here comes Charlie McCoy yeah
I've had years of trapped up city life trapped like a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a pity life can't get simple again
Oh Rocky Top you'll always be home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top Rocky Top Tennessee Rocky Top Tennessee
Rocky Top Tennessee <start> Just a mile west of the water tank
On a cold November day
In a cold and lonesome box car
A dyin hobo lay
His pal sat there before him
With a low and drooping head
Listening to the last words
His dying buddy said
Goodbye old pardner hobo
I hate to say goodbye
But I hear my train a comin
 I know shes getting nigh
Gonna tell that old conductor
Just when I'm gonna stop
Where the little stream of water
Comes tumblin down the rock
We rode the rocks together
We rambled all around
In every kind of weather
We slept out on the ground
Oh pardner don't you miss that train
That always makes a stop
Where the little stream of water
Comes tumblin down the rock
Would you tell my girl from Danville
That she need not worry a tall
I'm a goin to that country
Where I won't have to work at all
No I wll not have to work there
Or never change my socks
Where the little stream of water
Comes tumblin down the rocks
I'm a goin to that better place
Where everything is right
Where handouts grow on bushes
And they sleep out every night
I won't have to wash my overhauls
Or never change my socks
Where the little stream of water
Comes tumblin down the rocks <start> Miracles appear in the strangest of places
Fancy me finding you here
The last time I saw you was just out of Houston
Let me sit down and buy you a beer
Your presence is welcome with me and my friend here
'Cause this is a hangout of mine
We come here quite often to listen to music
And to taste yesterday's wine
Yesterday's wine yesterday's wine
Agin' with time like yesterday's wine
Yesterday's wine yesterday's wine
We're agin' with time like yesterday's wine
You give the appearance of one widely traveled
But lord I'll bet you've seen things in your time
Come sit down here with us and tell us your story
If it's true you like yesterday's wine
Yesterday's wine yesterday's wine
We're agin' with time like yesterday's wine
Yesterday's wine yesterday's wine
We're agin' with time like yesterday's wine <start> You were mine for just awhile
Now you're putting on the style
And you never once looked back
At your home across the track
You're the gossip of the town
But my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it on the ground
Pick me up on your way down
Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When the glamor starts to boar you
Come on back where you belong
You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
When they take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down
Well they've changed your attitude
Made you haughty and so rude
But underneath you're still the same
Hey I know they're to blame
If you find these thing are true
I'll be waiting here for you
As you tumble to the ground
Pick me up on your way down
Yeah pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When the glamor starts to boar you
Come on back where you belong
You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
When they take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down <start> May the fruit of my toil be yours love
May the food from my soil be yours love
And from this moment on may a love that is strong
And lives on and on be yours love
May the sons that I raise be yours love
May the comforts I praise be yours love
If I ever get weak may the love words I speak
And the arms that I seek be yours love
May the Lord's shining grace be yours love
May the happiest face be yours love
May the last fingertips that touch these two lips
As life from me slips be yours love <start> Sometimes I try to count the ways and reasons that I love you
But I can't ever seem to count that far
I love you in a million ways and for a million reasons
More than this I love you as you are
More than this I love you as you are
You are my inspiration you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want that's what you are
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are
You are my thoughts when I'm awake my dreams when I'm asleep
You are the reason for my smile you are the words I speak
Every role I play in life you play the leading part
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are
You are my inspiration you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want that's what you are
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are <start> You never listen to a word I say

I give you reasons why you're gonna get broken
But it's as if my words never were spoken
You're the one in charge heart
Well I've got no choice but to follow you
That's a fact I'd better face it
'Cause I can't beat how you make me feel
Oh you know you're so persuasive

You can be so hard heart
Oh I say stop and you say go it drives me crazy
We agree on anything it drives me crazy
But that's the way you are heart
Well I've got no choice but to follow you
That's a fact I'd better face it
'Cause I can't beat how you make me feel
Oh you know you're so persuasive
Sometimes I wish that you'd just leave me alone
But there's some things I can't do on my own
So I'll take my chance finish what you start heart

To say I like it. <start> Here the labor is so hard and the workers they are tired
And our weary hearts're yearning for a rest
And I find we're getting anxious to be in that happy home
Where we'll receive such peace and happiness
But wait a little longer please Jesus there are so many wandering out in sin
Just a little longer please Jesus a few more days to get our loved ones in
Family scattered here and there and thought Lord we love them dear
Maybe we can help them find a way
But if waiting is the cost dear ol' Lord then I'll be lost
And that's the only reason why we say
Wait a little longer please Jesus
A few more days to get our loved ones in <start> I heard from a friend of a friend of a friend that
You finally got rid of that girlfriend
You finally came out of that love coma boy
I heard Mary Jane at the powderpuff beauty shop
Sayin' that blond in her tube top
She left our Jimmy for a boy in Illinois
Someone give me an amen
Someone give me an amen.
Can I get a thank God Hallelujah
You finally saw what she was doing to ya
Your mama called it she was right
Glad to see you saw the light.
Whole town yeah we hooped and hollered.
She drove away nobody stopped her
Na na na na na I'll say it again
Someone give me an amen.
Yeah right like I really coulda said something
You wouldn't heard it if the train was coming
You had your head so high in the clouds
Oh I I had a really good reason
For hiding my feelings but now I can finally spit it out
Someone give me an amen.
Someone give me an amen.
Can I get a thank God Hallelujah
You finally saw what she was doing to ya
Your mama called it she was right
Glad to see you saw the light.
Whole town yeah we hooped and hollered.
She drove away nobody stopped her
Na na na na na I'll say it again
Someone give me an amen.
I'm standing right here in front of you
I think I love you too
Can I get a thank God Hallelujah
Baby do you believe it do you
Your mama called it she was right
Glad to see you saw the light.
Whole town yeah they hooped and hollered.
The preacher's son and the farmer's daughter.
Na na na na na I'll say it again
Someone give me an amen
Someone give me an amen
Na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na <start> Sometimes I want to throw my arms around you
And I tremble at the thought of giving in
Because I know how much it cost to love you and I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you revives the sorrow that wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow but I'm so afraid of losing you again
If heaven were to hear my heart's confession wanting you would be my greatest sin
But I'm glad that you're no longer my possession
Cause I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you
But I'm so afraid of losing you again <start> I see you here night after night
All by yourself in the blue neon light
A drink in your hand a tear on your face
A beautiful woman so out of place
I guess somebody told you goodbye
In a million years I couldnt unederstand why
Chorus
What kind of fool
Didn't want you
What kind of fool
Tore your heart in two
What kind of fool
Didn't do everything he could do
To hold on to you
What kind of fool
Well I ain't no saint and I ain't no king
I don't know it all but I do know one thing
Whoever it was that made you so blue
Never deserevd a woman like you
He should be down on his bended knees
Beggin' you to forgive him please
Chorus
One day he'll wake up
And realize the terrible truth
He'll see that he had it all
When he had you
Chorus Repeat X <start> I buried him down by the river
'cause that's where he liked to be
And every night when the moon is high
I go there and weep openly
He and I were married
By this river 'neath this willow tree
And with God and friends witnessing it
He pledged his life to me
To me he was Earth
And I rooted in his soil
I to he was Sky vast and free
Of the burdens from which he toiled
Then one night a terrible fight
Words spoken better left unsaid
With his wedding vows ringing in my ears
He gave his life to me
They say to love is to bury
Those demons from which we all hide
But tonight by this river 'neath this willow tree
Becoming one of Earth and Sky <start> 
Come come come come.
Come to the church in the Wildwood
Oh come to the church in the vale
No spot is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the vale.
There's a church in the valley by the Wildwood
No lovelier spot in the dale
No place is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the vale.
So sweet on a clear Sabbath morning
To list to the clear ringing bell
Its tones so sweetly are calling
Oh come to the church in the vale.
Come come come come.
Come to the church in the Wildwood
Oh come to the church in the vale
No spot is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the vale...

 <start> 
We're all together once again
For the first time in I don't know when
We were so close once upon a time
There were five of us kids at home
Two girls three boys and Dad and Mom
But that was in the better part
Of life we left behind
Remember that old swimming hole
Where we would swim so long ago
And all them possum grapes and muskedines
And do you recall the time
We all got drunk on homemade wine
That was in the better part
Of life we left behind
Life was simple for us then
If only it could be again
How I wish we could go back in time
But time moves on and nothin' lasts
Except the memories from the past
Memories from the better part
Of life we left behind
Remember how we talked as kids
Of what we'd be when we got big
And all the dreams that we held in our minds
I wanted to be a singin' star
And you all said that I'd go far
But that was in the better part
Of life we left behind
Remember all the fun we had
Back when they say times were bad
And life was good to us and things were fine
We had fun and we had love
And a mom and dad to care for us
But that was is the better part
Of life we left behind
Life was simple for us then
If only it could be again
How I wish we could go back in time
But time moves on and nothin' lasts
Except the memories from the past
Memories from the better part
Of life we left behind
Sweet memories from the better part
Of life we left behind <start> The moon is full and my arms are empty
All night long I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that you would leave
Would be a cold day in July
Your bags are packed not a word is spoken
I guess we said everything with goodbye
Time moves so slow and promises get broken
On this cold day in July
Sun's comin' up comin' up down on Main Street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands here I am
Standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away
You said that we were gonna last forever
You said our love would never die
It looks like spring and
It feels like sunny weather
But it's a cold day in July
Sun's comin' up comin' up down on Main Street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands here I am
Standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away
The moon is full my arms are empty
All night long how I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that you would leave me
Would be a cold day in July
Here comes that cold day in July <start> There she was
Laughin' talkin' window shoppin' with a new guy
And I'd heard about him
I heard she found him right around when we said goodbye
And I came real close and almost lost my temper
But I bit my tongue kept my cool 'cause I remembered
Chorus
I don't care
She don't matter
I don't love her anymore he can have her
I don't know why it slips my mind
I tell myself all the time
Guess I forgot again for a second there
That I don't care
Almost ten
I should've known his car would still be parked in her drive
Almost pulled in
Knocked on her door and gave her a piece of my mind
Oh but I just kept on driving back to my place
Wonderin' why I went so far out of my way when...
Chorus
When I got home the light was blinkin' on that old machine
She said My brother's been in town but he just left
And I miss you Give me a ring
I still care
She's all that matters
I still love her just like always gotta have her
I never got her off my mind been hopin' she would call sometime
I know it's late to be drivin' over there but I don't care
I don't care <start> Once you were together now you're far apart
One who swore to love you has gone and broke your heart
But don't cry on your pillow don't let it get you down
Put on that party dress go out and paint the town
Baby swing baby swing
It's easy as the lullaby your momma used to sing
Once you feel that rhythm you won't worry about a thing
Just swing swing baby swing
There's a juke joint down the highway past the city limit sign
Check your troubles at the door go on and have a good time
The band can play the boogie beat so wear your dancing shoes
Let that old piano man pound away your blues
Baby swing baby swing
It's easy as the lullaby your momma used to sing
Once you feel that rhythm you won't worry about a thing
Just swing swing baby swing <start> In that resurrection morning
When the trumpet of God shall sound
We shall rise we shall rise

Then the saints will come rejoicing and
No tears will eer be found
We shall rise we shall rise

We shall rise we shall rise

We shall rise in that resurrection morning

When these prison bars are broken
We shall rise we shall rise

In that resurrection morning
When the shades of life has fled
We shall rise we shall rise

In the day of glory dawning when the sea
Gives up his dead
We shall rise we shall rise

I shall see my blessed savior
Who so freely died for me
We shall rise we shall rise

And our fathers and our mothers and our
Loved ones we shall see
We shall rise we shall rise
 <start> Now tell me where could I go but to the Lord
Living below in this old sinful world hardly a comfort can afford
Striving alone to face temptation sore where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go oh where could I go seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end  where could I go but to the Lord
Life here is grand with friends I love so dear comfort I get from God's own word
Yet when I face the chilling hand of death where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go...
Where could I go... <start> Caught a . bullet in my thight one night
tryin' to break up a barroom fight
Went home dug it out with my old Case knife
Broke down in a blizzard on the great divide
Walked twenty miles till I caught a ride
The Trooper said Boy it's a wonder you're still alive

I've rode hard luck I been bruised and bucked
I been hittin' the ground then I turn it around
an gettin' back up
Now they're layin' em off down in Kankakee
And there's boards on the windows up and down the streets
an they're sayin' that it's gonna get darker before the dawn
But you can bet your ass I'll keep the lights on
Keep my babies fed an' throw my dog a bone
Cuz I'm a bring it on get her done don't run s.o.b.
Times are tough
But they ain't got nothin' on me
I got a three legged dog I call Jake
Got the won't back down scars on his face
He tussled with a bear  came in second place
He come's back home every now and then
with some brand to scars and I have to grin
Ya know I'm proud to call ole Jake my friend
Cuz he's known hard luck
He's been bruised and bucked
He been hittin' the ground and he's turnin' around
an gettin' back up
Now they're layin' em off down in Kankakee
And theres boards on the windows
up and down the streets
An they're sayin' that it's gonna get darker before the dawn
But you can bet your ass I'll keeo the lights on
Keep my babies fed an throw my dog a bone
Times are tough but they ain't got nothin' on me
Yeah times are tough but they ain't got nothin' on me <start> you didn't know I wasn't free when you fell in love with me... <start> Walkin' down this lonely stretch of beach
She and I walked down a thousand times
I just can't force myself to give her up
Like all the things she left behind
Gone are the days when I'd wake up
With her warm body next to mine
It gets cold here in the wintertime
And my mind drifts away
To that house across the bay.
A long talk and a glass of wine
And we'd love the night away
But that was yesterday
In that house across the bay.
Her laughter was contagious
Her walk her talk her smile lit up every room.
They say things happen for a reason
But I can't find one good reason
Why she's gone so soon.
Life just seems to hang
On every thought and everything
We used to be.
It gets cold here in the wintertime
And my mind drifts away
To that house across the bay.
A long talk and a glass of wine
And we'd love the night away
But that was yesterday
In that house across the bay. <start> This is a song that nobody knows
I couldn't begin to describe how it goes
But it makes me cry or laugh right out loud
It's a song that I sing when there's no one around
This is the man that nobody sees
He wears my old clothes and he looks just like me
Just one of the boys who gets lost in the crowd
He's the man that I am when there's no one around
It's four in the morning
I'm lyin' in bed
A tape of my failures
Playin' inside my head
It's heartaches and hard knocks
And things I don't know
I listen and I wonder
Where will it go
This is a glimpse of the child that's within
He's so immature but he's still my best friend
If he could learn how to fly he'd never touch down
He's the kid that I am when there's no one around
This is the dance I do every day
I let my feet go and get carried away
I let my soul lead and follow the sound
It's the dance that I do when there's no one around
It's four in the morning
I'm lyin' in bed
A tape of my failures
Playin' inside my head
It's heartaches and hard knocks
And things I don't know
I listen and I wonder
Where will it go
Thi is a song that nobody knows
I still can't begin to describe how it goes
But it makes me cry our laugh right out loud
It's a song that I sing when there's no one around
It's a song that I sing when there's no one around <start> For all the times I felt cheated I complained
You know how I love to complain
For all the wrongs I repeated though I was to blame
I still cursed that rain
I didn't have a prayer didn't have a clue
Then out of the blue
God gave me you to show me what's real
There's more to life with just how I feel
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes
And all that I live for though I didn't know why
Now I do 'cause God gave me you
For all the times I wore my self pity like a favorite shirt
All wrapped up in that hurt
For every glass I saw I saw half empty
Now it overflows like a river through my soul
From every doubt I had I'm finally free
And I truly believe
God gave me you to show me what's real
There's more to life than just how I feel
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes
And all that I live for though I didn't know why
Now I do 'cause God gave me you
In your arms I'm someone new
With ever tender kiss from you
Oh must confess
I've been blessed
God gave me you to show me what's real
There's more to life than just how I feel
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes
And all that I live for though I didn't know why 
Now I do  'cause God gave me you 
God gave me you <start> She's alone in the corner with her panties to her knees lookin in the mirror
she gives her tits a squeeze. Slides her finger thru the wetness rubbing
gently on her clit. Breathing heavy with each stroke now. She's not worried
bout me watchin its too late now to refuse nightly fever you can't shake
down masturbation blues.
He picks up the dirty picture with his dick hard in his hand with a stroke
you see hime moving with the music of the band against the wall you see him
jerking as the cum spills on the floor as he swells in the mirror he won't
do this anymore he's not worried bout me watchin it's too late now to refute
nightly fever you can't refuse masturbation blues.
 <start> Everybody talks about a new world in the morning
A new world in the morning so they say
I myself don't talk about a new world in the morning
A new world in the morning that's today
And I can feel a new tomorrow coming on
And I don't know why I have to make a song
Everybody talks a bout a new world in the morning
New world in the morning takes so long
I met a man who had a dream he had since he was twenty
I met that man when he was eightyone
He said too many folks just stand and wait up till the morning
Don't they know tomorrow never comes
And he would feel a new tomorrow coming on
And when he'd smile his eyes would twinkle up in fun
Everybody talks about a new world in the morning
New world in the morning never comes <start> It's not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me oh no
It's just the nearness of you
It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation oh no
It's just the nearness of you
When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true
I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you'll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night the nearness of you <start> Little man you're crying I know why you're blue
Someone took your kiddy car away
Better go to sleep now little man you've had a busy day
Johnny won your marbles tell you what we'll do
Dad'll get you new ones right away
Better go to sleep now little man you've had a busy day
You've been playing soldier the battle has been won
The enemy is out of sight
Come along there soldier put away your gun
The war is over for tonight
Time to stop your scheming time your day was through
Can't you hear the bugle softly say
Time you should be dreaming little man you've had a busy day
Little man you've had a busy day <start> They call me a playboy
While I'm making my rounds
Chasing the bright lights
Of every night spot in town
Though I never show son
My heart's breaking in two
They may call me a playboy
But I'm just lonesome for you
I once had a real love
That was when I had you
Now I'll never feel love
With anyone new
This false front I'm wearing
Is just to cover my blues
They may call me a playboy
But. I'm just lonesome for you
 Instrumental 
I once had a real love

TRADITIONAL
Smile from the inside out smile from the inside out
Black Drought makes you smile from the inside out <start> The windmills and the water tanks all stand on solid ground
The country mailman mutters as he motors into town
The sunlight came the sunlight went the stars came out to see
The way I laughed at the way I cried at the way you treated me
The ocean babe is watered down but these plains are high and dry
And though you've seen your share of dreams you've never seen me cry
The windshield and the radio play sadly through the night
A crazy blazin' fallin' star just passed me on the right
The tail lights down the highway fade low and out of sight
And that farmer's dog can only bark but this cold north wind can bite
The ocean babe is watered down but these plains are high and dry
And though you've seen your share of dreams you've never seen me cry <start> By David Allan Coe
Dedicated to Dr. Martin Scheid who saved my life when my appendix busted in Houston and to all the people who came to my last concerts of  and didn't complain that I was only able to sing from a wheel chair.
I SPENT A LIFETIME IN PRISON BELIEVING ID NEVER GET OVER THE FALL
BUSTED FOR FIRST DEGREE I WAS TO BLIND TO SEE WHO WAS TO BLAME FOR IT ALL
SOME SAID THE DEVIL BUT GOD ONLY KNOWS IF I PUT MY FUTURE IN HIM
OTHER FOLKS BET THAT ID NEVER GET ON MY FEET AGAIN
RUNNING AND JUMPING FREE AS A BIRD JUST LIKE A CHILD LEFT TO PLAY
FREEDOM WAS ONE MORE THING I TOOK FOR GRANTED UNTIL THEY TOOK IT AWAY
MARRIAGES BREAKUP AND SOME PEOPLE TAKE UP DRINKING TO MAKE THEM FORGET
BOTH OF THEM SWEARING NEITHER ONE CARING WISHING THAT THEY NEVER MET
TAKING THE CHILD AWAY WHO CARES WHAT CHILDREN SAY UNTIL THEY TURN INTO MEN
SOMEDAY YOU'LL SEE I'm GONNA BE ON MY FEET AGAIN <start> Till I became a wanted man
I never owned a gun
But now they hunt me like a mountain cat
And I'm always always always on the run
I killed poor Jed Bryant
In a bad Laredo fight
Killed him with my bare hands
For the girl I loved that night.
Jed's brother's out to get me
He's comin' with a gang
I'd rather shoot it out by God than let 'em see me hang
Bullet in my shoulder
Blood runnin' down my vest
Twenty in the posse
And they're never gonna let me rest.
Till I became a wanted man
I never owned a gun
But now they hunt me like a mountain cat
And I'm always always always on the run
Spangles on her red dress
Laughter in her voice
When he tried to put his hands on her
My heart left me no choice.
But was she really worth it
I guess I'll never know
She'll be drinkin' someone else's rye when I'm six feet below.
Bullet in my shoulder
Blood runnin' down my vest
Twenty in the posse
And they're never gonna let me rest.
Till I became a wanted man
I never owned a gun
But now they hunt me like a mountain cat
And I'm always always always on the run. <start> There are people who don't know me
Who must think I've got it made
From all outward appearances
I guess it looks that way
I've got good friends and family
They let me know they care
I got a job to keep me going
And a car to get me there
I'm holding my own
But I'd rather be holding you
I can make it alone
But not like I made it with you
Without you here
This house just ain't no home
How long can I go on holding my own
There's brand new show that's playing
At the movies down the street
I'll probably go there after work
Then stop somewhere to eat
I've got cable on my TV
And I'll leave her on all night
While I dose off to sleep
And dream that I'm alright
I'm holding my own
But I'd rather be holding you
I can make it alone
But not like I made it with you
Without you here
This house just ain't no home
How long can I go on holding my own <start> Some where up there beyond the blue
Surely by now somebody's missin' you
I found the angel they must be lookin' for
Heaven must be wondering where you are
When I look into your eye's
It's so plain to see
Nothin' here on earth describes what you mean to me
Out of this world when I hold you in my arms
Heaven must be wondering where you are
Lucky me to be the one to find
Someone like you this side of paradise
I know how lost I'd be without here sweetheart
Heaven must be wondering where you are
Some where up there beyond the blue
Surely by now somebody's missin' you
I found the angel they must be lookin' for
Heaven must be wondering where you are <start> Is it really me sittin' here crying
Well it shouldn't be It just can't be me my eyes're lying
Cause that's not you it just can't be you you wouldn't be cheating
It's someone else yes it's someone else whose darling's leaving
I can't believe my eyes you took me by surprise
How I wish I'd just stayed home I'd still be thinking you're all my own
This isn't me it just can't be me sittin' here crying
It's just a dream it's got to be a dream our love can't be dying
I just can't believe my eyes you sure took me by surprise
Oh how I wish I'd just stayed home I'd still be thinking you're all my own
Now this isn't me it just can't be me a sittin' here crying
Maybe it's just a dream oh it's got to be a dream our love can't be dying <start> If you have a love that's true one who never makes you blue
Let your things and love show through tell her so tell her so
Give her a kiss once in a while a tender touch a loving smile
If you're happy let her know tell her so tell her so
 steel 
Never let her heart grow cold she means more to you than gold
If you're proud she's yours to hold tell her so tell her so
So give her a kiss... <start> In the unemployment line in the unemployment line
I see a butcher and a baker a faker and a quaker and an old girl friend of mine
There's white collars blue collars and no collars too talking bout the bad new times
And we all get together every Wednesday afternoon in the unemployment line
Now who do you think was there today talking bout food and rent
There was a hard hat a fat cat a girl from the laundromat and one expresident
I raised my eyes and prayed to the Lord please save this world of mine
Then I turned around and I saw God standin' in the unemployment line
In the unemployment line in the unemployment line
Hey I'll see all of you in a week or two in the unemployment line <start> I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold
I'd rather rather have Him than riches untold
I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands
I'd rather be led by His nailpierced hands
Than to be a king of the vast domains
Than be held in sins dread sway
I'd rather have Jesus than anything
This world can afford today
I'd rather have Jesus than man's applause
See I'd rather be faithful to His dear cause
Oh I'd rather have my Jesus than all the worldwide fame
Yes I'd rather be true to His holy to His holy name

He works a nine to five
Bending steel and driving nails
By phone in a suit and tie
He fights traffic in his Mercedes
To put on his cowboy boots
Then he climbs on board his pickup truck
And barrels on out of the chute
Dallas days and Fort Worth nights
All day long he sets his sights
On ice cold beer and neon lights
From sky high beams
To bucking machines
He's a single man with a double life
Dallas days and Fort Worth nights
Yeah he's headed honkytonkin'
To a place they call Cowtown
He's gonna hit the floor hiphoppin'
Just spinnin' when the sun goes down
He'll buy a drink for a cowgirl
Hopin' to quench her thirst
One that'll take him to heaven
And bring him back down to earth
Dallas days and Fort Worth nights
All day long he sets his sights
On ice cold beer and neon lights
From sky high beams
To bucking machines
He's a single man with a double life
Dallas days and Fort Worth nights
Dallas days and Fort Worth nights
All day long he sets his sights
On ice cold beer and neon lights
From sky high beams
To bucking machines
He's a single man with a double life

All day long he sets his sights
On ice cold beer and neon lights

You've got your sexy way of talking
I let you get all under my skin
But now your welcome has worn awful thin
And so now it's time you go
Don't come back again
Cause your train don't stop here any more
I ain't your gasup reststop swinging door
You can't just walk in
Walk out like so many times before
I ain't your swinging door
You've got a girl in every cow town
You think I don't know how you cad around
I let your sweet talk in my guard down
Took me a while to figure you out
But I've got you
Figured all out now
And your train don't stop here any more
I ain't your gasup reststop swinging door
You can't just drop in
Drop out like so many times before
I ain't your swinging door
You'd best make up your mind
Cause if you go
You ain't coming back this time
Your train don't stop here any more
I ain't your quickstop lock up open twentyfour
You can't just drop in drop out
Treat me like your candy store
Cause your train don't stop here any more
I ain't your gasup reststop swinging door
You can't just walk in
Walk out like so many times before
I ain't your swinging door
I ain't your swinging door <start> Well I was sent to a place in North Carolina
To check up on a moonshine still
When I got there to my surprise
I could see a little light on the hill
Well the fire was a glowing and really I was knowing
I was really hot on the track
But in D.C. they said it couldn't be
Well I'll be the one to bring 'em back
'Cause I'm a revenooer man
Yeah I'm a revenooer man
I got a badge in my pocket and a gun on my hip
Them moonshiners better never make a slip
'Cause I'm a revenooer man
Yeah I'll get 'em if I can
Well the moon was shining bright and I looked down the river
I noticed on the side of the hill
I can see a red light that was glowing right bright
I knew it had to be a still
There were people down the road said it wasn't far
But I better know someone
'Cause when the moonshiners know I carry a star
I'll bet my bottom dollar I'll have 'em on the run
'Cause I'm a revenooer man
Yes I'm a revenooer man
I got a badge in my pocket and a gun on my hip
Them moonshiners better never make a slip
'Cause I'm a revenooer man
Yeah I'll get 'em if I can
Well when I got back the woods was a bare
They must've knew I was on my way
Well I heard the branches shatter and they started to scatter
I heard two or three of them say
It's the revenooer man
Yeah It's the revenooer man
He got a big  with loads to fill
Dragging and a shagging to another hill
It's the revenooer man
And he'll get us if he can <start> Like any man it's hard for me to admit it
All the dead end roads that I've been down
It took you for me to finally get it
You don't know you're lost until you're found
Like a river bends to find the ocean
Every wrong turn led me straight to you
You're the right one baby and I ain't letting go
Believe me I've been wrong enough to know
Too many times I have neglected
The sobering truth staring me in the face
I have denied and rejected
Your honest touch and and amazing grace
Like a river bends to find the ocean
Every wrong turn led me straight to you
You're the right one baby and I ain't letting go
Believe me I've been wrong enough to know <start> I left you this morning couldn't take it anymore
You laughed and you dared me till walk out the door
You said that I'd come back you knew what I'd do
And you know you were right I'm back here tonight begging to you
I won't disappoint you I'm begging to stay that's what you wanted to hear anyway
It must make you happy to make me so blue
What a pityful sight I must be tonight begging to you
You don't want my lovin' but you let me hang around
I guess just to walk on so you don't touch the ground
To you it don't matter what you cause me to do as long as you keep me begging to you <start> The Jimmy Buffer Song
David Allen Coe
Prelude
This song is for all the people that's been reviewing our records and say we sound a lot like Jimmy Buffet because we live in Key West and use Congo drums in our songs. For all those people that live in Key West and are under the misconception that Mr. Buffet live in Key West and we'd like to say there's a lot of things in Key West as a matter of fact there's
Chorus
There's sailboats and conk shells and palm trees galore
But Jimmy Buffet doesn't live in Key West anymore
Sister spare change has a bumper sticker on the door
Says Jimmy Buffet doesn't live here any more
Verse 
Hey smugglers need those Buffet songs snitching on the sly
Bringing heat where it's already to damn hot to die
Son of a son of bitch what's all that bullshit for
Jimmy Buffet doesn't' live in Key West anymore
Verse 
Sailing to the Caribbean Jimmy might well be
Pictures up in Rollin' Stone for all the world to see
The rich keep getting richer the poor they just stay poor
Jimmy buffet doesn't' live in Key West anymore
Verse 
Now Jimmy's moved to Malibu with all those other stars
He's not down at in Duval Street hangin' out in bars
All them God damned tourist got to be a bore.
Jimmy Buffet doesn't live here any more
Verse 
So don't tell me I sound like Jimmy Buffet
Just because I got that island beat
Jimmy might have grown up on the ocean
Me I kinda grown up on the street
Music's just a way of life me I'm liv'in free
Don't lay all that Key West Jimmy Buffet shit on me
Verse 
Now Divers Do It Deeper must have really made them mad
Some of them reviewers said it really sounded bad
Well they liked Margaritaville me I liked it too
Someday Jimmy why don't we just both get drunk and screw
Oh those creepy Mother Fuckers that think music is a whore
Tell that you just don't live in Key West anymore
Chorus
There's sailboats and conk shells and palm trees galore
But Jimmy buffet doesn't live in Key West anymore
Sister spare change has a bumper sticker on the door
Says Jimmy Buffet doesn't live here any more <start> You're the one that puts the sparkle in my eyes
You're the one that puts the laughter in my smile
You're the one that puts the meaning in my life
And I'm bubbling over bubbling over bubbling over
Because you are mine
Bubbling over with the joy that only love can bring
Bubbling over with the song you taught my heart to sing
And I'm so happy lovin' you that anyone can see
That I'm bubbling over bubbling over bubbling over
Because you love me
I have never known a love that felt like this
You're the one I want to share my lovin' with
Your gentle way of lovin' me and your thoughtfulness
Keeps me bubbling over bubbling over bubbling over
With happiness
Bubbling over with the joy that only love can bring
Bubbling over with the song you taught my heart to sing
And I'm so happy lovin' you that anyone could see
That I'm bubbling over bubbling over bubbling over
Because you love me <start> I had the key to heaven when we married and for a while I brought you happiness
But now your love for me is dead and buried
And every night you share another's kiss
And I'd rather be the one you slip around with
And be the one who's dream of love is gone
I'd rather be the one you spend your time with than be the one at home all alone
 steel  fiddle 
Deep down inside I know that I should leave you
How many tears was fallen before I learn
I think of many ways that I could grieve you and yet I'm always here when you return
And I'd rather be the one... <start> You saw me crying in the chapel the tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment now I am happy with the Lord
Just a plain and simple chapel where humble people go to pray
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger as I live from day to day
I've searched and I've searched but I couldn't find
No way on earth to gain peace of mind
Now I'm happy in the chapel where people are of one accord
We gather in the chapel just to sing and praise the Lord
Every sinner looks for something that will put his heart at ease
There is only one true answer he must get down on his knees
You'll search and you'll search but you'll never find
No way on earth to gain peace of mind
Take your troubles in the chapel get down on your knees and pray
Your burdens will be lighter and you'll surely find your way <start> She loves the music tells the tales of her heart
And she listens closely to the beats and the parts
She likes the songs that make her cry
And ones that pick her up and make her high
She likes the hiphop she loves to rock it
She's got the country on her iPod on her pocket
She loves the guitar she likes the fiddle
She even likes the ones where they're just talking rhyme and riddles
And she sings along when she's driving home going all alone
Her life's a song
And she likes the songs that take her back and make her want
Sometimes she just wants to dance and move on
She taps her feet and sheds a tear
Plays air guitar and raises a beer
She likes the hiphop she loves to rock it 
She's got the country on her iPod on her pocket
She loves the guitar she likes the fiddle
She even likes the ones where they're just talking rhyme and riddles
And she sings along when she's driving home going all alone
Her life's a song
At times she sings I know just how she feels
A broken heart on a love song that kills
She likes the hiphop she loves to rock it
She's got the country on her iPod in her pocket
She loves the guitar she likes the fiddle
She even likes the ones where they're just talking rhyme and riddles
And she sings along as she's driving home going all alone
Her life's a song
She likes the hiphop she loves to rock it
She's got the country on her iPod in her pocket
She loves the guitar she likes the fiddle
She even likes the ones where they're just talking rhyme and riddles
And she sings along when she's driving home going all alone
Her life's a song
Yeah her life's a song
Yeah her life's a song
She sings along
Her life's a song
Yeah a song <start> Southern lights and how planes fly
Some things I'll never understand
Like me here again tonight
At your memories command
Next thing I'm fighting for this heart of mine
I just can't forget the night I lost you
It's still a mystery after all this time
Though I've tried I just don't get it
You've still got it
Turn the page close the book
Put it on a shelf and let it be
That promise made was all it took
For you to make a lier out of me
Next thing I'm fighting for this heart of mine
I just can't forget the night I lost you
It's still a mystery after all this time
Though I've tried I just don't get it
You've still got it <start> It's easy I know
Friends keep tellin me so
It's purely a matter
Of biding my time
I'm tryin to forget
How to manage it yet
Your Gone
But I can't let you go
I wake up
Each morning and find
Your smile is still hauntin my mind
I'll know that you're gone
But the pain lingers on
Cause you left
All your memories behind
What can I do
I still got you in my heart
When friends come to call
They're no use at all
Though they're tryin their best
To help me I know
Your subject is bound
But they don't understand
That you're gone
But I can't let you go
Your message so clearly defined
Is there in the note that you signed
It's someone you've met
But I'll never forget
Cause you've left all your memories behind <start> You could say that we were destined
For one another's arms
Or maybe we were wishin'
For the moon and stars
No matter what the reason
It's a deadly game we play
These little acts of treason
Will see the light of day
You tell me you don't love her
Then tell me why you stay
You made me a believer
You said it'd be okay
Now I'm standing in the darkness
And we hold each other tight
These little acts of treason
Have never felt so right
With a passion as pure
As an angel's heart
While rivers flow
We'll never part
With a passion that's blind
To all that can see
These little acts of treason
Tell on you and me
I don't want to be a liar
I wanna tell the truth
But I'll probably burn in fire
These things I do for you
So I rage at the heavens
And I'll love you deep inside
These little acts of treason
Are so hard to hide
These little acts of treason
Have never felt so right
These little acts of treason
Are so hard to hide <start> If I should dare
To walk beside her memory
What would I care
If anyone should find me
While you're away
With a lover you call lonely
I could stay
A holy man
But if away I could begin
To send my ashes to the wind
Or call my name as I rescind
Maybe remember me
Maybe remember me
As silence lends itself to lie
So might you and I
Maybe remember me
Maybe remember me
If only I should see the lie
I'm pointing to the sky
Another time
I'd prey upon your body
And let it sink
To every wound inside me
An orange bird
Comes resting on my shoulders
If I speak a word
She'd fly away and I'd grow older
So if away I go begin
To send my ashes to the wind
Or call my name as I rescind
If away I'll always be
Take the endless part of me
Find a place and set it free
Maybe remember me
Maybe remember me
As silence lends itself to lie
So might you and I
Maybe remember me
Maybe remember me
If only I should see the lie
I'm pointing to the sky
Maybe remember me
Maybe remember me
If only I should see the lie
I'm pointing to the sky <start> There's a campfire burning on the Mississippi River bank
My old pickup speakers are cranking out alot of Hank
That's the sheriff's daughter dancin' on my hood
With an empty bottle this can't be good
There's an unwritten law in this sleepy little town
There ain't no drinkin' on the river when the sun goes down
Think I see the blue lights comin' through the woods
Its the sheriff and his posse this can't be good
Everybody is runnin' like the end of the world is comin'
With a Buffard T kinda law man closin' in
She just keeps on rockin' guess I better do some talkin
She's too dumb to run n' I'm too drunk to swim
This can't be good this can't be good this can't be good
Aww stay tuned...
This ol' haybarn's full of last years grass
I got a whole tin can full of campfire gas
Theres a little bitty flame on this piece of firewood
And when it all comes together it can't be good
Everybody is runnin' like the end of the world was comin'
With a wildfire burnin' like a freight train outta control
She just keeps on rockin' babe there ain't no time for talking
Throw her over my shoulder run with everything I can
Hold on babe looks like were jumpin' in...
Now you know when we get to the other side were gonna have to take all
These wet clothes off and hang out awhile... you know this could be good
Yeah <start> One Two Three
A bare foot whore
Walking by a famous car
Against her door
Waiting for the chance to star
Can't sink this town
Fold her gates and bring it down
My private town
I thought you said you were lonely
She pulled the cord
On a night like this she never works
I said no more
Do I think I'm understood this thing
Can't sink this town
Fold her gates and bring it down
My private town
And that you leave me lonely
Ah can't sink this town
Looking back across the sea
I probably drowned
I thought you said you were lonely
Tell you what
Is a broken promise cheap enough
It's all I got
Looks so sad and talks so tough
Can't sink this town
Fold her gates and bring it down
My private town
And that you leave me lonely
Ah Can't sink this town
Looking back across the sea
I probably drowned
I thought you said you were lonely
I thought you said you were lonely
I thought you said you were lonely <start> This afternoon I walked out into a ditch
The crawfish stirred the water
The papermill blew in on the southeastern wind
And it was raining in port arthur
I pulled a dead limb from a fallen pine
The sun was dropping on the lower neches valley
I called the dogs from out of the woods with a hollar
And it was raining in port arthur
That night my daddy drove us to maw maw's
He and mama wanted to be alone
I sat up in that mimosa tree with my brother
And it was raining in port arthur
The refinerys hum and glow from the road
And I listen to the dove as she mourns
I'm standing in the rice fields of beaumont
And it was raining in port arthur <start> Sally told Mary Mary told Jerry Jerry's a spreading it round
That we had a quarrel a foolish quarrel now we're the talk of the town
Well now rumors are flying like leaves in the air whispering that I let you down
And there's one thing for certain it's our love they're hurtin'
They've made us the talk of the town
Sally told Mary...
 guitar 
So please don't believe what they say about me they're trying to keep us apart
I'll swear that I love you there's no one above you yes you are the one of my heart
Sally told Mary... <start> Dark clouds hangin' over me
When will they go away
Rain is in my eyes and I can't see
Life's become just cloudy days
Why she done me like she done
I guess I'll never know
She knows I need her more than anyone
I made a point to let it show
Cloudy days don't the sun ever shine anymore
Stormy weather will you always be around
When I'm down I can't stand cloudy days
I recall a time when times were good
Lord it seems so long ago
But you know they say if rain won't come
Then love has no chance to grow
Cloudy days don't the sun ever shine anymore
Stormy weather will you always be around
When I'm down I can't stand cloudy days
Cloudy days don't the sun ever shine anymore
Stormy weather will you always be around
When I'm down I can't stand...
Cloudy days don't the sun ever shine anymore
Stormy weather will you always be around
When I'm down I can't stand cloudy days
Stormy weather will you always be around
When I'm down I can't stand cloudy days <start> I don't know about tomorrow
I just live for day to day
I don't borrow from the sunshine
For it's skies may turn to gray
I don't worry o'er the future
For I know what Jesus said
And today I'll walk beside Him
For He knows what lies ahead
Many things about tomorrow
I don't seem to understand
But I know who holds tomorrow
And I know who holds my hand
Ev'ry step is getting brighter
As the golden stairs I climb
Ev'ry burden's getting lighter
Ev'ry cloud is silver lined
There the sun is always shining
There no tear will dim the eye
At the ending of the rainbow
Where the mountains touch the sky
Many things about tomorrow
I don't seem to understand
But I know who holds tomorrow
And I know who holds my hand <start> I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
'Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot it's a party
Got this  rocking like a G
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little milehigh flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot it's a party
Got this  rocking like a G
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little milehigh flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
'Cause hey I'm drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot it's a party
Got this  rocking like a G
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little milehigh flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim
But right now
I'm drunk on a plane <start> instrumental <start> Feet up anchor down
Thirty sun block
Getting rubbed around your body
Too hot dive in
Take a little swim
Float around out in the water
Aw what do you say
We stay all day right here
Where the sun sets on tan lines
Footprints on low tide
Boardwalk band plugging in for the night
Party boats are tying up
Cabo drinks are getting drunk
It's all good
It's all right
Just getting high
On a salt life
On a salt life
Cool breeze palm trees
Start to feel ease of a beer buzz and I like it
A little too much
And all i wanna do is stay right here right here with you with you and baby
Soak it up
Don't you love days like this
Where the sun sets on tan lines
Footprints on low tide
Boardwalk band plugging in for the night
Party boats are tying up
Cabo drinks are getting drunk
It's all good
It's all right
Just getting high
On a salt life
On a salt life
Beach bums
Party flip flop
No tick tock on a snowbirds watch
Never stops It never stops it never stops
Where the sun sets on tan lines
Footprints on low tide
Boardwalk band plugging in for the night
Party boats are tying up
Cabo drinks are getting drunk
It's all good
It's all right
Just getting high
On a salt life
On a salt life
Feel so good to live a salt life <start> I like fast cars and shop dreams
Chased a lot of crazy things
Left behind my share of broken pieces
This morning I turned 
And you just remember half of it
You wonder how you outlived Hank or Jesus
I put the rage in a river roll in a thunder
But you kept me from going under
When that current got too heavy
I always thought I'd be a heap of metal
And a cloud of smoke foot stuck to the pedal
Sold for parts like a junkyard rustedout Chevy
Fear I've had none
What the hell made you wanna love
A man who was gonna die young
In the mirror I saw my surprise
Who knew gray hairs like to hide on a head
Didn't think he'd live past thirty
If I make it thirty more
It's the brown that you'll be looking for
As you run your fingers through
Say slow down honey
I put the rage in a river roll in a thunder
But you kept me from going under
When that current got too heavy
I always thought I'd be a heap of metal
And a cloud of smoke foot stuck to the pedal
Sold for parts like a junkyard rustedout Chevy
Fear I've had none
What the hell made you wanna love
A man who was gonna die young
Call it intuition or call it crazy
Just thought by now I'd be pushing up daisies
But I'd gladly stick around if we're together
So baby when you bow your head tonight
Could you tell the Lord I've changed my mind
And with you I'd like to live forever <start> I am reading today in my book of the past
From it's pages so yellow and old.
Each memory of you as I read the book through
Is worth more than silver and gold.

I go back to the time I once called you mine
Oh how happy the sweet long ago.
Each page that I turn seems to make my heart yearn
For the love I no longer share with you.
In this old book of mine many verses I find
That you wrote in the sweet used to be
In my heart there's regret please forgive and forget
And rewrite all the pages for me
 <start> AT THE TIME
Writer Bill Anderson
RECORDED BY JEAN SHPEARD AND BY LYNN ANDERSON
I told him that I loved him cause I loved him at the time
And I told him that I didn't want any other lips touchin' mine
I whispered love your kisses are sweeter than the wine
But I'd never tasted champagne at the time
At the time I didn't know your name and I'd never seen your face
At the time I'd never lost myself in your tender warm embrace
If you've never had filet mignon peanut butter taste just fine
And that's the way it was when I loved him at the time
When I found you I started hearing pretty music I'd never heard
And quietly when we spoke of love it was like I'd learned a brand new word
I once thought I'd seen everything but till I met you I was blind
And I wonder now was I even born at the time
At the time I didn't know your name and I'd never seen your face
At the time I'd never lost myself in your tender warm embrace
If you've never had a Tbone steak saltine crackers taste just fine
And that's the way it was when I loved him at the time
If you've never been to Paris France Big Spring Texas will suit you fine
And that's the way I was when I loved him at the time <start> On a barstool like a damn fool
Hoping she won't think I'm to much older
Just another come on line
To a girl like you in a place like this
And on the dance floor wanting so much more
I crossed that line and got that cold shoulder
You probably think I'm full of it
But I don't think you'll ever find such emptiness
This heart of mine is just looking for
A heart like mine who's just looking for
What it can find
Still looking for a heart like mine
I'm not the only one who's lonely
I find that feeling beating all around me
But with just a night or two
I'd know if you're the one
But now that shoulders getting colder
And soon you'll turn and leave me like you found me
Still way out of line one thing on my mind
And all alone
This heart of mine is just looking for
A heart like mine who's just looking for
What it can find
Still looking for a heart like mine <start> I gotta turn you away so I can keep this hope alive
You're tapping on the window but I won't let you inside
Maybe you'll give up and find somebody else tonight
I draw the curtains say a prayer and turn out the light
Sorrow get away from my door
Don't come around
Don't come around
Don't come around here
No more
I won't welcome you in
From now on you're a stranger
Not a friend
I used to let you crawl right in make yourself at home
You'd burrow underneath my skin and wrap around my bones
But you've worn out your welcome so just walk on past this house
You ain't getting in here and I ain't coming out
Sorrow get away from my door
Don't come around
Don't come around
Don't come around here
No more
I won't welcome you in
From now on you're a stranger
Not a friend

I'm finally feeling strong

But I ain't made of stone

Leave me alone
I ain't going down again
Sorrow get away from my door
Don't come around
Don't come around
Don't come around here
No more
I won't welcome you in
From now on you're a stranger
Not a friend <start> HOW DO YOU TELL SOMEONE

Sadie pull this car over. Let me get me a can of Skoal.
Well we went down to the Grundy County auction
The sign said no tobaccer where we sat
My wife told me that I should spit with caution
Or else we'll all wind up in a big ol' spat
And I said hush your mouth nobody's gonna mind
If I pack my lip and ignore the sign
'Cause a little dip of Skoal never hurt no one at all
Then I've never seen anyone get so mad
From a little bit of spit on his John Deere hat
But I spit on him once spit on him twice
Spit Skoal on the feller in the second row
Well he turned around and nearly broke my nose
I got a big fat lip two black eyes
Shoulda just went and dipped outside
Well it musta been about eight or nine more minutes
Until I pulled that can of Skoal back out
And I knew when I put my fingers in it
That I'd just spit it out amongst the crowd
...Look out
And you know I really don't care if anybody minds
A pinch 'tween your cheek and gum is not a crime
So I'll do my spittin' and to heck with the rest of y'all
Well I've never saw people gettin' so dang mad
Worst County auction they've ever had
'Cause I spit on 'em once spit on 'em twice
Spit Skoal on the people well I must confess
I even got a little on a lady's white dress
But in the end they got me back you see
They all took a dip and spit on me
Well they pinned me down on the auction block
And took my Skoal away
And the town still hates to talk about
The mess that was made that day
When I said hush your mouth nobody's gonna mind
If I pack my lip and ignore the sign
'Cause a little dip of Skoal never hurt no one at all
Well I've never saw people gettin' so derned mad
The worst County auction they've ever had
'Cause I spit on 'em once spit on 'em twice
Spit Skoal on the people well I must confess
I even got a little on a lady's white dress
Shoulda swallowed my dip swallowed my pride
Shoulda just went and spit outsiiiiiiide.
Whew
Boy that was horrible

Well I went down to a Music City function
Where I just heard a song that I had to howl out
My lawyers told my to proceed with caution
Or I'd make a whole lot of songwriters mad
Uhhuh
And I said
Hey John Michael Montgomery won't mind
If I take a song and make it mine all mine
Like I did so many times with old Tim McGraw's
Yeah I never heard anything sound so fine
Mind if I borrow one or two of your lines
Well I stole it once stole it twice
I STOLE it from a writer on Music Row
Well he just moved to town and he didn't know
About ASCAP SESAC or BMI
So he might as well kiss his song goodbye
I had my number two pencil going about a mile a minute
Till I had his ideas all written down
And I knew I really went and did it
When the police came and hauled my butt downtown
And I said
Hey John Michael Montgomery won't mind
If I steal a song and make it mine all mine
Like I did so many times with Tim McGraw's
Yeah I never heard anything sound so fine
Mind if I borrow one or two of your lines
Well I stole it once stole it twice
I STOLE that song and I must confess
When I went to court I plead no contest
Got a big fat lip and two black eyes
Never should have messed with his copyright
Yeah
I told the judge I had writers block but he hauled my butt away
And now it hurts too much to laugh about the song I stole that day
When I said
Hey John Michael Montgomery won't mind
If I steal a song and make it mine all mine
Like I did so many times with Tim McGraw
Yeah I never heard anything sound so fine
Mind if I borrow one or two of your lines
So I stole it once stole it twice
I STOLE it from a writer on Music Row
Well he just moved to town and he didn't know
About ASCAP SESAC or BMI
So he might as well kiss his song goodbye

EYE
STOLE
WHEE <start> Tell me that you love me
Say we'll always work it out
I know it's kinda scary
But it's only temporary doubt
I've done a lot of stupid things
But promise that you're gonna stay long enough to grow old with me
We're gonna see the good times love each other through the bad
It's gonna hurt like hell when we lose our moms and dads
So let my shoulder hold your tears
Walk beside me through the years
Baby let's see where this love could lead
Let's hold hands on your favorite beach
Fix up a house that we found in the city limits
Tangled up in a satin sheet
And get a little loud when we've had to much to drink
And learn to love from a church pew
Laugh about all the times we counted pennies
Buy some land with a good view
To start a family
Baby grow old with me
It's gonna take a little time we'll have to work at it everyday
We're gonna lose a lot of sleep and learn to eat out of a microwave
You know we'll probably never have it all
But that's part of building up the walls strong enough to stand up through the rain
We'll make some love on your favorite beach
And at the house that we found in the city limits
Talk our babies through the bad dreams
When they get a little older we'll tell them not to drink
Book a church when she finds a groom
Laugh about all the times they'll count the pennies
Give them land with a good view
To start a family <start> It's finally come
Is that sorry on your breath
Where were you when
I was sitting back here
Missing you to death
It don't matter now
How I want to know
Can you tell me plain and true
How high will you fly
Without me there to be your sky
Well it don't matter now
Don't mean to leave you
Standing on your own
I think back on days and nights
We had long ago
Maybe love
Is just a game you play
This much I do know
It don't matter now
It's finally come
Is that sorry on your breath
Where were you when
I was sitting back here
Missing you to death
It don't matter now
Now I don't tell stories
And I don't pretend
I won't be around
To say I told you then
'Cause it seems like something's
Finally broken
That'll take a lot of mend
But it don't matter now
Is that sorry on your breath
Where were you when I
Was sitting back here
Missing you to death
It don't matter now
It don't matter now
It don't matter now <start> Everytime I hear that whistle whine
From a lonesome locomotive comin' down the line
It carries my mind away to another place in time
When train travelin' across the land was the only way to fly
Am I a fool to think it glamorous
Boxcarrin' like a hobo it must have been rough
But a simpler way of life is what it really means to me
When we weren't so dependent on money to bee free
I hear you train are you travelin' my way
Won't you let me ride your rails right back to yesterday
Who knows what I could see from that old time machine
But there you go again train travelin'
There you go again train travelin'
I'm lyin' on a rotten wooden floor
Smell yesterday's whiskey here rattlin' at the door
Railroad man lookin' for me I'm scared as I can be
I open my eyes and realize its just another dream
I hear you train are you travelin' my way
Won't you let me ride your rails right back to yesterday
Who knows what I could see from that old time machine
But there you go again train travelin'
There you go again train travelin'
There you go again train travelin' <start> Just follow the stairway to this lonely world of mine
You'll find me waiting here in Apartment No 
Not so very long ago you walked away from me
And after all the plans we made you decided to be free
Loneliness surrounds me without your arms around me
And the sun will never shine in Apartment No 
 piano  steel 
I'll keep waitin' in this lonely room just in case you'd change your mind
You'll find me waiting here in Apartment No 
Loneliness surrounds me...
No the sun will never shine in Apartment No  <start> If I've ever planted flowers in your garden
Or my feet walked across your bedroom floor
Don't be surprised if I'd break the silence of the night with a knock upon your door
I'm just taking a mental journey
And my thoughts may wander back from time to time
Don't be alarmed cause I mean you no harm
I'm just walking with the memories of my mind
When loneliness surrounds me and my future is my past I escape into my dreams
I carefully choose in memories from the medals of my past
That once were dreams and once again
I'm just taking a mental journey
I'm just taking a mental journey <start> Girl I know that I promised you
I could make your every dream come true
But I admit I've got a little ways to go
Trust me baby we're closin' in quick
Before you know it we'll be stckin' the bricks
So stick like glue we got nothin' to lose
And baby don't stop we're just a gettin' started
Don't quit now we got our foot in the door
Say you're not about to end the party
Baby hang on tight just a little bit more
I stand behind every word I say I love you baby
There's your reason to stay
Don't be flip floppin' when you know that we're rockin' along
I can't believe you want to throw in the towel
Stop and think of what I'm talking about
You threw your hat in the ring so go and get that thing
And baby don't stop we're just a gettin' started
Like an old violin or vintage wine all good things come in good time
We might run out of road but it ain't the end of the line
Honey I swear up and down our turn's about to come around
We'll have it all in the long haul
And baby don't stop we're just a gettin' started
Oh baby don't stop we're just a gettin' started <start> The wind can blow cold it moans and it cries
When it carries the sound of a thousand goodbyes
But if you listen tonight on that high lonely plain
You'll just hear my voice as it calls out your name
You'll just hear my voice as it calls out your name
You've been on a road that just don't seem to end
Where that broken old heart of yours won't ever mend
You've crossed over bridges and bridges they burn
So many rivers and so much to learn
So many bridges and so much to learn
But the moon is so full the stars are so bright
And my hand is steady my touch id light
Look in my eyes hold on real tight
And I'll waltz you my darling across Texas tonight
I'll waltz you my darling across Texas tonight
We both have known hard luck
And love that's gone wrong
When the ghosts take the shadows and
The night takes too long
We folded our cards when the hand wasn't strong
But that wheel will keep spinning long after we're gone
Yeah that wheel will keep spinning long after we're gone
And the moon is so full the stars are so bright
And my hand is steady my touch is light
Look in my eyes hold on real tight and I'll
Waltz you my darling across Texas tonight
I'll waltz you my darling across Texas tonight
Look in my eyes hold on real tight
And I'll waltz you my darling across Texas tonight
I'll waltz you my darling across texas tonight <start> Well I won two dollars on a scratch off ticket
So I went back to the counter and I bought two more with it.
And I won ten bucks and that was just right
So I bought a sixpack and a bag of ice.
You know even if our ship came in and this is all we got
It ain't like we really need a million dollar yacht 'cause
We got an innertube
We got a trailer hitch.
We're near the river and far from rich.
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We're laughing all the way to the river bank.
Still can you imagine if we ever struck it
I'd go shoot tequila take a lime and suck it.
And we'd all tell our bosses they can do the same
We'll find a big cruise ship and buy the whole dang thing.
We'd sail around the world and go to shore in a dinghy
But 'til that dream comes go and grab your bikini 'cause
We got an innertube
We got a trailer hitch.
We're near the river and far from rich.
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
And we're laughing all the way to the river bank.
However it goes 
We got it made 
'Cause baby we can float 
We can ride a wave.
We got an innertube
We got a trailer hitch
We're near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
And it's a beautiful day.
We're laughing all the way to the river bank <start> Everywhere you look you can write a book
On the trouble of a woman and a man
But you can not impose you can't stick your nose
Into something that you don't understand
Still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
And who's car is parked next door
I thought I knew her well I really couldn't tell
That she had another lover on her mind
You see it felt so right when she held me tight
How could I be so blind
Still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
And who's car is parked next door
A heart is on the line each and every time
Love is stolen in the shadows of the night
Though it's wrong all along it keeps goin' on
As long as you keep in outta sight
Still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
And who's car is parked next door
Still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
And who's car is parked next door
Still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
And who's car is parked next door <start> Full moon Friday night after the game
Stars must have all lined up early that day
I just turned  she had me by a month
We were young we were green to the taste to the touch
From that very first kiss it was like we were born for that moment
Caught up in the perfect storm
It came in like a flood over the gate
Swallowed us up and it swept us away
We were over our heads me and that girl
We were out of our minds it was out of this world
It was always too much it was never enough
It was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up
It was love
We reigned like the king and the queen of the land
Everyone wanted some of what we had then
Yeah we were the ones they all talked about
Like we were the fire that would never go out
It came in like a flood over the gate
Swallowed us up and it swept us away
We were over our heads me and that girl
We were out of our minds it was out of this world
It was always too much it was never enough
It was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up
It was love
We knew it was coming still it came way too soon
Neither one knew what to say or to do
So we just let the radio play while we danced
We laughed and we cried like I never have since
It came in like a flood over the gate
Swallowed us up and it swept us away
We were over our heads me and that girl
We were out of our minds it was out of this world
It was always too much it was never enough
It was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up
It was love
It was love
It was love
It was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up <start> When your phone rings
When there's a late night knock at your door
When you slow dance when you hold hands
When you're looking for more
Do you wish it was me
Waking up next to you pouring you your coffee
Making love all night long
Do you ever want me
When the sun don't shine
When the rain pours down
When you reach for somebody
Do you wish it was me
At a red light
On a bar stool
Buying you drinks
When he looks at you when he kisses you
When he tells you that he loves you
Do you wish it was me
Waking up next to you pouring you your coffee
Making love all night long
Do you ever want me
When the sun don't shine
When the rain pours down
When you reach for somebody
Do you wish it was me
Do you with it was me
'Cause I wish it was you
Saying your mine baby one more time
Do you wish it was me
Pouring you your coffee
Tell me baby
Do you ever want me
When the sun don't shine
When the rain pours down
When you reach for somebody
Do you wish it was me
'Cause I wish it was you
Do you wish it was me
'Cause I wish it was you
Do you wish it was me <start> Every day I read ads in the paper
Saying come to the islands
Bikini'd ladies sweet rum drinks yeah
They'll keep you smiling
But I've got calypso music on the record at home
And when it comes to the warmth and sunshine
Well I got my own
You're my Jamaica
You're where I want to be
You're my island when I am being
Tossed on a stormy sea
My heavenly haven
Where I can spend eternity
You're my Jamaica
Your paradise to me
White sunny sand palm trees and tans
It's sounds so inviting

Limbo dancing and star light romancing
It's all so exciting
But I got my flowery shirt
And rum punch in my hand
And my own exotic lover in my native land
You're my Jamaica
You're where I want to be
You're my island when I am being
Tossed on a stormy sea
My heavenly haven
Where I can spend eternity
You're my Jamaica
You're paradise to me <start> 
I've heard your voiceI've felt your touch
But only in dreams have I felt this much
I've not seen your faceI don't know your name
But here in my heart you have a place
I'm not for surebut I believe
You're out there waiting for me
I'm waiting for youbiding my time
Keeping my heart from crossing over the line
Counting the days until my dreams come true
I'm waiting for youtaking it slow
Until the moment that I can let go
One day I know I'll say I do
I'm waiting for you
I can go on a date and have a good time
But you're always there in the back of my mind
I'll know it's you when you take my hand
And right by your side is where I will stand
I know how good it's gonna be
The moment that you find me
I'm waiting for youbiding my time
Keeping my heart from crossing over the line
Counting the days until my dreams come true
I'm waiting for youtaking it slow
Until the moment that I can let go
One day I know I'll say I do
I'm waiting for you <start> One of these days you'll turn around
And wanna get out of this someday town
Well people gonna laugh you know what they'll say
You're never gonna get away
Well there'll be fear and there'll be doubt
But they're just things that'll slow you down
Put em all in a great big pile
And stand back
And burn baby like a big ol' fire
Build it up with your one desire
One of these days you just might change their minds
Shine the light blind em by a big ol' fire
Oh big ol' fire
And one of these days you'll find someone
Who lights you up like the rising sun
But he's been hurt and he won't feel
Like handin' you a heart of steel
Don't you run now just you stay
You're the one that can melt away
The loneliness down in his heart
Just take him in your arms
And burn baby like a big ol' fire
Build it up with your one desire
One of these days you just might find the love
You're dreaming of risin' up a big ol' fire
And when you get to where you're goin'
All you'll leave behind is the ashes smolderin'
When you find the love you've always wanted
Oh never let it die
Burn baby like a big ol' fire
Build it up with your one desire
One of these days you just might change their minds
Shine the light blind em by a big ol' fire
Oh big ol' fire
Big ol' fire
Oh a big ol' fire
Burn big ol' fire <start> They tell me that you're going away what makes you want to leave
You gave me your love you gave me your vows now you're leaving me here to grieve
Live and let live don't break my heart don't leave me here to cry
I never could live if we should part so tell me you don't mean goodbye
 guitar 
I stayed awake last night and walked the floor what makes you grieve me so
Live and let live don't break my heart I don't want to live if you go
Live and let live... <start> I found some shade beneath the willow tree
I fell asleep and started dreaming
That everything created here on Earth
All had voices singing
Every rock and every blade of grass
Even the ivy that was clinging
Every leap and every drop of rain
All had voices singing
It brought the angels down
In my dream so clear
And the Lord sat down.
So that he could hear
The sea and waves were rushing to the shore
With the joy that they were bringing
A sound so perfect that it made him cry
To hear their voices singing
I could not help but want to add my own
To all the praises that were ringing
And over all the world there fell a hust
To hear my one voice singing
And as the Lord sat down
The angels hovered near
But they made no sound
So that He could hear
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I heard voices singing
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I heard voices singing <start> Today I started loving you again I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again
What a fool I was to think I could get by with only these few million tears I've cried

Today I started loving you...
Then today I started loving you again <start> It was the summer before the real world started and
The deal was we would get to go if we
Cleaned it up and got it running
Daddy's old Winnebago and
Wing and a prayer down 
Five best friends on four bald tires
I can still see Billy smiling when we finally made it.
To Talladega boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass here's to turning up
Slowing down and cars that go real fast
We were laughing and living drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega
Like a storm time rolls on
You can't hit pause as we just did.
Most days in life don't stand out
But life's about those days that will like
Rocking rando getting rowdy
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon
Til the Alabama sun was breaking
Over Talladega boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass here's to turning up
Slowing down and cars that go real fast
We were laughing and living drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega
Talladega
When the winds go cold and it blows October
I think about us shoulder to shoulder
Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over
In my mind
Tonight I'm in Talladega boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass here's to turning up
Slowing down and cars that go real fast
We were laughing and living drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega
Talladega 
Talladega  <start> I didn't think you had it in you
I've never seen this side of you before
Should I seem and moved girl I don't mean to
It's just that I'm surprised you're at my door
Thinking I could help you
Through your first heartache
Well since you gave me mine
All I know to say
Hurts don't it when love takes its final breath
It's enough to hurt you half to death
When at last your heart gives all that it can give
And the other one don't want it hurts don't it hurts don't it
I didn't think that I had it in me
To ever hold you close like this again
This ain't how I wanted you to need me
But a broken heart takes anything it can
Nothing leaves you lonelier than love when it goes
And if you ever wondered how I felt maybe now you know
Hurts don't it when love takes its final breath
It's enough to hurt you half to death
When at last your heart gives all that it can give
And the other one don't want it hurts don't it
When at last your heart gives all that it can give
And the other one don't want it hurts don't it hurts don't it <start> On the banks of the river
Bb F
where the willows hang down
F Am C Dm
And the wild birds all warble
Dm F
with a low moaning sound
F Am C Dm
Down in the hollow
Dm F
Where the waters run cold
Bb
It was there I first listened
F
To the lies that you told
Now I lay on my bed
And I see your sweet face.
The past I remeber
Time cannot erase.
The letter you wrote me
It was written in shame.
And I know that your conscience
Still echoes my name.
The nights are so long
And sorrow runs deep.
And nothing is worse
Than a night with out sleep.
I'll walk out alone
And look at the sky.
Too empty to sing
Too lonesome to cry.
If the ladies were blackbirds
And the ladies were thrushes
I'd lie there for hours
In the chilly cold marshes.
If the ladies were squirrels
With a high bushy tail
I'd fill up my shotgun
With rock salt and nails. <start> What are those things with big black wings
Circling descending from up over head
Lie to me tell me that they're only robins
Tell me that your love for me will never be dead
Today all the rooms in our home feel like strangers
I wonder what makes me feel so out of place
Why have you suddenly emptied your closets
And why can't you look me in the face
What are those things with big black wings
You faithfully promised you'd never leave me
You told me your heart have no room for goodbyes
But tell me what makes all this distance between us
And who put that leavin' in your eyes <start> On that first day of March the day that she was born
Wild as the wind was on the Friday morn
They all say that she looked evil even then
When her daddy smiled and said that she looked wild as the wind
The fourteen summers passed and she blossomed like a flower
Wild as the wind she grew prettier by the hour
Then one day she found out she could break the minds of men
She became a woman child wild as the wind
Lips as sweet as honey and so eager to please
She comes and she goes just like a summer breeze
I've been beneath her magic spell I know I'll go again
Gotta have that woman child wild as the wind
Gotta have that woman child wild as the wind
Gotta have that woman child wild as the wind <start> I've got to leave that man alone that makes a fool of me
I've got to leave while I've still got my pride
If I'd stay around much longer it'll be too late for me
I'd better listen to that voice I hear inside
That man doesn't love you girl can't you see he's just using you
That man doesn't love you girl that man ain't the man for you
I'd seen the way he looks at girls with hunger in his eyes
And I felt the coldness of his lips on mine
He still tells me he loves me but I can tell he lies
Cause I hear that little voice inside my mind
That man doesn't love you girl...
That man ain't the man for you <start> It was painted red
It's stripe was white
It was  feet
From the bow to the stern light
nd hand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy
When he went there to get her
Put on a shine
Put on a motor
Built out of love
And made for water
Ran it for years
Till the transom got rotton
A piece of my childhood that'll never be forgotten
It was just an old plywood boat
 johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I cant replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn it shore line and make it wide
He'd say ya can't beat the way an old wood boat rides
Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean when daddy let me drive
Just an old  ton shortbed Ford
My uncle bought new in '
Daddy got it right
Cause the engine was smokin'
Couple of burnt valves and he had it goin'
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash
Off of Thickpin Road
I would sit on the seat
And stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal
It was just an old handmedown ford
With  speed on the column
And a dent in the door
A young boy  hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would press that clutch and I'd keep it right
He'd say a lil' slower son you're doin' just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When daddy let me drive <start> Someday we're gonna get away and spend some time together
Someday I'll hold you in my arms and not just my dreams
But as much as I want to love you and feel what lies in store
I don't worry I'm in no hurry 'cause you're worth waiting for
You're like a present with a pretty ribbon shining on a birthday morn
And I'm like a little boy who can't wait to untie the bow
But until the grapes are ripened and the wine is ready to pour
I don't worry I'm in no hurry 'cause you're worth waiting for
I can tell you're well worth waiting for
Everyday only makes me want you more
It's hard to stand outside and wait this close to heaven's door
But I don't worry I'm in no hurry 'cause you're worth waiting for
I don't worry I'm in no hurry 'cause you're worth waiting for <start> What now my love now that you left me
How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turn into ashes
And my hopes into bits of clay
Once I could see once I could feel
Now I am numb I've become unreal
I walk the night but without a goal
Stripped of my heart my soul
What now my love now that it's over
I feel the world closing in on me
Here come the stars tumbling around me
And there's the sky where the sea should be
What now my love now that you're gone
I'd be a fool to go on and on
No one would care no one would cry
If I should live or die <start> Well I love to wander on a sandy shore
And I love to wander down the streets of towns I've never been before
Take me somewhere out of reach lie in unfamiliar sheets
And hear the ocean roar ask for more I could not do just as long as you're there too
Just as long as I have you I'll go anywhere
Just as long as you're there too I don't really care
I'll go anywhere you want cause with you's where I belong
I've just got to have you to make my life complete
I've just got to have you there to be a part of everything I see
In the windows I walk past in the mirror in the morning in my photographs
In the candlelight cafes let me always see your face
And oh it really doesn't matter just where the road leads
To the top of a mountain or down to the sea
Just as long as I have you...
Just as long as I have just as long as I have <start> Pack a change of clothes and a pillow for the road
for when you drift off to sleep
Put the sketches and the notes in the box labeled 'burn with furniture'
We will watch the fire burn the whole entire house we built
down to ashes
From the mirror we'll admire how the flame quickly retires
We won't waste a long goodbye on the smoke or foolish lies
that finally passed us
I was taught to keep an openended life
And never trap myself in nothing
Let's find something new to talk about
I'm tired of talkin' about myself
I spent my whole life talkin' to convince
everyone that I was something else
And the part that kinda hurts is I think it finally worked
and now I'm leaving
I get the feeling things have changed
But the mystery to me is where and when along the way
Did anyone decide that they believed me
I was taught to keep an openended life
And never trap myself in nothing
I was told to keep an openended life
To never trap yourself in nothing
When we settle down in another nowhere town
let's tell our neighbors
We won't be here long and we'll be quiet
but don't go askin' any favors
I can't stand the unexpected uninvited visits
from too many strangers
My trust has dwindled down
And I can leave just as abruptly as I came here
I was taught to keep an openended life
And never trap myself in nothing
I was taught to keep an openended life
To never trap yourself in nothing
I was taught to keep an openended life
And never trap myself in nothing <start> Honey if I'll be a good boy and always say please
If I promise to do all the right things like get down on my knees
And do everything you want me to do eueueueu can I come home to you
Baby I know I acted ugly oh how dumb can I be
But I'm sorry really I'm sorry just look at me see
And I'm so lonesome are you lonesome too eueueueu can I come home to you
If I cross my heart and I hope to die to never never hurt you or tell you a lie
Then will you forgive me I'm begging you to eueueueu can I come home to you <start> Some man dont cheat
so you can come right here with me
shawty i can tell you everything
yeaaa
maybe i can say what you want me to say
i can show you the right man
that you need to get right now
Hey ladys i can tell you
some man dont cheat
if you want to hear the truth
just come right to me
and i acn show you the right man <start> We three kings of Orient are bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain moor and mountain following yonder star
Born a King on Bethlehem's plain gold I bring to crown him again
King forever ceasing never over us all to reign
Star of wonder star of night star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading still proceeding guide us to Thy perfect light
Frankincense and moor have I my gift of love and sacrifice
Pray'r and praising all men raising worship in God most high
Oh star of wonder star of night... <start> It happens to a mother
She is giving birth
Her heart is filled with joy
While her body's filled with hurt
She holds the baby close to her
Despite the pain he caused
When it comes to love you don't count the cost
It happens to a soldier
Fighting for his home
Fear wells up inside him
And yet he still goes on
Even though he knows
He may be the next to fall
When it comes to love you don't count the cost
You don't count the heartache
You don't count the sacrifice
All that counts is what you feel inside
It doesn't really matter what is gained or what is lost
When it comes to love you don't count the cost
It happens all around us
Each and every day
Someone's giving all they got
For someone else's sake
If you ever doubt it
Just think about the cross
When it comes to love you don't count the cost <start> Love hurts love scars love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud holds a lot of rain.
Love hurts uh uh love hurts.
I'm young I know but even so
I know a thing or two I've learned from you
I've really learned a lot really learned a lot
Love is like a stove burns you when it's hot
Love hurts uh uh love hurts.
Some fools rave of happiness
Blissfullness togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
But they're not fooling me
I know it isn't true no it isn't true
Love is just a lie made to make you blue
Love hurts uh uh love hurts. <start> Way down in Columbus Georgia
Want to be back in Tennessee
Way down in Columbus Stockade
Friends all turned their backs on me
Go and leave me if you wish to
Never let it cross your mind
If in your heart you love another
Leave me little darling I don't mind
Last night as I lay sleeping
I dreamt I held you in my arms
When I awoke I was mistaken
I was peering through the bars
Many a night with you I've rambled
Many an hour with you I've spent
Thought I had your heart forever
Now I find it's only lent <start> A long time forgotten
Are dreams that just fell by the way.
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's living today.
But she never complains
Of the bad times or bad things he's done Lord.
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come.
She's a goodhearted woman
In love with a goodtimin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter
They'll pass through this world hand in hand
A goodhearted woman
Lovin' her goodtimin' man.
He likes the night life
The bright lights and goodtimin' friends.
When the party's all over
She'll welcome him back home again.
Lord knows she don't understand him
But she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a goodhearted woman
She loves her goodtimin' man.
She's a goodhearted woman
In love with a goodtimin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter
They'll pass through this world hand in hand
A goodhearted woman
Lovin' her goodtimin' man. <start> Love is gone but not forgotten memories are very much alive
Life goes on and life goes well
But I wonder if I'll ever lose the pain of missing you
Missing you it won't let me be wishing you were missing me
Missing you I'll never be free from missing you missing me
You were here and then you left me
well who's to say where anyone belongs
I know now that I'll get by but I wonder if I'll ever lose the pain of missing you
Missing you it won't let me be <start> Every time I look into your eyes
I want to say that I apologize
I can't change I thought you knew
I'm not the one to stay with you
You don't need a crazy love like mine
That comes and goes from time to time
So save your heart and save your dreams
Forget about me
A girl like you deserves the best
Believe me babe it's in your interest
Forget about me forget about me
Forget about the way we used to touch
Forget about the times we cared so much
Forget about the way our days would end
And all the nights that we would share again
You're old enough to realize
You got to keep your love alive
When you hear the music let it play
Don't let your feelings hide away
Let your love run wild and free
Throw away my memory
You can erase it you can replace it
Forget about me
A girl like you deserves the best
Believe me babe it's in your interest
Forget about me forget about me
Forget about the way we used to touch
Forget about the times we cared so much
Forget about the way our days would end
And all the nights that we would share again
Forget about me
Ooh forget about me <start> She said her mind was made up
As she put on her makeup
Said there was nothing here for her
She just packed up her suitcase
And she walked right out that front gate
With her taxi waiting at the curb
Too many empty nights alone
Too late I realize
It's a cryin' shame it took her tears
To open up my eyes
I should have seen Abilene
On her mind
Her leavin' me and Tennessee
Far behind
Should have seen her growin' lonely
All alone there waitin' on me
All the warnin' sings were there
But I was blind
I should have seen Abilene
On her mind
Last night the band played Dallas
I sang the song I wrote about us
And you could feel the sadness in the air
After the show was over
I a hand lay on my shoulder
Turned around and found her standin' there
She said after all these years
It's nice to know your dreams came true
And the wedding band there on her hand
Told me that hers had to
I should have seen Abilene
On her mind
Her leavin' me and Tennessee
Far behind
Should have seen her growin' lonely
All alone there waitin' on me
All the warnin' sings were there
But I was blind
I should have seen Abilene
On her mind
I should have seen Abilene
On her mind
Abilene
On her mind <start> He came to town with a lot of dreams swapped BMG for KFC
And four strings on his Gibson and now he's frying chicken
He swore someday the world of country music but he held on to his faded dreams
Would be his'n his jeans and cowboy hat
He drove a beat up Chevy truck he still leans in that microphone
And he didn't have no money says you want some fries with that
But he was such a god ole boy
Chorus The last time that I saw him
Back when he was hungry he was singin' down at Tootsie's
He wrote some songs and walked the streets a big tattoo on both his arms
Beggin' folks to listen and his earring was a beauty
Sometimes he crawled just like a snake he said I'm goin' rock'n roll
Without a pit to hiss in those guys make all the money
He looked like Garth and sang like Hank from now on you can call me
And everybody loved him the Artist Formerly Known As Hungry
He swore he'd never change a thing back when he was hungry
Back when BMI and CMA were only letters
And RR was what you took to get to feeling better
And Billboard was a road sign not a chart that came on Monday
Life was oh so simple back then back when he was hungry
And then one day he wrote a song that got someone's attention
The AR at BMG got JOE to listen
Then Joe called James and James called Don
Don called Mrs Hilley and Oermann wrote he's gonna be
The next big hot hillbilly well his record went to Number One
And the good ole boy went crazy he hired a band then fired a band
He toured and then got lazy suddenly he knew it all
The rest of us were dummies he scarcely could remember
Back when he was hungry
Well he married and then he got divorced and met this cute young honey
He thought she craved his body but she only craved his money
She cleaned out his bank account then ran off with his drummer
Left him where he started from back when he was hungry
Well he lost his deal and life got real and he had to give up pickin' <start> I helped you find her diamond ring
You made me try it on and everything
Tomorrow you'll both say I do
And I'll be there 'cause that's what best friends do
I should win an Oscar
Best actress in a show
You always see me smiling
Little do you know
I'm a liar
I'm a liar the biggest liar in the world
I'm crying
I'm crying like I've never cried before
I know you always heard me say
You'll meet the perfect girl one day
The night you called and told me the news
I said I couldn't be more thrilled for you
This might be funny timing
Probably doesn't matter now
I never thought I'd say this but I just figured out
I'm a liar
I'm a liar the biggest liar in the world
I'm crying
I'm crying like I've never cried before
If I ever tell you that I've found the perfect man
That he's everything I've ever wanted just as I had planned
I'm a liar
I'm a liar the biggest liar in the world
'Cause I'll be crying
I'll be crying like I've never cried before
I helped you find her diamond ring
You made me try it on and everything <start> Well I was thumbing through the channels
And I saw a sight to see
A socalled country singer there singing on MTV
And I began to think  had she ever heard a thing
Had she ever been to Texas where Bob Wills is still the king
Ah  ha
From the Houston rodeo to any old dancehall
Of cowgirls and cowboys know how to have a ball
And every night they'll tip a toast to the Lone Star state
Where the women are so fine and the music is so great
Cause I wanna twostep to a real dancehall swinger
I don't wanna see no wannabe country western singer
Don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it
Aw yeah...
All together now....
It's a Texas thing y'all
So if you don't understand just drop what you're doing
Drive here as quick as you can
I'd even stop in Oklahoma if it was up to me
Cause when it comes to country there ain't none like
I wanna twostep to a real dancehall swinger
I don't wanna see no wannabe country western singer
Don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it
That hiphoppin' rappin' boy band crap is for the squirrels in San Francisco
And Nashville is making music that sounds like a dadgum disco
Don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it
Yes I said don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it
That's right... <start> Honestly I can't believe the magic you do
Never seen anything as lovely as you
I was so afraid I was so alone an' blue
I took you in my arms now I'm goin' home with you
I'm gonna wake up in your arms tomorrow
You gonna make it the night of my life
I'm gonna wake up in your arms tomorrow
Thank you for takin' me to paradise tonight
I was so afraid I was so alone an' blue
An' I took you in my arms now I'm goin' home with you
I'm gonna wake up in your arms tomorrow
You gonna make it the night of my life
I'm gonna wake up in your arms tomorrow
Thank you for takin' me to paradise tonight
Ooh so this is paradise
Ooh so this is paradise
Paradise all night
I'm gonna wake up in your arms tomorrow
You gonna make it the night of my life
I'm gonna wake up in your arms tomorrow
Thank you for takin' me to paradise tonight
Ooh so this is paradise
Ooh so this is paradise
Paradise all night
I'm gonna wake up in your arms tomorrow
You gonna make it the night of my life
I'm gonna wake up in your arms tomorrow
Thank you for takin' me to paradise tonight <start> Well they shouldn't have played that good
I got carried away and let the music
Go to my head.
Well she shouldn't have worn that dress
The way it curled around when she was spinnin'
Just killed me dead.
My heart began to tell my body and my soul
That it had gotten in the mood to lose control.
Oh no
When did neon light turn into moon glow
When did that jukebox turn into a rainbow
I'm about to give into this urge.
Once more slow dance
With her arms around me
One more long glance
And nothing will slow down me
I've got no chance
If I'm not in love I'm on the verge.
All I wanted to be was cool.
It ain't my style to over heat
Much less burn.
But as we floated across the floor
All at once I flashed right past the point
Of no return.
And when we said goodnight
The sun was on the rise
And any stars that hadn't set
Had fallen in my eyes.
Oh no
When did neon light turn into moon glow
When did that jukebox turn into a rainbow
I'm about to give into this urge.
Once more slow dance
With her arms around me
One more long glance
And nothing will slow down me
I've got no chance
If I'm not in love I'm on the verge. <start> There is no love and there is no hate
There is no feeling at all
I look at you and you look at me
But we might as well stare at the wall
Cause you don't see me and I don't see you
Just a shadow of love that is gone
There is no love and there is no hate
No reason to hurry home
There's no tiny hands to reach out to us
No plans bein' made anymore
We have no tomorrow our future is gone
There's only sadness in store
We don't care enough to even ask questions
And when we're together we still feel alone
There is no love and there is no hate
No reason to hurry home
There is nothing to look forward to
No reason to hurry home <start> As I sit here tonight the jukebox playin'
The tune about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words you are sayin'
It brings memories when I was a trusting wife
It wasn't God who made Honky Tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame
It wasn't God who made Honky Tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong <start> bluegreen and dappled
spidery light
white wedding china
cut crystal glasses
a trunk of old linens
silver that's tarnished
at home in the sea
at home in the sea
at home in the sea
arrival uncertain
departure confirmed
unknown destination
lost in a letter
sent from behind
where the only return
at home in the sea
at home in the sea
at home in the sea
did you send the piano
the tables and chairs
the lamp with the silk shade
we kept in the hallway
the books by my bedside
the family photos
i forgot to bring
i forgot to bring
at home
in the sea <start> I think I think I got it under control
Then a curve ball hits the glass
And the world comes crashin' down
We stand staring at a fork in the road
Lookin' down two long lonely paths
Why can't we just turn around
Chorus
And believe every fight uphill is worth it
Every teardrop has a purpose
It just clears your eyes to see
Believe storms don't last forever
What don't kill you just makes you better
Oh baby believe
We say we say so much that we regret
And we leave so much unspoken
Still we can't see what's missing
Our hearts know exactly what to do
As they cry out in the dar
Why can't we just stop and listen
Chorus
Faith in me and faith in you
Hope's alive if only you
Believe
Believe storms don't last forever
What don't kill you just makes you better
Oh baby believe
Believe <start> Tell you a little story and it won't take long
'Bout a lazy farmer who wouldn't hoe his corn
The reason why I never could tell
For that young man was always well
He planted his corn in the month of June
And by July it was up to his eyes
Come September came a big frost
And all the young man's corn was lost
His story kith had just begun
Said Young man have you hoed some corn
Well I tried and I tried and I tried in vain
But I don't believe I raised no grain
He went down town to his neighbor's door
Where he had often been before
Sayin' Pretty little miss will you marry me
Little miss what do you say
Why do you come for me to wed
You can't even make your own corn grain
Single I am and will remain
A lazy man I won't maintain
He turned his back and walked away
Sayin' Little miss you'll rue the day
You'll rue the day that you were born
For givin' me the devil 'cause I wouldn't hoe corn <start> You told me that your love was true
Sweetheart I thought the world of you
But now you left me all alone
I have no one to call my own
Now sweetheart you've done me wrong
You have left me all alone
Maybe there will come a time
Sweetheart when you will change your mind
I never shall forget the day
When you said you were going away
I couldn't believe that it was true
After all the love I had for you
Now sweetheart you've done me wrong
You have left me all alone
Maybe there will come a time
Sweetheart when you will change your mind
This road is rough and rocky too
As I travel on dear without you
But I'm still praying for the time
Sweetheart when you will change your mind
Now sweetheart you've done me wrong
You have left me all alone
Maybe there will come a time
Sweetheart when you will change your mind <start> I'm a western North Carolinean made of stone and red place oil
I got Cherokee blood deep within me when I was born it began to boil
Well I left my home across the mountains to see what kind of life I'd find
Well I searched the world in all directions to try to cool this restless mind
 dobro 
Found myself on a lonesome journey the streets of gold I tried to find
The Indian spirit it softly whispered and cooled the blood ever restless mind
I'm going back to the Smokey Mountains and breathe the air that fit my soul
Now there we read in the leaves of history and there I'll find my streets of gold
And there I'll find my streets of gold <start> If the wife and I are fussin' brother that's our right
Cause me and that sweet woman's got a licence to fight
Why don't you mind your own business mind your own business
Cause if you mind your own business then you won't be mindin' mine
On the woman on our party line's a nosey thing
She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring
Why don't you mind your own businesss mind your own business
So if you mind your own business then you won't be mindin' mine
Well I got a little gal that wears her hair up high
The boys all whistle out every time she walks by
Why don't you mind your own businesss mind your own business
For if you mind your own business then you won't be mindin' mine
 guitar 
If I wanna honky tonk around till two or three
Brother that's my headache don't you worry bout me
Why don't you mind your own businesss mind your own business
So if you mind your own business then you won't be mindin' mine
Mindin' other people's business seems to be hightone
But I got all that I can do just midin' my own
Why don't you mind your own businesss mind your own business
For if you mind your own business then you won't be mindin' mine
For if you mind your own business you'll stay busy all the time <start> If you don't want me baby
If you ain't satisfied

And ride ride ride
Since you got on your high horse
New fancy friends you've found
You don't even notice me
You don't look that far down
If you don't want me baby
If you ain't satisfied
If you don't care get on your horse
And ride ride ride
You talked about me honey
You tried to tear me down
But while you're throwin' dirt at me
You're only losin' ground
If you don't want me baby
If you ain't satisfied
If you don't care get on your horse
And ride ride ride
I'll have your second fiddle
Returned to you today
'Cause baby that's one instrument
I never learned to play
If you don't want me baby

And ride ride ride
If you don't want me baby
If you ain't satisfied
If you don't care get on your horse
And ride ride ride <start> I got a good foundation
On a bad reputation
Got a floor I've been pacing
And a broken heart breaking
In a game of fools
I'd be hard to beat
Yeah if losing's a game
I'm on a winning streak
I got a bottle that's empty
And a  that gets me
If I was me I'd quit me
When I gambled my last 
On a game of fools
But it ain't easy streak
Yeah if losing's a game
I'm on a winning streak
Hey hey I'm on a roll
Gone as low as a low can go
Standing at the old crossroads
Damned old devil won't buy my soul
Hey hey I blow on the dice

This old town it don't play nice
Hit me once hell hit me twice
If losing's a game
I'm on a winning streak
Yes I am
Well my mind is unadjusted
And my guitar strings are rusted
Had somebody that I trusted
Leave me broke and busted
On a game of fools
Now I'm drowning in defeat
Yeah if losing's a game
I'm on a winning streak
Oh baby if losing's a game
I'm on a winning streak
Hey I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll now child
I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll now baby
Hey I'm on a roll
Hey I'm on a roll
Hey I'm on a roll now baby <start> 
She's a rounder I can tell you that
She can sing 'em all night too
She'll raise hell about the sleep she lost
But even cowgirls get the blues
Especially cowgirls they're the gypsy kind
And need their laid on 'em loose
She's lived to see the world turned upside down
Hitchin' rides out of the blues
But even cowgirls get the blues sometimes
Bound to don't know what to do sometimes
Get this feelin' like she's too far gone
The only way she's ever been
Lonely nights are out there on the road
Motel ceiling stares you down
There must be safer ways to pay your dues
But even cowgirls get the blues
Even cowgirls get the blues sometime
Bound to don't know what to do sometimes
Get this feelin' like she's too far gone
The only way she's ever been
Even cowgirls get the blues sometime
Bound to don't know what to do sometimes
Get this feelin' like the restless wind
The only way she's ever been <start> Love built the house that I am livin' in livin' in livin' in
Well love built the house that I am livin' in and I'm happy in my house of love
Well happy little birds are singin' in my house of love
Joy to every heart they're bringin' in my house of love
Love built the house...
Oh every day the sun shines brighter in my house of love
Every day my heart is lighter in my house of love
Love built the house...
Oh clouds have found with silver linin' in my house of love

I don't understand you oh girl
It's almost as though you prefer me to them
Just on the fringe of your world
As much as I love you
You're costing me part of my mind
What am I supposed to do with the part of me
That you don't want but part of the time
As much as I love you
Why do you lock me outside
And only let me in every now and then
What are you trying to hide
As much as I love you
I don't understand how you think
Don't you know that it's wrong turnin' me off and on
Like water you pour down the sink
As much as I love you
It's cold on my side of the bed
It's been another day of bein' pushed away
And I don't know what I've done or said
As much as I love you
I'm lying here wondering why
I don't take off my ring
Pack up my things leave and don't even say goodbye
Mhm mhm <start> My Buddy Jake said hey its spring break so I picked him up in my truck
We rode into town and there we found a cantina and sorority bus
I started trading my lines with a tall blond hair kappa delta
She said boy what school are you from I said I'd be happy to tell ya
I'm from the dirt road poison ivy league of campfires guitars and river swings
Got the good life down and if you hang around we can get a little dust on that collar
'Cause I'm a genuine certified dirt road scholar
Graduated the top of the school of hard knocks
Pass the bar anytime I ain't thirsty
My country clubs exclusive to none but a fishing pole would come in handy
No you ain't really lived till you get chill bumps from a coyote cry
Or fine dine till you've cooked on a mountain
Lightning bugs for candle light yeah
I'm from the dirt road poison ivy league of campfires guitars and river swings
Got the good life down and if you hang around we can get a little dust on that collar
Cause I'm a genuine certified dirt road scholar <start> Sun just dropped off the face of the Earth
World just washed off a hard day's work
Band's about to kick off the night and the first song

There's a sevenfortyseven cutting cross the sky
Granny and her slippers kissing pa goodnight
Gonna lock down the hatch til the first butt crack of dawn
And we're just getting started
Drinking picking singing
Dropping our lines and hitting on strangers
If you're down get up if you're in get out
Pop a top and fire up this party
Hey hey we're just getting started
We the people of the midnight hour
Silver bullet proof full of whisky power
Getting louder and louder as the night rolls on
And getting drunk and stoned
We're the all night owls and the neon lighters
Liquored up lovers and bar room fighters
And we ain't slowing down
When the light weight crowd goes home
'Cause we're just getting started
Drinking picking singing
Dropping our lines and hitting on strangers
If you're down get up if you're in get out
Pop a top and fire up this party
Hey hey we're just getting started
Yeah don't you hate it when the night runs out of time
And you still got some moon in a jug of shine
Birds are singing and bringing on daylight
And we're just getting started
Drinking picking singing
Dropping our lines and hitting on strangers
If you're down get up if you're in get out
Pop a top and fire up this party
Hey hey we're just getting started
Oh yeah we're just getting started <start> Written by billy burnette and larry henley.
Gone again somebody help me i'm
Sinkin' in
Deeper this time than I've ever been
Ooh baby I'm gone again
Well I promised myself a million times
Nobody else gonna mess up my mind
Don't ask me how it happened 'cause i
Don't know
You must have slipped up on me through
My back door
I don't know
I'm gone again somebody help me i'm
Sinkin' in
Deeper this time than I've ever been
Ooh baby I'm gone again
Well I'm goin' goin' gone so long babe
I'm gone again <start> Moon coming through the pines cranking up a country song
Heaven right by your side and a Saturday night barely hanging on.
Sun shining through the stained glass humming just as I am.
I'm praying that feeling would last that feeling that saves you
Makes you wanna raise your hands.
That's the way it was and that's the way it is when you're growing
Up in the mud and buck the way we did.
It got me where I am and where I'm gonna go.
We learned all about believing
And everything we were ever gonna need to know.
Somewhere between the back roads and the back row.
I had my first taste of beer
My first taste of a broken heart
There were good times there were tears
But every red dirt memory left a mark
Like the words written there in red
Like the streets that are made of gold
Where we always bowed our heads where momma saved our seats
And Jesus saved our souls
That's the way it was and that's the way it is when you're growing
Up in the mud and buck the way we did.
It got me where I am and where I'm gonna go.
We learned all about believing
And everything we were ever gonna need to know.
Somewhere between the back roads and the back row. <start> A REAL CLOSE FRIEND

' Glad Music

The girl that you described sounds so familiar
The one you say you've loved for quite some time
Are you sure there's no mistake for I have a feeling
That your real love's a real close friend of mine
Well I am glad we've had this little talk together
For at last I began to see the light
I've been spending many lonely nights here lately
All because of that real close friend of mine

Well I'll bet she says each day her love grows stronger
And if you left she'd surely lose her mind
And if she ever makes you feel unwanted
Then I think you know a real close friend of mine
Yes I am glad we've had this little talk together...
All because of a real close friend of mine <start> Had a bottle of wine and a perfectly fine dinner
Talk about school work life and how cold it was last winter
Lay down in this big 'ole bed and you turned on the TV
Fell asleep without a goodnight kiss or even an I love you
Baby oh baby
How can we go on tonight and not even touch one another
How can we say we're still in love and not be lovers
How did we get here where you can be right there
And I can be with you and miss you
I remember the time when every time you saw me you had to kiss me
But lying here tonight
Girl that all just seems like ancient history oh what happened baby
How can we go one night and not even touch one another
How can we say we're still in love and not be lovers
How did we get here where you can be right there
And I can be with you and miss you
Baby I still need you
Hold and touch you
Please say it's not the end
Oh baby please say we're not just friends
We can go all night
And not even touch one another no
Baby I'm I'm still in love
So let's be lovers
You know it's not fair
That you can be right there
And I can be with you
Oh oh and miss you
Oh baby I I miss you darlin'
Oh I do oh I do layin' right next to you
I miss you girl
Oh yeah oh baby I miss you <start> Take my hand for awhile explain it to be once again
Just for the sake of my broken heart
Look into my eyes and maybe I will understand
How love I counted on was never there
You see I've thought that you might love me
So you caught me it seems off valums with the heart that's full
Of love and pretty dreams that two should share
Look into my eyes and maybe I will understand
How love I counted on was never there
And so I know but please before you go
Take my hand for awhile explain it to be once again
Just for the sake of my broken heart
So take my hand for just awhile <start> Now if I were a queen and a ruler of nations
With diamonds and jewels profound
Well I'd rather know that I had salvation
Than to know my reward would be Satan's jewel crown
Satan's jewel crown I've worn it so long
But God for my soul has reached down
His love set me free He made me His own
And helped me cast off Satan's jewel crown
Oh the life that I live so sinful and needless
Drinkin' and runnin' around
All the things that I do for the love of the Devil
I know my reward will be Satan's jewel crown
Satan's jewel crown I've worn it so long
But God for my soul has reached down
His love set me free He made me His own
And helped me cast off Satan's jewel crown <start> Sweetheart if you should stray a million miles away
I'll always be in love with you
And though you'll find more bliss in someone else's kiss
I'll always be in love with you
I can't do any more I've tried so hard to please
But let me thank you for such tender memories
I wish you happiness as for me sweetheart I guess
I'll always be in love with you

I can't do any more <start> You saved me from melting baby
You saved me from stinging and being holed up
And braking in snow and killing more
And over spilling my runneth cup
You had light in your hands and your eyes closed
You had movement out of my sight
You wore no shoes and ate like a leopard
And slept with your legs apart every night
And if I had to live
This is what it should be
To have such a woman with me
When tidal wave hit and our house was in splinters
I thought you had took all you had to take
But you snuggled to me on the ground in the winter
And your breath smelled like honey in the frosty air wake <start> There's gotta be some changes made round here
I can't go on like this and that's for sure
Yes I've gotta know is it stop is it go should I leave or stay am I just in your way
There's gotta be some changes made round here
There's gotta be some changes made round here
For I can't stand another lonely night of fear
Don't be so unkind I'm almost out of my mind do I fit in your plans
Please tell me where I stay there's gotta be some changes made round here

Yes I've gotta know...
There's gotta be some changes made round here <start>  x
In a world of deceivers can't find no believers
Could it be that there's none of them left
Dumped in a river when I was delivered
The doctor he cursed me under his breath
sayin Boy just be thankful you're breathin'
Don't be wishin' for no one to care
Boy you won't ever get even
There ain't no place for that around here x
Why's the devil always got his foot on my neck x
In a world full of others can't find me a brother
Could it be I'm a bastard or worse
Was left here to suffer by my starvin' mother
My father he hung on the day of my birth
Said boy just be thankful you're breathin'
Don't be wishing for no one to love
Boy don't be thinkin' of thievin'
You'll pay for your sins below or above x
 x
In a life full of trouble that's never been subtle
You could say I'm the prince of all pain
'cos if heartache's a kingdom I'd have wealth and dominion
And all of my debts they would surely be paid
Boy just be thankful you're breathing
Don't be wishin' for no one to care
No there's no way to get even
There ain't no place for that around here
Why's the devil always got his foot on my neck x
Thought I could bargain with the father of lies
I tried to make my peace of the edge of a knife
Why am I so surprised to be playing with fire
Got hell to pay the fiddler when the deal expires
Get your foot off my neck x
Get your foot up off my neck <start> He was just a baby
The only son of man
They all came to see Him
Three wise men to Bethlehem
Baring gifts that could not compare
To the gift of eternal life
That our Savior gave to us
That first Christmas night
Don't you know the angels were singing
Cause they knew all the joy that He was bringing
Oh I wish I could have been to there
To witness the birth of Christ
And feel what they felt on that
First Christmas night
It must have been a wonderful thrill
To watch Him take His first breathe
And to see His mother Mary hold Him
Close to her chest
How she looked she looked in His eyes
What it must have been a sight
Wish I felt the love she felt on that
First Christmas night
Don't you know the angels were singing
Cause they knew all the joy that He was bringing
Oh I wish I could have been to there
To witness the birth of Christ
And feel what they felt on that
First Christmas night
Oh why can't I feel what they felt
On that First Christmas night <start> Steppin' out steppin' high step on back check my stride
I'm ready for anything come Saturday night
Got my twotones on the dance floor's their home
I'm just a honky cat honkin' down at the honky tonk
I'm goin' down on Whiskey Row
Where them good lookin' high heeled honeys go
Those free wheelin' girls sure 'nuff a friend
Of a flat natural born good timin' man
My uncle Joe Dan was a lady's man
He taught me the what to do's and when's
And when I'm through with you you won't wanna move
You'll lay on back and smile at what you've just gone through
I'm goin' down on Whiskey Row
Where them good lookin' high heeled honeys go
Those free wheelin' girls sure 'nuff a friend
Of a flat natural born good timin' man
I'm a flat natural born good timin' man <start> My pappy said son you gonna drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln
Have you heard the story about the hot rod race
When the Ford and the Lincoln were settin' the pace
That story's true I'm here to say
Cause I was a drivin' that Model A
It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up
That Model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got eight cylinders and uses them all
And an overdrive that just won't stall
It's got a barrel carb and dual exhausts
 gears that really get lost
Safety tubes and I'm not scared
The brakes are good and the tires are fair
We left San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars were shinin' bright
We were drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passin' cars like they were standin' still
Then all of a sudden in the wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
I said boys that's the mark for me
But by then the taillights was all you could see
Now the fellers ribbed me for bein' behind
So I started to make that Lincoln unwind
Took my foot off the gas and man alive
I shoved it down into overdrive
Well I wound it up to hundred and ten
Twisted the speedometer cable hit top end
Had my foot glued right to the floor
I said that's all there is there ain't no more
Now the fellas thought I'd lost all sense
The telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said slow down I see spots
The lines on the road just looked like dots
I took a corner and passed a truck
I crossed my fingers just for luck
The fenders clickin' the guard rail post
The guy beside me was white as a ghost
Smoke was comin' outta the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
I knew I could catch him and hoped I could pass
But when I did I'd be short on gas
Had flames comin' from out of the side
You could feel the tension man what a ride
I said look out boys I've got a license to fly
And the Cadillac pulled over and let me by
Now all of a sudden a rod started knockin'
Down in the depths she started a rockin'
I looked in the mirror and a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln
They arrested me and put me in jail.
They called my pop to throw my bail.
And he said son you're gonna drive me to drinkin'
If you don't quit drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln <start> She used to dream that She would be a celebrity and known for miles around
She'd dress up in her linens She'd sit and pretend She was a queen in Her gown
But I was just a boy from down the road and I was known as trouble in town
Thought to be the man who took the hand and changed the plans of sweet Jessie Brown
Chorus
Sweet Jessie Brown
Would you look at you now
She graduated early and to prep school we new surely
She was bound
Everybody tried to warn
Her I would be the one to try to bring
Her down
Because I told
Her there's a hole world out there for the two of
Us and it's waitin' to be found
And knew to be the man who would take the hand
And change the plans of sweet Jessie Brown
Chorus
On a road bound for nowhere a baby's cryin' was the only sound
Then the baby stopped it's crying and Jessie's world came tumblin' to the ground
I found a pill box on the dresser and note that She died holding in Her hand
It read I goodbye dear I love you and I'm sorry signed Jessie Brown
Chorus <start>  John Johnson and Leon Rhodes 
Old love new tears cause from seeing you again last night
Old love new tears I just stood there crying till you were out of sight
For you were with your new love and you passed me right on by
I tried my best to give a smile but mem'ries made me cry
Old love new tears cause from seeing you again last night
 steel 
Old love new tears...
I turned around and slowly walked away
These tears I knew that I had shed would fall like this someday
Old love new tears cause from seeing you again last night <start> Well you cheat me everytime I turn my face
I'm on your  out of a race
No don't believe I will yes I'll stick around close to you
Gonna go way off forget you too I find me a gal a lot better than you
No I don't believe I will yes cause I'll take the chance on losin' you
 steel 
Gonna walk right up walk up to you and sister I'll tell you I'll 
No don't guess I will guess I'll keep on chasin' you
If I see you at date I get one too struggle right in front of you
No I don't believe I will pray I'll suffer more than you
 guitar 
Spend my money you think I'm sore baby I'm gonna catch you on the row
No don't believe I will cause that's one way of keepin' you
Gonna jump in the well and end it all and listen to you holler squall and ball
No don't believe I will but I couldn't get long at all <start> Well I've been sitting here just thinking
Dealing with my feelings about leaving
Trying to keep from drinking
And every day I pray that I make it through one more day
Without giving in to the only friend who can take the pain away
Man believe me it would be easy
Cause I could go there
It wouldn't get me nowhere
Just a shot it all it takes to bring her back
And when the bottle's empty
It will only leave me
Holding on to nothing more than memory and a glass
You see there ain't no future pouring good whiskey on the past
So what am I doing here
I know it don't make sense
Everybody knows a bar and a broken heart
Are two things that just don't mix
But I can't go home
Oh the thought of being there alone
With a bottle on the shelf
Saying go and help yourself
Man I know I'm not that strong
Man believe me cause it would be easy
Well I could go there
But it wouldn't get me nowhere
Just a shot is all it takes to bring her back
And when the bottle's empty
It will only leave me
Holding on to nothing more than memory and a glass
See there ain't no future pouring good whiskey on the past <start> Hell yeah Amen
Hallelujah how ya been
 point  ball
First base last call
Chrome grill mudflap
Party back in the pines
Fight song tom tom
Friday night pom pom
Redneck hip hop
County courthouse clock
Beauty shop turnin' off that open sign
Anywhere the crossroads hit

Doesn't matter where it is
I can tell ya this
We'll be hittin' that Main street hot on a cool night
Sneakin' a six pack kiss at the red light
Circlin' up out back behind that Texaco
Brushin' the blonde hair out of her blue eyes
Countin' the stars out under the big sky
Passin' the bottle round just to see how far it goes
Some folks swear we ain't got one prayer left inside
But I know everything's gonna be alright
As long as this is goin on in  towns tonight
Steeples dive bars
Air and water no charge
Everybody knows who's goin' to the graveyard
Pulls over as they're passin' by
Yeah that circle's gonna be unbroken in the by and by
Later on tonight
We'll be hittin' that Main street hot on a cool night
Sneakin' a six pack kiss at the red light
Circlin' up out back behind that Texaco
Brushin' the blonde hair out of her blue eyes
Countin' the stars out under the big sky
Passin' the bottle round just to see how far it goes
Some folks swear we ain't got one prayer left inside
But I know everything's gonna be alright
As long as this is goin on in  towns tonight

 towns tonight <start> I've had to buy back damn near everything I own
From a little man whose name is Saul
And has a lot of money to loan
I drive a beat up ' Chevrolet
With a torn up seat
That pokes a brand new hole in my back near every day
I got a letter from the folks over at Bell
Just to let me know for my next phone call
I could walk outside and yell
Hey I know my life seems a mess
But honey things to me still look real swell
'Cause I've got you to see me through
Yeah I've got you to chase my blues
I've got you to ease my pain
Yeah I've got you girl to keep me sane
So let them do what they want to do
'Cause it don't matter long as I've got you
I've got the landlord breathing down my neck for rent
He don't give a damn about my kids or where the money was spent
And after all those years of payin' union dues
It sure didn't seem to count for much when we got our layoff news
I got a note from the man over at the bank
Said the next  gallons of gas I buy won't be going in my tank
Hey I know I might seem near dead
But honey I think I might just get well <start> My mind has been in a constant burl since the day that I met you girl
I've never had a feelin' like this to come over me
I can't sleep a wink I can't eat a bite I toss and tumble in my sleep all night
Baby it's the feelin' that I just can't fight I'm comin' down with love
Comin' down with love such a good feelin' all over my body
Your sweet love is all over me
Gone are my heartaches my heartbreaks I feel just like a new man
Comin' down with love I'm down with love
When I'm with you that's my desire my heart is like a burnin' flame of fire
Your kisses end cold chills up and down my spine
I've never had a good feelin' like this before it feels so good I'm a beggin' for more
No doubt about it it's for sure I'm comin' down with love
Comin' down with love... <start>  Both 
Sweet dream babby sweet dream baby sweet dream baby how long must I dream

Rattled at the door just like thunder.
Who is that Mister Hendley cried
It is my husband You must hide
She held the door till old man Hendley
Jumping and jerking went up the chimney.
John come in looked all around
But not a soul could be found.
John sat down by the fireside weeping
Up the chimney he got to peeping.
There he saw the poor old soul
Sittin' astraddle of the potrack pole.
John built on a rousing fire
Just to suit his own desire.
His wife called out with a free good will
Don't do that for the man you'll kill
John reached up and down he fetched him
Like a racoon dog he catched him.
He blacked his eyes and then he did better
He kicked him out upon his setter.
His wife she crawled in under the bed
He pulled her out by the hair of the head.
 When I'm gone remember this
And he kicked her where the kicking is best.
The law came down and John went up
He didn't have the chance of a yellow pup
Sent him down to the old chain gang
For beating his wife the dear little thing.
When he got off he went back to court
His wife she got him for nonsupport.
John didn't worry and John didn't cry
But when he got close he socked her in the eye.
Took John back to the old town jail
His wife she come and paid his bail.
Won't be long till he'll be loose 
I could tell more about it but there ain't no use. <start> I hadn't been there I haven't done that
I never been one to know where it's at
I've been around and I've seen a few things
I don't know what a lot of it means
The truth never ring clear as a bell but I
Don't believe that you never can tell
Most things I don't have a clue
But I can tell by lookin' I know all about you
You don't have to put your hand in the fire
To know your little fingers are gonna get burned
You don't have to be standing on the moon
To know your little planet is gonna get turned
You don't have to take a walk in the sea
To know it gets a little deep and it's really not blue
I don't have to have my arms all around you
To know I wanna hold you and to know that I love you
I've never been one to go to extremes
I see'em coming and I get in between
Never ahead and never behind
I figure everything happen in time
And just in time it's happening now
It's not up to either one of us to ever know how
With both eyes closed I could easily see
It's happening to you and it's gonna be me
You don't have to put your hand in the fire
To know your little fingers are gonna get burned
You don't have to be standing on the moon
To know your little planet is gonna get turned
You don't have to take a walk in the sea
To know it gets a little deep and it's really not blue
I don't have to have my arms all around you
To know I wanna hold you and to know that I love you
You don't have to put your hand in the fire
You don't have to be standing on the moon

You don't have to take a walk in the sea
To know it gets a little deep and it's really not blue
I don't have to have arms all around you
To know I wanna hold you and to know that I love you
You don't have to put your hand in the fire
No not to feel the heatno
You don't have to be standing on the moon
Not to know that I took
You don't have to take a walk in the sea
It's gettin' deepI know it's gettin' deep now
You don't have to put your hand in the fire
Ahh not to feel the heatno
You don't have to be walkin' on the moon
I don't have to have my arms all around you
To know I wanna hold you and to know that I love you
Yes I do <start> The heel of my boot is on the leg of my chair
My chair leans back and rests on the wall
And the wall runs the length of my room to the door
The door reaches down to the sidewalk
And sidewalk leads to the edge of the street
The street takes you out to the old highway
The highway ends at the countyline bridge
The bridge takes you up to the interstate
The interstate rolls on beyond my horizon
Where miles tend to turn into days
Finally runs into high road that winds through the city
That took you away
And it reaches the sidewalk that kisses a wall
And the wall rises up to the rd floor
The floor feels you step to the balcony rail
From the rail you look out on the interstate
The interstate rolls on beyond the horizon
A highway of dreams come and gone
Always leads the roads that connect you
to the fool that keeps holding on
The heel of my boot is on the leg of my chair
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah <start> Sweet sweet were the lips that kissed me
Warm warm were the arms that held me

To give our hearts a double shot

And still you want me to set you free
We've been through thick and thin together
Braved the fair and stormy weather
We've had all the hard times you and I
And now that I'm a big success
You called today and you confessed
And told me things that make me want to die
You told me there's another man
Who can give more than I can
And I've given everything that cash will buy
You can buy me a peaceful night
With loving arms around me tight
And you're too busy to notice
The hurt in my eyes

Your old cheatin' heart has finally caught you
A thousand times I told you that it would
A great big wall has come between us
And I wouldn't even love you if I could
So don't think it ain't been fun cause it ain't
Don't think I still can't care cause I can't
Don't think my mind won't change cause it won't
Don't think I don't love you cause I don't
Well all my tossing and turning nights are over
I don't even feel a touch of blues
Once more I can see the sun a shining
Shining though I know I'm over you
So don't think it ain't been fun cause it ain't...
Don't think I don't love you cause I don't
ONCE A DAY

  ' Moss Rose Publications 
When I found somebody new I thought I never would
Forget you for I thought then I never could
But time has taken all the pains away
Until now I'm down to hurtin' once a day
Once a day all day long
And once a night from dusk till dawn
The only time I wish you weren't gone
Is once a day every day all day long
I'm so glad that I'm not like a guy I knew one time
He lost the one he loved then slowly lost his mind
He sat around and cried his life away
Lucky me I'm only crying once a day
Once a day all day long...
Once a day every day all day long

Life's supreme reward receive if you believe
If your life is not inspiring and your days are long and tiring
Rest receive when you believe
Nothing here below can measure up to heaven's lasting treasure
Be not deceived only believe
If you believe so will it be...

Well the two new people that's moved to the middle of the block
And we're at the top of the town and don't you think we're not
For we got love and happiness people envy us you see
For we found heaven right here on earth at at 
Yes we found what most people are looking for
And it's not a lotta money to spend on a real fine car
But it's so when and where a bird flies and sings so free
And there's whole lotta winds in this little house at 
The four thousandth block proves what true love can do
Once a lonely place but was sold to me and you
Oh all around the house you can see little children play
And they're not as a people's kids were proud to say
They are the symbol of our love for all the world to see
They're a part of heaven right here on earth at 
And our love's on the day you can see many people drive by
For look at the house they think they fell from the sky
They say that this place would make them as happy as you and me
And the whole town's tryin' to buy our house at 
The four thousandth block...
Oh all around the house you can see little children play...
We're not gonna sale our happy little house at

I DON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE

  ' Moss Rose Publications 
I don't love you anymore like the way I did before
And since you've found someone new I think it's best
I don't try and walk the floor I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less
I don't love you anymore for I've got no more love to give
You drained my heart of all its love with every sweet caress
I keep saying o'er and o'er I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less
I held you close to me one time I kissed your lips and called you mine
But another came and thrilled you more I guess
I cried as you walked out the door I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less
I don't love you anymore...
Trouble is I don't love you any less
LONELY KNOW MY SECRET

There's a secret behind the smile you see
For this smile is just a part of me
But I know some can't see the signs
That show I'm hurtin' all the time
And the lonely know my secret they know you're on my mind
There's a secret behind the lies you tell
For inside is where the sorrow lies
Cause I'm living like the lonely do
For they've lost someone they love too
And the lonely know my secret they know what I go through
There's a secret behind the smile you see...
Yes the lonely know my secret they know I still love you

Where every heart is aching just like mine
Well I've loved and I'd been loved but I had the reckless heart
And the many dreams I had are torn apart

Alone in a world of broken heart

We both have a morning cup of coffee
And with tender love you reach and touch my hand
And my son comes in and says good morning daddy
And I say how's daddy's little man
Then I woke up from dreaming I woke up from dreaming
I keep dreaming you're not gone but I'd found myself alone
When I woke up from dreaming
We're both making plans for the future
Of the joy that we want to give our son
We'd say almost enough to buy a new home
A home filled with love and fun
Then I woke up from dreaming...
Then I woke up from dreaming
OLD BRUSH ARBORS

  ' Glad Music 

I remember them so clearly mom and dad loved them so dearly
Old brush arbors by the side of the road
Where I learned about salvation from the book of revelations
In an arbor by the side of the road
Old brush arbors by the side of the road
Where a sinner could lay down his heavy load
It was in those old brush arbors troubled souls found peaceful harbors
Brush arbors by the side of the road
Many times I have departed from the way of life I started
In an arbor by the side of the road
But each time the devil's caught me I remembered what they taught me
In brush arbors by the side of the road
Old brush arbors by the side of the road
Where the mighty light of God's great mercy fload
There was prayin' shoutin' singin' till the country side was ringin'
Brush arbors by the side of the road
Old brush arbors by the of the road <start> Headed down life's crooked road lot of things I never knowed
And because of me not knowin' I now pine
Trouble got in the trail spent the next five years in jail
Should have read that detour sign
Detour there's a muddy road ahead detour paid no mind to what it said
Detour oh the bitter things I find should have read that detour sign
I got stuck in the mud all my hopes dropped with a thud
And I thought that my heart strings were made of twine
But the father I go the more sorrow I know should have read that detour sign
Detour there's a muddy road ahead
Should have read that detour sign should have read that detour sign <start> Don't encourage me
I'll do anything
I want to be loving
Who I want to be loving

Circumstances changing over
For the chosen few
I want to be loving

I'll say anything
It's almost impossible
To a stranger

Cryin' blues in motel rooms Lord the hard times weren't that hard
And some fell in and some fell out and some just fell apart
Drinkin' from the bottle and singin' from the heart
Harlan sang us Heartaches By The Number one more time
Johnny tell us how that woman helped you walk the line
Willie sing us Hello walls cause we all know our flaws
We've been drinkin' from the bottle and singin' from the heart
That blonde there sittin' on the floor my sad song made her cry
I think she caught my zipper bout the time I caught her eye
Well she can take my body home but who's gonna drive the car
We've been drinkin' from the bottle and singin' from the heart
Drinkin' from the bottle...

Now I sip my Chivits from a fancy crystal glass
A young ambitions eight piece pot band a pushin' at my ass
While we're singin' for the money I think back to the start
When we were drinkin' from the bottle and singin' from the heart
So let's start drinkin' from the bottle... <start> You say you're sorry once again dear
You want me to take you back once more
You say you need a helping hand dear
But that's what you told me once before
Walk softly on this heart of mine love
Don't treat it mean and so unkind
Let it rest in peace and quiet love
Walk softly on this heart of mine
I know you soon will find a new love
I feel your heart is turned to stone
But please let me down real easy
For loneliness moves in as you move on
Walk softly on this heart of mine love
Don't treat it mean and so unkind
Let it rest in peace and quiet love
Walk softly on this heart of mine <start> VERSE

Free as eagles up high

Repeat x <start> I've been out here seven dances in a row
Yeah the band's so hot they won't play nothin' slow
Stetsons and Wrangler jeans are floodin' through the door
And it's sink or swim as soon as you hit the floor
Chorus
I'm dancin' in a sea of cowboy hats
Shoulder to shoulder and back to back
Two steppin' fools as far as the eye can see
They're ridin' the wave on that sawdust floor
Rockin' the boat from shore to shore
So jump right in cause this is where it's at in the sea of cowboy hats
Feel free to scrape your boots til they've worn holes
You won't get too far in here with rubber soles
Yeah the place is packed and we're puttin' on a show
In over our heads and caught up in the flow
ChorusRepeat x <start> When Mama Cried

I was standing in the hall when they called the doctor in
Almost scared me half to death
When they said It's a boy again
I walked in just in time to see them lay him by her side
And when she looked into my newborn brother's eyes
Mama cried
When I was just a teenage boy a preacher man stopped by
He asked me if I knew the Lord
Said If you don't then tell me why
I gave my heart to God that day and then I was baptized
And when I stood up at church to testify
Oh Mama cried
Chorus
When Mama cried
You could feel the love she felt down deep inside
Through the good times and the bad times of my life
Oh you could see the love she had in her eyes
When Mama cried
T.H.S. graduation day in 
Standing in the high school gym decorated blue and white
And when they called my name out loud
You'd thought someone had died
'Cause when we sang the Alma Mater one last time
Oh Mama cried
Dressed up in our Sunday best the family gathered 'round
Me and brother standing there with our heads bowed down
Flowers on the alter and a lady dressed in white
And when the preacher said Son you can kiss your bride
Sweet Mama cried
Chorus
When Mama cried
You could feel the love she felt down deep inside
Through the good times and the bad times of my life
Oh you could see the love she had in her eyes
When Mama cried
When Mama cried <start> It's that feeling that someone is standing behind me
then I turn around and there's no one there.
And it's the sensation that someone just whispered
yeah I still hear your voice but you're not really here.
Your memory's like a ghost
and my heart is its host.
I can still feel you just as close as skin every now and then.
All by myself in a crowded room on my empty bed.
There's a place you've touched with your love no one gets close to
I can still feel you I can still feel you I can still feel you.
I can still feel you
you said you'd love me forever then you said 'It's over
and left me without the missing link.
Well I thought I'd forget you but I guess I forgot to
and lately I've been too confused to think.
When I reach for someone new it's like I'm touching you.
I can still feel you just as close as skin every now and then.
All by myself in a crowded room on my empty bed.
There's a place you've touched with your love no one gets close to
I can still feel you I can still feel you I can still feel you.
I can still feel you
In everything that moves
in everything I do
I can still feel you just as close as skin every now and then.
All by myself in a crowded room on my empty bed.
There's a place you've touched with your love no one gets close to
I can still feel you I can still feel you I can still feel you.
I can still feel you <start> Well I've been wonderin' what I've been missin' I guess I should have known
But my heart does and it ain't whisperin' it tells me just what it wants
Someone who knows what I like in my coffee
And the shape of my ol' hat
A lover who always looks at me not through me
I need a love like that
Chorus
I need a love like that
I could use a little sun on my back
A truck needs a highway a train needs a track
I need a love like that
Well I need a new car but I can't afford it
So I keep patchin' that ol' flat
My heart's lonely and I can't ignore it
I need a love like that
Chorus
Yeah I need a love like that
I could use a little sun on my back
A truck needs a highway a train needs a track
I need a love like that
Two young people dancin' in the daylight
They don't care where they're at
Waitin' sunset holdin' on so tight
I need a love like that
Chorus
One little baby hidin in the shadow
Of her daddy's hat
Lovin' and trustin' blindly she'll follow
I need a love like that
Chorus
Yeah a truck needs a highway a train needs a track
And I need a love like that <start> We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I'm saying
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
We can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds
So if an old friend I know
Drops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes
Here we go again
Asking where I've been
Can't you see these tears are real
I'm crying
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
We can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds
Oh let our love survive
I'll dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
Honey you know
I've never lied to you
No never lie to you yeah
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I'm saying
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby <start> The orchid is a flower that blooms so tenderly
To thrill the fairest lady of the land
If placed beside a blushing rose the rose cannot compare
But how was such as I to understand
I overlooked an orchid while searching for a rose
The orchid that I overlooked was you
The rose that I was searching for has proved to be untrue
The orchid now I find my dear was you
 steel 
The rose has lost its color but the orchid is the same
And I'm alone to face these lonely years
I didn't see the orchid I was looking for a rose
And now I pay the price with bitter tears
Cause I overlooked an orchid... <start> There's more pretty girls than one
More pretty girls then one
Every old town that I rambled around
And there's more pretty girls than one
Mama talked to me last night
She gave me some good advise
She said Son you'd better quit this old ramblin' all around
And mary you a sweet little wife

Honey look down that old lonesome road
Hang down your pretty head and cry
'cause I'm thinking all about them pretty little gals
And ahopin' that I never die
There's more pretty girls than one
There's more pretty girls then one
Every old town that I rambled around
And there's more pretty girls than one
 <start> Now when I was young my
Momma read me nursery rhymes beside my bed
Though they sounded mighty fine they made no sense to me
Now that I am all grown up it seems my nights have changed such
So I went out and made me up a nursery rhyme for me
Chorus
It goes bar light bar bright
First bar that I see tonight
Wish I may wish I might
Find someone to hold me tight
Hey diddle diddle a man with a fiddle and the
Girls sings along with the tune
Just a one more dance til you turn off the lights and
You can shut down this saloon
Well I never understood
How a big ole gal could raise no kids in a shoe
And any old jack that goes jumping a candle
Needs to find something better to do
Rub a dub dub  men in a tub sure sounds kinda funny to me
So I made up a honky tonk nursery rhyme
And it's the only one I'll sing
Chorus <start> I'm fallin' head over heels for him
He's callin' me twice a night then callin' again
When I talk he likes to listen
He says I'm the one he's been missin'
Somebody tell me he isn't
Chorus
Just another heartache
Just another heartache
Another bad lie another goodbye
Lookin' for another heart to break
Maybe I'm too cautious for my own good
Maybe he's the real deal knock on wood
All I know is he'll be here in a minute
I hope it's love and I hope he's in it
I'll be over my limit with
Chorus
This better be somethin' more
I want to be sure that I'm not fallin'
I'm not fallin' for
Just another heartache
Just another heartache
Another bad lie another goodbye lookin' for a
Just another heartache
Just another heartache
Another bad lie another goodbye lookin' for another heart
Another bad lie another goodbye lookin' for another

The last guy to steal a kiss on the front porch.
But this time its gunna be different
This time im gunna walk right up take your hand and tell you how I feel

Say something tonight that might scare you away.
cause Ive been known to stumble
And if you see me fall flat on my face
Its cause you take my breath away.
Ohh and if Im gunna take that chance tonight
Ohh I just wanna do it right.
Usually I watch you leave with your girlfriends.
Sit right here and drink my beer all alone again.
But this time its all about saying everything I never used to say
This time Im not gunna let you walk away.
I just wanna do it right
cause I dont wanna lose ya.
Say something tonight that might scare you away.

And if you see me fall flat on my face
Its cause you take my breath away.
Ohh and if Im gunna take that chance tonight

And if you see me fall flat on my face
Its cause you take my breath away.
Ohh and if Im gunna take that chance tonight
Ohh I just wanna do it right <start> Just follow the stairway to this lonely world of mine
You'll find me waiting here in Apartment No 
Not so very long ago you walked away from me
And after all the plans we made you decided to be free
Loneliness surrounds me without your arms around me
And the sun will never shine in Apartment No 
 piano  steel 
I'll keep waiting in this lonely room just in case you change your mind
You'll find me waiting here in apartment No 
Loneliness surrounds me...
And the sun will never shine in Apartment No  <start> It was running through my mind I was running out of time
And it was time to let you go
No more right or wrong no more crying all night long
Even though it's lonely here alone
When the phone rings I almost wish that it was you
There's nothing left to say and nothing we can do
I can stand on my own two feet
And I know that this is best for you and me
Believe me it's not easy I can feel the pain
It hurts so much to leave but not enough to stay
You've convinced me before to come back for more
Well this time I'm not turning around
I'm sure one more try is bound to end in goodbye
And I've come too far to turn back now
I know the hardest part is over and I take a breath
Now we can look forward to better days ahead
Oh I can stand on my own two feet
And I know that this is best for you and me
Believe me it's not easy I can feel the pain
It hurts so much to leave but not enough to stay <start> Watch that man get up and go to work every day
And watch that woman send their little girl outside to play
And watch and you might see the milkman drive up to the door
While the baby plays with her old ragged doll and sings these words once more
Baby loves her dolly true but who in the world who loves who
And as she combs her dolly's curles sings who loves who in this whole world
Who loves who in this old world
Watch that man come home from work which scared hand's so sore
Watch his woman never look as he comes through the door
And watch that little girl try to climb upon her daddy's knee
As he coldly pushes her away and turns to his tea
Watch that little girl go to bed and slowly search for sleep
Watch her watch her bedroom door but no one comes to peep
And as she listens to the lonely restless dreamless night
She thinks of her tomorrow and holds her dolly tight
Baby loves her dolly true... <start> You never send me flowers or ever buy me candy
You never bring me pretty things when you come to see me
And you forgot my birthday oh I wish you could see
How I miss the little things that you don't do for me
You never say that I look nice or that you're proud of me
You overlook the little things that you should see
These little things are big enough to hurt but too small to make me want to leave
But I do miss the little things that you don't do for me
Now how can I miss flowers that never reached my door
How can I taste candy that's still at the candy store
These little things mean a lot to me to you they may be silly
But I do miss the little things that you don't do for me
Yes I miss the little things that you don't do for me <start> No one could hold me no one could control me but now my future is up to you
Your lovin' can shape me make me or break me
Oh I hope you're feelin' me like I'm feelin' you
This feeling is crazy and only you can save me
From this love thing that I've got for you
Your love is a potion Lord and I need a notion
Oh I hope you're feelin' me like I'm feelin' you
'Cause these changes got me goin' in circle
First I turn away then turn right back to you
Well I need your lovin' to keep me from sinkin'
Oh I hope you're feelin' me like I'm feelin' you
Want to win when I gamble no need to ramble I doubled my lovin' when I gave it to you
I gotta do it with you I can't do it without you
Oh I hope you're feelin' me like I'm feelin' you
'Cause these changes got me... <start> His eyes could melt her soul
He's makin' all his moves just right
His smile has her longin' for
His touch tonight
Does he want someone to love
Is this a game she's played before
She's heard her share of bedtime tales
This time she's wantin' more
Should she take a chance
Could this be romance
Is it fate or midnight fantasy
He would take her home
But should she leave alone
'Cause she don't want to be
Just another bedtime story
Her face has filled his dreams
Now he's a prisoner of her charms
And he'd give anything he's got
To hold her in his arms
As they dance around the floor
He keeps looking for a sign
If he tells her what is in his heart
Would she think it's just a lie
Should he take a chance
Could this be romance
Is it fate or midnight fantasy
He would take her home
But should he leave alone
'Cause he don't want to be
Just another bedtime story
She could be his Cinderella
He could be her Prince Charming
Sometimes even fairy tales come true
Should they take a chance
Could this be romance
Is it fate or midnight fantasy
Should he take her home
Should they leave alone
'Cause they don't want to be
Just another bedtime story <start> When I was but a youngster Christmas meant one thing
That I'd be getting lots of toys that day
I learned a whole lot different when mother set me down
And taught me to spell Christmas this way
C is for the Christ Child born upon this day
H is for Herald Angels in the night
R means our redeemer I means Israel
S is for the star that shone so bright
T is for three wise men they who travelled far
M is for the manger where he lay
A's for all he stands for S means shepherds came
And that's why there's a Christmas Day
And that's why there's a Christmas Day <start> If I'm a fallen angel you can't blame me for it all
If I'm a fallen angel you're the one who made me fall
Another fallen angel that's what you call me now
Because you see me out each night breaking every vow
You took my love for granted you're lonely constantly
And that's the only way that I can hide mysery
If I'm a fallen angel...
 guitar 
So many times I told you I couldn't take much more
Do you remember how you laughed and walked right out the door
The only way that I can stop my tears before they start
Is go the way of other girls who have a broken heart
If I'm a fallen angel... <start> Well I said if you're happy that I'm glad
At times for all the fun that we've had
I said if it's over I hope that you walk through fields of clover
But that's a lie I hope you're sad
Well I said I wish all the best to you
And good luck to your someone new
I said if it's true love then go ahead and take all my best with you love
But that's a lie I hope you're blue
If I'm not careful you'll catch me in a lie
And all I have to do is look at you and you'll see a grown man cry
I said I would never let you know how much it hurts to let you go
I said I won't miss you and I'll forget how it was to kiss you
But that's a lie look at me cry but that's a lie I need you so <start> Ridin 'round the county drinkin from a jar. Big blue canoe up on top of the car. Hop in darlin' don't be a stranger. Sit back and relax cause you ain't in no danger.
Well Bogalusa spells trouble to me I'd rather stay out here under the trees. With the wind on the lake the stars in the sky what else do you need to make you feel high
Chorus I want to ride with you in my blue canoe. Baby lets go ridin. slippin and a sliding. In my blue canoe.
You bring the ice chest and I'll get the bait. Meet me at the lake and don't be late. Cause all this hangin around is draggin me down. I gotta get behind the wheel and get the hell out of town. Too many people too many cars to many nights in too many bars. My noggin's gettin' soggy and my spirit's are saggin. Time to take a ride in my blue water wagon. <start> Walls of Jericho
Adrieenne Young
Lookin much older
With dust on your shoulder
Well you crashed in this mornin
Wearin only your pride
Highways and freight trains
Drivers with no names
Well you played such a god game it was easy to ride
With a Poor Mans scheme and
Rich Mans dream
You ran for your life
Over El Rio into Laredo it was do or die
The stars hung bright on the other side
Well I offered a cold beer
And I said you could stay here
I swallowed my own fear
'cause I knew what was right
We spoke in a language that was
Here before Cambridge
Colored bright terracotta and aquamarine
With a Poor Boys Dream and a
Rich mans scheme
You sacrificed the warmth of your wifes hand
Your children and homeland for a roll lof dice
A bitter slice of American Pie
Mighty walls of Jericho
Toppled by the sound of tiny feet
Trumpets sound and we will know
Just whos sitting in the drivers seat
Oh these walls are comin down
Getting back to the ground
And therell be victory
In the sound of their defeat
Well you slept when the dawn came
So I undid the latch chain I walked
Down to the riverbank and thought about life
Just when did this happen
Was it always the fashion
Playin just to win disregarding the price
Such a Rich Mans scheme using
Poor Boys dreams
To fight the fight
How far will we go pretending we dont know what is wrong or right
The stars hang bright on the other side
Mighty walls of Jericho
Toppled by the sound of tiny feet
Trumpets sound and we will know
Just whos sitting in the drivers seat
Oh these walls are comin down
Getting back to the ground
And therell be victory
In the sound of their defeat <start> I'm waiting for ships that never come in just watching and waiting in vain
It seems that life's stormy sea holds nothing for me
But broken dreams and shattered schemes
With each new day's dawning I try to pretend one more tomorrow and waiting will end
I'm waiting for ships that never come in I wonder where they can be
Now life is only a game of poker and happiness is the pot
They'd deal you five cards in the cradle and you play with your like it or not
Some game had a start with and the game doesn't seem on the square
When you pick up your cards and discover that you were born without even a pair
Now some take a chance on bluffing and stake everything they've got
On a little yankee poor flush and sometimes that wins a plot
While others will break up openers to draw for a middle straight
Why they know the chance they are taking but they learned your mistake too late
Now some can't plan crook it against all good advice
But they seldom get away with it at the end they've paid the price
Now me I've always been a loser why it seems I never can win
I'm just a dreamer who's waiting for ships that never come in
I'm waiting for ships that never come in I wonder where they can be <start> no masters no more in the world we implore
the state of our age shall be thrown to the shore
if not for the colors that glow 'neath the sun
no beauty for anyone
no detail on time on the throwaway line
now brawn is the victor the loser the mind
if not for the ruins if what was once now
no beauty for anyone
gone is the ache and the wail
gone is the words for to tell
gone is the hunger that gnaws at the bone
gone is the tale of our years
gone is the blood and the tears
gone is all but a quarry of stone
no rest ever earned creativity turned
of the nature from which it incessantly churned
if not for a morning that surely will come
no beauty for anyone <start> Writers Doug Supernaw Tammy Pierce
I've had one too many as if you couldn't tell
And I called you from the bottom of my sinking spell
I know we agreed that it'd be eaiser on me not to talk to you
Or see you until I get over you
But my heart has left me no choice
So excuse me but I've just gotta hear your voice
'cause I'm having one of those days
When your memory won't go away
Tomorrow I'll be okay
But I'm just having one one of those days
I'm getting by one day at a time
It's not nearly as often that you cross my mind
But early this morning felt it coming over me
Tried to fight it back can't hold it back
Can't help it that this call's in vain
Ah but it's not a storm you know it's just a little rain
I'm just having one of those days
When your memory won't go away
Tomorrow I'll be okay
But I'm just having one one of those days
Yes I'm just having one one of those days <start> Guess it's time for me to say just how it is that I feel today
Today is just like any other day cause you've been on my mind
It really hasn't been that long but it's funny where the time has flown
Old memories just keep holding on and you been on my mind
You been on my mind sometimes
I think I must be going blind
I've seen a world baby without you
But I don't see myself there too
Hardly does a day go by when I don't see your clear blue eyes
Many night I just wonder why and you been on my mind
You've been on my mind so long
I've been thinking that something was wrong
I've told myself I should forget
But I don't seem to have it yet
I don't dream that you might change I don't think that I'm acting strange
I tell myself it's all in vain and you been on my mind
You've been on my mind I've said
Till it's all that's in my head
Yes I know what I must do
But I don't think you'll be there too
Guess it's time for me to go but as it is I'll never know
Just what it is that I long for so And you been on my mind
You been on my mind <start> I'm waiting tonight for you to tell me
Do you still love me and will you remain
My heart is breakin' with each passing hour
Please don't let me love you in vain
I used to think your love would always save me
And that you'd always stay right by my side
But I can see a change comin' over you
And the tears I cry just can't hide
No I'm waiting tonight for you to tell me
Do you still love me and will you remain
My heart is breakin' with each passing hour
Please don't let me love you in vain
I can't pretend that love is just a pastime
And that you never meant a thing to me
So darlin please don't leave me all alone
Surrounded by your memory
I'm waiting tonight for you to tell me
Do you still love me and will you remain
My heart is breakin' with each passing hour
Please don't let me love you in vain
So please don't let me love you in vain <start> If you really love me show me that you love me
If you really love me make me know you care
You can't wrap it up put it in a box so measured by the rule of a broken heart
Love's not put in your heart to stay love's not love till you give it away give it away
Make me feel warm when you hold me make me feel loved when you kiss me
You'll send me to heaven if you'll love me then I'll know you care
You can't wrap it up
You'll send me to heaven if you'll love me then I'll know you care
You'll send me to heaven if you'll love me then I'll know you care <start> This is how I learned it from a TimeLife Album in about .
There's a little rosewood casket
Lying on a marble stand
And a packet of old love letters
Written by my true love's hand
Go and bring them to me sister
Read them o'er for me tonight
I have often tried but I could not
For the tears that filled my eyes I did not know this verseThanks
Last Sunday I saw him walkin'
With a lady by his side
And I thought I heard him tell her
He would never be his bride.
When I'm dead and in my coffin
And my shroud's around me bound
And my narrow grave is ready
In some lonely churchyard ground.
Take his letters and his locket
Place together o'are my heart
But the golden ring he gave me
From my finger never part <start> Now the road is rocky but it won't be rocky long
Now the road is rocky but it won't be rocky long
Another man has got my woman and gone
I've got those blues
I'm wearing out the soles of my shoes
I've got those blues
I'm wearing out the soles of my shoes
My gal went away and left me
She left me with the dog gone blues
You'll never miss your water til the well runs dry
You'll never miss your water til the well runs dry
You'll never miss your woman
Until she says goodbye
I wish to the Lord you'd bring my woman back home
I wish to the Lord you'd bring my woman back home
I'm not so lonesome just don't want to be alone <start> I left Ireland and crossed the Atlantic
At home once more there was no work to find.
With a heavy heart I had to make that journey
With thoughts of friends and loved ones on my mind.
I landed in New York then traveled southwards
'Cause city life was never meant for me.
I think it must've been God's plan to lead me
To a little town called Erin Tennessee
There I felt I was back in my homeland
Far across the sea
Oh I found a little bit of Ireland
Way down in Tennessee
Now very soon I met a pretty lady
She set my heart a whirlin' all could see
I wanted her to be my one and only
My southern belle from Erin Tennessee
As we walked the hills I told her of my homeland
Far across the sea
I found love in that little bit of Ireland
Called Erin Tennessee
We settled on green rollin pastures
It was there that she took my hand
And we lived and we loved and we raised our children
Far away from my own native land
Now I often tell them of my homeland
Far across the sea
But we have a little bit of Ireland
Here in Erin Tennessee
Yes we have a little bit of Ireland
Here in Erin Tenneseee <start> Jesus touch my sinful soul and let my cry for peace come to a hush
Let my footsteps follow Thee and help me walk across the bridge of love
Over the river of life's intentions
Across the bridge of love to the arms of my salvation
Jesus give me strength enough for me to walk across the bridge of love
Over the river of life's intentions
Across the bridge of love
Help me to walk across the bridge of love <start> I had drifted for so long with my life so full of wrong
That the Lord should have turned his back on me
But he took the trembling hand of a lost and lonely man
Broke the chains from mortal shame and made me free
Yes he took away the sin from my soul where it had been
And he helped my blinding eyes again to see
Yes and now I understand the beauty of salvation's plan
Out on the cross you paid the cost and made me free
I had sunk so deep in shame never calling on his name
All the joys of life had turned to misery
But then he gave me back control of my lost and wandering soul
Removed the fears dried my tears and made me free
Yes he took away the sin that had stained me deep within
And he gave me back the fate that I might see
Now I'm so glad I understand the promise of salvation's plan
Out on the cross you paid the cost and made me free <start> Sittin' in an all nite cafe in a booth back in the corner
Making paper wads from napkins throwing toothpicks on the floor
Got a problem I can't solve it gonna sit here till I figure out
The reason why my baby doesn't love me anymore
Well it can't be another woman cause I never looked at any one
Not since I've been knowing her and that's a long long time
Drank so many cups of coffee bet you that I'll get an ulcer
Sittin' in this all nite cafe with my baby on my mind
 steel 
Sittin' in an all nite cafe listening to the jukebox playing
Overhead the waitress saying I wonder why he don't go home
Guess my baby's out with someone laughing dancing and romancing
And I'll bet she never thinks about me sittin' here alone
Well it can't be another woman...
Sittin' in this all nite cafe with my baby on my mind <start> You left me I left too
I went right out of my head
The old boy they all knew
They all knew was pretty much dead
You know they say I went crazy
And by crazy I mean mentally insane
I had a world where I still had you
Oh I wish I was crazy again
Crazy again crazy in love
Ignorantly bliss baby
That's what dreams are made of
There was no hurtin'
I lived life without pain
You'd still be in my arms baby
If I was crazy again
I guess what I miss is
The not missin' you most
That feeling on oneness
That every one of us should know
When the hours were ours
And I sit talkin' to the wind
And your soul danced with my soul
Oh I wish I was crazy again
Crazy again crazy in love
Ignorantly bliss baby
That's what dreams are made of
There was no hurtin'
I lived life without pain
You'd still be in my arms baby
If I was crazy again <start> MY BODY'S AT HOME

RECORDED BY DAVE DUDLEY
I'm sittin' back easy in my easy chair
Watchin' the morning dawnin' fair
My wife's cookin' breakfast and my little girl
Is looking at her daddy like he owns the world
I've got everything that a man could want
My lips oughta smile but somehow they don't
I feel a guilty lamp in my throat
My body's at home but my heart's on the road
Alberquerque and New Orleans hamburgers and pinto beans
Big mountains and river beds happy anywhere I lay my head
I feel like I'm about to explode
My body's at home but my heart's on the road
I love my family and I always will
But I'm just no good when I'm sittin' still
A quiet kind of love and me don't mix
And you can't teach an old dog new tricks
So kiss me baby and hold me tight
I'll try to get back by Saturday night
I don't mean to hurt you Lord knows I don't
But my body's at home but my heart's on the road
Alberquerque and New Orleans...
Alberquerque and New Orleans... <start> We didn't care if people stared
We'd make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebody'd tell us to get a room
It's hard to believe that was me and you
Now we keep saying that we're OK
But I don't want to settle for good not great
I miss the way that it felt back then
I wanna feel that way again
Been so long that you'd forget
The way I used to kiss your neck
Remind me remind me
So on fire so in love
Way back when we couldn't get enough
Remind me remind me
Remember the airport dropping me off
We were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop
I felt bad cause you missed your flight
But that meant we had one more night
Do you remember how it used to be
We'd turn out the lights and didn't just sleep
Remind me baby remind me
Oh so on fire so in love
That look in your eyes that I miss so much
Remind me baby remind me
I wanna feel that way
Yeah I wanna hold you close
Oh if you still love me
Don't just assume I know
Oh baby remind me remind me
Do you remember the way it felt
You mean back when we couldn't control ourselves
Remind me yeah remind me
All those things that you used to do
That made me fall in love with you
Remind me oh baby remind me
Yeah you'd wake up in my old tshirt
All those mornings I was late for work
Remind me oh baby remind me yeah
Oh baby remind me baby remind me
Yeah you'd wake up in my old tshirt
Oh baby remind me <start> I'm not Lisa my name is Julie
An' Lisa left you years ago
My eyes are not blue but mine won't leave you
'Til the sunlight has touched your face
She was your morning light
Her smile told of no night
An' your love for her grew
With each rising sun
And then one winter day his hand led hers away
An' she left you here drowning in your tears
Here where you've stayed for years
Cryin' Lisa Lisa
I'm not Lisa an' my name is Julie
An' Lisa left you years ago
An' my eyes are not blue but mine won't leave you
'Til the sunlight shines through your face <start> Parody of Mama DOn't Get Dressed Up For Nothing by Brooks  Dunn 
She said a hey plow boy done ate half a cow
And I still can hear your big old belly growl
So I steamed up a fresh heap of broccoli for you
You've got calories to burn and some pounds to lose
Well you can bring that broccoli with squirrel and dumplings
Cause Cledus don't stop eatin' for nuthin'
She said I've cooked nonstop in this house for weeks
Time to get your big butt up on somewhere's else to eat
So I've been down to Shoney's four times today
I hit the Sizzler and the Quincy's they were on the way
I 'bout blowed out my colon from buffet jumpin
Cause Cledus don't stop aeatin' for nuthin'
If you like love handles and big old buns
I've pounds of passion and tons of fun
I look like Flabio in my kingcab truck
To look like Brooks and Dunn I need a tummy tuck
YUUUUUCK
We got to find a little place where I can eat some more
Before I start rollin' on this hardwood floor
Heck down to Hooters break out the wings
Then make a run down to the border I'm an eatin' machine
Fire up the stove and keep the fat clams comin
Cause Cledus don't stop eatin for nuthin'
If it's all you can eat then you'll see me runnin
Cause Cledus don't stop eatin for nuthin'
Tell Richard Simmons he can kiss my 
Cause Cledus don't stop eatin for nuthin'
Make my pies pumpkin
And my donuts Dunkin

WRITER BEN PETERS
I was blue till I found you I didn't know where the road of life was leadin' me to
I'm on my own I walk alone it seems like Lonely Street would be my permanent home
But baby now I'm walkin' down Happy Street smilin' at everyone that I meet
Ain't it funny what fallin' in love can do oh honey
Now I'm walkin' down Happy Street I never thought life could be so sweet
Now I'm walkin' down Happy Street with you
Same old place same human race
But now it seems like the world's put on a happier face
Since you are mine each day I find
It's filled with sunshine and your love is makin' it shine
And baby now I'm walkin' down Happy Street smilin' at everyone that I meet
Ain't it funny what fallin' in love can do oh honey
Now I'm walkin' down Happy Street I never thought life could be so sweet
But anyplace is Happy Street with you <start> Such a feelin's comin' over me
There is wonder in most everything I see
Not a cloud in the sky
Got the sun in my eyes
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream
Everything I want the world to be
Is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear
It's because you are here
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen
I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world
Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's tellin' me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me
There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here
I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world <start> Verse
It's hard describing a heartache because its a one of a kind thing
a erious injury and a whole lot of endless pain
if it was a storm i'd compare it to a hurricane
awe its even got a name
Chorus
If it was a drink it would be a strong one
if it was a sad song it would be long one
If it was a color it would be deep deep blue
But if we're talking about heartache it would be you
Verse 
If it was a full moon it would be a total eclipse
if it was a tidal wave it would sink a thousand ships
if it was a blizzard it would be record breaking cold
if it was a lie it would be the greatest story told
Chorus
If it was a drink it would be a strong one
if it was a sad song it would be long one
If it was a color it would be deep deep blue
But if we're talking about heartache it would be you <start> I've been here a month or more stuck in this old city.
The people that have to call it home they're the ones I pity
Lord I'm homesick and the blues are the only songs I ever seem to pick.
I get out and walk the street 'til I get blisters on my feet
I'm southbound.

 guitar
I'm all right 'til late at night I'm sitting by my window
Counting sheep but I couldn't sleep for listening to that train blow
I begin to pine when I hear that big old engine rolling down the line
I'm going back to spend some time where I can have fun if I ain't got a dime
I'm southbound.
 guitar <start> Fool fool heart what have you done
I thought by now you'd had enough but
Oh no you've got me falling in love again
Fool fool heart guess you'll never learn
Taking chances like you do isn't smart
My fool fool heart
Fool fool heart how quickly you forget
Just when you were about to mend
You get to feeling lucky so you try it again
You're a fool fool heart think you're bound to get it right
And that love's just a puzzle with a missing part
But you're a fool fool heart
Fool heart God only knows
How you make it through the highs and the lows
Fool heart I wouldn't mind if I thought it would be the last time
Fool fool heart you know
We've been through this before
Seems like you said you'd given up
That you were through with being lost in love
My fool fool heart guess you've got to play love's game
Still the losing is the hardest part my fool fool heart
Still the losing is the hardest part my fool fool heart <start> Small talk cheap beer and wine
Easy women wasted time
Another night with somebody he don't know
It's been the first and been the last
Got no future had no past
A nameless face in somebody else's show
Riding the rodeo
He's a rodeo rider sole survivor
Got to prove that he's the best
Rodeo rider sole survivor
Got to be the fastest in the west
Cheyenne to San Antoine
Wild horses and women he's known
Have broken his heart and most of his bones
But today he's gonna ride again
Doin' everything he can to win
A nameless face but that's the only life that he's ever known
Riding the rodeo
He's a rodeo rider sole survivor
Got to prove that he's the best
Rodeo rider sole survivor
Got to be the fastest in the west
He's a rodeo rider sole survivor
Got to prove that he's the best
Rodeo rider sole survivor
Got to be the fastest in the west <start> Were you there when they crucified my Lord

Were you there when they crucified my Lord
Were you there when they nailed Him to the Cross

Oh
Sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble tremble
Were you there when they nailed Him to the Cross
Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb
Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb
Oh

How to make a million the easy way
Fortyfive is the new eighteen
Read all about it in a magazine
Who's on pillswho's on booze
See who's running around on who
A picture they don't want you to see
Got it right here in a magazine
Forget everything you think you know
You don't need a mind of your own
They're gonna tell you everything you need
In the pages of a magazine
How to get a man with just one kiss
How to get a body that looks like this
Get new results with an old routine
They'll show you how in a magazine
Forget everything you think you know
You don't need a mind of your own
They're gonna tell you everything you need
In the pages of a magazine
If they put it on paper it must be true
Surely these people wouldn't lie to you
Go on believe everything you read
Everything you read in a magazine

Searching for shadows in the valleys
You were my Heaven you were my home
So what am I supposed to do when Heaven is gone
If the devil don't want me
Where the hell do I go
If I can't see the light
In the neon glow
If there ain't enough whiskey
To kill the fire in my soul
If the devil don't want me
Where the hell do I go
I've heard stories 'bout honky tonk angels
Picking up pieces of broken strangers
I'm at rock bottom with a smoke and a sin
When the party is over then I'm lonely again
If the devil don't want me
Where the hell do I go
If I can't see the light
In the neon glow
If there ain't enough whiskey
To kill the fire in my soul
If the devil don't want me
Where the hell do I go
No there ain't enough whiskey
To kill the fire in my soul
If the devil don't want me
Where the hell do I go <start> I never believed the woman like you existed
Somewhere along the way my mind got twisted
But you brought hope and understanding gave sweet love without demanding
How could I ever dream the more than this
Let's build a world together just for two
Let's put our dreams together and watch them all come true
Let's leave the world of tears and heartaches far behind
Let's build a world together yours and mine
We fill our world with music and children's laughter
And cherrish every hour we spend together
And every night we rediscover just how much we love each other
And dream about the things we'll do tomorrow
Let's build a world together...
Let's build a world together yours and mine <start> You make my eyes run over all the time
You're happy when I'm out of my mind
You don't love me but you won't let me be
Don't you ever get tired of hurting me
You must think I look bad with a smile
For you haven't let me wear one
In such a long long while
Still I keep coming back why must this be
Don't you ever get tired of hurting me
Someone must have hurt you long ago
But why take revenge on one who loves you so
You don't need me but you won't let me be
Don't you ever get tired of hurting me
Don't you ever get tired of hurting me <start> Wear away wear away I'm so afraid that time may wear away your love someday
If water can wear away the hardest rock if  can wear away the strongest lock
Then I can't help but wonder could it ever be
That time could wear away your love from me
Wear away wear away I'm so afraid that time may wear away your love someday
Now our love is as solid as the hardest rock
And our hearts bound together with the strongest lock
And still I can't help but wonder could it ever be
That time could wear away your love from me
Wear away wear away I'm so afraid that time may wear away your love someday <start> Well we've had our troubles we've had our hard times
Were some might have stumbled we've always survived
Sometimes love weakens when the chips are all down
But what we've got together gets stronger somehow

Pressure makes Diamonds much harder than stone
And they only get finer as each day goes on
We've been through some bad times but we made it somehow
'cause if pressure makes diamonds our love's a diamond by now
Well we know the feelin' when the world closes in
We've been there before love and we might go again
The road may get rocky life may get hard
But the whole world together can't tear us apart
 <start> Your Smile
Will always be one of my favorite things
Like backyard Barbeques and front porch swings an evenin breeze through a window screen
Your smile
Makes me feel just like a child inside
Like christmas morning sparkling red and bright grandads pipe my first bike
Your Smile
Like sunlight dripping through the trees
Like a wheat field whispering in the breeze
Like a sweet sweet melody that sets me free
Your Smile
So much joy from such a simple thing
Like an old wheel barrow filled with summer rain soft warm cake and a blue skied day
Your smile
Your Smile
Like sunlight dripping through the trees
Like a wheat field whispering in the breeze
Like a sweet sweet melody that sets me free <start> Troubles and a worried mind it seems that's all I've ever known
But now I'll leave it all behind if you'll just leave me alone
And if I go on loving you if to leave is a mistake
If I'm wrong in what I do that's the chance I'll have to take

I've heard it all a hundred times but I won't listen anymore

The young cowboys were laughin' at him and at the out of date clothes that he wore
Though his trophy buckle was old it told of the glory he surely had seen
And the beard that showed neath his old John B was wirey silver sheen
With a plug in his lip from his back pocket rip and his faded old denim jeans blue
Where a halo show white like a moon in the night
Was a hole where his snoozed worn through
He spat in the dust and he bitterly cussed as the bull tried to tear down the chute
Then he looked up at me with a gleam in his eye
And he placed his old hand on my boot
He said you'll ride this old bull on your worst ever day
With your hind leg chained to a tree
As I am made ready to concur the brute here's an old song my old man sang to me
Go ridin' young cowboy go winnin' and goin' out boy
Don't let him put you on the ground
Go spur him young cowboy de fur him riding out boy
Show 'em that your Oklahoma bound
Well I marked eighty points and I won me the round
The fans in the stands went plum wild
Well I could see my old daddy just a dancin' a jig
Well I looked up to the Lord and I smiled
I said thanks for my good arm and thanks for my luck
And thanks that I'm still fit and young
But thanks most of all for them old bulls that buck
For my dad and the song that he sung
Go ridin' young cowboy...
Well I've been down the road many miles since that day
Things ain't changed much since I've begun
I still think of my dad when I'm ropin' one up and I sing his song to my son
Go ridin' young cowboy...
Go ridin' young cowboy... <start> A pinelog shack a mile off the state road
Daddy took odd jobs momma raised us three
Times were mean and our home was a haven
It was all we had in Coldwater Tennessee
Tougher than hell daddy sang like an angel
The rhythm of the mountains seemed to set him free
One night he ran headed north with his martin
And everything we'd saved in Coldwater Tennessee
Rusted dreams turn gold in Nashville
The stars ride high and the satellites beam
Pretty love songs voices you remember
All the way on down to Coldwater Tennessee
The headline says local man hits big time
Just look at those clothes and his brandnew family
Lyin' in bed just starin' at his picture
The favorite son of Coldwater Tennessee
A teenage kid on a oneway ticket
Yeah tonight he's bound for the Opry
By the backstage door he'll wait in the darkness
Like he did so long in Coldwater Tennessee
The crowd draws close the door swings open
Cameras flash and the pretty girls scream
Then a burst of fire and a shout from the shadows
This is from your fans in Coldwater Tennessee
Rusted dreams turn gold in Nashville
The stars ride high for a while it seems
But tomorrow at dawn there'll be one star fallen
He'll be coming back down to Coldwater Tennessee
Yes they'll bury him there in Coldwater Tennessee <start> I'm goin' to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come

On this old road travelin' night and day
I'm goin' to Kansas City Casey's callin' me
I got a friend in Denver he wanted me to stay awhile
Got a friend in Denver he wanted me to stay awhile
But I'm goin' to Kansas City countin' every mile
I've been hitchhikin' every day and night yeah
Mostly hikin' every day and night
Just a few more miles
Old Casey will be in sight
When they lay me down
Beneath that cold cold ground
When they lay this old boy down
Beneath that cold cold ground
It'll be in Kansas City

No name soothe him Jim Jack or Joe they just called him Billy Bayou
Billy Billy Bayou watch where you go you're walkin' on quick sand and walk slow
Billy Billy Bayou watch what you say a pretty girl'll get you one of these days
Billy was a boy kinda big for a size red hair and freckles and big blue eyes
Thirteen years from the day he was born Billy fought the battle of the Little Big Horn
Billy Billy Bayou...
One said day Billy cried hoho I can whip the feathers of Geronimo
He smarted off the chief got mad this nearly ended our Louisiana lad
Billy Billy Bayou...
One day in eighteenseventyeight a pretty girl walked through Bill's front gate
He didn't know whether to stand there and run
He would up married cause he did neighter one
Billy Billy Bayou...
A pretty girl'll get you one of these days <start> I don't believe I'll fall in love today for if I did I know I wouldn't stay
I just can't make my heart find someone new it's always much too busy loving you
Each night I pray I'll wake at dawn and find another in my heart and on my mind
And I'll awake and I'll hear my poor heart say
That I don't believe I'll fall in love today
I don't believe I'll fall in love today old memories of you stand in the way
You'd come between us like you always do
Somehow they'd never measure up to you
Each night I pray... <start> A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord a wonderful Saviour to me
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock where rivers of pleasure I see
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock that shadows have dried thirsty land
He hideth my life in the depths of his love and covers me there with his hand
And covers me there with his hand
 piano 
A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord he taketh my burden away
He holdeth me up and Thy shall not be moved he giveth me strenght as my day
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock... <start> I knew when you left me that you'd be back someday
And I know there's a chance you'll leave again
But that's one I've got to take
Girl after all what have I got to lose
The worst that you can do is break my heart into
Smaller pieces bigger teardrops
Colder lonely hell why not
What's another goodbye
Might as well give it one more try
The worst that you can do is break my heart into
Smaller pieces
Darlin' come on in what are you waiting for
You might hurt me again
But you can't hurt me anymore
So tell me that you love me
And I'll tell myself it's true
The worst that you can do is break my heart into
Smaller pieces bigger teardrops
Colder lonely hell why not
What's another goodbye
Might as well give it one more try
The worst that you can do is break my heart into
Smaller pieces
Hell why not
What's another goodbye
Might as well give it one more try
Girl the worst that you can do is break my heart into
Smaller pieces
I knew when you left me
That you'd be back someday <start> 
Back in the days
When we used to dance
You chuckle every time that I misstep
Now that we're older
And our hairs get grey
You never cut me slack for my mistakes
You know I never meant to sink to such depths
Why would I jeopardize what we built behind that fence
Stay with me baby when you can
Its a pain to see but I'm still your man
Back in our time
Before the children
We were all the envy of our friends
Then we were blessed
Three little babies
Whatever broke we built it up again
You know I never meant to sink to the bottom
Why would I jeopardize what I built as a father
Stay with me on some lost weekend
It's a pain to see but our hearts we can mend
Back in the days
When we used to dance
You'd chuckle every time that I misstep
Now that we're older
And our hairs get grey
You never cut me slack for my mistakes
You know I never meant to sink to such depths
Why would I jeopardize what we built behind that fence
Stay with me baby when you can
It's a pain to see but you're still my man
It's a pain to see but I'm still your man <start> Waterloo Waterloo where will you meet your Waterloo
Every puppy has his day everybody has to pay everybody has to meet his Waterloo
Now ol' Adam was the first in history with an apple he was tempted and deceived
Just for spite the devil made him take a bite
And that's where ol' Adam met his Waterloo
Waterloo Waterloo...
Little General Napoleon of France tried to conquer the world but lost his pants
Met defeat known as Bonaparte's reterat and that's where Napoleon met his Waterloo
Waterloo Waterloo...
Now a feller who's darling proved untrue took her life but he lost his too
Now he swings where the little birdie sings
And that's where Tom Dooley met his Waterloo
Waterloo Waterloo... <start> Verse 
Rolled in as wild and free
As a clear water beach at seventeen memory
Eyes blue as the July sky
Sent shivers down my spine
Everytime that he smiled at me
PreChorus
The way he took off that white tshirt
The way he looked walking out of that water
And it just got hotterand hotter
Chorus
The tan line's fading on my sun kissed skin
Hits me like a wave when I think about it
Sublime on the boom box
Our bare feet in the sand
Makin' out on the boardwalk
My heart on fire in his hands
He drove away the first of September
But I remember
Yeah I remember
He talked like
And he walked like
And he looked like
And he burned like summersummer oh
He burned like summersummer oh
Verse 
His kiss was a sweet salt breeze
Had a hold on me like the moon pulls the tide
Took me up in the Ferris wheel
And I swear it feels like I never came down from the high
PreChorus
I know we never said forever
But something about it felt like it would never end
Chorus
The tan line's fading on my sun kissed skin
Hits me like a wave when I think about it
Sublime on the boom box
Our bare feet in the sand
Makin' out on the boardwalk
My heart on fire in his hands
He drove away the first of September
But I remember
Yeah I remember
He talked like
And he walked like
And he looked like
And he burned like summersummer oh
Bottle rocket sparks in the Florida sky
Summer summer
Something that bright's gotta burn out sometime
Chorus
The tan line's fading on my sun kissed skin
Hits me like a wave when I think about it
Sublime on the boom box
Our bare feet in the sand
Makin' out on the boardwalk
My heart on fire in his hands
He drove away the first of September
But I remember
Yeah I remember
He talked like
And he walked like
And he looked like
And he burned like summersummer oh
Yeah
He burned like summer summer
He burned like summer <start> Chorus
Sitting alone in the moonlight
Thinking of the days gone by
Wondering about my darling
I can still hear her saying goodbye
Oh the moon grows pale as I sit here
Each little star seems to whisper and say
Your sweetheart has found another
And now she's far far away
Chorus
Oh the moon grows pale as I sit here
Each little star seems to whisper and say
Your sweetheart has found another
And now she's far far away <start> 
I open up my door to greet the early morning sun
Closing it behind me and away I do run
To the meadow where the meadow lark is singing in the tree
In the meadow I go walking in the early morning breeze
I cup my hands to catch a multicolored butterfly
Perched upon the petals of flowers growing wild
Freeing it I watch it as it flies away from me
To visit with the flowers in the early morning breeze
Rainbow colored flowers kissed with early morning sun
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums
Drops of morning dew still linger on the iris leaves
In the meadow where I'm walking in the early morning breeze
Mistyeyed I look about the meadow where I stray
For its there I find the courage to greet the coming day
For there among the flowers I kneel gently to my knees
To have a word with God in the early mornig breeze <start> The reason why I've called us all together
Is to share with you some heartbreaking news
You see there's been a death in the family
And as relatives I thought it best you knew
By now you've noticed
Betty's not here with me
And Betty won't be joining us tonight
I said There's been a death in the family
After all the many years that I've loved her
She says she thinks it's best we live apart
Really there's been two deaths in the family
Betty's love for me and my poor heart
You'll all miss her at our family reunion
And I know you'll miss her smiles at Christmas time
But think of me and all the years I've loved her
And pray to God that I don't lose my mind <start> Well I start runnin' a fever
Every time he opens his mouth
She's been gawkin' at Jackson
Ever since his first song came out
Oh she loves Alan Jackson
And his pretty blonde hair
Oh I love Alan Jackson
I ain't got a prayer
Well he tried dressin' like Jackson
Belt buckles boots and a hat
She said Sorry hon that won't help you none
Because you're just too dang fat
Oh I hate Alan Jackson
She sleeps with a piece of his coat
Oh I love Alan Jackson
'Cause of them songs he wrote
Well I went backstage at his concert
I got on his bus somehow
That big talkin' man and his little five piece band
Just taught her what I didn't know how
Gosh I hate Alan Jackson
Now I'm his openin' act
Oh I love Alan Jackson
She's never comin' back
She loves you man
Oh I start runnin' a fever
Every time he opens his mouth
She's been gawkin' at Jackson
Ever since his first song came out
Oh she loves Alan Jackson
Makes me want to cuss
Oh he hates Alan Jackson
Think I'll blow up his bus
Yeah someday I'll rock his jukebox
No you're not
Might hit him with a tall tall tree
Well he just might hit you back
Well I tell you what
I'll show him the real world
He'll think real world when they find him
Way down yonder in the bottom of the chattahoochie
Oh yeah he just might run ya over with his mercury
I tell ya what tell him to meet me somewhere
Hey Hoss meet him at midnight in Montgomery
Wanted my life back
Who says you can't have it all
Alan Jackson <start> That big river's still rollin' through Memphis
And on Beale street they still play the blues
The smokie's still wear their halos
It's heaven on earth in the mornin' dew
They still make Jack Daniels in Lynchburg
On the Opry Mr Acuff's still keen
You can get the best biscuits and gravy
And Loretta can still really sing
But there's no love in Tennessee
At least not the kind I really need
The folks here will gladly give you a helpin' hand
But they can't help me get you back again
There's no love in Tennessee
I know it's a beautiful place to be
But without you here with me
There's no love in Tennessee
Remember up on look out mountain
Our future seemed so clear
Too bad Colorado came between us
Now I'll lookin' out through these tears
But I still love the magic of Dixie
Whoever said it gets in your blood was right
There's still no place better than home sweet home
But there's somethin' missin' tonight
There's no love in Tennessee
At least not the kind I really need
The folks here will gladly give you a helpin' hand
But they can't help me get you back again
There's no love in Tennessee
I know it's a beautiful place to be
But without you here with me
There's no love in Tennessee
There's no love in Tennessee
At least not the kind I really need
The folks here will gladly give you a helpin' hand
But they can't help me get you back again
There's no love in Tennessee <start> I'm drifting into deep water
I'm startin' to care for you
You're gettin' me into deep water
Be careful what you do
You want a romance
But I'm seekin' love
I know I'll regret it when it ends
I'm winding up in deep water
Why can't we just be friends
It's restless in this deep water
I'm lost between right and wrong
My love is true as deep water
You're love won't last as long
Where will it lead me
And where will it end
I can't help but wish I only knew
I'm winding up in deep water
So deep in love with you <start> Wake Up were going to the country
Were going to the country and well do it right
Cook up some sweet potatoes and tomorrow night

At the river I stand guide my feet hold my hand
Take my hand precious Lord lead me home
Precious Lord take my hand <start> I CAN'T SLEEP WITH YOU

WITH MARY LOU TURNER
I can't sleep with you I can't sleep with you
I can't sleep with you on my mind
Here I lay in bed tossing and turning
The fires of love we once knew are still burning
I'm living with your mem'ry all the time
I can't sleep with you I can't sleep with you
I can't sleep with you on my mind
I've tried everything I know to help my sleeping
But sleep won't come to eyes that burn from weeping
It's funny cause I've never been the crying kind
I can't sleep with you I can't sleep with you
I can't sleep with you on my mind
I have all the empty hours I can stand
Life is nothing to a woman without a love of her sweet man
And it seems like the nights just get longer and longer all the time
Cause I can't sleep with you I can't sleep with you
I can't sleep with you on my mind <start> There's a church in the valley by the Wildwood no lovelier place in the dale
No spot is so dear to my childhood as the little brown church in the vale
Come to the church in the Wildwood oh come to the church in the dale
No spot is so dear to my childhood as the little brown church in the vale
How sweet on a bright Sunday morning to listen to the clear ringing bell
Its tones so sweetly are calling come to the church in the vale
Come to the church in the Wildwood <start> Been around enough to know
When a man is lying its bound to show
Its written on his face
The letters in the capital case
Guilty of these crimes he cause
Treat cheaters like they fired the law
But he proclaims undying love
I wonder who hes speaking of
Cause all he ever seems to do is break my little heart in two
Its killing me to find a man out there
You'd think I'd find me one who cared
Show me some security and endues some sweet serenity
I cant keep up with who's is what
Boy this affair ain't fair enough
Men like him they love the chase
Girls give him time he'll throw the race
All he ever seems to do is break my little heart in two
I cant pretend I understand what makes a woman want a man
But all he ever seems to do is break her little heart in two
Run out the door jump in the car
But I never seem to get real far
Around the corner hit the gas
Drive fast enough and ill burn the past
Play the radio real loud
Days like this make mommas proud
Feeling free feels good to me
And I'm right back where I used to be
All he's ever going to do oh I know its sad but true
All he's ever going to do is break her little heart in two
Break her little heart in two <start> Summertime is past and gone and I'm on my way back home
To see the only one I ever loved
Now the moon is shining bright it lights my pathway tonight
Back to the only one I ever loved
Oh I know she waits for me back in ol' Tennessee
She was sent to me from God above
Now the moon is shining bright it lights my pathway tonight
Back to the only one I ever loved
Oh I know she waits for me back in ol' Tennessee
She was sent to me from God above
Now the moon is shining bright it lights my pathway tonight
Back to the only one I ever loved <start> I'd be the last one to tell you that you shouldn't go
And the first to say be happy if you can
But when you lie and hurt someone who needs and loves you so
Do you mind too much if I don't understand
I suppose that you're convinced this is the thing to do
Life is short and sweet break all the hearts you can
I guess I shouldn't be surprised it's all a game to you
But do you mind too much if I don't understand
Forgive me but it all seems so unreal to me
And my heart and me we'd made so many plans
But that's all over now there's nothing left to do
But do you mind too much if I don't understand
Forgive me but it all seems
But do you mind too much if I just don't understand <start> My life was empty so blue and alone
Then you've put your hand in mine and I knew why I was born
Born to love you born to love you born to share your smiles and tears
Born to be near if you need me dear born to love you till I die
I used to wonder what life held in store
Then you held me in your arms now I wonder no more
Born to love you...
Born to love you till I die <start> No nobody nobody ever died of a broken heart
It must've hit you like a hurricane
Now you're swimmin' with a ball and chain
Sweet love's gone down the drain
Down down
Girl you're lookin' like a walkin' dead
You need to drag a brush across that head
The crack of noon and you're still in bed
Wake up straighten up put on your makeup
No nobody nobody ever died of a broken heart
No nobody nobody ever died of a broken heart
You cut his head out of every picture
From the letters where he said that he missed you
All his memories well you can kiss 'em
Bye bye
When enough is for sure enough
It's time to shake it out and shake it up
Get in the middle of a great big love
Whambam thank you ma'am baby here we go again
No nobody nobody ever died of a broken heart
No nobody nobody ever died of a broken heart
Nobody ever died of a broken heart
Nobody ever died of a broken heart <start> Oh Nancy why'd you have to go and hurt yourself again
Why do you believe you've got to share in every body's pain
Oh heart of gold your always cryin someone else's tears
And tryin to protect the world and chase away its fears
Oh Nancy can't you see that you can't put the whole world right
It's not up to you to tuck life's difference to bed each night
I wish you could some how learn to take as well as give
Your so busy mendin other lives when you got your own to live 
You answer every SOS no pause or hesitation
I've seen my tired angel take on every situation
There's so much pain inside those eyes of blue
Oh Nancy I'm so in love with you
Oh Nancy your so full of love
And all I wants a part
Just a little place all to myself inside that great big heart
You never seem to realize that I'm unhappy to
But unlike the rest to put me right all I ever need is you
You answer every SOS no pause or hesitation
I've seen my tired angel take on every situation
There's so much pain inside those eyes of blue
Oh Nancy I'm so in love with you
Music ...
You answer every SOS no pause or hesitation
I've seen my tired angel take on every situation
There's so much pain inside those eyes of blue
Oh Nancy I'm so in love with you
Oh Nancy I'm so in love with you <start> Mister Sandman bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him two lips like roses and clover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over
Sandman I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic brean
Mister Sandman bring me a dream
Mister Sandman bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him the word that I'm not a rover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over
Mister Sandman bring me a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a come hither gleam
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace
Mister Sandman someone to hold
Would be so peachy before we're too old
Sp please turn on your magic beam
Mister Sandman bring us
Please please please
Mister Sandman bring us a dream <start> Get ups gimmicks one hit wonders that don't stick
Pretty boys acting tough boy bands give it up
And if it looks good on TV it'll look good on a CD
Shape it up trim it down who gives a damn 'bout how it sounds
I don't think Waylon done it that way
And if he was here he'd say Hoss neither did Hank
I ain't dogging what you're doing but boys come on let's get real
You still got a lotta boot left to fill
You say you're the real deal
But you play what nobody feels
You sing about Johnny Cash
The man in black would've whipped your ass
I don't think Waylon done it that way
And if he was here he'd say Hoss neither did Hank
I ain't dogging what you're doing but boys come on let's get real
You still got a lotta boot left to fill
So so long 'til I see you again
When you're laying in the bargain bin
Well I don't think Waylon done it that way
And if he was here he'd say Hoss neither did Hank
I ain't dogging what you're doing but then again hell yes I am
I just don't give a damn 'cause you still got a lotta boot left to fill
I guess we all got a lotta boot left to fill
Yeah that's right <start> See that train coming round the bend
Carrying the one that I love
Her beautiful body is still here on earth
But her soul has been called up above
Body and Soul Body and Soul
That's how she loved me with Body and Soul
Her beautiful hair was the purest of gold
Her eyes were as blue as the sea
Her lips were the color of summer's red rose
And she promised she would always love me
Tomorrow as the sun sinks low
The shadows will cover her face
As her last sun goes down she's laid beneath the ground
And my teardrops are falling like rain <start> A candle on the windowsill
Burning bright burning still
Need you home it lights the way
There today like yesterday
And you don't have to explain
I got your blood running through my veins
And it don't matter where you've been
Through the thick and through the thin
Say a prayer say my name
I am the keeper of the flame
And you don't have to explain
I got your blood running through my veins
And you don't have to explain
I got your blood running through my veins
All your secrets have a home
They won't be traded it won't be so
Whisper softly in my ear
When you want 'em they are here
And you don't have to explain
I got your blood running through my veins
And you don't have to explain
I got your blood running through my veins
And you don't have to explain
I got your blood running through my veins
And you don't have to explain
I got your blood running through my veins <start> Like a wond'rous dream that ends with dawn
Your love touched my heart then you were gone
Though I couldn't keep you for my own you're the only happiness I've known
You're the one who taught me how to smile your love brightened up my world awhile
Warm and tender darling you remain just a little sunshine in the rain
You're the one who taught me
Just a little sunshine in the rain <start> If you got it on nine you got it too low
Crank that ten 'til the Kenwoods blow
Two in the morning ain't late enough
We gon' be here 'til the sun shows up
You had one shot baby take one more
If you had two make it three maybe four
Feeling like you're ten feet off the floor
You know what you came here for
Whatever you got to raise up
You can't get it high enough
Your hands or your phone or your cup
Set it off like the th Of July
And take it up to the sky
We'll be flying up in the clouds
Like we're never gonna come back down
Like we're running out of runway lights
Gonna take it up to the sky
We're gonna touch the stars
Baby no it ain't that far
If you sitting down get up on your feet
If you're standing up get up on your seat
If you on your seat find a girl who don't know you
Spin a little game get her up on your shoulders
If she wants to dance give her what you got
Turn a cool night into sunburn hot
If she starts getting that look her in her eye
Take her to the moon at night
Whatever you got to raise up
You can't get it high enough
Your hands or your phone or your cup
Set it off like the th Of July
Take it up to the sky
We'll be flying up in the clouds
Like we're never gonna come back down
Like we're running out of runway lights
Gonna take it up to the sky
We're goin' up to the sky we're goin' up to the sky
We're goin' up to the sky we're so high oh yeah
Whatever you got to raise up
Whatever you got to raise up
You can't get it high enough
Your hands or your phone or your cup
Set it off like the th Of July
Go on and take it up to the sky
We'll be flying up in the clouds
Like we're never gonna come back down
Like we're running out of runway lights
Gonna take it up to the sky
We're gonna touch the stars
Baby no it ain't that far come on
Go on and take it up to the sky
We'll be flying up in the clouds
Like we're never gonna come back down
Like we're running out of runway lights
Take it up to the sky <start> The strange young man who comes to me
A soldier on a three day spree
He needs one night's cheap ecstasy
And a woman's arms to hide him
He greets me with a courtly bow
And hides his pain by acting proud
He drinks too much and he laughs too loud
How can I deny him
Let us dance beneath the moon
I'll sing to you 'Claire de Lune'
The morning always comes too soon
But tonight the war is over
He speaks to me in schoolboy French
Of a soldier's life inside a trench
Of the look of death and the ghastly stench
I do my best to please him
He puts two roses in a vase
Two roses sadly out of place
Like the gallant smile on his haggard face
Playfully I tease him
Hold me 'neath the Paris skies
Let's not talk of how or why
Tomorrow's soon enough to die
But tonight the war is over
We make love too hard too fast
He falls asleep his face a mask
He wakes with the shakes and he drinks from his flask
I put my arms around him
They die in the trenches and they die in the air
In Belgium and France the dead are everywhere
They die so so fast there's no time to prepare
A decent grave to surround them
Old world glory old world fame
The old world's gone gone up in flames
Nothing will ever be the same
And nothing lasts forever
Oh I'd pray for him but I've forgotten how
And there's nothing nothing that can save him now
There's always another with the same funny bow
And who am I to deny them <start> Well it's lonesome in this old town everybody puts me down
I'm a face without a name just a walking in the rain
I'm going back to Houston Houston Houston
I got holes in both of my shoes I'm a walking case of the blues
Saw a dollar yesterday but the wind blew it away
I'm going back to Houston Houston Houston
 harmonica  ac.guitar 
I haven't eaten in about a week I'm so hugry when I walk I squeak
Nobody calls me friend it's sad the shape I'm in
I'm going back to Houston Houston Houston
Got a girl waitin' there for me where at least she said she'd be
I got a home and a good warm bed and a feather pillow for my head
I'm going back to Houston Houston Houston
Well it's lonesome in this old town everybody puts me down
I'm a face without a name yeah I'm a walkin' in the rain
I'm going back to Houston Houston Houston <start> I wouldn't be half lit drunk
Digging 'round the danger
Wrapping my number on a coaster
Sliding it to a stranger
Walking crooked justifying all my bad behavior
Tangled up in someone's arms I know I won't see later
I wouldn't be getting good at getting good at staying calm
Or sitting high and mighty on my broken throne
I wouldn't be cursing God for leaving me here all alone
I wouldn't be stuck between a rock and being stung
If love was fair
I'd be golden
Cause you'd be there
I know it's patient
I know it's kind
But it wouldn't change its mind
And I feel there
If love was fair
I wouldn't be replaying what it was and what it wasn't
Or thinking I could change if I only saw it coming
It wouldn't take everything I have to rise above it
There'd be some kind of peace
Yeah there'd be some kind of justice
If love was fair
I'd be golden
Cause you'd be there
I know it's patient
I know it's kind
But it wouldn't change its mind
And I feel there
If love was fair
Love is twisted
It has its rules
And I'd be over it like you
If love was fair
I'd be golden
Cause you'd be there
I know it's patient
I know it's kind
But it wouldn't change its mind
And I feel there
If love was fair <start> I get a sad kind of feeling
When I see a passenger train
In this fast movin' world we live in
Nobody rides them much these days
Oh maybe I'm just sentimental
'Cause I know that things have to change
But I still like to go for a train ride
'Cause I've got a thing about trains
Train train train you're out of place these days
But you've had your days of glory train train train
Train they say you're too slow for travelin'
But I'm gonna miss you some day
When my little boy says
Daddy what was it like to ride a train
I'll say it was a good way to travel
When things didn't move quite so fast
And I'm sorry that you can't ride one
But trains are the thing of the past
Train train train you're fading from the scene
But I'm gonna mourn your passing train train train
So if you're tired of people and buildings
Weary of worry and strain
Then you ought to go on a train ride
And look out the window at things
Go for a ride down to Memphis
The night train is still right on time
But I read in the papers this mornin'
Next week they're gonna take it off the line
Train train train blow your whistle proudly and loud
As you roll to your place in history train train train
I've got a thing about trains <start> Tuxedo waiters black tie
White table clothes and red wine
We've been planning this night
Looking forward to it for some time
Now honey I know you love getting dressed up
And you know I love showing you off
But watching your baby blue eyes
Dancing in the candle light glow
All I can think about is getting you home
Walking through the front door
Seeing your black dress hit the floor
Uh honey there sure ain't nothing like you loving
Me all night long and all I can think about is getting you home
I don't need this menu no I don't
I already know just what I want
Did I hear you right did you tell me
Go pay the waiter and lets leave
Now honey I know by that look in your eyes
And your hand drawing hearts on mine
That our night out of the house ain't gonna last too long
When all you can think about is getting me home
Walking through the front door
Seeing your black dress hit the floor
Uh honey there sure ain't nothing like you loving me
All night long
And all I can think about is getting you home <start> Stood by the window
watch him walked away.
Saw the wind blow his hair
thru the tears of my eyes.
No one had to tell me
My heart know for certain.
But thru the lies and lines I've heard..
every spoken word and in the cold hard truth.
I taste my bitter sweet waste of youth.
Tomorrow I'm gonna get up I'm gonna make me Shine.
But tonight I'm going to cry
for what once was mine.
I hold on for dear life
'till it comes judgement day.
True love never dies..It just walks away......
JUDGEMENT DAY
JUDGEMENT DAY
These memories surround me
but don't make a sound.
Like thieves in the night
They come sneak'n around.
Hear'm silently shouting
'till I'm down on my knees.
So I'm going to lie on this floor
In my black funeral dress and...
...Grieve for the man who held my heart in his hands.
Then tomorrow I'm going to get up and make me shine.
But tonight I'm going to cry for that hard hearted man.
No matter how hard I try I could not live that way.
True love never dies it just walks away....
JUDGEMENT DAY
JUDGEMENT DAY
Down for the count
Life took the breath out of me.
The more That I cared
The more I just wanted to be free.
So tonight I'm going to cry
for what once was mine.
I'll hold on for dear life
til it comes... JUDGEMENT DAY....
True love never dies It just walks away......
AWAY
JUDGEMENT DAY
AWAY
JUDGEMENT DAY
OHHH AWAY
JUDGEMENT DAY
OHHH AWAY
JUDGEMENT DAY <start> In a bar in Acuna called Ma Crosby's
I found myself not feeling any pain
I told a 'Frisco girl I'd come for freedom
She said she'd only come to catch a train
We struck up some idle conversation
Traded all the troubles on our minds
One thing led to another in the evening
And I fell in love again for my last time
Blame it on Mexico if you need a reason
Say too much guitar music tequila salt and lime
Blame it on Mexico but she's the reason
That I fell in love again for my last time
Daylight dawned and found me in Del Rio
In a rundown motel room as dark as hell
I felt all the pains of a morning after
And all alone as far as I could tell <start> Smooth land a risin'
Eastern Idaho plateau
White Cloud's on the horizon
As up the highway I go
To where the mighty Buffalo
Starts its journey to the sea
I can feel Lady Idaho
Callin' out for me
She's reachin' out for me
And oh that blue water's rollin'
High and muddy in the spring
Feel her sweet but cold wind
Can you listen to her sing
Through the valley and the timber below
A whisper through the aspen tree
I can feel Lady Idaho
Callin' out for me
She's reachin' out for me
Oh the color on the mountain
And the color in the sky
Autumn in the air
And a tear in my eye
For I could never stay I know
But my heart will never leave
For I can feel Lady Idaho
Callin' out for me
She's reachin' out for me
She's holdin' on to me <start> Well in my time of dying
I don't want nobody to moan
All I want my friends to do
Come and fold my dying arms

So I can die easy

So I can die easy

So I can die easy
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed
Won't you meet me Jesus meet me
Won't you meet me in the middle of the air
And if these wings should fail me Lord
Won't you meet me with another pair

Won't you meet me Jesus

Won't you meet me Jesus

Won't you meet me Jesus
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed
Now I'm going on down to the river
Stick my sword up in the sand
Gonna shout my troubles over Lord
I done made it to the promised land

I done crossed over

I done crossed over

I done crossed over
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed
Ever since I've been acquainted with Jesus
We haven't been a minute apart
He placed the receiver in my ear
Threw religion in my heart

I can ring up my Jesus

I can ring up my Jesus

I can ring up my Jesus
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed
Now I'm going on down to the river
Stick my sword up in the sand
Gonna shout my troubles over Lord
I done made it to the promised land

I done crossed over

I done crossed over

I done crossed over
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed <start> Are you mine all life through will you kiss me when I'm blue
Will you whisper I love you and make all my dreams come true
Will you share the good and bad bring me joy when I am sad
Tell me darling are you mine and only mine
Are you mine  all the time 
Mine alone  all my own 
No one else will ever do I'll be yours and I'll be true
Don't worry dear have no fear cause I'm yours
Are you mine tell me dear will I always have you near
Will the love light always shine in your heart just like in mine
Will you give as well as take keep the vows that you will make
Tell me darling are you mine and only mine
Are you mine  all the time 
Mine alone  all my own 
No one else will ever do
Are you mine rich or poor tell me darling are you sure
Will you whisper yes I do and forever love me true
Will you honor and obey will you promise not to stray
Tell me darling are you mine and only mine
Are you mine 
Don't worry dear have no fear cause I'm yours <start> Ser que amar sozinho vai ser a minha sina
J conheo voc bem mais do que imagina
Sua cor preferida  o verde
Seu aniversrio  dia trs
Adora mexer no cabelo
Curte rock fala ingls
Odeia filme de terror
Canta e toca violo

Tem medo de escurido
Ah eu amo voc
Teus segredos vou aprender a decifrar
Teus desejos me ensina a realizar
Eu te estudo te admiro te espero
Ser que um dia vai me amar
Sua cor preferida  o verde
Seu aniversrio  dia trs
Adora mexer no cabelo
Curte rock fala ingls
Odeia filme de terror
Canta e toca violo
Tem cimes dos amigos

Ser que um dia vai me amar <start> 


Workin' on the railroad
Sleepin' on the ground
Eatin' saltine crackers
Ten cents a pound
Big Ball's in Cowtown
We'll all go down
Big Ball's in Cowtown
We'll dance around


I'll go to Cowtown
I'll dance around
Board up your windows
The big boy's in town
Big Ball's in Cowtown
We'll all go down
Big Ball's in Cowtown
We'll dance around
Put on your new shoes
Put on your gown
Shake off them sad blues
The Big Ball's in town
Big Ball's in Cowtown
We'll all go down
Big Ball's in Cowtown
We'll dance around
 <start> Feelings are strange Especially when they come true
And I got a feeling that you'd be leaving soon
So I tried to rearrange on my emotion
But it seem to say no matter what I do
Blue umbrella rest on my shoulder
Hiding the pain while the rain mixed up my mind
My feet wet for thinking this thing over
And it's been so long since I felt the Warm sunshine
Just give me one good reason and I promise I won't ask for any more
Just give me one extra season so I can figure out the other far
Music.
Daytime makes me wonder why you left me
Nighttime makes me wonder what I said
Next time are the words I'd like to plan on
Last time was the only thing we'd said <start> THE STORY OF MY LIFE
WRITERS BURT BACHARACH HAL DAVID
Someday I'm going to write The story of my life I'll tell about the night we met And how my heart can't forget The way you smiled at me I want the world to know The story of my life About the night your lips met mine And that first exciting time I held you close to me The sorrow in our love was breakin' up The mem'ry of a broken heart But later on the joy of makin' up Never never more to part There's one thing left to do Before my story's through I've got to take you for my wife So the story of my life Can start and end with you The sorrow in our love was breakin' up The mem'ry of a broken heart But later on the joy of makin' up Never never more to part There's one thing left to do Before my story's through I've got to take you for my wife So the story of my life Can start and end Can start and end Can start and end with you <start> There you go pretending that you own me
Acting like you turn the world in which I live
There you go pretending that you'll never hurt me
Acting like an angel that I should forgive
There you go now can't you see I'm not part of your show now
I'm just a fool not the leading guy you used to know
There you go pretending that you'll never hurt me
Acting like you turn the world in which I live
There you go acting like I'll always need you
There you go guess you think I always will
There you go guess you think I always will <start> I dont watch a lot of TV
But I think I know whats good
Whats good is what weve got
Whats bad is that weve not
Tried to show each other proof
But I think that I could hold you
Maybe then youd sing along
We could walk down to the beach
Get swept up by the sea
And never tell them that weve gone
I will search for you in the shadows
I will search for you in the light
I will search for you in the morning
I will search for you in the night
Dont have to sit in stony silence
While the rest of the world fights
We could gather up our fears
Take them to the pier
And throw them out like rice
We could stand up on the rooftop
Shout at the top of our lungs
Starting with today
We wont be afraid
Of growing old and dying young
I will search for you in the shadows
I will search for you in the light
I will search for you in the morning
I will search for you in the night

I will search for you in the shadows
I will search for you in the light
I will search for you in the morning
I will search for you in the night
Woah woah woah woah
Woah woah woah woah
Woah woah woah woah
Woah woah woah woah <start> I'm a little bit rough around the edges
Yeah girl I've been known
To fall too hard
I ain't afraid to dance around
On jagged ledges
That's why I'm rough
Around the edges of my heart
I'm a working man
I've got callused hands
And I can't stand a suit and tie
Hey I'm at home in here
I like this atmosphere
And drinking beer on a Friday night
I've been knowing you
For a dance or two
I think I'd better warn you now
I'm a little bit rough around the edges
Yeah girl I've been known
To fall too hard
I ain't afraid to dance around
On jagged ledges
That's why I'm rough
Around the edges of my heart
I could fall for you
Before this night is through
And if I do hey that's okay
I'd like to share my dreams
Friends and front porch swings
The simple things hey what do you say
You don't know me yet
I work without a net
And what you see is what you get <start> Getting in deep losing my sleep
Thinking of you all the time
I feel I'm falling under your spell
About to lose my mind
But it's too late to turn back now
It's too late now
Too late to turn back now
You got me now
Feel the danger in your touch
Haunts me night and day
You know I want you way too much
But I can't walk away
'Cause it's too late to turn back now
It's too late now
Too late to turn back now
You got me now <start> I was a fool broke every rule blue darlin'
Saw the tears take the place of your sweet smile
I played it smart I broke your heart blue darlin'
And lost the only love in life worthwhile
So please please forgive me
I'm sorry for the wrong that I've done
My heart would cry if ever I should lose you
Blue darlin' you're the only only one
Im askin you what can I do blue darlin
To let you know I love you so and did you know
Id walk through fire you I desire blue darlin
My bleeding heart is torn apart I feel so low
So please please forgive me
I'm sorry for the wrong that I've done
My heart would cry if ever I should lose you
Blue darlin' you're the only only one
So please please forgive me
I'm sorry for the wrong that I've done
My heart would cry if ever I should lose you
Blue darlin' you're the only only one
Blue darlin youre the only only one <start> Please help me I'm falling
In love with you
Close the door to temptation
don't let me walk through
Turn away from me darling
I'm begging you to
Please help me I'm falling
In love with you
I belong to another
Whose arms have grown cold
But i promised forever
To have and to hold
I can never be free dear
But when I'm with you
I know that I'm losing
The will to be true
Please help me I'm falling
And that would be sin
Close the door to temptation
don't let me walk in
For i mustn't want you
But darling i do
Please help me I'm falling
In love with you <start>  Bill 
The night was black the roads were icy snow was fallin' drips were high
And I was weary from my drivin' so I stopped to rest for a while
I sat down at a truck stop I was thinkin' about my past
I've had a long streak of a bad luck but I pray it's gone at last
Gone at last  gone at last 
Gone at last  gone at last 
I've had a long streak of a bad luck but I pray it's gone at last
 dobro 
 Mary Lou 
Well I ain't dumb I kicked around some I have thought too easily
But that boy looked so deductive he just grabbed my sympathy
Sweet little woman what's your problem tell me why you're so down cast
I've had a long streak of a bad luck but I pray it's gone at last
Gone at last...
 dobro 
 Bill 
Once in awhile from out of nowhere at least expected and we ran to pair
Somebody will come and lift you higher and your burdens will be shared
 Mary Lou 
I do believe if I hadn't met you I might still be sinking fast
I've had a long streak of a bad luck but I pray it's gone at last
 Both 
Gone at last...
But I pray it's gone at last
 dobro  <start> Well it was Friday in the p.m.
And just like every weekend
I was ready to throw down
Yeah I get a little tore up
So I call my bros up to meet me out on the town
Well wild man Willy said I like to really
But Idol was on TV
And Ray had a date
With his wife and Nate quit drinking
But he didn't tell me
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all that ain't right
It's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight
Well I was flying solo down at Silverado's
The joint looking like a morgue
When this country cutie with a rock and roll booty
Came strutting in through the door
Yelled who wants to dance and fired up the band
With with a Franklin and a shot of patron
She looked right at me and said
What's it gonna be
Are you gonna let me to party alone
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all that ain't right
It's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all that ain't right
It's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight
Come on come on
Get your good time on
Let's have a little fun tonight <start> I I would follow you
Around the world and back again
Yes I'd give anything
Just to see your face another day
And time is a precious thing
When tomorrow you fly away
But I see you on the phone
But it's not you just shades of gray
And I miss you
I can't wait to kiss you
Yes I miss you
I can't wait to kiss you
When you come around back
I can make a choice
To fade away or make a stand
And you gave me my voice
But being gone wasn't in my plan
And I miss you
I can't wait to kiss you
Yes I miss you
I can't wait to kiss you
When you come around
Boy you've been everywhere
You go around the world and back again
With you I can be myself
But tonight I'm going to be alone
And I miss you
I can't wait to kiss you
Yes I miss you
I can't wait to kiss you
And I miss you
I can't wait to kiss you
Yes I miss you
I can't wait to kiss you
When you come around
Come around come around
When you come around
Come around come around
Come around <start> What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping
This this is Christ the king
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste haste to bring him laud the babe the son of Mary
Why lies he in such mean estate
Where ox and cattle are feeding
Good Christians fear for sinners here
The silent word is pleading
This this is Christ the king
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste haste to bring him laud the babe the son of Mary
So bring him insence gold and myrrh
Come peasant king to own him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone him
This this is Christ the king
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste haste to bring him laud the babe the son of Mary <start> Been tryin' so hard just to talk to you
Haven't heard half of what you want me to
Hurt so bad over where we've been
Don't know how not to go back there again
I know what I want to say
How can I get it through to you now in some other way
Like
There was this woman
And there was this man
There was this moment they had a chance to hold on to what they had
How could they be so in love and still never see
That nothing could be sadder than this woman this woman and this man
A stranger's eyes and a lover's face
Still no signs of a better time and place
Have we lost the key to an open door
I feel the need to reach out to you even more
It's a circle we're going 'round
How can I get us out from under It's gonna take us down
See
There was this woman
And there was this man
There was this moment they had a chance to hold on to what they had
How could they be so in love and still never see
That we can get it back again
This woman this woman and this man
For all we got to lose
It's so much a gain
That we could come this far and leave it behind
There's only you and me to blame
There was this woman
And there was this man
There was this moment they had a chance to hold on to what they had
How could they be so in love and still never see
That nothing could be sadder than this woman this woman and this man
How could they be so in love
And still never see
That we can get it back again
This woman this woman and this man <start> Jealousy night and day you torture me
I sometimes wonder
If this spell that I'm under
Can only be a melody
For I know no one but me has won your heart but
When the music starts my peace departs
From the moment they play that lovely strain
And we surrender to all its charm again
This jealousy that tortures me is ecstasy mystery pain
We dance to a tango of love
Your heart beats with mine as we sway
Your eyes give the answer I'm dreaming of
That soft word your cruel lips will never say
I fear that the music will end
And shatter the spell it may lend
To make me believe when your eyes just deceive
But it's only the tango you love
I fear that the music will end
And shatter the spell it may lend
To make me believe when your eyes just deceive
And it's only the tango you love
It's only the tango that you love <start> There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many poor boys and Lord I know I'm one
My mother she was a taylor she sowed my new blue jeans
My father he was a gambler way down in New Orleans
The only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he'll be satisfied is when he's all a drunk
There is a house in New Orleans
Poor mother go tell all your children not to do what I have done
Spend your life in sin and misery in a house of the Rising Sun
Well I got one foot on the black farm the other foot on a train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans wear that ball and chain
There is a house in New Orleans
Yes Lord I know I'm on <start> Well in North Carolina way back in the hills
Me and my old pappy had a hand in a still
We brewed white lightnin' 'til the sun went down
Then he'd fill him a jug and he'd pass it around
Mighty mighty pleasin pappy's corn squeezin'
Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'
Chorus
Well the G men T men revenuers too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were looking tryin to book him
But my pappy kept acookin'
Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'
 Instrumental 
Well I asked my old pappy why he called his brew
White lightnin' 'stead of mountain dew
I took a little sip and right away I knew
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue
Lightnin' started flashin' and thunder started crashin'
Shhhoooh . . . white lightnin'
Chorus
Well the G men T men revenuers too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were looking tryin to book him
but my pappy kept acookin'
Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'
Well a city slicker came and he said I'm tough
I think I wanna taste that powerful stuff
He took one ggglug and drank it right down
And I heard him a moaning as he hit the ground
Mighty mighty pleasin pappy's corn squeezin'
Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'
Chorus
Well the G men T men revenuers too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were looking tryin to book him
but my pappy kept acookin'
Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'... <start> Dim lights thick smoke and loud loud music
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Dim lights thick smoke and loud loud music
You'll never make a wife to a homeloving man
A home and little children mean nothing to you
A house filled with love and a husband so true
You'd rather have a drink with the first guy you meet
And the only home you'll know is the club down the street
A drinking and dancing to a honky tonk band
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Go out and have your fun you think you've played it smart
I'm sorry for you and your honky tonk heart <start> HEARTS IN MY DREAM
Writers George Jones Roger Miller
I dreamed that all the hearts I've broken came to visit me
And in my sleep they came to pay me for their misery
They were all so torn and shattered Oh such tales of woe
It was I who caused them all and my conscience hurts me so
Hearts in my dream
Each one of them true
Each one loved me so
Each one I broke in two
My younger days were wild and reckless
Just love 'em and let 'em be
Those days are gone although it took a dream to make me see
Hearts in my dream
Each one of them true
Each one loved me so
Each one I broke in two
My younger days were wild and reckless
Just love 'em and let 'em be
Those days are gone although it took a dream to make me see <start> There's two things I know for sure
She was sent here from heaven and she's Daddy's little girl
As I drop to my knees by her bed at night
She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes
And I thank God for all of the joy in my life
Oh but most of all for..
Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
Walk beside the pony Daddy it's my first ride
I know the cake looks funny Daddy but I sure tried
Oh with all that I've done wrong I must have done something right
To deserve a hug every morning and butterfly kisses at night
Sweet sixteen today
And she's lookin' like her mamma a little more every day
One part woman the other part girl
To perfume and makeup from ribbons and curls
Trying her wings out in a great big world
But I remember...
Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
You know how much I love you Daddy
But if you don't mind I'm only gonna kiss you on the cheek this time
Oh with all that I've done wrong I must have done something right
To deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses at night
Oh the precious times
Oh like the wind the years go by
Precious butterfly
Spread your wings and fly
She'll change her name today
and she'll make a promise and I'll give her away
Standing in the bride room just staring at her
She asked me what I'm thinking and I said I'm not sure
I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl
And she leaned over...and gave me...
Butterfly kisses with her mamma there
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
Walk me down the aisle Daddy it's just about time
Does my wedding gown look pretty Daddy Daddy don't cry
Oh with all that I've done wrong I must have done something right
To deserve a her love every morning and butterfly kisses
I couldn't ask God for more
Man this is what love is
I know I've gotta let her go but I'll always remember
Every hug in the morning and butterfly kisses <start> I can't say that it's black I can't say that it's white
Is it really wrong is it really right
We don't know where to place it I guess we'll have to face it
We walk the thin grey line of love
We shouldn't be together we have so much to lose
One of us must make the choice but please don't make me choose
I feel I've got to have you I feel the same way too
Our love should go for we both know we walk the thin grey line of love
We both tried hard to break up but we just break each vow
If you'll just say you don't love me I'd stay away somehow
But you know I can't say it and I'd die if you could
We'll break our home as if we'll go on walkin' the thin grey line of love
Yes we walk the thin grey line of love <start> On a cold Montana morning on the road to Idaho
I watched her order hot and black to go
In her boots and spurs and blue jeans
And the lonely in her eyes
Told me just how much she loved the rodeos
I asked where she was headin'
She said the Boise show
She took a third in Butte just yesterday
She never has been married
And she probably never will
Silver buckle dreams
Don't leave time for standing still
Round and round and round she goes
Where she stops nobody knows
The miles are gettin' longer
The nights they never end
Oh the rodeos and livestock shows
Keep the lady on the go
Lord she loves to run those barrels
It's the only life she knows
For now on fifteen seasons
The circuit's been her home
At times she misses kids she never had
But she wouldn't trade a minute
Of the years that she's got in it
She's had herself some happy
She's learned to take the sad
When I looked up from my coffee
I saw Boise on her mind
She had that look of leavin' in her eyes
As she drove into the morning
It slowly dawned on me
How hard it is to tell a dream goodbye
Round and round and round she goes
Where she stops nobody knows
The miles are gettin' longer
The nights they never end
Oh the rodeos and livestock shows
Keep the lady on the go
Lord she loves to run those barrels
It's the only life she knows
Lord she loves to run those barrels
It's the only life she knows <start> 
Chorus

Wheels of fortune rollin'
It don't matter where we're goin'
East or west or south to Tennessee

Wheels of fortune movin'
Keep on truckin' keep on movin'
Gotta stay ahead of the finance company
Well I was downandout until this friend a' mine
He said I got somethin' here guaranteed ta change yer luck.
With just a few thousand dollars you can get on time
I can put you in a brandnew diesel truck.
He says You can make a fortune in a year or two
It's easy all ya haveta do is drive.
Well I signed my name and I took the keys and then I knew
I was gonna be the richest man alive
Chorus

Wheels of fortune rollin'
It don't matter where we're goin'
East or west or south to Tennessee

Wheels of fortune movin'
Keep on truckin' keep on movin'
Gotta stay ahead of the finance company
Now I ain't seen my lady in a month or two
This old rig may cost me my family
'Cause when I truck on home you know just what they do
They treat me just like I was company
Now I'm lost and lonely on this Interstate
My CB's broke and I ain't got a dime
I got a payment due and the finance comp'ny just won't wait
I gotta keep this rig amovin' all the time
Chorus

Wheels of fortune rollin'
It don't matter where we're goin'
East or west or south to Tennessee

Wheels of fortune movin'
Keep on truckin' keep on movin'
Gotta stay ahead of the finance company
Gotta stay ahead of the finance company <start> Sometimes you've got to take the heat
If you're gonna walk down the mean street
Take the heat and you see it through
Cause sometimes it comes down to
Do what you gotta do
Sometimes it goes right down to the wire
And you might have to walk through the fire
Walk on boy all the way through
Sometimes it just comes down to
Do what you gotta do
Well there's people that'll tell you
It's just no use
And there's people that'll tell you
That you're gonna lose
People that'll tell you
Anything you're gonna listen to
Do what you gotta do
Someday they're going to call your name
They'll come looking for some one to blame
What's your name boy
Hey you just tell them true
Cause they can't take the truth from you
So do what you gotta do
Well they'll call you a hero or a traitor
But you'll find out that sooner or later
Nobody in this world is gonna do it for you
Do what you gotta do
There ain't nobody in this world
That's gonna do it for you
Do what you gotta do <start> I bite the hands that I hold by lying through my teeth
The funny thing about me is Im an angel underneath
I bringa knife to my throat by leaving tongue unsheathed
The irony of all this is Im an angel underneath
People often say to me the devil mustve made you do it.
I reply theyre right because he had the chance in hell
And he blew it
May Heaven help me survive the fate Ive been bequeathed
Because nobody believes that Im an angel underneath
People often say to me the devil mustve made you do it.
I reply theyre right because he had the chance in hell
And he blew it
May Heaven help me survive the fate Ive been bequeathed
Because nobody believes that Im an angel underneath
And Im an angel underneath
And Im an angel underneath
And Im an angel underneath yeah.
And Ill sing of you til it hurts
Until its just more notes and more words
Its a shot in the dark
Resurrection of a tattered heart
So let it take all night
Send me a phoenix to show me the light
And Ill sing of you til it hurts
Until its just more notes and more words
Dry blood on these strings
Notebook full of needles and pins
And as I sing this refrain
The thought of you no longer drives me insane
And Ill sing of you til it hurts
Until its just more notes and more words
Ill sing of you til it hurts
Until its just more notes and more words
Ill sing of you til it hurts
Until its just more notes and more words
Though it still makes me cry
Just one last time as I say goodbye
A way to cope with the facts
To watch it burn turn red into black
Ill sing of you til it hurts
Until its just more notes and more words <start> Silent night holy night
All is calm all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born
Silent night holy night
Son of God love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace <start> I grew up in the scantling yards of Wheeling West Virginia
A wheelhouse cub looking for an open door
In the packet ways a Sweeney wed the keel of my Bonita
Just two months from her timbers 'til she moored
I paid the fare in billet on her maiden voyage to Vicksburg
And talked my way to hand the tiller on the course
In her planks I carved a notch and sealed the vow 'Be my Bonita'
And her dowry was my life between the shores
I was born with rouging ways and she steered me like a woman
From the port calls and the bawds that lead me stray
The calliope serenades made the old towns come running
And the boys would gamble shards to pull her chains
The striker's boast would fain me loss about the wrecks the shoals were keeping
And how the old girl's got poor Billy's ransom saved
On the lake at Bistineau she set the wharf at Dixie
With a thousand bales of cotton on her main
As the great raft disappeared the watermark went sinking
And she was stuck right hard a listing on the bank
With the furnace still a blaze I stood my last upon her
Then climbed the prow and took a landsman's trade
'A derelict now Milady' said the watch log I've concorded
'Have the bosun sound us eight bells for the change'
Cause I was born with rouging ways and she steered me like a woman
From the port calls and the bawds that lead me stray
The calliope serenades made the old towns come running
And the boys would gamble shards to pull her chains
And I would take to wider walks so the gin I stopped a drinking
At three scores aloft this crooked frame
The striker's boast would fain me loss about the wrecks the shoals were keeping
And how the old girl's got poor Billy's ransom saved <start> Big Sam left Seattle in the year of ninetytwo
With George Pratt his partner and brother Billy too
They crossed the Yukon river and they found the bonanza gold
Below that old white mountain
Just a little southeast of Nome
Sam crossed the Majestic mountains to the valleys far below
He talked to his team of huskies
As he mushed on through the snow
With the northen lights arunnin' wild
In the land of the midnight sun
Yes Sam McCord was a mighty man
In the year of nineteenone
Where the river is windin' big nuggets they're findin'
North to Alaska go north the rush is on
North to Alaska go north the rush is on
George turns to Sam with his gold in his hand
Said Sam you're lookin' at a lonely lonely man
I'd trade all the gold that's buried in this land
For one small band of gold to place on sweet little Jenny's hand
'Cause a man needs a woman to love him all the time
Remember Sam a true love is so hard to find
I'd build for my Jenny a honeymoon home
Below that old white mountain
Just a little southeast of Nome
Where the river is windin' big nuggets they're findin'
North to Alaska go north the rush is on
North to Alaska go north the rush is on <start> Comb your hair and paint and powder
You act proud and I'll act prouder
You sing loud and I'll sing louder
Tonight we're settin' the woods on fire
You're my gal and I'm your feller
Dress up in your frock and yeller
I'll look swell but you'll look sweller
Settin' the woods on fire
We'll take in all the honky tonks
Tonight we're havin' fun
We'll show the folks a brand new dance
That never has been done
Well I don't care who thinks we're silly
You'll be daffy and I'll be dilly
Order up two bowls of chili
Settin' the woods on fire
Hmm I'll gas up my hot rod stoker
We'll get hotter than a poker
You'll be broke but I'll be broker
Tonight we're settin' the woods on fire
We'll sit close to one another up our street
And down the other
We'll have us a time oh brother
Settin' the woods on fire
We'll put aside a little time
To fix a flat or two
My trey and tubes are doin' fine
The air's showin' through
You clap hands and I'll start bowin'
We'll do all the law's allowin'
Tomorrow I'll be right back plowin'
Settin' the woods on fire <start> We live in trailers and apartments too
From California to Kalamazoo
Grow up get married and when that one ends
We hate sleeping alone so we get married again
Don't wanna be buried in debt or in sin
So we pray to Jesus and we play the lotto
Cause there ain't but two ways
We can change tomorrow
And there ain't no genie
And there ain't no bottle
So we pray to Jesus and we play the lotto
We love to complain about what we can't fix
Mostly mothers in law traffic and politics
We tell our kids how hard it was back when
Same way our parents did to us back then
Thought we'd be different but we're just like them
Yeah we pray to Jesus and we play the lotto
Cause there ain't but two ways
We can change tomorrow
And there ain't no genie
And there ain't no bottle
So we pray to Jesus and we play the lotto
We load our kids up in our new used car
And after church we hit the mini mart
Behind the counter up there on the wall
It reads  million on the power ball
Six little numbers that could change it all
So we pray to Jesus and we play the lotto
Cause there ain't but two ways
We can change tomorrow
And there ain't no genie
And there ain't no bottle
So we pray to Jesus and we play the lotto <start> Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end
The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
Were together again
Together again
The grey skies are gone
Youre back in my arms
Now where you belong
That love we once knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters
Were together again <start> Now there you go givin' that eye
With your hand on my thigh
You got me swervin' all over the place.
You got me wantin' and needin'
You're the reason for my speedin'
And you know you can't blame it on the breaks.
Blame it on those baby blues
For lookin' like you do
Blame it on your slow dancin' county road romancin'
Blame it on the moonlight shinin' bright
Tailgate kind of summer night
Blame it on you for lovin' me so true
Girl you can blame it on your smile your whisper and your touch
Blame it on your lips for kissin' me so much
Blame it on those baby blues
But you can't blame me for lovin' you.
Yeah when the sun goes down on the sleepy little town
You turn my world into a country love song.
Take a good long look in the mirror
Naw it couldn't be any clearer
And you'll see what turns my radio on
Blame it on those baby blues
For lookin' like you do
Blame it on your slow dancin' county road romancin'
Blame it on the moonlight shinin' bright
Tailgate kind of summer night
Blame it on you for lovin' me so true
Girl you can blame it on your smile your whisper and your touch
Blame it on your lips for kissin' me so much
Blame it on those baby blues
But you can't blame me for lovin'
The way you love me
Can't get enough of me
Rain or shine all the time with all your heart and soul.
I'll be lookin' in your eyes
By the time the sunrise comes
Shinin' through your bedroom window.
You can blame it on those baby blues
For lookin' like you do
Blame it on your slow dancin' county road romancin'
Blame it on the moonlight shinin' bright
Tailgate kind of summer night
Blame it on you for lovin' me so true
Girl you can blame it on your smile your whisper and your touch
Blame it on your lips for kissin' me so much
Blame it on those baby blues
But you can't blame me for lovin' you.
No no matter what you do
Girl you can't blame me for lovin' you.
You can blame it on those baby blues
For lookin' like you do <start> I saw you sittin' there sippin' red wine down at Causen Mills
I knew you'd prob'ly be outta my league but I though what the hell
Aw what the hell
Five dollars a glass was kickin' my butt but I kept on buyin'
I kinda thought you were into me
So I kept on tryin' to get them sparks a'flyin'
In my forty dollar blue jeans
Next to a beauty queen
Used to the finer things
All I had to my name was a big ol' truck and a little ol' place
I couldn't help but think
I can't afford to love you
But I can't afford not too
Hoohoohoo
I asked you if you ever stared up at the stars from a tailgate
Down by the river with a six pack
You said no but it sure sounds great
You climbed up in my old truck
Sittin' right beside me
I cranked up a country song
And you started smilin'
Yeah this ol' boy was stylin'
In forty dollar blue jeans
Next to a beauty queen
Used to the finer things
I missed work for three days
Kissin' on you didn't get paid
I couldn't help but think
I can't afford to love you
But I can't afford not to
Hoohoohoo
We been together ever since that night
You're still in love with that same old guy
That same old guy old guy
In forty dollar blue jeans
Next to a beauty queen
Used to the finer things
Yeah we set a date for next spring
Workin' two jobs pickin' out rings
I can't help but think
I can't afford to love you
I can't afford to love you
But I can't afford not too
Hoohoohoo
I can't afford not too
Love on you <start> When I go don't cry for me
In my fathers arms I'll be
The wounds this world left on my soul
Will all be healed and I'll be whole
Sun and moon will be replaced
With the light of Jesus' face
And I will not be ashamed
For my savior knows my name
It don't matter where you bury me
I'll be home and I'll be free
It don't matter where I lay
All my tears be washed away
Gold and silver blind the eye
Temporary riches lie
Come and eat from heaven's store
Come and drink and thirst no more
So weep not for me my friend
When my time below does end
For my life belongs to him
Who will raise the dead again
It don't matter where you bury me
I'll be home and I'll be free
It don't matter where I lay
All my tears be washed away <start> Caution's in the wind
The hardest part is through
You don't have to try so hard
To make me fall for you
I've surprised myself
With what I've gone and done
Just today I heard my self
Swear you were the one
Laugh I just have to laugh
I really thought you knew
I can't believe
That you're asking me
When I will love you
I already do
I already do
You've been doing fine
Please don't change a thing
It's too good to hide away
So I might as well come clean
I didn't shout it out
But everybody knew
Funny you're the only one who didn't have a clue
Laugh I just have to laugh
I really thought you knew
I can't believe
That you're asking me
When I will love you
I already do
I already do
I gave you my heart
Can't you fell the power
You want to see the light
Baby the sun's been up for hours
Laugh I just have to laugh
I really thought you knew
I can't believe
That you're asking me
When I will love you
I already do
I already do <start> On an icy road one night a young man loses his life
They marked the shoulder with a cross
And his family gathers round on a piece of hallowed ground
Their hearts are heavy with their loss
As the tears fall from their eyes
There's one who'll always sympathize
God only cries for the living
'Cause it's the living that are left to carry on
And all the angels up in heaven
They're not grieving because they're gone
There's a smile on their faces
'Cause they're in a better place than oh they've ever known
God only cries for the living
'Cause it's the living that are so far from home
It still makes me sad when I think of my grand dad
I miss him each and every day
But I know the time will come when my own gradnson
Wonders why I went away
Maybe we're not meant to understand
Till we meet up in the Promised Land
God only cries for the living
'Cause it's the living that are left to carry on
And all the angels up in heaven
They're not grieving because they're gone
There's a smile on their faces
'Cause they're in a better place than oh they've ever known
God only cries for the living
'Cause it's the living that are so far from home
Yeah we're so far from home <start> I saw the sun set low on that skyline
Day was gone I was out of time
As I let her walk out and say goodbye
And I sat there on that street askin' why
I let her drive away....
I let her drive away....
She walked out that door threw that truck in gear
I'm standing there alone drowning in my tears
Watched the tailights as they disappeared
She was gone like I'd always feared
As I let her drive away....
I let her drive away......
I sometimes think about her and what we had
Everything about us was not that bad
Wish I had done things different then she'd have stayed
But I let her drive away.......
But I let her drive away.......
Every time I look back I can almost see
That mountain of regret overcoming me
That night she left stays in my memory
I never thought she would ever leave
And drive away.......
I let her drive away.....
I sometimes think about her and what we had
Everything about us was not that bad
Wish I had done things different then she'd have stayed
But I let her drive away.......
I let her drive away......
I sometimes think about her and what we had
Everything about us was not that bad
Wish I had done things different then she'd have stayed
But I let her drive away......
I let her drive away.......
I let her drive away....... <start> Oh when the saints go marching in when the saints go marching in

Oh when the saints...
 harmonica 
Oh when they crown him Lord of all when they crown him Lord of all
Oh Lord I want to be in that number when they crown him Lord of all
Oh when the saints... <start> I spent all my time chasing the good life
I lived so fast I ran my headlights on that road
But I'm alright
Cause I'm still here and I'm still smiling
With all my friends right here beside me
I'm not alone Yeah I'm alright
This is my life and I'm alright
Chorus
Well I was running around
living it up stead of living it down
I did it all
I did it right and I'd do it again Yeah
I'm not sad and I'm not sorry
cause I'm the one who wrote the story of my life
and I'm alright
Well I was running around
living it up stead of living it down
I did it all I did it right and I'd do it again Yeah
Well I was running around
living it up stead of living it down
I did it all I did it right and I'd do it again Yeah <start> You feel it now
But it won't last
Without a doubt
It's bound to pass
Mark my word
Mark my word
Mark my word
It's such a thrill
When love begins
But it's downhill
From here on in
Mark my word
Mark my word
Mark my word
There'll come a day
You'll leave me cold
And I'll say
I told you so
Yeah that's the way
It's gonna go
Mark my word
Make no mistake
You'll change your mind
My heart will break
Just give it time
Mark my word
Mark my word
Mark my word <start> What good is my life if I don't have you cause all of my dreams are built around you
I'd be like Miami without any sun
Without you I'm nothing without you I'm nothing together we're one
The roar of Niagara when you are near turns into a drip when you disappear
Imagine a party without any fun
Without you I'm nothing without you I'm nothing together we're one
When I'm happy oh it tickles me too
When I'm crying you know it hurts me through and through
It takes two hands to make one hold I belong to you baby body and soul
If you ever leave me and you don't come back
I'd be like a train without a railroad track
Just like a river with a no place to run
Without you I'm nothing without you I'm nothing together we're one
When I'm happy oh it tickles me too... <start> I woke up this morning something under my skin I'd love to see your face when you realize she's gone the radio playing your favourite tune  song to do with  chevrolet  female artist also Connie  <start> One day shy of  years old
Grandma passed away
I was a broken hearted little boy
Blowin' out that birthday cake
How I cried when the sky let go
With a cold and lonesome rain
Momma smiled said don't be sad child
Grandma's watchin' you today
'Cause there's holes in the floor of heaven
And her tears are pourin' down
That's how you know she's watchin'
Wishing she could be here now
And sometimes if you're lonely
Just remember she can see
There's holes in the floor of heaven
And she's watchin' over you and me
Season's come and seasons go
Nothing stays the same
I grew up fell in love
Met a girl who took my name
Year by year made a life
In this sleepy little town
I thought we'd grow old together
Lord I sure do miss her now
'Cause there's holes in the floor of heaven
And her tears are pourin' down
That's how you know she's watchin'
Wishing she could be here now
And sometimes if you're lonely
Just remember she can see
There's holes in the floor of heaven
And she's watchin' over you and me
But there's holes in the floor of heaven
And her tears are pourin' down
That's how I know she's watchin'
Wishing she could be here now
And sometimes when I'm lonely
I remember she can see
There's holes in the floor of heaven
And she's watchin' over you and me
Well my little girl is 
I walk her down the aisle
It's a shame her mom can't be here now
To see her lovely smile
They throw the rice I catch her eye
As the rain starts comin' down
She takes my hand says daddy don't be sad
'Cause I know Momma is watchin' now
And there's holes in the floor of heaven
And her tears are pourin' down
That's how you know she's watchin'
Wishin' she could be here now
And sometimes when I'm lonely
I remember she can see
Yes there's holes in the floor of heaven
And she's watchin' over you and me
Watchin' over you and me
Watchin' over you and me
Watchin' over you and me <start> I have seen your soul turn black
And then retreat
To that dark place where no one else may follow
I waited here for your returning
To roll your cigarette
And wash your bloodied feet
You have heard the silent running
Of my dreams
Broke me from the grip of grief and fever
With the sound of your voice speaking my name
And a kiss
That I will feel forever
In the hour of gold the hour of lead
WG did forge our wedding bed
On a hard and holy road
We lay down our head
In tha hour of gold the hour oi lead
I have watched you riding on
The wall of death
And when il finally breaks you and you fall
I will tear this dress of muslin that you gave me
To bind the fatal wound
And catch your last sweet breath
In the hour of gold the hour of lead
We did forge our wedding bed
On a hard and holy road
We lay down our head
In the hour of gold the hour of lead
But the world will be my witness when
They excavate my heart
And find the image of your face
Imprinted there like some Shroud of Turin
That neither time Nor tundra could erase
In the hour of gold the hour of lead
We did forge our wedding bed
On a hard and holy road
We lay down our head
In the hour of gold the hour of lead <start> That Sunday morning choir calling church doors open wide
That hallelujah shoot right through ya make you feel alive
That key under the mat you know right where it's at
It's waiting with the porch light on
Don't bother calling no need for knocking just come on home
Come on home my love is
Never gonna run dry never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God your mama and me
God your mama and me
Unconditionally
God your mama and me
Loud as shotgun angels singing with the radio
Praying with you every mile down any dead end road
You can tell me every secret that you been keeping
I'll hold it lock and key
Up with you all night holding you all night I never leave
You better believe my love is
Never gonna run dry never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God your mama and me
God your mama and me
Unconditionally
God your mama and me
You better believe it you better believe it
Every step you take I'll be as sure as your shadow
Every move you make you know I'm part of you wherever you go
Baby you know my love is
Never gonna run dry never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God your mama and me
God your mama and me
Unconditionally
God your mama and me
God your mama and me
God your mama and me
Unconditionally
God your mama and me <start> I've got the lonesome homesick blues
I've got them bad babe down in my shoes
I left someone there that I might lose
That's why I've got these old homesick blues
It makes me homesick to hear your name
And hold you dear in my arms again
I'm a gonna ride that old lonesome train
To the one I left back in Maces Spring
You told me once dear you loved me so
And it's on my mind dear every where I go
I'll soon be knowing if it is so
Or has your love for me grown cold
Oh listen to that old lonesome train
It's a gonna carry me back again
To the one that told me their love was true
I'll spend the rest of my days with you <start> The lightning express from the depot so grand
Had started out on its way
All of the passengers that were on board
Seemed to be happy and gay
But one little boy who sat by himself
Was reading a letter he had
You could plainly tell by the look on his face
That the contents of it made him sad
The stern old conductor then started his round
Taking tickets from everyone there
And finally reaching the side of the boy
He gruffly demanded his fare
I have no ticket the boy then replied
But I'll pay you back someday
Then I'll put you off at the next stop we make
But he stopped when he heard the boy say
Please Mr. Conductor
Don't put me off of this train
The best friend I have in this world sir
Is waiting for me in pain
Expecting to die any moment sir
And may not live through the day
I wanna reach home and kiss mother goodbye
Before God takes her away
A girl sitting near was heard to exclaim
If you put him off it's a shame
Taking his hand a collection she made
The boy's way was paid on the train
I'm obliged to you miss for your kindness to me
You're welcome she said never fear
Each time the conductor would pass through the car
The boy's words would ring in his ear
Please Mr. Conductor
Don't put me off of this train
The best friend I have in this world sir
Is waiting for me in pain
Expecting to die any moment sir
And may not live through the day
I wanna reach home and kiss mother goodbye
Before God takes her away
I wanna reach home and kiss mother goodbye
Before God takes her away <start> I can taste your kiss on my lips
And I'm wrapped around your finger tips
As I watch the moonlight dancing on your skin
Your green eyes and the sweet red wine
Go to my head girl every time
And I get drunk on you
I lose control and then
And here I go again
I'm falling for you even though I know you're only playing with my heart
Tomorrow might be hell
But a night or two of loving you is better than never at all
And I can't help myself
So I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Until you're gone
Girl I know you're a gypsy soul
And I'm just a stop along your road
And you hang around long enough to blow my mind
If I had a star for every scar
You tattooed on my heart
I could fill up the Oklahoma sky
So girl I don't know why
I'm falling for you even though I know you're only playing with my heart
Tomorrow might be hell
But a night or two of loving you is better than never at all
And I can't help myself
So I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Until you're gone
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Till you're gone
I look down and my cell phone rings
And I see your name and I know what that means
But I don't care
I'll just hold on
Till you're gone
Every time you need to take it home
Seeing you there just breaks my heart
But I don't care
I'll just hold on
Till you're gone
Your green eyes and that sweet red wine
Go to my head girl every time
But I don't care
I'll just hold on
Till you're gone <start> Precious Lord take my hand
Lead me on let me stand
For I am tired I am weak I am worn
Through the storms through the night
Lead me on to the light
Precious Lord take my hand and lead me home
Well I remember when I was a lad
Times were hard and things wee bad
There's a silver lining behind every cloud
Just poor people that's all we were
Trying to make a living out of outback dirt
We all get together in a circle and sing out
loud Daddy sand bass Mama sand tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singing seem to help a trouble soul
One o these days it won't be long
We'll all join in this song
We'll all get together up yonder 'round the throne
No the circle won't be broken
Bye and Bye Lord Bye and Bye
Daddy sang bass Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky Lord in the sky <start> I've been lonesome
I've been empty
I got an achin'
Way down inside
I need someone
Someone to hold me
Pull down the shade
Turn out the light
And love me tonight.
Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door.
I need you so now
Come on let's go now
Kick off your shoes
Turn out the light
And love me tonight.
Now don't you worry
We're all alone now
Let your hair down
Sit by my side
Turn off the T.V.
Put on some music
Pull down the shade
Turn out the light
And love me tonight
Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door.
I need you so now
Come on let go now
Kick off your shoes
Turn out the light
And love me tonight <start> It seems like I was there from the start
A witness to your wild and reckless heart
You showed me the way but now you're gone
Quicker than the trigger of an outlaw's gun
Living fast and dying young
A victim of this road you left me on
White line took my baby
Led him down that dark highway
Headlightblind driving crazy
If my wheels keep turning
Gonna roll that white line away
We worked the road as hard as we could drive her
But now I am the only survivor
From night to night at every place I play in
The sweetness of your song remains
I'll be the keeper of the flame
'Til every soul hears what your heart was saying
White line took my baby
Led him down that dark highway
Headlightblind driving crazy
If my wheels keep turning
Gonna roll that white line away
All the nights you spent alone
All the love I'd never shown
All the words I could not say
That white line took you away
White line took you away
I'll follow this white line down where it's winding
'Cause somewhere up ahead your light's still shining
The sound of the silver strings will guide me
I've stood and watched the bridges burn
I'm past the point of no return
Oh how I wish that you were here beside me
White line took my baby
Led him down that dark highway
Headlightblind driving crazy
If my wheels keep turning
Gonna roll that white line away
White line took my baby
Led him down that dark highway
Headlightblind driving crazy
If my wheels keep turning
Gonna roll that white line away
White line took my baby
Led him down that dark highway <start> Don't call me a fool
I know where she's been
When they turn on those lights in town
She'll go there again
There's no need in crying
You don't make the rules
I know where she's going
So don't call me a fool
Well I don't know the reason
That you seem to care
About my new heartache
Well I know it's not fair
But I'd rather hold her
Whenever I can
Than live with the lonely
Of making a stand
Don't call me a fool
I know where she's been
When they turn on those lights in town
She'll go there again
There's no need in crying
You don't make the rules
I know where she's going
So don't call me a fool
Well I guess I'll be leaving
You won't see me around
Well I hope I'll be somewhere
But I can't be found
Don't you feel guilty
For something you said
When they find my darling
With that hole in her head
Don't call me a fool
I know where she's been
When they turn on those lights in town
She'll go there again
There's no need in crying
You don't make the rules
I know where she's going
So don't call me a fool
I know where she's going
So don't call me a fool <start> I must have done something bad sometime in my life
And I paid for it time and again
But this time you've hurt me so bad I could lay down and die
And the pain grows each day ten times ten times ten.
If I thought my hand was against you why I'd cut off my arm
And I'd walk off and leave it behind
If I thought that you needed money why I'd sell my own soul
And I'd even steal from the poor and the blind.
I can't understand how ice can glitter like fire
Why you had me fooled all alone
I gave you all that I had then I searched around for more
And now I've got nothing at all and you're gone.
I must have done something bad sometime in my life
And I paid for it time and again and again <start> I knew something was the matter
It really needed my attention
And I had planned to look into it someday
But I was busy making money
I wanted you to be proud of me
Now I wish I could turn the clock back someway
I thought there was time
I never thought that you would leave me
I always thought that I could find you
Somewhere near a phone to answer when I call
Now you have my full attention
Now you're all that I can think of
This is not what I expected at all
I thought there was time
I thought there was time
Are you even on this planet
Can you see these pretty flowers
Or am I standing here just talking to the wind
How I wish that I had told you
How I wish that I had shouted
I love you I love you I love you I love you back then <start> Over and over
I've said that we are through
Over and over
I've said I'm leaving you
But when you say I love you my heart goes in a spin
And over and over I take you back again
Time and time again I've said this is the end
And told my heart forget what might have been
No matter what I'd do I can't get over you
I love you over and over again
Time and time again... <start> Well he spent that summer walkin' door to door
With a can of gas and an ol' lawn mower
That's a sure fire way to make a buck when you're fourteen
Well he made a buck with no luck at all
Then he spotted a place where the weeds were tall
With a young girl sitting on the front porch eating ice cream
Deep in the pocket of his grass stained jeans
Was some caramel corn and a plastic ring
Leftover from the week before
Momma didn't wash them thank the Lord
Just like a Cracker Jack Diamond
You never know when you're gonna find one
They found love from that day on
The hand of fate put them together
Their hearts will stay forever young
Like a Cracker Jack Diamond
Well it's been five years since he gave her his prize
Now the sparkle's gone but not in their eyes
And he's wanting to tell her what's been on his mind lately
He said Girl I ain't rich but I've been saving up
A little ever day 'til I had enough
Before he could finished she said You know I will baby
Deep in the pocket of his holy jeans
Was money for the preacher and a diamond ring
He took her back to that old front porch
Slipped it on her finger and he thank the Lord
Just like a Cracker Jack Diamond
You never know when you're gonna find one
They found love from that day on
The hand of fate put them together
Their hearts will stay forever young
Like a Cracker Jack Diamond
Now once a year she takes it out but it won't fit her hand
But she wears it in her heart
Because that's where it all began
Just like a Cracker Jack Diamond
You never know when you're gonna find one
They found love from that day on
The hand of fate put them together
Their hearts will stay forever young
Like a Cracker Jack Diamond <start> Now if you don't want me honey you don't have to stall
My love is not a plaything you will find
Now that you have nothin' with my back against the wall
Honey won't you please make up your mind
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You'll feel so blue and all alone yes you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
 fiddle  dobro 
Now where were you when I called you on the phone
And your mama said that you were not around
While I was sittin' at home all alone you're walkin' the dog all over town
You're gonna miss me...
 banjo  harmonica 
Now don't you remember when you was my honeybee
And you buzzed around the sugar all night long
Now your cheatin' heart is gonna got the best of me
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me... <start> You always find the way to hurt my pride if I'm not crying you're not satisfied
I don't know why you want to hurt me so
But if you're trying to break my heart you don't have very far to go
You don't have very far to go before the heartaches begin
I already feel the sadness of a heartbreak settin' in
You're turning down the flame of love too low
If you're trying to break my heart you don't have very far to go
 steel 
You don't have very far to go before the heartaches begin
I already feel the sadness of a heartbreak settin' in
You can't love me and still want to hurt me so
If you're trying to break my heart you don't have very far to go <start> So your conscience finally hit you
And you're feeling guilty
And you're wishing I was there
So you wanna say you're sorry
Well please forgive me if I'm too gone to care
You can take back your goodbyes
Wipe off those sad eyes
Cause I've got some tears of my own
Weather man says its gonna rain tonight
The kind of storm where the basement floods
And you lose the lights should have thought of that before
Cause I'm not your blue sky anymore
So you heard the pitterpatter of a lost heart beating
And learned what it was for
So you made a list of shoulders
That you'd be needing
Well mine aren't yours anymore
Come on show me your temper
Be the man I remember
So I won't forget what you've done
Weather man says its gonna rain tonight
The kind of storm where the basement floods
And you lose the lights should have thought of that before
Cause I'm not your blue sky anymore
don't wanna be that blue sky
I'm not your blue sky anymore <start> The prisons are empty
The homeless have houses
Nobody's hungry
Nobody''s poor
Nobody's judged by their faith or their color
Nobody's wrong in this world without war
We buried our swords
We don't fight anymore
Chorus
You can't imagine all the mountains we'd move if we loved
If we loved a little harder
Yea there's no telling all the walls we'd break through
If we loved
If we loved a little harder
Nobody's lonely used or neglected
Children are cherished from the day that they're born
Even a stranger's never a stranger
No bars on the windows
No locks on our doors
Cuz we open our doors
Not afraid anymore
Chorus
Just think of how much better off we'd be
If we open up our hearts
If we believe
You can't imagine all the mountains we'd move if we loved
If we loved a little harder
Yea there's no telling all the walls we'd break through
If we loved
If we loved a little harder
Ohhhhh
If we loved
If we loved
If we loved a little harder <start> Verse 
I feel a storm coming on and I want make it right tonight
There's a tired in your eyes I can tell you're on the verge of crying
Baby pack something warm and a couple of things you'd miss if you had to be gone for a week let's go find someplace you can disappear till this storm passes over and your sky grows clear...
Chorus
In my arms ... Pretty girl you can runaway
Get lost somewhere get stranded wait out this hurricane
A broken down motel on a beach only cash where they don't ask for names
Till you get your feet back under you baby we can live like castaways
Verse 
We can get so busy hard to tell who we are anymore
Need a long stretch of sand we can walk build a fire cuddle up warm
Lay your hair in the grass let me whisper your name
Take your mind off the crazy medicate your pain till the noise goes quiet and the chains go slack baby close your eyes its time to fall back....
Chorus
In my arms.... pretty girl you can runaway
Get lost somewhere get stranded wait out this hurricane
A little seaside town carnival closed down where nobody will look for days
Till you get your feet back under you baby let's live like castaways
Bridge
Yeah it's coming back I can see it peeking through your smoky hair
A little hint of smile in the corner of your eyes baby come over here come over here...
Chorus
In my arms ... Pretty girl you can runaway
Get lost out here under an old oak pier listen to the waves
A broken down motel on a beach only cash where they don't ask no names
Till you get your feet back under you baby we can live like castaways
Empty bottles on a beach yeah just you and me we can stay out here for days
Till you get your feet back under you baby let's live like castaways <start> I know where I come from
How 'bout you
I don't need baggy clothes
Or rings in my nose to be cool.
The scars on my knuckles
Match these scuffs on these cowboy boots.
An' there's a whole lot more like me
How 'bout you
I punch the clock tryin' to make it to the top
How 'bout you
I ain't got no blueblood trust fund
I can dip in to.
Yeah I wish Uncle Sam would give a damn
About the man who's collar's blue.
But if he don't hell I'll make it on my own
How 'bout you
An' how 'bout you
Do you feel the way I do
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few.
But that's just me
How 'bout you
I still say Yes Ma'am to my Momma
How 'bout you
If I shake your hand look you in the eye
You can bet your ass it'll be the truth.
I cover my heart with my hat
When they fly that Red White and Blue
Just like my Daddy taught me
How 'bout you
An' how 'bout you
Do you feel the way I do
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few.
But that's just me
Well how 'bout you
I like my country rockin'
How 'bout you
Just put me on a stage man
Turn it up an' I'll turn it loose.
Yeah give me a crowd that's redneck an' loud
We'll raise the roof.
Yeah I might just stay all night long.
How 'bout you
Do you feel the way I do
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few.
An' how 'bout you
Do you feel the way I do
'Cause man I know where I come from
How 'bout you <start> Darling there's a talk around town bout a girl who spreads love around
With soft lips and eyes crystal blue darling say it's not you
They say that she comes in alone and stay till self respect is gone
Then each night she leaves with someone new darling say it's not you
At first what they said didn't hurt me until they mentioned her name
Then slowly the tears overtook me cause her name and yours is the same
Each night till the breaking of dawn I'm praying that you're not the one
Tell me lies but say it's not true darling say it's not you darling say it's not you <start>  with The Family 


Oh I wanna hear that factory whistle blow just the way it used to sound before
And maybe it'll scare away the wolf that's at my door
I wanna hear that factory whistle blow

I wanna hear that factory whistle blow yeah daddy's been around the house too long <start> Come all you broken hearted come and lay your burden down
Come kings and queens come royalty surrender up your crown
Come emptyhanded come with nothing of your own to claim
Come naked poor come like a child to ride the orphan train
Chorus x
Come ride ride on the orphan train
Put your ear to the track you can hear your name
Come ride ride on the orphan train it'll take you all the way home
The way is narrow it is steep that brings you to the door
But love awaits there to embrace your heart forevermore
Come you abandoned you forsaken
Friendless and alone come refugees left homesick for
Some place you've never known
Here princes paupers criminals and saints are all the same
No more or less than God's beloved child aboard this train
Chorus x <start> We'll sing in the sunshine we'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine then I'll be on my way
I will never love you the cost of love's too dear
But though I'll never love you I'll stay with you one year
And we'll sing in the sunshine...
I'll sing to you each morning I'll kiss you every night
But darling don't cling to me I'll soon be out of sight
But we'll sing in the sunshine...
My daddy he once told me don't you love you any woman
Just take what they may give you and give but what you can
And we'll sing in the sunshine...
And when our year has ended and I have gone away
You'll often speak about me and this is what you'll say
We sang in the sunshine we laughed every day
We sang in the sunshine and I went on my way <start> I'm sitting here alone so many years have gone
And yet it seems like only yesterday
That you were by my side we laughed dear and we cried
Those memories refused to go away
There's memories that always bring me sorrow and memories I'll treasure till I die
No matter what they bring I wouldn't change a thing
I'm sitting here watching my past go by
 guitar 
There's smiling eyes of blue would love light shining through
Then like a flash those eyes seem strange and cold
The picture that I see is only meant for me just memories are locked within my soul
There's memories that always... <start> Intro G see D G
 Well there's no more smokey bars in California
There ain't no wild life left in Tennessee
But I keep on livin' every song I'm  singing
And they're tryin' to put an end to guys like  me
All that's left in Bakersfield is a  jukebox
And it's haunted by old songs and memories
It's getting hard to find a place to play my  guitar
And they're tryin' to put an end to guys like  me
Chorus
I'd  like to find a place where love surrounds me
Some  town where they don't mind me hangin' around
A  place where life don't move too fast
and  what you are is not a thing of the past
Where  you can land your dreams on solid  ground
Verse 
Well I'm  sittin' on a barstool down on  Broadway
Waitin' for my turn to sing my  dreams
I'm just a California boy with my old  guitar
And they're tryin' to put an end to guys like  me

Yeah they're  tryin' to put an end to guys like  me. <start> If I Ever Love Again

I felt a little uneasy when you walked in
But I'm glad you agreed to see me once again
If for no one's sake but mine
While I've got the chance this time
I want to tell you just what a fool I've been
There have been a lot of changes in my life
And there's a long list of wrongs I'm making right
But of all the things I've done
Hurting you is still the one
Mistake that I keep making in my dreams every night
Chorus
But if I ever love again
I know one thing for sure
That if I ever love again
It won't be like before
Cause losing you's the price I paid
To learn that love is only made to give
If I ever love again
When I think about the man I used to be
It's no wonder that you just gave up on me
But standing here today
I just want to say
It's my belief in what we had that finally set me free
Chorus
And if I ever love again
I know one thing for sure
That if I ever love again
It won't be like before
Cause losing you's the price I paid
To learn that love is only made to give
If I ever love again
If I ever love again I'll tell you honestly
I'll do my best to love her just the way that you loved me
Chorus
And if I ever love again
I promise you for sure
That if I ever love again
It won't be like before
Cause losing you's the price I paid
To learn that love is only made to give
If I ever love again
If I ever love again <start> The alarm clock woke my sleeping but I lay there for a minute
With a million cobwebs clinging to my brain
I stopped the bell from ringing in the times it takes a heartbeat
Then I settled back and closed my eyes again
I reached out for my baby for some early morning loving
Then the terrible truth came staggering through my head
There was nothing but the fragrance of her perfume on the pillow
Baby wasn't there beside me in the bed
It's the mornin' after baby let me down
It's the daybreak and the heartbreak that I found
Only silence to torment me no soft hands to touch me gently
It's the mornin' after baby let me down
There was nothing to hold on to except the sheets that fell around me
And I started into tremblin' like a leaf
How could that woman leave me she was more than just a lover
She was every bit a lady warm and sweet
I can taste the salty teardrops God it's gettin' hard to swallow
I hope a glass of bourbon can take the pain away
I got no appetite for eatin' just a sick and empty feelin'
What a good for nothing way to start the day
It's the mornin' after baby... <start> In the back of the bottom drawer
Of the dresser by our bed
Is a box of odds and ends
That I have always kept
But the man who sleeps beside me
Doesn't know it's even there
Little pieces from my past
That I shouldn't have to share
A napkin that is stained with time
Has a poem on it
That didn't quite rhyme
But it made me cry
In a Dear Jane letter
From a different guy
He broke up with me
And he told me I'm not always right
And a stolen key
From an old hotel room door
In the back of the bottom drawer
I don't keep these things
'Cause I'm longing to go back
I keep them because I wanna stay
Right where I'm at
I'm reminded of my rights and wrongs
I don't wanna mess this up
But I wouldn't know where I belong
Without this box of stuff
A birthday card from my first boyfriend
He signed it 'I love you' so I gave in
Yeah we went too far in his daddy's car
And those Mardi Gras beads from '
We danced all night stayed out so late
We thought we were stars
Closing down the bars
That champagne was cheap
But still I've got that cork
In the back of the bottom drawer
I'm not trying to hide these things
From the man I love today
But I'm a better woman for him
Thanks to my yesterday
So now I try to give more than I take
And I bite my tongue
Fight the urge to say
'It's my way or no way at all'
And now I cherish love a whole lot more
'Cause of what's
In the back of the bottom drawer <start> YOU GET TO ME
WRITER DON WILLIAMS
You get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me
You just can't believe how you get to me.
Night after night I've tried holding you tight and then I'll stay away.
I've tried holding your hand being your man and just anyway.
When it comes down to feelings it's always the same old song 
My poor hearts just reeling but you act like something's wrong.
Oh you get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me
You just can't believe how you get to me.
If I could cry bring a tear to your eye maybe that's the way.
'Cause were in the strains of living your pains from yesterday.
Really got to keep on growing looking for the brighter day.
Like the water that keeps on flowing well I just can't stay away.
You get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me
You just can't believe how you get to me.
Oh you get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me
You just can't believe how you get to me. <start> Wish that I was on ole Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top
ain't no telephone bills
Once I had a girl on Rocky Top
Half bear the other half cat
Wild as a mink sweet as soda pop
I still dream about that
Rocky top you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top
Rocky Top Tennessee Rocky Top Tennessee
Once two strangers climbed on Rocky Top
Lookin for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top
I recon' they never will
Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top
Dirts too rocky by far
that's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their fix from a jar
Rocky Top you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top
Rocky Top Tennessee Rocky Top Tennessee
Yeah I've had years of cramped up city life
Trapped like a duck in a pen
And all I know is its a pity life
can't be simple again
Rocky top you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ole rocky top
Rocky Top Tennessee Rocky Top Tennessee
Rocky Top Tennesee <start> From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
From the green old flowing mountains to the south down along the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome she's known quite well by all
The regular combination on that Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear the lonesome hobo's call
As you ramble across the country on that Wabash Cannonball
Well the eastern states are dandy most people always say
From New York to St. Louis and old Chicago by the way
To the hills of Minnesota where them rippling waters fall
No changes need be taken on that Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear the lonesome hobo's call
As you ramble across the country on that Wabash Cannonball
Here's to Daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
In the hills of Tennessee many places throughout the land
When his earthly race are over and them curtains 'round him fall
Incomprehensible him back to Dixie on that Wabash Cannonball
We came down to Nashville on a warm November day
As we rolled into that station I heard somebody say
There's a boy from Carolina they're wide and fat and tall
They came down to pick us a few they rode the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to that jingle the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear the lonesome hobo's call
As you ramble across the country on that Wabash Cannonball <start> I'm gonna change your mind
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna keep on trying
'Til I can make you love me
There's never been anything I've wanted to bad
You gotta know I'm never gonna stop 'til I have you
Baby it might sound crazy
But I'm gonna make you love me
There's a red rose
Lying on your front porch
And I left it last night
By the light of the moon
'Cause I just can't sleep
When I'm thinking 'bout my arms around you
I just gotta have you
So I'm gonna change your mind
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna keep on trying
'Til I can make you love me
There's never been anything I've wanted to bad
You gotta know I'm never gonna stop 'til I have you
Baby it might sound crazy
But I'm gonna make you love me
I slipped a love note
Under your front door
And I wrote it all straight down
Straight from my heart
Like a song in my head
That I can't stop
Singing about you
I just gotta have you
So I'm gonna change your mind
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna keep on trying
'Til I can make you love me
There's never been anything I've wanted to bad
You gotta know I'm never gonna stop 'til I have you
Baby it might sound crazy
But I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna change your mind
I'm gonna make you love me <start> If you loved me half as much as I loved you
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
You're nice to me when there's no one else around
You only build me up to let me down
If you missed me half as much as I missed you
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
I know that I would never be this blue
If you only loved me half as much as I loved you
If you loved me half as much as I loved you
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
You're nice to me when there's no one else around
You only build me up to let me down
If you missed me half as much as I missed you
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
I know that I would never be this blue
If you only loved me half as much as I loved you <start> These old boots still got a lot of ground
They ain't covered yet
There's at least another million miles
Under these old bus treads
So if you think I'm gonnna settle down
I've got news for you
I still got a lot of leavin' left to do
And as long as there's a song
Left in this old guitar
This life I'm bound to lead
Ain't for the faint of heart
So you won't fall for me
If you know what's good for you
'Cause I still got a lot of leavin' left to do
I guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So lovin' me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
Be sure that you can turn me loose
'Cause I still got a lot of leavin' left to do
Girl you look like you might be an angel
So I won't lie
I could love you like the devil
If you wanted me to tonight
And we could talk about forever for a day or two
But I still got a lot of leavin' left to do
I guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So lovin' me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
Be sure that you can turn me loose
'Cause I still got a lot of leavin' left to do
Yeah I still got a leavin' left to do <start> 
Don't make me come over there and love you
I'll be beside you in a single Bound
Don't make me come over there and love you
Cause I will right now
I dont need any explanation
Why I crave all your honey talk
Don't make me come over there and love you
'Cause it's a short walk
Chorus
You better tone down
Your persuasion
Start behaving
Before I go and fall apart
My hearts been on a long vacation
And now its beating like a ChaChaCha
Don't make me come over there and love you
'Cause I will right now
Chorus
Don't make me come over there and love you
Because it's looking like a perfect spot
Don't make me come over there and love you
And give all I got
Don't make me come over there and love you
'Cause I will right now
Yes I will right now
Don't make me come over there and love you <start> Writer Reece D. WIlson
The game was tied at seven all
She said let's take a walk
We found a place behind the stands
She said we need to talk
She went on and on about this town bein' small
And how she needed other things
Just about when they made it  to 
She gave me back my ring
Cheers went up as she broke down
She said it isn't you
I think you know how I really feel
But there's things I need to do
She said somethin' about some school down south
Where she was gonna go next fall
 to  we were winnin' again
While I was losin' it all
She lookd at me with tear filled eyes
And said I hope you realize
That this is not the way that I meant for it end
And suddenly the crowd broke through
Yellin' we've got spirit how about you
And all that I could think to do was simply join in
She said its best if we do this now
Then it began to rain
I wasn't sure if I was shakin'
From the cold or the pain
She turned away then she stopped to say
She really hoped I understood
I nodded my head as the loud speaker said
The kick is up it's good
I waited til she walked back in
Then turned my back into the wind
Before I let the tears begin to fall with the rain
I made it back in time to see
Jason throw to Bobby Lee
And make homecoming history
With a ninety yard gain
Now there's a banner hangin' down
From the stadium wall
Reminding everybody of the year we won it all
And though I was at every game I swear
One remains a memory
It was   when time ran out on me <start> We were made for each other I'm for you 
There will never be another I'll be yours eternaly
For as long as the world turns and the leaves of autumn fall
Long as there's a star in heaven I'll be waitin' for your call
We were made for each other

We were made for each other
No there will never be another I'll be yours eternaly <start> Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say Are you married
We'll say No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town.
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring ting tingling too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling Yoo hoo
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you.
Giddy yap giddy yap giddy yap
Let's go Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
Giddy yap giddy yap giddy yap
It's grand Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land.
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you. <start> When God dips his pen of love in my heart
And writes my soul a message he wants me to know
His spirit all divine fills this sinful soul of mine when God dips his love in my heart
Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a living soul
How he brought salvation when he made me whole
But I found I couldn't hide such love as Jesus did impart
Well it makes me laugh it makes me cry sets my sinful soul on fire
When God dips his love in my heart
Sometimes though the way is dreary dark and cold
And some unburdened sorrow keeps me from the goal
I go to God in prayer I can always find him there to whisper sweet peace to my soul
Well I said I wouldn't tell it...
He walked every step up calvary's ragged way
To give his life completely and bring a better day
My life was steeped and sinned but in love he took me in
His blood washed away every stain
Well I said I wouldn't tell it...
When God dips his love in my heart <start> I went to the crossroads
Fell down on my knee
I asked the Lord above me for mercy
Save Bob if you please
Standing standing on the crossroad
Yeah I try to flag a ride
Don't nobody seem to know me
Just everybody passing me by
I went down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knee
I asked the Lord above me for mercy
Save Bob if you please
Standing standing on the crossroad
I try to flag a ride
Don't nobody seem to know me
Just everybody passing me by <start> Drop raindrop fallin' from the sky like magic
Can ya feel it in the air
Drop you oughta drop on by 'cause it's warm inside
And there's a storm out there
I'll drop another log on to the fire
Get the flame a little higher
Til it feels just right
And I'll drop a blanket on the floor
There's some wine I'm gonna pour
And pull the shades down tight
Ain't nowhere you need to be
Then wrapped up here with me
I'll turn the lights down way down low
You let that dress drop nice and slow
Girl I know it's true
You know just what to do
To make me drop everything for you
Drop your hair down your shoulders
Get a little closer 'cause it's that kinda day
I'll drop drop the needle on the record
The one that makes ya wanna love the night away
Ain't nowhere you need to be
Then wrapped up here with me
I'll turn the lights down way down low
You let that dress drop nice and slow
Girl you know it's true
You know just what to do
To make me drop everything for you
Ain't nowhere you need to be
Then wrapped up here with me
I'll turn the lights down way down low
You let that dress drop nice and slow
Girl I know it's true
You know just what to do
To make me drop everything for you
Come on drop drop everything for you
You make me wanna drop drop drop drop drop
Yeah drop everything for you
Drop drop drop drop drop
Drop everything for you <start> Did you see the movie is over
I guess we missed the last half
Layin' here in this bed together
Me kissin' you you kissin' me back
It's getting late can't you see
I should get up and leave
If I don't you know where it's goin'
But you're givin' me that look baby
That says you're up to no good maybe
And you're whispering into my neck
Leavin' thoughts inside my head
Well now since you put it that way
If I need to I'll go darlin'
But what if I stay
What if I stay
Here comes the sun through the window
Feels like we just got to sleep
But the way you look on that pillow
Don'tcha know it's killin' me yeah
It's gettin' early can't you see
I should get up and leave
If I don't you know where it's goin'
But you're givin' me that look baby
That says you're up to no good maybe
And you're whispering into my neck
Leavin' thoughts inside my head
Well now since you put it that way
If I need to I'll go darlin'
But what if I stay wrapped up in your arms
'Cause lovin' you baby's been pretty perfect so far <start> Like the ancient Roman empire this world is doin' to fall
And it's much too bigger thing for mortal men
Just take a look around and see the writing on the wall
Somehow we've got to find a helping hand
This world has never been in the awful shape it's in
And people scorn the things our leaders do
It's time the prayer was spoken from the heart of every man
Jesus take a hold and lead us through
The mighty roar of gunfire is now a local sound
And our city streets are filled with angry men
Love is now a mockery throughout our troubled land
And destruction seems to be the current trend
This world has never been in the awful shape it's in
Our leaders seem in doubt of what to do
It's time the prayer was spoken from the heart of every man
Oh Jesus take a hold and lead us through Jesus take a hold and lead us through <start> From the dimness of night I have awakened to my vanity
Oh why have I all these years suffered this insanity
Thank God I can feel you really live inside me
I'm in love I'm in love
Oh the first and the last and the only time
I've ever been born again and the cold is finally severed
I am free to begin the beginning of forever
I'm in love I'm in love
I'm in love I'm in love and I know I know I know
I know it you're the angel of life
You have sung the sea and grown it
For the rest of my life I can never keep from glowing
I'm in love I'm in love
I'm in love I'm in love and I know I know I know
I know it you're the angel of life
You have sung the sea and grown it
For the rest of my life I can never keep from glowing
I'm in love I'm in love
I'm in love I'm in love <start> 
Mama it's so good to be back home again
I'm so proud to see that you are looking well
Yes I know that I look a little weary
Oh but Mama I have been through living hell
You know how much I've always loved him Mama
But he done things to me I couldn't understand
Why he made me watch him love another woman
And he tried to make me love another man
Mama can I be your little girl again
I need you now even more than I did then
And I need a lot of love and understanding
And a lot of time to get me over him
If I lose my mind Mama I wanna be here with you
Have them lock me up and see I have good care
But I just couldn't stand his torture any longer
I was afraid of what I'd do if I stayed there <start> Sadness just makes me sigh
I've come to say goodbye
Altho' I go I've got those farewell blues.
Those farewell blues make me yearn
That parting kiss seems to burn.
Farewell dearie Someday I will return.
Dreaming of you is sweet
Someday again we'll meet. <start> Uh uh

Glory in the highes I will shout and sing standing on the promises of God
Standing  standing 
Standing on the promises of God my Saviour
Standing standing I'm standing on the promises of God
Standing on the promises that cannot fail
Though the howling storm of doubt and fear assail
By the living word of God I shall prevail standing on the promises of God
Standing ...
Standing on the promises I cannot fall listening every moment to the spirits call
Resting in my Saviour as my all in all standing on the promises of God
Standing ... <start> Early in the afternoon
Is the only time my mind is clear
To think of you and the love we knew
It's a memory I hold so dear
Now we're apart I've got a broken heart
The tears fall so sincere
I know it's wrong but before too long
It's gonna be whiskey and beer
Last call for alcohol still ringin' in my head
You must've ordered two more double shots
From the shape that you're in
There ain't no stoppin' my bar hoppin'
I should've stayed home instead
Last call for alcohol still ringin' in my head
You've got to stop the way you're living
You better change your short life ways
Smokin' drinkin' and lovin'
You're just numberin' your days
Though I know what I need to do
If I could just turn around today
But her memory catches up with me
And this bar stool's where I'll stay
Last call for alcohol still ringin' in my head
You must've ordered two more double shots
From the shape that you're in
There ain't no stoppin' my bar hoppin'
I should've stayed home instead
Last call for alcohol still ringin' in my head
Last call for alcohol still ringin' in my head
You must've ordered two more double shots
From the shape that you're in
There ain't no stoppin' my bar hoppin'
I should've stayed home instead
Last call for alcohol still ringin' in my head
Last call for alcohol still ringin' in my head <start> I know what it means to be lonesome
And I know what it means to be blue
I know what it means to be lonesome in dreams
When there is no one at home for you
Well my baby left me this morning
As the clock was striking four
The sweet smiling face of my darling
I may never see any more
Well I've cried and I've cried since we parted
No one knows what I have been through
You know I'd give all I own just to have you back home
I'm lonesome lonesome for you <start> Well all the boys are talkin' 'bout your brand new car
Drivin' the girls crazy like a movie star
They say it's shiny black and really sexy
Baby don't you know by now that stuff don't impress me
I don't need four in the floor three little words will do
If you want to get next to me well Come here you
Come here you
Hey you can come on over here
Come here you
I'm ready willing and able my dear
Come here you
Well who do you think I'm talkin' to
Come here you
Well a girl like me needs verbal stimulation
When we're down to the final negotiations
I'm not puttin' on airs I'm just tellin' it straight
I feel an urgent need for us to incorporate
Don't need Kreskin here to tell us just what we're gonna do
Hey pay attention boy I'm talkin' to you
Now come here you I love to watch ya walk that walk
Come here you I love to hear you talk that talk
Come here you do everything I tell you to
Now come here you
I must admit at times I may be overzealous
But I've been tryin' out some things mothers never tell us
Girls I'm here to testify to each and every one of you
Every sin that's been committed your little mamma did it too
Oh I'm sorry little darlin' look how you drive me to distraction
Now let's get back down to business how's about a little action
Now come here you
Hey you come on over here
Come here you tell me what's a girl gotta do
Come here you I love to watch you walk that walk
Come here you I love to hear you talk that talk
Come here you do everything I tell you to <start> Can I love you more
Than I do right now

Could it be forever

Yeah <start> I've been a waiter a roofer a clerk
I've shoveled manure till my pride hurt.
When you're starting out it's all part of the work
To do what I do.
I've been evicted for not making rent
Made my Daddy wonder where my good sense went.
For the price of a dream my years have been spent
To do what I do.
So I stand here tonight with this six string guitar
To be something I've always been in my heart.
Just for the chance to play you my song
The thrill when I hear you singing along.
It's been worth everything I've been through
To do what I do.
I've played for empty tables and chairs
The drunks that don't listen the crowds that don't care.
Been told countless times Boy you ain't goin' nowhere
To do what I do.
So I hope the critics and skeptics alike
All bought a ticket to this show tonight.
And they'll see firsthand that I have survived
And what doesn't kill you makes you more alive.
And I'm one of the fortunate few
To do what I do.
There's so much joy this music can bring
So I count my blessings when I step up to sing.
Cause they're so many people who would give anything
To do what I do.
And I thank you.
I can do what I do <start> Out of all the hearts you've known and could have chosen
The blessings of your love surrounded me
For me the door of love had long been closing
If not for you I'd still be searching for my dreams
Thank you for loving me from the bottom of my heart
Thank you for loving me thank you sweetheart
Thank you for loving me and for being what you are
Thank you for loving me thank you sweetheart
I've memorized a million things to tell you
But words can't tell what feelings want to say
True love only beckons to a precious few
And when it moves into your heart it never strays
Thank you for loving me
Thank you for loving me thank you sweetheart <start> Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Christ by highest heaven adored
Christ the everlasting Lord
Late in time behold him come
Offspring of the Virgin's womb
Hail the Flesh the God Head see
Hail the incarnate Deity
Pleased as man with man to dwell
Jesus our Emmanuel
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Hail the Heavenborn Prince of Peace
Hail the Son of Righteousness
Light and life to all He brings
Risen with healing in His wings
Mild He lays His Glory by
Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King <start> I don't get along
With people who aren't kind
I don't get along
With folks with only money on their minds
And I don't get along with someone
Who's always trying to tell me what to do
But on and on
I get along with you
Well I don't like
People always tellin' me that I should change
They get simple lives
and they think they've got my life to rearrange
But they don't understand
Exactly what love boils down to
Cause on and on
I get along with you
Well all it takes to please me
Is waking in the morning feeling you by my side
And all I ever needed
Is knowin' that I'm needed in your life
I may not do
All the things that other people want me to
But on and on
I'll get along with you.
Yeah on and on
I'll get along with you. <start> I signed the paper she signed below me
The judge said Married she said Hold me
Church bells started as we departed
Straight into life we sailed just like a fairy tale
Hopefully heartache
I signed the paper she signed beside me
The bank said Good luck she said Provide me
I gave it all I had still it turned out bad
Little games of cat and mouse
And simply playing house ain't that sad
Pitty all the puzzle didn't fit
It wasn't me it wasn't her
It was life that somehow up and quit
I signed the paper she signed without me
The judge said Over as darkness found me
Standing on the street while lying with my feet
All our dreams and plans nothing in my hands
Except the paper <start> Like a child with a toy I was your plaything
But it filled my heart with joy to be your plaything
Everybody knows how the story goes you took your little toy and broke its heart strings
Like a little bitty boy loves his mother I needed you and could love no other
Now that I've lost you to somebody new look at your little toy your broken plaything
You just used me as you needed me the toy that you could leave easily
I was toloveyou all the time while your heart never was tobemine
Like a child with a toy
You just used me
And like a child with a toy <start> A drift of wild turkeys
In the field across the way.
I'm standing staring waiting
For those coyotes to make a play
But they never do.
So I move on.
A pack of wild children
In the field across the street
I'm standing staring waiting
For the bell to set them free
But it never does.
So I move on.
 years a child upon the Earth
Trying to find the answers
Without digging in the dirt
So I'll never know.
And I'll move on. <start> Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow Let it snow Let it snow
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow Let it snow Let it snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow Let it snow Let it snow <start> Last night I dreamt
That somebody loved me
No hope no harm
Just another false alarm
Last night I felt
Real arms around me
No hope no harm
Just another false alarm
So tell me how long
Before the last one 
And tell me how long
Before the right one 
The story is old I know
But it goes on
The story is old I know
But it goes on <start> While you study stars
During the night
Telescopic
During the night
Telescopic
And laughing out to the street
When they come from the bars
There in the night
Telescopic
And laughing out to the street <start> She stepped out of the Taxi with a suitcase in her hand
And a hand bag too full for her to hold
I felt her body tremble as I took her in my arms
And she whispered don't ever let me go
Chorus
The I watched her hang her dresses up and close the closet door
And I watched her put her satin things away
Somehow now I know she won't be leaving anymore
I do believe forever's here to stay
It's good to hear her foot steps just walking down the hall
Lord I wondered would I hear those sounds again
We're picking up the pieces and putting away the past
We've got a lot of broken dreams to mend
Chorus <start> I ain't nothin' but a simple man
They call me a redneck I reckon that I am
But there's things going on
That make me mad down to the core.
I have to work like a dog to make ends meet
There's crooked politicians and crime in the street
And I'm madder'n hell and I ain't gonna take it no more.
We tell our kids to just say no
Then some panty waist judge lets a drug dealer go
Slaps him on the wrist and then he turns him back out on the town.
Now if I had my way with people sellin' dope
I'd take a big tall tree and a short piece of rope
I'd hang 'em up high and let 'em swing 'til the sun goes down
Well you know what's wrong with the world today
People done gone and put their Bible's away
They're living by the law of the jungle not the law of the land
The good book says it so I know it's the truth
An eye for and eye and a tooth for a tooth
You better watch where you go and remember where you been
That's the way I see it I'm a Simple Man.
Now I'm the kinda man that'd not harm a mouse
But if I catch somebody breakin in my house
I've got twelve gauge shotgun waiting on the other side
So don't go pushing me against my will
I don't want to have to fight you but I dern sure will
So if you don't want trouble then you'd better just pass me on by
As far as I'm concerned there ain't no excuse
For the raping and the killing and the child abuse
And I've got a way to put an end to all that mess
Just take them rascals out in the swamp
Put 'em on their knees and tie 'em to a stump
Let the rattlers and the bugs and the alligators do the rest
You know what's wrong with the world today
People done gone and put their Bible's away
They're living by the law of the jungle not the law of the land
The Good Book says it so I know it's the truth
An eye for and eye and a tooth for a tooth
You better watch where you go and remember where you been
That's the way I see it I'm a simple man <start> Chorus
Oh the wayward wind is a restless wind
A restless wind that yearns to wander
And he was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind
In a lonely shack by a railroad track
He spent his younger days
And I guess the sound of the outward bound
Made him a slave to his wanderin' ways
Chorus
Oh I met him there in a border town
He vowed we'd never part
Tho' he tried his best to settle down
Now I'm alone with a broken heart
Chorus
The next of kin to the wayward wind <start> Looking back over my life I can see where I caused you strife
But I know oh yes I know I'd never make that same mistake again
Looking back over my deeds I can see signs of wise girl heeds
But if I just have a chance I'd never make that same mistake again
Once my cup was overflowing but I gave nothing in return
Now I can begin to tell you what a lesson I have learned
Looking back over the slate I can see love turn to hate
But I know oh yes I know I'll never make that same mistake again
Once my cup was overflowing <start> I'll look over things you do because I love you so
I'll be standing on the sideline while you play
Oh it hurts to see you stare at every girl you see
But I'll look over you if you'll just let me stay
It's no fault of yours if I can't give the thrill you need
But I know someday you'll find someone who can
Oh it hurts to see you stare at every girl you see
But I'll look over you and try to understand
I'll look over things you do...
I'll look over you if you'll just let me stay <start> You tell me you love her with all of your heart
And there's no room left there for me
But someday if she'll hurt you and your whole world falls apart
I'll take a left over corner of your heart
Just a left over corner of a heart not much as true
But it just goes to show how much I want you
For I'd give my heart full of true love for tiny little start
In that left over corner of your heart
 strings 
Just a left over corner... <start> When I looked out today
And saw that the sky was gray
I thought about the way
You loved days like this
And driving into town
It really started coming down
Bringing me back around
To all that I miss
It feels like it's raining you
It feels like its rainin you
I didn't even run inside
Or worry about staying dry
Besides there's nowhere I can hide
These feeling now. Running down my face
Takes me to another place
I can't think of a better way to drown
It feels like its raining you
I can't explain it. But i am baptized anew
It feels like its raining you and
If i had my way. It would do the this every day
I would never see the sun. Because the closest i get
To holding you again is ever time that sky opens up
It feels like its raining you I can't explain it
But I am baptized anew. It feels like its raining you
It feels like its raining you <start> at a small caf
in a big city
sits a man
with his life in his hands
watch the nod of his head
his eyes heavy lidded
cause
the world turns
the world it turns
the world turns on a dime
there's a girl
with a smile
on a boat
with her brother
sailing for a visit of a year
she says goodbye to her home
and all things familiar
cause
the world turns
the world it turns
the world turns on a dime
take the train
back and forth
over the border
with suitcases piled overhead
will the officer scowl
and stop before passing
will he stop before passing
the world turns
the world it turns
the world turns on a dime
the world turns on a dime <start> Railroad steamboat river and cannal yonder comes a sucker and he's got my girl
And she's gone gone gone and she's gone gone gone and I'll bid her my last farewell
I fell in love with a pretty little thing I thought that wedding bells would ring
She was as sweet as she could be till I found out what she did to me
Railroad steamboat...
 guitar 
Now I won't cry my life away some other sucker will have to pay
And when he finds that she is gone I bet I'll hear him sing this song
Railroad steamboat... <start> I bend I don't break
If I want I just take.
If I cut I bleed
If I bleed I don't cry
Don't cry don't cry.
I cry for love
I cry for love
If I fall I get up
Am I tough tough enough
For I bend I don't break
If I want I just take.
If I cut I bleed
If I bleed I don't cry
Don't cry I don't cry
I don't cry don't cry.
I cry for love
I cry for love
Want some of this
Want some of that
Some of what
Where it's at.
If I fall I get up
Am I tough tough enough
For I bend I don't break
If I want I just take.
If I cut I bleed
If I bleed I don't cry
Don't cry I don't cry
I don't cry don't cry.
I cry for love
I cry for love
I cry for love
I cry for love <start> First the tide rushes in
Plants a kiss on the shore
Then goes out to sea
And the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side
Like the oncoming tide
With one burning thought
Will your arms open wide
At last we're face to face
And as we kiss through an embrace
I can tell I can feel you are loved
You are really really mine
In the rain in the dark in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb
I'm at peace in the web
Of your heart's arms
Of your arms <start> This track is an instrumental and has no lyrics. <start> I gave up cigarettes haven't had to light one yet.
It's been a year sense I stopped.
Same goes for alcohol.
I don't touch the stuff at all.
I used to drink till I dropped.
CHORUS
But those were tough this is easy and it feels
So good to say. Forgetting you is not that hard to do
For I've done it a thousand times a day. Oh I've done it a
Thousand times a day.
Friends said it would take some time to get you off my mind.
Some said I'd never let you go. But I guess I've proved
Them wrong. One more bad habit gone.
Just like the whiskey and the smokes.
But those were tough this is easy and I'm
All right I'm ok.
Forgetting

I've given you up for good just like I said I would.
Oh the night you walked away.
But that was tough this is easy
 <start> Hurry up now turn the water into coffee
Is it there are you here
Did you just wake up
Did you just fuck up
Indulge my tug. and yer outside upon the ground
I'll speak to you
Just write it down
Just write it down
Jenny brown sweet beak
Do you need to steal
Heres a pistol if you do.
We all have got problems
All night and day
Shoot the wall leave the bird alone
Or feed that bird the worm's song
I'll sing to you
Just write it down
Jenny brown sweet beak <start> Bruma creo recordar
En un lago igual que oscuro cristal
Velas todo alrededor y en una barca que cruzo
En lago un hombre fantasmal.
T eras sombra en las sombras
Tu oculto una vez ms

Diabla
Cotilla mala pandora
Cruel demonio solo esto queras tu ver.
Bruja Dalila falsa y traidora
Di boa innoble libre ya jams podrs ser.
Diabla bruja.
Amiga mi rostro no te atreveras tu ni a pensar en mi
Que con el cielo soando estoy y preso soy
Del infierno solo aqu solo aqu.
Oh Christine
Pierde ya el temor podrs as al hombre amar venciendo al monstruo al fin
Al adefesio tu bestia ruin que suea con la belleza solo aqu solo aqu.
Oh Christine

Ven debemos regresar esos dos necios que dirigen mi teatro te echaran en falta. <start> I've been waiting for some time
for the sidewalk to come alive
I've got good days and sleepless nights
'cause you and me got lost in time
I was praying for a sign for the tides
to begin to unwind
I was splayed out among the pines
when you and me got lost in time
I've been trying to change my life
I've been trying to do what's right
but my idiot heart won't oblige
and I'll I'll try I'll try
oh wake me up lay me down
oh wake me up lay me down
oh wake me up lay me down
oh wake me up lay me down
oh wake me up lay me down
oh wake me up lay me down
oh wake me up lay me down <start> Was the captain of the team his senior year
In his eyes on his helmet he had no fear
Down by a sixball on the ten
Said huddle up boys we've got a game to win
He snapped the ball he looked left and right
Nobody was open so he tucked in tight
And before them boys hanging on to him
The clock ran out as he ran it in
And the whole town cheered
And his mama cried
And they rushed downfield
And they raised him high
Got his picture in the paper and the headline read
AllAmerican Comeback Kid
He was recruited by the best schools in the land
He decided he would sign with his Uncle Sam
Kissed his mama goodbye in their living room
Said dad don't worry I'll be home soon
And the whole town cheered
And his mama cried
And they lined the street
Just to say goodbye
Got his picture in the paper and the headline read
Come Back AllAmerican Kid
Three tours of duty and a silver star
They brought him back home with his battle scars
He stopped off the plane in his combat boots
And he saluted the red the white and blue
And the whole town cheered
And his mama cried
Another hometown boy
Made it home alive
Got his picture in the paper and the headline read
Welcome Back AllAmerican Kid
Yeah this song is for those who never did
Come back allAmerican kids <start> I saw a man today who said he talked to you not so long ago I think a month or two
And my mind raced back in time I prayed oh Lord don't let it show
He thinks I forgot you fifteen years ago
Fifteen years ago and I still feel the same why did he have to mention your name
I'm as broken up inside as though it's been a week or so
Makes a mighty strong love to keep a man thinking of a girl
He hasn't seen since fifteen years ago
 steel 
I've got a lovely wife who thinks the world of me
Promised her my love through all eternity
I've tried hard to make her happy and so far she doesn't know
I can't shake this thing of fifteen years ago
Fifteen years ago and I still feel the same why did he have to mention your name
I'm as broken up inside as though it's been a week or so
Takes a mighty long time to get a real love off your mind I know
Because I've tried since fifteen years ago
I know I've tried since fifteen years ago <start> I wonder if this blade ran through someone's side
The blood wiped away to hide
How evil you grandfather was 'fore he died
But war can make monsters out of us all
I'm sure I'd become one if I was called
And then it would be my blade
Here at this yardsale
The guitar I am holding is way out of tune
The neck it is warped and the saddle is through
I wonder if sweet music ever was played
From the hands of a boy to a girl in the shade
From this rickety ghost of a song
Here at this yardsale
A dollar for anything here on this quilt
A price tag for hands from which all things are built
A blanket of voices speak pleasure in shame
Flowers of plastic and fruit of the same
A basket of nothing at all
Here at this yardsale
So if I had the money I'd buy everything
And cover the whole lot with good gasoline
And burn it for all that I care for the past
And rid mother earth of what never should last
And give her the present of ash
Made of a yardsale <start> I'm a lone country mile from bein' style
Dirty hat an cowboy boots
I cut my teeth on them old outlaw songs
My daddy used to listen to
Guess it's in my genes
I gotta be me
Yeah I say what I think
But sometimes I drink
And when I do I drink too much
Wind up on my back
Eye shinin' black
And I know it's all because bad as it might be
Hey I gotta be me
You can wine me up an dine me
You can polish up an shine me but the real things gonna shine through
It ain't always pretty but the cowboy in me
Couldn't change if he wanted to
Yeah I had a girl her name was Pearl
I think she's up in Arkansaw
She raised her voice and gave me a choice
'Tween singin' in a Honkeytonk or JOB
As u can see I gotta be me
Yeah you can wine me up an dine me
You can polish up an shine me but the real things gonna shine through
It ain't always pretty but the cowboy in me
Couldn't change if he wanted to <start> In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
With an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved ones so
In the early morning rain with no place to go
Out on runway No  big  set to go
But I'm standin' on the grass where the cold winds blow
Where the liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
There she goes my friend she's a rolling now at last
Hear the mighty engines roar see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shine
She'll be flying o'er my home in about three hours time
This old airport's got me down it's no earthly good to me
Cause I'm stuck here on the ground as cold and drunk as I can be
You can't jump a big jet plane like you can an old freight train
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain <start> These boots have counted off many a band
Playing one night roadhouse stands
For tips in empty rooms
These boots have stood toetotoe
With the biggest baddest Joes
Like they had some things to prove
These boots
Yeah these boots more than once have saved my ass
Like the time they hid that grass
From those cops in Tupelo
And these boots have danced with the devil
And nearly lost that battle
To a wildeyed Irish Rose
I've worn out more souls than I can recount
Done more stupid things than most would dare to
I've kicked myself more times than not
For the roads they led me down
But the damnedest thing I've ever seen them do
Is walkin' out on you.
These boots had to see California
And an Arizona morning where God paints the sky
And these boots had to spur that beast in Cheyenne
Thought that bull'd make me a real man
I still drag that leg sometimes
I've worn out more souls than I can recount
Done more stupid things than most would dare to
I've kicked myself more times than not
For the roads they led me down
But the damnedest thing I've ever seen them do
Is walkin' out on you.
Now these boots are one step from the door
They walked out of years before
I can almost see her now
These boots ought to kick that door aside
Stomp out my foolish pride
But they just turn around
Damn these boots
Damn these boots
These boots <start> When it's low beams long stretch of highway
When the lonesome hits like a tidal wave
Tossing and turning tangled with my demons
Making me doubt everything I believe in
There you are
Like a stained glass sunday morning
Baby you light it up
Shot some faith on my darkest places
Like a rising sun
Filled my heart with a million amazing graces
Your voice is like a choir
A match that starts a fire
Deep down in my bones where only you can go
When my soul needs an angel's touch
Yeah you light it up
I used to get no Mona whiskey remedy
But then your spirit poured in like a symphony
And now I know that all I need is you girl
'Cause when I get lost in this crazy world
Yeah you light it up
Shot some faith on my darkest places
Like a rising sun
Filled my heart with a million amazing graces
Your voice is like a choir
A match that starts a fire
Deep down in my bones where only you can go
When my soul needs an angel's touch
You light it up
There you are like a stained glass sunday morning
You bid the dark
With all your truth and all your glory
You light it up
Shot some faith on my darkest places
Like a rising sun
Filled my heart with a million amazing graces
Your voice is like a choir
A match that starts a fire
Deep down in my bones where only you can go
When my soul needs an angel's touch
You light it up <start> Oooo
I knew this was a dream
I suddenly awoke
I wonder if they could see
The world is watching me
Got to keep moving
Got to keep moving on

Got to keep moving
Got to keep moving on
Youll see
I hit a bump in the road 
It's shakin' thoughts in my soul
I'll keep my guilty hands clean from now on 
The world is watching me
Got to keep moving
Got to keep moving on

Got to keep moving
Got to keep moving on
You'll see
Whatever good may be
I make it up as I go
A leading role in a silent movie
The world is watching me
Got to keep moving
Got to keep moving on

Got to keep moving
Got to keep moving on
You'll see
Got to keep moving
Got to keep moving on

Got to keep moving
Got to keep moving on
You'll see <start> Here I am all worn down to the muscle the bone
Done all I can
Seems like everything I do turns into don't
Still I stand still I try
And I know I'm gonna get it wrong it's alright
When the wheels come off
And somewhere between the shoulder and the ditch
Neither found nor lost
And I can't say I'll ever know which is which
There's a road and so I drive
And I know I'm gonna get it wrong it's alright
It's alright it's alright
It's alright if I find a thousand ways
Just to fall from grace
Got a true blue heart
But every now and then it must get beat
And if it falls apart
And shatters like a whiskey glass around my feet
Pick it up one more time
And I know I'm gonna get it wrong
Yeah I know I'm gonna get it wrong it's alright <start> It's a fairytale morning the ocean looks turquoise
As if it was painted that way
The waves how they rush from the shore or the island
It carries my vision away
The sun seems to blind that part of my mind
That's searching for yesterday's rhymes
It's the first day of something
And I wonder if it could be love
She lays there and tosses her head on the pillow
She peeks from the blanket to see
She looks like a child but acts like a woman
Whenever she reaches for me
Her touch burns my skin and that makes me frightened
She looks like a photograph there
Its the first day of something
And I wonder if it could be love
Yes it's hard to believe I spent all this time here alone
Trying to forget the heartaches that broke up our home
Now they're gone
Why she's seen it all from the start to the fall
She knew I'd need some place to hide
My wife she had taking the baby and left me
With all of this hatred inside
She's been my friend she helped me get over
And now that I'm better I see
The first day of something
And I wonder if it could be love <start> Well I'm shamemeless when it comes to loving you
I'll do anything you want me to
I'll do anything at all
And I'm standing here for all the world to see
Oh baby that's what's left of me
Don't have very far to fall
You know now I'm not a man who's ever been
Insecure about the world I've been livin' in
I don't break easy I have my pride
But if you need to be satisfied
I'm shameless oh honey I don't have a prayer
Every time I see you standin' there
I go down upon my knees
And I'm changin' swore I'd never compromise
Oh but you convinced me otherwise
I'll do anything you please
You see in all my life I've never found
What I couldn't resist what I couldn't turn down
I could walk away from anyone I ever knew
But I can't walk away from you
I have never let anything have this much control over me
I work too hard to call my life my own
And I've made myself a world and it's worked so perfectly
But it's your world now I can't refuse
I've never had so much to lose
Oh I'm shameless
You know it should be easy for a man who's strong
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong
I've never lost anything I've ever missed
But I've never been in love like this
It's out of my hands
I'm shameless I don't have the power now
I don't want it anyhow
So I got to let it go
Oh I'm shameless shameless as a man can be
You make a total fool of me
I just wanted to you to know
Oh I'm shameless
I just wanted you to know
Oh I'm shameless
Oh I'm down on my knees...shameless <start> Well after all these years of running 'round
Always flying high and fallin' down
I gotta get back to the way I was
Gonna turn it all 'round just because
And everybody's talkin' about the shape I'm in
They say boy you ain't a poet just a drunk with a band.
All over and over again and again
Lord they don't know about the places I've been
It gets hard out here
I know it don't look it
I used to have heart but the highway took it
The game was right but the deal was crooked
Lord I'll make it perfectly clear it gets hard out here
I guess there must be something I'm missing
My momma told me I should've gone into easy listenin'
Going with the band 'cause I thought it was cool
Oh good Lord I should've gone back to school
Oh pretty darlin' it'll be okay
You know one of these days I'm gonna take you away
She said oh sweet daddy you're probably right
You know we might get lucky but it won't be tonight
It gets hard out here
I know it don't look it
I used to have heart but the highway took it
The game was right but the deal was crooked
Lord I'll make it perfectly clear it gets hard out here
I know it don't seem it
I said I tried but I never did mean it
Nobody's listening so we mine as well scream it
Oh God we're all outta beer
It gets hard out here <start> Here she comes look at her roll there she goes eatin' that coal
Watch her fly huggin' the rails let her by by by it's the fireball mail
Let her go look at her steam hear her blow whistle and scream
Like a hound a waggin' his tail Dallas bound bound boud it's the fireball mail
Engineer makin' up time tracks are clear look at her climb
See that freight clearin' the rail bet she's late late late it's the fireball mail
Watch her swerve look at her sway get that curve out of the way
Watch her fly look at her sail let her by by by that's the fireball mail
Now here she comes look at her roll there she goes eatin' that coal
Watch her fly huggin' the rails let her by by by the fireball mail
Let her by by by the fireball mail <start> Hey hey I'm lookin' at you
Boy I gotta tell you I'm liking the view
Scuff up those shiny boots
C'mon
Hey hey I'm talking to you
With your tight tshirt and something to prove
Step up show me your moves
C'mon
Worked hard all week
Gotta whole lotta girls in a little backseat
Touch up my face
It's ladies night and we get in free
Boys are gonna hunt
Girls are gonna play and say
Hey hey I'm lookin' at you
Boy I gotta tell you I'm liking the view
Scuff up those shiny boots
C'mon
Hey hey I'm talking to you
With your tight tshirt and something to prove
Step up show me your moves
C'mon
One more two step
Slide a little closer we ain't done yet
Rock on all night
Take a trip to the country with me and my friends
Boys are gonna hunt
Girls are gonna play and say
Hey hey I'm lookin' at you
Boy I gotta tell you I'm liking the view
Scuff up those shiny boots
C'mon
Hey hey I'm talking to you
With your tight tshirt and something to prove
Step up show me your moves

Hey hey I'm lookin' at you
Boy I gotta tell you I'm liking the view
Scuff up those shiny boots
C'mon
Hey hey I'm talking to you
With your tight tshirt and something to prove
Step up show me your moves
C'mon <start> My love stands before the open window
Staring so far away
He can almost feel the southern wind blow
Almost touching my restless days
He turns from the window to me
Sad smile his apology
Sad eyes reaching for the door
Daylight loses to another evening
And still he spares me the word goodbye
He sits alone beside me fighting his feelings
He struggles to speak but in the end I only cry
Suddenly it's so hard to find
The words that would help me speak my troubled mind
He's offering these to me as if to be kind
There is a train everyday leaving either way
There is a train everyday leaving either way
There is a world you know
And there is a way to go
And we'll soon be gone it's just as well
This is my opening farewell
A child's drawing is on the table
A woman's silk lying on the floor
And he would keep me here if I were able
And lock us safe behind this open door
But suddenly it's so clear to me
I've asked him to see what he may never see
Now his kind words find their way back to me
There is a train everyday leaving either way
There is a world you know
And there is a way to go
And we'll soon be gone it's just as well
This is my opening farewell <start> Oh carry me back to the lone prairie
Where the coyotes howl and the wind blows free
And when I die you can bury me
Neath the western skies on the lone prairie
I'm a roving cowboy far away from home
Far from the prairie where I used to roam
Where the doggies wander and the wind blows free
Thought my heart is yonder on the lone prairie
Oh carry me back to the lone prairie... <start> This old house is falling down around my ears
I'm drowning in a river of my tears
When all my will is gone you hold me sway
I need you at the dimming of the day
You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide
You know just where I keep my better side
What days have come to keep us far apart
A broken promise or a broken heart
Now all the bonnie birds have wheeled away
I need you at the dimming of the day
Come the night you're only what I want
Come the night you could be my confidant
Come the night you're only what I want
Come the night you could be my confidant
I see you on the street in company
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me
I'm living for the night we steal away
I need you at the dimming of the day
I need you at the dimming of the day <start> Hold on honey there's a new dawn coming
and a big bird to sweep you away
Are you born yet Are you listening
Are you sick of staring at the walls
Are you hungry Are you angry
Are you wondering if there's anyone at all
Hold on honey there's a new dawn coming
and a big bird to sweep you away
Keep on dreaming soon there'll be a reason
to see it through one more day
Are you weary Are you sinking
Are you tired of holding up the walls
Are you done with all your thinking
Have you found that there's no one at all
Hold on honey there's a new dawn coming
and a big bird to sweep you away
Keep on dreaming soon there'll be a reason
to see it through one more day
Ain't got no answers here
What I see is not clear
Time to shake it around
Turn my world upside down
and watch as the stars come unhinged
Hold on honey there's a new dawn coming
and a big bird to sweep you away
Keep on dreaming soon there'll be a reason
to see it through one more day
Hold on honey there's a new dawn coming
and a big bird to sweep us away
Keep on dreaming soon there'll be a reason
to see it through one more day
Are you born yet
Are you born yet <start> Wish I could see you just one time oh how it'd ease my troubled mind
If I could hold you just one time and then I pretend that you're still mine
Lips that used to thrill me so they now thrill someone else I know
Gone is the love that once was mine wish I could see you just one time
Oh oh oh oh how I miss you so oh I need you so
I I I'd give this heart of mine if I could see you just one time
Lips that used to thrill me so <start> I wish I didn't love you so
My love for you should have faded long ago
I wish I didn't need your kiss
Why must your kiss torture me as long as this
I might be smiling by know with some new tender friend
Smiling by know with my heart on the mend
But when I try something in that heart says no
You're still there I wish I didn't love you so
But when I try something in that heart says no
You're still there I wish I didn't love you so <start> On the radio there's a song that's playing I swear I wrote
And every single wording rings true.
On and on I go just four worn tires on an open road
And a new song every mile or two
Yeah it's just what I do.
Chorus
I'm a rider across the great unknown
That horizon don't need to get no closer
Let the wheels keep rolling 'cause wherever I go
Cross the blue cross the sky
I know I.. I'm finally home.
Back when I was young
I thought my life was a race to be won
So I ran and I ran like a man with his eye on the prize.
I was all about the next best thing till I figured it out
Now I know I don't have to arrive to be satisfied
Chorus
I'm a rider across the great unknown
That horizon don't need to get no closer
Let the wheels keep rolling 'cause wherever I go
Cross the blue cross the sky
I know I.. I'm finally home.
If life is a highway I broke down somewhere
Between everything's here that I should have been there
After all these years I can finally see
Smack dab in the middle's maybe not such a bad place to be not for me.
 x Chorus
Finally home.
I'm finally home
I'm home. <start> Last night I was pouring out my heart like a waterfall to you
And with one kiss I was a runaway train flying off the track to you
I love you came flooding outcouldn't make it stop couldn't shut my mouth
I felt like a fool then lied and said I was sorry but
I unapologize
I meant every word
Won't take back the way I feel about you
Can't unsay what you heard
'Cause you heard me right
And I won't try to fight 'em back or hide my feelings for you
I unapologize
You know people say a lot of things that they really don't mean
And last night I told a little white lie hoping you'd forget the scene
Where feeling like a movie under bad porch light couldn't help myself when you held me tight
Said what I meant then I lied and said I was sorry
I unapologize
I meant every word
Won't take back the way I feel about you
Can't unsay what you heard
'Cause you heard me right
And I won't try to fight 'em back or hide my feelings for you
I unapologize
Oh there's no time to be
Holding it all in and trying to pretend
That I don't feel anything
Oh I shouldn't have said I'm sorry
I meant every word
Won't take back the way I feel about you
I can't unsay what you heard
'Cause you heard me right
And I won't try to fight back to hide my feelings for you
I unapologize
'Cause you heard me right
I unapologize <start> Well I was sitting at a roadhouse down on Highway 
You were wiping off some ketchup on a table that was done
I knew you didn't see me I was in a corner booth
Of course you weren't my waitress mine was missing her front tooth
So I flagged you down for coffee but I couldn't say a thing
But I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name.
I'm in love with you baby
I don't even know your name
I've never been too good at all those sexual games
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name
So I ordered straight tequila a little courage in a shot
And I asked you for a date and then I asked to tie the knot
I got a little wasted
Yeah I went a little far
But I finally got to hug you when you helped me to my car
The last thing I remember I heard myself say
I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name
I'm in love with you baby
I don't even know your name
I've never been too good at all those sexual games
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name
The next thing I remember I was hearing wedding bells
Standing by a women in a long white lacy veil
I raised the veil she smiled at me without her left front tooth
And I said where the Hell am I and just who the Hell are you
She said I was your waitress
And our last name's now the same
'Cause I'm married to you baby and I don't even know your name
Yeah I'm married to a waitress
I don't even know her name
I've never been too good at all those sexual games
I never thought my love life would quite turn out this way
Hey I'm married to a waitress and I don't even know her name
Get me out of here <start> Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love my own.
Broken song empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love my own.
Broken song empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose my Rose of San Antone <start> Quand je marche dans la rue
La rue vers le SacrCur
Je me souviens des promesses
Au nom de l'amour
Je je vais t'attendre l
Viendrastu pour moi
Je vais t'attendre l
Seulement toi
Tu peux me tenir
Jusqu' ce que le soleil se cache
Et embrassemoi doucement
Jusqu' ce qu'il revienne
Je vais t'attendre l
Viendrastu pour moi
Je vais t'attendre l
Seulement toi
Tu prends peuttre du retard
Tu as peuttre rat ton train
Tu ne peux peuttre pas me pardonner
Les ombres grandissent
Et les foules s'effacent
Je je vais t'attendre l
Viendrastu pour moi
Je vais t'attendre l
Seulement toi
Seulement toi <start> Though you haven't left me yet I know you're just as good as goneI stand here in the doorway of the room where you lie sleeping
In hopes that I don't wake you up with the sounds of my weeping
It breaks my heart to see you laying there
Alone in the bed we used to share
'Cause you no longer want me and I wonder what went wrong
Though you haven't left me yet I know you're just as good as gone
There's so much more between us than just these lonely walls
The echoes of our dying love lingers in the halls
Living separately together in a house that's not a home
Though you haven't left me yet I know you're just as good as gone
Through the eyes of a broken heart I watch my whole world fall apart
I'm trying to revive a love that's died
Hopelessly I'm holding on to a love I know is gone
Gone but not because I haven't tried
Disappearing from your door way now the hurt is twice as strong <start> I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when baby I know down well
I've got you under my skin
I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats repeats in my ear
Don't you know you fool you never can win
Use your mentality wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats how it yells in my ear
Don't you know you fool ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality get up wake up to reality
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin. <start> Why do you treat me as if I were only a friend
What have I done that makes you so diff'rent and cold
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be contented again
Will you be happy when you are withered and old
I cannot offer you diamonds or mansions so fine
I cannot offer you clothes that your young body crave
But if you'll say that you long to forever be mine
Think off the heartaches the tears and the sorrow you'll save
When you are weary and tired of another men's gold
When you are lonely remember this letter my own
Don't try to answer though I've suffered anguish untold
If you don't love me I wish you would leave me alone
While I am writing this letter I think of the past
And of the promises that you are breaking so free
But to this world I will soon say my farewells at last
I will be gone when you read this last letter from me <start> Well look at how you're being
Now that you've gone off the deep end
Look at how you're being
To me and nearly all my friends
You told all the secrets
You promised everybody you would keep
I could be that shallow too
If only I wasn't in so deep
Along the dust of silence
Imaginary beggars call you knight
And your telephone doesn't ring
But you keep it off the hook just the same
And you lie awake at night
Pretending that you just can't get to sleep
I could be that shallow too
If only I wasn't in so deep
I seen your only house
Behind that brand new subdivision
I stood behind you in line
While you agonized over your decision
And your choice has turned out to be the same
As all the others shitty
I could be that shallow too
If only I wasn't in so deep
I could be that shallow too
If only I wasn't in so deep
I could be that shallow too
If I really wanted to
I could do what you do
I could be that shallow too
I could be that shallow too
If I really wanted to
I could do what you do
I could be that shallow too
I could be that shallow too
If I really wanted to
I could do what you do
I could be that shallow too
I could be that shallow too
If I really wanted to
I could do what you do
I could be that shallow too
I could be that shallow too <start> The talk you talk ain't the walk you walk
Why oh why live a lie
The word's you speak you don't really mean
Why oh why live a lie
you can't be true to me be true to you
You can't love me just because you say you do
You're tongue tells stills but you're heart know's well
Why oh why live a lie
you seam blinded by all those temting signs
Why oh why live a lie <start> Some are green
We all know the cost
Comes from wanting things
That cant be yours
Envy is a killer
Ya'll have to fight
When ever he's present
He shows in the light of your eyes
Some are clear
Like a mountain stream
They don't harbor hate
If you know what I mean
Their mind is untroubled
Gilt has no hold
No one can hide
From the story that's told in your eyes
Your eyes are the mirror of your soul
Your eyes give you away
Whatever things are written in your heart
Your eyes can't help but say
Some are hard
All compassion gone
They don't care
Who they walk upon
Afraid to be gentle
Afraid to be kind
They think that loves a weakness
They don't want to find in your eyes
Your eyes are the mirror of your soul
Your eyes give you away
Whatever things are written in your heart
Your eyes can't help but say
Some are blue blue blue
Some are warm
Like a summers day
Full of love
That they give away
Good done in secrets
God will reward
His mighty blessing
He will record in your eyes
Your eyes are the mirror of your soul
Your eyes give you away
Whatever things are written in your heart
Your eyes can't help but say
Your eyes are the mirror of your soul
Your eyes give you away
Whatever things are written in your heart
Your eyes can't help but say
Your eyes are the mirror of your soul
Your eyes give you away
Whatever things are written in your heart <start> You give your hand to me
And then you say hello
And I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
But you don't know me
No you don't know the one
Who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips
Longs to hold you tight
Oh I am just a friend
That's all I've ever been
'Cause you don't know me
I never knew the art of making love
No my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy I let my chance go by
The chance that you might love me too
You give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
Oh you will never know
The one who loves you so
Well you don't know me <start> My friends and me work overtime
All try to walk the bottom line
You've been breathin' down our necks
But soon as we cash our paychecks
We'll be chillin' on my deck Boss Man
Chorus
There's nothin' you can do nothin' you can say
Nothin' you can throw our way come Friday
We've been rubber stampin' paper clippin'
Sortin' fillin' faxin'
It's time to let the good times roll
Nothin' you can say nothin' you can do
Nothin' that can wreck our mood come Friday
We've been roofin' rakin' truckin' pavin
Packin' stackin' layin' block
Farmin' fencin' monkey wrenchin' pickin' up and droppin' off
We can't wait to punch the clock
Come Friday  yeah
Gonna fill my igloo full of ice
Stock up on my way home tonight
Light tiki torches and the grill
Put speakers on the windowsill
Play our music loud and dance all night
Repeat Chorus
We'll be horseshoein' barbecuin' flippin'
Sippin' kickin' back
Lawn chairin' music blarin' laughin' havin' us a blast
Work all week until at last
It's Friday
It's Friday  yeah
Whoa <start> When will my arms grow cold when will your kiss grow old
When will I want to be free exactly one minute past eternity
When will I make you blue she done run around on you
Throw away the love you've given me exactly one minute past eternity
Eternity's for ever so darling have no fear
My love for you will last and last a million million years
When will I say goodbye break your heart and make you cry
Tell you to forget about me exactly one minute past eternity
Eternity's for ever
Exactly one minute past eternity <start> THE THRESHOLD

RECORDED BY CONNIE SMITH
Many shoes have taken steps across the threshold
But no shoes were ever crowder than his
On the day he carried me across the threshold
And gave his brand new bride a wedding kiss
Now a hundred heartaches later at the threshold
All his love for me has vanished there's no doubt
And the lips that kissed me coming through the threshold
Stand there laughing now as I go walking out
I built my little world behind that threshold
I may not have made him happy but I tried
Still his eyes keep looking out across the threshold
For the happiness he thinks he left outside
Now I'm standing all alone at the threshold...
I hear him laughing now as I go walking out <start> Some people say theres no American dream
I hear them talking but they dont say a thing
I still believe youve got to give it to get
Baptize your every aspiration in sweat
I vow my head each night and roll up my sleeves
Cause buddy its a long hard road to Easy Street
Where all the cars go
Fast fast fast
When you step on the gas gas gas
Nobody else is gonna pass me up going down the road
I want a great big house on the hill
Every pocket full of hundred dollar bills
Givin me a thrill thrill thrill I aint never known
Is that asking too much
Am I over the line am I way out of touch
Tell me am I losing my mind
I know I wont never get enough
Is that asking too much
Ive never been accused of dreaming too small
I never saw no shame in wanting it all
I guess thats just the curse of being born poor
No matter what you got you always want more
Everybody wants a lot a little inside
Im not the only one with hungry eyes
That wants a car that goes
Fast fast fast
When you step on the gas gas gas
Nobody else is gonna pass me up going down the road
I want a great bid house on the hill
Every pocket full of hundred dollar bills
Man givin' me a thrill thrill thrill I aint never known
Is that asking too much
Am I over the line am I way out of touch
Tell me am I losing my mind
I know I wont never get enough
Is that asking too much
I just wanna go fast fast fast
When I step on the gas gas gas
Nobody else is gonna pass me up going down the road
I want a great big house on the hill
Every pocket full of hundred dollar bills
Man givin' me a thrill thrill thrill I aint never known
When I step on the gas gas gas
You know I wanna go fast fast fast
Nobody better ever pass me up going down the road
I gotta build me a house on the hill
Every pocket full of hundred dollar bills
Man givin' me a thrill thrill thrill I aint never known
Now is that asking too much <start> I took my baby out and bought her a ring
Man we planned a wedding come spring
Staring right into the eyes of my dreams
Hand in hand down on one knee
Chorus
Down by the Riverside
Down by the Riverside
Told me she would be my bride
Down by the Riverside
She said yes as I held her tight
We made love in the broad daylight
Now I know why the old folks say
Get too close and you'll get swept away
Chorus
Spring came and turned by baby's head around
Rains fell and now I feel like I might drown
Under the weight of this fools crown
There's a tree down by the Riverside
Once it held it's head up high
We carved our vows deep in its side
Now faithless love makes that willow cry
Chorus
Her love turned out to be a lie <start> Away beyond the hill in Idaho
Where yawning canyons greet the sun
As it smiles above the trees in Idaho
To say another night is done
Warm summer winds toss a waving grain
Calling me back to my home again
To dream sweet memories of long ago
Beyond the hill in Idaho

Where yawning canyons greet the sun

To say another night is done
Warm summer winds
 <start> She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said 'I'll love her till I die.'
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby
The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind
Until the night
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby <start> Sudden death that's what you are
Loving you is like riding in a speeding car
They're fun to drive until you drive 'em to far
Sudden death that's what you are
The way you love me my heart starts to pumping
Just like a rabbit hon you really got me jumping
You must be out for blood the way that you've been humping
I'm just like putty in your hands
Your kiss of love still lingers here on my lips
You've got electric honey in your fingertips
I like the way your hair hangs down to your hips
I'm just like putty in your hands <start> I love you so much that I can't leave you even though my mind tells me I should
But then you make me think that you still love me
And all my thoughts of leaving do no good
You've got me heart over mind worried all the time
Knowing you will always be the same
You'll keep hurting me I know but I still can't let you go
Cause my heart won't let my love for you change
Friends tell me they see you with another and in my heart I try hard to forget
But you come home and tell me you still love me
I still hope there's some chance for us yet
You've got me heart over mind
No my heart won't let my love for you change <start>

'Cause I'm all wrapped up in you
Yes I'm all wrapped up in you <start> At the airport in Chicago Sunday night
A soldier and his pretty wife came by
She had brought him there to send him off to war
I heard him say now don't cry anymore
Unashamed they kissed each other there
He ran his fingers through her pretty hair
Once or twice she tried but could not speak
I saw the teardrops rolling down her cheeks
She said now don't you worry I'll be true
I'll hope and pray no harm will come to you
I thought to myself good Lord what a shame
It made me stop and wonder who's to blame
That airport looked so big and then so small
I couldn't hold a teardrop back at all
He turned and ran to catch his waiting plane
She stood there crying calling out his name
She watched his plane go up into the sky
She waited until it was out of sight
Then she smiled and I thought Lord
She's lost her mind
But she reached into her purse and got a dime
She was smiling as she dropped the money in
She was smiling as she let the number ring
And as I left I heard her say into the phone
I'll be over later lover boy he's gone <start> Are you sincere when you say I love you
Are you sincere when you say I'll be true
Do you mean every word that my ears have heard
I'd like to know which way to go will our love grow
Are you sincere 
Are you sincere when you say you miss me 
Are you sincere every time you kiss me 
And are really mine every day all the time
I'd like to know which way to go will our love grow
Are you sincere 
Are really mine every day all the time
I'd like to know 
Which way to go 
Will our love grow  
Are you sincere <start> One mile over and two miles back my heart's been crushed like a paper sack
She loves another it's a natural fact one mile over and two miles back
She called me up and told me she was lonely and she needed my company
But she lived pretty far and my brother had a car
And I had to walk all the way and I got to her house
I could see through the windows and I knew she hadn't played fair
For after we had talked and after I had walked someone was already there
And it was one mile over...
My heart fell into little bitty pieces and I picked 'em up off the groung
I put 'em in a sack and I threw it cross my back
And it must've weighed eight thousand pounds
Road back to my house was dark and lonely and I thought it was never gonna end
I called her name and I cried in vain and I counted every step I went
And it was one mile over... <start> All you want to do is sit around and pout and now I've got enough so I'm gettin' out
I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow
I've been in the doghouse for so doggone long
That when I get a kiss I think that somethin's wrong
I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow
 guitar 
I'll go find a gal that wants to treat me right
You go and get yourself a man that wants to fight
I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow
You start your jaws a waggin' and they never stop
You never shut your moth until I blow my top
I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow
 steel 
I remember back when you were nice and sweet
Things have changed you'd rather fight than eat
I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow
I'm gonna do some ridin' on the midnight train
I'm taking evrything except my balled chain
I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow <start> Verse 
Just across the mountains in a valley down below
Lived a girl I mer back years ago
Her eyes shined like diamonds her hair was of gold
But that was before she left me all alone
Chorus
How she lives in my memory today
Oh how I miss her warm and touching ways
And someday I hope she'll want to go
Back to the mountains and the valley down below
Verse 
One day she came to me and said I have to go
My family is moving I thought you'd want to know
But I'll never forget you and your smiling face
And the way that you held me with your warming grace <start> Waterloo Waterloo where will you meet your Waterloo
Every puppy has his day everybody has to pay everybody has to meet his Waterloo
Now ol' Adam was the first in history with an apple he was tempted and deceived
Just for spite the devil made him take a bite
And that's where ol' Adam met his Waterloo
Waterloo Waterloo...
Little General Napoleon of France tried to conquer the world but lost his pants
Met defeat known as Bonaparte's reterat
And that's where Napoleon met his Waterloo
Waterloo Waterloo...
Waterloo Waterloo... <start> First kiss I thought I died and gone to heaven
There in parking lot of that old 
I filled up a truck
I went in to pay when I walked out
She was with him smilin' as she drove away
I know that's gonna leave a mark
Just like a tattoo on my heart
My little brunette wrecking ball with a sexy southern drawl
Is gonna tear my world apart
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame
I'll come runnin' when she whispers my name
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark.
If you play with fire you're bound to get burned
You would think by now that I would've learned
But she's lookin so hot so what can I say
My mama said don't but I did it anyway
I know that's gonna leave a mark
Just like a tattoo on my heart
My little brunette wrecking ball with a sexy southern drawl
Is gonna tear my world apart
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame
I'll come runnin' when she whispers my name
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark.
I wish you didn't look so dang good
I wish you wouldn't smile at me that way
There's an exit light shinnin' brighter than the sun
Like a sign from above tellin' me to run away
I know that's gonna leave a mark
Just like a tattoo on my heart
My little brunette wrecking ball with a sexy southern drawl
Is gonna tear my world apart
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame
I'll come runnin' when she whispers my name
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark.
And like a tattoo on my heart I know she's gonna leave a mark. <start> Sometimes in fond mem'ry my thoughts go back to the old country church
That I attened as a boy
You know it's kinda funny how we cling to old bygone days and bygone places isn't it
Why it seems like only yesterday that my mother took my childish hand in hers
And led me slowly down that long winding path to hear the word of God
And I seem to sense his presence more strongly there than anyplace I've ever known
There with the singin' of the birds and the humming of the bees
I knew that God was surely there
I knew it just as sure as if he'd laid his hand on my shoulder
And said welcome to my house son
Ah but years have passed and times has brought many heartaches and many tears
I've seen my mother pass onto the great beyond and many loved ones have followed
And I'd seen them go with dispairing hearts and tear dimmed eyes
And now in later days as I stroll along
The grassy footpaths to the old country churchyard
And I view the final resting place of my departed kin
I'm consoled by the thought that their sleep is a happy one
There in the place where God and men are one
And once again I seem to hear the voice of our gentle shepher saing
Welcome welcome to my house my son
Precious years with memory... <start> I almost felt you touching me just now
I wish I knew which way to turn and go
I feel so good and then then I feel so bad
I wonder what I ought to do
If I could only fly if I could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand and I got no where to run
Another sinking sun and one more lonely night
The wind keeps blowing somewhere everyday
Tell me things get better somewhere up the way
Just dismal thinking on a dismal day
And sad songs for us to bare
If I could only fly
If we could only fly
If we could only fly
There'd be no more lonely nights
You know sometimes I write happy songs
Then some little thing goes wrong
I wish they all could make you smile
Coming home soon and I wanna stay
Maybe we can somehow get away
I wish you could come with me when I go again
If I could only fly if I could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand and I got no where to run
Another sinking sun and one more lonely night <start> I remember the times when the devil himself packed a bad seed in life for fear
Bonnie and Clyde were the talk of the land everybody talked about the Barrow gang
Oh the Barrow gang will get you little man I remember my mama would say
Do you listen and wash your hands or the Barrow gang will get you little man
 dobro 
When I went to school there was one sure way to silence the noise of the kids
The teacher would say work your fingers to the bone
Or the Barrow gang will get you if you don't
Oh the Barrow gang will get you...
 banjo 
On Sunday morning in the little white church I was talked of Bonnie and Clyde
We learned about joy and we learned about the veil
And the Barrow gang will get you if you fail
Oh the Barrow gang will get you...
Or the Barrow gang will get you little man or the Barrow gang will get you little man <start> A million roses sent to you one by one
Could never capture the way my feelings run
Could not express or symbolise
The love I find within your eyes

CHORUS
So don't you ever doubt
The meaning of my silence
The words may not come out
But you are the song of my heart

My love's an ocean that words could never chart
A living ocean that's flowing from my heart
One you are sailing alone
The only love I've ever known

REPEAT CHORUS
No hearts and flowers my love in stone is formed
And in the fire of your gentleness I've warmed
Orphans' dreams lost and cold
And you turned them all to gold

REPEAT CHORUS <start> Chorus
Memories of you sweetheart still haunt me so
Everytime I hear your name I almost cry
But there's just one thing that I want you to know
I'll love you till the day I die
Oh we let other people tear us apart
And for no good cause you see
But I hope and pray you'll be mine someday
You'll live and love each other you and me
So if you go don't say goodbye
For you know just what you will cause
Don't leave me here to face this lonesome world
For without you I'm the one that is lost
Chorus <start> I'm goin' away to leave you love
I'm goin' away for a while
But I'll return to you sometime
If I go ten thousand miles
The storms are on the ocean
The heavens may cease to be
This world may lose it's motion love
If I prove false to thee
Oh who'll shoe your pretty little feet
And who'll glove your hand
And who'll kiss your rosy cheeks
When I'm in a far off land
The storms are on the ocean
The heavens may cease to be
This world may lose it's motion love
If I prove false to thee
Oh have you seen those mournful doves
Flying from pine to pine
They're mourning for their own true love
Just like I mourn for mine
The storms are on the ocean
The heavens may cease to be
This world may lose it's motion love
If I prove false to thee <start> She's the sky that holds the clouds
She's the lady of the house
A blind believer in all I dare to be
There's no safer place I've found
Than the shoulder of her white night gown
Oh I've got the best and the worst of her in me
And I'd share her if I could
So the wars would all be over
'Cause she'd raise us all as friends
And no one would ever wonder if somebody wanted them
We'd walk on grass that's greener
And our cares would all be freer
If the world had a mother like mine
She's our father's one great love
She's the one he wanted most
She's the light in the window of the house I grew up in
She takes the midnight call
She's the bravest of us all
Still she sings in the garden she let's her hair down in
Oh the wars would all be over
'Cause she'd raise us all as friends
And no one would ever wonder if somebody wanted them
Tonight would be easier
And our dreams would all be deeper
If the world had a mother like mine
Don't go away don't go away from me
Oh I understand she is a helping hand still
I have to say
She's the sky that holds the clouds
She's the lady of our house
We all need her but no one more than me
Oh the wars would all be over
'Cause she'd raise us all as friends
And no one would ever wonder if somebody wanted them
We'd walk on grass that's greener
And the dishes would all be cleaner
If the world had a mother like mine
Oh like mine <start> I often sing for those I love
Who go to live with Christ above
No more on earth their forms I'll see
When I am gone who'll sing for me
Who'll sing for me when I am gone
And it won't be long 'til  I'll see
When I am gone who'll sing for me
'Til I too must say goodbye
Just over there with Christ I'll be
Get all my friends to sing for me
Who'll sing for me when I am gone
As I so oft for friends have done
And it won't be long 'til  I'll see
When I am gone who'll sing for me <start> Baby won't you come out tonight
Just come up the hill 'cause there's a full moon on the risin'
Hey baby can't you steal away
You know I really need to see you tonight
I just got word you was packin' it in
What's the matter this old town got you crazy again
I can see the sad look in your eyes
But I don't know how to say goodbye
And tomorrow you're gonna have your day
Take your wife and you're gonna run away
Baby while I'm wailin'
You'll be sailin' like a hog across the bay singin'
Ooo la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Baby won't you come out tonight
Oh baby won't you come out tonight
We'll run up the hill and we'll dance in the moonlight
Let me gaze into your eyes 'til we both go blind
Oh baby can I see you tonight
I'm just tryin' to find a way to make it last
Good friends they seem to slip away so fast
An' I know we're both headed down separate tracks
An' when ya' go baby don't look back
There won't be no more sleepin' over on a Tuesday night
No more runnin' to the races for a dark horse at midnight
No more dancin' after hours singin' in the showers
Or clingin' to each other in the soft mornin' light singin'
Ooo la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Oh baby won't ya' come out tonight
Oh baby won't ya' come out tonight
I'll meet ya' on the corner
And you'll be there at midnight
Oh baby can you steal away
You know I really want to see ya' tonight
Ooo baby can you come out tonight
We'll run up the hill and dance again in the moonlight
Oh baby can you steal away
I really wanna see you tonight
Oh baby won't ya' come out tonight
Come up the hill there's a full moon on the rise
Oh baby can ya' steal away
Baby won't ya' come out tonight <start> There must be something fishy goin' on
You said you were goin' on a fishing trip with some old friend
You said that you'd be home tonight somewhere around ten
Well here it is it's two o'clock and you're still not at home
I think there's something fishy goin' on
I think that I'm a sucker that's swallowing your line
I try to make myself believe that it's all in my mind
But you never ask me if I'd like to go along so there must be something fishy goin' on
There's something fishy goin' on on these fishing trips you're goin' on
I'm gettin' tired of staying home alone
Some night when you come home and discover that I'm gone
You can bet there's something fishy goin' on
I guess some largemouth bass left that lipstick on your shirt
I don't think you're a fisherman honey I think you're a flirt
Well if you're goin' fishing then why don't you bring them home
I think there's something fishy goin' on
here's something fishy goin' on...
Yes you can bet there's something fishy goin' on <start> I'm saving my money to buy you a rainbow a rainbow to fit on your finger
After I've gone and bought you the rainbow I'll go out and I'll buy you the moon
When we go walking side by side in the moonlight
We count the stars as we go strolling by
Maybe one day will on those beautiful diamonds
That glisten like the teardrops from your eyes
I'm saving my money <start> FINAL EXAMINATION
WITH DOTTIE WEST

You reset with the love that has built to stand on its own
Somewhere we surely went wrong
So let's study our hearts we may learn we might change our minds
A final examination to test our situation may find love is not really gone
We've been countin' our sorrows and forgettin' all the good times we had
And somewhere love left us alone
So let's count on each other and together we might make the grade
A final examination to test our situation may find love is not really gone
We've been countin' our sorrows... <start> 'Tis sweet to be remembered on a bright or a gloomy day
'Tis sweet to be remembered by a dear one far away
'Tis sweet to be remembered remembered remembered
'Tis sweet to be remembered when you are far away
As I travel on this world just to soothe my rovin' mind
And the messages I get from a dear one left behind
They were filled with sweetest words that's so touch me when I heard
Never never can I forget these are some things that she said
'Tis sweet to be remembered on a bright or a gloomy day
'Tis sweet to be remembered by a dear one far away
'Tis sweet to be remembered remembered remembered
'Tis sweet to be remembered when you are far away <start> Little girl you stand out in the crowd
You're laughing and talking much too loud
But I see a little tear peaking through
It takes one to know one and I know you
It takes one to know one and I know you
The little tear through your smiles I see through
You've been hurt and your frightened you're so blue
It takes one to know one and I know you
Little girl please take hold of my hand
Just go right on and cry I'll understand
Pay no mind if start crying too
It takes one to know one and I know you <start> Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand.
She had ruby red lips coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table
And as she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine.
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered I need you
Take me away from here and be my man.
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.
Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a guy with a drink in his hand.
He had bay blue eyes coal black hair
And a smile that a girl understands.
Then he came and sat down at my table
And as he placed his hands over mine
I found my self wanting to kiss him
For temptation was flowing like wine.
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and he whispered I need you
Let me take you away and be your man.
Then I looked into his eyes and I saw it
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home. <start> When dark of night makes way for the early sun to rise
It's piece of mind that only love can bring
And with the golden sunlight drifting through the morning skies
Your tender touch makes me know that love is a gentle thing
Love is a gentle thing and love can keep you safe and warm
A newborn baby nestled in its mother's arms
Love is a gentle thing and like winter's very first snow falling
And love can be a shelter in a storm
The times when I'm uncertain and get restless in my mind
I'm left alone without a song to sing
But when you come to me at night and pull me to your side
Without a word you tell me that love is a gentle thing
Love is a gentle thing
Love is a gentle thing <start> Your cheatin' heart will make you weep you'll cry and cry and try to sleep
But sleep won't come the whole night through your cheatin' heart will tell on you
When tears come down like falling rain you'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do your cheatin' heart will tell on you
Your cheatin' heart will pine someday and crave the love you threw away
The time will come when you'll be blue your cheatin' heart will tell on you
When tears come down <start> You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinking of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today
You say you'll be mine girl
Till the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today
Me I'm just a lucky guy
Love to hear you say that
Love is love and though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough
To make you mine girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today
Me I'm just a lucky guy
Love to hear you say that
Love is love and though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough
To make you mine girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time girl
We'll go on and on <start> Well the House of Cash just burned down
All the way to the cold hard ground
The doctors came from all over town
To see the memories scattered all around
Then the stars came out by the light of day
And they heard their old friend passed away
That yard looked like a funeral hall
Without the pies and casseroles
Chorus
Well its goodbye Johnny goodbye June
Goodbye fancy living room
Well no one sleeps in Cash's bed
Except the man in black and the woman he wed
And the ring of fire comes full circle
And the ring of fire comes all the way around
And if those ashes in the pool could talk
To the anchor man out on the walk
I'd bet they'd be happy to announce
There'll be no yard sale now
Chorus
And the ring of fire comes full circle
And the ring of fire comes all the way around <start> The look in your eyes when you left here that night
Was like somebody had stolen your soul
The trance you were in made me crawl in my skin
You were under some outer control
But I won't give up hopin' the spell can be broken
When you come around to your own good sense
When you break the chains and you're free again
I'll be waiting here to take you in
When you come around
If it takes a day or a hundred years
Me and my heart are gonna be right here
To pick love up where we put it down
When you come around
The moon can't see out from behind the winter clouds
Don't know how you could find your way home
So I'll stay up all night like I do every night
To make sure that the porch light stays on
The winds may be blowin' but these arms will be open
When you come around to your own good sense
When you break the chains and you're free again
I'll be waiting here to take you in
When you come around
If it takes a day or a hundred years
Me and my heart are gonna be right here
To pick love up where we put it down
When you come around
If it takes a day or a hundred years
Me and my heart are gonna be right here
To pick love up where we put it down
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around <start> With every golden curl in place she's as fine as Queen Anne's lace
And know one could ever fault the way she looks tonight
The man standing by her side shows her off with such eager pride
Seems since I saw her last she's done all right
She could never place me in her mind for me the years have not been kind
She'd never see the boy she knew in the man I've grown to be
From her station and her place she'd never recognize my face
I have fallen like a wind blown leaf from her memory
CHORUS
For she's traded all her pain for bright lights and chilled champagne
And I'm sure her new found friends all think they know just where she's been
Yes they think they know her well all the stories I could tell
She's as fine as Queen Anne's lace but I knew her when
Now it's hard to believe I know but she once loved me long ago
And I suppose I should be hurtin' just to see her once again
Oh but now that she's grown so proud I wouldn't want her anyhow
She's as fine as Queen Anne's lace but I knew her when <start> Tell me I'm great and I'll be greater build me up and I'll fly
Love me now and be glad later and tell your troubles goodbye
Lay some happiness on me so the brighter side you'll see
No more loneliness to be lay some happiness on me

Turn me on the sweet line talkin' show me your love is true
And on a cloud you'll see me walkin' to give it right back to you
Lay some happiness on me so the brighter side you'll see
No more loneliness to be lay some happiness on me

Spill that cup of trouble and sorrow sooner the better for you
Fill it up with happy tomorrow we got some livin' to do
Lay some happiness on me so the brighter side you'll see
No more loneliness to be lay some happiness on me
Cuddle me up and I'll feel hotter honey lips kiss me do
A good good lover makes a bad bad fighter and I'm not pickin' on you
Lay some happiness on me so the brighter side you'll see
No more loneliness to be lay some happiness on me
Lay some happiness on me so the brighter side you'll see
No more loneliness to be lay some happiness on me
Lay some happiness on me <start> Who do you think you're talkin' to
You know me and I know you
Your silence and your stony face
You don't have the ground to waste
Your love is gone 'cause it all comes down to you
What can we say when all is said
A house divided cannot stand
Your head and heart and chary gaze
Life is just too short to waste
Your love is gone 'cause it all comes down to you
I've paid for you and you don't seem to mind
I'm bending over backwards you're not satisfied
What more can I offer to leave 'pon the alter
Your love is gone 'cause it all comes down to you
What can we do when all is done
Your life's not the only one
Just take a look beyond yourself
The reason of your private hell
Your love is gone 'cause it all comes down to you <start> John Hardy was a desperate little man
He carried two guns ev'ry day.
He shot down a man on that West Virginia line
You oughta seen John Hardy gettin' away....
You oughta seen John Hardy gettin' away....
John Hardy stood in that old baroom
So drunk that he could not see.
And a man walked up and took him by the arm
He said Johnny come and go along with me
Poor boy Johnny come and walk along with me.
John Hardy stood in his old jail cell
The tears running down from his eyes.
He said I've been the death of many a poor boy.
But my sixshooters never told a lie
No my sixshooters never told a lie.
The first one to visit John Hardy in his cell
Was a little girl dressed in blue.
She came down to that old jail cell
She said Johnny I've been true to you.
God knows Johnny I've been true to you.
The next one to visit John Hardy in his cell
Was a little girl dressed in red.
She came down to that old jail cell
She said Johnny I had rather see you dead
Well Johnny I had rather see you dead.
I've been to the East and I've been to the West
I've traveled this wide world around
I've been to that river and I've been baptized
So take me to my burying ground
So take me to my burying ground.
John Hardy was a desperate little man
He carried two guns ev'ry day.
He shot down a man on the West Virginia line
You oughta seen John Hardy gettin' away
You oughta seen John Hardy gettin' away. <start> Sun comes up it's Tuesday morning
Hits me straight in the eye
Guess you forgot to close the blind last night
Oh that's right I forgot it was me
I sure do miss the smell of black coffee in the morning
The sound of water splashing all over the bathroom
The kiss that you would give me even though I was sleeping
But I kind of like the feel of this extra few feet in my bed
Telephone's ringing but I don't answer it
Cause' everybody knows that good news always sleeps till noon
Guess it's tea and toast for breakfast again
Maybe I'll add a little T.V. too
No milk God how I hate that
Guess I'll go to the corner get breakfast from Jenny
She's got a black eye this morning Jen how'd ya get it
She says Last night Bobby got a little bit out of hand
Lunchtime. I start to dial your number
Then I remember so I reach for something to smoke
And anyways I'd rather listen to Coltrane
Than go through all that shit again
There's something about an afternoon spent doing nothing
Just listening to records and watching the sun falling
Thinking of things that don't have to add up to something
And this spell won't be broken
By the sound of keys scraping in the lock
Maybe tonight it's a movie
With plenty of room for elbows and knees
A bag of popcorn all to myself
Black and white with a strong female lead
And if I don't like it no debate I'll leave
Here comes that feeling that I'd forgotten
How strange these streets feel
When you're alone on them
Each pair of eyes just filled with suggestion
So I lower my head make a beeline for home
Seething inside
Funny I'd never noticed
The sound the streetcars make as they pass my window
Which reminds me that I forgot to close the blind again
Yeah sure I'll admit there are times when I miss you
Especially like now when I need someone to hold me
But there are some things that can never be forgiven
And I just gotta tell you
That I kinda like this extra few feet in my bed <start> Standing on the road walking down the highway
Ain't going nowhere but that's my way of life
Well I ain't never had much ambition but I always made my own way
By turnin' a couple of jobs in some ladies' backyard I averaged about a dollar a day
I wake up early each morning and before I started on my way
I get some cigarettes and a couple of cups of coffee a sweepin' the local city cafe
Standing on the road...
Ain't never had no one to love me never had girl to call my own
I never would take a chance to fool with romance I guess I'm used to being alone
Nobody wants a drifter so I'll keep moving on
There's nothin' to tie me down when I wanna leave town
Nobody's gonna miss me when I'm gone <start> They say a woman's a fool for weeping a fool to break her own heart
But I can't hold the secret I'm keeping I'm breaking apart
Can't seem to mind my own business whatever I try turns out wrong
I seem like my own false witness and I can't go on
I cover my ears I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies telling me lies
You told me you needed my company and I believed in your flattering ways
You told me you needed me forever nearly gave you the rest of my days
Should've seen you for what you are should never have come back for more
Should've locked up all my silver brought the key right to your door
I cover my ears...
 strings 
You don't know what a chance is until you have to seize one
You don't know what a man is until you have to please one
Don't put your life in the hands of a man with a face for every season
Don't waste your time in the arms of a man who's no stranger to treason
I cover my ears...
I cover my ears...
I cover my ears... <start> Sometimes I'm happy sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am so what can I do
I'm happy when I'm with you


I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you sometimes I hate you <start> Wild flowers along the road
Are pretty to the eye
Make a lovely spray then they start to dry
You and I we sure had our fun
Our moment in the sun
The party rages on til the spirits gone
Here's looking at you
To the years
To the times you were sincere
Like a bottle of wine
That's only good opened in it's time
They say that the strong
Will survive
Well I'm weak but I'm still alive
Saying goodbye
As I changed to a butterfly
Here's looking at you
A child looks at a lion's eye
Lying in a cage
Only sees the good underneath the rage
A challenge is more than an open door
Like wolves feed on the sheep
I don't want to fight for what I cannot keep <start> I hear people talk of heaven
And how it's only for the precious few
But in the book that I've been readin'
Sounds to me like there's a lot of room
So I bet some folks are gonna be surprised
About who makes it to the other side 'cause in the...
Chorus
Heaven I'm headed to
There's a place for preachers thieves and prostitutes
Saints and soldiers beggers kings and renegades
For any soul that ever found amazing grace
Ain't no tellin' who on earth He might include
In the heaven I'm headed to
It's not my place to say
Just who does or doesn't get to go
I'm only one among the many
Stumblin' down that narrow road
There's so many things in this life to love
And I believe there's hope for each of us 'cause...
Chorus
And the only thing I know
We all get the chance to go
Saints and soldiers beggers kings and renegades
Any soul that ever found amazing grace
Ain't no tellin' who on earth He might include
In the heaven I'm headed to
The heaven I'm headed to
The heaven I'm headed to <start> Deep eddy blues... not much to lose
Time on my hands... no news no news
Far from my heart... lost in my mind
Deep eddy blues... sometime sometime
The bar next door to heartbreak hotel
My friends held more than they could sell
Unfaithful heart where will you turn
Deep eddy blues... so much to learn
The soundman smiles... the joke's on me
How many miles before I'm free
Oh just let go... blue diamond shine
The sky's aglow... I see a sign
Deep eddy blues... not much to lose
Time on my hands... no news no news
Far from my heart... lost in my mind
Deep eddy blues... sometime sometime <start> Straight up strong and steady
Hard falls I don't take any
Both feet right beneath me
Firmly on the ground
But each time I see you comin'
The earth moves
Girl you're somethin'
I start right into stumblin'
Catch me now
I'm heart over head over heels over you
Look at what I fell into
You throw me girl like a tumbleweed on a TiltAWhirl
I'm all turned around got my down side up
Either way it looks like what they say about true love's true
'Cause I'm heart over head over heels over you
I need you to hold me real tight
Next thing you know I just might
Break loose and I could fly right into the stratosphere
Oh girl are you with me
Do you feel a little dizzy
This view is a thing of beauty
Way up here
I'm heart over head over heels over you
Look at what I fell into
You throw me girl like a tumbleweed on a TiltAWhirl
I'm all turned around got my down side up
Either way it looks like what they say about true love's true
'Cause I'm heart over head over heels over you <start> Mockingbird singin' a tune
No one knows shes got the blues
A man alone
Singing her song
Like mockingbirds do
Hangin' on mind to the ground
Ain't nothin' gonna bring her down
Its just her and the sky
She doesn't ask why
So I do you
Worry ain't no need to worry
She ain't in a hurry no
Shes right where
Shes needs to be
Worry ain't no need to worry
She ain't in a hurry no
Shes right where
Shes needs to be <start> I used to think love was
The soft rope meant to tie me down
And all that could ever own me
Was a guitar and another town
Ten years can disappear real fast
When every morning just leaves somewhere else behind
But I've been thinking about leaving
Long enough to change my mind
Lyin' here beside you
I can feel it start to pull me away
The thought I'll have again tomorrow
That just came back from yesterday
But your embrace makes any reason
For those memories hard to find
And I've been thinking about leaving
Long enough to change my mind
Sometimes I miss the warm bright lights
Sometimes I miss the crowds
Sometimes I miss the women
I wrapped each song around
Sometimes I miss that world out there
So empty hard and unkind
But I've been thinking about leaving
Long enough to change my mind
Sometimes I miss the warm bright lights
Sometimes I miss the noise
Sometimes I miss the fading sounds
Of every cheering voice
Sometimes I miss that world out there
So empty hard and unkind
But I've been thinking about leaving
Long enough to change my mind
I've been thinking about leaving
Long enough to change my mind <start> This ain't about tailgates
Ain't about bonfires
Ain't about souped up cars water towers
Or drowning in a bottle of Jack
This ain't about Chevy's
Ain't about money
Ain't about blue suede shoes coocoocachoos
Got nothin' to do with that
It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Ah little heartbreak queen
Rockin' the jeans
Baby just read my lips
It's a song about a girl
The one you can't forget
Ah blows your mind every time
You think it's gonna be a hit
It's a song about a girl
Ah it's a song about you oh yeah
This ain't about hometowns
Ain't about back roads
Ain't about shoulda coulda wish I woulda
Rear views looking back
This ain't about goodbyes
Ain't about comebacks
Oh got nothing to do with the stars and the moon
Man you're gettin' way off track
It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Ah little heartbreak queen
Rockin' the jeans
Baby just read my lips
It's a song about a girl
The one you can't forget
Ah blows your mind every time
You think it's gonna be a hit
It's a song about a girl
Baby you ooo ooo ooo yeah you ooo ooo ooo yeah you ooo ooo know who you are
Baby you ooo ooo ooo yeah you ooo ooo ooo read my lips hear my heart
Listen to this guitar
It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Ah little heartbreak queen
Rockin' the jeans
Baby just read my lips
It's a song about a girl
Every time
Ah don't think too hard
Dig too deep
Or read between the lines
It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Ah little heartbreak queen
Rockin' the jeans
Baby just read my lips
It's a song about a girl
The one you can't forget
Ah blows your mind every time
You think it's gonna be a hit
It's a song about a girl girl oh
It's a song about a girl girl oh yeah
It's a song about a girl girl oh
It's a song about a girl
This ain't about tailgates
Ain't about bonfires
Ain't about souped up cars water towers
Drowning in a bottle of Jack <start> I went out to walk
At the end of the night
Away from the people
And out of their sight
Went out to the water
And out in the air
I wanted to see you
Imagined you there
...we go round
Merry go round
Merry go round
Merry go round
I wanted to see you
Imagined you there
With that look in your eyes
And the wind in your hair
Away from the others
And out in the air
I wanted to see you
Imagined you there
...we go round and around
Merry go round and around
Merry go round
And the damn thing never stops
Merry go round
Merry go round
Merry go round
Merry go round
I waited for you
As the moon looked on
And the wind cried its heart out
On finding you gone
Just wandering aimlessly
Knowing not where
And foolishly hoping
You'd follow me there
...we go round and around
Merry go round and around
Merry go round
And the damn thing never stops <start> I'm calling from the station and I haven't got much time to let you know
Got a ticket for Missouri and there's things I need to say before I go
If I could I'd have you meet me but I don't see how I can
I don't have enough to pay your fare
There's a factory in Columbus hiring now I understand
And they're looking for an able bodied man
You should meet some money in the letter that I mailed two days ago
But when I wrote the letter saying you could come to me I didn't know
And I was goin' to lose my job in such a little while
So now we're gonna have to change our plan
They may not hire me in Columbus but I'm pretty sure they will
Cause they're looking for an able bodied man
If I'd've more education now I'd've made a better life for me and you
But just simple manual labor is the only kind of work that I can do
The bus is loadin' for Missouri so I guess I'd better go
I'll call you just as soon as I can <start> There's an old tear stained worn King James
Bible on my lap
I can hear mama now say it won't let you down
And it never has
So I turn to the Psalms straight to the one
That I can quote by heart
But the words that used to comfort me are tearing me apart
Chorus
He leaded me through death's dark valley
And by still waters too
Surely goodness and his mercy
Are gonna pull me through
But tonight I've wrestled wit the devil
Wrestled with the truth
If the lord is my shepherd
And I shall not want
Why do I still want you
All my friends say this will end
You're not the one for me
Cause I'm the kind that loves for life
And your the kind that leaves
So I've been praying and I've been waiting
For some kind of peace
But you haven't phoned and I'm leaning on Old Psalms twentythree
Chorus <start> I had a man who's good and kind in his way
Yeah I had a man sweet and kind in his way
Lord he died and he left me
And I sing the blues on every decoration day
Lord I was standing standing 'round my baby's bed
Well my Lord my lord he take my baby away
Why why why why
When your soul don't come back
Lord I hung my head and cried
Said now baby please please don't worry
Said now baby please please don't worry
'Cause everybody's gotta go
Why why why why
The best man God knows I ever had
All day that Sunday
I just hung my head and cried
So sad that Sunday
When my Lord he take my baby <start> Whenever a chance to meet some old friends on the street
They wonder how does a man get to be this way
I always got a smileing face any time and any place
And everytime they ask me why
I just smile and say
You've got to kiss angel good mornin
And let her know you think about her when your gone
So kiss an angel good mornin
And love her like the devil when you get back home
Now people may guess the secret of happeniness
Some of them never learn
It's a simple thing
The secret I'm speaking of
Is a woman and a man in love
And the anwser is in this song that I always sing
You got to kiss an angel good mornin
And let her know you think about her when your gone
So kiss an angel good mornin
And love her like the devil when you get back home <start> The truth is too painful
This moment too real
Saying goodbye
But loving you still
Too late to start over
We've tried that before
And I just don't have it in me
To try anymore
Chorus
But I know I'll miss you
And I know I'll cry
I know you loved me
And I know you've tried
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever do in my life
But I know no good way
Of saying goodbye
nd chorus
I know I'll miss you
And I know I'll cry
I know you loved me
And I know I'll ask why
I know I'll have moments
When I'll want to die
But I know no good way
Of saying goodbye
Tag
And the longest night
I'll ever spend will be tonight
'cause I know no good way of saying <start> THAT AIN'T A WOMAN'S WAY

RECORDED BY KITTY WELLS
I sat alone at home all weekend waitin' for you to call
But the phone didn't ring and the door didn't knock and I sat there talkin' to the wall
Then today when you did come around it didn't mean nothing to you
You say in your heart you know you love me and I oughta know it too
But that ain't a woman's way baby that ain't a woman's way
A woman has to know she's loved and needed every day
All you wanna do is tease me all you wanna do is play
Breakin' up makin' up stayin' all shakin' up that ain't a woman's way
No that ain't a woman's way
Just today I begged you please let's have a little talk about us
But you said no that you had to go and we ended up having a fuss
If I asked you to give me a ring you probably would on the phone
Sometimes I can't help but think I'd be better off alone
That ain't a woman's way baby... <start> He'd say can't never could do nothin'
And weights what broke the wagon
There ain't no fence between right or wrong
Sometimes you gotta fight if you wanna get along
You better stand up when that flag gets raised
Or down on your knees when it's time to pray
But the greatest thing about him to me
Was the fact that he believed
Chorus
He believed in the good Lord above
A straight shootin' rifle and the power of love
He believed in why the blood was shed
And if he couldn't be free he'd rather be dead
And to never give up on your dreams
But most of all yeah most of all he believed in me
Well he had his own opinion
About the world and its condition
Spare the rod spoil the child
You'll reap what you sow if you let it grow wild
You just gotta deal with the hand you're dealt
Never give up and you'll never really fail
But the greatest thing about dad to me
Was the fact that he believed
Chorus
Bridge
Oh and just because of him I know who I am today
And just because of that I know where he's gone to stay
Chorus <start> Too old too old he's too old to cut the mustard anymore
Well when I was young I had a lotta pep I could get around I didn't need no help
But since I'm old and a gettin' gray the people all look at me and say
Too old too old he's too old to cut the mustard anymore
Buddy's gettin' too old Buck's done got too old
He's too old to cut the mustard anymore
I used to could jump just like a deer now I need a new landing gear
I used to could jump a picket fence but now I'm lucky if I jump an inch
Too old too old...
 piano 
Well when I was young I had an automobile scoot myself right under the wheel
I had to fight the gals off with a stick but now they say he makes me sick
Too old too old...
Buck's too old to cut the mustard anymore <start> hey little mama
don't you take it so hard
they never had the time for you
you wandered in the yard
with magic all around you
and the golden dust of god
you're all grown up
you've got a baby in your arms
you're all grown up
you've got a baby in your arms
between the world of the humans
and your expanding heart
you've been holding your own hand
ever since the start
now you're trying to be for somebody
what nobody was for you
did you think that this would be
the hardest thing you'd ever do
did you think that this would be
the hardest thing you'd ever do
but oh you love her
like you never thought you could
and oh you love her
like the moon it loves the earth
well
well oh well
he reminds you of your daddy
with all his tricks and charms
he reminds you of your daddy
every time he lets you down
you believe him when he tell you
he'll stop drinking for you
yeah you think that if you love him
maybe he will change for you
yeah you think that if you love him
maybe he will change for you
hey little mama
don't you take it so hard
the things you are remembering
will surface and depart
and you won't feel so crazy
hanging on a while
and you will give to her
the life that she deserves
and you will give to her
a life that she deserves
'cause oh you love her
like you never thought you could
and oh you love her
like the moon it loves the earth
well yeah
oh yeah
the whole world <start> I was lonely I guess the night that we met in a tavern down on old Broadway
And there were tears in her eyes and she whispered with a sigh
Stranger please take me out of here
But it was only commercial affection cause a fool and his money will part
Yes it was only commercial affection but she walked away with my heart
Steel Piano Interlude
I stood in disbelief as she hurried off to meet another fool down on old Broadway
Now many nights have come and gone still the echo lingers on
Stranger please take me out of here
But it was only commercial affection... <start> SOMEONE TO GIVE MY LOVE TO

' Jack  Bill Music
Well I could search from now to the end of the time never find another you
I'm so glad because I know you're mine someone to give my love to
Well I believe my love that you're one of the kind for there's no one else like you
You're the light of my life so let it shine someone to give my love to
Well I find happiness is lovin' you and I'll do my best to make your dreams come true
Now I will follow you to the end of the earth for my place will be with you
Well I have taken you for better or worse someone to give my love to
Well I find happiness is lovin' you and I'll do my best to make your dreams come true
Days of manandwifetime are precious few I will spend them all with you
Then beyond forever I'll wait for you someone to give my love to
Mhmm mhmm mhmm mhmm
Well you're the light of my life so let it shine shine on me my whole life through
Well you're the light of my life so let it shine I need someone like you <start> Troubled in mind I'm little blue
Bet you I won't be blue always
'Cause that ol' sun's gonna shine
On Jerry Lee Lewis's back door step someday
I'm gonna lay my head
On somebody's lonesome railroad line
Let that ol' midnight special
Ease my troubled mind
Well they tell me that old graveyard
Is a mighty lonesome place
Lord they put you six feet under
Shovellin' mud directly in your face
Well goodbye baby may God bless you
And may He bless ol' Killer a little bit too
Oh don't meet you over yonder baby
When they throw that Jerry right over you <start> I suppose I'll get over you in time and I hope it's before I lose my mind
All the pleasure in my life is gone and the hurt goes on the hurt goes on
If your mem'ry ever haunts you about me
Then you'll know how this feeling feels inside me
I can't stop it your mem'ry's all I own and the hurt goes on the hurt goes on
If your mem'ry ever haunts you about me
And the hurt goes on the hurt goes on <start> Dallas packed her suitcase
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her
She made leaving me look easy
I wish she'd made it look a little harder
I took her out of Texas
When she was just a girl
But old Tennessee and me
Couldn't take Texas out of her
Oh how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
Then nothin' else would come between the two of us
If Dallas was in Tennessee
By now she's leaving Memphis
And everything we had behind her
Lord I hope the gold band on her hand
Will serve as a reminder
That true love is a treasure
That's very seldom found
But you can't stay together if there's no common ground
Oh how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
Then nothin' else would come between the two of us
If Dallas was in Tennessee
Oh if Dallas was in Tennessee
Dallas packed her suitcase
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her <start> The big moon is risin' so bright in the sky
But it won't shine brighter than the stars in your eyes
It rises above me so bright and so blue
And I won't see anyone as lovely as you
Take me into the night
Past these lonely dreams in my heart
I love you more than I could show you
More than I could know in my heart
So lay down beside me and hold me tonight
For your love has found me and it feels so right
These thoughts in my mind are so scattered and few
And I won't see anyone as lovely as you
Take me into the night
Past these lonely dreams in my heart
I love you more than I could show you
More than I could know <start> She walked in dressed in red
Didn't take long to lose my head
All this time I never knew
There were girls with eyes so blue
Certain of herself she walked around
As if she knew she owned this town
Talking to her I'd have never guessed
End of the night I'd kiss the girl in red
Chorus
I'm not the kind to make up my mind
To lose sanity lose my head
For some girl in red
I smell the smoke still hear the band
Taste the beer that was in my hand
That night we met runs through my head
I can't forget the girl in red
I'm not the kind to make up my mind
To lose sanity lose my head
For some girl in red
Solo
I'm not the kind to make up my mind
To lose sanity lose my head
For some girl in red
I'm not the kind to make up my mind
To lose sanity lose my head
For some girl in red <start> Imagine a dirt road full of pot holes
With a creek bank and some cane poles
Catching channel cat
I'm a little more country than that
Picture a small town with an old hound
Laying out front of the court house
While the old men chew the fat
I'm a little more country than that
I just want to make sure you know just who you're getting under this old hat
Cause girl I'm not the kind of two time or play games behind your back
I'm a little more country than that
Think of a hank song from days gone
With a steel ride that's so strong
It sends chills up your back
I'm a little more country than that
If you want a brick home in a school zone
With the doors locked and alarms on
Girl you're way off track
I'm a little more country than that
I just want to make sure you know just who you're getting under this old hat
Cause girl I'm not the kind of two time or play games behind your back
I'm a little more country than that
Yeah I'm sure that you've heard those three words from others
But they fell flat
But this ring ain't something that I mean to give you
And then take back
I'm a little more country than that
I'm a little more country than that
I'm a little more country than that <start> Katy Hill is a traditional song instrumental. There are no known lyrics. Popularized by Bill Monroe playing with Jerry Garcia . <start> Hes as sweet as cotton candy at the county fair
He's a cool drink of water with butterscotch hair
He swore that he loved me
Well I guess he probably did
'Cause when he rolled up his sleeve one day
I saw my name next to his
A new tattoo stinging like a hornet
Two little hearts like a big red warning
I wasn't looking for a permanent thing
First comes the ink then comes the ring
Burn burn baby
I bet we could've made a bunch of sweet memories
You should have slowed down mister
Moving like a twister's just a little fast for me
So now it's zero to sixty
And if you ever miss me I'm right there on your arm
Don't you cry I'll leave you something behind
Skid marks and a double heart
Well he's a tough bronc buster
I bet he sleeps in his boots
Well he tried to throw a rope around me right out of the shoot
He swore that he loved me
Well I reckon he probably did
'Cause when he rolled up his sleeve one day
I thought here we go again
A new tattoo burning like a brand
Two little hearts on my rodeo man
I wasn't looking for a permanent thing
First comes the ink then comes the ring
Burn burn baby
I bet we could've made a bunch of sweet memories
You should have slowed down mister
Moving like a twister's just a little fast for me
Well now it's zero to sixty
And if you ever miss me I'm right there on your arm
Don't you cry I'll leave you something behind
Skid marks and a double heart
I'm a free bird
A new tattoo whistling Dixie
Two little hearts ain't gonna get me
I'm not looking for a permanent thing
So don't you put ink 'til I take the ring
Burn burn baby
I bet we could've made a bunch of sweet memories
You should have slowed down mister
Moving like a twister's just a little fast for me
Well now it's zero to sixty
And if you ever miss me I'm right there on your arm
Don't you cry I'll leave you something behind
Skid marks and a skid marks and a
Skid marks and a double heart
Well I'm a free bird
Hey hey hey yeah hey <start> You throw away the gun
Did I tell you what's to be done
I need it to kill just one
And you said I cannot sit sadly by your side
And you said I cannot sit sadly by your side
I try to push open the door
Just to see what came before
But there is a body on the floor
And you said I cannot sit sadly by your side
And you said I cannot sit sadly by your side
You brought back that guitar
I told you I wanted it no more
It only plays the songs that no one is asking for
I cannot sit sadly by your side
I cannot sit sadly by your side
I bust in to the room not knowing really what to do
So I reach down and tear out page two hundred and fifty two
It reads  I can not sit sadly by your side
It reads. I can not sit sadly by your side <start> Lay back lay back go to sleep my man
Wipe the blood from you face and your hands
Forgive yourself if you think that you can
Go to sleep go to sleep my man
Twentyone days lost at sea I fought
For twentytwo years nonstop I've talked
Through the desert pissed drunk and confused I walked
I spit a tooth in the palm of my hand
Lay back lay back go to sleep my man
Wipe the blood from you face and your hands
Forgive yourself if you think that you can
Go to sleep go to sleep my man
Well the wind and the trees are ganging up on me
They sing my funeral song in harmony
Well I just want to walk home on the drunk I need
But they keep singing and singing and singing to me
La La La La La La 
La La La La La La 
La La La La La La 
Well I wish things were different true and deep
But everything that's so shallow is everything about me
If only I could just take all my money and leave
I hope the people on the ground will understand
I hope the people out there will understand
Lay back lay back go to sleep my man
Wipe the blood from you face and your hands
Forgive yourself if you think that you can

To help me through the trials of this life
But there's one thing I can't do with out and Copenhagens what I'm talkin'
About and I love it nearly as much as I love my wife
Now when I first started chewin' I didn't know what I was doin'
But I liked the way it helped me to relax
And a big ol' chew tastes might good just the way I know Copenhagen should
But when its gone I'm a slobbering maniac
I'm a Copenhagen junkie there's a big ol' hairy monkey on my back
And it just won't let me be
Cause when I run out of chewin' I know I'm on the road to ruin
That Copenhagen's got a hold on me
I can go without a lot of things like sweet potatoes and butter beans
And you know if wouldn't really bother me at all
I can go without coffee for a couple of days but if you take my s'noose away
I'll be climbing like the spider up the wall
I'm a Copenhagen junkie...
Well I even tried to quit one time my knees got weak I sorta went blind
And my mellow disposition headed south
I started eating like a big fat hog got wild got mean like a rabid dog and
Start frothin' and foamin' at the mouth
I'm a Copenhagen junkie...
Can I help you sir ah yeah do you got any Copenhagen
No Sir I'm afraid we're all out ah

Ah Copenhagen it makes me feel so good

But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all
Rudolph the rednosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose.
And if you ever saw him
You would even say it glows.
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names.
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games.
Then one foggy Christmas eve
Santa came to say
Hey Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the rednosed reindeer
You'll go down in history

Don't call it love

We got a better thing baby

Just tell 'em you're my everything
Go on and tell 'em baby
Nobody believes we got somethin' they ain't got

We're burning as bright as any star

Don't call it love

Time stands still while there's still wine around
She's the one you let in out of the cold
The one who's neer and always alone
Did she let him go
Or did the four winds blow him away
Oh does she even know
She's the girl with the red balloon
Keep her glass full of cheap champagne
She will tell of a man with no name
Smoke and mirrors have done her in
She's in love and she won't be again
Oh did she let him go
Or did the four winds blow him away
Oh does she even know
She's the girl with the red balloon
So lovely
So lonely
Floating away
Oh did she let him go

'Cause I've taken all the past times and I've stored 'em in my memory
She probably thinks I'm crazy
She probably thinks I've lost my mind
'Cause when she drove away well I just waved goodbye
It's been one time two times three times more
Than I can bear to stand
The clock is stopped from that slammin' door
And I can't turn the hands
Well I've lost track of time but you're still right here with me
'Cause honey I might lose my mind but I'll never lose your memory
Everybody asks me how I got over you
Well I just tell them that we are just about overdue
Well it don't matter how far you go cause you're never far from me

Searching for the things in life that matter thinking that the world was out of act
I'm going back to the girl that I still dream of going back to find the place for me
I found out what life was really made of I'm going back to the man I used to be
 steel 
I've lived much too long without direction really don't know what I thought I'd find
But the mountains I've climbed out in the country
I find that they were only in my mind
I'm going back to the girl that I still dream of going back to plant my family tree
I found out what life was really made of I'm going back to the man I used to be <start> TOO SOON TO KNOW

' AcuffRose Music

It's too soon to know if I can forget her
My heart's been broken into many pieces and it's too soon to know
Time passes slow will I ever know
If I can forget her and not let it show but it's too soon to know
News travels fast when a love affair ends
People keep asking what happened to them
But it's too soon to know if I can forget her
My heart's been broken into many pieces and it's too soon to know
My heart's been broken into many pieces and it's too soon to know <start> I'm gonna stay right here beside him cause a woman's place is with her man
So many times a man gets lonesome and that's when he needs a helping hand
A woman's hand though so soft and gentle can do so much to help her man
Just holding him each time he needs you the power of love is in a woman's hand
It's a woman's hand that makes a man go searching
It's a woman's hand that's make a man stay home
For he can't do either one without a woman
It's a woman's hand that leads him right or wrong
No he can't do either one... <start> The time is coming soon to say goodbye
A time of sadness it will be
But honey listen to my parting sigh
And linger on awhile with me
The stars above youyet linger awhile
They whisper I love youoh linger awhile
And when you have gone away
Every hour seems like a day
I've something to tell you
Oh linger awhile
The stars above youyet linger awhile
They whisper I love youoh linger awhile
And when you have gone away
Every hour seems like a day
I've something to tell you
Oh linger awhile <start> Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl.
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl.
Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell.
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love but in vain I could tell.
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind.
Dashing and daring
A drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina
The girl that I loved.
So in anger I
Challenged his right for the love of this maiden.
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore.
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor.
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the FOUL EVIL deed I had done.
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run.
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied.
I caught a good one.
It looked like it could run.
Up on its back
And away I did ride
Just as fast as I
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico.
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless.
Everything's gone in life nothing is left.
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death.
I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark.
Maybe tomorrow
A bullet may find me.
Tonight nothing's worse than this
Pain in my heart.
And at last here I
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's cantina below.
My love is strong and it pushes me onward.
Down off the hill to Felina I go.
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more.
Shouting and shooting I can't let them catch me.
I have to make it to Rosa's back door.
Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side.
Though I am trying
To stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary
Unable to ride.
But my love for
Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary I can't stop to rest.
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle.
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest.
From out of nowhere Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side.
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina goodbye. <start> In the summertime
When all the trees and leaves are green
And the redbird sings I'll be blue
'Cause you don't want my love
Some other time
That's what you say when I want you
Then you laugh at me and make me cry
'Cause you don't want my love
You don't seem to care a thing about me
You'd rather live without me
Than to have my arms around you
When the nights are cold and you're so all alone
In the summertime
When all the trees and leaves are green
And the redbird sings I'll be blue
'Cause you don't want my love
Once upon a time
You used to smile and wave to me
And walk with me but now you don't
'Cause you don't want my love
Some other guy
Is takin' up all your time
Now you don't have time for me
You don't want my love
You don't seem to care a thing about me
You'd rather live without me
Than to have my arms around you
When the nights are cold and you're so all alone
In the summertime
When all the trees and leaves are green
And the redbird sings Incomprehensible
'Cause you don't want my love <start> Life you have been good to me
Life have you chosen me
To give your blessings too
Life you served your finest wine
I drank it down to find
My glass was always full
Life sometimes you made me sad
Although I always had the very best
A friendship love and happiness
Tonight I raise my glass to you
I hope that I've been true
To life
And yes you served your finest wine
I drank it down to find
My glass was always full
Life sometimes you made me sad
Although I always had the very best
A friendship love and happiness
And now it's all been said and done
I dedicate this song
To life <start> Here comes a Baptist here comes a Jew
There goes a Mormon and a Muslim too

Why can't we be one big happy family
You like the day and I like the night

There's folks on the left and the far right
But that doesn't mean that we have to fight
We're all God's children
All God's children
Yeah we're all God's children
Why can't we be one big happy family

Throw the shades and close the curtains
The Lamp on the tables burning
Baby dont turn it off.
Theres no one here Just you and me alone
and i wanna love you with the lights on
Tonight i wanna see it all
your hair come down and your dress Fall slowly
off your shoulders to the floor

See your breathing see your smile
Take you into my arms and take you nice and slow
Till the want in me is gone
I wanna lay here all night long and love you
With The lights on
Baby your one sexy lady
You can look at me like im crazy
But you are
It dont make sense to me
Hiding that beautiful body In the dark
Lets take a step out of our comfort zone
and do a little loving with the lights on
Tonight i wanna see it all
your hair come down and your dress Fall slowly
off your shoulders to the floor
i wanna look into your eyes
See your breathing see your smile
Take you into my arms and take you nice and slow

What makes a man wander what makes a man wander
The whistle of a train does something to your brain
What makes a man wander what makes a man wander
I know you love me as much as you ever could love anyone yet you're still gone
You come back and you vow that you settle down now
Then you're gone with the dawn
Why do you like to roam if you've got so much love at home
What makes a man wander what makes a man wander
I know you love me as much
Why do you like to roam
What makes a man wander what makes a man roam <start> I put down my razor
Toweled off my face
Thought I saw a new wrinkle
And another strand of gray
That one little scar
Kept catching my eye
Reminding me how time does fly
I was only a kid
When I had that first fight
But I still don't give in
When I believe that I'm right
And at least I can stand here
And like what I see
In the man that kid turned out to be
Lookin back at myself
It's plain to see
That the cold hands of time
Ain't had much mercy on me
But I played a straight game
With the cards that were dealt
And I can look straight ahead
Lookin'back at myself
Now I ain't been no angel
But I learned right from wrong
Thanks to mamma and a hickory
And a love so strong
Yes she taught the rule
That life is lived by
I ain't forgot what you get
For getting'out of line
Now this old world throws some punches
And I've taken a few
Now my skin's tough as leather
But I've grown strong with the truth
There's been so many times I could've just stepped aside
Ah but then I couldn't stand here with this peace of mind
Lookin'back at myself
It's plain to see
That the cold hands of time
Ain't had much mercy on me
But I played a straight game
With the cards that were dealt
And I can look straight ahead
Lookin'back at myself <start> O Sanctissima O Piissima

I go to all our favorite places and I always play our favorite song
I can't keep my sadness from showing and old friends keep asking me what's wrong
Just plain lonely without your arms around me just plain lonely I'm missing you
I live each day by pretending that your love for me is still strong
Then suddenly my dream has an ending I wake up and realize you're gone

I'm the same old girl that I used to be
I haven't changed at all
I got the same old walk and the same old talk
That would run you up the wall
The same old face and the same old smile and
The same old baby blues
And I'm still doing the rhumba baby
So I'm still the girl for you
I'm still doing the rhumba baby
I can't seem to quit
If my mama catches us doing the rhumba
Mama would just pitch a fit
But I can't help myself it's much bigger than me
If I were you I'd hang onto a rhumba girl like me
There's lots of girls on the floor tonight
With a lot slicker steps than me
The boogaloo and the funky broadway
Are such a pretty sight to see
My step might be old fashioned
But it's just fine with me
I got a couple of rhumba steps
You might like to see
I'm still doing the rhumba baby
I can't seem to quit
If my mama catches us doing the rhumba
Mama would just pitch a fit
But I can't help myself it's much bigger than me
If I were you I'd hang onto a rhumba girl like me <start> I'm like a cloud drifting from town to town each new love just helps me on my way
No one woman's ever gonna tie me down
When one gets too close I'll just back up and say
I gotta be walkin' on new grass singin' a new song
Tomorrow there's no telling where I'll be
But I'll be walking on new grass singing a new song
The next time up the road keeps calling me
I'm warning you don't fall in love with me I don't plan on being here too long
You're just a leaf caught in a playfull breeze I'll carry you a while then I'll move on
I gotta be walkin' on new grass...
 guitar 
I won't take roots I never stay that long and a bad seed just won't grow anyway
This rolling stone don't wanna gather no moss
When the grass starts to grow I'll back up and say
Well I gotta be walkin' on new grass... <start> They wake up in the morning
And they drink their coffee black
They love their women
One beat shy of a heart attack
On the way to work
They might stop by a fishin' hole
That's how country boys roll
Yeah they work work work
All week 'til the job gets done
Weekends they barbecue
And have a cold one
They run on a big old hog
And a pinch of Skoal
That's how country boys roll
Yeah they're spinnin' their wheels
Castin' their reels
Way back on them old county roads
Singin' in bars
Soupin' up cars
Just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and a glove
To them fallin' in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll
Well if you don't know your way around
They'll draw you a map
And if you're broke and you ask
They'll give you the shirt off their back
All they need is a little gas
A few dollars to fold
That's how country boys roll
Yeah they're spinning their wheels
Castin' their reels
Way back on them old county roads
Singin' in bars
Soupin' up cars
Just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and a glove
To them fallin' in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll
Ah come on
Yeah they're cryin' and loud
Humble and proud
They love mama and Jesus and Jones

When I wake with the blest in those mansions of rest
Will there be any stars in my crown.

In the strength of the Lord let me labor and pray
Let me watch as a winner of souls
That bright stars may be mine in the glorious day
When his praise like the sea billow rolls.
Will there be any stars any stars in my crown
When at evening the sun goeth down
When I wake with the blest in those mansions of rest
Will there be any stars in my crown.

Living gems at his feet to lay down
It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold
Should there be any stars in my crown.

Will there be any stars any stars in my crown
When at evening the sun goeth down
When I wake with the blest in those mansions of rest
Will there be any stars in my crown... <start> Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from  to 
Workin'  to  what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
 to  for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fat promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the bossman's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
You're in the same boat with a lotta your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
An' the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way
Workin'  to  what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
 to  yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you dream about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
 to  whoa what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
 to  yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you dream about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
 to  working  to  <start> It's yer
Sweet interjection
Kind of affection
Boring contraption
Gooey confection
Circumlocution
Rasputin tootin
Dismal depression
Rich little impression
Cosmic connection
Third world oppression
Antique collection
Recording session
Texas seccession
Troubling vibration
Doubling inflation
Mystic incantation
Pagan celebration
Taxation without representation
Makes me roll... <start> I used to wake up nights
Callin' out your name
Then i'd cry myself back to sleep
Knowing i'd only dreamed
I stayed inside for days
Trapped within my mind
Wonderin' where you had gone
Convinced I could not go on
Now just when I started feeling
Those hands of time start to healing
You're here at my door
Saying your new dreams
Have led you back to me
Where were you
When I was going crazy
Where were you
Did you know what your leavin'
Put me through
You were feeling lost last thing I knew
You went off to find yourself
Where were you
I can't pretend i'm strong
Or act like I don't care
But I won't betray my heart
Now that we've come this far
I let you go 'cause I had to
I'll close this door 'cause I need to
This tunnel has a light
It's not that far away
It's brighter every day
Where were you
When I was going crazy
Where were you
Did you know what your leavin'
Put me through
You were feeling lost last thing I knew
You went off to find yourself
Where were you <start> THE LOVING KIND
WRITERS ROGER BOWLING LARRY BUTLER
Somewhere I heard these words one time
Love is like a clinging vine
Wrap me 'round your heart
And 'round your mind
I've never had to cling to you
'Cause I have no fear of losin' you
Our love is not a clinging vine
It's the lovin' kind
Somewhere I let read these words one time
Love is like a glass of wine
Aging made it sweeter and so fine
It's no better now than before
'Cause we've got the best and there's nothin' more
Our love is not a glass of wine
It's the lovin' kind
Let them write their fancy words
For people who have never heard or tasted
A love like yours and mine
Ours is not a clinging vine
And its certainly not a glass of wine
It's love
And our love is the lovin' kind
Our love is not a clinging vine
And its certainly not a glass of wine
It's love
And our love is the lovin' kind <start> As long as I love I will love you
As long as the stars may shine above you
You can be sure my heart will be true for as long as I love
As long as the waves touch the seashore
You'll be the one I will live for
There'll never be one I could love more for as long as I love
In this world of changing times I'm so glad to say that I'm
Unchangeably in love with you
In this world of doubt and fear I feel nothing when you're near
Cause I know that you love me too
As long as the dream stirs the willows
As long as the dew falls on the meadows
My heart is yours and it will be so for as long as I love
As long as I love <start> One mornin' one mornin' as work I begun
What did I see ridin' out of the sun
On the road from Lexington
One rider one rider beatin' the breeze
Down on his saddle low to his knees
Comin' through my willow trees
Now closer the terrible work of the gun
Was stiffened and black where his blood all had run
But I knew my wayward son
One mornin' one mornin' the boy of my breast
Came to my door unable to rest
Even in the arms of death <start> We've been through some things together
With trunks of memories still to come
We found things to do in stormy weather
Long may you run
Long may you run
Long may you run
Although these changes have come
With your chrome heart shining in the sun
Long may you run
Well it was back in Blind River in 
When I last saw you alive
Rollin' down that empty ocean road
Gettin' to the surf on time
Long may you run
Long may you run
Although these changes have come
With your chrome heart shining in the sun
Long may you run
Long may you run
Long may you run <start> There's a picture that I carry
One we made sometime ago
When they ask who's in the picture with me
I say just someone I use to know
Just someone I use to spend some time with
Just a flame that lost its glow
And I don't tell them how lost I am without you
I say just someone I use to know
Just someone I use to run around with
Just a friend from long ago
I don't tell them all the nights I cry without you
I say just someone I use to know
I say just someone I use to know <start> This place will tell you lies
With each passing shadow that goes by
But there's only one or two at most just three
More likely none that I still believe
They'll say you're not alone
But don't listen to them
Tell that very long I did then find out through misery
That the true population's me
I used to look for days around
But no trace of her love could be found
I'd holler cry out beg and scream
Throw myself down then start to plead
Searched for her heart 'til mine would bleed
Offered it up but there wasn't any need
Too late to care she's no longer here
The population's me
I used to look for days around
But no trace of her love could be found
I'd holler cry out beg and scream
Throw myself down then start to plead
Searched for her heart 'til mine would bleed
Offered it up but there wasn't any need
Too late to care she's no longer here
The population's me
This place will tell you lies
With each passing shadow that goes by
But there's only one or two at most just three
More likely none that I still believe <start> 
My god insane
He makes me say
The strangest things
The meanest things
My god is blind
He asked me not
To see these things
To just believe in him
So occluded we
Choose not to see
What it means
And we'll fail to ask
Where we stand <start> Bad angel get off of my shoulder
Bad angel let me be
I'm standing at the cross roads
Of Temptation and Salvation Street
I woke up bound and determined
That I would not light it up today
But one drag would stop my shakin'
Right now I could go either way
Bad angel get off of my shoulder now
Bad angel let me be
I'm standing at the cross roads
Of Temptation and Salvation Street
Well the cap is on the bottle
And the bottle is on the shelf
Should I take it or leave it
Honey how am I gonna help myself
Bad angel get off of my shoulder 
Bad angel let me be 
I'm standing at the cross roads
Of Temptation and Salvation Street
That's right
Well I know I should not gamble
'Cause I can't afford to lose
She'd hang me from the rafters
Put the laces in my old working shoes
Oh bad angel get off of my should 
Bad angel let me be
I'm standing at the cross roads
Of Temptation and Salvation Street
Yes I'm standing at the cross roads
Of Temptation and Salvation
Temptation and Salvation
Temptation and Salvation Street

Yeah ha ha ha ha <start> Found myself today I took my cross up and walked away
With amazing grace and opened eyes
Even though I'm born to lose my way
Tomorrow comes on a hurricane
When the weight of the world's been on your mind
In the morrow I'll be gone
I gave it everything I had for so long
Save your sorrow for your song
Don't we always find a way to carry on
No ones sees it coming
And no one walks when they should've been running
And nothing hurts like knowing you've tried
And we can see how years can slip away
In the cold dark nights and the long hard days
But nothing aches quite like goodbye
In the morrow I'll be gone
I gave it everything I had for so long
Save your sorrow for your song
Don't we always find a way to carry on
In the morrow I'll be gone
I gave it everything I had for so long
Save your sorrow for your song
Don't we always find a way
In the morrow I'll be gone
I gave it everything I had for so long
Save your sorrow for your song
Don't we always find a way to carry on
Don't we always find a way to carry on <start> Take your time
But if you waste it
Take mine too
I don't mind
As long as you let me into your mind
My brain's a hazy place these days
Take your clothes off
Climb up into my bed
I'll take your money
I'll steal your oxygen
Can you see
All of my boundless treachery
I fell to zero at least it must have been
You're just a hero I need a heroin
Unchained black melodies gaining strain
I don't mind but certainly
I don't mean to boast
But you're divine
You got me feelin' comatose
My friend I fear we're drawing near the end
I watch the shadows
They dance across the wall
I follow blindly
Chased them down the hall
I see monsters in my periphery <start> You over think things
You say what if we're not meant to be
Well you know what so what
Make a mistake with me
Nobody goes through this life and does
Everything perfectly
We're all gonna fail so you might as well
Make a mistake with me
Sometimes baby when we take
A chance that has this much at stake
We look back and in hindsight
What seemed wrong looks more like right
So I say worst case we'll be left with
Lots of good memories
This chance we have well it's worth that
So make a mistake with me <start> He was always there each time I needed you
Holding on to me like I held on to you
We still don't have what you and I once had
No It's Not Love But it's not bad.
No It's Not Love not like our love It's Not Love
But it keeps love from driving me mad
And I don't have to wonder who he's had
No It's Not Love But it's not bad
I turn to him when you leave me alone
Sometimes even when you're here you're still gone.
He'e slowly changing what you leave so sad
No It's Not Love But it's not bad
No It's Not Love not like our love It's Not Love
But it keeps love from driving me mad
And I don't have to wonder who he's had <start> The sun is up the time's at hand
There's a stir across the land
So begins another day
On life's highway
On city streets down country roads
Like a stream the people flow
There's bread to win and tolls to pay
On life's highway
Chorus
There is hope with every turn
A bridge to build a bridge to burn
Here's hoping you never go astray
On life's highway
We are young then we're old
Passing through then passing on
Like roses bloom and fade
On life's highway
Chorus
Step by step round and round
Never knowing where we're bound
From the cradle to the grave
On life's highway <start> Each new day brings heartaches by the number
A memory of things that used to be
And each night alone I remember those kisses
That your lips once gave to me
Chorus
Take me back again make me live again
Say those things you used to say to me
Kiss these lips of mine just like old times darling
Take me back again again again
Day and night my love for you grows stronger
Every hour is filled with thoughts of you
And though you say that you love me no longer
That won't stop my arms from wanting you
Chorus <start> Take your suitcase and take your heart
Take a train to the boulevard
My love will follow you my love will follow you
You can try to lose yourself downtown
You can burn all your bridges down
My love will follow you
Yeah my love will follow you
Chorus
My love will follow you
Down every highway or your soul
You can leave me far behind
But my love will be your shadow
Everywhere you go
So close to the door turn in the key
Leave me here like a memory
My love will follow you my love will follow you
Even on a road that takes you down where
Cords of human kindness come unwound
My love will follow you
Yeah my love will follow you
Chorus
If you should go so far that you cannot get back
Girl you may not remember
But my heart will not lose track
So go ahead and take that train
In my heart you'll still remain
My love will follow you my love will follow you
My love will follow you
Oh follow you
My love will follow you <start> Troublesome waters around me do roll
They're rockin' my boat and wreckin' my soul
Loved ones are driftin' and livin' in sin
The treacherous whirlpools are pullin' them in
When troublesome waters are rollin' so high
I lift up my voice and to heaven I cry
Lord I am trustin' give guidance to me
And steady my boat on life's troubled sea.
Troublesome waters are blacker than night
Hiding from view the harbor light bright
Out on the ocean I seem as a speck
Awful sea monsters are waiting my wreck
Gently I feel the touch of his hand
Guiding my boat to that better land
Leading way to heaven's bright shore
Troublesome waters I'm fearing no more
Troublesome waters around me now roll
Rocking my boat and tempting my soul
Loved ones are drifting and living in sin
Treacherous whirlpools are pulling them in
Sin waves are tossing and dashing so high
Over this noise you hear my sad cry
Lord I am trusting show mercy to me
Steady my lifeboat while I am at sea <start> Blue railroad train
I'm goin' down the railroad track
It makes me feel so doggone blue
To listen to that old smokestack
Drivers arollin' on
Leavin' me here behind
And give me back them good old days
And let me ramble down the line
Blue railroad train
Leavin' me here alone
You're treatin' me good
You're treatin' me bad
And makin' me think of home
I hear that lonesome train
And love to hear the whistle blow
She's takin' the sun
And leavin' the rain
And makin' me wanna go
I've got the blues
Longin' for her company
It's many miles from where I am
To the only one for me
It's so lonesome here
Waitin' for the manifest
I hope that engineer is kind
Enough to let me be his guest
Blue railroad train
A good old pal to me
Take me everywhere I wanna go
Get my transportation free <start> Well I love you and I don't care who knows it
Thare ain't nothing that I wouldn't do show it
Well I'd climb upon the rooftops and I'd shout it
Hey I'd gladly tell the whole darn world about it
Well the Man in the Moon he's gonna see it and the fishes in the oceans gonna feel it
Well the birds and the bees are gonna hear it
And you can't make nothing out of that but love
Well I've heard love called a lot of things and sometimes it can turn into bad seeds
There's some say that it's just a waste of time
But it's too late now you've done blown my mind
And I love you and I don't care who knows it
There ain't nothin' that I wouldn't do show it
The birds and the bees already know it
And you can't make nothing out of that but love
No you can't make nothing out of that but love <start> Shackled by a heavy burden beneath a load of guilt and shame
Then the hand of Jesus touched me and now I am no longer the same
He touched me yes he touched me and all the joy that floods my soul
Something happened and now I know he touched me and made me whole
 organ 
Since I met that blessed Saviour oh since he cleansed and made me whole
I will never cease to praise him I'll shout it while eternity rolls
Cause he touched me... <start> Come In Out From The Cold
Take Off Your Coat Brush Off The Snow
Leave All Your Bags Outside The Door
You Wont Need Them With Me Anymore
Skin I Want To Get Down To Your Skin
Dont Stop Me From Coming In
Take Off Your Skin
Slip Out From Your Shell Abandon Your Name
Peel Off Your Layers Dont Be Afraid
Come And Lie Down Breathe In My Breath
I Want To Drown Drown In Your Flesh
Skin Theres Nothing Between Us But
Skin Dont Stop Me From Coming In
Take Off Your Skin
I Want To Get Deeper I Need Even More
I Want To Dance With Your Soul Deep In Your Core
I Try To Swim Through Your Eyes And Crawl Through Your Kiss
But I Cant Seem To Reach You Your Body Resists
Skin Theres Nothing Between Us But
Skin Stopping Me From Coming In
Take Off Your Skin
I Wish I Could Meet You Some Place Other Than Here
Where The World Would Fade And Wed Both Disappear <start> For my girls
The fighters the warriors
Broken glass inside
Won't cut
Through me
Pain behind my eyes
I turn
Into strength
Oh I will fight
I will survive
I am invincible
I am unbreakable
I am a diamond cut to last
I am unstoppable
I am a hero
Like a phoenix from the ash
Woah
Invincible
Cracks run through these walls
But they still stand strong
Oh heart covered in scars
But my fear
Is gone
Oh I will fight
I will survive
I am invincible
I am unbreakable
I am a diamond cut to last
I am unstoppable
I am a hero
Like a phoenix from the ash
Woah
Nothin' gonna make me break or shatter
No one's gonna tell me I don't matter no
I won't let you
Time is runnin' out keeps gettin' faster
Gotta find a way rewrite the answers
'Till I can say
I am invincible
I am unbreakable
I am a diamond cut to last
I am unstoppable
I am a hero
Like a phoenix from the ash
I am invincible
I am unbreakable
I am a diamond that will last
Woah
Woah
Invincible <start> 
There are songs I love that catch my breath
When the first chord starts to play
Effortless and true it's funny but I knew
You would always touch my heart that way
And it hurts so much to let you go
And there are no words to say
But the corner of your smile says all I need to know
You could always touch my heart that way
Sail on my love life is only a blink in time
Go on and show all those stars what it means to shine
Like a fire that spins inside a spark
As the ashes cool to grey
Kicked up by the wind dancing through the dark
You will always touch my heart that way
Instrumental
Sail on my sweet love this world is a blink in time
Go on and show all those stars what it means to shine
And I know your love is here with me
I can feel you every day
Even if the beauty of your face I cannot see
Only you could touch my heart that way
You can always touch my heart that way <start> I got a letter from my mama just a line or two
She said listen daddy your good girl's leavin' you
That's all she wrote didn't write no more
She'd left the gloom a hanging round my front door
Now I woke up this morning a quarter past three
I just couldn't realize this could happen to me
That's all she wrote
Now listen pretty mama you know you done me wrong
Didn't even give a warning till after you were gone
That's all you wrote
Now someday you'll be sorry your heart will ache with pain
You'd give a million dollars to write that note again
That's all you wrote
Now listen all you ramblers who think your girl is true
Don't ever be too certain or you'll be singing too
That's all she wrote <start> I let my mind wander
And what did it do
I just kept right on goin'
Until it got right to you
Can't trust it one minute
It's worst than a child
This old face without conscience
And it's driving me wild
When I let my mind wander
I try to keep my mind busy
With thoughts of today but
In terrible memories
Seem to lure it away
My lonely heart wonders
If there'll ever come a day
When I can be happy
But I can't see no way
Cause I let my mind wander <start> Chorus
I'm loving you baby
Loving me Loving you Loving me
And I'm inclined just to let it be let it be
I'm a loving you loving you lovin me
Well I'm loving you baby loving you
Loving you loving me
And I'm inclined just to let it be let it be
I'm a loving you loving you loving me
Once was living life alone
Once was living but the life was gone
Once my life was just a bad routine
When you're doing it by yourself life's such a lonely thing
Chorus x <start> Love's a gamble every heart will take
You roll the dice in hopes that it won't break
One night I bet on your blue eyes and took a chance
And won a whole lot more than one night of romance
Chorus
I won the ace of heartsthat night in the dark
How lucky can one man be
I hold the winning hand any way life deals the cards
No way to lose cause I've got you my ace of hearts
Love's a numbered wheel you have to spin
There's no need for me to spin again
Cause loving you is paying off more than I knew
I took a little risk and hit it big with you
Chorus <start> Well I gotta get drunk
And I sure do dread it
'Cause I know just what I'm gonna do
I'll start to spend my money
Calling everybody honey
And wind up singing the blues
I'll spend my whole paycheck
On some old wreck
And brother I can name you a few
But I gotta get drunk
And I sure do dread it
'Cause I know just what I'm gonna do
I gotta get drunk I can't stay sober
There's a lot of good people in town
Who'd like to hear me holler
See me spend my dollars
And I wouldn't think of lettin' 'em down
There's a lot of doctors that tell me
That I'd better start to slowin' it down
But there's more old drunkers
Than there are old doctors
So I guess we'd better have another round
Well now I gotta get drunk
And I sure do dread it
'Cause I know just what I'm gonna do
I'll start to spend my money
Calling everybody honey
And wind up singing the blues
I'll spend my whole paycheck
On some old wreck
And brother I can name you a few
Well I gotta get drunk
And I sure do dread it
'Cause I know just what I'm gonna do
Well I gotta get drunk
And I sure do dread it
'Cause I know just what I'm gonna do
I'll start to spend my money
Calling everybody honey
And wind up singing the blues
I'll spend my whole paycheck
On some old wreck
And brother I can name you a few
Well I gotta get drunk
And I sure do dread it
'Cause I know just what I'm gonna do <start> You are a sunbeam and you will shine forever
Forever in our hearts now that you're gone
You are a sunbeam and you will shine wherever
Wherever your soul decides to roam
I wish you could have stayed a little longer
And shone more of your sunlight in our lives
But having known you I can feel a little stronger
Remembering the sunshine in your eyes
Sunbeam you are gone but not forgotten
You I'll carry with me everyday
I'll think about the smile you smiled so often
Until I see you once again someday
You are a sunbeam and you will shine forever
Forever in my heart now that you're gone
You are a sunbeam and you will shine wherever
Wherever your soul decides to roam
I wish you could have stayed a little longer
And shone more of your sunlight in our lives
But having known you I can feel a little stronger
Remembering the sunshine in your eyes
Sunbeam you are gone but not forgotten
You I'll carry with me everyday
I'll think about the smile you smiled so often
Until I see you once again someday <start> There is grime on my face
There is crust in my eye
There is no one in this place
But no one said goodbye
This is how I start
Another day in my kingdom
There is hate in my heart
This is how my day starts
There is blood in my hands
From the murder of a man
This is how I start
Another day in my kingdom
This is how I start
Another day in my kingdom
And where is my queen
She's as gone as can be
She was a fine lookin' lady
And she liked to go down on me
And I liked to go down on her too
In India there's the Taj
On good times there was Rog
And here look and see all there is is me
This is how I start
Another day in my kingdom
This is how I start
Another day in my kingdom
There are good times to be had
Only insanes really bad
The Lord and I agree
It's not too off to be what we are
As long as were royalty
You fuck and what's to do

It's not your kingdom too <start> 
Those other years the dusty years
We drove the big hers through
I tried to forget the miles we rode
And Spanish Johnny too
He'd sit beside a water ditch when all this herd was in
And he'd never harm a child but sing to his mandolin
The old talk the old ways and the dealin' of our game
But Spanish Johnny never spoke but sing a song of Spain
And his talk with men was vicious talk
When he was drunk on gin
Ah but those were golden things he said to his mandolin
We had to stand we tried to judge we had to stop him then
For the hand so gentle to a child had killed so many men
He died a hard death long ago before the road come in
And the night before he swung he sung to his mandolin
