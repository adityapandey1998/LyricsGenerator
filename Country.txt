I hear a call
Now will answer
Forsake my all
To serve another
Though darkness falls
Stay a believer
I hear a call
Now will answer
I see a light Now will I follow
Fill up this life
That grows more hollow
Make joy reside
Where there lives sorrow
I see a light
Now will follow
I hear a call
From out of nowhere
And from anywhere I go
I hear a call
Now will answer
I feel a touch
Now will I hold on
Be there with love
For those with no one
With a kindness such
It lives though I'm gone
I feel a touch
Now will I hold onSneaking out the bedroom
Cursing, tripping on his stuff
Looking for my car keys
While I'm pulling my jeans up
I make sure I'm out before
I turn my phone back on
I've got five missed calls
Can't believe what I just did
I lost myself tonight
But I just gotta get to you
The guilt's making me drive
I stumble in, I wake you up
But when you look at me
I just can't speak
'Cause you're the only one, the only one
Who ever gave a damn
And it's killing me to know you think
I'm better than I am
Came over here to tell the truth
But looking in your eyes
Baby sometimes, it's easier to lie
You know that I've been crying
So you ask what's going on
Your arm's around my shoulder
You got no clue what I've done
'Cause you don't see the guilt in me
And that just makes it worse
Yeah, that just makes it worse
'Cause you're the only one, the only one
Who ever gave a damn
And it's killing me to know you think
I'm better than I am
Came over here to tell the truth
But looking in your eyes
Baby sometimes, it's easier to lie
It's easier to lie, oh
It's so easy
I can't believe what I just did
I lost myself tonight
Because you're the only one, the only one
Who ever gave a damn
And it's killing me to know you think
I'm better than I am
Came over here to tell the truth
But looking in your eyes
Baby sometimes, it's easier to lie
'Cause you're the only one, the only one
Who ever gave a damn
And it's killing me to know you think
I'm better than I am
Came over here to tell the truth
But looking in your eyes
Baby sometimes, it's easier to lieOn my ride to you
Where am I gonna go
When you're gone
Someday soon we'll all move through
This car won't bring me back to you
Oh no
I look for you in your chair
out the window and in my hair uh huh
Breathe my whisper now old friend
Cause now soon will end
Remember my long brown hair
and the way I loved you everywhere
Oh oh me oh my
where you goin' without me
You found me all around
up the country
and way down town uh huh
One day we vowed till the end
together forever weave and bend uh huh
Close your eyes and feel the wind
This time I wont feel the wind
Remember my long brown hair
and the way I loved you everywhere
On my ride to you
Where am I gonna go
When you're gone?
I feel you hangin' on my frame
I smell your body
I spell your name, uh-huh
Beneath my hands
you'd move so free
These hands wont bring you
back to me oh no
Someday soon we'll all move through
This car won't bring me back to you
Remember my long brown hair
and the way I loved you everywhere
Oh oh me oh my
where you going without
On my ride to you
On my ride to you
Where am I gonna go
When you're gone?What colour is the wind, Daddy
Is it yellow, red or blue
When he's playing with my hair, Daddy
Does he do the same to you
When he's dying does his colour fade
Is a gentle breeze a lighter shade
Just like his friend the sea
The wind feels blue to me
-------
When the blackbird starts to sing, Daddy
Do the flowers hear him, too
When he's pouring out his heart, Daddy
Tell me, what do roses do
Do they cast their scent upon the air
And is fragrance just a rose in prayer
Giving thanks to God above
For the blackbird's song of love
-------
CHORUS:
Blow, wind, blow
Wild and free
My Daddy says
You're a lot like me
I know each colour
Its shape and size
I've seen them all
With my Daddy's eyes
-------
I know that grass is green, Daddy
I've touched it with my toes
And snow is purest white, Daddy
I've felt it with my nose
But my favorite colour has to be
The colour of your love for me
And Daddy, I've been told
That love is always gold
-------
REPEAT CHORUS:
My Daddy says
You're a lot like me
What colour is the windSomewhere deep inside something's got a hold of you. It's pushing me aside. See it stretch on forever.
I know I'm right for the first time in my life. That's why I tell you, you better be home soon. It's stripping back the cause of lies and deception, back to nothing else like a week in the desert. I know I'm right for the first time in my life. That's why I tell you, you better be home soon. Don't say no, don't say nothing's wrong, cause when you get back home, baby I'll be gone.
It would cause me pain if we were to end it, but I could start again. You can depend on it. I know I'm right for the first time in my life. That's why I tell you, you better be home soon. That's why I tell you, you better be home soon, soooon.(G) I could see it coming a (D) long time ago

That I'd never be unhappy, left (D) cryin' a-(G)-lone

(G) I know, that I'm a fool, but (D) what can I do

My dreams are all shattered, how (G7) can I go (C) on
With (D) no one to love me, just (D7) cryin' a-(G)-loneYeah man, that sure is one big old rock
It takes up half of that velvet box
I know you've given this a lot of thought
You're gonna get a 'yes' for sure
That thing is more than just a simple stone
It's got some crazy powers all its own
Something will happen when she slips it on
They never tell ya at the jewelry store
Yep, diamonds make babies
And babies make mammas
And mammas make daddies make changes they don't always wanna
I know that you love her
She's one special lady
But I'm warning you brother
Yep, diamonds make babies
You'll talk about it on the honeymoon
You'll both agree that it's way too soon
Next thing you know she's seein' pink and blue
Everywhere she goes
Yep, diamonds make babies
And babies make mammas
And mammas make daddies make changes they don't always wanna
I know that you love her
She's one special lady
But I'm warning you brother
Yep, diamonds make babies
Oh, yes they do
Yep, diamonds make babies
And babies make mammas
And mammas make daddies make changes they don't always wanna
I know that you love her
She's one special lady
But I'm warning you brother
Yep, diamonds make babies

But diamonds make babies

And I tell them, we love each other
There's really nothing to it
It's easy, we love each other so
And we always will, and I know
We found it long ago, and now, it's sure
That it's the kind to last forever
They ask me, can we make it'
And I tell them, we love each other
If there's trouble, can we take it'
And I tell them, we love each other
More than we ever have before
And they should know
When they ask us, how we do itLong ago when but a boy at old camp meetin' time
How my heart would beat with joy to hear the old bells chime
Callin' all the saints of God into the house of prayer
Oh such prayin' singin' shoutin' for the Lord was there
How I like the old time preachin' prayin' shoutin' singin'
How I like the old time readin' of God's words
How I like to hear that glory hallelujah singin'
How I like the old time worship of the Lord
[ guitar ]
How I like the old time...
[ guitar ]
Preachin' in them good ole days was still the world acclaim
Preachin' for the souls of men and not for wordly fame
Under such old fashion preachin' sinners knelt and pray
And the Lord would save them in that good ole fashion way
How I like the old time...Oh the pain of loving you oh the mis'ry I go through
Never knowing what to do oh the pain of loving you
You just can't stand to see me happy seems you hurt me all you can
Still I go on loving you but I'll never understand
Oh the pain of loving you...
[ ac.guitar - steel ]
To love and hate at the same time the line between the two is fine
But too has bound me heart and soul so strong that I can't let you go
Oh the pain of loving you...
Oh the pain of loving youThey say don't go on Wolverton Mountain,
If you're looking for a wife.
Cause Clifton Clowers
Has a pretty young daughter
He's mighty handy
With a gun and a knife.
Her tender lips
Are sweeter than honey
and Wolverton Mountain
Protects her there
The bears and the birds
Tell Clifton Clowers
If a stranger should wander there.
I'm going up
On Wolverton Mountain
It's mighty lonesome
Down here below
It's just not right
To hide his daughter
From the one who loves her soI built a fire up on the hill; I sat in the woods and drank my fill
Talked to God all night, took another shot at setting me right
Then I walked down to the road, filled a beer can full of 22 holes
Then I said goodbye, yeah I said goodbye
[Chorus]
I'd go back but I can't go home, cause river is up and the road is closed
And there ain't no telephone ? at my mothers' house
And all the lights are out, down on the rural route
There ain't much of nothin' left, this place where I became myself
Ghosts and memories, I'd walk on by but they'd follow me
I'd seen plenty on down the road. Asked him if he'd seen my brother
He just said no, well I guess I'd better go
[Chorus]
I built a fire up on the hill; I sat in the woods and drank my fill
Talked to God all night, took another shot at setting me right
Then I'd just walk away, ain't nothin' here I want to remember anyway
Least not today
[Chorus: x2]I cried a tear, you wiped it dry
I was confused, you cleared my mind
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me
You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world, out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I can almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me
And I can't believe it's you, I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave? I'd be a fool
Cause I've finally found someone who really cares
You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost, you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me friend
You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I can almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me
You needed me, you needed me
You needed me, you needed meI'm walking your streets again big city searching every face that I see
Looking for my darling big city the one that you took away from me
You lured her with your night life big city to take her from me you know it was wrong
I'm searching night and day for her big city oh without her love I just can't go on
[ guitar ]
You took my love away from me big city stole her out of my two loving arms
You know I'm gonna hate you big city if you brought my baby any harm
So I'm walking your streets...
The one that you took away from meOnce I had a heart cold as ice
Love to me was only for a fun
I'd make a mark for each broken heart
Like notches on the butt of a gun
Once I had a trick up my sleeve
And a reputation all over town
I was heartless and cold wherever I'd go
And I shot down every young girl I found
Yes, I used to be a moonlight bandit
I used to be a heartbreak kid
Then I met you and the next thing I knew, there I was
Oh, shot full of love
Well who'd have thought that someone like you
Could take a desperado like me
But oh, here I am as meek as a lamb
With my bleeding heart there at your feet
Yes, I used to be a moonlight bandit
I used to be a heartbreak kid
Then I met you and the next thing I knew, there I was
Oh, shot full of love, shot full of love
Yes, I used to be a moonlight bandit
I used to be a heartbreak kid
Then I met you and the next thing I knew, there I was
Oh, shot full of love, shot full of love
Shot full of love, shot full of love
Shot full of love, shot full of love
Shot full of love, shot full of loveTo know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
I'll be good to him
I'll bring love to him
Everyone says there'll come a day
When I'll walk alongside of him
Yes just to know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
Why can't he see
How blind can he be
Someday he will see
That he was meant for me
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I doSadie?s Song
Pretty boy, my faithless fallen angel
Took me completely in his arms
In his eyes, I saw Eden?s garden
But the serpent lay hidden in his charms
Well I used to love to sing with the sunlight in my hair
Til that fateful day when I followed him there
He said, climb, little Sadie higher
Spread them downy wings and fly
You will find your crown of gilded glory next to mine
Climb, little Sadie, climb
Icy winds up on Lookout Mountain
Chilled two bodies to the bone
But for that man, I did gladly lay down my back
Upon a bed of stone
Well I used to love to sing with the sunlight in my hair
Til that fateful day when I followed him therecome and go as I please.
From down here, up North and inbetween,
But baby it's a shame 'cause I always feel the same
When I can't see Texas from here.
[Chorus:]
I can't see Texas from here.
No matter how I try, it makes me want to cry.
So if you see me lookin' down,
I'm tryin' not to show this frown
'Cause I can't see Texas from here.
I can't say I don't like Tennessee.
The people here have all been good to me.
So please don't take offense if I start to get intense
Just 'cause I can't see Texas from here.
[Chorus: x2]Please help me, I'm falling in love with you
Close the door to temptation, don't let me walk through
Turn away from me, darling, I'm begging you to
Please help me, I'm falling in love with you
I belong to another, whose arms have grown cold
I promised forever to have and to hold
I can never be free, dear, but when I'm with you
I know that I'm losing the will to be true
Please help me, I'm falling in love with you
Close the door to temptation, don't let me walk through
Turn away from me, darling, I'm begging you to
Please help me I'm falling in love with you
Please help me I'm falling in love with youMomma played piano in a Pentecostal church
Starin' them snakes in the eye
Daddy died drunk, left us all in a lurch
Hell I did what I did to get by
I did what I did to get by
A third grade education won't bring you no luck
When you're looking for a way to get paid
Turned 14 and stole a pickup truck
Couldn't make it on minimum wage
Couldn't make it on minimum wage
Well I almost got caught in Tulsa town
I had me one foot in the grave
Ah they're gonna die trying to track me down
But they'll never catch Monroe Suede
No they'll never catch Monroe Suede
Well you can't stay long when you're living on the run
And the high sheriff's lookin' for you
Never shot nobody with a loaded gun
But I found me a lover or two
Well I almost got caught in Tulsa town
I had me one foot in the grave
Ah they're gonna die trying to track me down
But they'll never catch Monroe Suede
No they'll never catch Monroe Suede
Momma still plays piano in the same ol' church
Helpin' them sinners get saved
Daddy died drunk, left us all in a lurch
And they call me Monroe Suede
Well I almost got caught in Tulsa town
I had me one foot in the grave
Ah they're gonna die trying to track me down
But they'll never catch Monroe Suede
No they'll never catch Monroe Suede
They'll never catch Monroe SuedeHere's my keys, I want you to take 'em
I think I'm gonna need you to get back home
Hold on to my hat, I don't wanna lose it
I couldn't stand for something else to be gone
I'm sure you know the reason I'm here cryin'
I think you'll understand why
[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm the designated drinker
I just lost the one that wrapped me around her finger
I need to get to where I can't think of her
So tonight, I'm the designated drinker
I came here to get you to help me
I need a friend to see me through
I hated to call, I knew you wouldn't mind at all
I know you know I'd do the same for you
I'm not the kind that likes to drown my sorrow
I may hate myself tomorrow
Oh but
[Chorus]LEAVE ALL THE HEARTACHE TO ME

RECORDED BY KITTY WELLS
If two other lips are what you long for
If our love is melodrama that just can't be
Go on out with someone else enjoy living
And leave all the heartache to me
I'll stay home and count the teardrops while you go out and party
I'll envy you for being so carefree
You can laugh and love with her and be contented
And leave all the heartache to me
Don't think upon our romance as a failure
Don't hate yourself for wanting to be free
Just look forward don't look backward and be happy
And leave all the heartache to me
I'll stay home and count the teardrops while you go out and party
I'll find comfort in a few old memories
You can laugh and love with her and be contented
And leave all the heartache to meWritten by billy burnette and mentor williams.
I've been waitin' on you all summer long
Oh without you everything's been
Goin' wrong
I know I've played around but I think i've
Had enough
I know I've let you down
But givin' that all up
I'm gettin' back to where I can see
Remembering the way it used to be
Getting' back to love-gettin' back to you
And me
Baby your shadow follows me everywhere
Maybe tomorrow I'll see you
Standing there
With your arms open - you eyes
Touching mine
Honey I'm hopin' I'm not runnin' blind
Getting back to where I can see
Remembering the way it used to be
'cause I'm gettin' back to love-gettin'
Back to you and me
People are fallin' in and out of love so fast
It don't have to be that way
This time we'll make it last
Gettin' back to where I can see
Remembering the way it used to be
'cause I'm gettin' back to love
Gettin' back to you and me
'cause I'm getting back to love
Gettin' back to you and me(Rodney Crowell)
This morning is Monday where are you now
Teasin' my memory teaching me how to lay low
When I don't want to
Well love is elusive this I know now
It's making me crazy leaving me out
In the open when I don't want to
The moments of pleasures Never do last
Are gone like a suitcase full of your past
Long gone and in a hurry
Baby, I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down more then I've already been
Just like a wild fire you're running all over town
As much as you burn me baby I should be ashes by now
The second street beggars alone in their life
Drunk on a sidewalk to hide from the night
Like I am They're just like I am
Baby, I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down more then I've already been
Just like a wild fire you're running all over town
As much as you burn me baby I should be ashes by now
Just like a wild fire You're running all over town
As much as you burn me, baby I should be ashes by now
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah I should be ashes by nowWell a few years back me and ol' John worked the Calgary rodeo.
We were hangin' around town with nothing to do, nowhere else to go.
Cowboys are known for their fun loving ways, pranks, and practical jokes. And I'll never forget the night we impressed a bunch of them Calgary folks. Well just down the hall in the ole hotel where me and old John stayed.
Were some school marms, they'd come up from Dallas to party for a couple of days.
Now these old gals was fancy dressers; they had wigs and beads and all.
So we put on the hair, took off our boots, and boogied on down the hall. Well, you could never tell we were cowboys; we were real lookin' hippies by heck. With long hair, bare feet, old t-shirts, and beads around our necks. And shoot we just had to show someone so we boogied on down to the lounge. There was cowboys, and gents in nice old suits and ladies in long evening gowns. Well we found us a table, pulled out a chair and lit up some Bull Durham smokes. The smoke filled the air, everyone there thought these hippies were smokin' dope. Now Leonard and Cravy and old Ronnie
Rosland were sitting two tables away. So we did what we thought hippies would do when we noticed them lookin' our way. Well we waved our long hair, rolled back our eyes, and sucked in them home made smokes. Sayin' stuff like cool and ya, man wow. We put on one heck of a show. Now Ronnie and Lenard, they'd been there a while and they wasn't feelin' much pain. I reckon they figured they'd have some fun with these two hippie freaks that walked in. Well the bar got deathly quiet, as those cowboys come our way. And the city folks knew it wouldn't be long till the battle got under way. Well Ronnie came right over to me and looked me right square in the eye and said, hey there boy, what's that stuff you're smokin' I Said, here man give it a try. Well that didn't make him too happy, and then when I told him to bug out he blinked and snorted like a mad brahamer bull, frolicked and foamed at the mouth. Well just about then, I looked at old John and his face had turned beat red, cause Leonard had grabbed him by the throat with plans to tear off his head! Ronnie reached out with a huge left hand and grabbed a hold of my hair. With a right fist cocked, he said now boy you better start sayin' your prayers!
Well he gave a yank and my wig come off and lay limp there across his hand.
The most stupified look I've never seen on the face of any man. Well he
Dropped the thing like a poisonous snake and stared at it there on the floor.
The he looked up and saw who I was, he laughed, and gave out a roar!
Well this story doesn't have any moral; it was just one mighty good gag. But I sighed with relief Ronnie didn't swing first before he pulled off my wig.I cheated on you dear and it's no secret cause you made sure that everybody knew
But you just told them your side of the story
Cause you knew I would never tell on you
I love you much too much to tell them what you've done
I'd never let them know you cheated too
So you just tell 'em your side of the story and you know I will never tell on you
[ steel ]
It doesn't seem to matter that I'm sorry I've begged you to forgive a thousand times
But you're still telling your side of the story
Cause and you know I will never tell 'em mine
I love you much too much...We're looking for The King
The new Messiah
We're following the star
Shining brighter
Old man won't you help us if you can
He shook his head
But he pointed his hand
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem
I see you've traveled far
Bearing treasures
You say these gifts are for
The new Kings pleasures
Well I've heard
That a King might come
But up 'til now there hasn't been one
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in BethlehemWhen my grandad fell in love with my grandma
Hearts were made to last, hearts were strong
But over the years they must have changed somehow
Look at us now, something must be wrong.
They dont make hearts like they used to
These days a heart aint worth a dime
They dont make hearts like they used to
Theyre breaking all the time
When my folks fell in love, they had no doubt
Whatever came their way, they would just work out
Now someones breaking up, every time you turn around
No one seems to know what love is all about
They dont make hearts like they used to
These days a heart aint worth a dime
They dont make hearts like they used to
Theyre breaking all the time
It theres any hope for us to last for long
Then weve got to find the kind of love
Old hearts were built upon
They dont make hearts like they used to
These days a heart aint worth a dime
They dont make hearts like they used to
Theyre breaking all the timeWhen I was younger, the hunger came calling
And humbly I answered each rising and falling
I will not surrender at this wiser and tender age
I turn the page
[Chorus]
And I sing for Joy
For the smile that it brings, from the heart
Through these guitar strings
It was only noise, till her love put a song
In the soul of this good ole boy
I sing for Joy
When I was lonely, my angel found me
She sweetly and gently wrapped her arms around me
And the demons that chased me, gave up and faded away
Now I can sing
[Chorus]
And I sing for Joy
For the smile that it brings, from the heart
Through these guitar strings
It was only noise, till her love put a song
In the soul of this good ole boy
I sing for Joy
Who could come nearer, to making life clearer
The time we're together grows dearer and dearer
When I must travel and I have to leave her alone
She's in my song
[Chorus]
And I sing for Joy
For the smile that it brings, from the heart
Through these guitar strings
It was only noise, till her love put a song
In the soul of this good ole boy
I sing for JoyAnd now the end is near and so I face the final curtain
My friend I'll say it clear I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full I've traveled each and every highway
And more much more than this I did it my way
Regrets I've had a few but then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each chartered course each careful step along the byway
And more much more than this I did it my way
Yes there were times I'm sure you knew when I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way
I've loved I've laughed and cried I've had my fill my share of losing
And now as tears subside I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that and may I say not in a shy way
Oh no oh no not me I did it my wayI fell in love on a moonlit night in the blue moon light of old Mexicali
I kissed red lips neath the blossoms of white in the blue moon light and I was so happy
Because I was happy I broke the vows I made to another
And I made promises I couldn't keep
Now I'm alone in the silent night and as blue moon light touches my pillow I weep
I weep for the heart that I've broken apart and the shame in my soul never die
For I promised that I'd be returning but I knew I was saying goodbye
For I wasn't free God forgive me only he knows what I feel inside
Because I was happy...I buried him down by the river
'cause that's where he liked to be
And every night when the moon is high
I go there and weep openly
He and I were married
By this river 'neath this willow tree
And with God and friends witnessing it
He pledged his life to me
To me he was Earth
And I rooted in his soil
I to he was Sky vast and free
Of the burdens from which he toiled
Then one night a terrible fight
Words spoken better left unsaid
With his wedding vows ringing in my ears
He gave his life to me
They say to love is to bury
Those demons from which we all hide
But tonight by this river 'neath this willow tree
Becoming one of Earth and SkySaturday night shes fancied up, love of her lifes come to pick her up
Theres things in the past she tries to forget
Will he be late be there at all, broken heart man its not her fault
Shes only in love cause shes shot through the heart
Chorus
There he goes, hes doing it again, hes out all night with all his friends
Shes on the couch, her head in her hands
6 AM. hes through the door, Dog house roses scattered on the floor
Shes falling apart, cause shes shot through the heart
Verse 2
How many times must she cry, through it all she stands by his side
He just cant shake monkey off his back
He knows hes wrong to make her cry, whoa and God knows how hard hes tried
To do right by her says its so dam hard
Chorus
Maybe someday hell straighten up, will it be too late, will she have her enough
Shes only in love, she says it so damn hard
She wont be there to watch him die, packs those bags with tear drops in her eyes
Shes leaving him because shes shot through the heart
Chorus 2:
There he goes hes doing it again, hes out all night with all his friends
Shes in her car, her head in her hands
6 am, through the door, dog house roses, they dont work anymore
Cuz her note says good bye cause Im shot through the heart
No more cryin, no, no, cause Im shot through the heartHaven't you seen me sleepwalking 'cause I've been holding your hand
Haven't you noticed me drifting
Oh
Let me tell you I am
Tell me it's nothing
Try to convince me that I'm not drowning
Oh
Let me tell you I am
Please
Please tell me you know
I've got to let you go
I can't help falling out of love with you
Ooh
Why I am feeling so guilty
Why I am holding my breath
Worry about everyone but me and I just keep losing myself
Tell me it's nothing
Try to convince me that I'm not drowning
Oh
Let me tell you I am
Please
Please tell me you know
I've got to let you go
I can't help falling out of love with you
Won't you read my mind
Don't you make me like you
And I hear
Please
Please tell me you know
I've got to let you go
I can't help falling out of love with you
With you
Ooh
Ooh
Haven't you noticed
I'm sleepwalkingYou like to mix with people, I like to be alone
Baby you can stay out all night, and I'd just as well stay home
Two people with so little in common, and different as we can be
We come together around midnight when it's just you and me
When it's just you and me and there's nothing between us Oh, but our own sweet love
When it's time to be tender and try to remember what we're doin' here
Baby, I don't mind we're not two of a kind, just so we agree
Sometime long 'round midnight when it's just you and me
You love to hear the music, you just get up and dance around
Baby, you can act so crazy, you turn it up way too loud
Oh, I've got my share of hang-ups but you never seem to see
And as we come together 'round midnight when it's just you and me
When it's just you and me and there's nothing between us Oh, but our own sweet love
When it's time to be tender and try to remember what we're doin' here
Baby, I don't mind we're not two of a kind, just so we agree
Sometime long 'round midnight when it's just you and meYou get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Dusty head lights dance with your boots in it (dirt)
You write her name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your corn field, whiskey
Bonfires on it (dirt)
You bet your life on it
Its that elm shade
Red roads clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground That your dad
Damned his luck on That post game party field
You circled up on
And when it rains You get stuck on
Drift a cloud back Behind county roads
That you run up
The mud on her jeans that she peeled off
And hung up
Her blue eyed Summer time smile
Looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build
A 10 percent down
White picket fence house on this dirt
You've mixed some sweat with it
Taken a shovel to it
You've stuck some crosses and some painted
Goal posts through it (dirt)
You know you came from it (dirt)
And some day you'll return to
Its that elm shade
Red roads clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground that your dad
Damned his luck on that post game party field
You circled up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back Behind county roads
That you run up
The mud on her jeans that she peeled off
And hung up
Her blue eyed summer time smile
Looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build
A 10 percent down
White picket fence house on this dirt
You came from it,
And some day you'll return to
Its that elm shade
Red roads clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground that your dad
Damned his luck on that post game party field
You circled up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back Behind county roads
That you run up
The mud on her jeans that she peeled off
And hung up
Her blue eyed summer time smile
Looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build
A 10 percent down
White picket fence house on this dirt
Makes you wanna build
A 10 percent down
White picket fence house on this dirt
You came from it,
And some day you'll return to itI want to tell you all a story 'bout a harper valley widow wife
Who had a teenage daughter that attended harper valley junior high
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
And she said, "mama, i've got a note here from the harper valley pta"
Well the note says "mrs. johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
It's been reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin' wild
Now we don't believe you ought to be a bringin' up your little girl this way"
And it was signed by the secretary, harper valley pta
Well it happened that the pta was gonna meet that very afternoon
And boy, were they surprised as mrs. johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard i can still recall the word she had to say
She said "i'd like to address this meeting of the harper valley pta
Now there's bobby taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
And mrs. taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
And mr. baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't widow jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down
Now mr. harper couldn't be here 'cause he's stayed too long in kelly's bar again
And if you smell shirley thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me as a mother you think that i ain't fit
Well this is just a little payton place and you're all harper valley hypocrites(It's just a bend of the road)
Are you weary and tired of living does it all seem to be thankless giving
Don't worry my friend it isn't the end it's just a bend of the road
Have you reached for someone's hand and found that's she don't understand
Keep reaching my friend it isn't the end it's just a bend of the road
It's never the end there's always one more bend
Another day another way a year or two
So walk another mile remember with the smile happiness can afford to lose you
At times when you're feeling so lonely and you long to find someone to love you only
Keep looking my friend it isn't the end
There'll may be someone around the bend of the road
There'll may be someone around the bend of the roadLuck found me too late
To be what I could use
And caught me tempting fate
Still red handed and confused
Pride has sent me where
There's not much left to lose
Then cruelly let me care
And convinced me I could choose
[Chorus]
About you
As if there was one small chance
to be through
With everything I can't
So even if this worn-out heart was new
And all it's foolish hopes were true
This one lifetime just won't do
'Cause I cried enough tears for two
Dreamin' only served
To take my restless sleep
Steeling comfort from these eyes
So desperate for relief
Fueled by empty promises
They never meant to keep
Leaving me with nothing more
Than endless years to weep
[Chorus]Call me a dog when I'm gone, gone, gone
You call me a dog when I'm gone
But when I get back with a ten dollar bill
It's "Honey, where you been so long?"
Been all around old Kentucky and
The state of old Tennessee
And every place where I hang my hat
Is home sweet home to me
Daddy told me how to gamble
He taught me to play that jack and trey
Every time that the deal would go down
I'd look down on that deuce, ace and trey
Old black dog when I'm gone, gone, gone
You call me a dog when I'm gone
But when I get back with a ten dollar bill
It's "Honey, where you been so long?"
Whose gonna shoe your pretty little feet
Whose gonna glove your hand
Whose gonna kiss your rosy little cheeks
Tell me whose gonna be your man
Daddy will shoe my pretty little feet
Momma will glove my hand
Sister will kiss my rosy little cheeks
And I ain't gonna need a gambling man
Old black dog when I'm gone, gone, gone
You call me a dog when I'm gone
But when I get back with a ten dollar bill
It's "Honey, where you been so long?"One day, you'll look
To see I've gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun
One day, you'll know
I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know
Oh-oh-oh
One day, you'll find
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know
Oh-oh-oh
One day, you'll find
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sunAll my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
I'm standin' here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breakin', it's early morn
The taxi's waitin', he's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome, I could die
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
There are so many times, I've let you down
So many times, I've played around
I tell you now that they don't mean a thing
Every place I go, I'll think of you
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
When I come back, I'll bring your weddin' ring
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
The time has come to leave you alone
Let me kiss you so close your eyes
And honey, I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times, I won't have to say
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Leaving on a jet planeI'm going to take a trip in that old gospel ship
I'm a-going far beyond the sky
I'm gonna shout and sing til heaven rings
When I hid this world goodbye
I have good news to bring, and that is why I sing
All my joys with you I'll share
I'm going to take a trip in that old gospel ship
And go sailing through the air
I can scarcely wait, I know I won't be late
I'll spend my time in prayer
And when the ship comes in, I'll leave this world of sin
And go sailing through the air
If you are ashamed of me, you ought not to be
Yes, you'd better have a care
If too much fault you find, you will sure be left behind
While I'm sailing through the airI'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart
And as the door of love between us closes
Tears will fall like petals when we part
I begged you to be different but you'll always be untrue
I'm tired of forgiving now there's nothing left to do
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart
You've made our lover's lane a road of sorrow
Till at last we had to say goodbye
You're leaving me to face each new tomorrow
With a broken heart you taught to cry
I know that I should hate you after all you've put me through
But how can I be bitter when I'm still in love with you
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heartI think Im is a world of trouble
Talk about a worried man
I've seen enough women falling out of love
To know Ive got one on my hands
There must be something going on
That I dont know about
I got a feeling 'fore the weekends over
Shell be moving out
Oh, but so far so she hasnt packed a thing at all
She hasnt made a call, she must be thinking it over
So far so good she hasnt done what I thought she would
So far so good
Oh, the nights are the hardest to handle
So many things in my head
How much longer can I go on
Just taking a memory to bed
Im so afraid theres somebody else
Lord, I hope Im wrong
But I can't help feeling that one of these mornings
Ill be waking up alone
Oh, but so far so she hasnt packed a thing at all
She hasnt made a call, she must be thinking it over
So far so good she hasnt done what I thought she would
So far so good, so far, so far so goodWhen you feel the pain of loneliness inside you
And you feel the emptiness that lives within
When all the things around you had no meaning
And the lips you love can kiss you once and then
That's when love will mean the most
That's when love will hold you close
To the lips you love to touch and the things that mean so much
That's when love will mean the most
[ steel ]
When you see a gentle smile from one that loves you
I feel a softness in the touch of love's sweet hand
Or just reminiscing back through childhood mem'ries
Of days gone by that can't return again
TThat's when love will mean the most...The devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind
Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal
When he came across this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said boy let me tell you what
I guess you didn't know it
But I'm a fiddle player too
And if you care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
Cause I think I'm better than you
The boy said my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
Cause I'm the best there's ever been
Johnny rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia and the devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul.
The devil opened up his case
And he said I'll start this show
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow
Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made a [sic] evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this
When the devil finished
Johnny said well you're pretty good old son
Just sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done
He played Fire on the Mountain
Run boys, run
The devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in a bread pan picken' out dough
Granny does your dog bite
No child, no
The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said, Devil just come on back
If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a gun
I'm the best there's ever been
And he played Fire on the Mountain
Run boys, run
The devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in a bread pan picken' out dough
Granny will your dog bite/
No child, no(Dolly Parton)
If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really not
My kind of man
I don't believe you have the right
To ask me to be different
Either take me like I am
Or let me be
If you really love me
I mean, really loved or love me
You wouldn't want to change
One part of me
If you can't be satisfied with me
The way I am
If I can't make you happy
Find someone who can
If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really
Not my kind of man
I couldn't make you happy
If I let you change me
For I know you wouldn't love me
That-a way
I can only be myself
But if you want something else
Then I can see no reason
I should stay
If you can't be satisfied with me
The way I am
If I can't make you happy
Find someone who can
If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really
Not my kind of man
If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really
Not my kind of manA young boy needs a place to sit and wait
'Cause she ain't ever ready for the date
That girl's daddy needs a quiet spot
To tell that boy the what's and what nots
Someday soon he's gonna bring her home
They'll sit on the swing with that light bulb on
He'll reach in the pocket of his ole blue jeans
Pull out a ring, get down on one knee
That's why god made a front porch
Put a little creak in the screen door
Something 'bout the sound of a g-chord
Foot tappin' on a loose board
Moon dancin' behind the willow tree
You can hear that bullfrog clear across the creek
That ole house gets a little warm
That's why god made a front porch
I step over my ole dog and head to work
Put in a full day till my back hurts
As fast as this world goes 'round and 'round
Everybody needs a place to slow down
As my tires hit the gravel drive
The summer sun's hangin' on for dear life
There's my little angel in her sun dress
Sittin' cross-legged on the wood steps
That's why god made a front porch
Put a little creak in the screen door
Something 'bout the sound of a g-chord
Foot tappin' on a loose board
Wind chimes jangle in the evening breeze
You can hear that bullfrog clear across the creek
A peaceful rain follows a thunderstorm
That's why god made a front porchYeah
In the circles I've been running
I've covered many miles
And I could search forever for what's right before my eyes
Just when I thought I'd found it
It was nothing like I'd planned
When I got my heart around it, it slipped right through my hands
Here with you I feel it
I close my eyes and see it
In a midnight talk, in a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms, that's where it is
When we're tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush, that's where it is
That's where it is
When I'm crashing through the madness
Not sure who I'm supposed to be
When I'm caught up in the darkness
It's your hand that's leading me
You bring me back to solid ground
You lift me up right here, right now
In a midnight talk, in a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms, that's where it is
When we're tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush, that's where it is
It's a lifetime thrill
When tiding braces
The biggest things in the smallest places
In a midnight talk, in a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms, that's where it is
When we're tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush, that's where it is
In the sweetest smile, on a night like this
And a tender touch, that's where it is
When we're tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush, that's where it is
That's where it isValerie (By Patti Scialfa)
Valerie
To the east and factories stand like fire breathing dragons against the sky.
And from their throats a scarlet river burns itself into smoky lullabies.
Over neon and fluorescent skies.
VALERIE CAN YOU HEAR THOSE ENGINES DRONE.
I WANTED TO GO TO MEXICO BUT I'M STRANDED HERE ALONE.
AND ONCE I KNEW A TRUE LOVE IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS SINCE HE'S GONE.
AND IF I COULD GET THAT FEELING BACK I'D GIVE UP EVERYTHING I OWN.
Sixteen days since I left corona and I traveled to this carnival town near Alberndeel.
And I rode the coaster there on the fairground. Twisted backbone of a beast that never heals. And I left some skin on fortunes wheel.
VALERIE CAN YOU HEAR THOSE ENGINES DRONE.
I WANTED TO GO TO MEXICO BUT I'M STRANDED HERE ALONE.
AND ONCE I KNEW A TRUE LOVE IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS SINCE HE'S GONE.
AND IF I COULD GET THAT FEELING BACK I'D GIVE UP EVERYTHING I OWN.
Everything's in slow motion now in this little border town.
I've come so close from so far.
Just to hide behind these windows here from the world outside.
I watch those cars and trucks raise trails of dust down the road as they pass by.
VALERIE CAN YOU HEAR THOSE ENGINES DRONE.
I WANTED TO GO TO MEXICO BUT I'M STRANDED HERE ALONE.
AND ONCE I KNEW A TRUE LOVE IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS SINCE HE'S GONE.
AND IF I COULD GET THAT FEELING BACK I'D GIVE UP EVERYTHING I OWN.I'm gonna be your full time daddy or I won't be no daddy at all

Both sides come together
And form a V
And that's what mama calls
The corner of the heart
She says a lot of couples
Never turn that corner
They don't love that deep
They care a little while
Then they drift apart
Well now, baby,
If you wonder why
I'm telling you all of this
It's because something is changing
I can feel it when we kiss
And if the moon keeps rising
You better hold on I am
Turning the corner of the heart
Back in the Albuquerque
Near the river
There was a cottonwood
One summer hooked up with
A climbing rose
And by the time it snowed
They were so tangled
Nothing on earth could get
That handsome couple to let go
Well now, baby,
This world spins too quick
For the eye to see
The slow changing
Of a stranger into family
But if the moon keeps rising
But if the moon keeps rising
Turning the corner of the heart
(Turning the corner of the heart)They never should have messed with New York City
They don't want none of old Uncle Sam
We stare right in the face of terror
And you know Lady Liberty still stands
With F15's and our Special Forces
God bless everyone we sent
To defend freedom and our nation
And thank goodness Bush is our President
Don't mess with America
Or we'll beat you red, white, and blue
Don't mess with America
That's the last thing that you want to do
You already had your chance
Now we're going to kick your
Don't mess with America
Bin Laden's going down like a White House intern
Kind of sounded like Ronnie Dunn, didn't I?
And while we're at it let's get that nut Hussein
When the threat of evil is finally silenced
You'll hear how loud freedom can ring
They started something we're gonna finish
(Those people who knocked these buildings down
(Will hear all of us soon)
And we won't rest until that day
(We will not tire, we will not falter, and we will not fail)
Everywhere you look you see them flags flying
(U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A., God bless America)
And what that stands for, they can't take that away
(My fellow Americans, let's roll)
Don't mess with America
Or we'll beat you red, white, and blue
Don't mess with America
Bin Laden, I'd hate to be you
You don't stand a chance
We're gonna open up a can of whoops
Don't mess with America
I said, don't with America
You're over there and preaching about a holy war
Don't with America
You're gonna be full of holes before one of them Navy Seals finds ya
Don't with America
And by the way get a beard trim
U.S.A.
U.S.A.
U.S.A.
...On a park bench on sunny afternoon
Sat a young boy and a girl bout seventeen
As we stood so closely by watched them hold each other's hand
On their faces love had written we're making plans
Then he said to her you're my guiding light
Then she said to him you make my whole world seem so bright
Then we saw their books of braille and that neither one could see
Then I thought how close they must be
Souch tenderness my eyes have never seen
Two young lovers both just in their teens
Though their world gives them no light they see much more than you and me
Don't you know how close they must be
Then a car stopped just a few steps away
And a voice said Jim and Jeannie it's time to go
With their hands still clutched so tight helping each other to the car
Can you imagine just how close they are
Don't you know how close they must beYou call me from a phone booth with tears in your voice
Tell me you've been out all night runnin' with the boys
You say you're cold and tired and lonely
And you got no place to go
There wasn't any phonebook
Mine's the only number that you know
Well call yourself a taxi and I'll pay 'I'm at the door
If you don't mind sleepin' on the sofa or on the floor
And I spend an hour hatin' you
'Til the cab pulls in
My heart has found another way
To be loving you again
And every time is the last time
And every time is the first
Everytime is the last time with you
Oh it never gets no better
And it couldn't get no wore
Then I hear the footsteps the driver's at the door
He says I look familiar has he made this run before
And I tell him I don't think so
What's it matter anyway
Just tell me what the meter reads
And I'll go and get your pay
Well now it's down to you and me though it don't seem right
We both know where we'll be and what we'll do tonight
And after an hour or two
When the night comes to an end
My heart has found another way
To be lovin' you again
And every time is the last time
And every time is the first
Everytime is the last time with you
Oh it never gets no better
And it couldn't get no worse
I know that there should be more to say I'll just reed your mind
Let's save what's left unsaid for another time
'Cause I know there'll be another time
So until then
My heart has found another way
To be lovin' you again
My heart has found another way
To be lovin' you again
Oh, my heart has found another way
To be lovin' you againLet it be Christmas everywhere
In the hearts of all people both near and a far
Christmas everywhere
Feel the love of the season wherever you are
On the small country roads lined with green mistletoe
Big city streets where a thousand lights glow
Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
Let it be Christmas
Christmas everywhere
Let it be Christmas everywhere
With the gold and silver, the green and the red
Christmas everywhere
In the smiles of all children asleep in their beds
In the eyes of young babies their first fallen snow
ElderlyÂ¹s memories that never grow old
Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
Let it be Christmas
Christmas everywhere
Let it be Christmas everywhere
In the songs that we sing and the gifts that we bring
Christmas everywhere
In what this day means and what we believe
From the sandy white beaches where blue water rolls
Snow covered mountains and valleys below
Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
Let it be Christmas
Christmas everywhere
Christmas everywhere
Christmas everywhereHow many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
Yes, and how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till we know
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
It's blowin' in the wind
Blowin', blowin' in the wind
How many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Pretending he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Blowin', blowin' in the wind
Blowin', it's blowin' in the wind
Blowin', it's blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the windI'm tired of cryin' and all your lyin' that's why I'm buyin' a China Doll
Her lips are truer her thoughts fewer her eyes are bluer my China Doll
I'd rather have a doll to play that I could call my own
Than someone just like you with a heart of stone
She'll never leave me she'll not deceive me and never leave me my China Doll
No tears or sorrow no sad tomorrow no one can borrow my China Doll
And her lips are truerCouldn't breathe this morning, I had a dream.
We were in a room papered with memories.
And though our pictures were plastered on the wall,
you didn't recognize me at all.
Wish there was a way to never sleep again
because I can't stop these dreams, they always let you in.
Chorus:
Maybe if I told you 'I need you', you'd still need me,
Maybe if I'd asked you to stay, you'd be here,
Maybe if I'd told you I'd loved you since we'd first met,
But you're a memory now,
And maybe I should just forget.
So you've ruined my morning, but that's all I'll allow,
I pull a smile on, and push you out for now,
Keeping busy, I keep you away,
But I lose the battle with the fading day.
Wish there was a way to never sleep again
because I can't stop these dreams, they always let you in.
Chorus:
Maybe if I told you 'I need you', you'd still need me,
Maybe if I'd asked you to stay, you'd be here,
Maybe if I'd told you I'd loved you since we'd first met,
But you're a memory now,
Insomnia, you're my insomnia, you're my insomnia, let me sleep.
Insomnia, you're my insomnia, you're my insomnia, let me be.
But I can't forget the things I meant to say,
when dreams get in the way.When the white azaleas start blooming
I'll come back to you
When spring's in the air with its freshness so rare
We'll make our dreams come true
When the white azaleas start blooming
Up in those mountains so high
We'll build a nest where we'll find happiness
Sweetheart for only you and I
(When the white azaleas start blooming
I'll come back to you)
When spring's in the air with its freshness so rare
We'll make our dreams come true
When the white azaleas start blooming...
(When the white azaleas start blooming)You've painted up your lips
And rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating
Going out somewhere
The shadow on the wall
Tells me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town
It wasn't me
That started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go
And do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true that
I'm not the man I used to be
Oh, Ruby I still need some company
Its hard to love a man
Whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age
Ruby I realize,
But it won't be long I've heard them say until I not around
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town
She's leaving now cause
I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it
Some hundred times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun
And put her in the ground
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to townYou gotta walk that lonesome valley you gotta go there by yourself
There's no one here can go there with you you gotta go there by yourself
Mother said while she was dying and her breath was almost gone
Keep your trust in the Holy Bible it will guide you safely home
You gotta walk
If you cannot sing like angels if you cannot preach like Paul
You can tell the love of Jesus you can tell he died for all
You gotta walkMy child arrived just the other day,
He came to the world in the usual way.
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay.
He learned to walk while I was away.
And he was talking 'fore I knew it, and as he grew,
He'd say, "I'm gonna be like you, dad.
You know I'm gonna be like you."
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
"When you coming home, dad?" "I don't know when,
But we'll get together then.
You know we'll have a good time then."
My son turned ten just the other day.
He said, "Thanks for the ball, dad, come on let's play.
Can you teach me to throw?" I said, "Not today,
I got a lot to do." He said, "That's ok."
And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed,
Said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah.
You know I'm gonna be like him."
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
"When you coming home, dad?" "I don't know when,
But we'll get together then.
You know we'll have a good time then."
Well, he came from college just the other day,
So much like a man I just had to say,
"Son, I'm proud of you. Can you sit for a while?"
He shook his head, and he said with a smile,
"What I'd really like, dad, is to borrow the car keys.
See you later. Can I have them please?"
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
"When you coming home, son?" "I don't know when,
But we'll get together then, dad.
You know we'll have a good time then."
I've long since retired and my son's moved away.
I called him up just the other day.
I said, "I'd like to see you if you don't mind."
He said, "I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time.
You see, my new job's a hassle, and the kid's got the flu,
But it's sure nice talking to you, dad.
It's been sure nice talking to you."
And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me,
He'd grown up just like me.
My boy was just like me.
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
"When you coming home, son?" "I don't know when,
But we'll get together then, dad.
We're gonna have a good time then.Well, I parked my car in the driveway
Somewhere around 1 am
Worn out from the road with a big heavy load
On my mind, what a week it had been
Then I stumbled into the kitchen
And I saw that little red light
Blinkin' at me from my message machine
Then I knew it would be alright
'Cause she said
"Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely"
Now it didn't take me a second 'til I knew
The right thing to do
I picked up the phone and said "Baby I'm home
I'll be there in a minute or two."
I stole some of my neighbor's daisies
Grabbed an old bottle of wine
She don't call me much but I know when she does
That I'm in for one helluva time
When she says,
"Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely"
Baby, baby, baby just for tonight
Be my one and only
Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Yeah everybody needs a little love sometimes
Yeah, who am I to leave you hangin' high and dry
No baby, not tonight
No,no,no,no
Not tonight, now baby
"Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely"
Baby, baby just come hold me tight
You don't have to call me
Baby, baby, baby come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
I'm lonely, lonely, lonely
So come on baby
Said, "I'll be there in a minute or two."
And I brought those daises and that red wine
We had one hell of a time
Yeah, yeah, yeahI wandered so aimless, life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord, I saw the light.
Just like a blind man I wandered a long,
Worries and fears I claimed for my own.
Then like the blind man that God gave back my sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
I was a fool to wander and stray,
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
I saw the light, I saw the light
No more in darkness no more in night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the lightAll the way to Jericho in a rusted automobile
if you could only find out anyway you oughta feel
all the way to Jericho in a rusted auto
lookin at the yellow moon-waitin for the northern star
All the way to Jericho it doesn't even seem that real
knowin' that the time is gone-nuthin' left to save or steal
All the way to Jericho all the while singin' low
wishin for a passenger-waiting for that northern star
All the way to Jericho in a rusted automobile
mighta missed a sign you saw farm road-corn field
say goodbye to Jericho, lookin at the book of dreams
how to get to Bethlehem-time to get some gasoline
And when you see that starry night
or a cross up on a hill
then you wait for early light
to take yer hands off the wheel
when you see that starry nightWally Walker spent his last twenty dollars
On lottery tickets at the corner store
He came in without any milk and bread
Well his wife Heather was madder than ever
Said I can't believe you did that you know we're poor
Them tickets just dig us a little deeper
In the whole
He said, you never known
Old Sawmill Kenny kissed his Jenny
Said I'll see you tonight around supper time
He pulled that old Dodge truck out on the road
Well he went around a curve and Kenny had to swerve
To miss a little girl riding a bike
He gave his life to save her
As his maker said it's time to go
You never know what's around the bend
Could be a new beginning
Or it could be the end
You can dream, plan, scream, wish, pray and hope
But you never know
That Pentecost preacher was a part time teacher
At the Mississippi Missionary Bible School
Oh silver tongue Sara was a holy terror
She took him somewhere he didn't want to go
Said he was a sinner and later that winter it showed
You never know what's around the bend
Could be a new beginning
Or it could be the end
You can dream, plan, scream, wish, pray and hope
But you never know
You never know what's around the bend
Could be a new beginning
Or it could be the end
You can dream, plan, scream, wish, pray and hope
But you never know
That preacher didn't know (you never know)
Kenny didn't know that when he left the house that morning
He wouldn't be home that night
Oh yeah, and Wally Walker
He didn't know he was gonna win
Sixty million dollars last Saturday (you never know)A drunk man walking down a rainy street
A wood floor and new socks on your bare feet
You look down and suddenly you're looking up
Whoops, I slipped and fell in love
A bald tire running on an icy road
A steep hill underneath a foot of snow
A greased pig fallen off a pickup truck
Whoops, I slipped and fell in love
I hope that you're feeling the way that I feel
It's just like flying but you're standing still
The birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
Whoops, I slipped and fell in love
An ice cube hiding on your kitchen floor
A bad step leading up to your back door
How'd I wind up on my butt
Whoops, I slipped and feel in love
I hope that you're feeling the way that I feel
It's just like flying but you're standing still
The birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
Whoops, I slipped and fell in love
I hope that you're feeling the way that I feel
It's just like flying but you're standing still
The birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
Whoops, I slipped and fell in love
Help, I've fallen I can't getup
Whoops, I slipped and fell in loveWhen I saw you buyin' Cosmo and a Hot Rod magazine
I said to myself now there's a girl for me
And when I asked you to go for a ride
You stole my heart when you said if I can drive
I said how bout some music you said you got any Merle
That's when I knew you were my kind of girl
And when we started talking I could not believe my ears
You said you were a Braves fan even through the rotten years
You quoted William Faulkner and Martin Luther King
You said your favorite movie star would always be James Dean
And when we went to dinner you wore blue jeans with your pearls
That's when I knew you were my kind of girl
You march to the beat of a different drum
The funny thing is that I hear the same one
We both like to color outside of the lines
We're peas in a pod girl we're two of a kind
Yeah you march to the beat of a different drum
I said I think I love you you said what's not to love
I thought about a kiss but I wasn't quick enough
I guess while I was thinkin' you were readin' my mind
Cause you wrapped your arms around me and you pressed your lips to mineIf your paycheck depends on
The weather and the clock
If your conversation calls for
A little more than a coffee pot
If you need to pour your heart out
And try to rectify some situation
That you're facing

Hahah, just fun lovin people like us
Hillbilly people like us!Sometimes when I am lonely I get to thinking bout the places that I've been
I turn around in the same old direction once again I'm going home on a midnight train
When I left you was the middle of the winter
The ground was covered by a cold cold snow
My heart was young and I was searching but in vain I'm going home on a midnight train
Home is not just a place where you are living
Home means more when you've got no place to go
And when you're down and need someone to stand beside you
Turn around and go on home
When you're down and need someone...I throwed and I throwed that old rope
At that make-believe steer
I'd never been so frustrated
In all my nine years
I was about to give up on that old bail of hay
When from the front porch I heard my Dad say
[Chorus:]
My little cowboy
You make me so proud, boy
Don't give up now
Cause I know that somehow
You'll figure it out
My little cowboy
I played and I played this old bar
Trying to make the big time
I stayed broke which was cool
Until along came a kid and a wife
That's when I called up my Dad, I said today is the day
It's time to put this old guitar away... and he said
[Chorus:]
Hold on there, cowboy
You make me so proud, boy
Don't give up now
'Cause I know that somehow
Youll figure it out
Yeah, my little cowboy, yeah
Now I've got a boy of my own
With his own set of dreams
He works hard to play quarterback
For his pee-wee league team
A blue star on his helmet, our last name on his back
Three downs in a row, all end with a sack... and I hollered out
[Chorus:]
That's my little cowboy
You make me so proud, boy
Don't give up now
'Cause I know that somehow
You'll throw that touchdown
Oh, my little cowboy
My little cowboyGO TO HELL

The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain
So I'll cherish the Old Rugged Cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
And I will cling to the Old Rugged Cross
And exchange it some day for a crown
To the Old Rugged Cross, I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach, gladly bear
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away
Where His glory forever I'll share
And I'll cherish the Old Rugged Cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
And I will cling to the Old Rugged Cross
And exchange it some day for a crownSouthern lights and how planes fly
Some things I'll never understand
Like me here again tonight
At your memories command
Next thing I'm fighting for this heart of mine
I just can't forget the night I lost you
It's still a mystery after all this time
Though I've tried, I just don't get it
You've still got it
Turn the page, close the book
Put it on a shelf and let it be
That promise made was all it took
For you to make a lier out of me
Next thing I'm fighting for this heart of mine
I just can't forget the night I lost you
It's still a mystery after all this time
Though I've tried, I just don't get it
You've still got itHey Little Girl
Hey little girl, you don't have to hide nothin' no more,
Oh, you didn't do nothin' that hasn't been done before.
Little girl thought she wouldn't get caught, you see,
She thought she's get away with goin' out on me.
Oh, other girls do it, you didn't think of nothin' new,
You went out on me, so what, other girls do too.
You can leave little girl, 'cause I don't want you around no more,
And if you come knockin' you won't get past my door.
Oh, you got nothin' to hide and everybody knows it's true,
Too bad little girl 'cause it's all over for you.So your bags are all packed and you're leaving
Without so much as telling me why
Pardon me if I skip all the grieving
I'll simply get on with my life
'Cause I know there'll come a day
It'll come back on you and you'll pay
But won't be me you'll answer to
When the judgment arrives
And your penance is due
Forgiveness may come
For the things that you've done
For your dishonesty
But it won't be me
Well, it goes against my christian raising
To be feeling the way that I am
I should get on my knees
And start praying for your absolution
But I've tried and I can't
After what you did to me and to us
You've betrayed all my love and my trust
It won't be me you'll answer to
When the judgment arrives
And your penance is due
Forgiveness may come
For the things that you've done
For your dishonesty
But it won't be me
Now this isn't a threat or a curse
Just remember you heard it here first
It won't be me you'll answer to
When the judgment arrives
And your penance is due
Forgiveness may come
For the things that you've done
For your dishonesty
But it won't be me
No, it won't be meI gas up my truck and I drive into town
But I spend all my time just ridin' around
Tryin' to shake this negative mood I'm in
I know where to go if I want to get down
All the usual suspects are hangin' around
But after a round or two, it's just another dead end
For a minute or two, I'll get you off my mind
But you keep comin' back to me every time
Where do I go to get over the fact
That you got on a plane and you ain't comin' back
I said what I said and you did what you had to do
Where does a man have to go to get over the truth
Where do I go from you
I bury myself in my job all day
Just tryin' to get lost in the usual ways
Smilin' and laughin' and jokin' around with the guys
Gotta do something to deaden the pain
So I stare at the window just watchin' the rain
But all I can see in the haze is the grey of your eyes
So what do I do with all the pieces of you in me
If you're never comin' back, set me free
Where do I go to get over the fact
That you got on plane, and you ain't comin' back
I said what I said, and you did what you had to do
Where does a man have to go to get over the truth
Where do I go from you
Where do I go from you
Where do I go to get over the fact
That you got on a plane, and you ain't comin' back
I said what I said, and you did what you had to do
Where does a man have to go to get over the truth
Where do I go from you
Where do I go from youRain on the room and time on my hands
It sure seemed quiet out there in radio land
They call me at the all-night station
Make their special dedications
And I do my best to play their request
When it's a desperate situation
This was a desperate situation
I'm Mr. Midnight alone and blue
The brokenhearted call me up
When they don't know what else to do
Every song is a reminder of the love that they once knew
I'm Mr. Midnight, can I play a song for you
"Caller on the line could you please hold on?"
I recognized her voice the minute i picked up the phone
Should I tell her that it's me or leave it at a memory
Haven't been myself since the day she left
And I'm never gonna be
I'm forever gonna be
I'm Mr. Midnight alone and blue
The brokenhearted call me up
When they don't know what else to do
Every song is a reminder of the love that they once knew
I'm Mr. Midnight, can I play a song for you
Imagine my surprise when she spoke my name
She said, "Could you tell him that I love him
and I wish things could be the same."
Then a voice I never knew
Said, "Honey who you talking to?"
I'm Mr. Midnight alone and blue
The brokenhearted call me up
When they don't know what else to do
Every song is a reminder of the love that they once knew
I'm Mr. Midnight, can I play a song for youTurn on a neon light
At least make it feel like night
Put on some this or that
And maybe I won't feel so bad
Need a little background noise
To drown out this little voice
Running circles 'round my brain
Screaming louder than the pain
My head is spinning
My resolve is reeling
I can tell by the heavy in my heart
I'm going down soon
No use fighting the fight
It's no contest tonight
My figured out's never been more confused
Having mixed drinks about feelings and you
Turn off the bedroom light
Put on a brave face and face the night
It's either get used to this dread
Or the cold spot in our bed
The bottle helps, but the memory burns
The whiskey soothes, but I toss and turn
I'll find sleep 'til dreams relent
Wake up tired and try again
My head is spinning
My resolve is reeling
I can tell by the heavy in my heart
I'm going down soon
No use fighting the fight
It's no contest tonight
My figured out's never been more confused
Having mixed drinks about feelings and you
Having mixed drinks about feelings and youGeorgie Buck is dead
The last thing he said
"Don't put no shortnin' in my bread."
Georgie Buck is dead
The last thing he said
"Don't put no shortnin' in my bread."
Down the road
Down the road I see
Trouble in my way
Trouble in my way
Trouble in my way down the line.
Georgie Buck is dead
Last word he said
"Don't let a woman have her way.
"If she have her way,
She be gone all day.
Don't let a woman have her way."
Whoah!
Down the line

Down the line I see
Trouble in my way
Trouble in my way
Trouble in my way down the line.

The last word he said
"Don't put no shortnin' in my bread."
Put no shortnin in my bread...
Put no shortnin' in my bread...
Down the line

Trouble come my way
Trouble come my way
Trouble in my way down the line.I never fly, they say you don't know what you're missing
Your dreams just come alive, but I forget to try
So I, I never fly
Warm in my bed, the places I imagine
Could live only in your head
So sweet that I could cry
But I never fly
When I was just a little boy before I'd fall asleep
My mind would wander way beyond the stars
A neverending universe too big for thoughts to keep
Surrounds me like an Angel in the sky
I love to dream, flowing just like heaven
On a gently flowing stream
I'll watch the world go by but I, I never flyI'm Gonna shine up my boots,
I'm gonna go into town,
I'm gonna scrape up 20 dollars,
I'm gonna throw it around
I'm gonna buy me a dance,
first lovely lady that I see,
And when the dance is through
I'll say, "will you marry me"
I'm gonna shine up my boots,
I'm gonna go into town,
I'm gonna scrape up 20 dollars,
I'm gonna throw it around
I'm gonna find me a game,
Of hold 'em if I can,
and fold 'em all night long,
til I got me a hand
I'm gonna buy us a ranch,
With a Palomino Herd
And I won't mean no harm,
babe and I won't say a word.
When misery comes to call,
A gift to him, my life
I'll sit with him awhile,
and share my horse, my hole, my wife
I'm gonna shine up my boots,
I'm gonna go into town,
I'm gonna scrape up 20 dollars,
I'm gonna throw it around.
I'm gonna buy me a dance,
first lovely lady that i see,
and when the dance is through,
I'll say "will you marry me"We were waltzing that night in Kentucky
Beneath the beautiful harvest moon
And I was the boy that was lucky
But it all ended too soon
As I sit here alone in the moonlight
I see your smiling face
And I long once more for your embrace
In that beautiful Kentucky waltz
We were waltzing that night in Kentucky
Beneath the beautiful harvest moon
And I was the boy that was lucky
But it all ended too soon
As I sit here alone in the moonlight
I see your smiling face
And I long once more for your embrace
In that beautiful Kentucky waltzFriday night alone
And calling everyone you know
You're reaching for the cigarattes
You gave up long ago
You wanna go and get drunk somewhere
Turn it off and just not care
For a little while
You're runnin' over what went wrong
For a hundredth time today
You wonder if another thought
Will ever take its place
You're feeling like you're
Trapped inside
Your own bad dream
One that's never gonna end
But here's the funny thing
My friend
You feel like you're gonna die
But you don't
You think that the world
Will stop
But it won't
And it's the darnest thing I know
The sun comes up
It's another day
And your heart still beats
And you see
Hey
I'm still breathing
Take it from me
These little victories
Are all a heart needs
Photographs you tore and have
it scattered on the floor
Letters where he swore
His love mean nothing anymore
You can't imagine how to get from here to there
But one day you'll know where to start
That's the power of the heart
You feel like you're gonna die
But you don't
You think that the world would stop
But it won't
And it's the darnest thing I know
The sun comes up
It's another day
And your heart still beats
And you see
Hey
I'm still breathing
Take it from me
These little victories
Are all a heart needs
The dog still barks
And your shower's hot
And you burned your hand on the coffee pot
So like it or not
Gotta say
I'm still breathing
Take it from me
These little victories
Are all a heart needs!You may have to drag me away from my demons
Kicking and screaming
It's been so long now, I've been with them
Don't know where they stop and I begin
We draw a line in the sand
Will you cross it? Oh, will you die for this?
Got nothing to tell you that you don't
Through your sadness below, already know
[Repeat x2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Live through the past again
How many times must I live through the past again?
No more
Truth beyond truth and by our design
It is very fine, like Newman's wine
Oh, to be like him and walk a path
To lend a hand, do something worth a damn
[Repeat x2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Live through the past again
How many times must I live through the past again?
No more, wait
You may have to drag me away from my demons
Kicking and screaming
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Live through the past again
How many times must I live through the past again?
How many times must I live through the past again?
How many times must I live through the past again?
No more, waitI cut my teeth on a poker chip my daddy left layin' behind
The said he was a dealin' from the bottom but my mama said they were lyin'
So I never stay in one place long I'm just a natural born rambler
My mama was a Dodge City dance hall girl and my daddy was a riverboat gambler
So don't kiss my cheek and look at me with stayin' in your eyes
For marriage is like shootin' against a pair of loaded dice
You better throw your hand in for you just cant hold this rambler
My mama was a Dodge City dance hall girl and my daddy was a riverboat gambler
I'll say you're the closest thing to love I've ever known
But without the feel of the paddle wheel I'd never be at home
Well I must go for I just heard the river call this rambler
My mama was a Dodge City dance hall girl and my daddy was a riverboat gambler
So don't kiss my cheek...
My mama was a Dodge City dance hall girl and my daddy was a riverboat gamblerI've been a feelin' kinda funny oh and everyday is sunny
All the bees are makin' honey oh the lovin' season is on
Got all the ambition got a sweet deposition
Baby I've been wishin' you will gonna catch me before the lovin' season is gone
Well I've got nothing but time to try to win your love
Oh baby you're on my mind and you're the only thing I've been thinking of
Well I'm taking my stand I try as hard as I can
And prove that I'm the right man when lovin' season is near
Well baby you're so pleasin' all I need is squeezin'
Maybe that's the reason I'm a runnin' slow because the lovin' season is here
Well I've got nothing but time to try to win your love
Oh baby you're on my mind and you're the only thing I've been thinking of
Well I'm gonna bet'cha oh I'm gonna get'cha
Baby I'll just let'cha lovin' season is here lovin' season is hereI long to be his possession he is my everything
I remember my days of darkness without sunshine or sight to lead my way
Then a whisper of his voice softly called me to the arms of my maker to stay
He is my reason for living he is the king of all kings
I long to be his possession he is my everything
After the lightning and the thunder after the last bell has rung
I want to bow down before Jesus and hear him say well done
He is my reason for living...
I long to be his possession he is my everythingI wish I could come back to you dear cause I know that you want me to
But too much water has run under that old bridge
There's too many rivers between me and you
There's too many rivers to cross dear too many dreams have been lost
And there's too many long nights that I've turned and tossed
There's too many rivers to cross
Now don't think for a moment that I blame only you
We both killed the fruit on the vine
And when you try to put love back together
There's always a few little pieces that you can't find
Well there's too many rivers to cross dear.[Verse one]
I'm looking for Christmas, I've gotta find
Christmas, flying back in my mind
Does anyone know of this Christmas, a long ago christmas
Sleigh bells ringing, carolers singing
Only bringing the long traveled message of love
[Verse two]
I'm looking for Christmas, in time for this
Christmas, a day far and away
And could a star show me Christmas,
The town of old Christmas
Where truth is ringing, a virgin's
Bringing the newborn king and the
Lord's own messiah of love
[Chorus one]
And I close my eyes and I'm kneeling there in the stall,
And could I be the wine man, sharing his wisdom,
Creating a kingdom for all
Verse three
I'm looking for Christmas, I know I'll find Christmas
Imparted right from the start
And everyone knows of this Christmas
The very first Christmas
Where Christ is guiding, all with tidings
Still his light is residing here in us all
[Chorus two]
And I close my eyes, and a thousand lifetimes recall
Aren't we all wise magi, sharing his wisdom,
Creating a kingdom
As born on this Christmas and each Christmas day
We are sharing his wisdom creating a kingdom
As born on this Christmas and each
Christmas day that shall fallPair of boots and a sack of clothes
Free and easy down the road I go
Hanging memories on the high line poles
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go
Ragweed's rocking on the radio
Free and easy down the road I go
So I keep rolling like an old banjo
Free and easy down the road I go
Got the sun shining on me like a big spotlight
So I know everything is gonna be alright
Ain't no telling where the wind might blow
Free and easy down the road I go
Living life like a Sunday stroll
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go
If you only get to go around one time
I'm gonna sit back and try to enjoy the ride
I could make a million or wind up broke
Free and easy down the road I go
Can't take it with you when you go so
Free and easy down the road I go
Someday I know it's gonna take me home so
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I goI've seen people everywhere who said they didn't care
If life for them would come to an end and they just sit and stare
I've thought it was a shame I said they were insane
I couldn't see why they wanted to die but I didn't know the pain
I wonder what I'd say if my life turn out that way
I never knew but now I do I lost my love today
I lost my love today I lost my love today
I can't go on my heart is gone I lost my love todayIn the weeks that follow a breakup
The last thing you want to do
Is be out buyin' groceries
And see you-know-who
I left a half-filled shopping cart
Sittin' on isle three
Made a beeline for my car
Prayin' that she didn't see me and
It ended well
We said we'd still be friends
So somebody tell me why
It's so hard to say hello
To the one who said goodbye
Months pass and you move on
You hardly think about it
I don't remember where I was
I just remember it was crowded
I ducked behind a friend of mine
The minute she walked in
And it'd be one thing if we
Swore we'd never talk again but
It ended well
We said we'd still be friends
So somebody tell me why
It's so hard to say hello
To the one who said goodbye
You spend years with a person
You know all their secrets
You've said, "I love you", a million times
I used to light up the moment I'd see her
Now I look for a place to hide
Now I've found the woman
That I'm meant to be with
The moment I saw her I just knew
So isn't it crazy I still get flustered
Whenever I run into you-know-who
It's so hard to say hello
Can somebody tell me why
It's so hard to say hello
To the one that said goodbyeAnother note afloat upon this paper sea
Explain to me
How this can be
Another face erased
From this tidal pool
Found one day
Then swept away
I will carry you my love
If you can carry me
Through this summer of our discontent
Another day away
From clutching hands
Explain to me
How this can be
I will carry you my love
If you can carry me
Through this summer of our discontent
Another falling wave
Upon this crumbling beach
How many more
Until we meet?
I will carry you my love
If you can carry me
Through this summer of our discontentToday I passed you on the street and my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else walked by your side and he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
[ piano - guitar ]
It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you and hold you the way I used to do
Heaven only knows how much I miss you I can't help it if I'm still in love with you(Dolly Parton)
If there ever was an angel, then surely you must be one
If there ever was a perfect love when I look at you I see one
If there's heaven on earth, then this must surely be
And I want you to be the last one to touch me
The last thing I remember before I go to sleep
Is the touch of your sweet lips softly kissing me
And I go to sleep athinking how happy you make me
And I want you to be the last one to touch me
And when it's time to lay me down for my eternal sleep
Once more let your fingers softly touch my cheek
If I know that you have touched me, then I can sleep in peace
And I want you to be the last one to touch me
And when the night is over and time will be no more
They say that we shall meet again upon the golden shore
And so when I awaken from my eternal sleep
I want you to be the first one to touch me
I want you to be the first, the last, the only one to touch meAnother note afloat upon this paper sea
Explain to me
How this can be
Another face erased
From this tidal pool
Found one day
Then swept away
I will carry you my love
If you can carry me
Through this summer of our discontent
Another day away
From clutching hands
Explain to me
How this can be
I will carry you my love
If you can carry me
Through this summer of our discontent
Another falling wave
Upon this crumbling beach
How many more
Until we meet?
I will carry you my love
If you can carry me
Through this summer of our discontentAs I look at the letters
That you wrote to me,
It's you that I'm thinking of,
As I read the lines
That to me were so sweet,
I remember our faded love.
I miss you, darling,
More and more, every day,
As heaven would miss the stars above,
With every heartbeat
I still think of you,
And remember our faded love.
I think of the past
And all the pleasures we had
As I watch the mating of the doves
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye
I remember our faded love
I miss you, darling
More and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat
I still think of you
And remember our faded loveEvery day I read ads in the paper
Saying come to the islands
Bikini'd ladies sweet rum drinks, yeah
They'll keep you smiling
But I've got calypso music on the record at home
And when it comes to the warmth and sunshine
Well, I got my own
You're my Jamaica
You're where I want to be
You're my island when I am being
Tossed on a stormy sea
My heavenly haven
Where I can spend eternity
You're my Jamaica
Your paradise to me
White sunny sand palm trees and tans
It's sounds so inviting
(Sounds so inviting)
Limbo dancing and star light romancing
It's all so exciting
But I got my flowery shirt
And rum punch in my hand
And my own exotic lover in my native land
You're my Jamaica
You're where I want to be
You're my island when I am being
Tossed on a stormy sea
My heavenly haven
Where I can spend eternity
You're my Jamaica
You're paradise to meAfter you have finished all your runnin' round and you find a card against your stack
After you are weary and so sick inside I'll always be glad to take you back
People tell me that you have straight dear that you're traveling on that other track
But after all they just don't really know you I'll always be glad to take you back
[ guitar - dobro ]
After life has taught you dear who really cares after all the rest is through with you
Just give me a ring and you will find me here waiting as I've always done for you
People tell me...Today I passed you on the street and my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
[ guitar - steel ]
It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you and hold you just the way I used to do
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you I can't help it if I'm still in love with youOur room was filled with silence
I guess we'd said it all
I don't know when I'd seen our bedroom
So long I can't recall
We'd built this thing between us
I'm not sure what's the cause
So I swallowed all my pride
And tonight I climbed the wall
Tonight I climbed the wall
And took her by the hand
We'd come too far to fall
Couldn't stand to see it end
So tonight I climbed the wall
Makin' love is so much sweeter
When you love the one you hold
After all these years of holdin' her
You'd think by now I'd know
Now as we lie here together
All our troubles seem so small
Just these satin sheets between us
Cause tonight I climbed the wall
Tonight I climbed the wall
And took her by the hand
We'd come too far to fall
Couldn't stand to see it end
So tonight I climbed the wall
Tonight I climbed the wall
Tonight I climbed the wallI went home for Christmas
To the house that I grew up in
Going back was something after all these years
I drove down Monterey Street
And felt a little sadness
When I turned left on Laurel and the house appeared
And I snuck up to that rocking chair
Where the winter sunlight slanted on the screened-in porch
And I stared out past the shade tree
That my laughing daddy planted on the day that I was born
And I let time go by so slow
And I made every moment last
And I thought about years
How they take so long
And they go so fast
Across the street the Randol's oldest daughter must have come home
Her two boys built a snowman by the backyard swings
I thought of old man Randol and his Christmas decorations
And how he used to leave them up till early spring
And I though of all the summers
That I paced that porch and swore I'd die of boredom there
And I thought of what I'd give to feel another summer linger
Where a day feels like a year
And I let time go by so slow
And I made every moment last
And I thought about years
How they take so long
And they go so fast
Then the door flew open, and my mother's voice was laughing
As she called back to my daddy, "Come look who's here"
And I thought about years
And I let time go by so slow
And I made every moment last
And I thought about years
How they take so long
And they go so fastThe Daylight Line written by Gene Clark There were too many people ridin' on the daylight line
I delivered to the club proceeded on a bottle of wine
Watching all the coastline roll, like anywhere it really could go
I never thought I'd strike a rhythm that would leave you cold
I'd be home in the city but really that is not my pace
I could go down in pity or leave and take a look at my face
Watching all the coastline roll, like anywhere it really could go
I never thought I'd strike a rhythm that would leave you cold
Sleepless nights without you
I don't want to live without you
But baby you know, oh whoa
We've got something between us
We better take it high or let it go, oh whoa I have sleepless nights without you
I don't want to live without you
But baby you know, oh whoa
We got something between us We better take it high or let it go, oh whoa
So there's too many people crowded on the daylight line
I delivered to the club proceeded on a bottle of wine
Watching all the coastline roll, like anywhere it really could go
I never thought I'd strike a rhythm that would leave you cold
Watching all the coastline roll, like anywhere it really could go
I never thought I'd strike a rhythm that would leave you coldShe says not to buy her flowers
Or big expensive gifts
She says she don't want jewelry
And she doesn't need another dress
If I want to show her how much I adore her
The best way that I've found
Is to make sure when I'm finished
I put that toilet seat down
We've been to counciling
To try and see the ways we could improve
This thing between us
And different ways to show each other "I love you"
Forget about those getaway vacations
To romantic coastal towns
If you want to say "I love you"
Then put that toilet seat down
'Cause in the middle of the night
It's cold and it's dark
And when I hear my name in vain
I know I haven't done my part
She just wants me to support her
And the best way that I've found
So with a gentle hand and a loving touch
I put that toilet seat down
I know it's kind of funny
You can teach a little puppy
But it's very hard to train a grown man
When I'm all about my business
And the path of least resistance
She's the one that suffers in the endTraveling with the rodeo
It's the only life I'll ever know
I started in New Mexico
Must have been a thousand years ago
I used to be the best they say
At riding young wild horses for my pay
But now I'm much too old it seems
I only rides wild horses in his dreams
They use to tell me, ride 'em cowboy don't let 'em throw you down
You can't make no money if you hit the ground
They say, ride 'em cowboy don't let 'em throw you down
You're the toughest cowboy in town
I have always been a traveling cowboy
But now there's no place left to go
What in I supposed to do
Seems I'm left out in the cold
Ride 'em cowboy don't let 'em throw you down
You can't make no money if you hit the ground
They say, ride 'em cowboy don't let 'em throw you down
You're the toughest cowboy in town
Oh midnight was the champion
He is the only bronc I couldn't ride
But now I hear old Midnights blind
And rides little children for a dime
Ladies used to hang around
I must have been a hero in their eyes
My silver spurs are rusted now
Lord, I wished I tried to settle down
They use to tell me, ride 'em cowboy don't let 'em throw you down
You can't make no money if you hit the ground
They say, ride 'em cowboy don't let 'em throw you down
You're the toughest cowboy in town
Traveling with the rodeo
It's the only life I'll ever knowIt's a sin, my darling how I love you
Because I know our love can never be
It's a sin to keep this memory of you
When silence proves that you've forgotten me
The dream I built for us has tumbled
Each promise broken like my heart
It's a sin, my darling how I love you
So much in love and yet so far apart
It's a sin to hide behind this heartache
To make believe that I've found someone new
It's a sin to say that I don't miss you
When people know I'm still in love with you
I'm sure you're happy with another
Who shares the love I couldn't win
Why pretend that I can't live without you
When deep inside I know that it's a sinMAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT IT ALL
Writers Bill Anderson, Steve Wariner
RECORDED BY DIAMOND RIO AND BY GENE WATSON
I'm watching you go from room to room
With all your boxes and your broom
Packing up, sweeping out and taking down
From off the wall
Everything that's part of us
Tear my whole world down if you must
Don't even leave one little speck of dust
Make sure you've got it all
Chorus
Take my heart, take my soul
Take it all with you when you go
Just leave the floor here to catch me when I fall
You stole my pride and dignity
You took it all away from me
Take one last look around, girl, before you leave
Make sure you've got it all
Don't even leave one photograph
The memory of one smile or laugh
Check the closet up in the attic and down the hall
Take your time, take your rings
Take the sandbox and the swings
Without a family they're just things
Make sure you've got it all
Repeat chorus
Tag
Take one last look around, girl, before you leave
Make sure you've got it allSometimes I wake up with the sadness
Other days it feels like madness
Ohwhat would I do without you?
When colours turn to shades of grey
With the weight of the world at the end of the day
Ohwhat would I do without you?
A decade goes by without a warning
And theres still the kindness in your eyes
And its the questions and the worries
A piece of mind, always takes me by surprise.
I feel like Im walking with eyes as blind
As a man without a Lenard in a cold mind
Ohwhat would I do without you?
My imagination gets the best of me
And Im trying to hide lost at sea
Ohwhat would I do without you?
The difference between whatve said and done
And youre still standing by my side
A guilty soul and a worried mind
I will never make you, if Im on my own
See youve got the morning, Ive got midnight
You are patience Im always on time
Ohwhat would I do without you?
Youve got your sunshine, Ive got rainclouds
Youve got hope, Ive got my doubts
Ohwhat would I do without you?
Ohwhat would I do without you?
Ohwhat would I do without you?I knew when she blew in she wouldn't stay
Every now and then God makes one that way
A red head, wild child with storms in her eyes
I knew I'd never be the same
That's the thing about a hurricane
She's all lightning and wind and rain
Get too close and you're swept away
Better hold on till it breaks
'Cause it's a hell of a ride if you can just survive the pain
But that's the thing about a hurricane
She said she was running from her past
And every breath she stole felt like my last
Her kiss told me better get out of here
But I was too far gone to care
That's the thing about a hurricane
She's all lightning and wind and rain
Get too close and you're swept away
Better hold on till it breaks
'Cause it's a hell of a ride if you can just survive the pain
But that's the thing about a hurricane
Even in blue skies there ain't no forgettin'
Is it any wonder they name 'em after women
That's the thing about a hurricane
She's all lightning and wind and rain
Get too close and you're swept away
Better hold on till it breaks
'Cause it's a hell of a ride if you can just survive the pain
But that's the thing about a hurricaneLeaning on the old top rail in a big corral
Looking down the twilight trail for my long lost pal
How he sang when he sprang on his old mustang and rode away
Down the track by my shack he said I'll be back another day
Oh the moon is shining pale on a lonesome gal
Leaning on the old top rail in a big corral
Leaning on the old top rail...[ Both ]
Mhm too used to that certain someone to offer my love to anyone new
My excuse for not wanting no one too used to being with you
[ Skeeter ]
When you lose a true love you treasure other affairs are just to pass time
You find a kiss just a cheap imitation the love they offer's not real genuine
[ Both ]
Too used to that certain someone...
[ Bobby ]
Some other's arms may hold and caress you and some other's lips may burn on my own
While my eyes are filled with their beauty my heart inside will be crying alone
[ Both ]
Too used to that certain someone...She only wants me on the weekend
Why do I want it all the time?
I even see you when I'm sleeping
The only thing that's on my mind
I've been spending my money and spending on mind
I been cool with your friends I remembered your sign
But she only wants me on the weekend
And why do I want it
Why do I want it all the time?
Why do I want it all the time?
If I said I didn't, I'd be lying
You know I want it all the, you know I want it all the time
When you're shaking that, shake it all over baby
You got a mean, bad body, got to celebrate it
I give my love and she just takes it
No, she don't even need to ask
Don't give it back, she don't replace it
Looking at that, I can't be mad
I've been spending my money and spending on mind
I been cool with your friends I remembered your sign
But she only wants me on the weekend
And why do I want it
Why do I want it all the time?
Why do I want it all the time?
If I said I didn't, I'd be lying
You know I want it all the, you know I want it all the time
Shaking that, shake it all over baby
Oh oh got a mean, bad body, got to celebrate it
Oh oh don't know what I love, but you're gonna make it
Oh oh you know I want it all the time
Oh oh oh
She only wants me on the weekend
I give what she wants all the time
She always leave me when I'm sleeping
Why do I want it
Why do I want it all the time?
Why do I want it all the time?
If I said I didn't, I'd be lying
She knows I want it all the, she knows I want it all the time
(She knows, she knows, she knows) shaking that, shake it all over baby
(She knows, she knows, she knows) got a mean, bad body, got to celebrate it
(She knows, she knows, she knows) don't know what I love, but you're gonna make it
(She knows, she knows, she knows) you know I want it all the timeSure feels like love, the best I remember
Sure feels like love, the best I recall
It's so good, it feels like the first time I reached out
And really went for it all
Sure feels like love, 'cause I don't remember
The last time that love felt this strong
So you're either gonna have to stop what you're doin' to me right now
Or you're gonna have to keep doin' it all night long
You're drivin' me crazy and you may even try
I know you're a lady, there's no way of denyin'
I don't remember the last time love felt this strong
So you're either gonna have to stop what you're doin' to me right now
Or you're gonna have to keep doin' it all night long
Sure feels like love, the best I remember
Sure feels like love, the best I recall
It's so good, it feels like the first time I reached out
And really went for it all
Sure feels like love, 'cause I don't remember
The last time that love felt this strong
So you're either gonna have to stop what you're doin' to me right now
Or you're gonna have to keep doin' it all night long
You're either gonna have to stop what you're doin' to me right now
Or you're gonna have to keep doin' it all night longGot a long list of things to do
And it begins and ends with gettin' over you
I can't quit 'til I'm through
I get up with the sun and I go down with the moon
Pain and tears can't be all there is
Is it any wonder I'm feeling six feet under?
Baby, you're nothing but too much trouble
Gotta bury this love and bury the shovel
Gonna dig me a hole and make it deep
I'm gonna lay it down, what's left of us
And then put this thing to sleep
Let my soul rest in peace
I'm gotta nail down the lid on these stone cold memories
Pain and tears can't be all there is
Is it any wonder I'm feeling six feet under?
Baby, you're nothing but too much trouble
Gotta bury this love and bury the shovelIf it ain't love then
Let's don't even let it start
Lets leave it alone
If it ain't love then
Let's don't temp our foolish hearts
Lets leave it alone
Happiness is free just like a rollin' stone
And only love can make it stay at home
Feeling's have a way of mixin' right with wrong
If it ain't love let's leave it alone
If it ain't love then
Let's don't even let it start
Lets leave it alone
If it ain't love then
Let's don't temp our foolish hearts
Lets leave it alone
Togetherness can fade like the music of a song
It comes and goes like the breaking of the dawn
How could we hang on to somethin' that was gone
If it ain't love let's leave it alone
If it ain't love then
Let's don't even let it start
Lets leave it alone
If it ain't love then
Let's don't temp our foolish hearts
Lets leave it alone
If it ain't love then
Let's don't even let it start
Lets leave it alone
If it ain't love then
Let's don't temp our foolish hearts
Lets leave it aloneWhen you give it up for gone
But you're still digging in the mind
And your staring out the window
Saying everything will be just fine
Keepin' with whole affair
Every word seems out of line
No matter what angle you get
It's polished till it shines
Take a guess at where I stand
Pick a number one to two
Take a look at the back of your hand
Just like you know it
You know me too
And when you say who the hell am I living with
What just went down
Where did this come from
Why are all my colors faded brown
When did it change
What's with the rage
Who's the dude with the extrall
What's the verse the line the chapter the page
Take a guess at where I stand
Pick a number one to two
Take a look at the back of your hand
Just like you know it
You know me too
You think you're lost without any place left to go
Like you need one of those kisses long and slow
First glance is not what it seems
But there's some things that I just know
Like you take two sugars with a splash of cream
You take a guess
Where I stand oh pick a number
One to two
Then take a look
Back of your hand
Just like you know it
You know me too
Yeah like you know it
You know me too
Just like you know it
You know me tooWell they shouldn't have played that good,
I got carried away and let the music,
Go to my head.
Well she shouldn't have worn that dress,
The way it curled around when she was spinnin',
Just killed me dead.
My heart began to tell my body and my soul,
That it had gotten in the mood to lose control.
Oh no!
When did neon light turn into moon glow?
When did that jukebox turn into a rainbow?
I'm about to give into this urge.
Once more slow dance,
With her arms around me,
One more long glance,
And nothing will slow down me,
I've got no chance,
If I'm not in love I'm on the verge.
All I wanted to be was cool.
It ain't my style to over heat,
Much less burn.
But as we floated across the floor,
All at once I flashed right past the point,
Of no return.
And when we said goodnight,
The sun was on the rise,
And any stars that hadn't set,
Had fallen in my eyes.
Oh no!
When did neon light turn into moon glow?
When did that jukebox turn into a rainbow?
I'm about to give into this urge.
Once more slow dance,
With her arms around me,
One more long glance,
And nothing will slow down me,
I've got no chance,
If I'm not in love I'm on the verge.Don't you want to sing a new gospel
Don't you want to find a way to rise above
If we both believe in the resurrection
We can find a new life for our love
It's a new gospel
Don't you want to hear the good news of forgiveness
Sins against our love are washed away
We have come through the valley of temptation
We have found a way to keep the faith
It's a new gospel
Well you might say I'm like a new apostle
You might say this love it is my creed
But I will go on preaching this new gospel
It's the saving grace for you and me
It's a new gospel
Let love, sweet love be born againShe can take the morning rain
Falling on my window pane
And turn it into sunshine in my mind
And she can take the darkest night
And brighten it with a love sweet light
And I'm satisfied just knowing she's that kind
And I can feel so down and out
But she knows what it's all about
And she can help me leave it all behind
There's something in the way she smiles
That seems to brighten all my trials
It's good to know my woman is that kind
She's that kind that I'm thankful to the Lord above
For sending me that kind of woman for me to love
If I could live another life and I could choose another wife
I wouldn't change a thing 'cause she's that kind
She's that kind that I'm thankful to the Lord above
For sending me that kind of woman for me to love
If I could live another life and I could choose another wife
I wouldn't change a thing 'cause she's that kind
No, I wouldn't change a thing 'cause she's that kindI wouldn't put it past me
I wouldn't press my luck
If I were you
I don't believe
I'd take that chance with love
A big chance you'll be taking
The wrong odds is what you're staking us on
Oh and any love you wind up making
Won't pay back half
Of all we've lost
No, I wouldn't play so boldly
Or push a sure thing too long
'Cause your luck can get thin
Bet's not winnin'
Pretty soon love's up and gone
A big chance you'll be taking
The wrong odds is what you're staking us on
Oh and any love you wind up making
Won't pay back half
Of all we've lost
No, so I wouldn't put it past me
I wouldn't keep risking heartache
In any more games like these
'Cause there's a way to lose hard with every card
You'll find out on your knees
A big chance you'll be taking
The wrong odds is what you're staking us on
Oh and any love you wind up making
Won't pay back half
Of all we've lost
I wouldn't put it past me
No, I wouldn't press my luck
If I were you
I don't believe
I'd take that chance with love
A big chance you'll be taking
The wrong odds is what you're staking us on
Oh and any love you wind up making
Won't pay back half
Of all we've lost
No I wouldn't put it past meOh, I was standing by the bedside
Where my fevered mother lay
When she called me close beside her
And I thought I heard her say
I've just seen the rock of ages
Jacob's ladder hanging down
I've just crossed the river of Jordan
Now, my son, I'm homeward bound
Oh, as we gathered by her bedside
Tears begin to fill our eyes
Then she called me close beside her
And whispered softly her good-byes
Pine trees blowing cross the mountain
Where forever she will lay
There she'll rest beside the fountain
There she'll sleep beneath the clayShe's been playin' them low life honky tonks for thirty years in Texas.
She's sick and tired of all them Reba songs they keep requestin'.
She's about to lose her voice, her hair's fallin' out and ain't nobody clappin'.
So she think's she'll shape her head, buy a boom box and just turn to rappin'.
She can't keep up, with them country healthers,
Gonna learn to shake her boobies, just like Salt N' Peppa.
She done gone funky, a brand new tattoo.
She done gone funky, a big nose ring too.
She done gone funky, her favouite rap song's "Shoop".
She done gone funky,
Hah, you go girl!
Well, he never was good at suckin' up to all them country disc jockeys.
It seemed like dag-blammed week, then some new hat act bumped him off the Opry.
He had to sell his bus, his house, his cows: ain't had a hit since the sixties.
Well he's fed with hearin' about: Travis, Garth, Tim McGraw, Collin Raye, Billy Ray Cyrus, John Michael Montgomery, and Joe Diffie.
He saw Johnny Cash on MTV,
Bought a new new toupee, said: "That's the place for me."
He done gone funky, too ahead for his boots.
He done gone funky, burned his cowboy boots.
He done gone funky, wearin' platform shoes.
He done gone funky!
Oh, Suki.
Oh well, he moved up to Nashville, had big dreams of being a songwriter.
Ha ha, 'bout the only things he's written down lately are some orders down at Brown's diner.
If everybody's gone country, like Ali Jackson says,
Gonna move to Los Angeles and buy him a drum machine.
He done gone funky, hangin' out with old Sloop.
Doggy Dog, sippin' on gin and juice
He done gone funky, do wets for two live crew.
He done gone funky.
I feel good.
He done gone funky.
He done gone funky.
He done gone funky.
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, funky.
He done gone funky.
She done gone funky.When you just walk by me ever so casually oh how I long to be just your woman
Just a brush of your lips and my heart just jumps and skips
At your slight fingertips I'm your woman
And if you ever take me in your arms real tight
For a moment I'll feel wrong to be feeling so right
And if you ever kiss me a hungry goodnight I'll be too weak to fight I'm your woman
Like a rose in full bloom sending out sweet perfume
I know you're in the room without looking
I've been wildly upset since the moment we met you won't let me forget I'm a woman
And if you ever take meThree fishers went sailing out into the west,
Oh, into the west as the sun went down;
Each thought of the woman,
That loved him the best,
And the children stood watching them out on the town.
For men must work and the women must weep,
For there's little to earn and many to keep;
And the harbour bar be moaning?
The harbour bar be moaning.
Three wives sat up in the lighthouse tower,
And trimmed the lamps as the sun went down;
And they looked at the squall,
And they looked at the shower,
The nightbird came rolling in ragged and drowned.
Men must work and the women must weep,
Tho storms be sudden and the waters be deep;
And the harbour bar be moaning?
The harbour bar be moaning.
*Instrumental*
Men must work and the women must weep,
Tho storms be sudden and the waters be deep;
And the harbour bar be moaning?
The harbour bar be moaning.
Three corpses lay out on the shining sand,
In morning green as the tide went down;
And the women were weeping and wringing their hands,
For those who would never come back to the town.
Men must work and the women must weep,
For the sooner it's over the sooner to sleep;
And goodbye to the bar and its moaning,
Goodbye to the bar and its moaning.The wheel of fortune,
Goes spinnin' around.
Will the arrow point my way.
Will this be my day.
Oh, wheel of fortune,
Please don't pass me by,
Let me know the magic of,
A kiss and a sigh.
While the wheel is spinning, spinning, spinning,
I'll not dream of winning fortune or fame.
While the wheel is turning, turning, turning,
I'll be yearning, yearning for love's precious flame.
Oh, wheel of fortune,
I'm hopin', somehow,
If you ever smile on me,
Please let it be now.
While the wheel is spinning, spinning, spinning,
I'll not dream of winning fortune or even fame.
While the wheel is turning, turning, turning,
I'll be yearning, yearning for love's precious flame.
Oh, wheel of fortune,
I'm hopin', somehow,
If you ever smile on me,
Please let it be now.I just don't like this kind of living when nobody's lonesome for me
I'm heading down the long lost highway may you never be alone like me
Your cold cold crazy cheating heart gave me the lovesick blues
I can't help it if you win again you know I still want you
I'd like to turn back the years when we heard the wedding bells chime
When I was howling at the moon and your cheating heart was mine
A mansion on the hill is a house without love
Why don't you love me like you used to do
You're gonna change or I'm a gonna leave but I could never be ashamed of you
I hear that lonesome whistle blowing never again will I knock on your door
I'm sorry for you my friend but why should we try anymore
Jambalaya and ol' Kaw-Liga go on and set the woods on fire
From now on you'll be moaning the blues for I'm a long gone daddy nowWell, I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming
Saying something about a queen
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at mother nature on the run
In the twentieth century
Look at mother nature on the run
In the twentieth century
I was lying in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eye
I was hoping for replacement
When the sun burst through the sky
There was a band playing in my head
And I felt like I could cry
I was thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
Thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There was children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream, the loading had begun
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new homeExpecting me to clean my house out
Under my fridge I found the roach bug
They were eating my potatoes
They even got to raise a fambly
It ain't no failing I just want 'em out
I live in filth and now I want 'em out
They don't even hep me to pay my rent
They even eat the cash I hadn't spent
The son of bum ain't like a stink bug
They aren't like the rolly pollies
They don't behave like a cicada
But there better than the crab bug
If I could only dream about them
And bathe them in the new age light
I'd put cookies in my bedroom
And gladly let them spend night in my bed
In my bedWell today's a gonna be my lucky day gonna let the good times roll
Today's the day she's coming home to stay gonna let the good times roll
Gonna meet my baby by a quarter to ten gonna let the good times roll
Gonna be at the station when the train rolls in gonna let the good times roll
Gonna let the good times roll gonna let the good times roll
Gonna be at the station when the train rolls in gonna let the good times roll
Gonna kiss my baby gonna hold her tight gonna let the good times roll
Gonna hug her up with all of my might gonna let the good times roll
Gonna meet my baby come face to face gonna let the good times roll
Gonna dance a little jig all over the place gonna let the good times roll
Gonna let the good times roll gonna let the good times roll
Gonna dance a little jig...Darling I need my freedom
I've been my own man so far
I never felt so free
'Til I got wrapped up in your arms
I know the heartaches
Love can sometimes put you through
Opening up my heart
Was the last thing I should do
But I would for you
You got me thinking things girl
I never even thought about
You got me feeling feelings
That I never would allow
I passed up a chance for love a time or two
'Cause I was determined not to be somebody's fool
But I would for you
All of my friends say they can't believe it's true
I swore up and down that I would never say, "I do"
But I would for you
I would for youIf every time that you got hurt it left a scar
And if every dream you ever had broke your heart
If every time you made a plan the world came to an end
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again
If broken dreams are all it seems you've ever known
And hurt's the only thing you can depend upon
And if you should find misery to be your only friend
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again
If every time you look up a cloud should hide the sun
Pay dearly for each kindness ever shown to anyone
If everything you try should fail before you can begin
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love againYou just kissed me good morning so I know you're standing there
But can you hear the sounds before goodbye and nobody cares
Maybe I'm wrong but I have the strangest feeling you're gone
What was that you said to me my mind was out to play
With some mem'ries I saved up especially for this kind of day
Guess I'm wrong but I have the strangest feeling you're gone
There's no need to hide it we're just putting off the pain
And goodbye ain't so bad it's just a different kind of rain
Like lonely dewdrops on a daisy when the evening sun goes down
Or like hearing footsteps echo in an empty neon town
Go on and get it over with if can't hurt me anymore
Than these transparent blindfolds that love put on before
Wish I was wrong but I have the strangest feeling you're gone
Go on and built a better world I'll do what I can with mine
Maybe someday we can love again at some other place or time
Goodbye darling I have the strangest feeling you're gone
Goodbye darling I have the strangest feeling you're gone
Goodbye hossI used to think maybe you loved me now baby I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day when you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down
'Cause I just can't wait 'til you write me you're coming around
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
And don't it feel good
Hey, alright now
And don't it feel good, hey
I used to think maybe you loved me, now I know that it's true
And I don't want to spend my whole life, just waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day, no no no
I said baby I just want you back
And I want you to stay (Oh yeah now!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
And don't it feel good
Hey, alright now
And don't it feel good (Yeah!)
And don't it feel good
Walking on sunshine
Walking on sunshine
I feel the love, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real
I feel the love, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real
I'm on sunshine baby (Ow! Oh yeah!)
I'm on sunshine baby (Ow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
And don't it feel good (Hey! Alright now!)
And don't it feel good (I'll say it I'll say it I'll say it again now)
And don't it feel good (Hey yeah now!)
And don't it feel good (Don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it)
Feel good
And don't it feel good
And don't it feel good
And don't it feel good
And don't it feel good
Now don't it feel goodI love you for all the wrong reasons
I need you every night and every day
Yes, I love you for all the wrong reasons
'Cause you love me in all the right ways
Shimmering lips that kiss me
And a body to make a fool of any man
I'd like to run away, but
I just haven't had all that I can stand
Our love is like the darkness,
It just keeps on getting deeper with the night
And though we'd never say "I love you",
You know it feels so good when we get it right
I love you for all the wrong reasons
I need you every night and every day
Yes, I love you for all the wrong reasons
'Cause you love me in all the right ways
There's no reason for us to be here,
But we are and we have been for some time
Yeah, we both have other lovers, but
What they don't know they sure don't seem to mind
So we throw it to the wind
We don't worry bout these pleasures that we steal
'Cause there's oh so many reasons, but
It's really how we make each other feel
I love you for all the wrong reasons
I need you every night and every day
Yes, I love you for all the wrong reasons
'Cause you love me in all the right ways
I love you for all the wrong reasons
I need you every night and every day
Yes, I love you for all the wrong reasons
'Cause you love me in all the right ways...Here's my grandpa's old Gibson
And a girl of no importance
A shot of whiskey sitting on the bar
Yeah I used to give a damn, I used to try real hard
But I'll give in tonight, chances are
One foot on the narrow way
And one foot on the ledge
Sifting through the devil's lies
From what the good book says
If I'm goin' any where
I'll probably go too far
Probably away from you
Chances are, chances are
There's a lonely corner waiting
To seats left for playing
I'll tell her everything she wants to hear
I'm not worse love this making
I'm better at the breakin'
A guy like me knows how to disappear
One foot on the narrow way , and one foot on the ledge
Sifting through the devil's lies, from what the good book says
If I'm goin' any where
I'll probably go too far
Probably away from you
Chances are, chances are
Hold me like I mean it
Say 'til you believe it
And we'll see if we can fill an empty heart
But I won't tell you what the chances are
One foot on the narrow way , and one foot on the ledge
Sifting through the devil's lies, from what the good book says
If I'm goin' any where
I'll probably go too far
Probably away from you
Chances are, chances areShe was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati on a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her mama and her daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go, and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind, and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, "I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm on."
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me
Oh, why, ohWe tried to pick the most unlikely places
Where no one's out to know us by our name
And for a while we shared the sweet affection
That makes it worth the sorrow and the shame
Of lovin' on back streets and living on main
Suffering hell through the daylight for the heaven darkness brings
Two hearts in the shadows trading passion for pain
Lovin' on back streets and living on main
In the morning when I face the one who owns me
And she confronts me with some things I can't explain
And once again I'll hate myself for livin'
And wonder just how long my might can stand the strain
Of lovin' on back streets and living on main
Suffering hell through the daylight for the heaven darkness brings
Two hearts in the shadows trading passion for pain
Lovin' on back streets and living on main
Lovin' on back streets and living on mainI know what you do and it drives me insane
No matter what I do you never will change
You just keep denying this thing that you do
But someday, someway, I'll have proof that it's true
I know it's been goin' on now for quite a few years
And many is the time that it's nearly driven me to tears
I can't sleep at night but you don't seem to care
I'm growin' old young, you've put grey in my hair
I've tried talkin' to ya but you just turned away
You won't even listen to what I've got to say
I've known for a long time now that I had to find me a way
To catch you in action so I schemed night and day
I thought and I thought and I devised me a plan
I knew I had to confront you with the proof in my hand
So I took a recorder and I placed it under your bed
And then I placed the microphone right at your headPassei, flagrei, olhei
E vi o que nÃ£o queria ver
A tremedeira me tomou
Quase que na hora enfartei
Quem Ã© o cara que chegou
Juntinho com vocÃª na balada?
Bem que vocÃª me avisou
Pra eu dar valor ao que tinha em casa
TÃ¡ tÃ¡ tÃ¡ tÃ¡
TÃ´ nervoso, tÃ´ passando mal
Quem mandou eu nÃ£o te dar moral?
TÃ´ suando frio...
TÃ¡ tÃ¡ tÃ¡ tÃ¡
NÃ£o acreditei quando falou
Que desencanou do nosso amor
To sofrendo aqui, volta pra mim.(2x)
Ai ai ai ai ai
Ai ai ai ai ai...The moon is on the rise it stares at me tonight. I'm reminded of the arms that held me tight. Last time I held you it ended all to soon we were lying underneath a yellow moon.
There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky oh I wonder if you're watching it too. There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky wherever you are it's watching over you. Oh shine on, shine on yellow moon.
Sometimes we sit and talk me and that old moon. I ask him are you happy or if you're blue. I start to reminisce to summers night in June, we fell in love underneath a yellow moon.
There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky oh I wonder if you're watching it too. There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky wherever you are it's watching over you. Oh shine on, shine on yellow moon.
There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky oh I wonder if you're watching it too. There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky wherever you are it's watching over you. Oh shine on, shine on yellow moon.Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,
Calling for you and for me.
See, on the portals, He's waiting and watching;
Watching for you and for me.
[Chorus]
Come home, come home,
Ye who are weary come home;
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling;
Calling, "O sinner, come home!"
O for the wonderful love He has promised,
Promised for you and for me.
Though we have sinned He has mercy and pardon;
Pardon for you and for me.
[Chorus: x2]Each time I hold somebody new my arms grow cold aching for you
No one can take your place darling in my embrace I'll never be free
And when my lips burn with desire no other's kiss can put up the fire
Though I may try and try no one can satisfy this longing in me
I'll never be free from your smile so tender the sweet surrender in your eyes
How can I be free when I still remember how you could thrill me with a sigh
Just like a chain bound to my heart your love remains when we're apart
Each kiss I gave to you made me a slave to you I'll never be free
I'll never be free from your smile...There's an oil well down on Johnson's road
Where we'd go to be alone
I never thought i'd go there by myself
I stood there calling out your name
No one answered just the same
The silence speaks for itself
Well, I've been high and I've been low
And I've walked through the fires of hell
Are you coming back, lord, I don't know
I guess the silence speaks for itself
The last time you talked to me
I did all the talkin' now I see
You were telling me there was someone else
What i'd give to hear your voice
But i'm not given any choice
'cause the silence speaks for itself
Well, I've been high and I've been low
And I've walked through the fires of hell
Are you coming back, lord, I don't know
I guess the silence speaks for itself
The last time you talked to me
I did all the talkin' now I see
You were telling me there was someone else
What i'd give to hear your voice
But i'm not given any choice
'cause the silence speaks for itself
I guess the silence...Snow up on the mountains
Sun lay low across the cloudy sky
I've been feeding this far for so long
The fame is gone
I can second guess the storm
'till my heart ?
But I'll just stay inside
There's no way that I'll take any chances of my own
What if I get it wrong
Another season come and gone
Proving hard to sing a song
For too few summer skies
All the tourists barely even say goodbye
Back again
Now there's lovers all around
Just some ? will lay down
I don't, to like
It won't be my eyes
That tell me if they found
Fair weather friends
What ever happened to the change of seasons
What ever happened to all my reasons
To open up my heart and let it be
What ever happened to falling in love
What ever happened to me
Sun up on the mountains
Somebody said it happen yesterday
But I guess I can't remember back that far
It's not all there
But the sky was probably blue
Doesn't matter when to view
Depends on where you are
What kind of heart you might be looking through
Or if you can (care?)
What ever happened to the change of seasons
What ever happened to all my reasons
To open up my heart and let it be
What ever happened to falling in love
What ever happened to me
What ever happened to the change of seasons
What ever happened to all my reasons
To open up my heart and let it be
What ever happened to falling in love
What ever happened to me
What ever happened to the change of seasons
What ever happened to all my reasons
Oh just let it be
What ever happened to falling in love
What ever happened to me
Does anyone remember me?
What ever happened to falling in love
What ever happened to meI am thinking today of that beautiful land
I shall reach when the sun goeth down
When through wonderful grace by my Saviour I stand
Will there be any stars in my crown.
Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown
When at evening the sun goeth down
When I wake with the blest in those mansions of rest
Will there be any stars in my crown.
--- Instrumental ---
In the strength of the Lord let me labor and pray
Let me watch as a winner of souls
That bright stars may be mine in the glorious day
When his praise like the sea billow rolls.
Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown
When at evening the sun goeth down
When I wake with the blest in those mansions of rest
Will there be any stars in my crown.
--- Mandolin Instrumental ---
Oh, what joy it will be when his face I behold
Living gems at his feet to lay down
It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold
Should there be any stars in my crown.
--- Banjo Instrumental ---
Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown
When at evening the sun goeth down
When I wake with the blest in those mansions of rest
Will there be any stars in my crown...Oh well I'm tired and so weary but I must go along
Till my Lord comes and calls me calls me away oh yes
Oh well the morning's so bright and the lamb is the light
And the night, night is as black as the sea oh yes
There will be peace, peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness no sorrow no troubles I'll see
There will be peace, peace in the valley for me
Well the bear will be gentle and the wolf will be tame
And the lion shall lay down, down by the lamb oh yes
And the beast from the wild will be lead by little child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am oh yes
There will be peaceLet me rest at the end of my journey
I'm weary, tired, and old
Let me rest at the end of my journey
Heaven is my home and my goal
Old paint is tired, his feet are all sore
We'll ride the range no more
Let me rest at the end of my journey
Heaven is my home and my goal
A cowboy's life on the old Texas trail
Herding doggies is all that he knows
A cowboy's life on the old cattle trail
Leads from Texas to old MexicoI've had one of those days
Good for nothing kind of days
I've had hard luck, bad luck and no luck at all
Girl I need you to be my soft place to fall
So lay your pretty head on my side of the bed
I turn it on and on
When I turn off those bedroom lights
Say you want me to stay
Kiss my worries away
Far away
I've had one of those days
Before nothing kind of days
Baby I need one of your nights
I want to hold you tight
Fine wine and candle lights
I've had red lights, bar fights
Bright lights blinding me
Girl I need your touch to set me free
So lay your pretty head on my side of the bed
I turn it on and on
When I turn off those bedroom lights
Say you want me to stay
Kiss my worries away
Far away
I've had one of those days
Before nothing kind of days
Baby I need one of your nights
Girl we got that kind of romance
One that will dance without even touching the ground
Remember that night on your street
I said I'd sweep you of your feet
Well forever is forever
And I'll never gonna let you down
Never ever gonna let you down
So lay your pretty head on my side of the bed
I turn it on and on
When I turn off those bedroom lights
Say you want me to stay
Kiss my worries away
Far away
I've had one of those days
Before nothing kind of days
Baby I need one of your nights
One of your nights
I've had one of those days
Good for nothing kind of daysI was sittin' with him on his front porch swing
Soaking up wisdom and Grandma's sweet tea
Listening to his stories, man, he'd done it all
His tour in the Army and his wilder days
Raising my daddy and bailing his hay
He cut off a twist of tobacco, stuck it in his jaw
Cocked back his hat with a sideways grin and
Gave me that ole wink
He said, I can tell you something 'bout most anything
[Chorus]
But don't ask me about a woman
All I know is boy they're something
They're tender and they're tough
Can break it down and lift you up
Don't ask me about a woman
That's some complicated stuff
They ain't made to figure out
They're just made to love
He said, boy I've lived nearly eighty years
There's a lot of know how, between these ears
But when it comes to your grandma
I'm still your age
It took me a long, long time to learn
Loving a woman is full of left turns
The more they change, the more they stay the same
Son, it's been that way since the beginning of time
We're behind the wheel but just along for the ride
[Chorus]
Fast forward ten years it's Saturday night
She's changed three times, says her hair ain't right
My mind reels back to the time and place
When I heard my grandpa say
Don't ask me about a woman
Boy, that's some complicated stuff
They ain't made to figure out
They're just made to love
Now I know what he's talkin' about
They're just made to loveHey, she?s a piratey soul
Full a' vinagar and glitter
She is a song of her own
From down the wrong end of the river
Wild, like the lily-a-passion
Have you ever had the honors
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
Hey, when your carnival rose
Sows the kiss of belladonna
There ain't no takin? it slow
For the avalanches? daughter
Wild, like the lily-a-passion
Have you ever had the honors
Oh no, no
Oh, no, no
Oh,no,no,no,no,no,no
She is the lily-a-passion
She is the lily-a-passion
She is the lily-a-passion
She is the lily-uh huh
She is a canary royal
Save the curse a' Desdamona
Bright, bright, bright is the blush of her smile
Like the apples a' Pomona
Wild, like the lily-a-passion
Have you ever had the honors
Oh no, no, no,no,no, noKnowing what I know now
I should've had a cow
I didn't realize
You were to be despised
I must have been
One of history's stupidest men
'cause everything was perfect in my head
Until the lead started hitting me
With benefit of hindsight
I can see your ass wasn't right
Maybe I'm mighty dull
But you're pathological
I never guessed
You meant no, when you said yes
Everything was perfect in my head
Until the lead started hitting me
It didn't take long at all
Until the zen started to to fall
All of the people you faked
Suddenly saw their mistake
You never thought
That I could survive the shock
Everything was perfect in my head
Until the lead started hitting meI was there (I was there)
I was there (I was there)
When love crashed and burned
I was there.
I was there when love came around
With sweet, warm kisses
I was there when it burned into desire
I was there when it ran into a raging river
And then turned into a runaway wildfire.
I was there (I was there)
I was there (I was there)
When love came around
I was there.
And one thing certain
I did all the hurtin'
At love's final curtain
I was there.
--- Instrumental ---
I was there when love came in
Like a living tornado
And I was there when it blew out of control
I was there when something quickly turned into nothing
Just a hopeless, helpless dream gone up in smoke.
I was there (I was there)
I was there (I was there)
When love came around
I was there.
And one thing certain
I did all the hurtin'
At love's final curtain
I was there.
I was there (I was there)
I was there (I was there)
When love came around
I was there.
And one thing certain
I did all the hurtin'
At love's final curtain
I was there.
I was there (I was there)
I was there (I was there)
When love came around
I was there.
And one thing certain
I did all the hurtin'...I knew this morning as soon as the phone rang that crazy woman had hurt you again
That's why I told you to come on over
The coffee is warm so are the arms that you fit so nicely in
Poor Sweet Baby Poor Sweet Baby did my baby spend another sleepless night
Poor Sweet Baby come to mama
Let Mama love your pain away and make everything alright
If she don't love you why don't she let a real woman light your fire
Your too big a boy to go to bed hungry and the way that I need you
I could feed you anything your heart desires
Poor Sweet baby Poor Sweet Baby did my baby spend another sleepless night
Poor Sweet Baby Come to mama
Let mama love your pain away and make everything alright Poor Sweet BabyWhatever happened to tenderness it just disappeared with gentleness
Oh did they run away with togetherness oh where has our love gone
Where has our love gone what's happened to you and me
Who's to blame for all of this pain and where has our love gone
[ steel ]
Once we were blessed with happiness once there was no place for loneliness
Now all I've got is forgetfulness oh where has our love gone
Where has our love gone...
Oh where has our love goneDown on her street, I've got someone
I really want you to meet
In good time, like all things
A prayer for a plum
Up all night waiting for the mail to come
In a lightless window
I've been afraid to depend on love
And it's fare thee well my friend
I'll see you at the promised land
Where the wind is laughter
And that home we never made
Is waiting in the desert shade
Happily ever after
Down on her street, I've got someone
I really want you to meet
In good time, like all things
Step into place, take my heart
Put it in a pillowcase
It's been still for hours
We can get high down on Old Kings Road
And watch as the lights explode
I can get lost if you want me to
And it's fare thee well my friend
I'll see you at the promised land
Where the wind is laughter
And that home we never made
Is waiting in the desert shade
Happily ever afterI may say that I don't care hold up head up in the air
Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call
But when the day is through my heartaches start anew
And that's when I miss you most of all
And my arms keep reaching for you my eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you and my shoes keep walking back to you
No matter how much I pretend I wish I had you back again
For nothing else means half as much as you
My world just seemed to die the day you said goodbye
And I can't forget no matter what I do
And my arms keep reaching for you...
And my shoes keep walking back to youAs we were dressing to go out our little girl and boy
Came in and asked if they could go this time
We told them little girls and boys don't belong at parties
And that they should be in bed asleep by nine
The babysitter came in then and we kissed the kids goodbye
And told them that we'd be home soon and told them not to cry
Then we left for the party like we'd so often done
Thinking only of ourselves and not our little ones
The party started out wild and it grew wilder as the night wore on
With drinking laughing telling dirty jokes nobody thinkin' of home
Then the strangest feeling came over me and it chilled me to the bones
And I told my wife that we'd better leave the party
Cause I felt that we were needed at home
As we rode along I got to thinking of how the kids that morning
Had asked if we would take them to church the next day
And how I'd put 'em off like I'd so often done
By saying we'd probably get home too late
Then my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of sirens
As they cut through the still night air
Then we turned down our street that's when we saw the fire
The rest was like a nightmare
We took their little bodies to church the next day
Though we'd left the party early we still got home too lateWhen I go don't cry for me
In my fathers arms I'll be
The wounds this world left on my soul
Will all be healed and I'll be whole
Sun and moon will be replaced
With the light of Jesus' face
And I will not be ashamed
For my savior knows my name
It don't matter where you bury me
I'll be home and I'll be free
It don't matter where I lay
All my tears be washed away
Gold and silver blind the eye
Temporary riches lie
Come and eat from heaven's store
Come and drink and thirst no more
So weep not for me my friend
When my time below does end
For my life belongs to him
Who will raise the dead again
It don't matter where you bury me
I'll be home and I'll be free
It don't matter where I lay
All my tears be washed away(spoken)
(Alright now, this is a little modern-day love song for ya.)
People at this honky-tonk,
they're about to drive me insane.
To tell you the truth, my darlin',
you're the only reason I came.
But your beauty's so distractin',
hope it don't lead to my demise.
Can you please tell your boobs
to stop lookin' at my eyes.
They're playing crummy rap music,
and there ain't even a band.
Ah, And I wouldn't even be here,
but you hold my heart in your hands.
(Yes you do, baby.)
So before I lose my cool,
and start actin' like them other dirty guys,
would you please tell your boobs
to stop lookin' at my eyes.
(rap-style: Yo there, brother, we're giving' you a shout.
Got the bitches in stitches, and we're all hangin' out.
Lookin' good in the hood, tell you what it's all about.)
(Shoot that rapper, and let the guitar player play.)
If it wasn't for the alcohol,
I would be quoting Voltair.
But with that cute rocking' bod' of yours,
I can't do nothin' but stare.
Let's go to your place, baby,
stay up and watch the sun rise.
But first please tell your boobs
to stop lookin' at my eyes.
I'll be your sex object.
I'll be your good ol' boy toy.
We'll have the perfect redneck wedding,
then a little bundle of joy.
And somewhere down the road
we'll look back and we'll laugh about this night.
When I said, "Tell your boobs
to stop lookin' at my eyes."
Yeah, later down the road
we'll look back and we'll laugh about this night.
(Yes we will.)
Right now won't you tell your boobs
to stop lookin' at my eyes.
(ending: repeat 3 more times)
Stick out your boobsies
Stick out your boobsies
Stick out your boobs nowOkay kids, I'm gonna sing you a song now
'Bout a monkey and an elephant
It's all happened a long time ago
Whenever I say "a long time ago"
You all jump in there with me
Okay? Are you ready?
Well, once the world was full of monkeys a long time ago
And the elephants with the big long trunkies a long time ago
And the elephants swam in the Zazafram Sea
And the monkey swung from the zilibum tree
And life was silly as it could be a long time ago
One day the elephant was feelin' spunky a long time ago
She went to have a talk with the monkey a long time ago
And the elephant said, "Oh Lordy, me
I think I'm in love with the bumblebee
Do you think she's a little too little for me a long time ago"
Now the monkey said "You're thinkin' like a donkey a long time ago
Ah, she's so small and you're sorta chunky a long time ago
So sit right down upon my knee, I'll tell you why your love can never be
It's a physical impossibility any old time at all"
Now the elephant's tears went plunkity plunky a long time ago
Then he went home to pack his trunky a long time ago
He said "I see that bee was not for me
So he went and married a little gray flee"
And they were happy as they could be
And they had children one two three
But if you wanna know how please don't ask me
It was a long, long time agoShe woke up one Sunday morning
She said a prayer and asked for strength
She put her makeup on just perfect
For the first time in a long time
The mirror showed her grace
She heard him stirring in the kitchen
Last night's whiskey in the air
She could hear him carryin' on and cussin'
Then the woman in the mirror said
You gotta get outta here
'Cause you've been broken down and kicked around
One too many times
You finally found the strength
And he ain't gonna break my faith
She said I might go back to school
I know you take me for a fool
Despite what you say
Something occured to me today
Guess what, I am pretty
He took a drag off his cigarette
That patronizing look on his face
And he said 'Ah, Here we go again
Got that little suitcase in your hand
Let me guess, you're gonna find your dreams today'
And she said, you know, I just might but either way
I'm gonna get out, I'm gonna get out of this
God-forsaken place
'Cause you've been broken down and kicked around
One too many times
You finally found the strength
And he ain't gonna break my faith
She said I might go back to school
I know you take me for a fool
Despite what you say
Something occured to me today
'Cause I've been broken down and kicked around
One too many times
Despite what you say
Something occured to me today
I am pretty
I am pretty
I am prettyI wanna feel that ocean breeze that's got me wrapped around it's fingers
I wanna hear a southern drawl and every word that lingers
I need a Sunday morning song by a just got baptized singer
I been away too long, somebody take me home
I need a glass of sweet sun tea brewed out in the backyard
I wanna see a kudzu vine sneaking up on a junk car
I need to sit on my old back porch 'til the world lets go of my arm
I been away too long, oh somebody take me home
Lord have mercy on a poor boy's soul
Crank it up and make these big wheels roll
Can you get me there by the morning light
And make everything alright
'Cause I been away too long
Oh somebody take me home
I love this job, I do
But my soul is wearing thin
Oh I gotta get lost in where I'm from
And find myself again
Oh I been away too long
Somebody take me home
I wanna waste a day with my little man throwing me that old football
Soend sometime with Daddy's girls catching up on what's going on
Then remind the woman I love just how much I miss her when I'm gone
Oh Lord have mercy on a poor boy's soul
Crank it up and make these big wheels roll
Can you get me there by morning light
Oh lord have mercy on my soul
Crank it up and make these big wheels roll
I wanna be there by morning light
It'll make everything alright
Cause I've been away too long
Oh, I've been away too long
I been away too long
Somebody please, somebody take me home
Oh home, home, homeShe found a cowboy
And I hear they've settled down somewhere out west
I guess it's for the best
He in Deo Rio
Nothin' seems to change except the weather
And I can't forget her
Chorus
Shes goes runnin' through my mind
Like that Rio Grande river winds through the desert
And I can't forget her
No, I can't forget her
There's a senorita that is waitin' just over the border line
For me tonight
And I could hold her
And this tequila could help me love her
But there's still another
(chorus)
These endless starlit nights
Remind me of her eyes
And the warm breeze is like her arms wrapped around me
(chorus)
She found a cowboy
and I hear they've settled down somewhere out west
I guess it's for the best
And I can't forget her
I just can't forger herShe keeps it all together
I always come unwound
She's cool calm and collected
I wanna paint the town
She's like a Sunday morning
I'm a dancehall Saturday night
She's like a stain glass window
I'm a lonestar neon light
She has another side
That no one sees but me
She is the only one
That brings me to my knees
There's something about Sinatra
And a bottle of Chardonnay
Without a single word
She takes my breath away
When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you, need to love you
Right now kind of look in her eyes
She's always lookin' so fine
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look
She sparkles like a diamond
She twinkles like a star
She's like a ray of sunshine
That always melts my heart
And when I'm feeling empty
Her love makes me whole
Just like a country breeze
That soothes my weary soul
When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you, need to love you
Right now that kind of look in her eyes
She's always lookin' so fine
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that
Slow dancin'
Romancin'
She's up to something
Wearin' nothin' but her beautiful smile
She's up to something
Wearin' nothin' but a beautiful smile
When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you, need to love you
Right now that kind of look in her eyes
She's always lookin' so fine
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look
There's something about Sinatra
And a bottle of Chardonnay
Without a single word
She takes my breath away
She's like a Sunday morning
I'm a Saturday night
She's like a stain glass window
I'm a neon lightYou are a sunbeam and you will shine forever
Forever in our hearts now that you're gone
You are a sunbeam and you will shine wherever
Wherever your soul decides to roam
I wish you could have stayed a little longer
And shone more of your sunlight in our lives
But having known you I can feel a little stronger
Remembering the sunshine in your eyes
Sunbeam you are gone but not forgotten
You I'll carry with me everyday
I'll think about the smile you smiled so often
Until I see you once again someday
You are a sunbeam and you will shine forever
Forever in my heart now that you're gone
You are a sunbeam and you will shine wherever
Wherever your soul decides to roam
I wish you could have stayed a little longer
And shone more of your sunlight in our lives
But having known you I can feel a little stronger
Remembering the sunshine in your eyes
Sunbeam you are gone but not forgotten
You I'll carry with me everyday
I'll think about the smile you smiled so often
Until I see you once again somedayWhat do you say when it's over?
I don't know if I should say anything at all
One day we're rollin' in the clover
Next thing, you know, we take the fall
Still, I think about the years since I first met you
And the way it might have been without you here
I don't know if words from me can still upset you
But I've just gotta make this memory stand clear
I know I'm leavin' here a better man
For knowin' you this way
Things I couldn't do before now I think I can
And I'm leavin' here a better man
I guess, I always knew I couldn't hold you
But I'd never be the one to set you free
Just like some old nursery rhyme your Mama told you
You still believe in some old, 'Meant to be'
Still, I'm leavin' here a better man
For knowin' you this way
Things I couldn't do before now I think I can
And I'm leavin' here a better man
Yes, I'm leavin' here a better man
For knowin' you this way
Things I couldn't do before now I know I can
And I'm leavin' here a better man
(Ooo ooo ooo)
Yes, I'm leavin' here a better manYou took me out so far that i can't swim to shore
I've been holding on but you're not anymore
Our love would always lead us home
Constant as the northern star
Here's a storm we won't get through cause it's not in your heart
I can feel you drifting slowly out of reach
Out there in the distance, there's something else you need
If i could be what's missing, that's all i'd want to be
I can feel you drifting
In the silence that's become the company we keep
I've realized how far we are from what we used to be
Part of you has gone somewhere i can't seem to touch
I could stay and take what's left, but baby, that's not us
I can feel you drifting slowly out of reach
Out there in the distance, there's something else you need
If i could be what's missing, that's all i'd want to be
I can feel you driftingAn introduction to the other side of you
Oh yes I'm finding out some things I never knew
Now all at once it seems you are a stranger
If I've been introduced to the other side of you
Tonight I overheard a conversation by the ones who know the secret side of you
The things they said that you and her were doing
Makes it seem you're a man I'd never knew
An introduction to the other side of you...
[ steel ]
As I listened to the ones who know you better
And the things they said about you hurt me bad
I told myself that they could be mistaken
But still I can't forget the the things they said
An introduction to the other side of you...Down at the railroad station my suitcase settin' by my side
Got no high hopes of leaving I'm just watching the trains go by
Watching the trains go by
Lawyer Jabob's wife she is expecting and he wonders why in blazes
How his wife could come to blame now they tried so many times before
Walking back down this dusty farmroad my thirsty mind is high and dry
One more day down at the station watching the trains go by
Down at the railroad station
Papa's working at the coal mines mama's lying sick in bed
They'd be better off without me one less mouth to be fed
Younger brother John is in the jailhouse down on the woodfarm chopping wood
I stayed around and tried to change him don't look like I done no good
Down at the railroad station
Down at the railroad stationIt don't matter to the sun
If you go or if you stay
I know the sun is gonna rise
Shine down on another day
There will still be a tomorrow
Even if you choose to leave
'Cause it don't matter to the sun (oh baby)
It matters to me
It ain't gonna stop the world
If you walk out that door
This old world will just keep on turning 'round (Turning 'round)
Like it did the day before
'Cause see to them it makes no difference (ohh)
It just keeps on keepin' time
'Cause it ain't gonna stop the world (Oh baby)
But it'll be the end of mine
What can I say
What can I do
I'm still in love
So without you...
(GuitarPiano solo)
Mmm mmm mmm, oh yeah, oh yeah
What can I say
What can I do
I'm still in love
So without youIf I drove a truck
And I were a waitress
And I ordered coffee
And I poured you some
Then you stop by one on your way
Some time later
And if we arm-wrestled
I'd say that to won
I hear my baby ride again
Ride high in the saddle all day
If you're lovin' is good
And your cookin' ain't greasy
We'll jump the chuck wagon
And we'll ride away
If I were a winsome
And pale signorita
And I was a bullfighter
If I ran the country
I'd be your first lady
And fix up the White House
While you were away
Waiting while I'm passing time
With world leaders
And later together
Alone we might lay(Dolly Parton)
Let me walk in the sunshine of your smile
Let me hide in the shadows of your eyes
Let me lie in the safety of your arms
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm
I'll keep you warm
Let me be the someone that you need
Let me be the shelter that you seek
Let me be your strength when you are weak
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm
Let me walk in the sunshine of your smile
Let me hide in the shadows of your eyes
Let me lie in the safety of your arms
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm
I'll keep you warm
Let me be the one always around
Let me help you up when you are down
Let me make a smile out of a frown
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm
Let me walk in the sunshine of your smile
Let me hide in the shadows of your eyes
Let me lie in the safety of your arms
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm
I'll keep you warm
Let me be the fire that keeps you warmPrecious memories, unseen angels
Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger, ever near me
And the sacred past unfolds
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness, of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious father, loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appears
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness, of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
I remember Mother praying
Father too, on bended knee
The sun is sinking, shadows falling
But their prayers still follow me
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness, of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious memories fill my soulChristopher Clark, Of Music (ASCAP)
HANKENSTEIN
Midnight in Montgomery
Full moon shining on a shack
Where a country music legend is about to be brought back
Cledus got the idea from the late night creature feature
And figured he would foller a similar procedure
HANKENSTEIN
Now laid out on the table is the body of a man
In a white suit
Cowboy boots
And a guitar in his hand
He's hooked up to a tractor with a set of jumper cables
And if anything could start a cold cold heart a John Deere should be able.
HANKENSTEIN
Now what's about to happen here is nothin' less than shockin
With a record player in the corner blaring Hey Good Lookin'
That foot began to tap along with that old 45
And you can hear old Cledus yelling UH OH ITS ALIVE!!!!!
CHORUS:
HANKENSTEIN
He's a honky-tonkin monster
HANKENSTEIN
He's a honky-tonkin monster
HANKENSTEIN
He's a honky-tonkin monster
HANKENSTEIN
In no time Hankenstein was mo-anin' the blues
And Cledus has decided it's time to spread the news
They'll hit the road and put on shows all over the nation
Yeah, he's gonna be the next country music sensation
HANKENSTEIN
Everyone still loves to hear the tale of old Kawliga
And they all sing and dance when he cuts loose on Jambalaya
Playing on the Opry stage was his final test
Now Hankenstein has become a monster success
CHORUS
Lovesick in a hotel near the Mason Dixon Line
Hankenstein is sitting there so lonesome he could cry
He's had it with the life he leads singing all them tunes
Now he's out there somewhere honky tonkin howlin at the moon
CHORUS
HANKENSTEIN
He's a honky-tonkin monsterIf they shoot me down to shut me down
Who will take my place?
If they bring an army into this town
Who will take my place?
If they rule this land and silence me
When I'm laid out with injury
When my words won't matter anymore
Who will take my place?
Revolution you are not my hope
Who will take my place?
There are flowers painted on these stones
Who will take my place?
When the silence of oppression dies
Overheard beyond the battle cries
Are the words of final compromise.
Who will take my place?
When the dogs of war are on the land
Who will take my place?
When you forfeit life to take a stand
Who will take my place?
When the dreamers fear the simplest thoughts
When the bloodshed takes all that you've got
When this world's an empty creaking floor
Who will take my place?
If they rule this land and silence me
When I'm laid out with injury
When my words won't matter anymore
Who will take my place?
Who will take my place?Baby sweet sweet baby
My world's so cold and empty since you've gone
Baby sweet sweet baby
Without you I don't know how I'll go on
I've got that lonesome feeling deep inside of me
And it just keeps right on hurtin' all the time
I'd forget you if it wasn't for your memory
You're out of sight but you're never out of my mind
Baby sweet sweet baby
I can't help loving you the way I do
Oh baby sweet sweet baby
Please come on back and call me baby too(Dolly Parton)
Walter, Walter Henry
I say Walter Henry Hagan
You done gone and broke my heart
Walter, Walter Henry
You know that I believed you
When you swore we'd never part
Well you said you had to have me
And well you dang well did
You took me from my country home
When I was just a kid
And you took me off to Boston
Put a baby on my knee
Left me to dangle-dingle
So far from Tennessee
Now Patrick might have been one
But you ain't been no saint
But a good ole' Irish boy
They say we'll always have this drink
And you just won't stop chasin'
All those other woman around
A' ramblin' and a'gamblin'
Throwin' Irish whiskey down
Walter, Walter Henry
Walter Henry Hagan
You don't listen when I call
Walter, Walter Henry
Of all the men I've ever loved
I loved you best of all
Oh play one for ol' Walter Henry boys
Walter, Walter Henry
Walter Henry Hagan
You done left your mark on me
Walter, Walter Henry
If you ever sober up
I'm waitin' back in Tennessee
If you ever sober up
I'm waitin' back in Tennessee
Walter, Walter Henry
Yoddle-le-ee-hee
Yoddle-le-ee-hee
Walter Henry Hagan
You done left your mark on me(Bruce Springsteen)
You make up your mind, you choose the chance you take
You ride to where the highway ends and the desert breaks
Out on through an open road you ride until the day
You learn to sleep at night with the price you pay
Now with their hands held high, they reached out for the open skies
And then with their last breath
They built the roads they would ride to their deaths
Driving on through the night unable to break away
>From the restless pull of the price you pay
Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay
Now they've come so far and they've waited so long
Just to end up caught in a dream where everything goes wrong
Where the dark of night holds back the light of the day
And you gotta stand and fight for the price you pay
Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay
Little girl down on the strand
With that pretty little baby in your hands
Do you remember the story of the Promised land
How he crossed the desert sands
And could not enter the Chosen Land
On the banks of the river he stayed
To face the price you pay
So let the games start
You better run you little wild heart
You can run through all the nights and all the days
But just across the county line
A stranger passin' through put up a sign
That counts so many fallen away
To the price you pay,
Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay
Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay
Now you can't walk away from the price you payRun along blues don't you bother me run along blues let me be
Well you're all the time weighin' on my mind
You won't let me be run along blues don't you worry me
Just let me alone now let me pretend
That she's still mine now she's not just a friend
Run along blues don't you start the pain I'll hurt tomorrow if it's all the same
I know you'll be back I'm in misery run along blues don't you bother me
Just let me alone now let me pretendLove me high, love me low
Love me till I don't know which way to go
That's what you do to me
Whoa, that's what you do to me
Love me wrong, love me right
Got me long before you offer the night
That's what you do to me
Whoa, that's what you do to me
Your love is like a river an' somewhere in the middle
We're caught between your heart an' your hand
Each time I think it's real, it's such a helpless feelin'
With you I never know where I stand
Just a touch takes my desire
From your fryin' pan right into your fire
That's what you do to me
Whoa, that's what you do to me
Your love is like a river an' somewhere in the middle
We're caught between your heart an' your hand
Each time I think it's real, it's such a helpless feelin'
With you I never know where I stand
Just a touch takes my desire
From your fryin' pan right into your fire
That's what you do to me
Whoa, that's what you do to me
That's what you do to me
Whoa, that's what you do to me
That's what you do to me
Whoa, that's what you do to meI saw the picture in Sunday's paper of a honeymoon in old Mexico
There my sweet Judy was smiling sweetly in the arms of my best friend Joe
Sweet sweet Judy I want you happy even though I miss you so
Adios husta luego God be with you wherever you go
I'll never hear the church bells ringing I'll never have a honeymoon
And when they find me they'll understand I left this world by my own hand
Sweet sweet Judy I want you happyHis life is that blue bike
Ball glove and fishing pole
Tree house, BB Gun, and Band-Aid covered knees
He does good delivering papers
And cuttin' grass for the neighbors
Except for Widow Wilson; he cuts hers for free
His little hands do a lot for a kid his age
He puts one tenth of his hard earned money
In the offering plate each Sunday by his own choice
There's a lot of man in that little boy
Weekdays he tries to sleep late
Weekends he's up at day break
Him and Roy wadin' in Cotton Creek
That dog was like his brother
You see one, you see the other
Cut one, and both of them would bleed
Tires screamed, but that old truck couldn't stop
There's the tree that he buried him under
He made a cross from scraps of lumber
And on it carved 'God Bless Old Roy'
There's a lot of man in that little boyWe couldn't call it love cause it really wasn't love anymore
Yet we couldn't call it hate cause there's no way to hate
Someone you've loved so much before
We couldn't call it livin' cause it wasn't still alive
We couldn't call it dead cause it refused to die
We ran out of anything to call it so we called it quits
Quits quits we called it quits it sounds like the easy way out but oh when it hits
The longer you live with someone you can't live with the harder it gets
We called it magic then we called it tragic finally we called it quits
It's always been harder to fall out of love than fall in
I don't know where I'm goin' but I doubt if I'll ever forget where I've been
We couldn't call it happy though it was for a while
We couldn't call it sad cause it taught us both to smile
For luck for a better word to call it we called it quits
Quits quits we called it quits it sounds like the easy way out but oh when it hitsI'll live every day for you, I'd breathe every breath for you
So if I'm mean and make you blue, it's my way of loving you
If I say that you're untrue and it breaks your heart in two
I can't help these things I do, it's my way of loving you
Try to understand my love, look into my heart
Can't you see I'd want to die if we ever part
All my life I've loved you so though at times it may not show
That my love for you is true, it's my way of loving you
(It's my way of loving you)Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, are you married?
We'll say, no man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's Charlie Brown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until all the other children knock him down.
When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Walking in a winter wonderlandAlmost out of gas and darn I wish I would've asked him
If he's gonna be home late again tonight
Gotta turn these movies in, I swear I'm nearin' my wit's end
And Jen your dad said, "No, I'm sorry but that's life"
Thinkin' three things at one time
That's what's going on in the mind of this woman
I need to lose ten pounds
Feel like I'm going 'round and 'round in circles
Someone stop this world and let me off
Think I'll call my best friend Sue
Hello, hey girl, what's new with you?
Well, I swear if it were me I'd tell him off
Thinkin' three things at one time
That's what's going on in the mind of this woman
Sometimes I wonder if I'm coming or I'm going, have to stop
Catch my breath, step back and look at where I am
I love my life one minute then I hate like hell I'm in it
But I don't expect myself to understand
Think I'll stop and wash the car, grab some lunch and kill an hour
'Cause I gotta pick the kids up after school
Then I drift off to the last time we made love, oh, it was so fine
There's that laundry list at home I gotta do
Thinkin' three things at one time
That's what's going on in the mind of this woman
Thinkin' three things at one time
That's what's going on in the mind of this woman
Of this womanI've walked the straight and narrow and I've worn a rebel's brand
Sometimes I've had to go without for bein' my own man
I've rallied to the cause when I knew the cause was right
I've cut against the grain, but I've kept my peace of mind
And I wouldn't have it any other way
If there's a price for bein' me, that's one I'll have to pay
I'll take the good and bear the bad until my dyin' day
I wouldn't have it any other way
Oh, I wouldn't have it any other way
I could have taken a beaten path every time trouble starts
I'd rather take a beatin' than to ever cross my heart
Stickin' to my guns, can't be sold or bought
Holdin' to my honor no matter what the cost
And I wouldn't have it any other way
If there's a price for bein' me, that's one I'll have to pay
I'll take the good and bear the bad until my dyin' day
I wouldn't have it any other way
Oh, I wouldn't have it any other way
I wouldn't have it any other wayI'll share my world with you everything that I own
My earthly possessions there's no good if I'm alone
Let me bring you the sunshine when it's fresh with morning dew
Can't you see that I'm waiting to share my world with you
I'll share my world with you if you'll be mine alone
I'll give you a new heart you're the only love it's known
Let me give you my two arms they'll be happy if you do
Can't you see they are waiting to share my world with you
[ steel ]
I'll share my world with you everything that we'll see
Divide all the memories one for you and one for me
Let me give you my two lips they'll be smilin' if you do
Can't you see they are waiting to share my world with youI take the chance to lose my soul my life my pride I take the chance to be with you
I know it's wrong for us to steal a kiss
But when you hold me in your arms oh I can't resist
I have a home and someone kind and true I know I'd lose it all if I was seen with you
I take the chance to lose my soul my life my pride I take the chance to be with you
I've tried to live my life the best I can
I've prayed I'd never cheat to heed my heart's command
But dear you know to one I've been untrue
I wonder if you think I'd do the same to you
I take the chance to lose my soul my life my pride I take the chance to be with youOld Red was one of the orneriest yet
I'd seen at the big rodeo
He'd bite you and kick you and stomp out your life
Old Red had never been rode
Meaner than sin, wild as the wind
That blew on the Montana plains
Old Red was one of the last of his breed
And wasn't about to be tamed
From Idaho a young cowboy came
To ride in the big rodeo
The young cowboy's name was Billy McClain
And Billy had never been thrown
The greatest desire filled young Billy's heart
To ride this old outlaw called Red
He drew him one day and I heard Billy say
"I'll ride him or drop over dead"
Old Red was wicked down there in the chute
He was kickin' and stompin' about
Billy dropped into the saddle with ease
And said, "Turn him loose let us out"
Old Red came out with his head on the ground
His back hooves were touching his nose
Tryin' to get rid of the man of his back
But the man went wherever he'd go
Billy was rakin' old Red with his spurs
From his tail to the tip of his chin
He was doin' right well but Billy could tell
This outlaw would never give in
Old Red was bucking straight for the fence
Suddenly stopped in and then
He reared on his hind legs then fell on his back
Taking poor Billy with him
There was a hush in the crowd
For they knew this would be Billy's last ride
The saddle horn crushed Billy's chest
When they fell and under old Red Billy died
Old Red lay still no more would he move
The cowboys that seen it could tell
In tryin' to throw Billy off of his back
Old Red broke his neck when he fell
Out in the west is the place where they rest
This cowboy that never was thrown
And one foot away resting there neath the clay
Is the outlaw that never was rodeMy father had so much to tell me things he said I had to know
Don't make my mistakes there are rules you can't break
But I had to find out on my own
Now when I look at my own sons I see what my father went through
There's only so much you can do
You're proud when they walk scared when they run
That's how it always has been between fathers and sons
It's a bridge you can't cross it's a cross you can't bear
It's the words you can't say the things you can't change
No matter how much you care
So you do all you can then you gotta let go
You're just part of the flow of the river that runs between fathers and sons
Now your mother she'll try to protect you she'll hold you as long as she can
But the higher you climb the more you can see
And that's something I understand
One day you'll look at your own son there'll be so much that you want to say
But he'll have to find his own way
Down the road he must take the course he must run
That's how it always has been between fathers and sons
It's a bridge you can't cross
We're just part of the flow of the river that runs between fathers and sonsDont call my name out your window, Im leavin'
I wont even turn my head.
Dont sent your kinfolk to give me no talkin'
Ill be gone, like I said.
Youd just say the same old things
That you be sayin'all along,
Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut,
Till Im gone.
Dont give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan
Understand your man.
Now, you can give my other suit to the Salvation Army,
And everything else I leave behind
I aint takin'nothin'thatll slow down my travelinof your bad-mouthin'
Understand your man.Just another bar
With loud guitars
Smoke and candles burning low
And the same ol' boys
Their backs to the bar
Staring across a crowded floor
Then I hear a familiar sound
Your voice laughing out loud
From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance
So I take a chair
In a corner somewhere
You can't see me
But I can look at you
And I remember those times
When I looked in your eyes
The way that he now looks at you
Deep down I know it's over
But it hurts me when he's so much closer
From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance
And if I can't hold you near me
I'll just hold onto your memory
From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance
I'll always love you from a distanceI can't answer her letter
For she left me no address
You should know, my little darling
You left my poor heart in distress
I got a letter from my darling
She said she hated to go
It broke my heart, the words she wrote me
She closed by saying I love you so
She wrote the words she knew would hurt me
She said I never could be true
I've tried, I've tried, my little darling
To prove my love was just for you
I got a letter from my darling
She said she hated to go
It broke my heart, the words she wrote me
She closed by saying I love you so
The letter meant goodbye forever
Though we'll have each other's hearts
Our love will fade away in sadness
Precious one, why did we have to part?
I got a letter from my darling
She said she hated to go
It broke my heart, the words she wrote me
She closed by saying I love you soI found your letter in my mailbox today
You were just checkin' if I was okay
And if I still miss you
Well you know what they say
Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
And I feel one comin' on soon
No need to tell me you'd like to be friends
And help me get back on my feet again
And do I still miss you?
Well it's just now and then
Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
And I feel one comin' on soon
There's a blue moon shinin'
When I'm reminded
Of all we've been through
Such a blue moon shinin'
Does it ever shine down on you?
Oh, 'cause you act like
It never even hurt you at all
And I'm the only one
Gettin' up from a fall
Tell me you don't feel it
Oh can't you recall
Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
And I feel one comin' on soonYou showed me how to do exactly what to do
How I fell in love with you
Oh oh oh it's true
Oh oh I love you
You showed how to say exactly what to say
In that very special way
Oh oh oh it's true
You fell for me too
And when I tried it
I could see you fall
And I've decided
It's not a trick at all
You taught it to me too exactly what you do
And now you love me too
Oh oh oh it's true
We're in love we two
And when I tried it
I could see you fall
And I've decided
It's not a trick at all
You taught it to me too exactly what you do
And now you love me too
Oh oh it's true
We're in love we tooBig wind big wind's comin'
From daylight till dusk we've been a workin' in the dust
Pickin' cotton workin' side by side
Oh I can't forget I still remember yet the way my daddy looked at me and cried
Big wind's a comin' listen to the hummin' hurry up now be quick don't stall
You know we can't be slow take the kids and get below
If we don't hurry it'll surely get us all
I ran across the field so scared my lips was scaled
To warn my mom to storm was on its way
Now I knew I'd won the race when I'd see my mama's face
And the way she looked at me and said
Big wind's a comin'
Oh but dad was on the cellar and by now the sky was yellow
The wind was blowin' trees were fallin'
And outside I heard him cryin' and as he lay there dyin'
It seemed I could still hear him sayin'
Big wind's a comin'
Big wind big wind's comin'All the labor landed in the sod
Where the digger cried it's my calling, sir
And it is no mistake that I put you in the ground so well
And if they pay me well thats great
It's just gravy I'd do it anyway
All the labor stood up and shouted I'll wait for you fun lovin' minever cheevy
With all yer drunken dellusions I am a sensational place
Of comeraderie and pleasure won't you stand with me in your garden once more
All the labor although it be brick on brick
Stitch on stitch and earn to urn
A presence on the lift what this great ole nation was built on boy
Outlives the package everyday mama mama everydayThe day I met you my heart spoke to me it said to love you through eternity
Not knowing that you were another's bride I vowed I'd always be close by your side
You know I love you and I always will I know you're married but I love you still
[ fiddle ]
You broke a heart dear that would die for you I'd give the world to belong to you
The game is over now I know I've lost my broken heart will have to pay the cost
You know I love you and I always will I know you're married but I love you stillOnce upon a time you and I were so in love
The whole wide world was gay and happy then
I don't know how or why our love began to die till it vanished like a straw in the wind
We're side by side but we're lonely together clinging to the pieces of a vow
Everybody used to say we were perfect together but we're lonely together now
[ guitar - steel ]
It's a mighty big roof that we've nailed upon our house
For it stretches from your world to mine
It keeps out the rain but it can't keep out the pain
And the tears that I see falling all the time
We're side by side...
Oh we're lonely together nowWouldn't take long for the rivers 'round here to rise
Wouldn't take long for the rivers 'round here to rise
Wouldn't take long for the rivers to rise
There wouldn't be nothing but the sea and the sky
Wouldn't take long for the rivers 'round here to rise
Forty days and forty nights
Forty days and forty nights
Forty days and forty nights
Forty days and forty nights
Forty days and nights of rain and we would start all over again
In just forty days and forty nights of rain
The wind and rain will not knock upon your door
The wind and rain will not knock upon your door
The wind and rain, they came before anybody knew what
a door was for
The wind and rain will not knock upon the door
Forty days and forty nights
Forty days and forty nights
Forty days and forty nights
Forty days and forty nights
Forty days and nights of rain and we would start all over again
In just forty days and forty nights of rain
Cities they are built and then they're broken
Nothing lasts forever, so they say
We all know how long it took to build this
But how long would it take now just to wash it all away
These fools believe that they can control the tide
These fools believe that they can turn the tide
No one turns the tide and everybody swims when the waters rise
These fools believe that they can turn the tide
Forty days and forty nights
Forty days and forty nights
Forty days and forty nights
Forty days and forty nights
Forty days and nights of rain and we would start all over again
In just forty days and forty nights of rainCAN'T CONTROL THE WIND

RECORDED BY RICKY SKAGGS
When I was a boy daddy was my guiding light
We'd take walks and talk about fishing girls and life
He'd help me with my homework cheer me up when I was down
Best friend that I ever had I miss havin' him around
He'd say do the very best you can with all that you've been blessed
And if the load's too great for you the Lord will do the rest
Keep one thing in mind if all else should fail
You can't control the wind but you can adjust the sail
Daddy lost his job when the factory closed
Times were hard bills to pay he was troubled and it showed
But he said son don't worry it's all to no avail
We can't control the wind but we can adjust the sail
I think of his advice when life turns its back on me
There is no mountain I can't climb if I start down on my knees
I'll do the very best I can with all that I've been blessed
And if the load's too great for me the Lord will do the rest
I'll keep one thing in mind if all else should fail
I can't control the wind but I can adjust the sail
No I can't control the wind but I can adjust the sailWhen I see myself I'm seeing you too
As long as I remember and I'm feeling like I knew
That my jokes aren't funny the truth isn't true
If there was no you
If you were my boat in the deep blue sea
I probably sink you down
I know I should have thanked you for carrying me
But for you I would happily drown
Out on your way the darkest night the longest day
I know what to say to make you laugh
And nothing you could do
Could make me turn my back on you
When you're looking for a fight I'm your man
When you need a friend you got my hand
And what I really mean what IÃÂ¢??m trying hard to say
Is that I'm counting on you and you got me too
Our secrets aren't safe I'm singing out of tune
If there was no you if there was no youHey daddy I need a drink of water those are the sounds I'm living by
Not long ago my ears thought they were happy
When a jukebox in a bar was turned up high
But drinking there no children call me daddy now these are the sounds I'm living by
Hey daddy can we watch the movie hey daddy can I go outside
Hey daddy sister lost her broodie those are the sounds I'm living by
So now the bars and blonds are bitter history I wanna hear my babies when they cry
And why I left them once is still a mystery I almost lost the sounds I'm living by
Hey daddy you know that I love you hey daddy what's there in your eye
Yes daddy's crying but I'm happy for these are the sounds I'm living byYou are my special angel sent from up above
The Lord smiled down on me and sent an angel to love
You are my special angel right from paradise
I know that you're an angel cause heaven is in your eyes
The smile from your lips brings the summer sunshine
The tears from your eyes bring the rain
I feel your touch your warm embrace and I'm in heaven again
You are my special angel through eternity
I'll have my special angel here to watch over me
You are my special angel...Saw you turnin' down main street
In your big, black fancy car
You were dressed up fit to kill
With a pretty girl on your arm
You spun around and you headed up town
Where the neon lights all shine
Left me choking in a cloud of dust
You never pay me no mind
Chorus:
You're livin' in the fast lane
I guess I'm just too slow
I never wore silk or fancy furs
Just plain ole calico
I'll never be a fast lane lover
And they're the only kind you take up town
I am just a country road
That you keep turnin' down
If you ever hit a dead end street
If it's love that you're looking for
You can always turn around
And beat a path right to my door
Do I have to draw you a map
You seem to know your way around
So when you're tired of spinnin' your wheels
Baby, we can go to town
Repeat Chorus
I'll never be a fast lane lover
And they're the only kind you take up town
I am just a country road
That you keep turnin' down
I am just a country road
That you keep turnin' down
Repeat ChorusI met her out in Oklahoma down where the old Red River flows
I vowed my love to her forever she was my sweet sweet Rosie Jones
We walked alone down by the river just as the sun was sinking low
And in her eyes I saw big trouble like the muddy waters down below
Her lips were soft and sweet as honey her hair was bright as yellow as gold
Her cheeks were red as summer roses she was my sweet sweet Rosie Jones
And then one day a tall dark stranger with hair as black as winter coal
Rode into town as night was falling and there he met my Rosie Jones
I woke next morning just after sunup to find a note from my Rosie's hand
And it read I'd rather die than ever hurt you but I'm in love with that tall dark man
So now I walk alone down by the river where my sweet Rosie used to stroll
And soon I'm gonna join those deep dark waters for I can't live without Rosie Jones
Her lips were soft...I'm a high wire act, without a net
I'm a tips all in on a losing bet
I"m a minor cord on an old guitar
I'm one too many in a crowded bar
Don't you wanna fall
Don't you wanna fall
Fall down here where an angel should know better than
To walk around this world with me
All the girls love to talk about forever
From way up here the talk is always cheap
Don't you wanna fall
Don't you wanna fall
You're that first good buzz at seventeen
You're the good guy winning on the movie screen
You're a candle burning in the church in Rome
You're a first class ticket on the last plane home
But don't you wanna fall
Don't you wanna fall
Fall down here where an angel should know better than
To walk around this world with me
All the girls love to talk about forever
From way up there the talk is always cheap
Don't you wanna fall
Don't you wanna fallThere was no moon that night,
But the light in your eyes,
Pulled at my heart and turned the tide;
I was carried away.
Now all I do is pray,
That someday you'll stay right by my side.
But it's out of my hands;
I have no control
Of where love will lead us, on this winding road.
But if I had my way,
I'd be your man,
I'd give all I have and all I can.
So I'm letting go,
'Cause inside I know
It's out of my hands.
In the past I'd hold on,
Thinkin' I was so strong,
Only to find I was so wrong.
There ain't a thing I can do
To make you feel this way too,
But somehow my heart will carry on.
'Cause it's out of my hands;
I have no control
Of where love will lead us, on this winding road.
But if I had my way,
I'd be your man,
I'd give all I have and all I can.
So I'm letting go,
'Cause inside I know
It's out of my hands.
Maybe this mystery
Will never be clear to me.
It's out of my hands;
I have no control
Of where love will lead us, on this winding road.
But if I had my way,
I'd be your man,
I'd give all I have and all I can.
So I'm letting go,
'Cause inside I know
It's out of my hands.
So I'm letting go,
'Cause inside I know
It's out of my hands.Oh, when the evening sun goes down
You will find me hanging 'round
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life
Many people just like me
Dreaming of old used-to-be
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life
Well, listen to the blues they're playin'
Yeah, listen to what the blues are sayin'
Mine is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life
Well, listen to the blues they're playin'
Yeah, listen to what the blues are sayin'
Mine is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams
Oh, the night life ain't no good life
But it's my lifeA 1986 Harley
Blowin' smoke and suckin' oil
My daddy said, "Buy it and you're crazy, boy"
Can't tell me nothin'
It took two months to fix it up
And one day to lay her down
I got a little hitch in my get-along now
Can't tell me nothin'
Talk is cheap and free advice
Is worth the price you pay
I had to find out for myself the hard way
Can't tell me nothin'
Hometown homecoming sweetheart
Nobody thought I had a prayer
Her mama said, "Boy, don't you come around here"
Can't tell me nothin'
They say be careful what you wish for
I wanted to be her man
Now two babies and a trailer later, here I am
Can't tell me nothin'
Talk is cheap and free advice
Is worth the price you pay
I had to find out for myself the hard way
Can't tell me nothin'
They say that drinkin'll kill you
The same thing for rollin' smoke
That's two of the three things I like most
Can't tell me nothin'
I know what the Good Book preaches
But I know how I am
I sure hope somebody up there understands
Can't tell me nothin'
Can't tell me nothin'Don't count the diamonds in her wedding band until she wears it on her hand
I once believed in all she told me my faithful bride she was to be
But then a thief walked in between us and stole her love away from me
Don't count the diamonds in her wedding band until she wears it on her hand
Don't count the diamonds in her wedding band until she wears it on her hand
My heart has finally learned this lesson to never love just anyone
You can't believe on someone's promise until the promise has been done
So don't count the diamonds in her wedding band until she wears it on her handGod's gonna get 'cha for that
God's gonna get 'cha for that
There's no place to run and hide
For He knows where you're at
God's gonna get 'cha for that
God's gonna get 'cha for that
Every wrong thing that you do
God's gonna get 'cha for that
This doggone world we're living in
It's giving me a fit
It seems like everywhere I turn
I see a hypocrite
Well, if ya wanna go to heaven
Well, you can't live like that
So let me tell you, brother
God's gonna get 'cha for that
God's gonna get 'cha for that, yeah
God's gonna get 'cha for that
There's no place to run and hide
For He knows where you're at
God's gonna get 'cha for that, yeah
God's gonna get 'cha for that
Every wrong thing that you do
God's gonna get 'cha for that
Now, the preacher in our church
He's a mighty devoted man
Everybody thinks, that he's a-goin'
To the promised land
But the other night on a country road
While I was a-drivin' through
I caught the preacher makin' love
To Sister Mary Lou
God's gonna get 'cha for that, yeah
God's gonna get 'cha for that
There's no place to run an' hide
For He knows where you're at
God's gonna get 'cha for that, yeah
God's gonna get 'cha for that
Every wrong thing that you do
God's gonna get 'cha for that
Now ol' Sister Bessie
She like to testify
She says, 'I'll always love the Lord
Someday I'm a-gonna fly
But the other night while goin' by
The local liquor store
I caught ol' Sister Bessie
Flyin' out the door
God's gonna get 'cha for that
God's gonna get 'cha for that
There's no place to run and hide
For He knows where you're at
God's gonna get 'cha for that
God's gonna get 'cha for that
Every wrong thing that you do

There's no place to run and hide
For He knows where you're atNow come and listen to my story
A story that I know is true
A little rose that bloomed in Georgia
With hair of gold and a heart so true
Way down in the blue ridge mountains
Way down where the tall pines grow
Lives my sweetheart of the mountains
She's my little Georgia rose
Her mother left her with another
A carefree life she had planned
The baby now she is a lady
The one her mother couldn't stand
We often sing those songs together
I watched her do her little part
She smiled at me when I would tell her
That she was my sweetheartI'm the son of a 3rd generation farmer
I've been married 10 years to the farmer's daughter
I'm a God fearin' hard workin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road on my p-p-p-p-plower
Chug a lug a luggin' 5 miles an hour
On my International Harvester
Three miles of cars layin' on their horns
Fallin' on deaf ears of corn
Lined up behind me like a big parade
Of late to work road raged jerks
Shoutin' obscene words flippin' me the bird
Well you may be on a state paved road
But that blacktop runs through my payload
Excuse me for tryin' to do my job
But this year ain't been no bumper crop
If you don't like the way I'm a drivin'
Get back on the interstate
Otherwise sit tight and be nice
And quit yer honkin' at me that way
Cause I'm a son of a 3rd generation farmer
I've been married 10 years to a farmer's daughter
I got 2 boys in the county 4-H
I'm a lifetime sponsor of the F.F.A.
Hay! That's what I make
I make a lotta hay for a little pay
But I'm proud to say
I'm a God fearin' hard workin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road on my a p-p-p-plower
Chug a lug a lugin' 5 miles an hour
On my International Harvester
Well I know you got your own deadlines
But cussin' me ain't savin' no time hoss
This big-wheeled wide load ain't goin' any faster
So just smile and wave and tip your hat
To the man up on the tractor
Cause I'm a son of a 3rd generation farmer
I've been married 10 years to a farmer's daughter
I got two boys in the county 4-H
I'm a lifetime sponsor of the F.F.A.
Hay! That's what I make
I make a lot of hay for a little pay
But I'm proud to say
I'm a God fearin' hard workin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road on my p-p-p-plower
Chug a lug a lugin' 5 miles an hour
On my International Harvester
I'm a God fearin' hard workin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road on my p-p-p-plower
Chug a lug a lugin' 5 miles an hour
On my International HarvesterNot too long ago you said to me
I believe it's time you set me free
'Cause I found a woman who knows how to love me right
And she don't mind if I lay out all night
And you said hallelujah this woman sure gets to ya
I fin'lly found peace of mind
A singing hallelujah you don't know what good it'll do ya
Playin' around with love'll do it everytime
But then one day she felt like movin' on
One goodbye and you were all alone
And it's funny but I could almost hear the sound
When your whole world came tumblin' to the ground
And I said hallelujah that woman socked it to ya
Just walked away and blew your mind
A singing hallelujah you've got what's comin' ya
Playin' around with love'll do it everytimeOnce I lived a life of wine and roses and I drank a lot back then for one concern
Success for me lay just around the corner
I thought my social friends would help me make me turn
But now I'm paying for the days of wine and roses a victim of the drunken life I chose
Now all my social friends look down their noses
'Cause I kept the wine and threw away the rose
I stood by and watched the bottle take control of me
The turn I made was not the one I'd planned
And I watched my social standings slip away from me
While I watched the bottle slowly take command
But now I'm paying for...I'm skipping across the stars
Hopping from moon to moon
Higher than a kite's been before
Made my way to Mars
Venus and Neptune
If I was scared of heights
I ain't no more
Up this high in outerspace
Old cloud nine looks commonplace
Floating way down there in the blue
Up this high at heaven's door
Worlds collide and comets soar
Your love lets me fly up this high
A lot of astronauts have left the planet earth
But they use rocketships to kiss the sky
I don't have what they got
But I sail the universe
Everytime your lips are kissing mine
Up this high in outerspace
Old cloud nine looks commonplace
Floating way down there in the blue
Up this high at heaven's door
Worlds collide and comets soar
Your love lets me fly up this high
Back when I was green
You could find me chooglin' smoke
But when I got off I never left the ground
Now you can't find me
Unless you have a telescope
And I don't want to ever come back down
Up this high in outerspace
Old cloud nine looks commonplace
Floating way down there in the blue
Up this high at heaven's door
Worlds collide and comets soar
Your love lets me fly up this high
I'm highI had a most distressing dream last night
I dreamed I was a crystal bird
Caught in perpetual flight
I'd ascend and glide and descend and ride
On the wind and never alight
I had a most distressing dream last night
Glass enclosed, exposed wherever I flew
With no control and a crystal soul
That one could see right through
No ethereal nest where I could rest
I was frightened by what I knew
That my two crystal legs were broken in two
When I awoke my heart was beating fast
As if all night and endless flight
An eternity had passed
As I shook my head and slipped from my bed
Released from the prism, at last
I stepped upon a bit of shattered glassI thought, I saw a man brought to life
He was warm, he came around and he was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry
Well, you couldn't be that man I adored
You don't seem to know
Seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know him anymore
There's nothing where he used to lie
The conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn
So I guess the fortune teller's right
Should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
It crawled beneath my veins
And now I don't care, I had no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can touch, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn, torn
There's nothing where he used to lie
My inspiration has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's right
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on this floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I'm ashamed
Bound and broken on the floor
You're a little late, I'm already torn, tornI don't want you to cry cause I'm leavin' don't want you to cry cause I'm blue
Only my thoughts make me lonesome wonder if you're lonesome too
Wonder if you're lonesome too
[ fiddle - dobro ]
Why should two lovers quarrel why should they be so untrue
I know what it means to be lonesome wonder if you're lonesome too
Wonder if you're lonesome too
How would you like be lonesome when someone is through with you
My heart is sad and lonesome wonder if you're lonesome too
Wonder if you're lonesome too
[ banjo - harmonica ]
Now give me your right hand honey I'll say this prayer with you
I'll be so lonesome without you will you be lonesome too
Will you be lonesome too
How would you like be lonesome...Oh you're the number one heel in the country
You're the top of the list it's plain to see
And I'm the number one fool that still loves you
Yes you'll always be number one with me
I gave you my love with no reservation your every wish with my every command
I built dreams of our future together my broken heart wasn't part of my plan
Oh you're the number one heel
You make such beautiful speeches and the pictures you painted seemed real
Crazy me I had no way of knowing that you'd turn out to be such a heel
Oh you're the number one heel
Yes you'll always be number one with meYou were the first thing that I thought of
When I thought I drank you off my mind
When I get lost in the liquor
You're the only one I find
And if I did the things I oughta
You still would not be mine
So I'll keep a tight grip on the bottle
Gettin' loose and killin' time
[Chorus:]
This killin' time is killin' me
Drinking myself blind thinkin' I won't see
That if I cross that line and they bury me
I just might find I'll be killin' time for eternity
I don't know nothin' 'bout tomorrow
I've been lost in yesterday
I've spent all my life just dying
For a love that passed away
And if there's an end to all my sorrow
And this is the only price I'll pay
I'll be a happy man when I go
And I can't wait another day
[Chorus]I phoned her today, an accidental mistake
And her name slipped out to some friend
Forgotten old feelin's brand new today'
'Cause I'm right back where I've always been
She's just an old love turned memory
And now I seldom see her around
She's just an old love turned memory
But she still turns my world upside down
I went to some places where I knew she'd be
Just to prove love was over and done
But the moment her eyes touched mine I knew
My sorrow had only begun
She's just an old love turned memory
And now I seldom see her around
She's just an old love turned memory
But she still turns my world upside down(Bruce Springsteen)
Well it's Saturday night
You're all dressed up and blue
I've been watchin' you go out
Maybe you been watchin' me too
So somebody ran out
Left somebody's heart in a mess
Well if you're lookin' for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest
Some girls they want a handsome Dan
Or some good-lookin' Joe
On their arms some girls want
A sweet talkin' Romeo
We'll 'round here baby
I've learned you get what you can get
So if you're rough enough for love
Honey, I'm tougher than the rest
Yeah, the road is dark
And it's a thin, thin line
But I want you to know
I'll walk it for you anytime
Maybe your other girlfriends
Couldn't pass the test
Well if you're rough and ready for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest[I got the blue marlin blues]
First one off the dock, long before dawn
Headed to the blue water, won't take long
A box full of ballyhoo, rigged just right
Still hurtin' from that party last night
Thirty miles later, get the call lines in
Scramble' round the cockpit thinkin' we're gonna win
Seven hours later, we still ain't caught a thing
Mood on this boat sure has changed
[Chorus]
I got the blue marlin blues
From my hat to my shoes
I used to catch 'em in twos
No matter which bait I choose
How many more can I lost
They got me drinkin' the booze
I got the blue marlin blues
I had one swimmin' right behind my bait
All lit up man, I just couldn't wait
I picked up the rod
I put it in free spool
Thinkin' I'll shake these blue marlin blues
He knocked it out of the clip
And I fed him some line
I locked it up and I began to wind
He came out of the water
Spit the bait right at me
And disappeared back into the seaPeople steal they cheat and lie
For wealth and what it will buy
But don't they know on the Judgement Day
That gold and silver will melt away.
I'd rather be in a deep dark grave
And know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul.
What good is gold and silver too
If your heart's not pure and true
Sinner hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray.
I'd rather be in a deep dark grave
And know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soulGot you cranked up loud, getting pumped up for the night
But when we pull in her drive gonna turn you down quiet
I'll have one arm around her, one on the wheel
Hey radio, let's make a deal
I'll do the driving, you get us going
Play us a summer song that she knows and
I'll find a spot, I'll pull it over
You slow it down and I'll pull her closer
I'll find the moon and you bring the backbeat
You set the mood, we'll dance in the front seat
Hey radio, while you're playing we'll be falling
I'll do the kissin'
You do the talkin'
Let's make it a night that she'll never forget
Put nothing but thinking 'bout love in her head
With nothing but the glow of your light in the dark
Take us home with the one that we call ours
I'll do the driving, you get us going
Play us a summer song that she knows and
I'll find a spot, I'll pull it over
You slow it down and I'll pull her closer
I'll find the moon and you bring the backbeat
You set the mood, we'll dance in the front seat
Hey radio, while you're playing we'll be falling
I'll do the kissin'
You do the talkin'Kick down the walls
Turn back the clock
Put down the keys
Change the locks
Cause looks like theres something more than rain coming down tonight
Unplug the phone
Break the frame
Untie the knot
That held you in your place
Cause it looks like theres something more than rain coming down tonight
Always gonna be some rain
Always gonna be that hard
Always gonna feel the heat
Always gotta be some fire
Always gotta find your way
Always gonna look for home
Always gotta push that rock
Always gonna be alone
Let go the rail
Step on the glass
Say your peace
At last at last
Looks like theres something more than rain coming down tonight
CHORUS
Tear out the stars
Bring on the clouds
Dial it all in
Turn it up loud
Looks like theres something more than rain coming down tonight X2Chorus:
A heartsong melody play like a symphony
The sweetest music I have ever known
A song of joy and pain
The mountain angels sing
A bittersweet refreign of my Smokey Mountain Home, heartsong
Farmer's daughter if you will
And I often wonder still
In memories where I rammbled as a child
Makes me cry and makes me laugh
My reflections on the past
And the family, friends, and faith that shaped my life
Ragged clothes and hand-me-downs
Just enough to go around
But the sweetest things in life are always free
Like the songs the birds would sing
And the sweet new grass of spring
And the sacred blossoms on the dogwood tree
Repeat Chorus
And I recall the thrill and joy
Of a Smokey Mountain boy
I remember my first kiss and my first love
And the songs I'd song and write
And the dreams I'd clutch so tight
And the loved ones that gave me that extra shove
And in that little house 'a prayer
Where I spent many hour
Prassin' God and liftin' up His name
And asking Him to lead and to keep watch over me
As I headed up that rocky road to fame
And now this, Smokey Mountain girl has been all around the world
But it makes no difference just how far I roam
I still cling to that part that is so dear to my heart
My faith in God and memories of home
Repeat ChorusAnytime you're feelin' lonely
Anytime you're feelin' blue
Anytime you feel down hearted
That will prove your love for me is true
[Chorus]
Anytime you're thinkin' 'bout me
That's the time I'll think of you
Anytime you say, you want me back again
That's the time I'll come back home to you
Anytime your world is lonely
And you find true friends are few
Anytime you see a rainbow
That will be a sign, the storm is through
Anytime will be the right time
Anytime at all will do
Anytime you're sure, you want only my love
That's the time, I'll come back home to youmusic and lyrics by Corb Lund
I have sinned so gravely Brother Brigham, Brother Young
I have sinned so gravely Brother Young
That only you can save me Brother Brigham, Brother Young
That only you can save me Brother Young
I have revealed the temples secrets Brother Brigham, Brother Young
The temple garments, oaths and secrets Brother Young
I have apostatized and doubted Brother Brigham, Brother Young
And borne my testimony falsely Brother Young
And I have loved a woman Brother Brigham, Brother Young
A woman in adultery Brother Young
I have also wed a negress Brother Brigham, Brother Young
My fifth wife has some color Brigham Young
I now see that you're a prophet Brother Brigham, Brother Young
A living, breathing prophet Brother Young
And now I believe the revelations Brother Brigham, Brother Young
I now believe your revelations, every one
Even the ones beyond all reason Brother Brigham, Brother Young
Even the ones beyond all reason Brother Young
For you're the Lord's own earthly prophet Brother Brigham, Brother Young
And hes simply testing in our faith o Brigham Young
My only hope for exaltation Brother Brigham, Brother Young
My only chance for exaltation Brother Young
Is to send me o'er the rim of the basin Brother Brigham, Brother Young
The rim of the Salt Lake Basin Brother Young
For water cannot save me Brother Brigham, Brother Young
Baptismal water cannot save me Brigham Young
My sins are just too deep a dye o Brother Brigham, Brother Young
My sins are just too deep a stain o Brother Young
So send Avenging Angels Brother Brigham, Brother Young
Won't you send Destroying Danites Brother Young
To spill my blood upon the earth o Brother Brigham, Brother Young
I beg you spill my blood o Brother Young
And let its smoke ascend to heaven Brother Brigham Brother Young
And let my breast be cut asunder Brother Young
As an offering for my sins, a smoking incense Brother Young
A blood atoning for my sinning Brother YoungI spent my life trying to avoid it
I always said it was wrong for me
A sign of weakness that's how I saw it
And weak was something I didn't want to be
It wasn't love I was running from
I was just afraid to need someone
Now it feels so good to feel
The need to trust somebody and open up my heart
The need to share my secrets down to the deepest part
I can give, I can take,
Now it's okay to say
That sometimes I feel weak
When you're the reason for the need
You had the strength to cry on my shoulder
You weren't ashamed to lean on me
The honesty kept drawing us closer
And I saw how easy reaching out could be
You showed me love's not about control
Holding on to you is how I let go
And it feels so good to feel
The need to trust somebody and open up my heart
The need to share my secrets down to the deepest part
I can give, I can take,
Now it's okay to say
That sometimes I feel weak
When you're the reason forThe phone lights up in the dark, asks where you are and I start driving
Meet me for a drink, just an hour, maybe two, maybe three, baby I'm in
Girl, you can't take your eyes off me
And that first kiss is sweet relief, ain't no one gotta know
Just one more before you go
I don't wanna be a liar
I don't wanna be a fool
I don't wanna be a secret but I will if you want me to
You can leave me in the dark if that's all I get from you
He can be the sun
I'll be the moon
Yeah, he can be the sun, I'll be the moon
The phone lights up in the dark, gotta go, I know, but it still ain't easy
Tomorrow, you'll be waking up beside him, tell him that you love him but you still see me
In my mind when I'm looking at him
And in my eyes it's the obvious elephant in the room
He can't see it, but girl, you do
I don't wanna be a liar
I don't wanna be a fool
I don't wanna be a secret but I will if you want me to
You can leave me in the dark if that's all I get from you
He can be the sun
I'll be the moon
Yeah, he can be the sun, I'll be the moon
The phone lights up in the dark, yes, it's my turn and I start driving
I don't wanna be a liar
I don't wanna be a fool
I don't wanna be a secret but this is something I can't lose
You can leave me in the dark if that's all I get from you
He can be the sun
And I'll be the moon
He can be the sun, I'll be the moon
The phone lights up in the darkEarly Monday morning, til Friday at five
Man I work, work, work but I don't climb, climb, climb
Boss man can shove that overtime up his can
All I want to do is put a drink in my hand
To fill it up, or throw it down
I got a forty hour week worth of trouble to drown
No need to complicate it, I'm a simple man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
Yeah the parking lot is muddy, can't get to the door
I'll take my jacked up drop er' down in 4x4
Chill down a long neck, warm up the band
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
To fill it up, or throw it down
I'm about to tear a new one in this old town
Five, four, three, two, one I'm a rocket man
All you got to do it put a drink in my hand
Make me want to go ouhhh ouh ouhhh, when you dance like that
You got that little tattoo playing peek-a-boo on your back
Yeah if you want to impress me, baby here's my plan
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
Yeah fill it up, or throw it down
When you drive me home, take the long way around
You be my Lois Lane , I'll be your Superman
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
My head Monday morning that alarm clock sings
It goes bang, bang, bang, while it ring, ring, rings
Yeah I'm ready to roll, if you wanna rock again
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
Yeah fill it up, or throw it down
I got a little hungover, still hanging around
Yeah that hair of a dog is howlin' "hey there man"
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
That hair of a dog is howlin' "hey there man"
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
Haaaaouuhhhhh Yeah!!!Ready, Willing And Able
( written by Jess Leary / Jody Alan Sweet )
Blue moon is rising, all hope seems gone
A heart can be lonely only so long
Baby don't worry 'cause somebody cares
Just call out my name and I'll be right there
(Chorus)
If you need a shoulder strong enough to lean on
If you need a hand that fits like a glove
If you need a heart then hold on steady
'Cause I'm ready, willing and able to love
I know you're wary, you've been hurt before
But it's time to move on, girl, and close that old door
Open your heart, wipe those tears from your eyes
You've got my number, don't even think twice
(Repeat chorus)
Now you think it's over, my offer still stands
And if you're still uncertain, I'll say it again
(Repeat chorus)
Yes, I'm ready, willing and able to loveI can't tell you all about her in this song I couldn't if I did my very best
To describe my love for her would take too long so I'm writin' the book to tell the rest
We met and fell in love in Chapter One when I asked her to be mine she said yes
And heaven was ours in days to come you can read the book and know the rest
Day and night I worked to make a living and sometimes she got lonely I guess
Everything to her I was givin' but you'll have to read the book to know the rest
Now we careful on page three-ninety-fourth it was here our love was put to a test
But it was strong enough to make the score
And you'll have to read the book to know the rest
This book may never have an ending our love is just too strong as when we met
You can always turn back to the beginning and read the book again to know the rest
Just read the book again you'll know the restSo you found your Prince Charming was just a dream
There wasn't any Palace and you weren't a Queen
In your faded cotton dresses anyone could see but you're still Cinderella to me
Cinderella Cinderella this is not the way love should be
Cinderella Cinderella won't you let me take you home with me
Our honeymoon may not be a fancy ball
You may not have a maid and butler at your call
But I'll be more than any prince could ever be and you'll be Cinderella to me
Cinderella Cinderella(Blaise Tosti)
Love's a war we all survive, a never ending compromise
We always seem to say we're through, just to say tomorrow
Babe, I'm still in love with you
Every now and then we fight
So very sure we're both right
Saying things we never mean
Just to take them back tomorrow
And admit how wrong we've been
We're through forever 'til tomorrow
That's all we really seem to say
We can't go on with all this sorrow
We've got to find a better way
Many times we would fight and I would leave you
Then I'd find, just how much I really need you, and love you
Oh, oh, candle light, a glass of wine
Can bring back vision to the blind
Making love is sweet revenge
And when the battle's over
We're back in love, and we both winIt's a sin, my darling, how I love you
Because I know our love can never be
It's a sin to keep this memory of you
When silence proves that you've forgotten me
The dream I built for us has tumbled
Each promise broken like my heart
It's a sin, my darling, how I love you
So much in love and yet so far apart
It's a sin to hide behind this heartache
To make believe that I've found someone new
It's a sin to say that I don't miss you
When people know I'm still in love with you
I'm sure you're happy with another
Who shares the love I could not win
Why pretend that I can't live without you
When deep inside I know that it's a sinI've got some mighty tall tales from livin' hard and fast
I'm a walkin,' talkin,' livin,' breathin,' portrait of my past
I've double-crossed the devil, prayed the Lord my soul to keep
Escaped some early graves by the skin of my teeth
All the deepest secrets of my soul the world can plainly see
'Cause everything I've ever done is written all over me
If you just read between the lines of this well-weathered face of mine
Every wrinkle, every scar was a painful work of art
That reminds me of mistakes that I've made
And no story I can tell can tell it quite as well
As these souvenirs that livin's left behind
So take a long, hard look at the cover of this book
And read between the lines
And read between the lines
They might be hard to find on this rigid face of stone
There are pleasant deep impressions that are solid as gold
And I'll be the first to tell you that this ol' boy's been blessed
'Cause even the worst of times have turned out for the best
Like roads on a map they cross a battered stretch of skin
You can trace your way through memory lane to anywhere I've been
If you just read between the lines of this well-weathered face of mine
Every wrinkle, every scar was a painful work of art
That reminds me of mistakes that I've made
And no story I can tell can tell it quite as well
As these souvenirs that livin's left behind
So take a long, hard look at the cover of this book
And read between the lines
And read between the linesI bought this rhinestone suit in California
These boots came all the way from Mexico
This Cadillac ain't nothin' son you ought to see the Greyhound
I bought to take my band from show to show
Seen my face a thousand times on TV and heard me on your local radio
And in your eyes I see the admiration there for me
But son there's something that you ought to know
Well I've got to take a drink to keep from shakin'
Motel rooms ain't nothing like a home
Money can't make love grow any stronger when you leave your woman home alone
She can't raise the children with no daddy
She can't love a man that's always gone
It takes a whole lot more than pride to keep your feelings locked inside
While you sing another pretty country song
(Play it Pete Drake)
[ steel ]
(I've seen your face a thousand times on TV I've heard you on my local radio)
It's true I took some pills to stay awake son
And this diamond ring I wear is just for show
I've got a little cabin in the country
When I'm not on the road that's where I go
Try and put my feelings down on paper
Right or wrong the show has to go on
I can cry down deep inside and keep on smilin'
While I sing another pretty country song
But I've got to take a drink to keep from shakin'She loves the music, tells the tales of her heart
And she listens closely to the beats and the parts
She likes the songs that make her cry
And ones that pick her up and make her high
She likes the hip-hop, she loves to rock it,
She's got the country on her iPod on her pocket
She loves the guitar, she likes the fiddle,
She even likes the ones where they're just talking rhyme and riddles
And she sings along when she's driving home going all alone,
Her life's a song
And she likes the songs that take her back and make her want,
Sometimes she just wants to dance and move on
She taps her feet and sheds a tear
Plays air guitar and raises a beer
She likes the hip-hop, she loves to rock it ,
She's got the country on her iPod on her pocket
She loves the guitar, she likes the fiddle,
She even likes the ones where they're just talking rhyme and riddles
And she sings along when she's driving home going all alone,
Her life's a song
At times she sings I know just how she feels
A broken heart on a love song that kills
She likes the hip-hop, she loves to rock it,
She's got the country on her iPod in her pocket
She loves the guitar, she likes the fiddle,
She even likes the ones where they're just talking rhyme and riddles
And she sings along as she's driving home going all alone,
Her life's a song
She likes the hip-hop, she loves to rock it,
She's got the country on her iPod in her pocket
She loves the guitar, she likes the fiddle,
She even likes the ones where they're just talking rhyme and riddles
And she sings along when she's driving home going all alone,
Her life's a song
Yeah, her life's a song
Yeah, her life's a song
She sings along
Her life's a song
Yeah a songTHIS MOMENT OF LOVE
(John D. Loudermilk)
'60 Shelby Singleton Music, BMI
This moment of love is tender and true this moment of love will tie me to you
For you are the one that I've waited for
And now when it's here never to bear this moment of love
Stars seem a little bit nearer the moonlight peepin' through the trees
Each kiss a little bit dearer this is heaven to me
Oh this moment of love is here in my arms surrendering of my love to her charms
Please hold me tonight your heart next to mine
Without you I know it couldn't be so this moment of love
Stars seem a little bit nearer the moonlight peepin' through the trees
Each kiss a little bit dearer this is heaven to me
Oh this moment of love is with us tonight and if it should fade and pass out of sight
Each day I would live the memory of
I'll never forget never regret this moment of love this moment of love
This moment of loveNow brother and I are all alone
We have no place to call our home
It'll never be like home no more
Till we meet them on that other shore
Oh, mother dear and daddy too
We wish that we were there with you
It's not the same since you're away
We'll see you mother and dad someday
Now mother and dad were old you know
It hurt us so to see them go
It's not the same since they are gone
Oh mother and dad, we're so alone
Oh, mother dear and daddy too
We wish that we were there with you
It's not the same since you're away
We'll see you mother and dad someday
Our little home will tumble down
Since mother and dad are not around
What is a home without a friend?
I can never go back home again
Oh, mother dear and daddy too
We wish that we were there with you
It's not the same since you're away
We'll see you mother and dad somedayI lit my love and watched it burn
Asking nothing in return
Except the lessons I will learn
From holding crazy faith
I've been touched by that bright fire
Down to the root of my desire
While the smoke, it rises higher
Glowing crazy faith
You're not asking if I love this man
I know you don't, you don't believe you can
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancer's fan
It's crazy, I know but my faith says so
It tells me
Am I a fool for hanging long?
Would I be a fool for being long gone?
When is daylight gonna dawn
On my crazy faith?
The questions will not let me sleep
The dance is buried way too deep
But the bottom lover, lover's keep
Made by crazy faith
You're not asking if I love this man
I know you don't, you don't believe you can
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancer's fan
It's crazy, I know but my faith says so
It tells me
Love, you're losing those you love
Let the hope fly from the glove
Do not search the skies above
Search your crazy faith
Love is lightning, love is ice
It only strikes the lucky twice
Once or you will know the price
And once for crazy faith
You're not asking if I love this man
I know you don't, you don't believe you can
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancer's fan
It's crazy, I know, but my faith says soI met her in a church on a Sunday evening
Not late on Saturday night
She sang Ave Maria a little flat and out of time
But that's what drew me to her, so that's alright
As she placed a nickle in the basket
That I held before her
I asked her to be my wife
And there's one cardboard heart
For every time you said I love you
A painted star for every secret that we shared
The dried Lima beans and small plastic birds
Because you cared
I hear their talk and I watch them swap
Their old black and whites
Bitter and beaten they talk of life's cheatin'
Like old boxers comparing scars
All I remember is a smile at the top of every working morning
And a shoulder always willing and able
And all those nights that we'd spend just sitting
And talking around our kitchen table
And there's one cardboard heart
For every time you said I love you
A painted star for every secret that we shared
The dried Lima beans and small plastic birds
Because you cared
Five rooms made stronger by the breaking and the healing
Of the two hearts they protected within
Now one heart left aching, just piecing and painting
These walls with the memories of all that is real
And there's one cardboard heart
For every time you said I love you
A painted star for every secret that we shared
The dried Lima beans and small plastic birds
Because you cared
And there's one cardboard heart
For every time you said I love you
A painted star for every secret that we shared
The dried Lima beans and small plastic birds
Because you caredI don't believe in superstars,
Organic food and foreign cars.
I don't believe the price of gold;
The certainty of growing old.
That right is right and left is wrong,
That north and south can't get along.
That east is east and west is west.
And being first is always best.
But I believe in love.
I believe in babies.
I believe in Mom and Dad.
And I believe in you.
Well, I don't believe that heaven waits,
For only those who congregate.
I like to think of God as love:
He's down below, He's up above.
He's watching people everywhere.
He knows who does and doesn't care.
And I'm an ordinary man,
Sometimes I wonder who I am.
But I believe in love.
I believe in music.
I believe in magic.
And I believe in you.
Well, I know with all my certainty,
What's going on with you and me,
Is a good thing.
It's true, I believe in you.
I don't believe virginity,
Is as common as it used to be.
In working days and sleeping nights,
That black is black and white is white.
That Superman and Robin Hood,
Are still alive in Hollywood.
That gasoline's in short supply,
The rising cost of getting by.
But I believe in love.
I believe in old folks.
I believe in children.
I believe in you.
But I believe in love.
I believe in babies.
I believe in Mom and Dad.
And I believe in you.Drive-in shows covered with snow but we never felt the cold
We bought us a blanket we always meant to thank it for hugging us so close
In kick around clothes at downtown in windows we posed
I cling to your warmth while you're tugged on my arm
Our eyes passing funny little notes
Long life lots of happiness good wife lots of pretty kids
We gotta be one one happy time
It was a bitter wine our first sip of time then we drank till the sweet stuff ran dry
Through sunshine and roses the winter's red noses the days softly tiptoeing by
Now they're the good ol' days as they come back to play on my mind
The laughter the pain how we fought off the rain
We lived by those silly old lines
Long life lot's of happiness...
Long life lot's of happiness...Oh dear, out here
Everybody stumbles on fear
Who cares if we're scared?
Everyone is on their own
It's only you that my heart desires
Only you alone can know my pain
All alone you were sitting there
Folding pages for your paper chain
Now you can cut me free
Forever say goodbye
Or we'll be holding hands and go on
Together you and I forever
Heartbreaks, mistakes
Catching up to me in all the ways
I've known of hard days
And my share of lonely nights
It's only you that my heart desires
Only you alone can break my fall
I pace the floor and I wish for more
While you were dreaming with your paper dolls
Now you can cut me free
To when it all unfolds
We'll be holding hands and go on
Together you and I foreverI been workin' my job like a dog all week
tryin' ta make a livin tryin' ta make ends meet
bringin' home the bacon for the family
but every now and then all the boys and me
we get a little restless when the Friday sun goes down
so if you're like me, set your horses free, and let that cowboy out
Saddle up, we'll ride in to town
find ourselves a party with a, party crowd
saddle up, stay up all night
howlin' at the moon, shootin' out the lights
theres no time to rest in the wild wild west
so if you wanna ride with meee, saddle up, saddle up
there ain't nothin' better than swingin' doors
pair of old boots on a sawdust floor
stompin out of rhythm everybody gettin' loud
so if you're like me, set your horses free
and let that cowboy out
Saddle up, we'll ride in to town
find ourselves a party with a, party crowd

saddle up, saddle up, oh saddle up, aww saddle upTo dance all night the break of day
With a caller and a holler do-si-do
We knew uncle Pen was ready to go
Early in the evening about sundown
High on the hill and above the town
Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord how it ring
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing
Well he played another tune called soldier's joy
And played the one called the Boston Boy
First of all was Jenny Lynn
For me that's where the fiddle begins
I'll never forget that mournful day
When uncle pen was called away
He hung his fiddle and hang up his bow
He knew it was time for him to goI wish I could break your heart
I wish I could bring you down
Just for a second, teach you a lesson about being alone in the dark
I wish I could make you cry
So hard you can barely breath
And maybe you just might know what it feels like
Oh to be me
Well the truth is that I never ever wanna hurt you baby
But it'd be nice to know that I could
Be strong enough to pull you under, throw you back a little under thunder
Even though I never would
I wish I could break, I wish I could break your heart
I wish I could crush your dreams
I wish I could turn back time
Boy I'd lead you on light the fuse, drop the bomb
Just so I'd be the first to leave
Well the truth is that I never ever wanna hurt you baby
But it'd be nice to know that I could
Be strong enough to pull you under, throw you back a little under thunder
Even though I never would
I wish I could break, I wish I could break your heart
I wish I could break your heart
I wish I could make you cry
I wish I could turn back time
Well the truth is that I never ever wanna hurt you baby
But it'd be nice to know that I could
Be strong enough to pull you under, throw you back a little under thunder
Even though I never would
I wish I could break, I wish I could break your heart
I wish I could break your heart
I wish I could break your heartIf I'd left you the first time you've hurt me
The hurt might already be gone
But I love you so much that I can't live without you
And somehow I kept hanging on
My love's strong enough to live through your weakness
And forget each bad thing as it's done
I've given you ten thousand chances
And here goes ten thousand and one
Ten thousand and one ten thousand and one
As sure as the morning will come
Ten thousand chances and I've just begun
Here goes ten thousand and one
I marvel my love just grows stronger
No matter what you do wrong
I can't shake the feeling God made me for you
And it keeps me right where I belong
Ten thousand and one ten thousand and one
Here goes ten thousand and oneNow come and listen to my story
A story that I know is true
A little rose that bloomed in Georgia
With hair of gold and a heart so true
Way down in the blue ridge mountains
Way down where the tall pines grow
Lives my sweetheart of the mountains
She's my little Georgia rose
Her mother left her with another
A carefree life she had planned
The baby now she is a lady
The one her mother couldn't stand
We often sing those songs together
I watched her do her little part
She smiled at me when I would tell her
That she was my sweetheartThe candles burning out, it's almost gone
It's not gonna make it, until the dawn
Lying here, have I had enough
Of asking myself, would I give you up?
But I will always, wait right here for you
It's nothing new
I will always, wait right here for you
It's nothing new, it's what I do
The bottles gone, didn't take too long
One more drink, and I'd be gone
Laying here, in an empty room
Asking God, should I leave you soon?
But I will always, wwait right here for you
It's nothing new
I will always, wait right here for you
It's nothing new, it's what I do
I will always wait right here for you, it's nothing new
I will always wait right here for you, that's what I do
That's what I do
I'll wait on you
It's nothing new
It's what I doI'm throwing rice at the girl that I love
After she just said, "I do"
I'm throwing rice with a smile on my lips
But my heart is breaking in two
She was my gal and he was my pal
But she loved him better somehow
I stepped aside after I kissed the bride
And I'm throwing rice at her now
I'm throwing rice at the girl that I love
After she just said, "I do"
I'm throwing rice with a smile on my lips
But my heart is breaking in two
She was my gal and he was my pal
But she loved him better somehow
I stepped aside after I kissed the bride
And I'm throwing rice at her nowThere's always one more day
Always one more call
Always one more try
To explain it all
If that's what you think
You'd better be keeping score
'Cause sooner or later
You'll be down to your last one more
There's always one more promise
Always one more word
Always one more excuse
She hasn't heard
So there's really no danger
You've broken her heart before
Well sooner or later
You'll be down to your last one more
You think your supply
Of second chances
Will never run dry will never run out
You think there'll be time
To men you fences
Isn't that what forgiveness is all about
There's always one more letter
Always one more kiss
Well brother you better conscious of this
Nothing lasts forever that what a zero's for
And sooner or later you'll be
Down to your last one moreI left my old home in the mountains
And the only friends I ever had
And while I rambled this world over
My heart felt so lonely and sad
I'm going back to the old home
Back to the place I love so well
Where the sweet waters flow and the wildflowers grow
Back to the old home on the hill
I know that dear old mother's waiting
Waiting alone on that hill
With the silver in her hair and a twinkle in her eye
In the old cabin home on the hill
Years have gone by since I saw her
I've traveled many a mile
But tonight there's a light in the window
And she's waiting at the door with a smileDon't let me cross over
Love's cheating line
I'm tempted, my darling
To steal you away
Don't let me cross over
Stay out of my way
You know that I love you
And I'm not the stealing kind
But I'm faced with heartaches
And love's cheating line
Don't let me cross over
Love's cheating line
You belong to another
And can never be mine
I know one step closer
Would be heaven divine
Don't let me cross over
Love's cheating line
I've tried to forget you
But what else can I do
When your eyes keep saying
That you love me too
I know if I lose you
Not a dream will be left
I don't want to cheat dear
But I can't help myself
Don't let me cross over
Love's cheating line
You belong to another
And can never be mine
I know one step closer
Would be heaven divine
Don't let me cross over
Love's cheating lineThere's something 'bout yesterday
How fast it all flies away
I don't know what it is about a goodbye kiss
That makes you wanna stay
We were crazy then we were over
We were breaking up, making love, a runaway roller coaster
Every time I hear that song
I'm standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
I still think about you
There's something in the bittersweet
The feeling of a memory
Right there in the moment
All I ever wanted was you and me
We were crying, we were wasted
We were dying when they played it
Every time I hear that song
I'm standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
I still think about you
Oh I still think about you
There's a soundtrack in my mind
That takes me back in time
When I hear that melody
I think about you and me
Every time I hear that song
I'm standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
I still think about you
Oh, I still think about you
I still think about you
Yeah, I still think about you
There's a soundtrack in my mind
That takes me back in time
When I hear that melodyGirl I know that I promised you
I could make your every dream come true
But I admit I've got a little ways to go
Trust me baby we're closin' in quick
Before you know it we'll be stckin' the bricks
So stick like glue we got nothin' to lose
And baby don't stop we're just a gettin' started
Don't quit now we got our foot in the door
Say you're not about to end the party
Baby hang on tight just a little bit more
I stand behind every word I say I love you baby
There's your reason to stay
Don't be flip floppin' when you know that we're rockin' along
I can't believe you want to throw in the towel
Stop and think of what I'm talking about
You threw your hat in the ring so go and get that thing
And baby don't stop we're just a gettin' started
Like an old violin or vintage wine all good things come in good time
We might run out of road but it ain't the end of the line
Honey I swear up and down our turn's about to come around
We'll have it all in the long haul
And baby don't stop we're just a gettin' started
Oh baby don't stop we're just a gettin' startedCindy was a ragged angel just a poor little girl on the street
Cindy's eyes showed signs of hunger never had enough to eat
Cindy was a ragged angel golden hair and eyes of blue
Cindy loved her paper dolly that's the only love she knew
Cindy never knew her daddy and her mommie was seldom home
Except for Cindy's paper dolly Cindy was all alone
Cindy slept with her paper dolly on a blanket on the floor
She would shiver as the wind blew through the crack beneath the door
One night she laid with her paper dolly cold and hungry on the floor
That night God came for the ragged angel
And now Cindy won't ever be cold and hungry no not anymore
Ragged angelLook at me walking the streets at 3 a.m.
And you're saying what a crazy fool I am
But the one I love is out tonight with him
Somewhere making love at 3 a.m.
I need a drink but all the bars are locked up tight
A lonely man gets mighty thirsty late at night
I won't ever kiss her sweet, sweet lips again
This old world's an awful place at 3 a.m.
--- Instrumental ---
There's the river here's the bridge it's too late now
I've got nothing left to live for anyhow
In the news they'll say he couldn't even swim
And he gave his love for love at 3 a.m.
Yes, he gave his life for love at 3 a.m...Love is gone but not forgotten, memories are very much alive
Life goes on and life goes well
But I wonder if I'll ever lose the pain of missing you
Missing you it won't let me be wishing you were missing me
Missing you I'll never be free from missing you missing me
You were here and then you left me
well who's to say where anyone belongs
I know now that I'll get by but, I wonder if I'll ever lose the pain of missing you
Missing you it won't let me beShe didn't have to marry down so far
[Incomprehensible] with raising babies or driving older car
She didn't have to give so much and be so underpaid
Lord, I don't know how she's living with the choices she made
She didn't have to wear those bargain threads
[Incomprehensible] those dandy hands, moping floors and changing beds
She had a sweet on easy street, with her hand she could have played
But she threw out all her aces for the choices she made
She'll stand there in defiance of a logic she ignored
The springs lay peaceful smile upon her face
Using up her youth on some old cowboy
Would finally pay the bills on hope and faith
Time goes by, it doesn't change a thing
But she still thinks it's worth it all to wear that little ring
And I still lay beside her wishing I was worth the price she paid
All teary eyed and thankful for the choices she madeOnce a day all day long and once a night from dusk till dawn
The only time I wish you weren't gone is once a day every day all day long
When I found somebody new I thought I never would
Forget you for I thought then I never could
But time has taken all the pain away until now I'm down to hurtin' once a day
Once a day all day long...
I'm so glad that I'm not like a friend I knew one time
He lost the one he's loved then slowly lost his mind
He sat around and cried his life away lucky me I'm only crying once a day
Once a day all day long...
Once a day every day all day longmusic and lyrics by Corb Lund
Family reunion, shes gonna be a good one
So lemme bend your ear, the clans all here for the family reunion
Well my cowboy uncles sing cowboy songs
And they get drunk and the words get wrong
My Blackfoot cousins say theyre comin this year
Well I hope they do and I hope they bring beer
You got the Mormons and the drinkers and the Mormons who drink
Well pay attention cause it ain't as simple as you think
They say there's some that don't believe in either
But I ain't seen 'em yet and my pa ain't neither
Well then I run into my favourite aunt
And she says Corb, you still playin in that band?
Well, I guess as long as youre havin fun
And you make a little money but were prayin for ya, son
Theres a whole lotta cousins that I aint met yet
So you can imagine the shock I get
Theres one of them I think I mighta dated back in school
But thats alright, in Alberta thats coolWait a little longer please Jesus there are so many still wandering out in sin
Just a little longer please Jesus a few more days to get our loved ones in
Here the labor is so hard and the workers are so tired
And our weary hearts are yearning for a rest
And we find we're gettin' anxious to be in that happy home
Where we'll reseive such peace and happiness
But wait a little longer please Jesus
We may look into the skies and tears will fill our eyes
When our burdened hearts grow heavier with each day
First we cry oh Lord please come come and take your children home
Then we look around and suddenly we say
But wait a little longer please JesusShe's long she's tall, she six feet from the ground
She's long she's tall, she six feet from the ground
She tailor made, lord she ain't no hand me down
Oh-di-lay-ee-ay, di-lay-dee-oh, de-lay-ee
She got eyes like diamonds, lord her teeth shine just the same
She got eyes like diamonds and her teeth shine just the same
She got sweet ruby lips, and a hair like a horse's mane
Oh-di-lay-ee-ay, di-lay-dee-oh, de-lay-ee
Every time I see you mama, you're always on the street
Every time I see you mama, you're always on the street
You hang out on the corner, like a police on his beat
Oh-di-lay-ee-ay, di-lay-dee-oh, de-lay-ee
Every time I need you mama, lord I always find you're gone
Every time I need you mama, lord I always find you're gone
Listen hear sweet mama, I'm gonna put your air brakes on
Oh-di-lay-ee-ay, di-lay-dee-oh, de-lay-eeHe's packed up his boots and his saddle
Seventeen, headin' out on his own
He'll rodeo from Cheyenne to Texas
Dreamin' of one ride in Vegas
One ride in Vegas
Lonely nights in rundown motel rooms
Achin' bone from yesterday's ride
It's takin' more than he thought he could give it
But he's holdin' on for one ride in Vegas
One ride in Vegas
He's riskin' it all, driven by a hunger
That never will let him give up
And with a fire in his eyes, he dances with thunder
Till one day his day finally comes
His heart beats fast with anticipation
And brighter lights than the kid has ever seen before
He's waited his whole life for the next eight seconds
And he'd do it all again for one ride in Vegas
This one ride in VegasIt gets longer in between each time you call
I'd be safe in sayin' you no longer care at all
We're never seem together like we used to be
Tell me darling whatever happened to me
I once played a big part in your world think back and I know you'll agree
You still play a big part in my world but whatever happened to me
I can't keep myself from asking what went wrong
I've made up my own excuses for so long
Please forgive me if I'm just too blind to see
And tell me darling whatever happened to me
Please forgive meOh, you ask me if my heart is true, if my love will ever fade
Well, I don't know how to answer you any other way
I'm yours for all eternity, until the end of time
When the angels finally come for me, you will still be mine
[Chorus]
Then they'll gather on the hillside and they'll sing Amazing Grace
And a limousine will carry me to my final resting place
A preacher man will read the book, my family will cry
Then they'll bury with your memory and a love that never die
Now they say someday the stars won't burn
And the seas won't reach the shore
When the sun goes out and the world won't turn
I will only love you more
And it that bye and bye when there's nothing left
My heart will be unchanged
Even with my dying breath
I'll be whispering your name
[Chorus]
Oh, they'll bury me with your memory and a love that never dieThe one I love so much told me goodbye it hurt so much but I didn't cry
I let a smile hide my misery mama you'd have been proud of me
Yesterday I thought to him just like a friend smiled and asked him how he'd been
Said I hope you're happy as can be mama you'd have been proud of me
And if you could have seen me today I'd smile and laugh in my old carefree way
They thought that I was like I'd like to be mama you'd have been proud of me
Mama you'd have been proud of meDid you take your mother's name so you could sleep easily
She took you back too late and now you never leave alone
Did you take that money drawer while she was praying
They said you disappeared
Just like water down a drain
Why'd you call me, must be bad
Disappointed man, where've you been
Hide yourself so well, in this city
Disappointed man
Did you sell your father's ring so you could stay one more night
It shone like his glass eye in the worn velvet case
Did you fill this hired room with guilty words
Your white piano hands flutter like poison birds
Why'd you call me, must be bad
Disappointed man, where've you been
Hide yourself so well, in this city
Disappointed man, where've you been
Disappointed man, where've you been
Disappointed manUh, uh
It was the middle of June, me and my grand mama
Had some free time, flew to Panama
I was playin' the bar, sippin' a Margarita
When this chick from Argentina, her name Armenita
She told me you could make some fast cash
You help me change my name from Vasquez to your name
Take me to your domain
Trick, you must be out yo' brain
She said it's no game, my pops got tons of cocaine
And you could have some if you get me on your plane
I said here the dealie, you sound silly
Think hard, there gotta be another way to get you a green card
Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?
I promise you, we gon' see the world
It 'id be like paradise, baby
Rosalie you don't know who I suppose to be
But whatever you wanna be? You can come go wit' me
Her last thoughts thinking I'mma get her a passport
Whatever you need ma, just ask for it
Now she lunch meat, she look at J like she home free
J, can you really get me in your country?
No lie, I can do whatever I mo' tie, so fly
Mami started offering me chochas
Certainly the way she flirt wit' me
If I get her in the US she work for free
Though she nice to me, I'm runnin' twice the G
For the right price, she could be a wife to me
Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?
I promise you, we gon' see the world
It 'id be like paradise, baby
Hey girl, you wanna go wit' me?
I promise you, we gon' see the world
But if you cross me, you lost me forever, baby
I got a girl out in Asia, name Malaysia
Who was a real bad chick that owns a Bodega
She wanted me to save her and make her life greater
Cuz her dad hates her and rapes her
She tried to get some paper
When you wanna leave, I'mma take ya
In fact, pack ya things, I got a crib in Jamaica
Mami, mi casa a su casa
We could do the salsa so, que pasa?
She said she had money but it was all in trust funds
But I could get a lump sum if I can get her through customs
So bring the cake, we gon' swing outta state
I'mma make you dream when you awake
Yo Loon, sing the break, what
Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?
I promise you, we gon' see the world
It 'id be like paradise, baby
In the middle of Nicaragua, met a mami named Talia
Weren't plain, then I caught a boat wit' this dumb dame
An immigrant, marry her, make her legitimate
Illiterate, mess wit' Hud, she don't consider it
She said pa, llevame contigo
Lean dough and I'mma pay yo' peoples
This retard chick started looking at me hard
She gassed up thinkin' I'mma get her a green card
And she don't know that she ain't coming wit' me
And I don't stuck up for some hundreds of G's
And while I see her standing there lookin' around
Huddy took the money, slid outta town, what? uh?
Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?
I promise you, we gon' see the world
It 'id be like paradise, baby
Hey girl, you wanna go wit' me?
I promise you, we gon' see the world
But if you cross me, you lost me forever, baby
I mean this
Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?
I promise you, we gon' see the world
It 'id be like paradise, baby
Hey girl, you wanna go wit' me?
I promise you, we gon' see the world
But if you cross me, you lost me forever, baby
I mean this
Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?
I promise you, we gon' see the world
It 'id be like paradise, baby
Hey girl, you wanna go wit' me?
I promise you, we gon' see the world
But if you cross me, you lost me forever, baby
I mean this
Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?
I promise you, we gon' see the world
It 'id be like paradise, babyI ain't had a day off in I don't know when
Thought I might go fishin', then I thought again
Hell I don't even want to have to reel one in
So I pulled my old truck down here in the shade
Spread my jacket out on the tailgate
I've been lying here just drifting away
Chillaxin' with my boot heals kicked up
Cat nappin' between beers and dips of snuff
It's a hell of a way to waste a whole day
No worries, no distractions
Layed on back beneath this ol' straw hat
Chillaxin'
Right now I feel like that old groundhog
Chewin' on a blade of grass underneath that log
Lettin' the world go by without a care at all
Chillaxin' with my boot heals kicked up
Cat nappin' between beers and dips of snuff
It's a hell of a way to waste a whole day
No worries, no distractions
Layed on back beneath this ol' straw hat
Chillaxin'
If this cooler full of Bud lasts the whole weekend
I'll be right here tomorrow to do it all again
Chillaxin'
Cat nappin'
It's a hell of a way to waste a whole day
No worries, no distractions
Layed on back beneath this ol' straw hat
Chillaxin'
Yeah it's a hell of a way to waste a whole day
No worries, no distractions
Layed on back beneath this ol' straw hat
Chillaxin'
Yeah chillaxin'She wears her heart
Upon her sleeve and doesn't think
The world can see
Behind a smile she hopes can seize
Her broken box of memories
White lies in windows
Easy to see through
Look with your heart
Look with your eyes
You'll see the world or a heart that's been broken
Looking through windows and white lies
He rakes the ashes of yesterday
For something he can't wear with pride
He says he could have had it all
If only he had tried
White lies in windows
Easy to see through
Look with your heart
Look with your eyes
You'll see the world or a heart that's been broken
Looking through windows and white lies
And we all hide sometimes
Behind the life
It's a fool's game
Its ourselves we deceive
She says she's glad
She never married
No one to hurt
No one to please
Children would have only tied her down
Stolen her fantasy
White lies in windows
Easy to see through
Look with your heart
Look with your eyes
You'll see the world or a heart that's been broken
Looking through windows and white lies
Looking through windows and white liesBring back, bring back
Bring back your love to me
I need your kisses
Oh, how I'm missing
The things that used to be
I love you, I want you
I need you constantly
If you'll just come back home
I'm begging please
Bring back your love to me
Days and nights go crawling by
Where is the love that I knew?
Everything is wrong
Nothing seems right
Except this longing for you
I've cried and I've tried
What more than this poor fool do?
If you'll just come back home
I'm begging please
Bring back your love to me
Bring back, bring back
Bring back your love to me
I need your kisses
Oh, how I'm missing
The things that used to be
I love you, I want you
I need you constantly
If you'll just come back home
I'm begging please
Bring back your love to me
Bring back, bring back
Bring back your love to me
I need your kissesOh, I've been stumblin' through the darkness
Tryin' to feel the ground beneath my feet
Afraid of movin' much in any direction
Stuck where the past and the future meet
But I fin'lly got my first good look
A little fire was all it too
An' as the flames grew brighter
I saw everything that I'd missed
Once you get your courage up
You light a match an' your eyes adjust
It's amazing what a man can see
By the light of a burnin' bridge
An' there were things I saw that I'm not proud of
Things that I'd do diff'rent now from then
But when I really make myself get honest
It's over and I can't go back again
'Cause I fin'lly got my first good look
A little fire was all it took
An' as the flames grew brighter
I saw everything that I'd missed
Once you get your courage up
You light a match an' your eyes adjust
It's amazing what a man can see
By the light of a burnin' bridge
It sure is hard to let go and to leave the past behind
But there ain't no other way that you can find some peace of mind
When I fin'lly got my first good look
A little fire was all it took
An' as the flames grew brighter
I saw everything that I'd missed
Once you get your courage up
You light a match an' your eyes adjust
It's amazing what a man can see
By the light of a burnin' bridge
It's amazing what a man can see
By the light of a burnin' bridgeOh, yonder stand Little Maggie
With her dram glass in her hand
She's a-drinkin' away all her troubles
And a-courtin' some other man
Lord, how can I ever stand it
For to see them pretty blue eyes
A-spidin' at another
Like two diamonds in the midnight sky
Come and go with me to the station
Got my suitcase in my hand
I'm goin' away Little Maggie
Lord, I'm goin' to some far and distand land
Oh, yonder stand Little Maggie
With her dram glass in her hand
She's a-drinkin' away all her troubles
And a-courtin' some other man
Go away, go away Little Maggie
Go and do the best you can
I'll get me another woman
You can get you another man
Yonder stand Little Maggie
With her dram glass in her hand
She's a-drinkin' away all her troubles
And a-courtin' some other manI am a roving gambler I gambled all around
Whenever I meet with a deck of cards
I lay my money down
Lay my money down, lay my money down
I had not been in Washington many more weeks than three
I met up with a pretty little girl
She fell in love with me
She fell in love with me, fell in love with me
She took me in her parlor, she cooled me with a fan
She whispered low in her mother's ears
I love that gambling man
Love that gambling man, love that gambling man
Oh daughter oh dear daughter how can you treat me so?
Leave your dear old mother
And with that gambler go
With that gambler go, with that gambler go
My mother, oh dear mother you can not understand
If you ever see me coming back
I'll be with a gambling man
With that gambling man, with that gambling man
I left her in El Paso and I wound up in Maine
I met up with a gambling man
Got in a poker game
Got in a poker game, got in a poker game
We put our money in the pot and dealt the cards around
I saw him deal from the bottom of the deck
Shot that gambler down
Shot that gambler down, shot that gambler down
Well, now I'm in the jailhouse got a number for my name
The Warden said as he locked the door
You've gambled your last game
Gambled your last game, gambled your last game
I am a roving gambler I gambled all around
Whenever I meet with a deck of cards
I lay my money down
Lay my money down, lay my money downI remember walkin' 'round the court square sidewalk
Lookin' in windows at things I couldn't want
There's Johnson's hardware and Morgan's jewelry
And the ol' Lee king's apothecary
They ware the little man
The little man
I go back now and the stores are all empty
Except for an old coke sign from 1950
Boarded up like they never existed
Or renovated and called historic districts
There goes the little man
There goes the little man
Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
Bout the little man that built this town
Before the big money shut em down
And killed the little man
Oh the little man
He pumped your gas and he cleaned your glass
And one cold rainy night he fixed your flat
The new stores came where you do it yourself
You buy a lotto ticket and food off the shelf
Forget the little man
Forget about that little man
He hung on there for a few more years
But he couldn't sell slurpees
And he wouldn't sell beer
Now the bank rents the station
To a down the road
And sell velvet Elvis and
Second-hand clothes
There goes little man
There goes another little man
Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
Bout the little man that built this town
Before the big money shut em down
And killed the little man
Oh the little man
Now the stores are lined up in a concrete strip
You can buy the world with just one trip
And save a penny 'cause it's jumbo size
They don't even realize
They're killin' the little man
Oh the little man
Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
Bout the little man that built this town
Before the big money shut em down
And killed the little man
Oh the little man
It wasn't long when I was a child
An old black man came with his mule and his plow
He broke the ground where we grew our garden
Back before we'd all forgot about the little man
The little man
Long live the little man
God bless the little manThere's no reason to be seen
No one knows where i have been,
Where i have been
I mean love is what i mean
Joy, joy and jubilee
Joy, joy and jubilee
Joy, joy and jubilee
Joy, joy and jubilee
This is what i want to be
Everything inside of me,
Inside of me
Where only shoes should be
Joy, joy and jubilee
Joy, joy and jubilee
Joy, joy and jubilee
Joy, joy and jubileeKentucky you are the dearest land and sign of heaven to me
Kentucky your meadows and your apple trees
When I die I want to rest upon your crisp mountain so high
Kentucky where God will look for me
Kentucky I miss the young folks singing in the silvery moonlight
Kentucky I miss the hound dog chasing too
I know that my mother dad and sweetheart all are waiting for me
Kentucky I will be coming soonWell my friend you ask me what to do
If I were you, and feeling blue
I know inside that you still care
You want her here, but she's out there
Don't leave her lonely too long
'Cause she'll be gone, gone, gone
Don't leave her lonely too long
'Cause she'll be gone, gone, gone
You still have time to change her mind
She needs to know, the way you feel
And there could be no better time
You've got to show her your love is real
Don't leave her lonely too long
'Cause she'll be gone, gone, gone
Don't leave her lonely too long
'Cause she'll be gone, gone, gone
There's strangers waiting in line
To take your place and leave you behind
And then too late you'll change your mind
Your heart will break a million times
Don't leave her lonely too long
'Cause she'll be gone, gone, gone
Don't leave her lonely too long
'Cause she'll be gone, gone, gone
She'll be gone, gone, goneThat's what I'm talkin' about
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
I cut my teeth on an old lawn-mower
Cleanin' out gutters, doin' other people's chores
After school, weekends an' holidays
Yeah, ever since then, all I've known
Is my nose on fire from the grindstone
A lifetime built on an hourly wage
Muscled arms an' calloused hands
I am the workin' man
The sun comes up, the sun goes down
Gotta keep this world turnin' 'round
Blazin' hot, freezin' cold
No matter what, it still goes on
Pushin', pullin', pourin', mixin'
Somebody's gotta fix it
I am the workin' man, yes, I am
Now, I've laid asphalt an' I've laid brick
I've hung sheet, rock and shovelled shit
Eat my lunch down at the Kwickie-Mart
Oh, I fill the potholes on easy-street
So show some respect when you look at me
I'm just out here tryin' to do my part
An' I sleep good when the day comes to an end
'Cause I am the workin' man
The sun comes up, the sun goes down
Gotta keep this world turnin' 'round
Blazin' hot, freezin' cold
No matter what, it still goes on
Pushin', pullin', pourin', mixin'
Somebody's gotta fix it
I am the workin' man
I can swing a hammer, turn a wrench
Build a tower, dig a ditch
Drive a truck that shakes the earth
Somebody's gotta do the dirty work
The sun comes up, the sun goes down
Gotta keep this world turnin' 'round
Blazin' hot, freezin' cold
No matter what, it still goes on
Pushin', pullin', pourin', mixin'
Somebody's gotta fix it
I am, I am the workin' man
Yes, I am oh, the workin' manI can see my old hotel
Down amongst the smells
I'm up above that ancient city river
It's filtered by my lousy liver
It's filtered by my wilted lily liver
I can see my old hotel
It ain't even a hotel
5am there came some sleet or hail
It was signal taps on the brave window
Solemn taps on the wavy window
I can see my old hotel
Hear those old touristy bells
Soon I'll be down the hill shopping
Giddy like a tipsy Mary Poppins
Giddy like a tipsy Mary Poppins
I can see my old hotel
It ain't even a hotel
I'm scheduled to ride the rails
If I wished to stay on this tower
Things would derange given just another hourI did the laundry,
I cleaned the kitchen
Swept up the pieces of those broken dishes
I drank my coffee while yours got colder
All while you were hungover
Baby, your head ain't the only thing hurting you know
The sun keeps com in' up even if the curtains are closed
That girl in the mirror I got to know her
All while you were hungover
I got a new job, I gave up smoking'
I changed my lipstick, and those roses opened
I let my hair grow past my shoulders
All while you were hungover
Baby, your head ain't the only thing hurting you know
The sun keeps com in' up even if the curtains are closed
That girl in the mirror I got to know her
All while you were hungover
Got a little bit stronger, got a little bit older
All while you were hungover
I left he laundry and those broken dishes
Called my sister and bought a ticket
I got a good start on startin' over
All while you were hungoverThrill me with your big warm smile love me in your sweetest style
I want to be where you're gonna be tonight
Let me look into your eyes feel like I'm in paradise
I want to be where you're gonna be tonight
I'm just not good without you you're the one for me
I love everything about you it's all plain to see
You gotta let me hold you longer you gotta let our love grow stronger
I want to be where you're gonna be tonight
[ steel ]
I want you near me every day to hear the sweet things that you say
I want to be where you're gonna be tonight
Want you give our love a chance I'm in the mood for sweet romance
I want to be where you're gonna be tonight
I'm just not good without you...
I want to be where you're gonna be tonight(Porter Wagoner)
He left me love enough to last a lifetime
A lifetime filled with loving memories
And so I have no reason to search for new love
Time could never take his love from me
And my mind is filled with memories, sweet and tender
My heart is filled with love he left for me
And each thought of him just makes love grow sweeter
He left me love to last eternally
I just close my eyes and I still see him
And in dreams, he loves me just like he used to do
He even wakes me with a tender kiss every mornin'
A kiss that lingers on my lips the whole day through
And my mind is filled with memories, sweet and tender
And my heart is filled with love he left for me
And each thought of him just makes love grow sweeter
He left me love to last eternally
Oh, yes, he left me loveOh oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh
Red sun, saltwater dripping, haze
Stick-shift, summer Sahara, chains
We ain't alone
Blue lights on the horizon
Dust clouds filling the sky
If they get the cuffs on us
It's twenty-five to life
Run, run, your own direction
And I'll lead 'em down a different road
Take the gun, hide the car and the money
I'll meet you in Mexico
Look for the golden sombrero
Puerto Nuevo west
Blonde had a little too much fun
I'll be brunette
Adios till then
Blue lights on the horizon
Dust clouds filling the sky
If they get the cuffs on us
It's twenty-five to life
Run, run, your own direction
And I'll lead 'em down a different road
Take the gun, hide the car and the money
I'll meet you in Mexico
Oh, run
Oh
Run run run
Blue lights on the horizon
Dust clouds filling the sky
If they get the cuffs on us
It's twenty-five to life
Run, run, your own direction
And I'll lead 'em down a different road
Take the gun, hide the car and the money
I'll meet you in Mexico
Crossing that border; passport says Jane Doe
For a little while, baby, just lay low
Oh oh oh, I'll meet you in Mexico
Suntan, seaside, feeling that breeze blow
We'll be sipping that smooth Don Julio
Oh oh oh, I'll meet you in Mexico, yeah
Oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh, ohIt's deeper than the ocean and higher than the sky
Longer than the highways that we travel by
Truer than the stars that shine in the sky my everlastin' love for you will never die
Well it's sweeter than the flowers that bloom in the spring
Prettier than water in a mountain stream
Brighter than the sun that shines on high my everlastin' love for you will never die
If you would listen to the reason you would know I'm not a teasin'
You'll know what I say is true
You'll know I'm not a fakin' when I say my heart's a breakin'
With love I have for you
Well it's deeper than the ocean...
[ steel - fiddle ]
If you would listen to the reason...
Well it's deeper than the ocean...There'll always be another tear there'll always be another year
There'll be another sky of blue
But no matter what may come or go just one thing I surely know
There'll never ever be another you
There'll always be another smile there'll always be another mile
There'll be another morning dew
Though years may come and years may go this one thing I surely know
There'll never ever be another you
There'll be another teardrop there'll be another raindrop
And there'll be another love that's true
Though love may come and love may go this one thing I surely know
There'll never ever be another you
No there'll never ever be another youWhat a dying world re-defines, the reasons we strive to exist
Refrain control and we're bound to learn the meaning of moments like this
'Cause in the peaceful lull, the quiet
Seduced by the promise of bliss, we soon forget that nothing's happened yet
We're living for moments like this
So hold me, whisper gently this is what we live for, how we learn who we are
It defines us, ever reminding us that life never is more precious than this
From the dim light in the greyness, the aim of the soul tends to miss
Then the clouds catch fire and the oceans pitch
We're made for the moments like this
So hold me, whisper gently that there's nothing to fear
You'll always be near, to remind me, to stand behind me
Although life can be rough we can never give up
It's in our power to face the storm with all its fury and madness
The flash of thunder will be harnessed with the longing and sadness
The clouds will grey.
Hold me. Whisper gently this is what we live for, how we learn how we are
It defines us, ever reminding us that life never is more precious than this
Hold me. Whisper gently that there's nothing to fear,
You'll always be near, to remind me, stand behind me
Although life can be rough we can never give up.This ol' highway's getting longer
Seems there ain't no end in sight
To sleep would be best, but I just can't afford to rest
I've got to ride in Denver tomorrow night
I called the house but no one answered
For the last two weeks no one's been home
I guess she's through with me, to tell the truth I just can't see
What's kept the woman holding on this long
And the white line's getting longer and the saddle's getting cold
I'm much too young to feel this damn old
All my cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole
I'm much too young to feel this damn old
The competition's getting younger
Tougher broncs, you know I can't recall
The worn out tape of Chris LeDoux, lonely women and bad booze
Seem to be the only friends I've left at all
And the white line's getting longer and the saddle's getting cold
I'm much too young to feel this damn old
All my cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole
I'm much too young to feel this damn old
Lord, I'm much too young to feel this damn oldToda vez que eu viajava pela Estrada de Ouro Fino
De longe eu avistava a figura de um menino
Que corria abrir a porteira e depois vinha me pedindo
"Toque o berrante seu moÃ§o que Ã© pra eu ficar ouvindo"
Quando a boiada passava e a poeira ia baixando
Eu jogava uma moeda e ele saÃ­a pulando
"Obrigado boiadeiro, que Deus vÃ¡ lhe acompanhando"
Pra aquele sertÃ£o Ã  fora meu berrante ia tocando
Nos caminhos desta vida muitos espinhos encontrei,
Mas nenhum calou mais fundo do que isso que eu passei
Na minha viagem de volta qualquer coisa eu cismei
Vendo a porteira fechada o menino nÃ£o avistei.
Apeei do meu cavalo e no ranchinho a beira chÃ£o
Vi uma mulher chorando, quis saber qual a razÃ£o
"Boiadeiro veio tarde, veja a cruz no estradÃ£o
Quem matou o meu filhinho foi um boi sem coraÃ§Ã£o"
LÃ¡ pras bandas de Ouro Fino levando gado selvagem
Quando passo na porteira atÃ© vejo a sua imagem
O seu rangido tÃ£o triste mais parece uma mensagem
Daquele rosto trigueiro desejando boa viagem.
A cruzinha no estradÃ£o do pensamento nÃ£o sai
Eu jÃ¡ fiz um juramento que nÃ£o esqueÃ§o jamais
Nem que meu gado estoure, e eu precise ir atrÃ¡s
Neste pedaÃ§o de chÃ£o berrante eu nÃ£o toco maisIn a simple life dreams die hard
You never let 'em go
All the while you play your hands
And you may never know
Why it's always lady luck
On someone else's palm they read
You holding my two hands
Is really all I need
I can get by if it all fell through
Right down to the bottom of my list
I can get by lookin' back on life
Find that I've too many things I've missed
I can get by without doing
All the crazy things some people do
But I wouldn't want to try even
Barely gettin' by without you
Many things I've come to need
That I could do without
And many more I've done without
I could come to need
The one thing that I'd fight to keep
Until my days are through
Is when I lay me down to sleep
I'm lyin' next to you
I can get by if it all fell through
Right down to the bottom of my list
I can get by lookin' back on life
Find that I've too many things I've missed
I can get by without doing
All the crazy things some people do
But I wouldn't want to try even
Barely gettin' by without you
I can get by if it all fell through
Right down to the bottom of my list
I can get by lookin' back on life
Finding I've too many things I've missed
Barely gettin' by without you
I can get by if it all fell through
Right down to the bottom of my list
I can get by lookin' back on life
Find that I've too many things I've missed
I can get by without doing
All the crazy things some people do
But I wouldn't want to try even

BLUE SKIES GO AWAY
DON?T YOU WASTE MY TIME
?CAUSE I DON?T HAVE A PLACE FOR YOU
INSIDE THIS HEART OF MINE
YOU PROMISE BRIGHTER DAYS
BUT NEVER DO COME THROUGH
EVER SINCE SHE WENT AWAY BLUE SKIES
I?VE HAD NO USE FOR YOU
BUT WHEN I SEE THE CLOUDS COME ROLLIN? IN
AND THE HEAVENS TURNIN? GRAY
I CAN TELL I?M BACK AMONG GOOD FRIENDS
WHO KNOW JUST WHAT I CRAVE
Chorus	I ADMIT IT, I?M ADDICTED TO THE RAIN
SHE ALWAYS SAID SHE LOVED TO HEAR IT
ON THE WINDOW PANE
WHILE THE STORM OUTSIDE WAS RAGIN?
WE?D LOVE THE NIGHT AWAY
NO WONDER I?M ADDICTED TO THE RAIN
THERE?S A CALM INSIDE OF ME
WHEN I SEE LIGHTNING FLASH
AND RAIN?S SWEET PERFUME FILLS ME WITH HOPE
THAT SHE JUST MIGHT COME BACK
I CAN HEAR HER IN THE WIND
AND FEEL HER IN THE MIST
AS I WALK THESE STREETS AND WONDER
WHAT WENT WRONG AND WHERE SHE IS
BUT THE ROLLING THUNDER HELPS TO EASE
THE PAIN I FEEL INSIDE
IN THE POURING RAIN NO ONE CAN SEE
THE TEARDROPS IN MY EYES
Repeat Chorus

AND WE?D LOVE THE NIGHT AWAY
NO WONDER I?M ADDICTED TO THE RAIN

And I will love you every step of the way
The road may wind beneath the sky of blue or gray
But I will love you every step of the way
So only love me and love me only
And we will never walk with loneliness
For just as sure as every April turns to May
So will I love you every step of the way
I'll love you only every step of the wayA little love that slowly grows and grows not one that comes and goes
That's all I want from you
A sunny day with hopes up to the sky a kiss and no goodbye
That's all I want from you
Don't let me down oh show me that you care
Remember when you give you also get your share
Don't let me down I have no time to wait
Tomorrow might not come when the dream is dreamed too late
A little love that slowly grows and grows not one that comes and goes
That's all I want from you
(A little love that slowly grows and grows not one that comes and goes)
That's all I want from you
(A sunny day with hopes up to the sky a kiss and no goodbye)
That's all I want from you
Don't let me down oh show me
That's all I want from youWhen God dips His love in my heart
When God dips His pen of love in my heart
And He writes my soul a message He wants me to know
His spirit all divine, fills a sinful soul of mine
When God dips His love in my heart
Well, I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul
How He brought salvation and He made me whole
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart
Well, He made me laugh and He made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire
Hallelujah, when God dips His love in my heart, in my heart
Well, sometimes though the way is dreary, dark and cold
And some unburdened sorrow keeps me from the goal
I go to God in prayer, I can always find Him there
To whisper sweet peace to my soul
Well, I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul
How He brought salvation and He made me whole
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart
Well, He made me laugh and He made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire
Hallelujah, when God dips His love in my heart
He walked up every step of Calvary's rugged way
And He gave his life completely to bring a better day
My life was steeped in sin but in love He took me in
His blood washed away every stain
I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul
How He brought salvation and He made me whole
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart
He made me laugh and He made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire
Hallelujah, when God dips His love in my heart
Hallelujah, when God dips His love, His sweet love in my heartLeave me a lock of your golden hair leave a memory that we once shared
Leave me the twinkle in your eye leave me something to remember you by
Leave me a kiss as you walk out the door
For you know and I know you won't be back no more
Leave me a way as you say goodbye leave me something to remember you by
[ steel ]
Leave me a kiss...
Leave me something to remember you byWho'll walk me down to church when I'm sixty years of age
When the ragged dog they gave me has been ten years in the grave
And senorita play guitar, play it just for you
My rosary has broken and my beads have all slipped through
You've hung up your great coat and you've laid down your gun
You know the war you fought in wasn't too much fun
And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years on
Yes I'll sit with you and talk let your eyes relive again
I know my vintage prayers would be very much the same
And Magdelena plays the organ, plays it just for you
Your choral lamp that burns so low when you are passing through
And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years onI walked in
There said slim
Cleaning up his memory with
some sapphire gin
Mr. Paine grabbed my arm
Pulled me aside
And said kid are you ready for
the wild ride
I looked up
There she stood
I said if you didn't look so great
I'd say you look good
She took her hand
Ran it up my thigh
And said cowboy you ready for
the wild ride
Come on now junior take the wild ride
See can you make it on the wild ride
Don't try no shakin' on the wild ride
'Cause things start breakin' on
the wild ride
Layin' on the highway
I saw my mind
In tiny little pieces thrown from
side to side
My heart was shattered
along with my pride
Guess you can't keep 'em
the wild ride
Come on now junior take the wild ride
See can you make it on the wild ride
Don't try no shakin' on the wild ride
'Cause things start breakin' on
the wild ride
I was crawlin' 'cross the floor
I was trying to leave
When I felt something tuggin'
what was left of my sleeve
I heard a little voice with a
gold-plated vibe
Say I bought a ticket on the wild ride
Come on junior take the wild ride
See can we make it on the wild ride
Let's try to shake it on the wild ride
We might just break it on the wild ride
Come on junior take the wild ride
See can we make it on the wild ride
Let's try to shake it on the wild ride
We might just break it on the wild ride
Come on come on
Take me on the wild ride
See can you make me on the wild ride
Come on an' shake me on the wild ride
You might just break me on the wild rideI heard about these kids walkin' on a train track
Forty tons of steel bearing down on them
And they just turned their backs
Channel five, asked the one who survived
'Son, why'd you do such a thing?
No reply but his eyes cried
Peace, I just need some peace
If I have to I'll do anything
Don't need your love or your sympathy
But I cannot go on living without peace
I know a man who sits and stares
At a kitchen cabinet door
That hides a whiskey bottle
He hasn't touched since
Well, this is day four
He told his wife this time he'd try
As she was just about to leave
No reply, but her eyes cried
Peace, I just need some peace
If I have to I'll do anything
Don't need your love or your sympathy
But I cannot go on living without peace
I have a friend who's looking for God
A few good self-help books is as far as she's gotten
Say a prayer tonight for that desperate child
Say a prayer tonight for that man and his wife
Say a prayer for the searching, hurting
For the one thing we all need
If you don't know what to say
Just look up to heaven's face and whisper, 'Peace'I've been here a month or more stuck in this ol' city
Folks that have to call this home, they the ones I pity Lord I'm homesick
and blues are the only tunes I ever seem to pick
I go out and walk the streets 'til I get blisters on my feet
I'm southbound
[ banjo - dobro ]
I'm all right 'til late at night sittin' by my window
I count sheep but I can't sleep list'nin to that train blow I begin to pine
When I hear that great big engine rollin' down the line
I'm goin' back to spend some time where I can't fall when I ain't got a dime
I'm southbound
[ ac.guitar - harmonica ]
Southbound's burnin' the ground Lord I don't mean maybe
Sure am glad I caught this train; gonna see my baby Lord I'm lonesome
and I long to see those hills where I come from
Listen the engine's rattle 'n roar, carryin' me back home once more I'm southboundI remember wearing straight-legged Levi's
Flannel shirts even when they weren't in style
I remember singing with Roy Rogers at the movies
When the west was really wild
I was listening to the Opry when all my friends
Were diggin' rock & roll and rhythm and blues
I was country when country wasn't cool
I remember circlin' the drive-in
Pullin' up and turning down George Jones
I remember when no one was looking
I was putting peanuts in my Coke
I took a lot of kiddin' 'cause I never did fit in
Now look at everybody trying to be what I was then
I was country when country wasn't cool
I was country when country wasn't cool
I was country from my hat down to my boots
I still act and look the same
What you see ain't nothing new
I was country when country wasn't cool
They called us 'country bumpkins'
For stickin' to our roots
I'm just glad we're in a country
Where we're all free to choose
I was country when country wasn't cool
(George Jones)
I was country when country wasn't cool
I was country from my hat down to my boots
(Both)
I still act and look the same
What you see ain't nothing new
'Cause I was country when country wasn't cool
Yeah, I was country when country wasn't coolEverything is free now, that's what they say
Everything I ever done, gonna give it away
Someone hit the big score, they figured it out
They were gonna do it anyway, even if it doesn't pay
I can get a tip jar, gas up the car
Try to make a little change down at the bar
Or I can get a straight job, I done it before
Never minded workin' hard, it's who I'm workin' for
Everything is free now, that's what they say
Everything I ever done, gotta give it away
Someone hit the big score, they figured it out
They were gonna do it anyway, even if it doesn't pay
Every day I wake up, hummin' a song
But I don't need to run around, I just stay at home
And sing a little love song, my lover, myself
If there's something that you wanna hear, you can sing it yourselfLong John walkin' around in the rain
He's long gone Lost John
Long gone Lost John
No hat on his head no shoes on his feet
He's a beggin the women for his meat
I had an ol' dog and his name was
like a rabbit through Bowlin' GreenI know you loved him a long time ago
And even now in my arms you still want him I know
But darlin' this time let your memories die
When you hold me tonight don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes let it be me
Don't pretend it's him in some fantasy
Darling just once let yesterday go
And you'll find more love than you've ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes
Maybe I've been a fool holding on all this time
Lying here in your arms knowing he's in your mind
But I keep hoping someday that you'll see the light
Let it be tonight, don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes let it be me
Don't pretend it's him in some fantasy
Darlin' just once let yesterday go
And you'll find more love than you've ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes let it be me
And don't pretend it's him in some fantasy
Darlin' just once let yesterday go
And you'll find more love than you've ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And don't close your eyesYes you're the hardest part of livin's loving me
Must be thousands of good reasons that I may never see
Still you keep that candle burnin' let me live there in your dreams
You're the reasons for tomorrow you're the sunshine morning brings
I've got friends in lots of places and I'm quick to call their names
And I know you've got a lotta friends and you could do the same
I've got answers to that problem solutions they can't see
But you're hardest part of livin's loving me
I've got feelings for the man who's down and it hurts to see his pain
And I know that when you cry at night those tears like falling rain
But it's crying tears of hoping for the things you prayed to be
And you're hardest part of livin's loving me
Yes you're the hardest part...
You're the reasons for tomorrow you're the sunshine morning bringAlways there,
When my world starts closing in,
Something to hold,
No matter how long it's been.
Gets me high,
Then knocks me to the ground.
Soothes my mind,
And then begins to break me down.
Whiskey and you,
Ain't nothing I can do,
But come crawling back to,
Whiskey and you.
I never asked you to love me,
I never begged you to stay.
But I never want you to leave me,
I wouldn't have it any other way.
Whiskey and you,
Ain't nothing I can do,
But come crawling back to,
Whiskey and you.
As darkness finds the candle,
And the flame stops flickering,
Girl I know and I hope,
It won't be too long,
'Till we light it up again.
Whiskey and you,
Ain't nothing I can do,
But come crawling back to,
Whiskey and you.
Whiskey and you,
There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing I can do,
But I keep crawling, I keep coming back to.
Whiskey and you.It was seven hundred fenceposts from your place to ours
Neither one of us was old enough to drive a car
Sometimes it was raining, sometimes it would shine
We wore out that gravel road between your house and mine
I'd start walking your way
You'd start walking mine
We'd meet in the middle
'Neath that old Georgia pine
We'd gain a lot of ground
'Cause we'd both give a little
And their ain't no road to long
When you meet in the middle
It's been seven years tomorrow since we said our vows
Under that old pine tree, you ought to see it now
Standing in the back yard reminding me and you
That if we don't see eye to eye there's something we can do
I'd start walking your way
You'd start walking mine
We'd meet in the middle
'Neath that old Georgia pine
We'd gain a lot of ground
'Cause we'd both give a little
And their ain't no road to long
When you meet in the middle
Babe I love the way we work it out
That's what love's about
I'd start walking your way
You'd start walking mine
We'd meet in the middle
'Neath that old Georgia pine
We'd gain a lot of ground
'Cause we'd both give a little
And their ain't no road to long
When you meet in the middle
I'd start walking your way
You'd start walking mine
We'd meet in the middle
'Neath that old Georgia pine
We'd gain a lot of ground
'Cause we'd both give a little
And their ain't no road to long
When you meet in the middle
I'd start walking your way
You'd start walking mine
We'd meet in the middle
'Neath that old Georgia pine
We'd gain a lot of ground
'Cause we'd both give a little
And their ain't no road to long
When you meet in the middleI must have done something bad sometime in my life
And I paid for it time and again
But this time you've hurt me so bad I could lay down and die
And the pain grows each day, ten times ten times ten.
If I thought my hand was against you, why I'd cut off my arm
And I'd walk off and leave it behind
If I thought that you needed money, why I'd sell my own soul
And I'd even steal from the poor and the blind.
I can't understand how ice can glitter like fire
Why you had me fooled all alone
I gave you all that I had then I searched around for more
And now I've got nothing at all and you're gone.
I must have done something bad sometime in my life
And I paid for it time and again and againAnd I wake up in the mornin' with my hair down in my eyes and she says hi
And I stumble to the breakfast table while the kids're goin' off to school goodbye
And she reaches out and takes my hand and squeezes it and says how you feelin' hon
And I look across at smilin' lips that warm my heart and see my morning sun
And if that's not lovin' me then all I gotta say
God didn't make little green apples and it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
There's no such thing as Doctor Suess
Disneyland and Mother Goose is no nursery rhyme
God didn't make little green apples and it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when myself is feelin' low I think about her face aglow and ease my mind
Sometimes I'll call her up at home knowin' she's busy
And I'll ask her if she'd get away and come downtown and meet me
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me and I'm always late
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me
Cause she's made that way
And if that's not lovin' me then all I gotta say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes
There's no such think as make believe puppy dogs and autumn leaves and BB guns
God didn't make little green apples and it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when myself is feelin' low I think about her face aglow and ease my mindWell I like kiss every mornin' a kiss every night a whole mess of hugs in between
Cause lovin' is livin' and you ain't really livin' till you learn what lovin' can mean
And honey baby if you doubt me just give me the chance I'll try to show you it's true
That lovin' is livin' and sure's I'm livin' and fallin' in love with you
A lotta folks go to movies when the work is done to see what they can see
But when I go to movies I can have more fun stealin' kisses in the balcony
I'm askin' you baby won't please don't you try to see it the way that I do
And I'm hopin' and prayin' that soon you'll be sayin' that lovin' is livin' too
I'd like to tease you and tickle you the whole day through and now's the time to start
I'd give a gold faded nickel for kiss from you so come on baby open up your heart
I'm askin' you baby won't please don't you try to see it the way that I do
And I'm hopin' and prayin' that soon you'll be sayin' that lovin' is livin' tooShe's a buckskin baby made of silk and steel
Daughter of her Mother's heart
Well, dyed in the wool
Future farmer of a brand new start
She could've been a supermodel or a rich man's queen
Livin up on easy street
But the call of the wild
and the solid earth beneath her feet
Seemed to complete her
Let her see into her soul
To pastures greener
Where there's room enough to grow
Back to where the red fern knows
The sweetness of the mountain rose
And the land she laughs at all this wood and wire
We all outgrow the skin we're in
But we can weave, we will mend
Stitch by stitch, row by row
We're making sure there's room enough to grow
Leaves were blowing on the pumpkins fattening in the field
She saw a 'we got apples' sign
Turned down a road never knowing what she might find
He was sittin on his tractor when she caught his eye
He gave a wave and walked her way
He was all breath and britches hair the color of the sun on hay
Through winter's hunger
Spring and summer overflow
With love free to wander
where there's room enough to grow
Well, it's back to where the red fern knows
The sweetness of the mountain rose
And the land she laughs at all this wood and wire
We all outgrow the skin we're in
But we can weave, we will mend
Stich by stich, row by row
Making sure there's room enough to grow
Ohhhh ohhhhhh
Back to where the red fern knows
The sweetness of the mountain rose
And the land she laughs at all this wood and wire
We all outgrow the skin we're in
But we can weave, we will mend
Stich by stitch, row by row
Making sure there's room enough to grow(C.W. McCall, B. Fries, C. Davis)
Did you see me at Westport Landing
On the wide Missouri shore?
Did you hear the west wind calling
In the spring of forty-four?
[Chorus]
If the mud don't stay and the cattle don't stray
We can make Fort Kearny by the middle of May
If the mud don't stay and the cattle don't stray
We can make Fort Kearny by the middle of May
Did you see me at old Fort Kearny?
Did you hear my trumpets blow?
Did you write your name in stone, boys
On the great Platte River road?
[Chorus]
If the wolf don't howl in the dark of the moon
We can make Scotts Bluff by the middle of June
If the wolf don't howl in the dark of the moon
We can make Scotts Bluff by the middle of June
Did you see that endless prairie
Blowin' clean and pure and free?
Did you hear that rollin' thunder
On the wild Nebraska sea?
Did you climb the shining mountains?
Did you cross that Great Divide?
Did you pray to God Almighty
To let you down the other side?
[Chorus, but only by C.W.]
Roll wagons, rollin' rollin'
Roll wagons, rollin' home
Roll wagons, rollin' rollin'
Roll wagons, rollin' home
Did you see me out on the desert?
Did you see my oxen die?
Did you find a drop of water?
Did you hear my children cry?
[Chorus]
If the sun don't shine and the river don't rise
We can make South Pass by the fourth of July
If the sun don't shine and the river don't rise
We can make South Pass by the fourth of July
Did you see the high Sierra
Far beyond the burning sand?
Did you find that golden valley?
Did you reach the Promised Land?
[Chorus]
If the snow don't fly and the river don't dry
We can make that valley before we die
If the snow don't fly and the river don't dry
We can make that valley before we dieRidin' against the wind in East New Mexico
His skin is dry and worn as the Texas plains
He's headed where the air is thin and and the cold blue northers blow
Up through the Raton Pass but he'll have to beat the early snow
The winter of '64 was a great many years ago
When a young man went away for the rebel cause
And he was branded by the war and the only life he'd know
Was lookin' over his shoulder saddle bound and layin' low
Now there's a man on the goodnight-loving
Like too many other men out on the trail
Who found the hard way when the pushing comes to shoving
He'd go six feet under before he'd go to jail
Now there's a place just north of here where they say the outlaws go
Where a man can leave his name and past behind
And every now and then you'll hear, he's gone the way of the buffalo
And that he finally made the pass but he didn't beat the early snow
Now there's a man on the goodnight-loving
Like too many other men out on the trail
Who found the hard way when the pushing comes to shoving
He'd go six feet under before he'd go to jail
He'd go six feet under before he'd go to jailJump aboard that silver plane
Wave to me through that window pane
Left me with my arms full of empty.
Well, I'm so sick and tired of gettin' up
So sick and tired
Sick old dirty clothes and dirty dishes
I'm tired of all these sleepless nights
That drive me up to walls
Tired of having arms full of empty.
Oh, you took my car and took my money
Done me wrong and that ain't funny
Left me standing here a looking silly
Jump aboard that silver plane
(Wave to me through the window pane)
Left me with my arms full of empty.Flooded roads out of town
Call and telephone lines are down
I call and the lines are down
Retarded girl oh she slurs
Tornadoes out on the desert sir
Tornadoes out on the desert
And I'm going to El Paso
I'm going to El Paso
I'm going to El Paso
I'm going to
Chicken blood on my pants
My Hands are shaky and pillow is damp
My Hands are shaky and pillow is damp
Cigarette on a rumble seat

I'm Driving all day got nothing to get me to El Paso
I'm going to El Paso

Look out Juarez

Waiting on the bus to get me through
I'm waiting on the bus to get me to goin to El Paso
I'm going to El Paso
I'm going to El PasoWhen we go down to albany
All our problems will just be beginning but
Everything just might get better
When we finally get to where we're gonna go
Oh baby when go down to albany
Oh the headaches'll be so amazing cause
It's not easy to move your possessions
To a place so far away from home
Oh yeah we're workin' hard
On the redesign
We gotta talk
Till we get it just right
You understand
Cause it takes forever
And we can't leave nothin' behind
Oh no when we go down to albany
Don't you know we'll be startin' all over and
We got piles of old belongings
That we just can't bear to leave behind
Oh no no
When we go down to albany
Everything'll be so much easier
Maybe i'll be gone by then
Or maybe i'll get left along the way
Uh huh we're workin' hard
On the redesign
We gotta talk
Till we get it just right
You understand
Cause it takes forever
And we can't leave nothin' behind
Oh no when we go down to albany
Everything'll be so much easier
Maybe i'll be gone by then
Or maybe i'll get left along the wayBlue trail of sorrow
Lies upon the ground
And I get so lonely
Since you let me down
Well, I used to be so happy
Walkin' on these streets
Now there's just sadness
Everywhere I meet
Start walkin', baby, walk all over town
Sweet tears of sadness fallin' down
Keep lookin', baby, and I won't be around
Blue trail of sorrow on the ground
Now when I had a dollar
You'd stick right by me
Now I've got nothin'
But blues for company
Well, I think I'll leave tomorrow
I'm tired of this old town
But it won't be hard to find me
If you look down on the ground
Start walkin', baby, walk all over town
Sweet tears of sadness fallin' down
Keep lookin', baby, and I won't be around
Blue trail of sorrow on the groundI was down in the valley way down in the valley when the Saviour heard my feeble cry
Now I'm back up on the mountain way up on the mountain
Drinking from the fountain that never will run dry
Well there was darkness all around me when my Saviour found me
Way down in the valley of despair
But when I told him all my troubles my joys and he doubled
Now I'm back up on the mountain rejoicing in his care
Well I was down in the valle
If it don't watch old Satan he'll get you in the valley
And hide you from the Saviour's guiding light
But he will stay behind you and he will never find you
Way up on ther mountain if you fight a good fight
Well I was down in the valley
Yes I was down in the valley
Well I said I was down in the valleyA ghostly chorus]
Night rider
Well, a-truckin' on the night line, quarter past five
Tryin' to get my rig an' me to 'Frisco alive
Fog lights up tight, a-givin' me the creeps
Just a Winnemucca trucka with a load a' black sheep
[A ghostly chorus]
Night rider
I got a belly full a' jelly and head full a' pain
Bennies spinnin' spider webs, a-messin' my brain
Tryin' ta get myself together with a shot a' black see
What I really oughta get me is an hour a' Zs
[Chorus, but not ghostly]
Night Rider, Night Rider, losin' your mind
Look at those lights 'til you think you've gone blind
Night Rider, Night Rider, losin' your mind
Look at those lights, 'til you've gone blind
Well, Alabammy Mammy got a spell on my life
Kansas City Kitty cut my heart out tonight
I lost a see-note in Reno off a' Keno and craps
And now Smokey's on the overpass a-settin' his traps
White lines lasers burnin' holes in my eyes
Feel like I'm hypnotized, think I'm gonna die
Interstate 80, gonna get me no sleep
Just a-winkin' and a-blinkin' with a stinkin' load a' sheep
[Chorus]
Night Rider, Night Rider, losin' your mind
Look at those lights 'til you think you've gone blind
Night Rider, Night Rider, losin' your mind
Look at those lights, 'til you've gone blind
[A ghostly chorus]
Night rider
[Ghostly, but it's not the chorus]
Ba ba black sheep, have you any wool?
Yes sah, yes sah, three bags full
One for my master, and one for my dame
And one for Jimmy Bowen who lives in L.A.
[Chorus]
Night Rider, Night Rider, losin' your mind (yeah)
Look at those lights 'til you think you've gone blind
[Psychotic cackling here. He's losin' it.]
Night Rider, Night Rider, losin' your mind
Look at those lights 'til you think you've gone blind
Night Rider, Night Rider, losin' your mind
Look at those lights 'til you think you've gone blind

Look at those lights 'til you think you've gone blind

Night Rider, Night Rider, losin' your mind
Look at those lights 'til you think you've gone blind
Night Rider, Night Rider, losin' your mind
Look at those lights 'til you think you've gone blindYou come around most every night
Looking for my heart
Each time I turn out the light
I can count on you to start
Bringing back sweet memories
Of the love we made
You never change
You're a faithful old flame
I know you'll be here right on time
To tear me up again
You never stay away too long
And give me a chance to mend
Tears won't drown your fire in me
It's even worse when it rains
You never stray from a faithful old flame
Just when I think you're gone
You start the fire
And I yearn for your touch
That I miss so much
Embers of love glow even brighter
Than they did yesterday
They won't go away
I've tried my best to put you out
But the spark remains
It's still the same
You're a faithful old flame
You never stray you're a faithful old flameI called him for days, he didn't answer the phone
I drove by his house, I knew he was home
A week's worth of papers and mail in the box
I thought he was dead, I picked the lock
I found him in tears in the dark on his knees
With a hole in his chest where his heart used to be
And he said
Don't call the doctor, don't call the nurse
Call for the lady with the alligator purse
She knows the spell to lift this curse
Go find the lady with the alligator purse
In an old stone house off 21st
I found the lady with the alligator purse
She answered the door, said I know who you are
She lit a candle, consulted the stars
When I saw her closing that reptile's hide
I asked her point-blank, is my friend going to die
And she said
I'm not a doctor, I'm not a nurse
I'm just the lady with the alligator purse
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst
So said the lady with the alligator purse
She said, look at what happened to Cleopatra
When she didn't take my advice
And Romeo, Juliet, they didn't get it
Too bad, those kids were so nice
By the time we got back to my pitiful pal
There was no sign of life till he saw the alligator
Purse on her arm, the gleam in her eyes
She opened the bag, there was nothing inside
She said, there's no secret, it's love that I use
I just carry this bag because it matches my shoes
And she said
Don't call the doctor, don't call the nurse
Don't call the lady with the alligator purse
Love is the magic of the universe
Take it from the lady with the alligator purse
Love is the magic of the universe
Take it from the lady with the alligator purse
The lady with the alligator purseUnder the influence of love
She knew I knew that she was out to get me but I just close my eyes let it be
Now she walks by me like she never met me I didn't even make a memory
For I was under the influence of love I wonder now what I was thinking of
Yes I was so in love I let her hurt me though I knew better
Under the influence of love
Why did I let her do me like she done me why can't I get that woman off my mind
Although I know she never truly loved me I wish she break my heart just one time
For I was under the influence of loveA lonely town a lonely street a lonely room where I can't sleep
She's on my mind I think about her endlessly
He bought her big blue diamond rings a car and other costly things
But can't he buy the kind of love she gave to me
The kind of love she gave to me gave it so unselfishly
We planned a home all of our own now that can't be
He'll buy her furrs and silk and gowns she never had in Shantytown
But can't he buy the kind of love she gave to me
[ steel ]
She's from across the track you know where the bright lights never glow
In Shantytown we live and love so differently
She'll have her mansion on the hill but when that house is cold and still
Can't he buy the kind of love she gave to me
The kind of love she gave to me...We all came here for a party tonight
And your gonna get left if you don't get right child
So forget your troubles and forget the news
We're gonna pull the plug and black out them blues
And if your tie's to tight then adjust the noose
'Cause if your gonna hang tight cut loose
Tearin' it up
And we're burin' it down
Hey daddy's hide your daughters
'Till the sun come back around
'Cause we all came here to party
We came to come unwound
So go tell everybody that the boys are back in town
Just to tear it up
And to burn it down
We love to hear you stomp and sing
Just swamp a little southeast western swing thing
So just grab unto each other and let go
Make a little midnight moonlight mojo
When the magic happens let it all hang out
If you want to join the fun shout
Tearin' it up
And we're burin' it down
Hey daddy's hide your daughters
'Till the sun come back around
'Cause we all came here to party
We came to come unwound
So go tell everybody that the boys are back in town
Just to tear it up
And to burn it down
Tearin' it up
And we're burin' it down
Hey daddy's hide your daughters
'Till that sun come back around
'Cause we all came here to party
We came to come unwound
So go tell everybody that the boys are back in town
Just to tear it up
And to burn it down
We know you like to party
We know you like to throw it down
So go tell everybody
Let's get them all around
We're gonna tear it up
And burn it downWell I knew this town was headed for hell the day they tore down the hippy hotel. Mister Rogers said it was too far gone. Had to clear it away, commercialin zone. For a hundred years it stood the test of time, till they laid it down to rest in pieces that won't be joined again. When they clear away the wreck, they're gonna raise the roof on a disco tech, with mirror balls and woofers cranked to 10.
Well, there's something kinda strange about this street. When I walk it, I can feel it in my feet. Long ago, an old lady lived in a house with 40 cats and a freeze-dried spouse. Memories haunt that vacant lot, hangin in the trees like patchy fog. Late at night, they whisper in the wind. No one listens to the trees and they'll be gone soon wait and see. Once they're gone they won't come back again.I wish to the lord I'd never been born
Or died when I was young
I never would have seen your sparkling blue eyes
Or heard your lying tongue
All the good times are past and gone
All the good times are o'er
All the good times are past and gone
Little darling don't weep no more
Don't you see that turtle dove
That flies from pine to pine
He's mourning for his own true love
Just like I mourn for mine
Come back, come back my own true love
And stay awhile with me
For if ever I've had a friend in this world
You've been that friend to meWell we've had our troubles, we've had our hard times
Were some might have stumbled, we've always survived
Sometimes love weakens, when the chips are all down
But what we've got together gets stronger somehow
(bridge)
Pressure makes Diamonds much harder than stone
And they only get finer as each day goes on
We've been through some bad times but we made it somehow
'cause if pressure makes diamonds, our love's a diamond by now
Well we know the feelin' when the world closes in
We've been there before, love, and we might go again
The road may get rocky life may get hard
But the whole world together can't tear us apart
(repeat bridge)Sleep sweet and deep close my eyes with a smile
Sleep come over me let me rest and dream awhile
I want to dream of two young lovers holding hands
The dreams that I used to dream way back when
All the things that could and should've been before the eternal sadness set in
Sleep sweet and deep let me rest and dream awhile
Let me dream of the sunlight shining in her hair of the days with laughter in the air
Take me back to my world of happiness again before the eternal sadness set in
Sleep sweet and deep let me rest and dream awhile let me rest and dream awhileNobody uh uh uh but a fool uh uh uh would do uh uh uh the things I do
I worship you but you don't care to you
Still I keep calling back cause I'm that bigger fool over you uh uh uh
Even the wind and the rain all seem to say what a shame
To be a fool all your life but a fool I am and a fool I will remain
Nobody uh uh uh but a foolIt was a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre
Did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell
"C'est la vie", say the old folks
It goes to slow you never can tell
They furnished off an apartment
With a two room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed
With T.V. Dinners and ginger ale
But when Pierre found work
The little money comin' worked out well
"C'est la vie", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They had a hi-fi phono
Boy did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records
All rockin' rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down
The rapid tempo of the music fell
"C'est la vie", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They bought a souped-up Jimmy
T'was a cherry-red fifty three
Drove it down to Orleans
To celebrate their anniversary
It was there that Pierre
Was wedded to the lovely mademoiselle
"C'est la vie", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tellOnly you can make my dreams come true only you can turn my skies to blue
Love like ours should not be far apart only you can break my heart
Only you can end these sleepless nights only you can make things turn out right
You and you alone can keep us far apart only you can break my heart
Only you can break my heartIt had to be you it had to be you
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true could make me be blue
And even be glad just to be sad thinking of you
Some others I've seen might never be me
Might never be crossed or tried to be bossed but they wouldn't do
For nobody else gave me a thrill with all your faults I love you still
It had to be you wonderful you it had to be you
It had to be you...You say that love makes you act like a fool
Makes you silly, makes you lose your cool
If that's what it does to you
I'm a fool too
You daydream like an innocent child
Can't wait to do somethin' foolish and wild
If that's what it does to you
I'm a fool too
If you're a fool to give in so quickly
To feelings as strong and true
If you're a fool to surrender so easy
To somethin' that's bigger than you
Then I'm a fool too
You talk for hours on the telephone
Don't want to spend another night alone
If that's what it does to you
I'm a fool too
You catch yourself just singin' along
To all them old Barry Manilow songs
If that's what it does to you
I'm a fool too
If you're a fool to give in so quickly
To feeling as strong and true
If you're a fool to surrender so easy
To something that's bigger than you
I'm a fool tooSo Close Now
I've got the streets memorized
I see the faces embedded in my mind
I can't keep on fighting the urge go
I've got nothing in common with this town I've come to know
(So)
Chorus:
I am so close now to walking away
About to walk a path I've gotta take
I am packing up heading out
I can't sleep I'm dreaming way too loud
I'm so close now, so close now
to getting out
The same old lines, the same routine
Nothing changes and that's not good for me
I need a break. I need something new
I need to replace these old worn out broken shoes
(Cus)
I am so close now to walking away
About to walk a path I've gotta take
I am packing up heading out
I can't sleep I'm dreaming way too loud
I'm so close now, so close now
to getting out
I've got that truck all loaded down
I should've known how hard it'd be leave this town
I am....
So close now to walking away
About to walk a path I've gotta take
I am packing up heading out
I can't sleep I'm dreaming way too loud
I'm so close now, so close now
to getting out
[Thanks to Tanika for lyrics]If anyone could find the joy that true love brings a girl and boy
We could we could you and I
If anyone could ever say that their true love was here to stay
We could we could you and I
When you're in my arms I know you're happy to be there
Just as long as I'm with you I'm happy anywhere
If anyone could pray each night and thank the Lord that all is right
We could we could you and I
When you're in my armsIt's twelve o'clock again and here I am slowly driving home
To nothing but a big ole empty bed and another night alone
Before I left this evening I turned the lights down low and chilled some wine
I thought tonight would be the night someone would use that pillow next to mine
I went to church and got down on my knees and softly said a prayer
I listened for an answer but I didn't find it there
I looked in every honky-tonk in town and I searched the neon lights
But I can't find an angel to save my life
It seems that everyone I know has found someone to love and settle in
But I ain't settled nothing and it's killing me time and time againÃ¢?Â¦
I've been shot down in flames I've been stood up and I've been frozen out
I've been hurt but never felt as helpless as I'm feeling now.
I went to church...
Oh I need to find an angel to save my lifeWe got the ride, yeah, all gassed up and ready
We got the coolest cooler, chilling in the back of my Chevy
We got diamonds in the sky, silver moon shining on this road
We got hands in the air, wind in our hair, a party on the radio
We got the night right where we want it
We got the world wrapped around our fingers, girl
It sure feels good, don't it?
We gotta pour a little, jump on in
Don't think twice, what we've been waiting all morning
I got you, you got me
We got the night right where we want it
Yeah, it sure feels good, don't it?
Baby say left, and that's right where I'll be turning
Baby say right, alright, we'll get this back road burning
And we ain't gonna slow it down
'Til the sun comes creeping up
We got a good time and the headlights
And there ain't no stopping us
We got the night right where we want it
We got the world wrapped around our fingers, girl
It sure feels good, don't it?
We gotta pour a little, jump on in
Don't think twice, what we've been waiting all morning
I got you, you got me
We got the night right where we want it
We got diamonds in the sky
Yeah the time is on our side
And we got the night right where we want it
We got the world wrapped around our fingers, girl
It sure feels good, don't it?
We gotta pour a little, jump on in
Don't think twice, what we've been waiting all morning
I got you, you got me
And we got the night right where we want it
Oh, we got the night, we got the night, girl
Oh, right where we want itNo birds today
Just this square patch of gray
Molting sky moving in on its morning prey
No words today
No one knocking at the gate
I lost my name long before I lost my way
I wonder what he thinks out there
Pastures turn from black to green and black again
The sun it carves a well worn path
From here to there and the next day back
No birds today
Just this dull sky of gray
Winter's quickly moving in on its skulking prey
No dust today
No clouds rising from my driveway
No hope drifting slowly my way
I wonder what he thinks in there
Pastures turn from black to green and black again
The sun it carves a well worn path
From here to there and the next day back
Cold bars of steel
I'm beginning to dig the feel
Of all that disappears into....ethereal
Cold words of hate
Now I'm seeing how things break
Much too late now to cure my mistakes
I wonder what he thinks in there
Pastures turn from black to green and black again
The sun it carves a well worn path
From here to there and the next day back
No birds today
Just this barren stretch of gray
Just this barren stretch of grayAs I walk along,
I wonder what went wrong,
With our love,
A love so rarin' strong.
And as I walk along,
I think of the things we've done
Together, while our hearts were young.
I'm walkin' in the rain,
Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain,
Wishin' you were here by me,
To end this misery.
And I wonder
I wonder,
Why
Why, why, why, why, why
She ran away.
And I wonder,
Where she will stay
My little runaway.
Run, run, run, run, runaway.
I'm walkin' in the rain,
Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain,
Wishin' you were here by me,
To end this misery
And I wonder
I wonder,
Why
Why, why, why, why, why
She ran away.
And I wonder,
Where she will stay
Run, run, run, run, runaway.
Run, run, run, run, runaway.
Run, run, run, run, runaway.Today I sat alone at the window and I watched our little girl outside at play
With the little boy next door like so many times before
But something didn't seem quite right today
So I went outside to see what they were doing
And then the teardrops made my eyes go dim
Cause I heard him name a game and I hung my head in shame
When I heard our little girl say to him
I don't wanna play house I know it can't be fun
I watched mommy and daddy and if that's the way it's done
I don't wanna play house it makes my mommy cry
Cause when she played house my daddy said goodbye
I don't wanna play houseI wasn't ready for the avalanche when we let things slide
I'd always hoped that we would have the chance at least to say we tried
So I went siftin' though my old mistakes on the day you left
And I decided to forgive myself the heart can only take so much regret
You're all I'm achin' for and yet
I don't want this pain no more and yet
My heart won't lock that door
I wasn't ready for the avalanche
I wasn't ready for the words you chose when you said goodbye
Or just how suddenly the roads could close between your life and mine
So I went lookin' for the reasons why and I got so lost
And I decided I would have to try to live without your love at any cost
You're all I'm achin' for and yet
I don't want this pain no more and yet
My heart won't lock that door
And I wasn't ready for the avalanche
You're all I'm achin' for and yet
I don't want this pain no more I can't get
My heart won't lock that door
And I wasn't ready for the avalanche

(It's not the end of everything)
Just because my love has gone
Don't think my life would still go on
Because she wanted to have her fling
It's not the end of everything
The world still turns the sun still shines
There's plenty of girls for hearts like mine
One never knows what tomorrow might bring
It's not the end of everything
Just look at the things I still possess
Like a heart that's filled with emptiness
A life of pure unhappiness
Two arms that hold just loneliness
My rooms overflow with blue blue songs
I think of the nights I can spend all alone
And all of the days I can just sit and dream
It's not the end of everythingNow you may not feel like dancing
Or getting up at all
You may not be in the mood
To heed my beckoned call
When that guitar starts to get you
Squirming in your seat
Might as well just give it up
And get up on your feet
'Cause you can't sit still
When that music starts to play
No, you can't sit still
Oh, don't throw the urge away
And you can't sit still
When that music starts to play
Now you can't sit still
So don't throw the urge away
Just let that rhythm take you up
And out across that floor
Grab some [Incomprehensible] and boogie down
'Cause you can't sit still no more
Can't you feel it, Bill?
Oh, don't you know you can't sit still?
You were caught all week long now
And you know it's Friday night
You're gonna lay down your hard earned money
And you bought yourself a ride
So put your arm around her
And show her once again
What it was about your rock 'n' roll
She was a-grooving on way back when
'Cause you can't sit still
When that music starts to play
No, you can't sit still
Oh, don't throw the urge away
You can't sit still
When that music starts to play
No, you can't sit still
So don't throw the urge away
Just let that rhythm take you up
Out across that floor
Grab some [Incomprehensible] and boogie down
'Cause you can't sit still no more
Can't you feel it, Bill?
Oh, you know you can't sit still
Can't you feel it, Bill?
Oh, you know you can't sit still, oh yeahSomeday I'm gonna be famous, do I have talent well no
These days you don't really need it thanks to reality shows
Can't wait to date a supermodel, can't wait to sue my dad
Can't wait to wreck a Ferrari on my way to rehab
'Cause when you're a celebrity
It's adios reality
You can act just like a fool
People think you're cool
Just 'cause you're on TV
I can throw a major fit
When my latte isn't just how I like it
When they say I've gone insane
I'll blame it on the fame
And the pressures that go with
Being a celebrity
I'll get to cry to Barbara Walters when things don't go my way
And I'll get community service no matter which law I break
I'll make the supermarket tabloids, they'll write some awful stuff
But the more they run my name down the more my price goes up
'Cause when you're a celebrity
It adios reality
No matter what you do
People think you're cool
Just 'cause you're on TV
I can fall in and out of love
Have marriages that barely last a month
When they go down the drain
I'll blame it on the fame
And say it's just so tough
Being a celebrity
So let's hitch up the wagons and head out west
To the land of the fun and the sun
We'll be real world bachelor jackass millionaires
Hey hey Hollywood here we come
'Cause when you're a celebrity
It adios reality
No matter what you do
People think you're cool
Just 'cause you're on TVDarling I don't know much I know I love you so much
My life depends on your touch and my love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me it's soul deep
It's too big to hide and it can't be denied
My love is a river running soul deep soul deep
I work myself to death for ya just to show I adore ya
Nothing I wouldn't do for ya cause my love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me it's soul deep
Too big to hide
All I ever ever hope not be depends on your love for me
Baby believe me if you'd do leave me
I'd be nothing but an empty shell I know darn well
Darling I don't know muchMy life reminds me of everything I said it wouldn't be
It's kind of sad to believe shooting for perfection
Would backfire on me
Only one thing left to try
I'm reaching for the white flag 'cause I'm
Ready to surrender
I can't do this by myself
My truth became a joke
But it ain't so funny from the end of my rope
It gets bad, hell, I never knew
When you hit the bottom you've got more fallin' to do
Not quite ready to hope
Still gettin' used to lettin' go
But I'm ready to surrender
I can't do this by myself
I'm hard-headed and it's hard for me to ask for help
I'm ready to surrender
I can't do this by myself
I'm hard-headed and it's hard for me to ask for help
I've lost everything and I've fought this long enough to
Know there ain't no winner
So I'm givin' up, 'cause I'm strong enough to surrenderAll of me loves all of you
Every part of me
Down to the heart of me
Loves you through and through
Now wanting you it's all I do
All of my loves all of you
O' I have hear those tender words
But my heart wasn't listenin'
Till I found you I never knew
Just what I was missin'
O' I have hear those tender words
But my heart wasn't listenin'
Till I found you I never knew
Just what I was missin'
All of me loves all of youEvery day, along about evening
When the sunlight's beginning to pale
I ride through the slumbering shadows
Along the Navajo Trail
When it's night and crickets are callin'
And coyotes are makin' a wail
I dream by a smoldering fire
Along the Navajo Trail
I love to lie and listen to the music
When the wind is strummin' a sagebrush guitar
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin'
It always finds me wishin' on a star
Well what a ya know, it's mornin' already
There's the dawnin', so silver and pale
It's time to climb into my saddle
And ride the Navajo Trail
I love to lie and listen to the music
When the wind is strummin' a sagebrush guitar
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin'
It always finds me wishin' on a star
Well what a ya know, it's mornin' already
There's the dawnin', so silver and pale (like a silvery veil)
It's time to climb into my saddle(Dolly Parton)
The word "If", just two tiny letters
Says so much for something so small
The biggest little word in existence;
Never answers, just questions us all
If regrets were gold, I'd be rich as a queen
If teardrops were diamonds, how my face would gleam
If I'd loved you better, I wouldn't be lonely
If only, if only, if only
But looking back now I see clearly
With my twenty-twenty hindsight
Oh, but don't think I haven't paid dearly,
'Cause you could be in my arms tonight
If regrets were gold, I'd be rich as a queen
If teardrops were diamonds, how my face would gleam
How I let you go, I swear is beyond me
But if only; ah, if only; oh, if only
I could start over, if I could go back
Have the power to change things
Then I would do that
But I listened to others like a fool,
Oh, shame on me
But if only you would just come back
If only, dare I even ask
Oh, if onlyBecause your bad of the heart
How could you be so cruel
You treat me like a fool
After all I did for you
You cut me like a blade
My trust is slowly fading
Now I don't know what to do
I thought that when you gave me love
My life would start to change
Instead I saw that I was wrong
My life was re-aranged
How I wonder why
You just put my love aside
You threw me in the gutter and you left me there to lie
You never wanted to start
Cause your just bad of the heart
You never played the game to smart
Cause you know your bad
When I was by your side
You kissed and told me lies
You hurt me each and everyday
I made it through the night
Lying to myself, why did it have to be this way
I thought that when you gave me love
My life would start to change
Instead I saw that I was wrong
My life was re-aranged
How I wonder why
You just put my love aside
You threw me in the gutter and you left me there to lie
Bad of the heart
You never wanted to start
Cause your just bad of the heart
Now your tearing me apart
Bad of the heart
You never wanted to start
Cause your just bad of the heart
You really didn't want me baby, oh girl
Bad of the heart
You didn't really want me baby
You never really needed me
Cause your just bad of the heart
(Repeat)Now I'm a fellow with a heart of gold
With the ways of a gentleman I've been told
A kind of a fellow that wouldn't even harm a flea
But if me and a certain character met
That guy that invented the cigarette
I'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree
That ain't that I don't smoke myself
And I don't reckon they'll injure your health
I've smoked 'em all my life and I ain't dead yet
But nicotine slaves are all the same
At a pheasant party or a poker game
Everything's gotta stop when they have that cigarette
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette
Puff puff puff
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
Now at a game of chance the other night
Ol' Dame Forson wasn't doin' me right
Them kings and queens just kept on comin' round
Well I got a full and I bet it high
But my plug didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept a risin' and a layin' that money down
He's raise me and I'd raise him
I sweated blood I had to sink or swim
He finally called and he didn't raise the bet
I said "aces is full pal how about you?"
He said "I'll tell you in a minute or two
But I just gotta have another cigarette"
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette
Puff puff puff
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
The other night I had a date with
The cutest gal in the fifty states
A high bred uptown social little dame
She said she loved me and it seemed to me
That things were like they ought a be
So hand in hand we strolled down Lover's Lane
She was oh so far from a chunk of ice
And our smoochin' party was a goin' real nice
So help and I think I'd of been there yet
But I give her a hug and a little squeeze
And she said "Willie excuse me please
But I just gotta have another cigarette"
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette
Puff puff puff
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette
Puff puff puff
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
Just gotta have another cigaretteYou may be wealthy with more than your share
You may be able to go anywhere
You may have a kingdom and sit on a throne
But you'll still be lonely if you live alone
You may follow the bright lights with a smile on your face
You may travel this whole world and not get any place
A man needs a woman to stick by his side
One who who'll be faithful and much out of his pride
Until you'll find her all the dreams you have known
Will never come true while you live alone
Until you'll find her[ with Don Rich ]
Long distance information give me Memphis Tennessee
Help me find the party try to get in touch with me
She could not leave her number but I know who placed the call
Cause my uncle took the message and he wrote it on the wall
Help me operator get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd call me here from Memphis Tennessee
Her home is on the southside high up on a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge
[ guitar ]
The last time I saw Marie she was a waving me goodbye
With hurry home drops on her cheeks that trickled from her eyes
We were torn apart because her mom would not agree
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee
Help me operator more than this I cannot add
Only that I miss her so and all the fun we had
Marie is only six years old information please
Help to put me through to her in Memphis TennesseeYou told me you don't love me, when you walked out the door
I stood there feelin' lonely, then the tears began to pour
What else could I do, I'd never felt like that before
So I cried an ol' blue river in the middle of the floor
[Chorus]
Now I'm up to my ears in tears
I'm cryin' night and day since you went away
The things you used to say, honey, I no longer hear
That water's cold and clear, I'm drownin' for you dear
Up to my ears in tears
Well I found some old love letters you wrote me years ago
But the words all ran together when the tears began to flow
Cause you left that water runnin' now it's got nowhere to go
If I can't wash away your memory well I'll just go under slow
[Chorus]Sun's goin' down, it's still a hundred an' three.
Drivin' 'cross the desert, down Highway fifteen.
There's no turnin' back now, got all that we need.
To a desert oasis, we're travelin', my baby an' me.
We're goin' to the Little Chapel,
On the Las Vegas strip,
Where the preacher looks like Elvis;
We could even strike it rich.
Life is a gamble,
But our love's a sure bet.
Goin' to the Little Chapel,
On the Las Vegas strip.
Instrumental break.
Car's broken down, the side of the road,
How we got this far, God only knows.
Sold everything, don't need luxury.
Been livin' on good lovin', my baby an' me.
We're goin' to the Little Chapel,
On the Las Vegas strip,
Where the preacher looks like Elvis;
We could even strike it rich.
Life is a gamble,
But our love's a sure bet.
Goin' to the Little Chapel,
On the Las Vegas strip.
Life is a gamble,
But our love's a sure bet.
Goin' to the Little Chapel, (Goin' to the Little Chapel.)
On the Las Vegas strip.
Goin' to the Little Chapel,
On the Las Vegas strip.Spanish version (original)
Amapola, lindsima Amapola,
Sera siempre mi alma tuya sola.
Yo te quiero, amada nia mia,
Igual que ama la flor la luz del dia.
Amapola, lindsima Amapola,
No seas tan ingrata y mame.
Amapola, Amapola,
Como puedes tu vivir tan sola.
English lyrics (1940) by Albert Gamse
Amapola, my pretty little poppy,
You're like the lovely flower so sweet and heavenly.
Since I found you my heart is wrapped around you,
And, seeing you, it seems to beat a rhapsody.
Amapola, the pretty little poppy
Must copy its endearing charms from you.
Amapola, Amapola,
How I long to hear you say "I love you."You give your hand to me
And then you say hello
And I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
But you don't know me
No you don't know the one
Who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips
Longs to hold you tight
Oh I am just a friend
That's all I've ever been
'Cause you don't know me
I never knew the art of making love
No my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy I let my chance go by
The chance that you might love me too
You give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
Oh you will never know
The one who loves you so
Well you don't know meDon't expect a twirl
She's not that kind of girl
She reserves the right to be sullen
In a purple mood
Yeah she still thinks it's cool
So don't even try to tell her nothin'
Ooh she ain't gonna let you in
Fool she ain't ever gonna break her
Rule and if you try you're just another
Fool
She can feel your stare
And knows you're standing there
Waiting for a chance to win her favor
But she just sips her wine
As you get in line
With all of the others trying to save her
Ooh she ain't gonna let you in
Fool she ain't ever gonna break her
Rule and if you try you're just another
Fool
I know it's hard to resist
The taste of her kiss
But remember this
She won't let down her guard no matter what you do
Ooh she ain't gonna let you in
Fool she ain't ever gonna break her
Rule and if you try you're just another
FoolHe laid his deepest feelings down before her
He showed her all the corners of his heart
He gave her all the dreams his life had woven
And in her hands he watched them fall apart
-------
He wrapped her in his vision of perfection
The burden proved too much for her to take
She couldn't wear the halo that he gave her
She couldn't go on hiding each mistake
-------
CHORUS:
Now the spell is badly broken
There are no angels after all
There's only people, lonely people
And a million ways to fall
-------
She left him with a note of measured sorrow
She thought she would be cruel to be kind
But he has problems trying to forget her
Her memory walks the shadows of his mind
-------
REPEAT CHORUS:
A million promises to break
A million liberties to take
A million feelings to fake
And a million ways to fall
Music-------
Now the spell is badly broken
There are no angels after all
There's only people, lonely people
And a million ways to fall
Fading with the Music ....
Now the spell is badly broken
There are no angels after all
There's only people, lonely people
And a million ways to fall
Fades Out......
Now the spell is badly broken
There are no angels after all
There's only people, lonely people
And a million ways to fallI know the damage that he's done
And I know the damage that he'll do
I know when you knock on my door
I'll always open it to you.
There is a time, there is a place
But it's not here and now's not safe
So don't take more than I can give
And leave my heart out of this.
CHORUS:
You leave my heart out of this
You're too much to resist
I don't have the strength to pull away
No is getting hard for me to say
I'd love to be the way your heartache ends
But till it does we can't be more than friends
I'm only trying to do what's best
It's gonna hurt you more unless
You leave my heart out of this.
I know confused is how you feel
Afraid to make it on your own
I know the way your hurt to heal
And I know the empty of alone
So take my shoulder take my hand
Take what you need I'll understand
Just don't take more than I can give
And leave my heart out of this.Me and Billy Joe and Mary Beth
Were raised up on the path
Of righteousness
Made a solemn vow that
We'd always be close
And never wander far from
Sawmill Road
As the years went by
The world began to change
One by one we outgrew
Those childhood games
Momma cooked and cleaned
And worried 'bout our souls
We got into beer and cars
And rock 'n' roll
[Chorus]
We knew Jesus was the answer
And Elvis was the king
Blue Suede Shoes and Rock of Ages
Were the songs we learned to sing
Innocence went out of style
And we just watched it go
Yesterday got left beneath
The dust on Sawmill Road
Billy Joe went to Saigon
For Uncle Sam
Now I go to see him,
He don't know who I am
Once a year I get a card
From Mary Beth
She's with husband number four
Somewhere out west
I still live in this old house
Where we were raised
On this red dirt road
The county never paved
Now I watch my kids
And worry 'bout their souls
And pray they'll never wander
Far from Sawmill Road
[Chorus]
Me and Billy Joe and Mary Beth
Were raised up on the path
Of righteousness.When I come home at night
I find him sitting there
Looking at the paper
In my favorite chair
He's drinking up my coffee
Wearing my house shoes
He's the fellow they call Mr. Blues
Since you went away
He's been living here with me
Wish that he'd go home
Wherever that may be
I don't mean to be unkind
But he's got nothing I can use
So won't you come on back, sweetheart
And run off Mr. Blues
Now when I go to bed
Into my room he creeps
Repeating all the gossip
He's picked up on the street
All through the night he tells me
That things they say you do
He knows that I still love you
And I hate this kind of news
But since you went away
He's been living here with me
Wish that he'd go home
Wherever that may be
I don't mean to be unkind
But he's got nothing I can use
So won't you come on back, sweetheart
And run off Mr. BluesKnowing you stand by me through good and bad
Makes all the difference in my life
And day by day sweetheart I find
These are the ties that bind
The little things you do that please me so
The way you always understand
When simple joys bring peace of mind
These are the ties that bind
You're all I need
To see me through
Can I say more than this my love
I live just for your kiss my love
And I live just for your kiss my love
Forever and a day my love will live
The flame of love will never die
So heart and soul please say you're mine
Held by the ties that bindSometimes I want to throw my arms around you
Then I tremble at the thought of giving in
Because I know how much it cost to love you
And I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you revives the sorrow
That wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow
But I'm so afraid of losing you again
If heaven were to hear my heart's confession
Wanting you would be my greatest sin
But I'm glad that you're no longer my possession
'Cause I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you revives the sorrow
That wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow
But I'm so afraid of losing you againI saw you coming, you saw me
And took off running
Shells in your eyes,
What such sweet disguise
I wonder why, you never try
To understand a heart like mine
Whoa I didn't waste the time
'Cause a love, so hard to find
So is what you see
You're in love, belong to me
Oh I, I wonder why, you never try
To understand a heart like mine
Oh I, I wonder why, you never try
To understand a heart like mine
Whoa I wonder why, you never try
To understand a heart like mine
A heart like mine, a heart like mine
A heart like mine,
A heart like mine
A heart like mine, a heart like mine
A heart like mine, a heart like
A heart, a heart like
A heart, a heart like
A heart, a heart, a heart like mineI've been throwing horseshoes over my left shoulder
I've spent most all my life searching for that four leaf clover
Yet you run with me chasing my rainbows
Honey I love you too and that's the way love goes
That's the way love goes babe that's the music God made
For the whole wide world to sing it never gets old it grows
Losing makes me sorry you say honey now don't you worry
Don't you know I love you too and that's the way love goes
That's the way love goes babe.Every time I see a woman on a billboard sign
I think about you
Saying "drink this beer and you'll be mine"
I think about you
When an actress on a movie screen
Plays Lolita in some old man's dreams
It doesn't matter who she is
I think about you
When I see a pretty woman walking down the street
I think about you
Men look her up and down like she's some kind of treat
I think about you
She wouldn't dare talk to a stranger
always has to be aware of the danger
it doesn't matter who she is
I think about
You eight years old
big blue eyes and a heart of gold
when I look at this world, I think about
You and I can't help but see
that every woman used to be
Somebody's little girl, I think about you
Every time I hear people say it's never gonna change
I think about you
Like it's some kind of joke, some kind of game
I think about you
When I see a woman on the news
who didn't ask to be abandoned or abused
it doesn't matter who she is
I think about
You eight years old
big blue eyes and a heart of gold
when I look at this world, I think about
You and I can't help but see
that every woman used to be
Somebody's little girl, I think about you
When I look at this world I think about youI left the house about 8pm
Spent a little time with the boys again
I didn't really wanna be away from you
I went for one but I stayed 'til two
I played a little eight ball, made a few bucks
Dropped a little change in that old jukebox
Time flew by, next thing I knew
I went for one but I stayed 'til two
It was last call for alcohol
Billy got mean and he wanted to brawl
Old Jim Bob he was under the table
He wanted me to drive, I was barely able
Well, a pretty little blond there took my keys
Said, "Here have a cup of this coffee please"
I knew I'd have some explaining to do
Should have went for one but I stayed 'til two
When I got home I was quiet as a mouse
Little did I know you would move the couch
I hit the floor and the whole house knew
I went for one but I stayed 'til two
It was last call for alcohol
Billy got mean and he wanted to brawl
Old Jim Bob he was under the table
He wanted me to drive, I was barely able
I didn't really wanna be away from you
I went for one but I stayed 'til two
Went for one but I stayed 'til twoAnd I wake up in the mornin'
With my hair down in my eyes and she says, "Hi"
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are goin' off to school, goodbye
And she reaches out and takes my hand and squeezes it
Says, "How you feelin', hon?"
And I look across at smilin' lips
That warm my heart and see my morning sun
And if that's not lovin' me then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
There's no such thing as Doctor Seuss
Disneyland and Mother Goose is no nursery rhyme
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when myself is feelin' low
I think about her face aglow to ease my mind
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy
And ask her if she could get away and meet me
And grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doing
And hurries down to meet me and I'm always late
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me
Cause she's made that way
And if that's not lovin' me then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes
There's no such think as make believe
The puppy dogs and autumn leaves and the BB guns
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when myself is feeling low
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind
She keeps on loving youWell here I am in Chicago all alone near the place where we met
I walk through the rain the wind whispers your name oh why won't they let me forget
Cause when the wind blows I get lonely and one day for sure you left behind
But the wind always blows in Chicago so I'm lonely most all of the time
Folks looks so happy on State Street they don't know that our love's not the same
There's a crowd all around but I don't hear a sound
Just the wind when it whispers your name
And when the wind blows I get lonely and one day for sure you left behind
But the wind always blows in Chicago so I'm lonely most all of the time
Yes I'm lonely most all of the timeWe're living in the golden age of pain
The golden age of pain
There's a wind blowing through my door
And it's never been this cold before
It's the golden age of pain
I tell you that the golden age is here
Everybody's drowning on the tidal wave of tears
And on the little ball in space
Can't nobody win a human race
When the golden age is here
We got to have love, we got to have peace
We got to have trust out on the street, baby
Until the broken hearts all mend
How we ever gonna find the end
Of the golden age of pain
We're living in the golden age of pain
Rich man, poor man, beggar man it's all the same
Because the body don't take the blow
It's the soul of a man that gets laid low
In the golden age of painToo many nights I've been awake
We both so lonely, we don't know what to say
It's hard to hold on to a dream
When the sacrifice is hurting you and me
I hear your voice on the line
Sounds so sweet, I feel like mine
I miss my home
Everything I'm living for is not where I come from
I'll carry on and I'm back in the arms of the one love
'Cause I miss my home
Hope don't come easy, faith is hard to find
It's been so long since I had some peace of mind
The only thing that makes me [Incomprehensible]
Lord, my angel waiting there for me tonight
I miss my home
Everything I'm living for is not where I come from
I'll carry on and I'm back in the arms of the one love
'Cause I miss my home
I miss my home
Everything I'm living for is not where I come from
I'll carry on and I'm back in the arms of the one love
'Cause I miss my home
Oh, I miss my homeYes your love put a song put a song put a song in my heart
Never have I heard this beautiful music before
Yes your love put a song put a song put a song in my heart
A beautiful song of two people in love evermore
It wasn't too long ago I thought I would never know
What reason has anyone to sing a happy song
I knew only loneliness but then I found happiness
And now I just want the world to smile and sing along
Yes your love put a song...
[ guitar ]
The meaning of life I find is you in my heart and mind
The meaning that only comes when two hearts beat as one
It's easy to understand once you've given love your hand
And followed through paradise the way that we have done
Yes your love put a song...
Yes your love put a song...The old man got to feelin' bad
In the middle of the night
His grandson got up out of bed
And lit the coal oil light
He sat there and held his hand
Till his grandpa felt alright
And then he tucked him back in bed
And kissed his wrinkled brow goodnight
[Chorus]
Now that's love, real love
Every once in a while
When someone goes the extra mile
I'll bet God smiles and says, "Now that's love"
A father told his eight year old
Son, I'll have to miss you game today
I've got to fly to Houston
The boss says there's a deal that just can't wait
The young boy tried to hide his tears
But his dad could feel his pain
And he knew he'd have to tell the boss
My son comes first, I've got to make that game
[Chorus]
A young girl told her mother
I can't raise this child alone
He said he would marry me
But this note says he's gone
Her mother pulled her close and said
"Honey, I can't judge what's right or wrong
But as long as there's a breath of life in me
Your child will have a home"
[Chorus]I've been ramblin' out Montana way
Tryin' to live on a cow punchers pay
Been changin' them dams in the new summer hay
Irrigating alfalfa for six bucks a day
I'll tell you my story I'd be on my way
But the savings are slow to come on six bucks a day
Out here in the fields while the water runs down
With the sun high above me and the sky all around
I'm dreamin' my dreams of the Canada line
And the places I'd go if the money was mine
I'll tell you my story...
Come Saturday night well you draw out some pay
Then you go into town just to throw it away
And when the end of the month comes rolling your way
Well you ain't got much left on six bucks a day
I'll tell you my story...
Now if I drew out my time and I paid off my debts
I couldn't get to Great Falls on what I have left
But I've got me no choice when them diesel horns blow
Come a wind from the highway I got to pack up and go
Yeah money or none at all they can't hold me this way
For my blankets are rolled and tied and I'm leavin' todayWhen I was young back on the farm I could hardly wait
Till Sunday came and my true love would meet me by the gate
And we'd go roamin' through the countryside walkin' in the clover
Making love and playing games to warm winds of summer
Roamin' through the countryside walkin' in the clover
Making love and playing games to warm winds of summer
We'd stop and pick the daffodills when we talked awhile
And when I asked her for a kiss she'd look at me and smiled
And we'd go roamin'...
When the sun was sinking low we'd leave the fields behind
To think about another day for it was summer time
And we'd go roamin'...
Those carefree days have come and gone and now she is my bride
And every Suday afternoon I take her by my side
And we go roamin'...The nights get mighty lonesome out here on the road
Pickin' this old guitar a thousand miles from home
The songs tonight I'm singin' Lord they nearly make me cry
Take me back to old Wyoming and the lady with the emerald eyes
Take me back to old Wyoming I've been away too long
I want to hear the meadow lark singin' this cowboy's favorite song
I want to saddle up old paint and just ride him out across the hills
I belong in old Wyoming and I reckon that I always will
Everytime that I pack my suitcase it gets harder to drive away
The look that I see in my little girls eyes is beggin' me to stay
And I get that lonesome feeling before I'm even gone
But with everyday that passes I'm gettin' closer to goin' home
Take me back to old Wyoming...My country tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty
Of thee I sing
Land where my fathers died
Land of the pilgrim's pride
From every mountain side
Let freedom ring
My native country, thee
Land of the noble free
Thy name I love
I love thy rocks and rills
Thy woods and templed hills
My heart with rapture fills
Like that above
Let music swell the breeze
And ring from all the trees
Sweet freedom's song
Let mortal tongues awake
Let all that breathe partake
Let rocks their silence break
The sound prolong
Our Father God to, Thee
Author of liberty
To Thee I sing
My country 'tis of Thee
Sweet land of liberty
For all eternity
Let freedom ring
Let freedom ring
My country 'tis, my country 'tis of TheeI think I'll lay down on the banks of the corners of my mind
Send my mem'ries and dreams for a walk
While I listen to the sunset as it hides behind the mountain
Give the clouds in the sky a chance to talk
And make friends with a world that I daydream and love in
And shake hands with the freedom at my feet
Yes I will lay me down and let me breathe the ripples of the water
Flowing from a little mountain creek
And tell the world what I think of it and holler out I love you
And chase a little butterfly with some little boy or girl
A running barefoot on the concrete of this beautiful creation
Hot diggety dog hot diggety world hot diggety dog hot diggety world
[ guitar + steel ]
I'll pick the petals of a daisy that says everybody loves me
And no one can do me wrong along the way
And I'll stretch out my arms say I'm glad that I was born
And make everyday a day like today
Yes I'll make music with the birds and the bees in the forest
And consider every raindrop a pearl
And just for a while I'll set me free of myself and love this ole hot diggety world
Hot diggety dog hot diggety world hot diggety dog hot diggety world
Hot diggety dog hot diggety world hot diggety diggety diggety dog hot diggety worldI'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
Be white
Mmm mmm
Mmm be whiteLove was burning like the summer
We were lost in one another
Holding on, holding on
We could not escape the heat
Love was dangerous but sweet
And it was strong
Now you're talking 'bout your freedom
What is that you say?
You suddenly declared to me
Your independence day
Caught me by surprise
Fog turning to ice
Well it ain't even cold, baby
How could it snow in July?
Well, you led me to believe that
You found everything you needed
In my arms for so long
I thought everything was fine
Now you're turning on a dime
And moving on, moving on
Now I should have brought my sweater
For a chill is in the air
There's a sudden change of weather
For which I am not prepared
Caught me by surprise
Fog turning to ice
Well it ain't even cold, baby
How could it snow in July?
Well, I should have brought my sweater
For a chill is in the air
There's a sudden change of weather
For which I am not prepared
Caught me by surprise
Fog turning to ice
Well, it ain't even cold, baby
How could it snow in July?Good mornin' foreman, good mornin' boss
Do you need another mule skinner
With a blacksnake whip to toss
Yodel lay, ee ee, ay ee ee
Lord, I been workin' hard
And I feel so bad!
I've got a good woman
And I want to keep her glad
Yodel lay, ee ee, ay ee ee
I'm an ol' mule skinner, down Kentucky way
I can make any mule listen
Or I won't accept your pay
Yodel lay, ee ee, ay ee ee eeTake me to the river
And we'll watch the water roll
Take me in your warmth
And you'll fill my empty soul
Come on and take me, take me, take me
Come on and take me, take me, take me
Take me to the ocean
Where the water never run
Take me in your love
And I'll be your lifetime friend
Come on and take me, take me, take me
Come on and take me, take me, take me
Take me to the storm
Where the thunder meets the light
Take me in your gentle arms
And I'll love you through the night
Come on and take me, take me, take me
Come on and take me, take me, take meWell I was out a drinking with a couple of friends of mine
When the bartender handed me the telephone
And said there's my wife on the line
Well I told her I was just a drinking with the couple of biddies I knew
But she told me in a few short words just what she wanted me to do
She said won't you come home and talk to a stranger
You might even make yourself a friend
So won't you come home and talk to a stranger
It's the only place in days you haven't been
[ piano - guitar ]
Well I sat there about an hour a talking with the rest of the guys
When she walked to that front door she had gethome in her eyes
She said you've talked and danced with every woman in town but me
If you just come around the house you might like my company
She said won't you come home...
It's the only place in days you haven't beenDidn't I try hard enough to understand your ways
Didn't I stay strong enough through all our stormy days
Like I'd be clinging to our little house so close were you and I
Then came the day you just walked away and I lost you didn't I
Didn't I kiss you often enough didn't I hold you tight
And didn't I say I love you each time we kissed goodnight
Darling please tell me what I didn't do cause I tried so hard to make you see
But above everything in this world you were all that was meant for me
And you know I've thought I was all that you wanted in fact you've told me so
But I guess I failed somewhere along the way and just where I'd give my life to know
Like I'd be clinging to our little house so close were you and I
Then came the day you just walked away and I lost you didn't II can still see that lonesome road stretched out before me
The road that left me out of his love
I can still feel the tears he cried on my shoulder the day that I told him goodbye
I never should have left him never should have gone oh what a crazy fool I've been
Will he be waiting for me he will be won't he and will he take me back again
Shadows from the streets shade the path that I am walking
As I make my way back up that winding road again
And the smell of my tomorrow fills the air with sweet perfume
My heart beats faster as I'm near my journey're end
I wonder if he's missed me I wonder if he wants me I wonder does he love me still
Will he be waiting for me he will be won't he oh how I hope he will
He will be waiting for me he will be won't he
How could it be his love for me has faded and has died
He will be waiting for me he will be won't he
Oh will I find that this time I'll be the one to cry
Will he be waiting for meI shouldn't be missin? you
It makes no sense
Should be wearing, 'I'm over you' boots
And goin? dancin?
I'm having one of those
One of those days
God knows, I've had a few
But I know that it?s temporary
I've got a good life now
But every once in a while
I have a little breakdown
It ain't no big thing
I?ll be driving along
And hear a song we used to sing
And get lost, yeah, I have to stop
'Cause I get all caught up in the sound
I have a little breakdown
I think it?s over and done
Then I lose control
But when you've given your heart to someone
It?s inevitable
The first thing you never learn about love
Is that you never really let it go
I'm a walking contradiction
I've got a good life now
But every once in a while
I have a little breakdown
It ain't no big thing
I?ll be driving along
And hear a song we used to sing
And get lost, yeah, I have to stop
'Cause I get all caught up in the sound
I have a little breakdown
Breakdown, have a little breakdown
I lose sleep but hey
I can always catch up the next day
A few tears, everyone needs a good cry
Now and then, anyway, yeah
I've got a good life now
But every once in a while
I have a little breakdown
It ain't no big thing
I?ll be driving along
And hear a song we used to sing
And get lost, yeah, I have to stop
'Cause I get all caught up in the sound
I have a little breakdown
I shouldn't be missin? you
It makes no sense
Should be wearing I'm over you boots
And going dancin?When the boy was no more than a shaver
His old man told many a tale
How his great grandad used to go drovin'
Back and forth on the Oachezown Trail
Now you might say the boy got infected
By a fantasy of the old west
For his heart and his soul got connected
To a spirit that won't let him rest
Now he don't wear spurs that go jingle
He don't spend his nights round a fire
He lifts diesel oil that is horses required
But he is a latter day cowboy
Dressed as a truck driving man
Driving his wheels
And his dreams to Cheyenne
He beds down by the side of the highway
At the sight of the first evening star
In the darkness his big pony idles
As he quietly strums his guitar
And he sings out a song of his sweetheart
Even as her sweet mem'ry grows dim
And he sings of the trail he has chosen
But the actual fact is the trail chose him
Now he don't wear spurs that go jingle
Yes he is a latter day cowboy
Driving his wheels
And his dreams to CheyenneYou made up your mind it was over
After we had come so far.
But I think there's enough pieces of forgiveness.
Somewhere in broken heart.
I would not have chosen the road you have taken.
It has left us miles apart.
But I think I can still find the will to keep going.
Somewhere in my broken heart.
So fly, go ahead and fly until you find out to you are.
I will keep my love unspoken.
Somewhere in my broken heart.
I hope that in time you will find what you long for love that's
Written in the stars and when you finally do.
I think you'll see it's somewhere in my broken heart.
Girl, I will keep my love unspoken somewhere in my broken
Heart.
I hope that in time you will find what you long for.
Love that's written in the stars.
And when you finally do.
I think you will see it's somewhere in my broken heart.
Somewhere in my broken heart.
Somewhere in my broken heart.
Somewhere in my broken heart.That boy took the heart of me
Then he threw it back at me
Thought I had a grip on it
That boy got away with it
I don't mind the lack of sleep
I find that it helps me think
Every night I lie awake
And listen to my poor heart break
That boy took the breath right out of me
Eyes like the lights on a Christmas tree
Just one look
I was hooked
Love so innocent too bad we never finished it
That boy got the best of me
Better than I thought I'd be
Oh oh he drove me to tears
That boy stripped all my gears
Hard case thought I'd never sell
I gave and he took it well
Lovesick worked overtime
Heartaches beat double time
That boy took the breath right out of me
Eyes like the lights on a Christmas tree
Just one look
I was hooked
Love so innocent too bad we'll never finished itI can's stand to see a good man go to the waste
One who never combs his hair or shaves his face
A man who leans on wine over love that's told a lie
It tears me up to see a grown man cry
I never go around mirrors
I can't stand to see me without you by my side
I never go around mirrors
'Cause I've got a heartache to hide
I never go around mirrors
I can't stand to see me without you by my side
I never go around mirrors
'Cause I've got a heartache to hide
And it tears me up to see a grown man cryOh, listen to my story, I'll tell you no lies,
How John Lewis did murder poor little Omie Wise.
He told her to meet him at Adams's Springs.
He promised her money and other fine things.
So, fool-like she met him at Adams's Springs.
No money he brought her nor other fine things.
"Go with me, little Omie, and away we will go.
We'll go and get married and no one will know."
She climbed up behind him and away they did go,
But off to the river where deep waters flow.
"John Lewis, John Lewis, will you tell me your mind?
Do you intend to marry me or leave me behind?"
"Little Omie, little Omie, I'll tell you my mind.
My mind is to drown you and leave you behind."
"Have mercy on my baby and spare me my life,
I'll go home as a beggar and never be your wife."
He kissed her and hugged her and turned her around,
Then pushed her in deep waters where he knew that she would drown.
He got on his pony and away he did ride,
As the screams of little Omie went down by his side.
T'was on a Thursday morning, the rain was pouring down,
When the people searched for Omie but she could not be found.
Two boys went a-fishin' one fine summer day,
And saw little Omie's body go floating away.
They threw their net around her and drew her to the bank.
Her clothes all wet and muddy, they laid her on a plank.
Then sent for John Lewis to come to that place --
And brought her out before him so that he might see her face.
He made no confession but they carried him to jail,
No friends or relations would go on his bail.Harvey Bodine
Died at 11:09
And he left behind
A miserable wife.
And at 11:14
His heart came back on the screen.
Thanks to that defib machine,
He came back to life.
Oh but those five minutes were heaven.
A peace unlike he'd ever known.
And as he came back to the living
He thought "Please God, don't make me go
Back to life."
They told him what happened.
How that green line had flattened.
Oh, Harvey just started laughing.
He said, "You're telling me I died."
(You're telling me I died?)
Oh, and he thought about that woman.
How she treated him for years.
All a-yellin' and a-screamin'
And the nagging and the tears
And the way it wasn't really all that bad
When he lost his life.
Because those five minutes were heaven.
A peace unlike he'd ever known.
And now he was back with the living
And he found himself reaching for the phone.
He called his lawyer, he called his priest
Told 'em bout how they restarted his heart
How his wedding vows were technically
'Til death do us part.
You'll probably judge me
Then so be it.
But you know boys, here's how I see it
Harvey Bodine
Died at 11:09
And he left behind
A miserable wife.
Oh, but at 11:14
My heart came back on that screen.
Thanks to that defib machine,
I've come back to life.(Chip Davis, Bill Fries)
On a cold November mornin'
Back in nineteen-thirty-seven
With an early snow a-fallin'
On the three-foot tracks at Ames
Came a mighty strange contraption
Known to trainmen as a motor
But to folks in Colorado
She was known by another name
Up the canyons south of Sawpit
Past the red Cathedral spires
'Cross the yellow mountain switchbacks
And the rapids far below
On the high and lofty trestles
Near the fabled mines of Ophir
In the silver San Juan Mountains
Came a goose a-plowin' snow
[Chorus]
With a Pierce-Arrow engine,
Runnin' hot and on the loose
Came the Rio Grande Southern
The Gallopin' Goose
With a Pierce-Arrow engine
Runnin' hot and on the loose
Came Number Five, The Gallopin' Goose
'Twas a four-door auto-mobile
On a dozen wheels of iron
Sixteen feet of rockin' boxcar
Spot-welded to her tail
Loaded down with mercantile
Ten bags a' high-grade ore
Two mothers nursin' babies
Seven miners an' the mail
Up the side a' Sunshine Mountain
By internal gas combustion
Eight Pierce-Arrow pistons pullin'
Fifteen thousand pounds a' lead
At the snowshed on the summit
The conductor said his prayers
He declared a busted driveshaft
On the pass at Lizard Head
[Chorus]
With a Pierce-Arrow engine
Runnin' hot and on the loose
Came the Rio Grande Southern
The Gallopin' Goose
With a Pierce-Arrow engine
Runnin' hot and on the loose
Came Number Five, The Gallopin' Goose
[Musical interlude here.]
Down the three-percent to Rico
In the valley of Dolores
They still talk about the Southern
An' her flock of flyin' geese
From the roundhouse at Ridgway
To the depot at Durango
All the tracks are gone for scrap iron
And the ganders rest in peace
Up the canyons south of Sawpit
Past the red Cathedral spires
'Cross the yellow mountain switchbacks
And the rapids far below
On the high and lofty trestles
Near the fabled mines of Ophir
In the silver San Juan Mountains
There's a legend in the snow
[Chorus]
With a Pierce-Arrow engine
Runnin' hot and on the loose
Came the Rio Grande Southern
The Gallopin' Goose
With a Pierce-Arrow engine
Runnin' hot and on the loose
Came Number Five, The Gallopin' GooseI been knowin' you for a little while
You never fail to make me smile
We've never been together is just something we talk about
When you gonna come around?
When you gonna come around?
I'm the kind that likes to take it slow.
Well that's just the kind I'd like to get to know.
I just wanna get started, I need you to show me how.
When you gonna come around?
I've been waitin' with a heart full of love
Just for you to say it feels right enough.
I've been a-waiting and a-wondering,
When you're gonna give in and just give it up.
Your love is the sweetest thing I have ever found.
When you gonna come around?
When you gonna come around?
When you gonna come around?
Sittin' alone tonight, and just watchin' the clock
My mind is set on you, and it never stops
We've never been together is just something we talk about
Ooh, when you gonna come around?
When you gonna come around?
When you gonna come around?I took a vacation down by the ocean
But it's no fun with a heart that's broken
Ooh, baby, I wish you were here
I see lovers walking on the beach at sunset
I turned to you, I guess I'm just in the habit
Ooh, baby, I wish you were here
I wish you were here, I gotta be honest
It's no fun alone drinking PiÃÂ±a Coladas
I wish you were here but you're with another
It's gonna be a long, lonely summer
If I knew where you were
I'd send you a postcard
Having a blue time, I'm so lonely so far
Ooh, baby, I wish you were here
If I knew where you were
I'd send you a postcard
Having a blue time, I'm so lonely so far
Ooh, baby, I wish you were here
I put on my gown, I turn all the lights out
Pull back the covers, I'm going to bed now
Ooh, baby, I wish you were here
Ooh, baby, I wish you were here
Ooh, baby, I sure wish you were here(hank williams)

It was three o'clock, you came crawling in

Trying not to get caught
Coming home late again
While you thought I was sleeping
I was layin there a-thinking
About the way you been doing me wrong
So goodbye, farewell, so long
I'm gone
I'm gone like a southbound freight train
Semi on a four lane
Rolling down a one way track
I'm gone, see you later alligator
Baby, I ain't ever coming back
I'll be a long way from here
And you'll be crying in your beer
Like an old Hank Williams song
So goodbye, farewell, so long, I'm gone
I'm tired of your white lies, stupid little alibis
Shoulda known all along
Well, all my friends warned me
Told me what you used to be
Baby, now I'm catching on
Well, I wrote this little ditty
Just for you an' it ain't pretty
And you can't sing along
So goodbye, farewell, so long
I'm gone
I'm gone like a southbound freight train
Semi on a four lane, rolling down a one way track
I'm gone, see you later alligator
Baby, I ain't ever coming back
I'll be a long way from here
And you'll be crying in your beer
Like an old Hank Williams song
So goodbye, farewell, so long, I'm goneBig wind's a coming listen to the humming hurry kids be quick don't stall
Big wind's a coming listen to the humming if we don't hurry it'll get us all
From daylight to dusk we've been a working in the dust
Picking cotton working side by side
Now I can't forget yes I remember yet the way dad looked at me and he cried
Big wind's a coming
So scared my lips were scaled I ran across the field
To warn my mom to storm was on its way
I knew I'd won my race when I saw my mommy's face
She turned away and I could hear her say
Big wind's a coming
My dad was in the cellar and by now the sky was yellow
The wind's so strong the trees were falling
Outside I heard him crying as he lay there dying I can still hear my daddy calling
Big wind's a coming
Big wind big wind big wind[ with Diane McCall ]
If I were a carpenter and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway would you have my baby
If you worked your hands in wood and if you'd ask me
I'd answer you baby yes I would I'd place you above me
Save my love through loneliness save my love through sorrow
I've given you my ownliness so give me your tomorrow
[ ac.guitar - steel ]
If I were a miller at a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your pretty clothes and your soft shoes shining
And if a thinker were your trade you'd still find me
I'd be carrying the pots you've made and following behind you
Save my love through loneliness...
If I were a carpenter and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway would you have my babyWhen God made woman I wonder sometimes
If it was a flower he had in mind when he made her
A touch as gentle as a butterfly
A kiss so sweet it could stop time forever
God gave man a chance to be
The kind of strength a woman needs
He was supposed to be the one to carry that load
But there she goes, baby in her arms
World on her shoulders when her day starts
Working a job that don't pay much
But she thanks God it's enough
And there she is on her own two feet
He walked out but she's still got dreams
Tries to laugh when she feels like crying
Nobody'd blame her if she stopped trying
But she's got a heart that gives and gives
So you tell me who the strong one is
Tonight's the first night in a while
She put on her makeup wearing a smile, she's going out
And everything was all planned out
But the fever that the baby's got now, it's all shot down
She gives up what she wants to do
For what she has to, that's what a momma does
She'll be there like she always is
When the sun comes up
And there she goes, baby in her arms
World on her shoulders when her day starts
Working a job that don't pay much
But she thanks God it's enough
There she is on her own two feet
He walked out but she's still got dreams
Tries to laugh when she feels like crying
Nobody'd blame her if she stopped trying
But she's got a heart that gives and gives
So you tell me who the strong one is
And there she is on her own two feet
He walked out but she's still got dreams
Tries to laugh when she feels like crying
Nobody'd blame her if she stopped trying
But she got a heart that gives and gives
So you tell me who the strong one is
Yeah, you tell me who the strong one isShe was young and she was pretty a victim of a rich man's whim
When she met a wealthy gentleman Big Ben Colson and she had a child by him
Well he promised her a wedding that would give their child a name
But she waited at the altar till the sunset but her Big Ben never came
But she's not a bad girl didn't mean no wrong
She just loved the wrong man much too strong
Now he sits with the dignitaries and the wealthy ladies all love his charms
While she sits in a lonely shack in Alabama with his baby in her arms
But she's not a bad girl...Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, You know I need someone
Help
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never thought I needed any help in any way
Now that these days are gone, I'm not so self-assured
And now I find I changed my mind, opened up the door, so
Help me if You can, I'm feelin' down
And I do appreciate You bein' 'round, You know I do
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't You please, please help me, help me, help me?Dear one the world is waiting for the sunrise every road is heavy heavy with you
The crush on high his sleepy mate is calling and my heart is calling you
The crush on highONE SMALL MIRACLE
Writers Bill Anderson, Steve Wariner
RECORDED BY BRYAN WHITE
She's standing at the front door With her suitcase in her hand I'm starin' down the hallway Frozen where I stand She says she doesn't love me anymore Oh, Lord, what can I do It's gonna take a miracle to make her stay That's why I'm askin' You. CHORUS Please, don't you have a miracle Just lyin' around One small miracle, nobody needs Send it on down I'll never make it thru this night Thinkin' she's with someone else Please, don't You have Just one small miracle left? I know I haven't been a Saint And asking You for anything, takes nerve 'Cause You've already been blessed me With so much more in life, than I deserve But if You can make a blind man see And change the water into wine Surely You can keep her from Tearin' out this old heart of mine. CHORUS TAG: Please, don't You have just one small miracle left?Of all the hearts
In this big ol' world
Please tell me
Why did you have to break mine
For every tear I've cried
There must be a million fools
That could have caught your eye
What were the odds
That you and I would meet
We were just strangers
On a crowded street
Of all the hearts
That you could have loved
And left oh
Why did you have to be mine
Whatever made you
Choose me above the rest
Is there some unlucky
Charm that I possessI was dancin' with my darlin'
To the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced her to my loved one
And while they were dancin'
My friend stole my sweetheart from me
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darlin'
The night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee WaltzI thought I had seen pretty girls in my time but that was before I met you
I never saw one that I wanted for mine but that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved but that was before I met you
[Musical Interlude]
I wanted to ramble and always be free but that was before I met you
I said that no woman could ever hold me but that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging...
[Musical Interlude]If she was a drink
She'd be a single-barrelled
Bourbon on ice
Smooth with a kick
A chill and a burn all
At the same time
She's Sunday drive meets
High speed chase
She ain't just a song
She's the whole mix tape
She's so complicated
That's the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with
A little hurricane
And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
She don't just rain she pours
That girl right there's
The perfect storm
I know how to make her laugh
Or blush, or mad at me
But that's OK there ain't no one
More beautiful angry
And she loves just as deep
As she goes when she's down
The highs match the lows
Can't have one without the other
And I love her just the way
God made her
Sunshine mixed with
A little hurricane
And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
But she don't just rain she pours
That girl right there's
The perfect storm
She's the girl of a lifetime
A guy like me spends his whole life
Looking for, that girl right there's
The perfect storm
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
(She destroys me in that t-shirt)When I left, I left walkin' wounded
I made my escape from the rain
Still a prisoner of hurt
I had months worth of work
Just freein' my mind of the pain
I had hours of sittin' alone in the dark
Listenin' to sad songs and comin' apart
Lord knows I made crying an art
Woe is a slow healing heart
A slow healing heart dyin' to mend
Longin' for love, lonely again
When the spirit is broken
And the memories start
Nothin' moves slower
Than a slow healing heart
How I prayed for blind faith to lead me
To places where I'm not afraid
Now I'm doin' fine both in body and mind
Some hurts take longer to fade
But there's a part of my feelings ever on guard
Against looks that are tender and words that are hard
'Cause I still remember those cutting remarks
Oh, it's painful a slow healing heart
A slow healing heart dyin' to mend
Longin' for love, lonely again
When the spirit is broken
And the memories start
You know nothin' moves slower
Than a slow healing heart
Oh, nothin' moves slower
Than a slow healing heartÃa m'amuse que tu sois ma muse
Dis moi si Ã§a t'amuse aussi
Ou bien si tu refuses
Le fluide ne s'use que si l'on en abuse
Et si Ã§a m'use parfois ma muse
Tellement Ã§a fuse de toute parts
D'antennes en satellites
Ou pylÃ´nes au hasard
Je ne regrette pas
Mais
Ne le rÃ©pÃ¨te jamais Ã  personne
Et surtout garde Ã§a pour nous, alone

Sous la cendre froide
Autrement dit, "Sois toujours

Ãa m'inspire chaque fois que je respire
Ton essence complice, qui goutte Ã  goutte
S'immisce en moi
Que s'Ã©loigne le pire, que s'effacent les frontiÃ¨res
Que s'affinent les contrastes et s'encrent nos mystÃ¨res
Les nerfs se changent en air
Flottant autour des mÃ©tÃ©ores
Et la petite musique se glisse
Entre les interstices

Et sois au rendez-vous
Au rendez-vousYou finally said something good when you said goodbye
So don't wait around to see if I'm a gonna cry
Instead of tears streaming down my face you'll find a great big smile in their place
You finally said something good when you said goodbye
I don't wanna rush things honey but I'll help you pack
I've been waitin' on you to make a move like that
Don't waste anytime on words my dear you already said what I wanna hear
Yeah you finally said something good when you said goodbye
[ guitar ]
Better make your move faster honey I'll call a cab
Now don't worry about the money I'll pay the tab
Now you've been talking for nearly a year and at last you said what I wanted to hear
Yeah you finally said something good when you said goodbye
Oh you finally said something good...
Oh you finally said something good when you said goodbye(Na na na na na na na)
(Na na na na na na na)
You ever wondered why country songs say the same old thing,
Like a broken record skipping down on Main,
Pretty girls, pickups and cut-off jeans?
You know what I mean
Dirt roads, corn rows and homemade wine
Juke joints, jumping on the county line
Heard 'em singing 'bout it a million times
But I don't mind
As long as there's a small town and a Saturday night
Blue jean babies in the full moonlight
Tip back your Dixie, howl at the stars
Every time you hear that sly guitar
And your baby's on the tailgate
And you're stealing those kisses to a little George Strait
That's how we're rocking, that's how we roll
As long as there's country on the radio
(Na na na na na na na)
(Na na na na na na na)
There's always gonna be a party out in the pines
Always gonna be a shot up highway sign
Paper sack full of beer and a jar of shine
From time to time
There's always gonna be people trying to run us down
Saying we ain't got nothing on a big town
I bet they'd come around
If they came on down
As long as there's a small town and a Saturday night
Blue jean babies in the full moonlight
Tip back your Dixie, howl at the stars
Every time you hear that sly guitar
And your baby's on the tailgate
And you're stealing those kisses to a little George Strait
That's how we're rocking, that's how we roll
As long as there's country on the radio
There's always gonna be a part of me
Kicking back in B-F-E
Yea, that's how it's always gonna be
As long as there's a small town and a Saturday night
Blue jean babies in the full moonlight
Tip back your Dixie, howl at the stars
Every time you hear that sly guitar
And your baby's on the tailgate
And you're stealing those kisses to a little George Strait
That's how we're rocking, that's how we roll
As long as there's country on the radio
(Na na na na na na na)
Some country on the radio
(Na na na na na na na)
As long as there's a small town
(Na na na na na na na)
Hmm Saturday nights
(Na na na na na na na)
Blue jean babies
(Na na na na na na na)
Yeah, tip back your Dixie
(Na na na na na na na) Stealing those kissesShe's a devil in disguise, you can see it in her eyes
She's tellin' dirty lies, she's a devil in disguise, in disguise
Now a woman like that, all she does is hate you
She doesn't know what makes a man a man
She'll talk about the time that she's been with you
She'll speak your name to everyone she can
She's a devil in disguise, you can see it in her eyes
She's tellin' dirty lies, she's a devil in disguise, in disguise
Unhappiness has been her close companion
Her world is full of jealousy and doubt
It gets her off to see a person crying
She's just the kind that you can do without
She's a devil in disguise, you can see it in her eyes
She's tellin' dirty lies, she's a devil in disguise, in disguise
Her number always turns up in your pocket
Whenever you are looking for a dime
It's alright to call her but I'll bet you
The moon is full and you're just wasting time
She's a devil in disguise, you can see it in her eyes
She's tellin' dirty lies, she's a devil in disguise, in disguise
In disguise, in disguise
(In disguise, in disguise)You're layin' here with me we're holding each other it feels good so it must be right
You've touched me into thinking this could go on forever
I don't care if forever is just for tonight
Let's go as far as this feeling will take us we've never been there together before
Let's go as far as this feeling will take us
And I've got a feeling we'll come back for more
I'm like a forest and you're like a wildfire that's spreading all over me
Baby come with me let's go to heaven
At moments like this girl that's where we should be
Let's go as far as this feeling
For that kind of feeling we'll come back for meMy love is warmer than the warmest sunshine softer than a sigh
My love is deeper than the deepest ocean wider than the sky
My love is brighter than the brightest star that shines every night above
And there is nothing in this world that could ever change my love
Something happened to my heart the day that I met you
Something that I never felt before
You are always on my mind no matter what I do
And every day it seems I want you more
My love is warmer
Once I thought that love was meant for anyone else but me
Once I thought you'd never come my way
Now it only goes to show how wrong we all can be
For now I have to tell you every day
My love is warmerJust outside of delta country
Where the bitter weeds growin' wild
Born seven miles outside of Woodland
Was a Chicasaw County child
An Poppa done brung us some peppermint candy
Momma fixed a custard pie
Bought her a store-bought doll from Jackson
She's a apple of everyone's eye
Chickasaw County child
Is gonna be ok
Chickasaw County child
You gonna be somebody someday
Sporting her checkered feed sack dress
A ruby ring from a Cracker Jack box
Shufflin' on down that gravel road
Barefooted and chunking rocks
Momma said looky here dumplin'
You'll go far, cause you got style
Ain't nothing in this world gonna hold her back
Her pretty Chickasaw County child
Chickasaw County child
Is gonna be ok
Chickasaw County child
You gonna be somebody someday
Leavin' the county a week from Monday
Ain't got much to pack
A tin can of black strap sogga molasses
And her momma's almanac
Momma done made her a brand new dress
Made of blue polka dotted silk
Two postcards from California
And a gallon of buttermilk
Chickasaw County child
Is gonna be ok
Chickasaw County child
You gonna be somebody someday
You gonna be somebody someday
You gonna be somebody somedayLeaves are falling, the wolves are calling
And death goes with them.
The light is waning the night will reign o'er me
But in the heart of the deepest dark, the light is shining
I lift my head from my dying bed and sing
Oh what beautiful things I see
The lunatics with the fire-sticks and the deadly rhythm,
They reprimand us with reckless savagery.
But in the midst of apocalypse, the dove brings tidings
I lift my eyes to the the azure skies and sing.
Oh what beautiful things I see
We're so surprised when we realize that we're deftly skilled in
The very vices we swear off violently
Still at the crux of the worst in us, the hope is hiding.
I lift my gaze from my wicked ways and sing
Oh what beautiful things I see(Dolly Parton)
We once were so close now the love light
That glowed has now gone out of our eyes
And the good life we had for some reason went bad
And the love that once lived here has died
How did we get here, where did it start
When did we walk out of each other's hearts
Where did we lose it, how did love die
When, where, and how, but most of all why
Most of all, why did we let love die
Like the withering leaves in the fall
And why did we wait 'til it was to late
To realize how much we lost
How did we get here, where did it start
When did we walk out of each other's hearts
Where did we lose it, how did love die
When, where, and how, but most of all whyWhat am I supposed to do now that we are through
I suppose to look around and find somebody new
Change my life go away pretend you never meant a thing to me
I suppose to be happy say that you play fair
I suppose to say that's life and say I didn't care
Change my mind walked away pretend you never meant a thing to me
Well how can you just sit there and say it was a fling
That all the happy times we had just didn't mean a thing
How can you start over and forget everything pretend you never meant a thing to me
[ guitar ]
I suppose to me cheerful greed my friends and smile
Tell them lies and deep inside I'm crying all the while
Change my mind go away pretend you never meant a thing to me
Well how can you just sit there...
Pretend you never meant a thing to me pretend you never meant a thing to mePlease release me, let me go
'Cause I don't love you anymore
And to live without love is a sin
So release me and let me love again
I have found a new love, dear
And I'll always want him near
His lips are warm while yours are cold
So release me, my darlin' let me go
Oh please release me, let me go
'Cause I just won't love you anymore
And to live together we both know is a sin
So release me, release me and let me love again
Oh, please, please, please, please
Release me, let me go
'Cause I, I don't love you anymore
And to live together is a sin
So release me and let me love againThe moon is shinnin' down through the pines
And it spreads its light across the mountain side
And I wonder what you're doin' tonight
Yes I wonder what you're doin' and I wonder if everythings alright
Well I'm up on this mountain and you're there in town
Sleepin' in your feather bed and I'm layin' on the ground
I never knew that I could feel so lost and all alone
And singin' such a lonesome cowboy song
Well I'm just a cowboy I'm workin' all day long
At night I eat my beef and beans and then I sing this song
Yes I wonder what you're doin' tonight
Yes I wonder what you're doin' and I wonder if everthing's all right
Well I'm up on this mountain...
Now them calves are bawlin' and I can't get no rest
That cold wind's a blowin' and I'm freezin' half to death
Yes I wonder what you're doin' tonight
Yes I wonder what you're doin' and I wonder if everthing's all right
Well I'm up on this mountain...
It won't be long now and I'll be comin' down
And I better not find any rednecks hangin' round
Yes I wonder what you're doin' tonight
Yes I wonder what you're doin' and I wonder if everthing's all right
Well I'm up on this mountain...The birthday party was over toys were scattered here and there
Seven candles laid by the last piece of cake in front of an empty chair
A mother said son I know you're disappointed but please try to understand
Your daddy's been awfuly busy cause he's a big railroad man
So you go on to sleep now she kissed him and turned out the light
Moments later a window opened and the young boy slipped out into the night
He was on his way to the depot the express wasn't due till ten
But they they just might run a special if they knew that dad was comin' in
The mighty scream of the 9:15 tore through the winter night
The whirl of the wheels and the clang of the steel jarred the country side
The southbound freight was running late desperate to make up time
When a giant of a man with a sack in his hand leaped off like a mountain lion
He hit and rolled like an old pro and he got up off the ground
He brushed the snow from off his grimy clothes and said
Hey kid what's the name of this town
The frightened boy said Grandville sir the man said well what do ya know
Ha I used to live in this little one horse town
I guess about six or maybe it was seven years ago
I told my wife when I left here that I'd be coming back in style
Ha oh well anyway it looks like I'm back I guess I just might as well visit awhile
So if you'll be so kind as to point the way to the Joneses
Why I'll go now and leave you be
The young boy said sir the only Joneses that live around here
Is my mama and my daddy and me
Course dad he's been gone a long time now
Course now he don't want to be ye understand
It's just that daddy's got lots of important things to do
You see he's a big railroad man
He sends me birthday presents and mama reads me what he writes
In his last letter daddy promised that he was gonna try and make it home tonight
The old man scratched the side of his head and he said
Grandville Grandville I thought you said Denville oh well I guess that's natural mistake
Now if you'll just point the way to the depot
Why I'll be checking on the next fast freight
Tell you what you run on home now and you tell your mom
To go ahead and fix up your daddy's room
Cause I've got the strangest feeling
That your daddy just might be coming home pretty soonLonely Christmas I'll have this year lots of teardrops cause you're not here
Lonely Christmas since you went away lonely Christmas on this Christmas Day
When I'll wake up on Christmas morning I'll be alone
It will take a while to realize that you are really gone
Missing someone yes I do lonely Christmas my dear without you
[ guitar - steel ]
Lonely Christmas I'll have this year...
Lonely Christmas on this Christmas Day(Johnny Cash)
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the ties that bind
Because you're mine I walk the line
I find it very very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes I admit it, I am a fool for you
Because you're mine I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day's light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk that line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I'm gonna walk it
I'm gonna walk the line
I'm gonna walk it, walk it, walk it
I'm gonna walk that line
I'm gonna walk it because you're mine
I'm gonna walk it, walk it
I'm gonna walk the line
I'm gonna walk it, walk it
I'm gonna walk the line
I'm gonna walk it
I'm gonna walk the lineLooking back on the memory of
The dance we shared beneath the stars above
For a moment all the world was right
How could I have known you'd ever say goodbye
And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain
But I'd of had to miss the dance
Holding you I held everything
For a moment wasn't I the king
But if I'd only known how the king would fall
Hey who's to say you know I might have changed it all
And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain
But I'd of had to miss the dance
Yes my life is better left to chance
I could have missed the pain but I'd of had to miss the danceA bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely girls like me
The cabarets and honky tonks their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights
Lights that say forget his name in a glass of cherry wine
Lights that offer other guys with empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world so gay and bright
But I can't say I love you dear to a street of city lights
Lights that say forget his love in a different atmosphere
Lights that lure are nothing but a masquerade for tears
Yes they paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
And I just can't say I love you to a street of city lightsI'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All the sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain
If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you
So though the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain
Raindrops falling from heaven
Will never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
Someday when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll never see me complain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rainOh it's been such a long long time looks like I could get you off my mind
But I can't for just the thought of you turns my world a misty blue
Just the mention of your name turns the flicker to a flame
I think of things that we used to do then my whole world turns misty blue
I should forget you heaven knows I've tried
But when I said I'm glad we're through my heart knows that I've lied
Oh it's been such a long long time looks like I could get you off my mind
But I can't for just the thought of you turns my world a misty blue
Yes just the thought of you turns my world a misty blueI got a lust for life
And a dangerous mind
In my trail of dust
Who knows what you'll find
I can take a tree
And tear it from its roots
And if you see me
I suggest you move
We're full grown men
But we act like kids
We'll face the music
Next time we roll in
Give me a spark (give him a spark)
You'll get an atom bomb (you'll get an atom bomb)

Next time we roll inI've died a thousand times since you went away
Life is just a heartache I'm lonely night and day
I pray that you'll come back and love me ever more
And make me live again like you made me live before
Make me live again life has vanished since you've gone
This world I'm living in is so empty and alone
I pray that you'll come back and love me ever more
And make me live again like you made me live before
[ piano ]
Make me live again...Some are green
We all know the cost
Comes from wanting things
That cant be yours
Envy is a killer
Ya'll have to fight
When ever he's present
He shows in the light of your eyes
Some are clear
Like a mountain stream
They don't harbor hate
If you know what I mean
Their mind is untroubled
Gilt has no hold
No one can hide
From the story that's told in your eyes
Your eyes are the mirror of your soul
Your eyes give you away
Whatever things are written in your heart
Your eyes can't help but say
Some are hard
All compassion gone
They don't care
Who they walk upon
Afraid to be gentle
Afraid to be kind
They think that loves a weakness
They don't want to find in your eyes
Your eyes are the mirror of your soul
Your eyes give you away
Whatever things are written in your heart
Your eyes can't help but say
Some are blue blue blue
Some are warm
Like a summers day
Full of love
That they give away
Good done in secrets
God will reward
His mighty blessing
He will record in your eyes
Your eyes are the mirror of your soul
Your eyes give you away
Whatever things are written in your heart
Your eyes can't help but say
Your eyes are the mirror of your soul
Your eyes give you away
Whatever things are written in your heart
Your eyes can't help but say
Your eyes are the mirror of your soul
Your eyes give you away
Whatever things are written in your heartThere's more pretty girls than one
More pretty girls then one
Every old town that I rambled around
And there's more pretty girls than one
Mama talked to me last night
She gave me some good advise
She said "Son, you'd better quit this old ramblin' all around
And mary you a sweet little wife"
(break)
Honey, look down that old lonesome road
Hang down your pretty head and cry
'cause I'm thinking all about them pretty little gals
And a-hopin' that I never die
There's more pretty girls than one
There's more pretty girls then one
Every old town that I rambled around
And there's more pretty girls than one
(break)Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Don't let the moon break your heart
Love blooms at night in daylight it dies
Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Oh, keep your heart for me for someday
I'll return and you know you're
The only one I'll ever love.
Too many nights
Too many stars
Too many moons to change your mind
If I'm gone too long don't forget where you belong
When the stars come out remember you are mine.
Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Don't let the moon break your heart
Love blooms at night in daylight it dies
Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Oh, keep your heart for me for someday
I'll return and you know you're
The only one I'll ever love.
Too many miles
Too many days
Too many nights to be alone
So please keep your heart while we're apart
Don't you linger in the moonlight while I'm gone.
Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Don't let the moon break your heart
The love blooms at night in daylight it dies
Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Oh, keep your heart for me for someday
I'll return and you know you're
The only one I'll ever love.
You're the only one I'll ever love(Dolly Parton)
When you need to be love, let me love you
When you need a friend, reach out to me
When you need reassuring that it's alright
Anything you need, that what I'll be
For I want to be the one you always come to
When you find you need a place to go
Let mine be the hand you always cling to
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold
I can be the one that makes you happy
I'll be your umbrella when it rains
I will be someone that you can count on
In other words, I'll be your everything
For I want to be the one you always come to
When you find you need a place to go
Let mine be the hand you always cling to
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to holdThe man who preached the funeral said it really was a simple way to die
He lated down to rest one afternoon and never opened up his eyes
They hired me and Fred and Joe to dig the grave and carry up some chairs
It took us seven hours and I guess we must have drunk a case of beer
I guess I oughta go and watch them put him down but I don't own the suit
And anyway when they start talkin' bout the fire and hell well I get spooked
So I'll just sit here in my truck and act like I don't know him when they pass
And anyway when they're all through I've got to go to work and mow the grass
Well here they come and who's that riding in that big ol' shiny limousine
Look at all that chrome I do believe that that's the sharpest thing I've seen
That must belong to his great Uncle someone said he owned a big ol' farm
When they get parked I'll mosey down and look it over that won't do no harm
Well that must be the widow in the car and would you take a look at that
That sure is a pretty dress you know some women do look good in black
But he's not even in the ground and they say his track is up for sale
They say she took it pretty hard but you can't tell too much behind a veilNow old Jake was a cowboy he'd worked his whole life on the range
And he could rope, and he could ride with any man just half his age
Old Jake was my hero and me I was just a green kid
And I prayed that someday I could do all the things old Jake did
Well we sat around the bunk house one cold and lonely winter's night
Just chewin' and talkin' and smokin' by the coal oil light
Well old Jake had been aweful quiet that evenin' and he stared hard and long
He said young puncher you goin' to remember me after I'm gone
Whatever happens to old cowboy heros like me
A broken down part of a man I used to be
Will I be forgotten or live on in your memory
Whatever happens to old cowboy heros like me
It's been a long time and oh how the years fade away
Well I stopped by the bunk house were me and old Jake used to stay
They say Jake died about ten years ago and they buried him out there on the plains
Old friend you might be gone but your memory always stays the same
Whatever happens...Five months, three weeks, and two days ago
He walked out of my life
Took every ounce of strength I had
Not to break right down and cry
Any other time I probably would
Oh, but there's no need for that
'Cause I'm sure he's not gone for good
Yeah, he's still comin' back
At least that's what I tell myself
To keep my heart from breakin'(well)
What else am I supposed to do
I can't bear to face the truth
I don't know where he is tonight
But I know when he turns out the lights
He won't be holdin' someone else
At least that's what I tell myself
I still remember our last kiss
And just how sweet it was
How he acted like he didn't care
Oh, but I know he still does
And right before he said goodbye
He took off his ring
Said, "I don't need this anymore"
Oh, but that don't mean a thing
At least that's what I tell myself
To keep my heart from breakin'(well)
What else am I supposed to do
I can't bear to face the truth
I don't know where he is tonight
But I know when he turns out the lights
He won't be holdin' someone else
At least that's what I tell myself
It's another sleepless night
Here in this lonely bed
I might not hold him anymore
But he don't love me any less
At least that's what I tell myself
To keep my heart from breakin'(well)
What else am I supposed to do
I can't bear to face the truth
I don't know where he is tonight
But I know when he turns out the lights
He won't be holdin' someone else
At least that's what I tell myselfHappiness happiness the greatest gift that I posses
I thank the Lord I've been blessed with more than my share of happiness
To me this old world is a wonderful place
And I'm just about the luckiest human in the whole human race
I've got no silver and I've got no gold just a whole lot of happiness in my soul
Happiness happiness...
Happiness to me is an ocean tide or a sunset fading on a mountain side
Or maybe a big old heaven full of stars up above
When I'm in the arms of the one I love
Happiness is a field of grain lifting its face to the falling rain
I can see it in the sunshine I breathe it in the rain happiness everywhere
Happiness happiness...
A wise old man told me one time that happiness is nothing but a frame of mind
I hope when you go to measuring my success
That you don't count my money count my happiness
Happiness happiness...
Happiness happiness...Dolores was her middle name
She read the book and everything
Now I know how old I am
Have you ever seen that film?
Talking to a hotel mirror with my glasses off
Now you know just what he's crying about
Dolores was her middle name
Dangling from a silver chain
Where'd you learn to talk that way?
I look like James Mason's ghost
Talking to a friend after school but you don't see
That she's really looking right at me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dolores was her middle name
And now her mother's wondering
If I could see my wrinkled face
Paint her lovely toenails red
Writing all my problems in a secret little book
Now I know just what he should've done
Talking to me like I'm just a little late
Now you know just what he's talking about
Dolores was her middle name
Dolores was her middle nameI drive an 85 Chevrolet pick up truck,
Got dust on the dash to bring her good luck.
She never breaks down, she never gives up,
Still goin' strong.
Got a job in the city, get up before dawn,
Drive 60 miles an hour to get back home.
The girl I love and a five year old,
I got no regrets, this is as good as it gets.
[Chorus]
I'm a happy man
I've got everything I need,
Standing right in front of me.
It's a simple plan,
But it seems to work just fine.
I count my blessings all the time
For who I am,
I'm a happy man.
There's a river that runs through my back yard.
Don't know where it ends,
Don't know where it starts.
It whispers my name, and it speaks to my heart,
Like an old friend.
there's a place down by the property line,
Two young lovers made a promise one time.
They carved their initials in the side of a tree for eternity
Well baby that's you and me.
[Chorus]
Give me faith, give me freedom,
Friends and family
Like the little gifts from heaven
Right down here with me.
[Chorus]
Hey I'm a Happy Man.I love you so much I can't let you go
And sometimes I believe you love me
But somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a door without any key
Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a window that I can't see through
There's a wall so high it reaches the sky
Somewhere between me and you
[ steel ]
Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a love I can't understand
It's there for a while then it fades like a smile
And I'm left in the middle again
Somewhere between your heart and mine...Welcome to my world
Won't you come on in
Miracles I guess
Still happen now and then
Step into my heart
Leave your cares behind
Welcome to my world
Built with you in mind
Knock and then door shall be opened
Seek and you will find
Ask and you'll be given
The key to this heart of mine
I'll be waiting there
With my arms unfurled
Waiting just for you
Welcome to my world
Knock and then door shall be opened
Seek and you will find
Ask and you'll be given
The key to this heart of mine
I'll be waiting there
With my arms unfurled
Waiting just for you
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my worldEveryone I ever owned, excpet the one I'm driving now
Been stripped down to the bare bone at Sam's Salvage Yard
There's a Mustang and a GTO, bloody seats, and caved in grilld sent outta town
There's a scar on my forehead, for every busted windshield
My old cars, they haunt me still
Cuase I droven every one of 'em over the edge
It's a wonder I wasn't killed
My old cars, rise up from the wheel
I wish to hell and back was far enough
to outrun, your memory
I drive by that junkyard, count the times you broke my heart
Watchin' a jackleg with a socket wrench
Drinkin' beer and yankin' parts
I can count these broken bones, cause broken bone will heal
But I can't stand to count the times you said I love you,
aint no big deal
My old cars, they haunt me still
Cuase I droven every one of 'em over the edge
It's a wonder I wasn't killed
My old cars, rise up from the wheel
I wish to hell and back was far enough
to outrun, your memory
Last week I bought a 442, black as ace of spades
I sold my half of grandpa's land, bes he's rollin' is his grave
My friends say I'll get over you,
but my friends they just dont know
Gonna take her out on a 41, see how fast she can go
My old cars, they haunt me still
Cuase I droven every one of 'em over the edge
It's a wonder I wasn't killed
My old cars, rise up from the wheel
I wish to hell and back was far enough
to outrun, your memory
I wish to hell and back was far enough
to outrun, your memoryIt all started in this little town
Way down in Texas
When I first heard old Johnny Cash
Singing prison blues
I picked my guitar like a fool
And read them country magazines
Keeping up to snuff on the Music City news
One Sunday morning found me there
On the streets of Nashville
Humming out the chorus to my latest melody
Well I whooped into old Tootsie's bar
And told them local pickers
I'd done come to capture Music City, U.S.A.
Can't you hear the music ringing
Can't you hear the singers singing
Can't you hear somebody humming on my homemade melody
The lost and found are searching here
And some new face from everywhere
Is come to capture Music City, U.S.A.
One Sunday evening found me Lord
In a corner booth at Limebaugh's
Drinking black coffee and eating chili
Like Marty Robbins and Earnest Tubb
Set there tuning up my guitar
Lord, I couldn't wait until Monday morning
Figured if I couldn't make it then nobody could
Well the years have come and gone
I'm still here in Nashville
Stumbling up and down 16th and 17th Avenue
Bugging everybody here
That I can get to stop and listen
Trying hard to do all the things
I told my mom and dad that I was going to do
Can't you hear the music ringing
Can't you hear the singers singing
Can't you hear somebody humming on my homemade melody
The lost and found are searching here
And some new face from everywhere
Is come to capture Music City, U.S.A.Welcome to my world
Won't you come on in
Miracles, I guess
Still happen now and then
Step into my heart
Leave your cares behind
Welcome to my world
Built with you in mind
Knock and the door will open
Seek and you will find
Ask and you'll be given
The key to this world of mine
I'll be waiting here
With my arms unfurled
Waiting just for you
Welcome to my worldJohnny Walker sat
At a table in a bar
Minding his own affairs
Drinking his namesake
Over the rocks
He was drunk
Too drunk to care
When a girl in the bar
Walked up beside him
And this is what she said
She said, a woman came by
With a letter for you
And this is what the letter said
[Chorus]
Dear, John, please, Johnny
Please come home
I need your love and
The kids, they gotta be fed
And John, if you don't
Hurry back, I'll be gone
Yes, that's what the letter said
The letter that Johnny Walker read
Then John
He got up from the table
Slowly, he walked outside
He was thinking of his wife
And little children at home
And how his drinking
Had ruined their lives
Then John, he stared off
Into that street light
And a vision filled his
Poor, poor heart with dread
For it was him lying drunk
There in that gutter
Clutching in his hand
The letter that Johnny Walker read
And this is what it said
[Chorus: x2]I went walking along a highway
Lost in a trance as I went on my way
I heard a bad beat
That weird, weird beat
Everywhere I put my feet
Well it all started about a week ago
When my lover told me
He said well baby you gotta go
I heard a bad beat
That weird, weird beat
Everywhere I put my feet
It was the beat of sorrow
It was the beat of the moon
I know Ill be here tomorrow
If I dont find another love soon
So Ill keep walk, walk, walking
Walk, walk, walk,
Walking down the highway
Lost in trance as I went on my way
I heard a bad beat
That weird, weird beat
Everywhere I put my feet
So I went walking along the highway
Lost in a trance as I went on my way
And I heard a bad beat
That weird, weird beat
Everywhere I put my feet
Ooh trouble
He gives me nothing but trouble
Trouble, trouble
He keeps disturbing my sleep
Ooh trouble, trouble
He gives me nothing but trouble
Trouble, trouble
He gives me nothing but
TroubleA rodeo's just a rodeo after riding several years
From ol' Cheyenne to Houston they never cause too much fear
But let me tell you about one that will chill your very soul
It happens in December when it's snowin' and it's cold
In Oklahoma City there's a building of concrete
It's where the toughest stock and men will gather and compete
The points have all been tallied and the stock has all been brought
We've got just two more hours cause it starts at eight o'clock
It's the Finals the NFR the Series of the sport
Hey rookie can you take ten head have you got the heart
You think you're a tough cowboy we'll find out in the end
When that final whistle blows and the stock's all in the pen
The coliseum's quiet except for the sounds
Of cowboys getting ready and the workmen of the grounds
The cowboys ask each other, what each other's got
"Did you draw ol' Necklace or pluck old Double-Ought
The tension now is mounting as the crowd starts pouring in
A shiver goes all through me like from a cold cold wind
I hear the horses comin' runnin' down the alleyway
They're snortin' and a blowin' as men shut the sliding gates
It's the Finals the NFR...
We had too much time a while ago but not enough time now
The Anthem is now over the grand entry's going out
I sit there on my bronc I'm ready and I wait
I hear a chute gate open so I look out through the gate
A horse comes boiling out and blows up at the roof
And then there comes another kicking like a curly wolf
I hear the chute boss holler through the yelling of the crowd
He says there's one ahead of you so you'd better get screwed down
It's the Finals the NFR...
I nod my head, I'm in a daze the horse goes boiling out
I run my spurrs into his neck and then I drag 'em out
My mind is in a blur my eyes are seeing red
The flank catch slams into my back, his rump bangs on my head
From somewhere in the background I can hear a buzzer sound
My hand's jerked from the riggin and I crash into the ground
I stumble to my feet as I stagger to the wall
I wonder to myself is it really worth it all
It's the Finals the NFR...Born to lose I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose it seems so hard to bear
How I long to always have you near
You've grown tired and now you say we're through
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose my every hope is gone
It's so hard to face an empty dawn
You were all the happiness I knew
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose and now I'm losing you(C.W. McCall, Bill Fries, Chip Davis)
One time when I's growin' up -- it was when I's a kid -- there was nothin' to do at home so I called up on a friend an' said "Let's pack us a box lunch an' go down to the Nishnabotna an' go swimmin'. An' maybe look for some toads."
My friend said he thought that's a good idea 'cause he didn't have nothin' to do either an' he was outta toads.
So we packed up our box lunches an' we started out a-walkin', an' we come to a big iron bridge which was five miles from town where we observed a big sign which says "West Nishnabotna". I says "This here's the place, an', an' now if we could just find some toads an' go for a good swim, we could have fun all day doin' nothin', just loafin' around in the creek."
We jumped into that dirty water an' I thought we might be able to swim in it, but we quickly discovered that we could not even begin to dog-paddle in it. Be, because right where we was, the Nishnabotna was only four-an'-a-half inches deep. So we wound up a-crawlin' along down on all fours in it, through the mud an' beer cans an' yucky things an' old pieces a' cars.
We went past a bunch a' fenders an' a couple a' Plymouth hubcaps, when we come to a place where we thought there might be some toads. When we was surprised by a farmer who told us to get on out of there an' to never come back or he'd call up the sheriff an' have us put into jail for the rest of our natural-born lives with nothin' to eat but bread an' water so we'd starve.
But time passes by real quickly when you're havin' fun, so we ran through the fenders and the mud to the bridge again. But when we got back there we sadly discovered that the sun had been out and our backs was all blistered so bad we had to lay flat on our bellies for two weeks in bed which made us sick to our stomachs an' we didn't care about nothin' anymore.
It just ain't too good for your livers to go swimmin' in that river. You can get cut up pretty bad in there an' there ain't too many toads.
There's nothin' but, There's nothin' but mud in there an' there's all kinds a' crud, an' it's layin' all over the place so you'd better watch out.
If you wanna get sick, just go crawlin' around in that creek. There's a whole lot a' bad things that can happen to you.
No, it ain't, No, it ain't good for your liver to hunt toads in that river. The West Nishnabotna is the creek of my childhood.All my ex's live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my ex's live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee
Rosanna's down in Texarkana
Wanted me to push her broom
Sweet Eileen's in Abilene
She forgot I hung the moon
And Allison's in Galveston
Somehow lost her sanity
And Dimple's who now lives in Temple's
Got the law looking for me
All my ex's live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my ex's live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee
I remember that old Frio River
Where I learned to swim
But it brings to mind another time
Where I wore my welcome thin
By transcendental meditation
I go there each night
But I always come back to myself
Long before daylight
All my ex's live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my ex's live in Texas
Therefore I reside in Tennessee
Some folks think I'm hidin'
It's been rumored that I died
But I'm alive and well in TennesseeHE WAS THERE ALL THE TIME

Sharing each new day with Him Is a cup of fresh wine. And oh what I missed, He's been waiting right there all the time. ChorusThere's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying the stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying the stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
Oh, it makes me wonder
Oh, it makes me wonder
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking
Oh, it makes me wonder
Oh, it makes me wonder
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And she's buying the stairway to heavenWhen Davey dropped dead the papers said he was a football hero
Kids all cried and the rumors died and before he was in the ground
Jimmy was up on the strip job, sucking another one down

Went across town to Dr. Brown beggin' for some pain pills
Chorus:
Pain pills, a little bit of hurt is surely gonna kill a lot of good people in these here hills
Lord, won't you save us from these old pain pills
When Hazel Jean died, her mother tried to say it was pneumonia
The minister's wife told a bold-faced lie to protect her daughter's name
When half of the congregation was hooked on the very same thing
When Tommy caught wind that his Uncle Tim was about to die from cancer
When to his house and broke the door down tryin' to steal some pain pills
Chorus
The girl next door's on the bathroom floor
Thinkin' 'bout taking her a little bit more
Ain't never been this bad before
Enough of these pain pills, pain pills
A little bit of hurt is surely gonna kill a lot of good people
In these here hills
Oh Lord, won't you save us from these old pain pillsI'M NOT THAT GOOD AT GOODBYE

I don't want to talk it over one more time
No there's not much use in talkin'. If you've made up your mind
And darlin' I don't need to tell you why
You know that I'm not that good at goodbye
Please don't tell me you're leavin' if you go
Just let me turn my head while you walk out the door
'Cause if I see you leavin' I will die
You know that I'm not that good at goodbye
Lord goodbyes just make it harder anyhow
So if you really feel like leavin' do it now
And let me keep a little of my pride
You know that I'm not that good at goodbye
I don't want to know you're leavin' when you go
'Cause if we reach the part where you're standin' at the door
Well I know I'd just break down again and cry
You know that I'm not that good at goodbyeI ain't gonna work on the railroad
I ain't gonna work on the farm
Lay down the shack 'til the mail train comes back
And I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Lay around the shack 'til the mail train comes back
And I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms
Now where were was you last Friday night?
While I was lying in jail
Walking the streets with another man
Wouldn't even go for my bail
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Lay around the shack 'til the mail train comes back
And I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms
I know your parents don't like me
They drove me away from your door
Had my life to live over
I'd never go there any more
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Lay around the shack 'til the mail train comes back
And I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Lay around the shack 'til the mail train comes back
And I'll roll in my sweet baby's armsbluegreen and dappled

Makes me understand, questions my heart is asking
Who, opened my eyes, made me realize
Love is everlasting
Nobody but you, nobody but you
Nobody else, could love me, like you do
Nobody but you, could see me through
Your love is true and I donÃ¢??t need nobody but you
Who comes just close enough
And shows me that love is nothing to be afraid of
Who, holds me so tight every night
And shows me what love is made of
Nobody but you, nobody but you
Nobody else, could love me, like you do
Nobody but you, could see me through
Your love is true and I donÃ¢??t need nobody but youWay across town a phone rings off the wall
If you know he ain't home why do you keep callin'
You're gonna drive yourself crazy and you know that it's true
It's just making you wild and blue
Wild and blue it's no wonder
You look at the things that you do
They could just take you up to yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue
In somebody's room on the far side of town
With your minds all made up and the shades all pulled down
Someone is trying just to satisfy you
He don't know you're wild and you're blue
Wild and blue it's no wonder
You look at the things that you do
They could just take you up to yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue
It's four in the morning and you're all alone
With no place to go you know you ought to come home
And I'll be right here little baby waitin' for you
I know you've been wild and blue
Wild and blue and it's no wonder
You look at the things that you do
They could just take you up to yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue
And they ought to just take you up to yonder, honey
You're already wild and blueI'm a sad lonely man who walks in the night
Stopped here at your tavern it's the last one in sight
I have no destination I hope you won't mind
I'm a sad lonely man that love left behind
To me nothing matters there's no hope left within
The one love I live for is gone with the wind
These tears you see falling don't blame on the wine
I'm a sad lonely man that love left behind
[ steel ]
My clothes I have tattered but these lines in my face
Were put there by heartaches that time won't erase
I can't claim the future but the past is all mine
I'm a sad lonely man that love left behind
To me nothing matters...When The Morning Sun Streaks Across My Room
And I'm Waken Up From Another Dream Of You
When I'm On The Road, Once Again It Seems
All that's Left Behind, Is A Chain Of Broken Dreams
But You Know I Love You
Yes I Love You, Oh.... I Love You....
How I Wish That Love, was all We Need To Live
What A Life We'd Have, Cause I've Got So Much To Give
But It Seems So Wrong, Deep Inside My Heart
That The Dollar Sign Should Be Keeping Us Apart
But You Know I Love
Yes I Love You.....Ohhh I Love You
And If Only I Could Find My Way Back To The Time
When The Problems Of This Life it Did not Cross your Minds
And All The Answers could be Found In Children's Nursery Rhymes
And I'd Come Running Back To You, I'd Come Running Back To You
But You Know We Can't Live On Dreams Alone
And To Pay The Rent, I Must Leave You All Alone
And Though I Made My Choice Many Years Ago
And now This Traveling Life Is The Only One I Know
But You Know I Love You
Yes I Love You, Oh I Love You
But You Know I Love You
Yes I Love You, Oh I Love You...We wake up every morning,
In the early eyes of dawn
roll on out of bed, kiss,
And put the coffee on.
By 9 or 10 I feel as though,
I've worked a day or two
I close my eyes and dream about,
Spending time with you
Everyday I trade the simple things
for all their weight in gold
But they always leave me longing for
something more that I can hold
[Chorus]
We've got the house,
we always thought we needed
We've got everything the Jones' would dream of
We give all we've got
from 9 to 9
and think we've got it right
We got time to make a living,
Just no time to make a life.
If we woke up tomorrow,
And all of this was gone,
I know we'd have everything
we need to carry on
More and More I'm missing
the way things used to be
When all we ever had in life
was time for you and me
Still I trade the simple things for all their weight in gold,
And still they leave me longing for
something more that I can hold.
[Chorus]
We've got the house,
We always thought we needed
We've got everything the Jones' would dream of
We give all we've got
from 9 to 9
and think we've got it right
We got time to make a living,
Just no time to make a life.
It seems this world's gone crazy
Seems we've lost all sense of time.
We're all running a race
that has no Finnish line.
[Chorus]
We've got the house,
We always thought we needed
We've got everything the Jones' would dream of
We give all we've got
from 9 to 9
and think we've got it right
We got time to make a living,
Just no time to make a life.
Yah, time to make a living,
Just no time to make a life.
It's about time.
Time to make a life.
It's about you and me.Eighty-Nine Cents in the ash tray
Half empty bottle of Gatorade rolling in the floorboard
That dirty Braves cap on the dash
Dog tags hangin' from the rear view
Old Skoal can, and cowboy boots and a Go Army Shirt folded in the back
This thing burns gas like crazy, but that's alright
People got their ways of coping
Oh, and I've got mine
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
Til all the pain's a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes I drive your truck
I leave that radio playing
That same ole country station where ya left it
Yeah, man I crank it up
And you'd probably punch my arm right now
If you saw this tear rollin' down on my face
Hey, man I'm tryin' to be tough
And momma asked me this morning
If I'd been by your grave
But that flag and stone ain't where I feel you anyway
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
Til all the pain's a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes I drive your truck
I've cussed, I've prayed, I've said goodbye
Shook my fist and asked God why
These days when I'm missing you this much
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
Til all the pain's a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes, brother sometimes
I drive your truck
I drive your truck
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
I drive your truckI can see a long line of cars with their headlights on
I can see kinfolks cryin' cause somebody's gone
Then they gather around as it let the sinner men down
And I can see an old preacher prayin' with a frown
Lord is that me tell about this vision I see
Lord is that me if it is have mercy Lord have mercy on me
I can see an old grey haired woman say goodbye to her son
I can see a young widow bowed with a child in her arms
They stay as long as they should showin' what respect that they could
But everybody there was afraid to say something good
Lord is that me
I can see a long line of cars quickly drive away
I can see an old woman lingerin' behind by the grave
Her wrinkled face is streamin' tears as she stands there trembel in fear
'Cause only a chosen few can we took there
Lord is that me
I can see a long line of cars with their headlights onThe screen door slams, Mary's dress waves
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey, that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but, hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me
You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets
Well now, I ain't no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks
Oh oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road
Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken(Catherine Britt & Elton John)
A fire that's left unattended
Surely will burn out and die
Now that we're down to nothin' but ashes
Is this where we both say goodbye
Chorus
Is this where two hearts break down and cry
Is this where we let go and give up the fight
Have we reached the point where it's too late to try
Is this where we both say goodbye
It's so hard to go on pretendin'
The truth is we're livin' a lie
And it kills me to know our love's dyin'
Is this where we both say goodbye
(Chorus)Come and look out through the window
That big old moon is shinin' down
Tell me now don't it remind you
Of a blanket on the ground
Remember back when love first found us
We'd go slippin' out of town
And we'd love beneath the moonlight
On a blanket on the ground
I'll get the blanket from the bedroom
And we'll go walkin' once again
To that spot down by the river
Where our sweet love first began
Just because we are married
Don't mean we can't slip around
So let's walk out through the moonlight
And lay the blanket on the ground
Oh, remember how excited
We used to get when love was young
That old moon was our best buddy
We couldn't wait for night to come
Now you know you still excite me
I know you love me like I am
Just once more I wish you'd love me
On the blanket on the ground
I'll get the blanket from the bedroom
And we'll go walkin' once again
To that spot down by the river
Where our sweet love first began
Just because we are married
Don't mean we can't slip around
So let's walk out through the moonlight
And lay the blanket on the ground
Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Do do do do do doWe got really good at rollin' my old mans jeep out with the head lights off
While he was still asleep and we stayed out all night
'Cause we knew all the right roads yeah
We knew just where the cops didnt go
Yeah we had our hungry hearts beatin like thunder
We were kings of the summer on a double broken yellow line
Knew what life was all about had it all figured out
Like a mount and a dash board light
We were watchin the world go round in a nowhere town livin in a nowhere town map dot camelot lost and found in a nowhere town live livin in a nowhere town
Starts gettin late runnin' out of stars so you and your girl go find a place to park
Two hearts in a chevy
All you want to do is have a drink with a buddys on the bank of a river a little somethin' on a Saturday night
We were livin right smack dab in the middle of a nowhere town
Hhey hey
Nowhere town nowhere town
Oh oh
Nowhere townInstrumentalI'll play second fiddle
To your new love while it lasts
Just like all the others
I've played for in the past
Why can't I be a leader
And play your leading part?
Why must I always have to play
Second fiddle in your heart?
Play fiddle play
Will there never come a day
When I won't have to play the part
Of second fiddle to your heart?
Each time you find a new love,
You leave me here to cry
The teardrops tell a story,
Of a love that just won't die.
Like an early mornin' paper,
The news you get just parts
Why must I always have to play
Second fiddle to your heart?
Play fiddle play.
Will there never come a day
When I won't have to play the part
Of second fiddle to your heart?Tell me about your sister
I heard you went to see her
Does it seem like she's never been
So frayed around the edges
Did she seem so alone to you
Detached from all the others
So she told it to her brother
And you saw it all so clear
She needs to find
Someplace to hide out
She'll be alright
She'll take the time out
You're the only one
That ever told her
She had to get some help
To remind her of herself
Tell me about your sister
She's holding out a picture
Does she know what it means to you
All torn around the edges
Did she always seem so confused
Or did it come to know her
Did it come to take her over
Coming slowly through the years
She needs to find
Someplace to hide out
She'll be alright
She'll take the time out
You're the only one
That ever told her
She had to get some help
To remind her of herselfJohnnie, you've got your head in the clouds --
You've got me screaming out loud, but you can't hear me.
And Johnnie, I think you're blind to my pain --
You've got me going insane; I'm barely breathing.
And I've been setting off to go for how long --
I do not know.
I'm blowing dandelion kisses trying to turn weeds into wishes;
Trying to make rags into riches over you.
Should've stuck to stars instead, but now my face is turning red
and I remember -- as you always said:
"Don't hold your breath."
Johnnie, you just ain't worth the risk,
'Cuz I can't fix these growing pains.
And it's not funny --
You don't know what you're doing to me.
Johnnie, oh baby, it's not your fault.
And I've been setting off to go for how long --
I do not know.
I'm blowing dandelion kisses trying to turn weeds into wishes;
Trying to make rags into riches over you.
Should've stuck to stars instead, but now my face is turning red
and I remember -- as you always said:
Wish I may I wish I might
Not have the wish I wish tonight.
I'm blowing dandelion kisses trying to turn weeds into wishes;
Trying to make rags into riches over you.
Should've stuck to stars instead but now my face is turning red
and I remember -- as you always said:
"Don't hold your breath."
You see I'm stuck here, it's true --
Can't you see it's 'cuz of you.There is someone walking behind you turn around look at me
There is someone watching your footsteps turn around look at me
There is someone who really loves you here's my heart in my hand
Turn around look at me understand
That there is someone to stand beside you turn around look at me
There is someone to love and guide you turn around look at me
I've been waiting but I'll wait forever for you to come to me
Look at someone who really loves you turn around look at meSmall talk, cheap beer and wine
Easy women, wasted time
Another night with somebody he don't know
It's been the first and been the last
Got no future, had no past
A nameless face in somebody else's show
Riding the rodeo
He's a rodeo rider, sole survivor
Got to prove that he's the best
Rodeo rider, sole survivor
Got to be the fastest in the west
Cheyenne to San Antoine
Wild horses and women he's known
Have broken his heart and most of his bones
But today he's gonna ride again
Doin' everything he can to win
A nameless face but that's the only life that he's ever known
Riding the rodeo
He's a rodeo rider, sole survivor
Got to prove that he's the best
Rodeo rider, sole survivor
Got to be the fastest in the west
He's a rodeo rider, sole survivor
Got to prove that he's the best
Rodeo rider, sole survivor
Got to be the fastest in the westYou say you want to talk it over
Want to try again
But there's no way of workin' out
This love that we're not in
We could talk and talk and accomplish nothin'
We've tried it all before
It's time somebody did some walkin'
And I can see the door
So I'd just as soon go
I'd just as soon say goodbye
There's no reason to prolong
What we should just let die
And I'd just as soon stop
I'd just as soon end the madness
Knowin' what I know
I'd just as soon go
It's not an easy thing to do
Leavin' seldom ever is
But stayin' just to see us through
Just ain't no way to live
It's hard for you to understand
But we're better off this way
I can't fake it one more night
Or take it one more day
So I'd just as soon go
I'd just as soon say goodbye
There's no reason to prolong
What we should just let die
And I'd just as soon stop
I'd just as soon end the madness
Knowin' what I know
I'd just as soon go
Knowin' what I know
I'd just as soon goYou carry me along with you
Keep my spirit strong you do
Maybe I was meant to be
Under your lock and key
The hard times that I had
Really don't seem all that bad
Yesterday is long ago and far away
And I'm beginning to feel the years
But I'm going to be ok
As long as you're beside me along the way
Going to make it through the night
And into the morning light
There are things that I've said before
I don't mean them anymore
Yesterday is long ago and far away
And I'm beginning to feel the years
But I'm going to be ok
As long as you're beside me along the way
Going to make it through the night
And into the morning light
With angels by your side
The spirit's there to guide
I'm beginning to feel the years
But I'm going to be ok
As long as you're beside me along the way
Going to make it through the night
And into the morning lightDeep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San AntoneCowboys ain't never got no money their wild and livin' in a different world
They only care about their horse and saddle but a cowboy dosn't keep a steady girl
The cowboy's rope and ride and drink hard liquor they gamble givin' lady luck a whirl
They hit town well they ain't never stayin' cause a cowboy don't keep a steady girl
Cowboys ain't suppose to love one woman cause cowboys all got women by the score
Well if cowboys ain't suppose to love one woman I don't want to be a cowboy anymore
[ harmonica + piano ]
Well I've been ridin' herd for oh so long now
I've been gone on fourteen years and maybe more
But I've finally found a filly full of sunshine so I don't want to be a cowboy anymore
Cowboys ain't got time to raise a family cowboys don't work jobs or mine a store
Well if cowboys don't have time to raise a family
I don't want to be a cowboy anymore

'59 Cave Music
High on the mountain what do you see
Bear tracks bear tracks lookin' back at me
You better get your rifles boys before it's too late
The bear's got a little pig and headed through the gate
He's big around the middle and he's broad across the rump
Doin' ninety miles an hour takin' thirty feet a jump
He never been caught and he ain't never been treed some folks say looks a lot like me
I saved up my money and I bought me some bees
They started makin' honey way up in the trees
I chopped down the tree but my honey's all gone
Ole Slew Foot's done made himself at home
He's big around the middle...
Winter's comin' on and it's twenty below the river's froze over so where can he go
We'll chase him in the gully and we'll run him in the well
And shoot him at the bottom and we'll listen to him yell
He's big around the middle...Way down in Virginia
Amongst the tall grown sugar canes
Lived a simple man and a dominiker hen
And a rose of a different name.
Well, the first time I felt lightning
I was standing in the drizzling rain
With a trembling hand and a bottle of gin
And a rose of a different name.
Well, the devil made me do it the first time
The second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple headed man
And help me leave that black rose alone.
When the devil made that woman
Lord, she threw the pattern away
She was built for speed with the tools you need
To make a new fool every day.
Way down deep and dirty
On the darker side of shame
I caught a cane cuttin' man with a bottle of gin
With a rose of a different name.
The devil made me do it the first time
The second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple headed man
Help me leave that black rose alone.
The devil made me do it the first time
The second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple headed man
Help me leave that black rose aloneWell, I was born in a town called Audubon
Southwest Iowa, right where it oughta been
Twenty-three houses, fourteen saloons,
And a feed mill in nineteen-thirty.
Had a neon sign, said "Squealer Feeds"
And the bus came through when they felt the need
And they stopped at a place there in town called The Old Home Cafe
Now my daddy was a music lovin' man
He stood six-foot-seven, had big ol' hands
He'd lost two fingers in a chainsaw but he could still play the violin
And Mom played piana, just the keys in the middle
And Dad played a storm on his three-fingered fiddle
'Cause that's all there was to do back there folks, except ta go downtown and watch haircuts
So I was raised on Dust Bowl tunes, you see
Had a six-tube radio an' no TV
It was so dog-goned hot I had to wet the bed in the summer just to keep cool.
Yeah, many's a night I'd lay awake
A-waitin' for a distant station break
Just a-settin' and a-wettin' an' a-lettin' that radio fry.
Well, I listened to Nashville and Tulsa and Dallas
And Oklahoma City gave my ear a callus
And I'll never forget them announcers at three A.M.
They'd come on an' say "Friends, there's many a soul who needs us
"So send them letters an' cards ta Jesus
"That's J-E-S-U-S friends, in care a' Del Rio, Texas."
But the place I remember, on the edge a' town
Was the place where you really got the hard-core sound
Yeah, a place where the truckers used ta stop on their way to Dees Moins
There was signs all over them windowsills
Like "If the Devil don't get ya, then Roosevelt will"
And "The bank don't sell no beer, and we don't cash no checks."
Now them truckers never talked about nothin' but haulin'
And the four-letter words was really appallin'
They thought them home-town gals was nothin' but toys for their amusement.
Rode Chevys and Macks and big ol' stacks
They's always complainin' 'bout their livers an' backs
But they was fast-livin', strung-out, truck-drivin' son of a guns
Now the gal waitin' tables was really classy
Had a rebuilt motor on a fairly new chassis
And she knew how to handle them truckers; name was Mavis Davis
Yeah, she'd pour 'em a coffee, then she'd bat her eyes
Then she'd listen to 'em tell 'er some big fat lies
Then she'd ask 'em how the wife and kids was, back there in Joplin?
Now Mavis had all of her ducks in a row
Weighed ninety-eight pounds; put on quite a show
Remind ya of a couple a' Cub Scouts tryin' ta set up a Sears, Roebuck pup tent
There's no proposition that she couldn't handle
Next ta her, nothin' could hold a candle
Not a hell of a lot upstairs, but from there on down, Disneyland!
Now the truckers, on the other hand, was really crass
They remind ya of fingernails a-scratchin' on glass
A-stompin' on in, leavin' tracks all over the Montgomery Ward linoleum
Yeah, they'd pound them counters and kick them stools
They's always pickin' fights with the local fools
But one look at Mavis, and they'd turn into a bunch a' tomcats
Well, I'll never forget them days gone by
I's just a kid, 'bout four foot high
But I never forgot that lesson an' pickin' and singin', the country way
Yeah, them walkin', talkin' truck stop blues
Came back ta life in seventy-two

They line up at night time at the bar
They all once were lovebirds
Now bluebirds are all that they are
They landed in hell
The minute they fell from love's sky
And now they hope in the wine
That they'll find a new way to fly
A new way to fly
Far away from goodbye
Above the clouds and the rain
The memories and the pain
And the tears that they cry
Now the lesson's been learned
They've all crashed and burned
But they can leave it behind
If they could just find
A new way to fly
By the end of the night
They'll be high as a kite once again
And they don't seem to mind all the time
Or the money they spend
It's a high price to pay
To just find a way to get by
But it's worth every dime
If they find a new way to fly
A new way to fly
Far away from goodbye
Above the clouds and the rain
The memories and the pain
And the tears that they cry
Now the lesson's been learned
They've all crashed and burned
But they can leave it behind
If they could just find
A new way to fly
They'll leave it behind
As soon as they find
A new way to flySomething More Besides You
One foot stands before the crib
The other by the casket.
A question formed upon stilled lips
Is passed on but never asked.
I guess I believe that there's a point
In what we do.
But I ask myself is there
Something more besides you?
Two are born to cross
Their paths, their lives, their hearts.
If by chance one turns away
Are they forever lost?
I guess I believe that there's a point
To what we do.
But I ask myself is there
Something more besides you?
This morning I awoke,
The bed warm where it once was cold.
Small blessings laid upon us.
Small mysteries slowly unfold.
Yet I still wonder is there a point
To what we do?
'Cause I kind of doubt
That there is something more besides you.
Although it's hard to find the point
To what we do,
Do I dare believe that there is
Something more besides you?You say always treat people like you'd like to be
I guess you love being hated for your sexuality
You love when people put words in your mouth
About what you believe make you sound like a freak
'Cause if you really believed what you say you believe
You wouldn't be so damned reckless with the words you speak
You wouldn't silently consent when the liars speak
Denying all the dying of the remedy
Tell me, brother what matters more to you
Tell me, sister what matters more to you
If I can see what's in your heart by what comes out of your mouth
Then it sure looks to me like being straight is all it's about
It looks like being hated for all the wrong things
Like chasing the wind while the pendulum swings
'Cause we can talk and debate till we're blue in the face
About the language and tradition that He's coming to save
And meanwhile we sit just like we don't have give a shit
About fifty thousand people who are dying today
Tell me brother what matters more to you?
Tell me sister what matters more to you?There's a spot in me heart which no colleen may own
There's a depth in me soul never sounded or known
There's a place in my memory my life that you fill
(No other can take it) no one ever will
Sure I love the dear silver that shines in your hair
And the brow that's all furrowed and wrinkled with care
I kiss the dear fingers so toil-worn for me
Oh God bless you and keep you Mother machree
Every sorrow or care in the dear days gone by
Twas made bright by the light of the smile in your eye
Like a candle that's set in a window at night
(Your fond love has cheered me) and guided me right
Sure I love the dear silverAm I to face these lonely halls alone
And when you leave, who's gonna walk me home
Cause when you walk out the door I won't see you no more
And you're the one I adore so baby
Chorus:
Don't drop out of my life, baby, don't be a fool
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)
You're old enough to know you're too young to face the world so cruel
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)
You're not prepared to do anything
So if you wanna buy me that diamond ring, well
Don't drop out of my life, baby, don't drop out
My parents say you're lazy but you can be smart if you try
And I know you've got a heart cause you've never ever made me cry
They say you're no good so baby do what you should
And stay here by my side oh darlin'
Repeat Chorus
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)
Don't drop out of my life
Baby, don't drop out
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)Girl, you wear the hell out of that dress
I can hardly catch my breath
When I see you look this way
And I've been sitting here all night long
Waiting on your favorite song
It's finally starting to play
Baby, do you feel that bass line pumpin'
Tell me, can you hear that kick drum thumpin' on the 2 and 4
Let's get on that floor
Love to hear the slide of the guitar ringin'
Melody's saying everything I'm thinking
And I'm starting to
To think you think it too
I love the way you're movin'
Feel the back-beat groovin'
I wanna hold you to it
Damn, when you start to sway your hips
I start thinkin' about your lips
On mine and mine on them
And I love dancin' with you so much
I ask the DJ to turn it up
And keep playin' that song again,
And again and again
Baby, do you feel that bass line pumpin'
Tell me, can you hear that kick drum thumpin' on the 2 and 4
Let's get on that floor
Love to hear the slide of the guitar ringin'
Melody's saying everything I'm thinking
And I'm starting to
To think you think it too
I love the way you're movin'
Feel the back-beat groovin'
I wanna hold you to itYonder comes Willie the weeper
Saddest looking sight in all the town
Had a new love but couldn't keep her
Now Willie's crying heart is broken down
You should have seen the smiling face that Willie wore
The day he found the thrill of her embrace
For the first time in his whole life Willie fell in love
But I took the smile right off of Willie's face took his place
Yonder comes Willie the weeper
I put on the smiling face that Willie wore
And took her round for everyone to see
But she found someone else that she wanted more
Now Willis's smiling face laughs back at me look and see
I'm just like Willie the weeper
Saddest looking sight in all the town
Had a new love but couldn't keep her
Now mine and Willie's hearts are broken downI've got Sunday school to thank for Jesus,
Got educated thanks to mum and dad;
I can borrow money thank to banker Johnson
Thanks to me I've spent all that I have.
I quit smooking thanks to coach kwasky,
Thanks to lefty Thomson I can fight
It took a while learning all life's lessons,
But I learnt about love just one night.
Honey I've got you to thank for that
It's good from time to time to look back
It always reminds me that I love it where I am a a a
Honey I've got you to thank for that
Honey I've got you to thank for that.
Thanks to little Richard I felt craze,
J.S.B. makes me fell that I too was bad
Then my life took on a new dimension
Honey I've got you to thank for that
Honey I've got you to thank for thatThere's no more waiting
Holding out for love
You are my Godsend
That I have been forever dreaming of
My angel from above
Heaven knows
I'm head over heels and it shows
I've played every field I suppose
But there's something about you
When you're around
Baby I have found
I get lost in you
What is this feeling
I've never known before
That I should touch you
Swearing to surrender ever more
That's what I came here for
Heaven knows
I'm head over heels and it shows
I've played every field I suppose
But there's something about you
When you're around
Baby I have found
I get lost in a wonderful daze
Lost in your wonderful ways
Heaven knows
When you're around
Baby I have found
I get lost
Heaven knows
I'm head over heels and it shows
I've played every field I suppose
But there's something about you
When you're around
Baby I have found
I get lost in youI can hardly bear the sight of lipstick
On the cigarettes there in the ashtray
Lyin' cold the way you left them
But at least your lips caressed them while you packed
And a lip print on a half-filled cup of coffee that you poured and didn't drink
But at least you thought you wanted it, that's so much more than I can say for me
It's been a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
Funny, I don't even care
When you turned and walked away
And as the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses
After three full years of marriage
It's the first time that you haven't made the bed
I guess the reason we're not talkin', there's so little left to say we haven't said
While a million thoughts go runnin' through my mind, I find I haven't spoke a word
And from the bedroom those familiar sounds of our one baby's cryin' goes unheard
But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
Funny, I don't even care
And when you turned and walked away
As the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the rosesI'm holdin' to the Lord
I'm holdin' to the Lord
Oh, if I could I surely would stand on the rock
Where Moses stood
Sinners run and hide your face
Sinners run and hide your face
Go runnin' to the rock and hide your face
Lord, I ain't, no stranger now
I'm holdin' to the Lord
I'm holdin' to the Lord
Oh, if I could I surely would stand on the rock
Where Moses stood
Lord, I ain't no stranger now
Lord, I ain't no stranger now
I've introduced to and followed in the sun
Lord, I ain't no stranger nowI went across the river, I lay down to sleep
I went across the river, I lay down to sleep
When I woke up had shackles on my feet
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long
Twenty-one links of chain around my leg
Twenty-one links of chain around my leg
And on each link is initial of a man
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long
If anyone should asked you who composed this song
If anyone should asked you who composed this song
Just say it was I, I'll sing it all day long
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now but I won't be worried longYou've been hiding in the corners
You've been living all your life
You gotta get out to the country
And leave your troubled mind
'cause you're not free
You're not free
You left your baby and guessing
Don't know when you'll be back
You can't hold down a job
You can't even pay your rent
'cause you're not free
You're not free
You gonna go down to the water
And lay down in the tide
You'll lay your body down
And cry and cry and cry
Till you're free
Till you're freeTis sweet to be remembered on a bright or gloomy day
Tis sweet to be remembered by a dear one far away
Tis sweet to be remembered remembered remembered
Tis sweet to be remembered when you are far away
As I travel on this world just to soothe my rovin' mind
The messages I get from a dear one left behind
They were filled with sweetest words that's so touchely when I heard
Never ever can I forget these are some things that she said
Tis sweet to be rememberedI've got a quarter in my pocket won't you tell me what I should do?
Should I put it in the phone so I can come crawling home to you
Or should I put it in the jukebox and play another heartbreak song
Well I'm leaning towards the latter and I really hate being alone
Gonna flip it in the air, gonna watch it fly
If it's heads I might love again, if it's tails I'll cry
I've got a quarter in my pocket won't you tell me what I should do?
Should I put it in the phone so I can come crawling home to you
Or should I put it in the jukebox and play another heartbreak song
Well I'm leaning towards the latter and I really hate being alone
Here I am again on the same ol' stool
With the same ol' question at hand and the mind of a foolThe ladies began to loose their smile
Sat on their porches and watched her walk her first long mile
tight long jeans and short blond hair
Every man couldn&apos;t help but stare
my momma told me to stay away
warned me that girls like her never stay
but her eyes are as blue as the sea
but my heart starts to pinch when she looks at me when she looks at me
she&apos;s a hot lovin&apos; lady
What&apos;s wrong with that
she&apos;s a smart talking lady
what&apos;s wrong with that what&apos;s wrong with that
Before I knew it we were laughing away
the sun went down it turned into another day
she said that she loved me
carved our names into the trunk of a tree
weeks past and things dissolved
Wasn&apos;t much for anyone to try and solve
my momma was right and i was wrong
tried to play the game and it didn&apos;t last all that longI'm hearing funny stories and they're far from being true
But you know how talk gets around
Those busy tongues are wagging saying I walked out on you
But you know how talk gets around
I must admit our romance wasn't all that it should be
We tried to claim a love we'd never found
They say you're living reckless and they're blaming it on me
But you know how talk gets around
I hear you're glad we parted that you're saying you don't care
Now you know how talk gets around
They're telling everybody that I didn't treat you fair
And you know how talk gets around
I wish I wasn't quite so proud when I'm around with friends
Then I wouldn't feel so honor bound
I'd give the world to tell them how I'd love to make amends
But you know how talk gets aroundMonday mornin' is such a rush
Here it is again sneakin' up on us
Uh-huh-huh yeah
This is the part you know I don't like
We say goodbye and then we kiss goodnight
Uh-huh-huh yeah
I know it's one o'clock
And we said you'd be gone by ten
So much for those eight hours
I swore that I'd get in
I know I should get some sleep
I'm at the beginnin' of another long week
But I don't want you to go
No I don't want you to go
I guess another minute wouldn't do no harm
Why not spend it in each other's arms
Cause I don't want you to go
No I don't want you to go
We always say just one more kiss
But it always seems to never end like this
Uh-huh-huh yeah
A few dozen then a couple more
Before we know it it's after four
Uh-huh-huh yeah
I know tomorrow my best friend will be my coffee cup
Cause here we go again
Watchin' the sun come up
Yeah, I know I should get some sleep
I'm at the beginnin' of another long week
But I don't want you to go
No I don't want you to go
I guess another minute wouldn't do no harm
Why not spend it in each other's arms
Cause I don't want you to go
No baby, I don't want you to go
Hey
I know tomorrow my best friend will be my coffee cup
Cause here we go again
Watching the sun come up yeah
I know I should get some sleep
I'm at the beginnin of another long week
But I don't want you to go
No I don't want you to go
I guess another minute wouldn't do no harm
Why not spend it in each other's arms
Yeah I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to goI couldn't sleep last night, just walk the floor
Don't know how I'll stand this anymore
Lonely all the time since I lost you
Received your invitation to the blues
I don't know why you cause me such pain
I just hope I'll never go through this much again
[Chorus]
Thanks for sending something I can't use
I received your invitation to the blues
You took the laughter from this world of mine
Thanks to you the sun will never shine
Walked the floor so much, wore out my shoes
Received your invitation to the blues
I don't know why you cause me such pain
I just hope I'll never go through this much again
Lonely me, I don't know what to do
I received your invitation to the blues
[Chorus]Send some roses to Reno maybe it's not too late
If the roses reach Reno maybe baby will wait
Baby's gone she's out of sight it all happened over night
But how long I should have stayed and that was yesterday before I'd found
Baby's Reno bound
Send some roses to Reno...
Never thought she'd say goodbye guess my thoughts were all a lie
Baby smiled on me for just a little while and baby let me down
Baby's Reno boundJust one more dance, just one more chance
So I can talk to you
Don't live too fast, forget the past
I will try to prove
I would do anything you ask me to
Don't run around, don't turn me down
Let me talk to you
Don't go too far with that crowd at the bar
That's not the way to win, please fall in love again
Give me your heart so I can start to build our life anew
I know you've paid, so if you're afraid, let me talk to you
Don't go too farDaylight has found me here again
You can ask me anything, but where I've been
Things that used to matter seem so small
When you're looking for a soft place to fall
Don't misunderstand me, baby, please
I didn't mean to bring back memories
You should know the reason why I called
I was looking for a soft place to fall
Looking for a soft place
Nothing more than a small taste
Of a love that ended long ago
Looking for a place to hide
A warm bed on a cold night
I didn't mean to hurt you
No, no, no
Looking out your window at the dawn
Baby, when you wake up, I'll be gone
You're the one who taught me after all
How to find a soft place to fallOh what a wonderful happy day up there on the golden strand
When I can hear Jesus my Saviour say shake hands with mother again
She never closed her eyes at night till we were all in bed
On partly nights till we came home she often sat and read
We little thought about it then when we were young and gay
How much mama worried when we children were away
We only knew she never slept when we were out at night
And that she waited just to know that we come home all right
Why sometimes we stayed out till one two or three
And it seemed to us that mama heard the turning of the key
For always when we stepped inside she'd call and we'd reply
But we were all too young back then to understand just why
Until the last one had reuturned she always kept the light
For mama couldn't sleep until she kissed us all goodnight
She had to know that we were safe before she went to rest
She seemed to fear the world might harm the ones she loved the best
And once she said when you have grown to women and to men
Perhaps I'll sleep the whole night through I may be different then
And so it seemed that night or day we knew a mother's care
That always we got back home we'd find her waiting there
Then came the night when we were called together around her bed
The children all are with you now the kindly doctor said
And in her eyes there gleamed again the old time tender light
That told that she had been waiting just to know we were all right
She smiled the old familiar smile then prayed to God to keep
A safe from harm throughout the years and then she went to sleep
Shake hands with mother againIt's been a blue, blue day
I feel like runnin' away
I feel like runnin' away from it all
My love has been untrue
She's found somebody new
It's been a blue, blue day for me
I feel like cryin', dying'
What can I do
Fell like praying', sayin'
I'm glad we're through
It's been a blue, blue day
I feel like runnin' away
I feel like runnin' away from the blues
I cannot make believe
That I don't sit and grieve
It's been a blue, blue day for me
I can't pretend and say
That I don't love her anyway
It's been a blue, blue day for me
I feel like cryin', dying'
What can I do
Fell like praying', sayin'
I'm glad we're through
It's been a blue, blue day
I feel like runnin' away
I feel like runnin' away from the blues.You're lookin' for someone
Whose got it all to give
You're lookin' for someone
Who won't care how you live
You're lookin' for someone
Who won't need a love from you
I ain't the one, I ain't the one
I ain't the one, I ain't the one
Lookin' for someone
Dry your tears when you cry
Lookin' for someone
Turn his back each time you lie
You lookin' for someone
Who walk on when you walk by
But I ain't the one, I ain't the one
I ain't the one, I ain't the one
I ain't the one who lets you do
What you want to
I ain't the one who sits still
Let's you be untrue
I ain't the one who know I am lovin' you
No matter what you do
I ain't the one, I ain't the one
I ain't the one, I ain't the one
I just keep lookin' further down the road
Try to find yourself someone
Who likes walkin' along
Someone you play with
And leave you dead by the road
I ain't the one, I ain't the one
I ain't the one, I ain't the one
I ain't the one, I ain't the one...Well I've been sitting here just thinking
Dealing with my feelings about leaving
Trying to keep from drinking
And every day I pray that I make it through one more day
Without giving in to the only friend who can take the pain away
Man believe me it would be easy
Cause I could go there
It wouldn't get me nowhere
Just a shot it all it takes to bring her back
And when the bottle's empty
It will only leave me
Holding on to nothing more than memory and a glass
You see there ain't no future pouring good whiskey on the past
So what am I doing here
I know it don't make sense
Everybody knows a bar and a broken heart
Are two things that just don't mix
But I can't go home
Oh the thought of being there alone
With a bottle on the shelf
Saying go and help yourself
Man I know I'm not that strong
Man believe me, cause it would be easy
Well I could go there
But it wouldn't get me nowhere
Just a shot is all it takes to bring her back
And when the bottle's empty
It will only leave me
Holding on to nothing more than memory and a glass
See there ain't no future pouring good whiskey on the pastRed dress, spilled wine
Caught in a stupid fight
He's wrong, she's right
(No kiss goodnight)
Ring ring, telephone
Act like I'm not home
Can't hear the tears cry
(On the other end of the line)
And the minutes turn to hours
And they're flying like a jet plane
And we'll make it right tomorrow
But tomorrow's not a sure thing
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Away
Always hanging on the wall
No, it don't care at all
It won't slow down; it won't wait
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
It's ticking away
Head's scared, heart broke
Burned from a band of gold
Rather just be alone
(Burns, just a bad joke)
Bang bang on a drum
You're not a setting sun
You ain't even close to done
(Run, baby, run run)
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Away
Always hanging on the wall
No, it don't care at all
It won't slow down, it won't wait

Kiss me goodnight

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away

I'm wrong, you're right)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away)
Clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking awayShe moved into my old apartment
That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that I had mail
Waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face
With my own destiny
Ohh, and we sat there talkin'
Just like we were old friends
And ohh, then I asked her
"Can I see you again?"
She said, "Yes" and I said, "Wow"
And she said "When?" and I said, "How about right now?"
Love can't wait, then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said "Yes"
The days flew by just like a fast train
And nothing else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me
The man I wanna be
And she's the one I want for a million reasons
Loving her it's just like breathing
It's easy and it obvious
She was made for me
Ohh, then it happened one night
Looking in her eyes
Ohh, and I popped the question
Much to my surprise
She said, "Yes" and I said, "Wow"
And she said "When?" and I said, "How about right now?"
Love can't wait, then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said "Yes"
So we called the preacher
Family, and friends
And nothing's been the same
Since
She said, "Yes" and I said, "Wow"
And she said "When?" and I said, "How about right now?"
Love can't wait, then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said "Yes", she said "Yes"Ever since I met you girl, you been on my brain
I can't think of nothing else but you all night and day
It's like I got a first class seat up on Ozzy's train
It's driving me insane

When we're down to the final negotiations

I feel an urgent need for us to incorporate
Don't need Kreskin here to tell us just what we're gonna do
Hey, pay attention boy, I'm talkin' to you

Come here you, I love to hear you talk that talk

Now he's living at the foot of the cross
He testified on the main drag this evening
Said he's gonna spread the gospel to the lost
The meanest sinner to ever live and breathe
Said he's been clean and sober for a week
He said his soul is not troubled anymore
He hocked his gun and gave the money to the lord
Go tell the sheriff, john roland wood's found jesus
At a tent revival right outside of town
Oh what a friend this town has in jesus
If you look at what john roland has tore down
Before the spirit touched his soul
He kept the streets signs full of bullet holes
Back then when he was raising hell
You knew he was coming by the blue lights on this tail...look out
Go tell the sheriff, john roland wood's found jesus
Now that water tower must be full of wine
Let not your weary heart be troubled
Turn your women and your children back outside
What will we do on friday nights
Without john roland shootin' out the lights
Carry that ol' jukebox away
He traded b-9 for amazing grace
Go tell the sheriff, john roland wood's found jesus
Now he's living at the foot of the crossThe clickety sound of the southbound freight
And the high speed hum of a passenger train
Becomes a part of the soul and a heart and the mind
Of a boy who's raised by the railroad line
The sound of a whistle at the crossin' road
And the tanks and the trucks and the tractors on the flatcar load
Becomes a part of the soul and a heart and the mind
Of a boy who's raised by the railroad line
And the big round penny that you lay on the rails
And the wheels mash flat
And a glimpse of the faces of the ladies
And the picture of the men in the engineer's hat
And the brakeman waves from the red caboose
He's a part of the past, never quite turns loose
It's a part of the soul and a heart and the mind
Of a boy who's raised by the railroad line
And the big round penny that you lay on the rails
And the wheels mash flat
And a glimpse of the faces of the ladies
And the picture of the men in the engineer's hat
And the brakeman waves from the red caboose
He's a part of the past, never quite turns loose
It's a part of the soul and a heart and the mind
Of a boy who's raised by the railroad line
The clickety sound of the southbound freight
And the high speed hum of a passenger train
Becomes a part of the soul and a heart and the mind
Of a boy who's raised by the railroad linePretty little baby, lying in a manger
Staring at the strangers, who've come so many miles
They were told to follow the star up in the heavens
And it brought them to the stable of the little baby child
Could this be the kingdom of the high and mighty
Is this the ruler, born here tonight
Should we lay our treasures, here by the cradle
Oh you must be the Savior, pretty little baby child
Sometimes the greatest of miracles
Come from the smallest of things
They knew when they knelt there beside him
They were looking in the eyes of a king
And that his tiny little fingers would bring us together
For ever and ever, pretty little baby child
Wonder of wonders, there in the darkness
The light of the promise, how it shines from his eyes
The angels were singing the hallelujah chorus
To the Savior before us. Pretty little baby child
Sometimes the greatest of miracles
Come from the smallest of things
They knew when they knelt there beside him
They were looking in the eyes of a king
And that his tiny little fingers would bring us together
For ever and ever, pretty little baby child
For ever and ever pretty little baby childGive when you give the best of your service
Telling the world that the Saviour has come
Be not dismay if man don't believe you he'll understand and say well done
Oh when I come to the end of my journey weary of life and the battle is won
Caring the staff and the cross of redemption he'll understand and say well done
[ guitar ]
Oh when I come...WRITERS DON WILLIAMS, CHARLES COCHRAN, DAVID POMEROY
Which way is Santa Fe, New Mexico
I've got some things to say, she needs to know
Small brown adobe there, where lives my heart
I just can't make it here, with us apart
Which way is Santa Fe, New Mexico
There was a dream I had, I had to see
Salt of the ocean breeze, calling to me
So much for me to do, so much to be
Where is the dream I had, what do I see
How can so much so right, be wrong
Why should you have to leave
To know where you belongWritten by Jimmie Rodgers

Last night as I lay on the boxcar
Just waiting for a train to pass by
What will become of the hobo
Whenever his time comes to die
There's a Master up yonder in heaven
Got a place that we might call our home
Will we have to work for a living
Or can we continue to roam
Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride
Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies hidden up there
Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride
Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for the hobo

At last I have called up with you and you're a sight to see
Could this really be my outlaw lover JJ Sneed
Could a woman with a painted face and pretty sweet disguise
Turn your heart against me with her evil cunning eyes her evil cunning eyes
JJ it's been you and me right from the very start
And ever job we ever pulled I'd always done my part
We'd really stick together until the bitter end
And it was my understanding we were whole lots more than friends
A whole lot more than friends
And it was me that kept you on when nights were dark and cold
But I guess I didn't look like much in these old ragged clothes
But you said it didn't matter cause you love me that a way
You said that no one else could ever steal your heart away steal your heart away
Do you recall the Union Bank we robbed in Franklin Town
And as we made our getaway the sheriff gunned you down
And I doctored up your bullet wounds and nursed you while you sit
But now you have betrayed me is that the thanks I get is that the thanks I get
Oh yeah JJ I'm thinking now of how we'd all begun
Of all the times we've robbed and killed with our trust wordy gun
Why we stood off a fuss it was JJ just you and I
But now you have betrayed me and for that you're gonna die
Yeah for that you're gonna die
The good old days are over as we stand here in the rain
JJ I'm gonna shoot you now I hope you'll feel no pain
I hear whoopees of the horses and fieces on my trail
I guess I'll join you soon but for now JJ farewell for now JJ farewellThere once was a time when I was dead inside
I cussed the Lord for the day I was born
And prayed to the Devil to die
Just when I thought the Devil had won
Someone opened up the door
The King of kings
Lord of lords
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor
[Chorus]
Now, he broke the chains that bound me, and now I'm free
Today I'm right where Mama
Prayed I'd be
I'm down on my knees
Now I believe
What Mama knew for sure
He's King of kings
Lord of lords
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor
Now, if you're in trouble friend, let me tell you what to do
I'll tell you what he's done for me
And I know what he'll do for you
It makes no difference what you've done
You've a friend in the One that I adore
The King of kings
Lord of lords
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor
[Chorus]Under the snow
Beneath the frozen streams
There is life
You'll have to know
When nature sleeps she dreams
There is life
And the colder the winter
The warmer the spring
The deeper the sorrow
The more our hearts sing
Even when you can't see it
Inside everything
There is Life...
Oh....
After the Rain
The sun will reappear
There is life
After the pain
The joy will still be here
There is life
For it's out of the darkness
That we learn to see
And out of the silence
That songs come to be
And all that we dream of
Awaits patently
There is life
There is lifeHe was born in the Bitterroot Valley in the early morning rain
Wild geese over the water heading north and home again
Bringing a warm wind from the south
Bringing the first taste of the spring
His mother took him to her breast and softly she did sing
Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
His mother died that summer and he never learned to cry
He never knew his father and he never did ask why
He never knew the answers that would make an easy way
But he learned to know the wilderness and to be a man that way
His mother's brother took him in to family and his home
Gave him a hand that he could lean on and a strength to call his own
And he learned to be a farmer and he learned to love the land
And he learned to read the seasons and he learned to make a stand
Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
On the eve of his 21st birthday he set out on his own
He was 30 years and running when he found his way back home
Riding a storm across the mountains and an aching in his heart
Said he came to turn the pages and to make a brand new start
Now he never told a story of the time that he was gone
Some say he was a lawyer, some say he was a John
There was something in the city that he said he couldn't breathe
And there was something in the country that he said he couldn't leave
Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
Now some say he was crazy and they're glad that he is gone
But some of us miss him and we'll try to carry on
Giving a voice to the forest, giving a voice to the dawn
Giving a voice to the wilderness and the land that he lived on
Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skiesI, lost my way
But found today
Somebody needed me
Needed me to open up the door, closed before
That's what I'm here for
Now could you help me
Find my way back home
So leave a light on
Leave a light on for me
And I will shine
And maybe then I could see
You are my destiny
You and I keep love alive till the last tear is cried
For all time, you're a friend of mine
And I want to thank you
I thank you for always being there
Anywhere where only fools would dare
And now here I am my friend
Reaching out my hand needing you again
So leave a light on
Leave a light on for me
So I will shine
And maybe then I can see
That you are my destiny
You and I keep love alive till the last tear is cried
So leave a light on
Leave a light on for me, yeah
And I will shine
And maybe then I could see
That you are my destiny
You and I keeping love alive till the last tear I cry
Leave a light on
Leave a light on
Maybe then I could see
That you are my destiny( Edith Frost EP )
I'm tired of thinking so hard
You wanna argue out
Angles that you've thought about
I'm tired of fighting for air
I'm gonna rest my eyes
For just a little while
I'd rather blame you
And make it go away
I'd rather put it in my pocket
Maybe I'm feeling the strain of these times
Ask if I'm alright
I'm gonna close my eyes awhile
I'm taking some time to decide
You won't ask me twice
Are you still my baby tonight?
I'd rather blame you
And make it go away
I'd rather put it in my pocket
Don't go off and leave me
Don't go off and leave me
You've seen the damage you've made
I'm tired of thinking so hard
You wanna talk about
Angles that you've thought about and
I'm tired of fighting for air
I'm gonna close my eyes
For just a little while
I'd rather blame you
And just be done with it
I won't consider my involvement
Don't go off and leave me
Don't go off and leave me
You've seen the damage you've made
I'd rather blame you
And make it go away
I'd rather put it in my pocket
I'm blameless nowThe blanket fell from the window and let the sun shine in
The hardest part of starting over is where to begin
You wanted the world but it was more than I could give
I fell short of expectations but thats just the way it is
Just turn and walk away, dont let me hear you say
That I'm an empty man, full of empty plans
You can't say I didnt try, I'm not an empty man
It's the first day of summer, there's a cool wind blowing in
Solid year of bad whether is wearing me thin
The stories of my weakness are starting to get old
Go find the man I should have been 'cause tonight its getting cold
Just turn and walk away, dont let me hear you say
That I'm an empty man, full of empty plans
Just because you're not satisfied doesnt mean that I didnt try
Oh, I'm not an empty manEverything's Okay (Chris Jonat)
You think you think you think too much
But it's not about when, it's all about what
If you use your eyes and forsake your touch
You might hit for average but you'll choke in the clutch
You wonder you wonder wonderful things
So far beyond your reasoning
You throw back your head you start to sing
But you catch yourself, you get your bearings why did you need your bearings?
You believe believe belief's beyond you
Belief belongs to the blessed few
You divine water and hope and the blues
But it don't mean much when it don't ring true
You worry you worry words won't work
When winged wonders wonder what you're worth
You have strong suspicions and you'd like to be sure
If words make you sick there must be a cure why don't you take the cure?
Hey, everything's okay
Put those other thoughts away
Let me hear you say, at least for today
Everything's okay
(Live so you live the life you're leading
If you lose the groove don't move the groove's repeating
If you come undone it's from the words you're heeding)
You've seen you've seen scenes so serene
Like red makes you rage but you sleep to green
And you try to determine what it could mean
That it's full and rich but pure and lean
And you sigh size up your surroundings
See the colors and all that they bring
You try to choose from all the offerings
You get right rooted, thinking of your bearings but then you start to sing
If you want to improve
Get your mind into a groove
And let it play
All that you have to do
Is get your mind into that groove
And try to keep it that wayYou left me and you went away
You said you'd be back and just that day
You've broken your promise and you left me here alone
I don't know why you did dear, but I do know that you're gone
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
Now darling you know I love you well
I love you more than I can ever tell
I thought that you loved me and always would be mine
But you went and left me here with troubles on my mind
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
Now someday you may be lonesome too
Walking the floor is good for you
Just keep right on walking and it won't hurt you to cry
Remember that I love you and I will the day I die
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks in two
Walking the floor over youWhen I look out over a green field of clover
Or watch the sun set at the end of the day
I get kind of moody when I see such beauty
And everything's beautiful in its own way
When I see a fountain flow from a mountain
Or see April showers bring flowers to May
I can't help but ponder; life is such a wonder
And everything's beautiful in its own way
Words can't describe what I feel inside
When I see the beauty in each coming day
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold
And everything's beautiful in its own way
When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger
The storm's even beautiful in its own way
When I see leaves drop off from the treetop
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder
God made all things beautiful in their own wayI said goodbye to the state line of Wyoming
And four hundred miles of friends along the way
I know tomorrow I'll wake up feelin' lonesome
'Cause there's a part of me that's wishin' I could stay
From the sage of Cheyenne on up north to Cody
I've drifted like a rollin' tumbleweed
And a thousand pair of eyes and smiles that know me
Are cryin' every time I turn to leave
And though I've heard New Mexico is magical
Chicago town can make you fall in love again
You can keep your beaches in Hawaii
I'll take the Wyoming Wind
Sometimes I dream of life out on the range
Pushin' cattle 'cross the Great Divide
And every time I smell that springtime sage
I get this wild feelin' deep inside
And I long to be where I can see the mountains
Stretchin' 'cross that never-ending sky
Or standin' on the banks along the mighty Bighorn River
Listenin' to the water roll on by
And though I've heard the sun sets over California
The Smoky Mountains seem like an old friend
You can keep your dusty Texas plains
I'll take the Wyoming wind
Can you hear that lonesome coyote howlin'
I think I know just how he feels
Because it's down the road and far from here I wander
But I know I'll be comin' back again
'Cause all I am and all I ever hope to be
Is somewhere in that Wyoming wind
Somewhere in that Wyoming windDon't walk away from me darling is that the way it has to be darling
Can't we start our love anew don't tell me our love is through
Oh darling please don't walk away
Now that you want to go darling I realize I love you so darling
Don't turn your back on me I don't want to be set free
Oh darling please don't walk away
I know now I put everything above you so how were you to really know I love you
Yes I was blind but now I see that you say you still love me
And darling please don't walk away
Don't walk away from me darling is that the way it has to be darling
Can't we start our love anew don't tell me our love is through
Oh darling please don't walk away my darling tell me that you'll stayI wish, I wish my baby was born
Sittin on her mama's knee
But you, poor girl are dead and gone
And grass is growing over thee.
Oh I'm not no saint, no I never shall be
Til the sweet apple grows on a sour apple tree
Still I hope that the day will come
When you and I will walk as one.
I wish I wish my baby was born
Sittin on her papa's knee
But you poor girl are dead and gone
And grass growing over thee.Sittin in the morning sun,
I`ll be sittin' when the evening come,
Watching the ships roll in,
And I'll watch 'em roll away again, yeah,
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay,
Watching the tide roll away, ouh,
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay,
Wasting time.
I left my home in Georgia,
Headed for the Frisco bay
I have nothing to live for,
Look like nothings gonna come my way,
So I'm just go sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away,
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay,
Wasting time
Look like nothings gonna change,
Everything still remain the same,
I can't do what ten people tell me to do,
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes,
Sittin' here resting my bones,
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, yes,
Two thousand miles I roam
Just to make this dock my home
Now I'm just go sit at the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away, ooh
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wasting timeWith Jesus I would ever be, his matchless name, adore.
Hes done so very much for me, I want to love him more.
I want to love him more, I want to love him more,
I want to love him more, I do, I do, I do.
I want to love him more, I want to love him more,
Hes done so much for me.
He died upon the cruel tree. Our load of guilt He bore.
He suffered shame for you and me. I want to love him more.
Chorus:
His children he will not forsake, when troubles press them sore.
But in their soul sweet peace awakes, I want to love him more.
Chorus:
O Prince of life, sweet Prince of peace Who dwelt on earth below;
My faith in Him will never cease, I want to love Him more.Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring
When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win
Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you
The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flowWell when I was a little bitty boy no bigger than an old polecat
Well I used to wonder like all kids what made this to that
Now I'd seen what happened to my pa when he take a drink from a jug
Yeah he'd start with a smile and then after awhile he'd be out on the floor like rug
Corn liquor (corn liquor) corn liquor (corn liquor) what makes you do what you do
Well they feel no pain when you touch their brain corn liquor they love you
[ banjo ]
Well now one day in the afternoon my folks were away for awhile
Yeah I got the jug down from the shelf to see what made 'em smile
Now I slowly sip in the nearly flip that one drink was enough
For the life of me I just can't see why they love that awful stuff
Corn liquor (corn liquor)...
[ fiddle ]
Well as I grew older I thought about that first sip that I had
Yeah I really burned and soon I learned it wasn't all that bad
Now to ease the pressures of this world here's the way I've got it figured
Well the thing to do for me and you is drink lotsa good corn liquor
Corn liquor (corn liquor)...
Yeah I feel no pain when you touch my brain corn liquor I love youNow,
Don't just walk away
Pretending everything's okay and you don't care about me
And I
Know it's just no use
When all your lies become your truths and I don't care
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy now ooh, ooh, ooh
Would you tell it to my face
Or have I been erased are you happy now? Ooh, ooh, ooh
Are you happy now?
You, took all there was to take
And left me with an empty plate and you don't care about it
Yeah
And I
Am giving up this game
And leaving you with all the blame 'cause I don't care
Yeah yeah yeah
Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy now? Ooh, ooh, ooh
Would you tell it to my face
Or have I been erased are you happy now? ooh, ooh, ooh
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now? Yeah yeah yeahh
Do you really have everything you want
You could never give something you ain't got
You can't run away from yourself
Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy now yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah
Come on tell it to my face
Or have I been erased are you happy now? Yea-yea, yeah
Yeah, ho-ho yea-yea ho-ho
Could you look me in the eye
Could you look me in the eye
I've had I that I can take,
I'm not about to break 'cause I'm happy now ooh, ooh, ooh
Are you happy now?They talk about the golden rule but if I'd give a helping hand
They'll laugh and say I'm just a fool I guess I'll never understand
My friends all wished the best for me but when success was in my hand
They turned away in jealousy I guess I'll never understand
Then I found you and at last I knew
Our love was real if nothing else was true
Then I believed in life once more and all the lovely things we planned
And now you're walking off the door I guess I'll never understandSome walk out winners of those who've lost
Can it be said at any price this is the cost
Hard is perception, easier is blame
Is this the only life for everyone
Isn't it the same
Children laugh and run away
While others look into the darkness of the day
Some streets are easy while some are cruel
Could these be reasons why man
Is life's greatest fool
Do you believe when you're all alone
You held the key to your destiny gone
Do you believe in your soul
That too much loneliness makes you grow old
Words can be empty though filled with sound
Stoned numb and drifting, hard to be profound
Formed out of pleasure, chiseled by pain
Never the highest and not the last one to gainHere we are again and you sure look fine
You smile at me and the sparks just fly
I can't understand why this is taking so long
Somebody must have really done you wrong
'Cause everytime I reach for you,
You hold back and I'm so confused
How can you pull away from something so strong
Somebody must have really done you wrong
He hurt you bad, and your heart still aches
But why should we pay for his mistakes
Ohhh why
I don't know what he did but he's long gone
Well he must have really done you wrong
'Cause everytime I reach for you,
You hold back and I'm so confused
How can you pull away from something so strong
Somebody must have really done you wrong
I wanna tear down the walls that you built up
And baby open your heart to all my love
everytime I reach for you,
You hold back and I'm so confused
How can you pull away from something so strong
Somebody must have really, really
Somebody must have really done you wrong
somebody must have really done you wrong
Somebody must have really done you wrong
Done you wrong, really, really, really done you wrongThere's a white Christmas in my hometown
Where the streets are snowy, shinin' bright
And the lights on all the Christmas trees are burning
For old Santa's sure to come this very night
There are jingle bells and Christmas carols singin'
By the children who are walking in the street
Folks are smiling and they're sayin' merry Christmas
For there's joy in their hearts as they meet
Oh, the Christmas chimes are ringing in the tower
Jingle bells can be heard all around
Time for all to go and wait for Santa's comin'
'Cause it's merry Christmas here in my hometown
I can hear the reindeer in the distance
All the sleigh bells are ringing loud and clear
Little eyes are closed in their slumber
They are waiting for old Santa to appearI have seen snow that fell in May
And I have seen rain on cloudless days
Somethings are always bound to change
There ain't no ash will burn
Love is a precious thing I'm told
It burns just like West Virginia Coal
But when the fire dies down it's cold
There ain't no ash will burn
You say this life is not your lot
Well i can't be someone that I'm not
We can't stoke a fire that we ain't got
There ain't no ash will burn
Love is a precious thing I'm told
It burns just like West Virginia Coal
But when the fire dies down it's cold
There ain't no ash will burn
In every life there comes a time
When there are no more tears to cry
We must leave someone dear behind
There ain't no ash will burn
Love is a precious thing I'm told
It burns just like West Virginia Coal
But when the fire dies down it's cold
There ain't no ash will burnI listened when they said that things about you
And when they told me I should leave you on the run
And they said just walk right out there's nothing to it
But it's the hardest easy thing I've ever done
It seems some people have no feelings at all
For them to break a heart is some sort of fun
Well I'm afraid that's not my way of thinking at all
'Cause it's the hardest easy thing I've ever done
Ever since I left blue tears have fallen
My friends say just forget her dry your eyes
And it sounds quite simple when I hear them say it
But it's the hardest easy thing I've ever tried
It seems some people have no feelings at all
Yes it's the hardest easy thing I've ever doneIt all started back in 1981.
Our life together had just begun.
I didn't know what my future would hold,
But you gave me a chance,
So I set out on the road.
It wasn't easy going then.
There were times I almost threw that old towel in,
But you kept callin' me back to the stage,
And I finally found my place in each and every face.
I'm not sayin' I'm through by any means.
There's still things that I want to say and do.
I hope you won't forget me, 'cause we've shared a lot dreams.
And just know that I'll always remember you.
When I first set out on the road, I figured
I had maybe five good years to sing my songs for you folks.
Well, it's goin' on thirty now
And I still love it just as much as I ever did.
When I hear that announcer say my name,
And I walk through those curtains
And see your smilin' faces,
My feet don't touch the ground again
Til I walk out and get back on that bus that got me here.
I don't know how many more years I've got left to do this,
But I figure a few.
I do want you to know, though,
That when I do walk off this stage for the last time,
And I'm all settled in, away from all this,
You won't be far away.
I'll still hear your screams and cheers in my mind.
And I'll always remember you.
I'm not sayin' I'm through by any means.
'Cause there's still things that I want to say and do.
I hope you won't forget me, 'cause we've shared a lot dreams.
And just know that I'll always remember you.
You've pulled me through some hard times.
Hope I've pulled you through a few.
And just know that I'll always remember you.I keep having these disturbing dreams
My final days, the end of me
For some odd reason, I get one last wish
And every time, I wish for this
Take me fast or take me slow
I don't really care how I go
In the daylight or in the dark
Just don't let me die of a broken heart
The kind of pain that you just can't take
Will send a strong man to his grave
There's not a pill that can give you a rest
Or fill that hole deep in your chest
So, take me fast or take me slow
I don't really care how I go
In the daylight or in the dark
Just don't let me die of a broken heart
No
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
I've been crushed by that hurt before
There's no way I could take any more
If I fell in love, and I found out it would happen again
I'd say take me now
And take me fast or take me slow
I don't really care how I go
In the daylight or in the dark
Just don't let me die of a broken heart
Take me fast or take me slow
I don't really care how I go
In the daylight or in the dark
Just don't let me die of a broken heart
No, don't let me die of a broken heart
NoWell I'd like to send an orchid at the start of every day
For flowers show more beauty than words could ever say
You done so much for my world till all I wanna do
Is try my best in every way to make love sweeter for you
A thousand special compliments I pay to you each day
Your years would never tire of all the sweet things I would say
Oh you never would be lonely honey you never would blue
Cause my one ache in life would be to make love sweeter for you
You given me the faith that took to make my dreams come true
That's why want to live and breathe my every breath for you
You've cleared the windows of my life and now that I see through
I'll do my best in every way to make love sweeter for you
Oh I'll do my best in every way to make love sweeter for youDarling you often said you loved me
But you've gone on before
You don't know dear how I miss you
But we can't be darlings anymore
Darling I am sad and lonely
Since you've gone on before
So down here on this lonely earth dear
We can't be darlings anymore
Until we meet up there in heaven
And we can walk the golden shore
For down here on this lonely earth dear
We can't be darlings anymore
I have lost a million tears dear
Since you've left this world and gone
But we can never again be darlings
Till we meet around the throneI let my mind wander
And what did it do
I just kept right on goin'
Until it got right to you
Can't trust it one minute
It's worst than a child
This old face without conscience
And it's driving me wild
When I let my mind wander
I try to keep my mind busy
With thoughts of today but
In terrible memories
Seem to lure it away
My lonely heart wonders
If there'll ever come a day
When I can be happy
But I can't see no way
Cause I let my mind wander[Chorus]
I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.
City folks got worries,
A country boy's got none
All I wanna be is the daddy of a farmer's son
Subdivisions are silly, I wanna be a hillbilly.
[Chorus]
I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.
When I get finished plowin'
I'm gonna go to the pond
And take my sweet baby
And have some good clean fun
You gotta work, that's a pity
I'm gonna be a hillbilly.
[Chorus]
I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.
When I die, throw me a big fine wake
And have a party in the barn
Let me lie in state
Plant me under that oak tree
I wanna be a hillbilly
[Chorus]
I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.
Subdivisions are silly
I wanna be a hillbillyJe peux gravir pour toi les sommets de l'ivresse
Et ramper en silence dans les tranchÃ©es de boue
Aussi longtemps que Mona Lisa peut garder son sourire de caresse
Je peux prendre les armes et les rendre au centuple
SÃ©cher les larmes et saluer l'horizon
Et je veux te saisir sans jamais Ã©pingler le papillon
Je t'aime, mais je ne te tiens pas
Dans le creux de ma main
Dans le creux de ma main
Dans les hivers de glace et les Ã©tÃ©s de feu
Dans les jours de pÃ©ril et les longues nuit de grÃ¢ce
A la gloire de l'Ã©treinte et au cul de la pensÃ©e Ã©troite et restreinte
Il n'a y pas de mÃ©thode et rien Ã  expliquer
Pas de techniques en vogue de calculs Ã©triquÃ©s
Que vienne l'extase et que crÃ¨vent les pouvoirs au rabais
Je t'aime, mais tu ne me tiens pas
Dans le creux de ta main
Dans le creux de ta main
Dans le creux de ta main
Faire ? des alliÃ©s
Mon amour damnÃ©
Reste encore
Une lueur dans la nuÃ©e
On les connait les porcs, les cafards et dÃ©lateurs
ApÃ´tres cyniques et rampants serviteurs
Ceux qui devant donc, qui ont le sarcasme qui gicle Ã©pars encore
Que plus jamais personne ne nous oblige Ã  vivre
En mettant dos Ã  dos spirituels et sensuels
Et que la porte d'or s'ouvre enfin sur un ciel d'infini
Je t'aime, mais tu ne me tiens pas
Dans le creux de ta main
Dans le creux de ta main
Dans le creux de ta mainHad the time of my life
Before I could see
What was really going on
And what you really thought of me
Look at me now, eyes open wide
Wiser today and driving away with my shattered pride
Now I'm nobody's fool
It ain't no fun anymore
'Cause now that I'm nobody's fool
I'd rather be yours
Well you know what they say
The truth sets you free
And that's just great unless you don't wanna be
And you can keep the last laugh
'Cause I don't like how it feels
When you save face, but your heart breaks
Well you've cut the wrong deal
Now I'm nobody's fool
I miss the way it was before
Don't wanna be nobody's fool
I wanna be your, your, yours
'Cause I'm a fool anyway
Whether I leave or stay
So why, why did I have to run?
I wanna make you laugh
I wanna make you smile
I wanna feel like I belong to someone
Now I'm nobody's fool
It ain't no fun anymore
Don't wanna be nobody's fool
I wanna be yours, yours
Don't wanna be nobody's fool
I wanna be yoursSome Doubt MY Existence

[REPEAT CHORUS]Two little girls had beautiful curls
Each had a two-wheeled bike,
Daily they rode out on the road
Crazy as you like.
One of the pair then flew through the air
Fell on her little head,
Wiping her eye she started to cry
When her young sister said...
Don't you think I just love you crying,
There's no room on my bike for two.
Stay down there Jill, and keep on crying
There's no way I can share with you.
When we grow up we'll both be nurses
And our hair will have lost their curls,
And I wonder if we'll remember
When we were two little girls.
Years passed by, each heaved a sigh,
Neither could find employ.
Both bought a car, went to a bar
Trying to find a boy.
One winter's night, one girl had a fright
Crashed in a ditch in snow.
Started to cry and thought she would die,
Then heard a voice she'd know...
Don't you think I just love you crying
I recall what you said before.
You're all right Jean, not really dying,
You can now get up off the floor.
I shall call out the rescue service
And we'll soon find out what unfurls.
But I hope now that you remember
When we were two little girls.
Don't you think I just love you crying
I recall what you said before.
You're all right Jean, not really dying,
You can now get up off the floor.
I shall call out the rescue service
And we'll soon find out what unfurls.
But I hope now that you remember
When we were two little girls.Standing on the road walking down the highway
Ain't going nowhere but that's my way of life
Well I ain't never had much ambition but I always made my own way
By turnin' a couple of jobs in some ladies' backyard I averaged about a dollar a day
I wake up early each morning and before I started on my way
I get some cigarettes and a couple of cups of coffee a sweepin' the local city cafe
Standing on the road...
Ain't never had no one to love me never had girl to call my own
I never would take a chance to fool with romance I guess I'm used to being alone
Nobody wants a drifter so I'll keep moving on
There's nothin' to tie me down when I wanna leave town
Nobody's gonna miss me when I'm goneAnother summer day
Has come and gone away
In Paris and Rome
But I wanna go home
Maybe surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel all alone
I wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
I'm fine baby, how are you?
I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that
Another airplane
Another sunny place
I'm lucky I know
But I wanna go home
I've got to go home
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I wanna come home
And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not
Come along with me
This was not your dream
But you always believed in me
Another winter day has come and gone away
In even Paris and Rome
And I wanna go home
Let me go home
And I'm surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel alone
And I wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know
Let me go home
I've had my run
Baby, I'm done
I'm coming back home
Let me go home
It will all be all right
I'll be home tonight
I'm coming back homeI tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch ,trying to come to life
I jump in the shower and the blood starts pumping
Out on the streets the traffic starts jumping
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5
[Chorus]
Workin 9 to 5,what a way to make a livin
Barley gettin by, it's all takin and no givin
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
they let you dream just to watch'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you've got dreams he'll never take away
You're in the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waiting for the day your ship'll come in
The tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll you away
[Chorus](Rodney Crowell)
Soul mate
I see you down there
Waiting for morning
To softly be coming
I find
I'm only in deeper
And you'd be a leaver
If you weren't so scared
Your true love
Has made you feel better
But look out for later
When she makes you feel worse
Times change
In daydreams and flashes
A taste of the past is
All I have seen
But you're supposed to be feeling good now
Cause everybody said you would
Honey, does it blow your mind
That the prophets would lie
You're supposed to be in your prime now
Not supposed to be wasting your time
Feeling like you're down and out
Over someone like meI slipped out of the house about sundown while mama was a washin' her hair
And you can bet your bottom dollar she'll come lookin' for me
When she'll find that I'm not there
And if she catches her sweet thang slipping around
I know there'll be the debit to pay
Cause she'll come blowin' like a cyclone right through that door
And I hear exactly what she'll say
Well has anybody here see sweet thang I got a notion he'd be headed this way
Cause when my sweet thang's out tomocattin' around
Finds a sandbox like this to play
I want to warn all you barroom roses if my sweet thang should have a bite
You'd better take my advice if you'll blink more than twice
You'd better have somethin' in your eyes
I gave my baby all my money on payday except a little she don't know that I got
Cause there's a little cute waitress down at the corner cafe
And she seems to like me quite a lot
We were sittin' in the back booth just a havin' a chair
And she believed in every word that I said
When that door blew open and mama walked in yellin' loud enough to wake the dead
And she said
Well has anybody here see sweet thang...AN HOUR AND A SIX-PACK

RECORDED BY CAL SMITH
I just got home and found a note that you left lying on my pillow case
You say you're leaving me you found another man to take my place
And then you wish me luck and say you hope that I'll get over you somehow
Honey I won't even know your name an hour and a six-pack from now
You're an hour and a six-pack away from not existing anymore
An hour and a six-pack and I won't care how much I cared before
Watch the clock pop-the-tops swallow all the pain and then the pride
And with all that we had going baby don't it hurt you knowing
My love is just an hour and a six-pack wide
I never was the kind of man who liked to stand and rummage through the ashes
When it's gone then it's gone take it out and leave it where the trash is
If you think I'll be missing you this time tomorrow baby drop around
I'm an hour and a six-pack away from being over you right now
You're an hour and a six-pack away from not existing anymore
An hour and a six-pack and I won't care how much I cared before
Watch the clock pop-the-tops smile and settle back and go to sleep
And with all that we had going don't it hurt you baby knowing
My love is just an hour and a six-pack deepAll the boys he played cards with
Couldn't wait til he came
But they haven't seen him
Since I got his last name
He plays at home now
And he always wins
Those swingin' doors
Don't do nothin' for him
[Chorus]
Cause he don't do bars anymore
That ol' jukebox
Don't turn him on like before
We dance to our radio
On our own hardwood floor
No he don't do bars anymore
He used to sit on a bar stool
Keepin' sad company
Now he lays on the couch
And he watches TV
When he's wrapped up in my arms
He knows what he's found
So don't bother askin'
For him to come 'round
[Chorus](Dolly Parton)
I try hard to forget you and the love I once shared with you
But my mind won't let forgetfulness come in
There's no use in pretending. The hurt is just beginning
Just when I think it's ending you're on my mind again
On my mind again, just like you've always been
On my mind with memories I'm rememberin'
On my mind again, just like you've always been
Yes, I find I've got you on my mind again
Sometimes I go to places where certain things erases
All traces of your memory, now and then
Oh, then something will remind me of the love I left behind me
Then again, your memory finds me and you're on my mind again
On my mind again, just like you've always been
On my mind with memories I'm rememberin'
On my mind again, just like you've always been
Yes, I find I've got you on my mind again
Yes, I find I've got you on my mind again
On my mind againDoes it show as I watch her walking by?
Does it show that I'm trying not to cry?
Does it show that he's the reason why?
Does it show that every smile is a lie?
Does it show even when I am discreet?
Does it show I fall right down at her feet?
All on its own, my heart lets me know I'm love's biggest clown
Do you think that shows even when no one is around?
Please, tell me honestly
Am I fooling anyone
Or is the truth kinda hard not to see?
In ways that I'll never know, does it show?
Please, say it's not too late
So I can stop while there's still time
An' avoid me some small bit of ache
Does it show with each flickering memories final glow?
As night's cold shadows wrap around where hope let go
An' I sit there in the dark, does it show?(Porter Wagoner)
Darling you know, you know I love you like I love no other
And you told me, remember when you told me, you'd forget her in time
Time passes by but still you can't forget her, it looks like you can't forget her
Oh and that makes me wonder if you'll ever, ever be mine
There's no way, no way I'm gonna get inside of your heart, inside your heart
While there's another, another still on your mind
There's no way, no way I'm gonna get inside of your heart, inside your heart
Not when there's another, another still on your mind
There's just no way, no way I'm gonna get inside of your heart, inside your heart
Not while there's another, another still on your mind, still on your mindDooley was a good ole man
He lived below the mill
Dooley had two daughters
And a forty-gallon still
One gal watched the boiler
The other watched the spout
And mama corked the bottles
And ole Dooley fetched 'em out.
Dooley slippin' up the holler
Dooley try to make a dollar
Dooley give me a swaller
And I'll pay you back someday.
The revenuers came for him
A-sippin' though the woods
Dooley kept behind them all
And never lost his goods
Dooley was a trader
When into town he'd come
Sugar by the bushel
And molasses by the ton.
Dooley slippin' up the holler
Dooley try to make a dollar
Dooley gimme a swaller
And I'l pay you back someday.
I remember very well
The day ole Dooley died
The women folk weren't sorry
And the men stood round and cried
Now Dooleys on the mountain
He lies there all alone
They put a jug beside him
And a barrel for his stone.
Dooley slippin' up the holler
Dooley try to make a dollar
Dooley gimme a swaller
And I'll pay you back someday.I left Ireland and crossed the Atlantic
At home once more there was no work to find.
With a heavy heart I had to make that journey
With thoughts of friends and loved ones on my mind.
I landed in New York then traveled southwards
'Cause city life was never meant for me.
I think it must've been God's plan to lead me
To a little town called Erin Tennessee
There I felt I was back in my homeland
Far across the sea
Oh I found a little bit of Ireland
Way down in Tennessee
Now very soon I met a pretty lady
She set my heart a whirlin' all could see
I wanted her to be my one and only
My southern belle from Erin Tennessee
As we walked the hills I told her of my homeland
Far across the sea
I found love in that little bit of Ireland
Called Erin Tennessee
We settled on green rollin pastures
It was there that she took my hand
And we lived and we loved and we raised our children
Far away from my own native land
Now I often tell them of my homeland
Far across the sea
But we have a little bit of Ireland
Here in Erin, Tennessee
Yes we have a little bit of Ireland
Here in Erin TenneseeeJust to hurt me just to see me sit and cry
Just to know that you brought teardrops to my eyes
Just to hurt me that's all you ever do
And just because you know I love you oh so true
Guess you know that I settle down to be a fool
Just to hurt me that's all you ever do
My life has no meaning when you're not here
And though you don't need me I know that you're near
Oh makes no difference I just hang around and try
Though you say things that break my heart inside
Just to hurt me mhm that's all you ever do
Yes just to hurt me that's all you ever doI've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just meet
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, bl da da da da da
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, la da da da da da
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
Other girls were never quite
Like this, la da da da da da
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just meet
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, la da da da da da

And she keeps calling
Me back again
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling

Oh, falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back, la da da da da daMet a little senorita named Margarita down in Mexico
She taught me more about love in a day or two than I'll ever know
I had to go back across the Rio Grande
And leave that little girl behind
I can't believe how heavy she's laying on my mind
Oh tonight I need a Margarita and I need it bad
I'm hoping that the tequila is gonna take me back
Give me the salt and the lime
So I can taste her and hold her one last time
Oh tonight I need a Margarita and I need her bad
Those eyes and that smile they drove me while, I just couldn't resist
I couldn't get enough from our first touch to our last kiss
I never understood a single word she said
Oh but she left no doubt
When she spoke to me in the language of love
She turned my world inside out
Oh tonight I need a Margarita and I need it bad
I'm hoping that the tequila is gonna take me back
Give me the salt and the lime
So I can taste her and hold her one last time
Oh tonight I need a Margarita and I need her badPapa won't you let me go to town with you
Papa I'm feeling so down and blue
You just gotta come around, please do
Papa won't you let me go to town with you
There's a blue dress at Dindy's I'd give the world to see again

Buy us some chocolate and I'll make you a pretty pie
If ya don't let me go I'll just die
Papa won't you let me go to town with you
Papa I'm feeling so down and blue
You just gotta come around, please do
Papa won't you let me go to town with you
I Gotta pick up a pattern, Aunt Nora's making me a dress

Papa won't you let me go to town with you
Papa I'm feeling so down and blue
You just gotta come around, please do
Papa won't you let me go to town with youHe climbs up on his John Deere
Shoves a plug of redman in his jaw
His eyes stretch cross the valley
Way down to where they're puttin' up a mall
His baseball cap says Kansas
The Washington says how much he can grow
There's a bank note in his pocket
That says in thirty days they'll have his home
It's hard living in a broken heartland
It's enough to break a man and his beliefs
Lord, give him strength to mend this broken heartland
'Cause he's living proof of a dying breed
His sons gone off to college
Learning skills that'll get him off the farm
And his wife just keeps it all inside
Still he finds his only comfort in her arms
And this tractors been his treasure
Oh how could an auction measure its true worth
And every night he asks the father
That he may never lose this mother earth
It's hard living in a broken heartland
It's enough to break a man and his beliefs
Lord, give him strength to mend this broken heartland
'Cause he's living proof of a dying breed
Lord, give him strength to mend this broken heartland
'Cause he's living proof of a dying breedMy Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
There's nothing I can think or do or say
To make this crazy dreaming go away
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
I wake up in the morning I go to sleep at night
Somewhere in between the two I swear Ill get it right
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
I'm wondering just how far my mind can stray
Just how wild is too high a price to pay
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
But are they wild enough to make you stay?
Or does dreaming only make you stay away?
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
My daydreams and my nightmares are so real there's no mistake
It wouldn't so bad if I was not so wide awake
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day
There's nothing I can think or do or say
I only hope and pray Ill dream someday
Just one dream wild enough to make you Stay
My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every DayWalls of Jericho
Adrieenne Young
Lookin? much older
With dust on your shoulder
Well you crashed in this mornin?
Wearin? only your pride
Highways and freight trains
Drivers with no names
Well you played such a god game it was easy to ride
With a Poor Man?s scheme and
Rich Man?s dream
You ran for your life
Over El Rio into Laredo it was do or die
The stars hung bright on the other side
Well I offered a cold beer
And I said you could stay here
I swallowed my own fear
'cause I knew what was right
We spoke in a language that was
Here before Cambridge
Colored bright terracotta and aquamarine
With a Poor Boy?s Dream and a
Rich man?s scheme
You sacrificed the warmth of your wife?s hand
Your children and homeland for a roll lof dice
A bitter slice of American Pie
Mighty walls of Jericho
Toppled by the sound of tiny feet
Trumpets sound and we will know
Just who?s sitting in the driver?s seat
Oh these walls are comin? down
Getting back to the ground
And there?ll be victory
In the sound of their defeat
Well you slept when the dawn came
So I undid the latch chain I walked
Down to the riverbank and thought about life
Just when did this happen
Was it always the fashion
Playin? just to win disregarding the price
Such a Rich Man?s scheme using
Poor Boy?s dreams
To fight the fight
How far will we go pretending we don?t know what is wrong or right
The stars hang bright on the other side
Mighty walls of Jericho
Toppled by the sound of tiny feet
Trumpets sound and we will know
Just who?s sitting in the driver?s seat
Oh these walls are comin? down
Getting back to the ground
And there?ll be victory
In the sound of their defeatI've been a moonshiner for seventeen long years
I spent all my money on whiskey and beers
I go to some hollow and put up my stilt
I'll make you one gallon for two dollar bill
I go to some grocery and drink with my friends
No women to follow to see what I spent
God bless those women I wish they were mine
Their breath smells as sweet as the dew on the vine
I'll eat when I'm hungry and drink when I'm dry
If moonshine don't kill me I'll live till I die
God bless those moonshiners, I wish they were mine
Their breath smells as sweet as the good ol' moonshine
I might go to heaven, I might go to hell
Till I meet my maker don't know where I'll [Incomprehensible]
It feels like stirred whiskey, I'll live in the sky
High upon the mountain with some sweet moonshineI had sunk as low as a man could go
The world had turned me down
Then you picked me up and you kissed me sweet
You changed a beggar into a king.
Yes, you took the rags from off of my back
And you gave me your love to keep me warm
Yes, you picked me up and you kissed me sweet
And changed a beggar into a king.
I had walked the streets with my head bowed low
The sun for me would never shine
Then you came along into my life
And changed a beggar into a king.
Yes, you took the rags from off of my back
And you placed a crown on my head
Yes, you picked me up and kissed me sweet
You changed a beggar into a king.She cries just a little when she sees him walk away
After all, she can't see it any other way
And it's hard when you're feelin' like there's nothin' left to lose
No she can't help it, she sees no excuse
There's no good in her goodbye
There's no tears she hasn't cried
But it's not enough
She needs nothin' less than love
Don't say the sacrifice is small
And no one ever has it all
When all she wants
Is nothin' less than love
You can't stand in the middle and see it either way
That's just how it is, no one ever wants the blame
So she'll pick up the pieces and pretend she just can't see
Cause all she's looking for is some room to breathe
She knows better than to wait
Just keep waiting until it's too late
There's no good in her goodbye
When all she wants
Is nothin' less than love
Don't say the sacrifice is small
And no one ever has it all
When all she wants
Is nothin' less than loveHey baby there's two sides to every story
I've heard them one too many times
Just stop callin' I'm not falling anymore
I've had enough of all your charms
Once and for all that's enough for a life time
Love's lost at long last it's over
Close the door and walk away
On the leavin' side
You can cry and cry and I won't listen
I can't hear you anymore
You can lie your lies and I won't miss 'em
Hey just walk out that door
Once and for all that's enough for a life time
Love's lost at long last it's over
Close the door and walk away
On the leavin' side
Hey baby love may come and love may go
But now it's gone for good
Just stop tryin' I'm not buyin' anymore
I've taken all I could
Once and for all that's enough for a life time
Love's lost at long last it's over
Close the door and walk away
On the leavin' side
Oh it's over close the door
And walk away on the leavin' side
Na na na na...(Dolly Parton)
Down on Music Row
Down on music Row
If you want to be a star
That's where you've got to go
I could feel a change a comin'
I left my hometown a hummin'
With my ol' guitar a strummin'
Songs that I had wrote
I was on my way to Nashville
I just couldn't hardly wait
'Till I could sing my songs
To the folks on Music Row
I got into Nashville early
Sleepy, hungry, tired and dirty
And on the steps of RCA
I ate a stale, sweet roll
In the fountain at the hall of fame
I washed my face and read the names
In the walkway of the stars
Down on Music Row
Down on Music Row
Down on music Row
If you want to be a star
That's where you've got to go
I waited there 'till eight o'clock
When office doors became unlocked
Then I started walkin'
Down the streets of Music Row
Just a walkin' up and down the street
Tryin' to find out who to see
To help me get on record
And to hear the songs I'd wrote
But I found it goin' rough
Everyone was all tied up
Either in a conference
Or in the studio
They said that I could leave a tape
But they'd suggest I didn't wait
'Cause everyone was awful busy
Down on Music Row
But I could feel that change a comin'
And I just kept right on a hummin'
With my ol' guitar still strummin'
All them songs that I'd wrote
And then Chet and Bob at RCA
Well, they listened to my songs that day
And they both told me that I was on my way
Down on Music Row
Down on Music Row
Down on music Row
If you want to be a star
That's where you've got to goWell it's 40 below and I don't give a fuck

Sometimes love is all that matters
Sometimes not worth goin' after
You never know until you go
And just about the time that you think
You've got it
It slips right through that hole in your
Pocket and goes away
What can I say
'cause I've been one time two times three
Times in love and
It ain't easy
Love ain't easy when it's wrong
Love ain't easy when it's strong
You don't remember how good it was
'til it's gone
Love ain't easy I ain't lyin'
Love ain't easy but I keep tryin'
I've been one time two times three times
In love and
Love ain't easy
You don't think twice for the chance to make it
If any love comes along you take it
You may get burned, you never learn
I've been one time two times three times
In love
And love ain't easy
Love ain't easy when it's wrong
Love ain't easy when it's strong
You don't remember how good it was
'til it's gone - long gone
Love ain't easy I ain't lyin'
Love ain't easy but I keep tryin'
I've been one time two times three times
In love and love
Ain't easyThere's a campfire burning on the Mississippi River bank
My old pickup speakers are cranking out alot of Hank
That's the sheriff's daughter dancin' on my hood
With an empty bottle this can't be good
There's an unwritten law in this sleepy little town
There ain't no drinkin' on the river when the sun goes down
Think I see the blue lights comin' through the woods
Its the sheriff and his posse, this can't be good
Everybody is runnin' like the end of the world is comin'
With a Buffard T kinda law man closin' in
She just keeps on rockin' guess I better do some talkin
She's too dumb to run n' I'm too drunk to swim
This can't be good, this can't be good, this can't be good
Aww stay tuned...
This ol' haybarn's full of last years grass
I got a whole tin can full of campfire gas
Theres a little bitty flame on this piece of firewood
And when it all comes together it can't be good
Everybody is runnin' like the end of the world was comin'
With a wildfire burnin' like a freight train outta control
She just keeps on rockin', babe there ain't no time for talking
Throw her over my shoulder run with everything I can
Hold on babe looks like were jumpin' in...
Now you know, when we get to the other side, were gonna have to take all
These wet clothes off, and hang out awhile... you know, this could be good
Yeah!A little song
A little dance
A little seltzer down yer pants
Lump o gold the size of yer head
A little bramble in yer bed
Happy day in a boat
Trade a heffer for a goat
Caledonia where the hell you been
Dear friend rub my back
'tis no cadence that I lack
Rise in humor and or laughter
May a basoon full of camphor
Blow yer britches down today
Blow yer britches down today
Caledonia where the hell you been
Step lively with caprice
Through the heavy chested spread
May the purple painted theif
Dance on the harpsichord instead
Let mine eye state it bluntly
No such stuff was in my thoughts
Caledonia where the hell you beenScreamn' whitewall tires and a guitar by his side
Billy's got the fever as he rolls on through the night
Some were born to listen, some were born to play
He was lightning on the high strings and thunder on the bass
[Chorus]
He could play it high, he could play it low
He could make it cry, he could make it moan
He knows when push comes to shove
The proof's in the pickin'
In a smoky little tavern just off of Bourbon Street
Tobacco stained fingers waited on the down beat
Conley was the master, the undisputed king
He'd ruled the town for thirty years
With an army of six strings
[Chorus]
Sometimes after midnight Billy drives through New Orleans
Straight to the French Quarter there's a man he has to see
The music is a raging like a city that's on fire
Billy felt just like an altar boy at the feet of a higher power
Conley watched as Billy walked across the room
Opened his case and started a tune
The whole club was silent and the lights were turned down low
Billy stepped up on the stage and Conley whispered "Go son, go"
[Chorus]
Conley held his hand up, no one made a sound
And he handed Bill his old arch-top and stepped into the crowd
Billy played it soft, Billy played it sad
Then he made it talk and in came the band
Soon the room was shaking before Billy's wall of sound
And just a block off Bourbon Street, a new king's been crowned.
[Chorus]It started at an early age, I guess around 13,
I'd hear those engines on the street and my how they would scream.
They'd pull into the driveway and I would run and hide,
I'd overhear my brothers friends, they'd talk about their rides.
Now momma always told me, "Don't hang around those boys;
They'll get you into trouble with the cars that make the noise,"
But I had this deep desire, that momma never knew.
Girls like fast cars too.
Girls like fast cars, fast cars too.
But they like them sweet small and petite with an engine that'll cruise.
They don't want to sound like thunder, they want their engines smooth.
Girls like fast cars too.
Drivin' down the street one night, just the girls and me.
We've cruised this town so many times it's the hottest place to be.
A car pulls up beside us as the redlight turns to green.
He's revin' up his engine lord it sounds like a mean machine.
But I took him by surprise with my good old Chevrolet,
And when the race was over he didn't have too much to say.
But by the look that he was wearing, he'd changed his attitude.
Girls like fast cars too.
Girls like fast cars, fast cars too.
But they like them sweet small and petite with an engine that'll cruise.
They don't want to sound like thunder, they want their engines smooth.
Girls like fast cars too.This old bar stools feeling higher
As a started sinking lower
The minute that she waltzed right through that door
Not long ago I held her
Like a fool I went and left her
Now she's with somebody else out on that floor
And she's got the rhythm and I got the blues
And she's showing me how much I had to lose
With her every little move she's telling me I'm over you
She's got the rhythm and I got the blues
Well that music's gettin' louder
As my heart keeps beatin' faster
As she spells out regret in perfect time
Well I thought I wanted freedom
But that ball and chain I needed
'Cause when you choose, sometimes you lose the prize
And she's got the rhythm and I got the blues
And she's showing me how much I had to lose
With her every little move she's telling me I'm over you
She's got the rhythm and I got the blues
With her every little move she's telling me I'm over you
She's got the rhythm and I got the bluesAs we passed in the hall
She said we need to talk
I can't go on like this another day
I froze in my tracks
And a chill ran up my back
'Cause I knew what she was gonna say
She said there's someone else
And I've kept it to myself
But I can't keep these feelings locked inside
I need to tell you this
It's one of your old friends
One you haven't talked to in a while
She said I'm leaving
And there's nothing you can do
I said I had a feeling you found somebody new
And I'll bet I can guess his name
But it's so hard to believe
'Cause she said you're not even close
It's someone you don't know
I'm leaving you for me
I just stood there at a loss for words
Tryin' to catch my breath
'Cause I knew that it was over when
She said I'm leaving
And there's nothing you can do
I said I had a feeling that you found somebody new
And I'll bet I can guess his name
But it's so hard to believe
Oh she said you're not even close
It's someone you don't know
I'm leaving you for me
She said you're not even close
It's someone you don't know
I'm leaving you for me"Hey y'all,
Watch this!"
Daddy's belt
Mama's drapes
Standing tall on the backyard shed
Lookin' cool in my Superman cape
I told the neighborhood girls,
said "Hey y'all, watch this!"
My fate was a broken arm
My reward, one big kiss
When Daddy asked me why I did it
I made him laugh out loud
When I told him 'cause the chicks dig it
Scars heal
Glory fades
And all we're left with all the memories made
Oh yeah, pain hurts
But only for a minute
Life is short so go on and live it
'Cause the chicks dig it!
Blacktop road
Learner permit
Though I was Earnhardt
Drvin' fast
But I didn't see the ditch
Took out a mailbox
Then a fence, then a barn
The police came and called my father
But I met the farmers daughter
And when the judge asked me why I did it
He threw the book at me
When I told him 'cause the chicks dig it!
Scars heal
Glory fades
And all we're left with all the memories made
Oh yeah, pain hurts
But only for a minute
Life is short so go on and live it
'Cause the chicks dig it!
Just throw caution to the wind my friend
Then sit back and watch your life begin!
'Cause scars heal
Glory fades
And all we're left with all the memories made
Yeah, pain hurts
But only for a minute
Yeah, life is short so go on and live it
'Cause the chicks dig it!
Scars heal
Glory fades
And all we're left with all the memories made
Pain hurts
But only for a minute
Yeah life is short so go on and live it
It don't matter if you lose or if you win it,
Hey, the chicks dig it!
Oh yeah
The chicks dig it
The chicks dig it
Oh hey, oh yeah
The chicks dig it!
"I got this scar when I was three years old showin' off for the girl next door on my tricycle. And the one over my eye, well i got that back in '82 jumpin' off the train trestle bridge. But I got the girl...uh The chicks dig it."To spend one night with you in our old rendezvous,
And reminisce with you that's my desire.
To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,
And dance 'till break of day that's my desire.
We'll sip a little glass of wine, I'll gaze into your eyes divine.
I'll feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine.
To hear you whisper low just when it's time to go,
Cherie, I love you so, that's my desire.Your perfume is on the pillow
But I can't bring myself to change that pillow case
Some of your clothes are in the closet
But I can't bring myself to throw them away
And you stare at me from across the room
I remember when I took that picture
My favorite one of you
CHORUS
To tell the truth
I like lyin' to myself
It keeps you with me
There will never be anyone else
Although you're everywhere I look
I know you're really gone
To tell the truth, without you
I like lyin' to myself
All of our friends ask about you
And I tell them that we're doin' fine
In my heart, we're still together
But I'm in love's prison, doin' time
I just can't admit to losing you
So I
To stop this pain I can't go through
CHORUSTonight doesn't feel like it did last night
I'm feeling warm and different inside
Since I saw your face
Since I looked in your eyes
There's a change in this place
I think the love factor's high
[Chorus]
When the love factor's high
And too hard to collide
You don't even try
And that's when you'll find
The one that feels right
The one for all time
It's hard to deny
When the love factor's high
Sometimes it flies and sometimes it falls
Sometimes your back
Ends up against the wall
As I hold you close
We dance in time
And I think I know the love factor's high
[Chorus]See the pyramids along the Nile
Watch the sunrise on a tropic isle
Just remember, darling, all the while
You belong to me
See the marketplace in old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember 'til you're home again
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember 'til you're home again
You belong to meI take too much abuse to me that's all I ever get
Yeah callin' a man like you a husband is just like callin' old wild cat a pet
You'd better stop your runnin' around say nothin' stop movin' on
But who's gonna take your garbage out when I've packed my bags and gone
Each day you walk off over me can't you take another out
If you start actin' like married man maybe we could find the way to work things out
You'll find your key won't fit the lock if you keep on a keepin' on
But who's gonna take your garbage out when I've packed my bags and gone
I know you think I'm runnin' round and that's why you're so peaked
That's another lie of that same old stuff but I hope you don't expect me to belive
Though after night you don't come back cause you just love the home
But who's gonna take your garbage out when I've packed my bags and gone
[ steel ]
I know you think I'm runnin' round...
Honey who's gonna take your garbage out when I've packed my bags and gone
You're gonna miss me honey gal
Ah you're kiddin'I've been through hell and half of louisiana
Lookin' for a man like you
I know you could have any woman you want
And I know you've had a few
I know I've got some stiff competition
They ain't got nothin' on me
'cause I've got something that you've been missin'
I practice what I preach
Chorus:
'cause I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your friend
And I wanna be your full-time woman
Closer than your kin
I wanna be your satisfaction
Be your number one
And just when you think I can't love you any better
Well, I have just begun
'cause there's more where that came from
There's more where that came from
And I want your clothes in my closet
My name on your mail
And I want my love to be your faucet
Drinkin' from an endless well
I want your kids to call me mama
I want you to call me hun
I wanna be the one you love and honor
When it's all been said and done
Chorus:
'cause I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your friend
And I wanna be your full-time woman
Closer than your kin
I wanna be your satisfaction
Be your number one
And just when you think I can't love you any better
Well, I have just begun
'cause there's more where that came from
That's right, there's more where that came from
2nd chorus:
Oh, I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your friend
I wanna be your full-time woman
I'm gonna get under your skin
'cause I wanna be your satisfaction
Be your number one
And just when you think I can't love you any better
Well, I have just begun
There's more where that came from
That's right, there's more where that came from
Tag:
Yes, I wanna be your full-time woman
I wanna be that, I wanna be that
Oh, I wanna be your lover, lover, lover
I wanna be that, I wanna be that
And I wanna be your satisfaction
I wanna be that, I wanna be thatShe says, you know the monkey bar rules
As she kisses away his playground bruise
You don't have to skip a bar each time
To make it to the other side
She picked him up from out of the sand
And ties his shoelace that read "superman"
We all fall down
It's the getting' back up that really counts
We live and we learn
To help someone up when it's their turn
In life there's only one guarantee
Your feet won't always be on the ground
'Cause we all fall down
She says, I know what you're goin' through
As she talks to the door of her daughter's room
Your heart feels like it's been broken in two
But baby I'm here for you
The door opened and she stepped inside
She put her arms around her and said, it's okay to cry
We all fall down
It's the getting' back up that really counts
We live and we learn
To help someone up when it's their turn
In life there's only one guarantee
Your feet won't always be on the ground
'Cause we all fall down
He's forty-five and his job is gone
Cleans out his desk and heads on home
Sees his kids out playin' in the yard
Been a while since he's been hit so hard
He's as scared as a man can be
He tells his wife and she says, honey look at me
We all fall down
It's the getting' back up that really counts
We live and we learn
To help someone up when it's their turn
In life there's only one guarantee
Your feet won't always be on the ground
'Cause we all fall down
We all fall down
But you gotta get back upThis track is an instrumental and has no lyrics.There's no reason
to be spending all my money on you
when you don't even want to talk
I just don't get it
I just don't get it
I want to be around, you know?
But you're making it too hard
I get no time with you honey
You're always busy
I give all of mine to you honey
but you're always busy
I come home from work
and you haven't gotten out of bed yet
You just don't get it
You just don't get it
I want to be around, you know?
But you're making it too hard
I get no time with you honey
You're always busy
I give all of mine to you honey
but you're always busy
I want to be around, you know?
But you're making it too hard
I get no time with you honey
You're always busy
I give all of mine to you honey
but you're watching TV
I give all my time to you honey
All my time
I give all of mine to you honey
But you got no time for meHave a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
Well I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Ho ho the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly have a holly jolly Christmas
This year
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Ho ho the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly have a holly jolly Christmas
This year
Oh by golly have a holly jolly Christmas
This yearOn the wings of a snow white dove he sends his pure sweet love
A sign from above on the wings of a dove
When troubles surround us when evils come the body grows weak the spirit grows numb
When these things beset us he doesn't forget us
He sends down his love on the wings of a dove
On the wings of a snow white dove.
When Jesus went down to the river that day he was baptized in the usual way
When it was done God blessed his son he sent him his love on the wings of a dove
On the wings of a snow white dove.
Wings of a doveAnother twenty miles and I'm halfway there,
Another twenty miles and I'm running scared
It's a beautiful night and I should be there
I know you are tired of waiting
And I know you are tired of hesitating
If love gets there before I do,
Darling don't you take it.
If love gets there before I do,
Darling don' t you do it, no don't you do it
I know you're hearing line from those other guys
Trying to wear you down under starry sky
But you know that I want you to just hold on
I know you are tired of waiting
And I know you are tired of hesitating
If love gets there before I do,
Darling don't you take it.
If love gets there before I do,
Darling don' t you do it, no don't you do itIf I'm a fallen angel you can't blame me for it all
If I'm a fallen angel you're the one who made me fall
Another fallen angel that's what you call me now
Because you see me out each night breaking every vow
You took my love for granted you're lonely constantly
And that's the only way that I can hide mysery
If I'm a fallen angel...
[ guitar ]
So many times I told you I couldn't take much more
Do you remember how you laughed and walked right out the door
The only way that I can stop my tears before they start
Is go the way of other girls who have a broken heart
If I'm a fallen angel...I'm just driftwood on the river floating down the tide
I don't care where this old river carries me
I keep drifting just because my heart is broken inside
And I'm tired of wishing for what cannot be
(I may meet some little driftwood lost as same as I
Share a handshake and a tender tear or two)
But it's always good luck how we got to say goodbye
I must wander on to keep my rendezvous
Though I drift through town and city I can never stay
For I find no place to call my home sweet home
I don't ask for help or pitty I just go my way
All I'm praying for is peace to dream alone
(I'm just driftwood on the river and I'm drifting on
Till this weary river meets the deep blue sea)
Where the deep blue sea may help me to forget someone
Yes the careless one who has forgotten me
In my heart I don't feel bitter over what has been
I feel sorry for the one I must forget
And instead of being someone with the world to win
I'm just driftwood on the river of regretI can't say that it's black I can't say that it's white
Is it really wrong is it really right
We don't know where to place it I guess we'll have to face it
We walk the thin grey line of love
We shouldn't be together we have so much to lose
One of us must make the choice but please don't make me choose
I feel I've got to have you I feel the same way too
Our love should go for we both know we walk the thin grey line of love
We both tried hard to break up but we just break each vow
If you'll just say you don't love me I'd stay away somehow
But you know I can't say it and I'd die if you could
We'll break our home as if we'll go on walkin' the thin grey line of love
Yes, we walk the thin grey line of love(He's going home yes he's going back)
I'm going home to the arms of my hometown sweetheart
Cause she means the world to me
I have missed her cherry lips cherry smile missed her kiss all the while
Been as lonesome as can be
No other girl incompare to my hometown sweetheart
Hand to toe she suits me fine
I'm just a hometown boy who'll be full of joy when I'll see
That hometown sweetheart of mine
(He's going home to the arms of his hometown sweetheart)
Cause she means the world to me
(He misses her honey lips honey smile misses her kisses all the while)
Been as lonesome as can beWhen I woke up today, I was feeling ok. But my mind started turning as breakfast was burning. My soul slipped away to a red evening sky, and a lovers sweet sigh, in the wink of an eye. In the wink of an eye.
Just try not to think, cause it will drive you to drink. But I cannot forget the all the things that you said while when were high. I was flying too high, hung out to dry, in the wink of an eye.
What more can I say, why should I even try. After reading your letter, I don't know whether to laugh or to cry, or just say goodbye, just say goodbye. With a wink in my eye.
La la lalalalalalalalalalaalalalalalalaLet's go to Louisiana boys
Way down in Louisiana where the moss and cypress grew
You'd find old Jack in a shotgun shack
In the back of the black bayou
Some folks called him crazy but I knew better than that
He kept a hundred dollar bill tucked away in the brim
Of his dirty old cowboy hat
Jack told me a story when I was ten years
He said there was once a fool tried to swim this swamp
With his back weighted down with gold
He said you should've seen that alligator smile
He had a meal fit for a king
But he need up on my table son, money ain't everything
He said there's only one way into this world
And one way out it's true
You either eat the alligator
Or he's gonna eat you
There's people livin' in a high-rise
That'll never hear a robin sing
What good is first place when you're in a rat race
Money ain't everything
Little Maggie May lay dying, her heart was about to go
When her daddy found a sack on the porch out back
With a half a million dollars in gold
They still talk about the stranger who saved her life that spring
No name on the note but someone wrote, money ain't everything
He said there's only one way into this world
And one way out it's true
You either eat the alligator
Or he's gonna eat you
There's people livin' in a high-rise
That'll never hear a robin sing
What good is first place when you're in a rat race
Money ain't everything
No name on the note but I know who wrote, money ain't everythingSister's comin' home
Mama gonna let her sleep the whole day long
The whole day long
Sister's comin' home
Mama gonna let her sleep the whole day long
Sister's comin' home
Mama don't like the man that done her wrong
That done her wrong
Sister's coming home
Mama don't like the man that done her wrong
Down at the local beer joint
Dancin' to the rock' n' roll
Sister's like to do it, Lord
Sister's like to move her soul
Down at the local beer joint
Dancin' on the hardwood floor
Her jeans fit a little bit tighter
Than they did before
Than they did before
Her jeans fit a little bit tighter
Than they did before
She likes to move her soul
She likes to move her soul
Sister likes to do it, Lord
Sister likes to move her soul
Sister's comin' home
Mama don't like the man that done her wrong
That done her wrong
Sister's coming home
Mama don't like the man that done her wrong
And the mirror's gonna tell her
How long she's been gone
Sister's comin' homeSniffin that cocaine all over town
Honey don't you let my deal go down
Hey hey buddy let that cocaine be
Strutin down the field walkin on main
Tryin to find a nickel to buy cocaine
Hey hey buddy let the cocaine be
Tell it to me tell it to me
Drink corn liquor let that cocaine be
Hey hey buddy let that cocaine be
Tell it to me tell it to me drink corn liquor
And let that cocaine be
Hey hey let the cocaine be
Well i don't what I'm gonna do
Its killing my friends its gonna kill me too
Hey hey buddy let the cocaine be
Made for horse not for men
The doc said it'll kill me but he don't know when
Hey hey let that cocaine be
Chorus
Now some of you rounders think you're tough
Dipping that cocaine just like snuff
Hey hey buddy let that cocaine be
It'll burn out your face
Make your nose turn red
That damn old cocaine'll kill you dead
Hey hey buddy let that cocaine be
ChorusMama got a call from the Principal's office
"Better get down here fast
'Cause Mandy passed out when her water broke in the middle of geometry class"
Her mama didn't know she was nine months late
Been gettin' on her 'bout gainin' weight
And now she's a grandma
Somebody had a baby
Somebody had a breakdown
Oh, it's a big day
In a small town
Willy Smith swore he wouldn't miss one more
Of Junior's football games
Got his twelve-pack o' Bud and his Friday night buzz
Headin' south in the northbound lane
Junior's the endzone, halfback pitch
Willy's sittin' upside-down in a ditch
And the crowd goes wild
Somebody rent a pitch
Somebody score a touchdown
Oh, it's a big day
In a small town
There ain't no mall, no waffle house
But there's always somethin' to talk about
Around here, somebody shot a deer
Somebody's gettin' married, buried, or carried away
The sun comes up
And the sun goes down
Ah, it's a big day
In a small town
Rumour goin' 'round about a methodist man
And a jailbait checkout queen
His wife caught wind of unspeakable sin
Goin' down on Aisle Thirteen
She left all the chicken in the fryin' pan
Drew all the kids in the grand caravan
With a baseball bat
Somebody went to Wal-Mart
In nothin' but a nightgown
Oh, it's a big day
In a small town
There ain't no mall, no waffle house
But there's always somethin' to talk about
Around here, somebody shot a deer
Somebody's gettin' married, buried, or carried away
The sun comes up
And the sun goes down
Ah, it's a big day
In a small townTRUCK DRIVIN' SON OF A GUN
(Dixie Dean - Robert A. King)
Â« Â© '65 Southern Arts Music, BMI Â»
I got a cute little gal in every eastern town from Boston to St Louis
There's some that I don't even know but I'm looking forward to
Cause I like my women everywhere I go
So roll on big wheels don't you roll so slow
Peggy Ann is a waitin' in Memphis and Betty Lou in Maine
I got a good ole gal in Knoxville but man I forgot her name
But not her figure I remember that
Yeah I'm a kiss stealin' a wheelin' deelin' a truck drivin' son of a gun
Well there goes Joe flyin' low making up his time
But where I sit I don't believe you'd say I'm wastin' mine
I'm movin' faster than a Jimmy-8
If you think I'm losin' time you're runnin' late
I got a steady little baby waitin' back home for me
But there are six more towns to go till I'm back in Tennessee
And six more women at least I know
Yeah I'm a kiss stealin' wheelin' deelin' a truck drivin' son of a gunI was blue till I found you I didn't know where the road of life was leadin' me to
I'm on my own I walk alone it seems like Lonely Street would be my permanent home
But baby now I'm walkin' down Happy Street smilin' at everyone that I meet
Oh ain't it funny what fallin' in love can do
Now I'm walkin' down Happy Street I never thought life could be so sweet
Now I'm walkin' down Happy Street with you
[ strings ]
Same old place same human race
But now it seems like the world put on a happier face
Since you are mine each day I find
It's filled with sunshine and your love is makin' it shine
And baby now I'm walkin' down Happy Street smilin' at everyone that I meet
Oh ain't it funny what fallin' in love can do oh honey
Now I'm walkin' down Happy Street I never thought life could be so sweet
But anyplace is Happy Street with youPlease help me I'm falling in love with you
Close the door to temptation don't let me walk through
Turn away from me darling I'm begging you to
Please help me I'm falling in love with you
I belong to another whose arms have grown cold
But I promised forever to have and to hold
I can never be free dear but when I'm with you
I know that I'm losing the strength to be true
Please help me I'm falling and that would be sin
Close the door to temptation don't let me walk in
For I mustn't want you but darling I do
Please help me I'm falling in love with youTrack 4 "270 Somethin'"
Parody of Mark Wills' "19 Somethin'" by Mark Wills
Enjoy
Woo
You know a man does have to eat him somethin'
I love candy bars...eat them all the time
My combo meal's are super-sized
And I crave the stuff they put inside those dang ding dongs
Mmm
My cholesterol is off the chart
I keep a blood pressure cuff on my left arm
Doctor says that my poor heart won't last too long
My nickname in school was double wide
Cause my momma fried
Now I weigh 270 somethin'
Always huffin and puffin
Lay around the house all day
No wonder I can't lose no weight
See that pizza on the TV
Oh man don't it look cheesy
You know they deliver here for nothin'
That's why I weigh 270 somethin'
My insurance said that they'd co-pay
I made the same appointment Carnie Wilson made
Plastic surgeon said he had a way to get those love handles off
He stapled and sucked stuff through a tube
I lost a hundred pounds in one afternoon
When I came to in the recovery room
Wouldn't much left of me
When he removed the bandages from my thighs
I couldn't believe my eyes
Now I weigh 180 somethin'
Didn't have to do much of nothin'
I'm lookin' like Jean Claude Van Damme
To fit in a pair Mark Wills' pants
Now everyone who sees me
Can't believe that I'm so skinny
My body fat is nearly nothin'
Ha ha
Now that I weigh 180 somethin'
Ha Ha
Now I date a model with a GED
But do you think she'd be with me
I wonder (I wonder)
If I (If I)
Still weighed 270 somethin'
Stuffin down blueberry muffins
Onion rings and cans of SPAM
That's how I got so fat
Now everyone who sees me
Can't believe that I'm so skinny
I used to break a sweat just doin' nothin'
Back when I weighed 270 somethin'
Now I weigh 180 somethin'
Ah, well it's probably like more like around 225-26
None of y'all's business how much I weigh
Huh huhThey tell me that you are going away
What makes you want to leave?
You gave me your love and you gave me your vow
Now you're leavin' me here to grieve
Live and let live, don't break my heart
Don't leave me here to cry
I never could live if we should part
Tell me you don't mean goodbye
Stayed awake last night and I walked the floor
What makes you treat me so?
Live and let live, don't break my heart
I don't want to live if you go
You're the one who's made me love you so
You're the one who's makin' me cry
You're the one who'd break my heart if you go
Tell me you don't mean goodbyeChat, but the girls don't like it.
Sitting, but you won't allow it.
Chat, but the girls don't like it.
Sitting, but you won't allow...
Then she comes over with some sweet Corona,
and she comes over with some sweet Corona.
And everyday I wanna sing that tune,
because she is wilder than me, wilder than me, wilder than me,
wilder than me, wilder than me.
Chat, but the girls don't like it.
Sitting, but you won't allow it.
Chat, but the girls don't like it.
Sitting, but you won't allow...
Then she comes over with some sweet Corona,
and she comes over with some sweet Corona.
And everyday I wanna sing that tune,
because she is wilder than me, wilder than me, wilder than me,
wilder than me, wilder than me, wilder than me, wilder than me, wilder than me, wilder than me, wilder than me, wilder than me, wilder than me, wilder than me, wilder than me, wilder than me, wilder than me, wilder than me, wilder than me.Come all ye young cowboys and listen to me
And don't waste your life on that ol' hanging tree
And don't think that size ever makes man small
You find out it's nothing at all
They know a tension when the old words are said
?Don't cheat in poker and don't lose your head?
Lost cowboys are human and bullets kill dead
Six guns don't make a man tall
'Cause it's all so easy to run with the crowd
And they're a damn good bunch of cowboys
Makes a man feel proud
Do a honest day?s work for the money you spend
Be fast with the ladies and slow with the man
Be kind to your horses and true to your friends
And treat every mother's son fair
Don't stay in town late on a Saturday night
Don't let no one tease you into a fight
'Cause when they're saddled with guns
There ain't nobody right
It's a short trail that leads to nowhere
'Cause it's all so easy to run with the crowd
And they're a damn good bunch of cowboys
Makes a man feel proud
'Cause it's all so easy to run with the crowd
And they're a damn good bunch of cowboys
Makes a man feel proudI've been racing, chasing, caught up in the grind
Damn near going out of my mind
And it's getting old real fast I need a new
Time zone, zip code, point of view
I sat by the window seat and drew (don't fly with me)
A drunken run so crowded
And here we are
Strangers, barefoot dancing on the bar
The bottom of the bottle seems so far
So come on, let's dive back in
'Cause I'm tired of working, it's time to play
Where I stumble's where I've stayed
If palm tree shade makes a perfect tent
Then wasted time is time well spent
I got all I need
Floating on the breeze in [?]
The pounding in my head's starting to ease
From the magic in this glass
Yeah, that's the way it works down here
Things turn around real fast
And here we are
Strangers, barefoot dancing on the bar
The bottom of the bottle seems so far
So come on, let's dive back in
'Cause I'm tired of working, it's time to play
Where I stumble's where I've stayed
If palm tree shade makes a perfect tent
Then wasted time is time well spent
You can get a little loud
We can get a little hard to find
Give a little bit of love
We'll mix it with a bit of sunshine
Mix it up
And here we are
Strangers, barefoot dancing on the bar
The bottom of the bottle seems so far
So come on, let's dive back in
'Cause I'm tired of working, it's time to play
Where I stumble's where I've stayed
If palm tree shade makes a perfect tent
Then wasted time is time well spent
You gotta waste a little time in your life once in a while
Come on everybody
Ah, here we are
Strangers, barefoot dancing on the bar
Fill 'er up again
It's time well spent, it's time well spent
It's time well spent, it's time well spentThere's a little band reeling in my head whenever I see you smile.
I could kiss and tell if there's more to this one kiss that I could tell
We could fall all in love, baby let's fall all in love
Something like nothing that I've ever felt is moving inside of me.
I could kiss and ask if this love will last one kiss that I could tell
We could fall all in love, baby let's fall all in love
[Chorus]
I wanna live in the light of your love
Starting right here now today,
Live in the light of your love
Darling just show me the way.
I wanna live in the light of your love
Shine like the stars up above,
I wanna live in the light of your love,
Live in the light of your love.
There's not a sound in this whole wide world I couldn't whisper in my ear.
I can her your heart speak straight to mine it's beating right on time
We could fall all in love, baby let's fall all in love.
[Chorus]
I wanna live in the light of your love,
Live in the light of your love.I heard the train
In the Tulsa night
Calling out my name
Looking for a fight
She's come a long, long way
Got a longer way to go
So tell me how a train from Tulsa
Has got a right to know
She sings a song
So sad and high
And the Tulsa queen
Don't ever lie
And she don't care where she goes
Don't care where she's been
And the Tulsa queen ain't crying
'Cause I won't see you again
And I want to ride
Like a Tulsa queen
Calling out to you
As she calls to me
As far away from Tulsa
As these ten wheels can be
Lately I speak
Your name too loud
Each time it comes up
In a crowd
And I know it when I do
The Tulsa queen and you
Are gone...They call me a playboy
While I'm making my rounds
Chasing the bright lights
Of every night spot in town
Though I never show, son,
My heart's breaking in two
They may call me a playboy
But I'm just lonesome for you
I once had a real love
That was when I had you
Now, I'll never feel love
With anyone new
This false front I'm wearing
Is just to cover my blues
They may call me a playboy
But. I'm just lonesome for you
--- Instrumental ---
I once had a real love
That was when I had you

They may call me a playboy
But. I'm just lonesome for you
They may call me a playboy
But. I'm just lonesome for you.
They may call me a playboy
But. I'm just lonesome for you...Sweet dreams of you, every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life anew?
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
You don't love me, it's plain
I should know I'll never wear my ring
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
Sweet dreams of you, things I know can't come true
Why can't I forget the past, start loving someone new?
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
Instead of having sweet dreams about youRuby oh Ruby honey are you mad at your man
I was sittin' in the shade with shovel with my spade diggin' in the ground gold mine
Ruby Ruby honey are you mad at your man
I've done all I can do get along with you still you're not satisfied
Ruby Ruby honey are you mad at your man
If you don't believe I'm right then call on me tonight

Ruby Ruby honey are you mad at your manFly, fly away, fly away in the morning
Fly, fly away; just don't give me no warning
Go on, girl, fly away
If that's what you want to do
'Cause whatever's left to say, girl
It won't come from me and you
So fly, fly away, fly away in the morning
Fly, fly away; just don't give me no warning
I guess everything's been done
But if there's nothing here for you
If you want to chase the sun, girl
Well, that's just what you ought to do(Everything will be alright yeah, alright yeah)
The heart is stronger
Than you think
It's like it can go
Through anything
And even when you think
It can't it finds a way
To still push on

LeAnn:
(yodeling)
The cattle are prowlin',
The coyotes are howlin'
Way out where the doggies roam
Where spurs are a jinglin'
And the cowboy is singing
His lonesome cattle call
(yodeling)
He rides in the sun
'Til his days work is done
And he rounds up the cattle each fall
(yodeling)
Singing his cattle call
Eddy:
For hours he would ride
On the range far and wide
When the night wind blows up and slow
His heart is a feather
In all kinds of weather
He sings his cattle call
(yodeling)
He's browned as a fairy
From ridin' the prairie
And he sings with an western drawl
Singing his cattle call
LeAnn and Eddy:
(yodeling)One of Thy children is coming home open Thy merciful arms
One of Thy children's too tired to roam open Thy merciful arms
Send out a shepherd open the gate
Jesus has called and his sheep must not wait
Oh what a joy to be travelling home open Thy merciful arms
Though we may travel the valley of death
Jesus will save us from harm
Though we be weary we soon will rest open Thy merciful arms
Do not be fearful last teepee late
Jesus has called and his sheep must not wait
Oh what a joy to be travelling home open Thy merciful armsPlease don't wake me tonight while I'm sleeping
For I might have the same dream again
Let me hold the whole world for just a moment while I hold you in my arms once again
[ dobro ]
Last night I had a dream about you darlin' happy tears filled my eyes as I have you
When I awoke and realized I was dreaming
Happy tears that filled my eyes had changed to blue
Please don't wake me...
[ dobro ]
I know that's the only way that I can hold you
I realized that you belong to someone new
Let me dream and think that you are still mine dear
For you know that I have always worshipped you
Please don't wake me...Scattered Leaves
(Jeremy Lindsey)
Don't you go looking so surprised, baby don't you look so stunned
Didn't I tell you that a cold november'd come?
And deliver the leaves from green to red,
To blowing in the wind stone dead
Well I never used to notice this awful quiet, mmmmh
And fall was just the calm before the next spring riot, mmmhh
Of wildflowers and lunatic rivers -
Sweat jumping off of the skin of love givers, mmh (in the park)
Scattered leaves don't lie
Aw' now baby, baby, quit your cryin'
Like everything that ever mattered, scit-scat scattered
Like every love word you heard
But that's just the way when you walk your days
In the beauty of this world
(repeat)
Pretty little disappointments all in a row
Been about a year since you disappeared through my door
And now you come back with your head on straight,
But I got no love or hate left for you, girl
You must be the daughter of the late, late rose - I'm November's son
And I'm here to tell you, honey, ooh what's done is done
Yeah, I been claimed by the wind and the rain
There ain't no going back, naw there ain't no going back again (for us now)
Repeat chorusShe burns too hot, plays too rough
She's got a dress full of dangers stuff
The way she looks tears me apart
The way she loves me nearly stops my heart
If her lovin' don't kill me
Don't put me six feet down
I'll be the last man standing
On the top of the hill
If her lovin' don't kill me
Then nothing will
My doctor told me I looked kind of ragged
He said, what happened son, did you fall off the wagon
I said, it ain't my drinking or my smoking doc
It's just my drop dead darling rockin' me around the clock and
If her lovin' don't kill me
Don't put me six feet down
I'll be the last man standing
On the top of the hill
If her lovin' don't kill me
Then nothing will
Every night she tears me up
She gives it good and I can't get enough
If her lovin' don't kill me
Don't put me six feet down
I'll be the last man standing
On the top of the hill
If her lovin' don't kill me
Then nothing willNow some folks like the summertime when the they can walk about
Strolling through the meadow green it's pleasant there no doubt
But give me the wintertime when the snow is on the ground
For I found her when the snow on the ground
I traced her little footprints in the snow
I found her little footprints in the snow
I bless that happy day when Nellie lost her way
For I found her when the snow was on the ground
I dropped in to see her there was a big round moon
Her mother said she just stepped out but would be returning soon
I found her little footprints and I traced them in the snow
I found her when the snow was on the ground
Now she's up in heaven she's with the angel band
I know I'm going to meet her in that promised land
But every time the snow falls it brings back memories
For I found her when the snow was on the groundIt ain't complicated
Well, I've grown to hate it
I never liked the taste of crow but baby I ate it
They tried to warn me
They said that you were ornery
So don't bring me those big brown eyes and tell me that you're sorry
Well you might as well throw gasoline on a fire
The way you lie
You lie like a priceless Persian rug on a rich man's floor
And you lie like a cooped up dog basking in the sunshine on my porch
Well you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie
That ain't my perfume
I bet she had a curfew
You told me you were out with the boys and baby I believed you
So why you lookin' so nervous
You know you're gonna deserve this
I oughta kill you right now and do the whole wide world a service
Well my daddy's gonna straighten you out like a piece of wire, like a piece of wire
The way you lie
You lie like the man with the slick black hair who sold me that Ford
And you lie like a pine tree in the back yard after last month's storm
Well you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie
Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna drive until the big ol' muddy river
I'm gonna park my car in the middle of the mile-long bridge
And then I'm gonna cry well maybe just a little
Then I'm gonna slip off the ring that you put on my finger
And give it a big ol' fling and watch it sink
Down, down, down
There it's gonna lie
Until the Lord comes back around
Because you lie like a priceless Persian rug on a rich man's floor
You lie like a coondog basking in the sunshine on my porch
Well you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes so dang natural to you
The way you lie
The way you lie
Well it's what you do, it's who you areHome Remedy
Its a home remedy when you put your arms around me
I know the working day is through
Youre the right recipe never failing to astound me
Time proven tried and true
Passion flowers, love in bloom
Solar power lighting up the room
Youre a soulful feeling, and my natural high
A touch of healing in the night, feels so right
You brought your laughter, I gave my trust
You showed me patience and a healthy dose of lust
Cant advertise it, cant box it up
But I have tried it and Ill never get enough of the
Things we say without a sound
The way you turn my world aroundI like to play Hank Williams Jr. records just as loud as they will go
I'm into Lynyrd Skynyrd
The Allman Brothers and David Allan Coe
I like Willie, Waylon, George, and Merle
And a lot of ZZ Top
They play country, soul, rock and roll
I really like Kid Rock
Chorus
And I'm a redneck
A rock-n-roll son of the south
I don't like no new wave disco bands around
I'm gonna drink a couple dozen beers
Go out and jam some gears
I'm a long haired redneck rock-n-roll son of the south
I've got a 1965 Harley chopper
It sure makes those women stare
A dead flamingo wrapped around the cowboy hats I wear
I can cuss I can fight I can spit I can belch I can raise all kinds of hell
If you ride to live like I live to ride let me hear some rebel yells
Chorus
And I'm a redneck
A rock-n-roll son of the south
I don't like no new wave disco bands around
I'm gonna drink a couple dozen beers
Go out and jam some gears
I'm a long haired redneck rock-n-roll son of the south
I like my whiskey straight up
Daqueri just makes me ill
If someone touches my cowboy hat I get mad enough to kill
I got a rifle rack in my pickup truck
I'm a four wheelin' maniac
And if you want to race name the place
I'll show you where it's at mother fucker
Chorus
And I'm a redneck
A rock-n-roll son of the south
I don't like no new wave disco bands around
I'm gonna drink a couple dozen beers
Go out and jam some gears
I'm a long haired redneck rock-n-roll son of the south
I'm a long haired redneck rock-n-roll son of the south
I'm a long haired redneck rock-n-roll son of the southHalf of my mistakes I made stone cold sober
Half of my mistakes I've made at closing time
Half the time I never saw it coming, until it was over
Oh, and half of my mistakes I've made with love the line
Half of my mistakes I swear, I should've known better
Half of my mistakes were just amongst friends
You get a little distance on it, the truth is clearer
On, and half of my mistakes I'd probably make 'em again
Chorus:
If I it all to do over
I'm sure I'd win and lost just as much
but spend alot less time on right and wrong
and a lot more time on love
Half of my mistakes I've made 'cause I was moving to quickly
Half of them where made 'cause my heart was moving too slow
Nobody can tell you a damn thing, if you ain't listening
Oh, And half of my mistakes I've made 'cause I couldn't let go
Chorus:
If I it all to do over
I'm sure I'd win and lost just as much
but spend alot less time on right and wrong
and a lot more time on love
Half of my mistakes I'd give anything to change how it ended
Oh, and half of my mistakes, God, I wouldn't change one thing
You can lean too hard on a prayer but I don't recommend it
'Cause half the good things in my life came from half of my mistakes
Yeah, a lot of good things in my life came from half of my mistakesHypocrite, don't you know what you do,
Their eyes watching your every move?
You knaw the truth, but you live a lie
And slither down from your altar high
You say one thing and you do another
You say one thing and you do another
You burn the fields and poison the waters
Say one thing and you do another
You say one thing and you do another
It's a dead man's charade, liven' brother,
Hypocrite,
Don't you know what you do?
You're way too old if you're calling for peace
You're diagnosing, and you're the disease
You betrayed words on the shepherd's soul
Scatter the flock to the rocks below
You say one thing and you do another
You say one thing and you do another
You burn the fields and poison the waters
Say one thing and you do another
You say one thing and you do another
Tell me whose roof you're living under,
Hypocrite,
Don't you know what you do?
Don't tell anyone else. You're one to hiss!
Don't tell anyone else. you're one to hiss!
You say one thing and you do another
You say one thing and you do another
You burn the fields and poison the waters
Say one thing and you do another
You say one thing and you do another
I can't believe what I see in the mirror.I know the heartaches are coming cause I know you're going away
There's no gladness in your voice when you say darling
There's no love behind your lips when they touch mine
There's no feeling in your arms when they're around me
How much, could you say it's goodbye time
I know the heartaches are coming I know the sky will turn gray
I know the the tears will start falling cause I know you're going away
Arms that were friends now are strangers eyes that could see now are blind
Only tomorrows of sorrow from the day that you leave me behind
I know the heartaches are comingI said, "I know a shrimp boat captain out of Galveston"
I've been thinkin' I'd go down and work for a spell
Oh, you never can tell it just might suit me fine
Spend some time out on the bay
But then there's always cowboy work in Colorado
And I was thinkin' that that just might be the thing
Make a little pocket change I figure what the heck
Ain't nothin' standin' in my way
But then she smiled at me
Looked a while at me
And that changes everything
That's a whole "nother deal
That puts a brand new spin
On this ole rollin' wheel
That's some powerful stuff
That's a girl in love
And that's one thing
That changes everything
Well, I suppose on second thought this ole town ain't so bad
Wouldn't hurt me to unload this load of mine
And there's a for sale sign on a little house
I saw just about a mile or so from here
But I've always been the kind for pullin' up the stakes
It's ain't never been like me to put down roots
But now I'm thinkin', "Who am I kiddin'"
I ain't goin' nowhere
When she smiles at me
Looks a while at me
And that changes everything
That's a whole "nother deal
That puts a brand new spin
On this ole rollin' wheel
That's some powerful stuff
That's a girl in love
And that's one thing that changes everythingI bought a ring and gave it to your daughter Mrs Jones
She promised me that she would be my wife
But after she had talked to you she gave me back my ring
Mrs Jones your daughter cried all night
Mrs Jones your daughter cried all night you wouldn't give your blessings to our love
You said she should stop seeing me and maybe you are right
But Mrs Jones your daughter cried all night
Mrs Jones some day some man may bring your daughter wealth
And all the things that I could never buy
But Mrs Jones we love each other and wealth won't buy a love
And I guess that's why your daughter cried all night
Oh how I wish that I could be the man
Who has the wealth to win your daughter's hand
You know her life is in your hands and you hold on so tight
Mrs Jones your daughter cried all night
Mrs Jones your daughterLa, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
I only want to say
That if there is a way
I want my baby back with me
'Cause he's my true love my only one don't you see?
And on that fateful day
Perhaps in the new sun of May
My baby walks back into my arms
I'll keep him beside me forever from harm
You see I was afraid
To let my baby astray
I kept him too tightly by my side
And then one sad day he went away and he died
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
I only want to say
That if there is a way
I want my baby back with me
'Cause he's my true love my only one don't you see?From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
From the queen of flowing mountains to the southbelt by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome, and known quite well by all
She's the combination on the Wabash Cannonball
She came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she rolled into the station you could hear all the people say
There's a girl from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball
Ah buddy now - [ steel ]
Our eastern states are dandy so the people always say
From New York to St Louis and Chicago by the way
From the hills of Minnesota where the rippling waters fall
No changes can be taken on that Wabash Cannonball
Here's to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
And always be remembered round the ports of Alabam
His earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall
We'll carry him home to Vict'ry on the Wabash Cannonball
[ guitar ]
Now listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodlands through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hobo squall
You're trav'ling through the jungles on the Wabash CannonballChorus: You ought to see deacon Jones When he rattles the bones, Old parson Brown foolin' 'roun like a clown, Aunt Jemima who is past eighty three, Shoutin' "I'm full o' pep! Watch yo' step!, watch yo' step! One legged Joe danced aroun' on his toe, Threw away his crutch and hollered, "let 'er go!" Oh, honey, hail! hail! the gang's all here For an Alabama jubilee Mandolins, violins, Hear the darkies tunin' up, the fun begins, Come this way, don't delay, Better hurry, honey dear, or you'll be missin' Music sweet, rag-time treat, Goes right to your head and trickles to your feet, It's a reminder, a memory finder Of nights down in old Alabam'. Hear that flute, it's a beaut, And the tunes it's tootin', tootsie, ain't they cute? Let's begin, it's a sin, To be missin' all this syncopated music! Oh, you Jane, once again Give your legs some exercise to that refrain, Boy, that's what makes me so dreamy and takes me Back home to my old Alabam'.You say that you need
Someone you can depend on
I say that I need somebody too
So put your mind at ease
You know that you can count on
Me for anything you want me to do
I should have told you before
But this time you got through to me
So much more
So much more
You say that you need
A way to make your mind up
I need to find out which way to go
If you think you see me
Then maybe we will windup
Bringing back the time that I miss so
You know that there's so much we can do
We could have everything we need
Before we're through and more before we're through
Ah, la la la la
La la la
AhWell the last thing I need, is a lazy housewife
If your gonna lay around and sleep all day
You better work third shift a night
In a carpet mill or a truck stop, even if it's for minimum wage
Oh you can get yourself some pasties
And get up there on that stage
Now the baptist look down on you
But don't listen to their lip
'Cause you can dance butt naked on a big brass poll
As long as you're making tips
'Cause I want a paycheck woman don't want no welfare broad
All the chicks I date are lazy I say hey y'all get a job
You better bring home the bacon and fry it up when you get home
You can't sit and watch soap operas while I work hard all day long
So here's to all my brothers out there pulling down O.T.
Let me get a big hell yeah, from the working men like me
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Employee discounts, well their real nice
I hear the head cashier at Wal-Mart can get fishing lures half price
Ain't that sexy, really sexy when a woman saves money
But what really turns me on is a two income family
So even if it's part time
Bagging groceries at the store
You better get out there and punch that clock
'Cause I'm sick of being poor
I want a paycheck woman don't want no welfare broad
All the chicks I date are lazy I say hey y'all get a job
You better bring home the bacon and fry it up when you get home
You can't lay there eating Bon Bons while I work hard all week long
So here's to all the woman who think money grows on trees
Ah let me get a big hell no, from the working mens like me
Hell no, hell no
I want a paycheck woman don't want no welfare broad
All the chicks I date are lazy I say hey y'all get a job
You better bring home the bacon and fry it up when you get home
You can't sit and watch soap operas while I work hard all day long
So here's to all my brothers out there putting in forty

I was three years old
Splashin' everywhere
And so began my love affair
With water
On a river bank
With all my friends
A big old rope tied to a limb
And your a big old wuss
If you don't jump in
The water
Yeah when that summer sun starts to beatin' down
And you don't know what to do
Grab your swimming trunks
Ice up that old Igloo
Drive until the map turns blue
Daytona Beach on spring break
Eighteen girls up on stage
White t-shirts about to be sprayed
With water
Oh let'er go boys
Yeah when that summer sun starts to beatin' down
And you don't know what to do
Just go and grab someone you wanna see in a bathing suit
And drive until the map turns blue
You can stay right there
When the daylight's gone
Play truth or dare
And it won't take long
'Fore you and her got nothin' on
But water
All you really need this time of year
Is a pair of shades
And ice cold beer
And a place to sit somewhere near
WaterSit down honey gotta have us a talk
You man is a little upset
There's a couple of things that's been missing
And I ain't found ?em yet
I ain't pointing no fingers ain't layin?no blame
And I don't want to lose my cool
But you just don't fool with a country boy?s tool
Tool box
Now did I hear you right you loaned ?em out
To the neighbor down the road
Hey I?d just as soon you'd let him have my ole bird dog
Or my favorite fishing pole
Now there's one little lesson that you need to learn
You just don't fool with a country boy?s tool
Tool box
It was handed down from my daddy?s dad
Back in nineteen forty-two
And they may be rusty and they might be old
But they're kinda like my family jewels
Honey I love you but there's something else too
That I care about a heck of a lot
Oh you just don't fool with a country boy?s tool
Tool box
Now I don't want to hurt your tender heart
And I really do understand
That a friend in need is a friend indeed
And you offered a helping hand
But it something gets broke and it?s gotta be fixed
Well I don't blame you know who
'Cause you just don't fool with a country boy?s tool
Tool box
It was handed down from my daddy?s dad
Back in nineteen forty-two
And they may be rusty and they might be old
But they're kinda like my family jewels
Honey I love you but there's something else too
That I care about a heck of a lot
Oh you just don't fool with a country boy?s tool
Tool boxRedneck girl likes to cruise in Daddy's pickup truck
And a redneck girl plays her heart when she's down on her luck
Living for a Friday afternoon
She's gonna show one ole boy that weekend moon
And I pray that someday I will find me a redneck girl
Redneck girl likes to stay out all night long
She makes sweet rock n' roll while she listens to the country songs
She's waitin' for that moment of surrender
Her hands are calloused but her heart is tender
And I pray that someday I will find me a redneck girl
Oh give me a give me a give me a redneck girl
Give me a give me a give me a redneck girl
Oh give me a give me a give me a redneck girl
Give me a give me a give me a redneck girl
A redneck girl got a name on the back of her belt
She's got a kiss on her lips for her man and no one else
A coyote's howling out on the prairie
First comes love then comes marriage
And I pray that someday I will find me a redneck girl
Yeah give me a give me a give me a redneck girlHey hey good lookin' whatcha got cookin' how's about cookin' something up with me

Repeat ChorusIf money grew on hackberry trees,
And time wasn't such a luxury,
If love was lovesick over me,
That'd be alright.
If I could keep the wind in my sails,
Keep a hold of the tiger by the tail,
A half a ham sandwich in my lunch pail,
That'd be alright.
[Chorus]
Yeah, that'd be alright.
That'd be alright.
If everybody, everywhere,
Had a lighter load to bear,
And a little bigger piece of the pie.
We'd be livin' us a pretty good life,
And that'd be alright.
Hey, go heavy on the good and light on the bad,
A hair more happy and a shade less sad.
Turn all the negative down just a tad,
That'd be alright.
If my dear ol' dog never got old,
If the family farm never got sold.
If another bad joke never got told,
That'd be alright.
[Chorus: x3]
Yeah, that'd be alright.
That'd be alright.
Yeah, that'd be alright.
That'd be alright.
That'd be alright.I'm slow on my feet, and I'm lacking in grace,
And no one could ever look more out of place,
Than me on a dance floor with egg on my face,
Dancing an Irish waltz.
I looked up and couldn't believe what I saw,
The kind of face I'd only dreamed of before,
So I swallowed my pride, and I took to the floor,
As the band played an Irish waltz.
One two three went my heart, and we smiled as we swayed,
And the band sweetly played,
My legs felt like lead, there were stars in my head,
When we danced an Irish waltz.
I was clumsy and dark foot, and so ill at ease,
Blood rushed to my head while the strength left my knees,
But the moment that stole on my memories,
Is when we danced an Irish waltz?
One two three went my heart, and we smiled as we swayed,
And the band sweetly played,
My legs felt like lead, there were stars in my head,
When we danced an Irish waltz.
Oh we've been together for years since that night,
My two left feet still can't quite get it right,
Our children look on, and they laugh with delight,
When we danced an Irish waltz.
One two three went my heart, and we smiled as we swayed,
And the band sweetly played,
My legs felt like lead, there were stars in my head,
When we danced an Irish waltz.
We danced an Irish waltz.Sleigh bells ring
Are you listening
In the lane
Snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married? "
We'll say, "No man
But you can do the job when you're in town "
Later on
We'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Oh let's go walking
You know
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down
When it snows
Ain't it thrilling
Oh your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland
Look at you walking, come on
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland, oh let's go walkingThe mix tape's got a little Hank, little Drake
A little something bumping, thump, thumping on the wheel ride
The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think
So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right
The truck's jacked up, flat bills flipped back
Yeah you can find us where the party's at
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
And this is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon baby
This is how we roll
Yeah baby this is how we roll
We rollin' into town
With nothing else to do we take another lap around
Yeah holla at your boy if you need a ride
If you roll with me yeah you know we rollin' high
Up on and thirty seven needles, windows tinted hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat oh
Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw
This life I live it might not be for you but it's for me though
Let's roll!
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
And this is how we do
When the world turns ugly I just turn and look at you baby
This is how we roll
Yeah we're proud to be young
We stick to our guns
We love who we love and we wanna have fun
Yeah we cuss on them Mondays
And pray on them Sundays
Pass is around and we dream about one day
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up

And this is how we ride
We slingin' up the mud, cuttin' through the countryside baby

We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon baby
This is how we roll
Yeah this is how we rollCome all you good time people
While I've got money to spend
Tomorrow might be Monday
And I'd neither have a dollar nor a friend
Well I've got plenty of money in my pocket
My good time friends are around
But as soon as my pocketbook is empty
Not a friend on this earth can be found
I wrote my little woman a letter good people
And I told her I was in jail
She sent me back an answer
Sayin honey I'm a coming go your bail
But I'm still walking round
This old jail house this evening
Forty dollars won't pay my fine
Corn whiskey has surrounded my body poor boy
And my woman is troubling my mind
Lord my daddy told me a pretty good people
And my momma she told me more
Said son if you don't quit your rowdy ways
You'll have trouble at your door
If it wasn't for heartaches and trouble good people
Lord I would not be here today
I will ramble this whole world over
At home I cannot stay
Give me corn bread
On the table when I'm hungry
Something tall and cool when I'm dry
And a true loving woman to stand by me
Sweet heaven when I die
Go dig a hole in the meadow good people
Make it deep in that cold cold ground
Then gather around all you kind friends
And see this poor rounder go down
And when I'm dead and they buried me
With my pale face turned to the sun
Will you stand around and moan little woman
And think of the way you have doneA canvas covered cabin in a crowded labor camp stands out in this mem'ry I revive
'Cause my daddy raised a family there with two hard working hands
And tried to feed my mama's hungry eyes
He dreamed of something better and my mama's faith was strong
And us kids were just too young to realize
That another class of people put us somewhere just below
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted but it wasn't cause my daddy didn't try
She only wanted things she really needed one more reason for my mama's hungry eyes
I remember daddy praying for a better way of life
But I don't recall a change of any size
Just a little loss of courage as their age began to show
And one more sadness in my mama's hungry eyes
Mama never had the luxuries...
I still recall my mama's hungry eyesI like your lips like I like my Coca-Cola, yeah
Oh how it pops and fizzes
You like my shirt like I like it when you hold my hand
The way, it fits, has got me feeling lucky
Lookie, who is comin', whoo! You got that somethin'
Boy I wanna be where you are, and I'm gunnin' for ya'
Can't even fall for some other man, 'cause brother man,
You know how to get hip to my heart.
C'mon now!
All the girls in town look you up and look you down, I know
So, come on an' pick your kitten
Purr, baby, purr, go ahead and say the word, let's go!
I, think I'm the one you're takin', got me feeling lucky
Lookie, who is comin', whoo! You got that somethin'
Boy I wanna be where you are, and I'm gunnin' for ya'
Can't even fall for some other man, 'cause brother man,
You know how to get hip to my heart.
Tell me now, who? Who?
Tell me now, who? Who?
You play it cool, you play it so coo-coo-cool
And what am I supposed to do, when you play it so cool
And I got the hots for you?
Lookie, who is comin', whoo! You got that somethin'
Boy I wanna be where you are, and I'm gunnin' for ya'
Can't even fall for some other man, 'cause brother man,
You know how to get hip to my heart.
Lookie, who is comin', whoo! You got that somethin'
Boy I wanna be where you are, and I'm gunnin' for ya'
Can't even fall for some other man, 'cause brother man,
You know how to get hip to my heart.
I said, you know how to get hip to my heart.
I said, you know how to get hip to my heart.I never thought I'd feel
Feel the way I do
When I'm in your arms

Sing your melody to me
And if you want me to leave
I'd walk away from this old farm

Baby, baby,
There ain't no cows left for milking
Baby, baby,
There ain't no chickens laying nothing
I'll walk on anything for you

I'll walk off on anything for you
I'll walk off on anything for you
I was always told that
I would find somebody
I could keep a promise for
ba da ba ba
Words that don't mean a thing
To a broken-hearted man
I felt that way before
ba da ba ba
Baby, baby,
I don't remember feeling that way
Baby, baby,
And I owe it all to you
I'd take a nine to five for you
I'll take that nine to five for you

I'll work that nine to five for you
I'm convinced that nothings true
Just cause love worked out for you
Don't impress me no more
ba da ba ba
Words that don't mean a thing
To me I'm a broken-hearted man
I got dreams but nothing to hope for
ba da ba ba
Lady, lady,
Keep your distance I mean no good
Lady, lady,
I'm broken-hearted and I think the world should
All be broken-hearted too
All be broken-hearted too

Ya'll should be broken-hearted too
I'd like to give all my pain to you
If I could I'd give all my pain to youI thought love went south for the wintertime

Why don't you step down to the promise land?
Aw, here comes loveShe loves a violin, I love a fiddle
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
The lady I love loves silk and satin
She was raised uptown with a silver spoon
Well, I was born on a farm just south of Jackson
We had an old Ford tractor and a country moon
She loves a violin, I love a fiddle
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
She's Saks Fifth Avenue perfection
Caviar and dignified
Well, I live my life in WalMart fashion
And I like my sushi southern fried
She loves a violin, I love a fiddle
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
She loves a violin, I love a fiddle
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man
She's a blue blooded woman, I'm a redneck man.Que saudade amor
Estou sabendo que ai na Espanha tudo Ã© lindo
VocÃª me deixou
E aqui dentro meu coraÃ§Ã£o ficou partido
Nessa cidade, nÃ£o vou mais sorrir
Que bom seria, se SÃ£o Paulo fosse do lado de Madri
No puedo mÃ¡s mi corazÃ³n, ta doendo aqui na solidÃ£o
No puedo mÃ¡s vivir sin ti, volta logo pra SÃ£o Paulo
Ou eu vou pra Madri
Que saudade amor
Volta logo pro hemisfÃ©rio sul do mundo
Ficar sem vocÃª
Me mostrou o quanto Ã© bom estarmos juntos
Sonho tÃ£o lindo Ã© ter vocÃª aqui
Que bom seria, se SÃ£o Paulo fosse do lado de Madrid
No puedo mÃ¡s mi corazÃ³n, ta doendo aqui na solidÃ£o
No puedo mÃ¡s vivir sin ti, volta logo pra SÃ£o Paulo
Ou eu vou pra MadridEver since you left me I've been ridin' 'round
Crankin' up a little country gold heartbreak
Cried and dried these tears I don't know how
Much more missin' you I can take
I pray pray prayed, for a sign sign sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel
I take a shot of 'I don't care what you doing now'
Chase that one with a cold 'Screw you'
When that's done, I just might wash it down
With a big pitcher of 'Someone new'
That blond blonde blonde
At the bar bar bar
See if she wants to try and unbreak my heart heart heart
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel
When we were together
I thought life was set forever
Even though I knew better that the pain would never end
They say the night's darkest just before the dawn gets kissed
By the daybreak got down on my knees and I
Prayed, prayed, prayed, for a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnelI can make anybody pretty
I can make you believe any lie
I can make you pick a fight
With somebody twice
Your size
Well I've been known to cause a few breakups
And I've been known to cause a few births
I can make you new friends
Or get you fired from work.
And since the day I left Milwaukee
Lyncheburg Bordeaux, France
Been making the bars
With lots of big money
And helping white people dance
I got you in trouble in high school
And college now that was a ball
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me
Alcohol, alcohol
I got blamed at your wedding reception
For your best man's embarrassing speech
And also for those naked pictures of you at the beach
I've influenced kings and world leaders
I helped Hemingway write like he did
And I'll bet you a drink or two that I can make you
Put that lampshade on your head
And since the day I left Milwaukee
Lyncheburg Bordeaux, France
Been making a fool out of folks
Just like you
And helping white people dance
I am medicine and I am poison
I can help you up or make you fall
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me
Alcohol, alcohol
And since the day I left Milwaukee
Lyncheburg Bordeaux, France
Been making the bars
With lots of big money
And helping white people dance
I got you in trouble in high school
And college now that was a ball
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me
Alcohol, alcohol(Bill Owens)
Like the morning sun
His love moved across every inch of my body
And the heat from the fire burned me up with desire
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven for sure
This morning when I opened my eyes
There to my surprise
Lay that angel I thought had been only a dream
And so I said a little prayer
And thanked God, that he was there
Oh, this is a dream come true
Dream do come true
I know 'cause I found you
I never thought they did
But now I do
Dreams do come true
It was love at first sight
And it was love all night
And the way he made love to me
Fulfilled all my fantasies
Ooo, this is a dream come true
Yes, dreams do come true
I know 'cause I found you
I never thought they did
But you're living proof
That dreams do come true
Dreams do come true
And I am so in love with youAre you sincere when you say I love you
Are you sincere when you say I'll be true
Do you mean every word that my ears have heard
I'd like to know which way to go will our love grow are you sincere
Are you sincere when you say you miss me
Are you sincere every time you kiss me
And are you really mine every day all the time
I'd like to know which way to go will our love grow are you sincere
Tell me are you sincere are you sincere when you say you miss me
Tell me are you sincere every time every time that you kiss me
And are you really mineYou say tomorrow you're going
Well, that's so hard for me to believe
I'm making plans for the heartaches
'Cause you're making plans to leave
The tears for me will be falling
Like a tree shedding its leaves
I'm making plans for the tear drops
'Cause you're making plans to leave
You're making plans to forget me
I'm making plans to miss you
I'm getting ready to grieve
I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave
I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave
I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leaveWhen you found somebody new
I thought I never would
Forget you
For I thought then I never could
But time has taken all the pains away-ay
Until now, I'm down to hurtin'
Once a day
Once a day (once a day)
A-all day long (all day long)
And o-once a night (once a night)
From dusk till dawn (dusk till dawn)
The only time
I wish you weren't go-one
Is once a day
Everyday
All day long
I'm so glad that I'm not like
A girl I knew one time
She lost the one she loved
Then slowly lost her mind
She sat around and cried her life away-ay
Lucky me
I'm only cryin' once a day
Once a day (once a day)
A-all day long (all day long)
And o-once a night (once a night)
From dusk till dawn (dusk till dawn)
The only time
I wish you weren't go-one
Is once a day
Everyday
All day long
Once a day
Everyday
All day lo-ongBeen like a rolling wheel in these fertile fields
Since I was five years old
Between then and now I bet I've pulled this plow
About a million miles or so
I have never been nowhere, oh, but I don't care
To me there is no where else to go
And in all and all I am, it's just who I am
It's as complicated as new plowed earth
Simple as dirt
I love my wife and kids just like my daddy did
And my daddy's dad before
And their philosophy was handed down to me
Life is easy as a hard day's work
Simple as dirt
Well, I live my life one day at a time
That's the only way I know
Oh lord, I have paid my debts and I have no regrets
And I reap the things I sow
And I'll keep pulling weeds and planting seeds
Until I reach the end of the road
But you can lay me down this familiar ground
And on my stone carve just three words
Simple as dirt
I love my wife and kids just like my daddy did
And my daddy's dad before
And their philosophy was handed down to me
Life is easy as a hard day's work
Simple as dirt
Been like a rolling wheel through these fertile fields
Since I was five years oldThree hearts in a tangle one heart will have to break
Tonight as I sit by my window watching the people go by
I'm trying to reach a decision but I know I can't do what's right
Three hearts in a tangle which heart should I take
Three hearts in a tangle which heart will I break
If I choose the one that I should choose then the other heart would break
But if I'll leave them both then I'd suffer which heart will pay for my mistake
Three hearts in a tangle...Fairy tale fairy tale tell me now a fairy tale
Tell me once again how it's me that you adore
And how we gonna live so happily for ever more
Once upon a time not very long ago the whole magic world was mine
You made me believe then that you loved me so but that was once upon a time
For you never loved me so you went away my whole magic world fell in
That's when I found out you made up fairy tales better than the Brothers Grim
Fairy tale fairy tale...
[ keyboard ]
Wish you tell me what am I suppose to do with a castle in the air
Filled with broken dreams that never can come true since you are no longer there
Though I know you just don't love me anymore please help me to pretend
Take me in your arms the way you did before and tell a fairy tale again
Fairy tale fairy tale...
Fairy tale fairy tale...A little boy tugged gently
At a soldier's khaki sleeve.
He says, "Forgive me, mister;
But you've been across I believe.
I see the purple heart you wear
That tells what you've been through.
Perhaps you know my daddy, sir;
'Cause he's a soldier, too.
Did you see my daddy, mister soldier,
When you were fighting over there?
I thought perhaps by chance
You met him there in France,
Or somewhere over there
Across the sea.
It's been so long since daddy went away.
My mommy longs for him both night and day.
I know 'twould make her glad
If you had seen my dad.
Did you see my daddy over there?
The soldier's eyes grew misty
As he watched the boy's face,
For it recalled a memory
That time can not erase;
A buddy lost in action,
The best pal he ever had.
Till death he carried o'er his heart
A picture of this lad.
Did you see my daddy, mister soldier,
When you were fighting over there?
I thought perhaps by chance
You met him there in France,
Or somewhere over there across the sea.
It's been so long since daddy went away.
My mommy longs for him both night and day.
I know 'twould make her glad
If you had seen my dad.
Did you see my daddy over there?At last I found the way to free myself from you
And all the heartaches that you left to make me blue
I thought my world had ended when you said goodbye
Till I found three ways to ease the pain cry cry cry
I cry when I get lonely and sometimes when I'm blue
I cry each time I think about the times I cried for you
I'm sure that I'll get over you as time goes by
Cause I found three ways to ease the pain cry cry cry
[ steel ]
Maybe someday all the cheers will wash the hurt away
And drown all of my sorrow I pray for that day
But until the day that all my tears are dried
I'll have three ways to ease the pain cry cry cry
I cry when I get lonely...Gather round fellows I'll tell you some tales about murder and blueberry pies
And heroes and hells and bottomless wells and lullabys legends and lies
And gather round ladies come sit at my feet I'll sing about warm sunny skies
There's mermaids and beans and lovin' machines in my lullabys legends and lies
Lullabys legends and lies and lies lullabys legends and lies
I'll sing you a song then I'll shuffle along with my lullabys legends and lies
I may make you wonder I may make you smile I may bring the tears to your eyes
But when I disappear Lord you'll wish I was here with more lullabys legends and lies
So open the bottle and pass a guitar and look in my warm lovin' eyes
I'll take you to places you ain't been before with my lullabys legends and lies
Lullabys legends and lies...Baby, now that I've found you
I won't let you go
I build my world around you
I need you so, baby even though
You don't need me now
Baby, now that I've found you
I won't let you go
I build my world around you
I need you so, baby even though
You don't need me
You don't need me no no (mm)
Baby, baby, when first we met
I knew in this heart of mine
That you were someone I couldn't forget
I said right and abide my time
Spent my life looking for that somebody
To make me feel like you
Now you tell me that you want to leave me
But darling, I just can't let you
Baby, baby, when first we met
I knew in this heart of mine
That you were someone I couldn't forget
I said right and abide my time
Spent my life looking for that somebody
To make me feel like you
Now you tell me that you want to leave me
But darling, I just can't let you
Now that I found you
I build my world around you
I need you so, baby even though
You don't need me now
Baby, now that I've found you
I won't let you go
I build my world around you
I need you so, baby even though
You don't need me, you don't need me no no
(mm mm mm)I look out across corn rows from a dirt road
Baby's kicked back in the front seat
Got her bare fit hanging out the window
We take a trip down memory lane
Dirt on the truck, no chance of rain
My third generation farming friends all pray that its on the way
And if it don't show up, we'll be alright
Because folks round here wouldn't take a million
For a different life
[Chorus]
Home sweet home
I thank my lucky stars at night
I was raised down here and raised up right
And my pride, you've got that right
Home sweet home
Where a little bit goes long way
And we shut her down on sundays
I wont ever get too far away
From Home sweet home
Pull down to the cane bridge
Park in the ditch
Folks and poles are lined up
A little kid holds a stringer up
Got a mess of fish
I drive away with a smile on my face
Knowing that this place is blessed
By God's amazing grace
[Chorus]
Know matter I go
Or where the road might leave
This little speck on the map, will always be
[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm coming home.Caleb Meyer, he lived alone
In them hollarin' pines
He made a little whiskey for himself
Said it helped to pass the time
Late one evening in back of my house,
Caleb came around
He called my name 'til I came out
With no one else around
[Chorus]
Caleb Meyer, your ghost is gonna
Wear them rattlin' chains.
But when I go to sleep at night,
Don't you call my name
Where's your husband, Nellie Kane
Where's your husband gone?
Did he go down off the mountain side
And leave you all alone?
Yes, my husband's gone to Bowlin' Green
To do some business there.
Then Caleb threw that bottle down
And grabbed me by my hair.
[Chorus]
He threw me on the needle bed,
And on my dress he lay
He held my hands above my head
And I commenced to pray.
I cried My God, I am your child
Send your angels down
Then feelin' with my fingertips,
The bottle neck I found
I pulled that glass across his neck
As fine as any blade,
And I felt his blood run fast and hot
Around me where I laid.
[Chorus: x2](There's more pretty girls than one)
I am a rambling man I just ramble this world around
I've always been a roubler boy since my girl turned me down
There's more pretty girls than one there's more pretty girls than one
Every town I ramble around there's more pretty girls than one
Now listen to me all you ramblers let me tell you what you'd do
Don't fall in love with a pretty little girl unless you know she's true
There's more pretty girls than oneI saw a little beam of sunlight
Steal across a purple sky
And bent down to kiss a rose bud
Oh, it made me wanna cry
And to think that I've been permitted
To see a part of nature's plan
Oh, there's nothing that stands out more
Than the selfishness in man
Little children painting pictures
Of the blooms and apple trees
Oh, why can't the grown up people
Have faith of one thing?
And to think those tiny fingers
Might become a killer's hand
Oh, there's nothing that stands out more
Than the selfishness in man
Why can't we see the folly?
And the uselessness of pain
Love could lead to understanding
Maybe it's not too late
Then perhaps through His great wisdom
We might learn to understand
Then there'd be no shame or sorrow
And no selfishness in man
Then perhaps through His great wisdom
We might learn to understand
Then there'd be no shame or sorrow
And no selfishness in manStars of our stars.
Dreams of my dreams.
You come to me
Singing " The Stars Of Our Stars".
[Chorus]
The stars of our stars
Came up the first day.
The moon did set.
The sun comes up.
And all the stars did disappear.
Stars of our stars.
Dreams of my dreams.
You come to me
Dancing to "The Stars Of Our Stars".
[Chorus]
Times at night in the spill of light
You catch a glimpse.
You make a start with an eager heart,
But it always slips.
And then everything shifts.
Stars of our stars.
Dreams of my dreams.
You come to me
Trailing "The Stars Of Our Stars".
[Chorus]Can I beg can I borrow
Can I steal one more tomorrow
The day is done another wasted
Why do I spend them all waiting
As the last
Shadow falls
Hear my prayer
Hear my call
What is here what was never
What will last what's gone forever
Twists and turns then it splinters
One day sweet next day bitter
Shifting sands
Underneath
Knock me off
Of my feet
Take a breath then take another
One last step take cover
Time is short unfurl my fingers
Shine a light where darkness lingers
All is lost
All is found
Say goodbye
To the groundIn a simple life dreams die hard
You never let 'em go
All the while you play your hands
And you may never know
Why it's always lady luck
On someone else's palm they read
You holding my two hands
Is really all I need
I can get by if it all fell through
Right down to the bottom of my list
I can get by lookin' back on life
Find that I've too many things I've missed
I can get by without doing
All the crazy things some people do
But I wouldn't want to try even
Barely gettin' by without you
Many things I've come to need
That I could do without
And many more I've done without
I could come to need
The one thing that I'd fight to keep
Until my days are through
Is when I lay me down to sleep
I'm lyin' next to you
I can get by if it all fell through
Right down to the bottom of my list
I can get by lookin' back on life
Find that I've too many things I've missed
I can get by without doing
All the crazy things some people do
But I wouldn't want to try even
Barely gettin' by without you
I can get by if it all fell through
Right down to the bottom of my list
I can get by lookin' back on life
Finding I've too many things I've missed
Barely gettin' by without you
I can get by if it all fell through
Right down to the bottom of my list
I can get by lookin' back on life
Find that I've too many things I've missed
I can get by without doing
All the crazy things some people do
But I wouldn't want to try even
Barely gettin' by without youHe was sittin' at the bar, sippin' on a regular Coke
We were drinkin' and smokin' and makin' him the butt of our jokes
We all said, "Man, what happened to you? Why can't you just have a few?"
He said, "I would if I could, but it's probably best that I don't."
'Cause the more I drink, the more I drink
Yeah, I'm the world's greatest lover and a dancin' machine
I get loud, I get proud, and it gets worse
Well, if I have one, I'll have thirteen
Naw, there ain't no in-between
'Cause the more I drink, the more I drink
A couple of cold ones, and somebody hands me a shot
Hell, even buck-tooth and bow-legged women start lookin' hot
And pretty soon I'm bummin' cigarettes, and sweet talkin' some big brunette
Yeah, once I get on a roll, ain't no tellin' where I'll stop
'Cause the more I drink, the more I drink
Yeah, I'm the world's greatest lover and a dancin' machine
I get loud, I get proud, and it gets worse
Well, if I have one, I'll have thirteen
Naw, there ain't no in-between
'Cause the more I drink, the more I drink
Yep, yep
Hmm, that's what I'm talking about
Man, if I have one, I'll have thirteen
And they can't get me off the karaoke machine
The more I drink, the more I drink
Yeah, the more I drink, the more I drink, the more I drinkMy daddy and my mama and me walkin' on this old burnt ground
Must be a hundred and three travelin' from town to town
Maybe we can find work today sweatin' in this old hot sun
Then we can buy something to eat before another day is done
The harvest has sure been slow the drought hit us hard this year
But daddy said we'd have to go winter mustn't find us here
So my daddy and my mama and me packed everything we owned
Put it in this old suitcase and left the place that we called home
Now daddy isn't gettin' any younger and mama bless her heart looked so sad
But we've always been a family with lots of pride
And thankful for everything that we've had
So I know that somehow we're gonna make it
It's gonna take me than this old drought to stop us you'll see
I've got a feeling the grass is gonna be greener for my daddy and my mama and me
My daddy and my mama and me...
My daddy and my mama and me just my daddy and my mama and meUh...I met Shania Twain and I met ol Tim McGraw
Billy Ray Cyrus and little David Ball
A little bit of luck and my life will be complete
There's a little bitty blonde that I'd really want to meet
I sure like Mindy McCready
Start pumpin iron and a-eatin my Wheaties
Got to get in shape
If I want to get a date
But first I gotta lose a little bit of weight
My little bitty sweetie in her little nighty gown
A litty bitty kiss and I'd probably come unwound
I love to watch her dance and I like to watch her sing
Want a little better look at her belly button ring
I sure like Mindy McCready
Take a little ride down to Panama City
Just the two of us on her little bitty bus
With a whole lot of love and whole lot of lust
I work a little job for a crummy little check
Heck I'd trade it all for a hug around the neck
Paid a lot of hope for my little bitty scheme
Cause I could never fit in her litte bitty jeans
I'm a good old boy she's a pretty little girl
Wish I had a chance to rock her little bitty world
I'm a little bit insane cause I love her somethin fierce
Gonna go and get my big old belly button pierced
I'd sure like to meet Mindy McCready
Give me half a chance and buddy yes indeed-why
Guys do it all the time I'd better get in line
Better go and buy her some of Deana Carter's wine
I sure love Mindy McCready
Start pumpin iron and a-eatin my Wheaties
Got to get in shape
If I want to get a date
BeDaddy won a radio, tuned it to a country show
I was rockin' in the cradle to the cryin' of a steel guitar
Mama used to sing to me, she taught me that sweet harmony
Now she worries 'cause she never thought I'd ever really take it this far
Singin' in the bars and
[Chorus]
Chasin' that neon rainbow, livin' that honky tonk dream
'Cause all I've ever wanted, is to pick this guitar and sing
Just tryin' to be somebody, just wanna be heard and seen
Chasin' that neon rainbow, livin' that honky tonk dream
An atlas and a coffee cup, five pickers in an old Dodge truck
Headin' down to Houston for a show on Saturday night
This overhead is killin' me, half the time I sing for free
But when the crowd's into it Lord it makes this thing I'm doing seem right
Standin' in the spotlight
[Chorus]
Daddy's got a radio, he won it thirty years ago
He said "Son I just know we're gonna hear you singin' on it someday"
I made it up to Music Row, but Lordy don't the wheels turn slow
Still I wouldn't take a minute and I wouldn't have it any other way
Just show me to the stage
(Chorus)
I'm chasin' that neon rainbow, livin' that honky tonk dream.Too ra loo ra loo ral
Too ra loo ra li
Too ra loo ra loo ral
Hush, now don't you cry
Too ra loo ra loo ral
Too ra loo ra li
Too ra loo ra loo ral
That's an Irish lullaby
Over in Killarney
Many years ago
My mother sang a song to me
In tones so soft and low
Just a simple, little ditty
In her good old Irish way
And I'd give the world if I could hear
That song of hers today
Too ra loo ra loo ral
Too ra loo ra li
Too ra loo ra loo ral
Hush, now don't you cry
Too ra loo ra loo ral
Too ra loo ra li
Too ra loo ra loo ral
That's an Irish lullabyTonight again you'll be holding another tenderly
Whispering soft sweet words you once spoke to me
While I'm here a lonely living old memories
Of the precious love you once gave to me
Then softly and tenderly tears touch my cheeks
Invisible tears no one ever sees
Softly and tenderly my heart still beats
For only you and all the love you gave to me
[ piano ]
It seems to me that you're reaching for a world that don't exist
Searching for new lips that you've never kissed
When I think I find your conscience has suddenly gone blind
I find I wonder who if you were ever really mine
Then softly and tenderly...
For only you and all the love you gave to meWon't you tell me if you can what's the matter with a man
When he starts a stayin' out all night
He's been a steppin' outta line and a messin' off my mind
And don't you know that that ain't right
'Cause ever since I was a little bitty teeny girl
He thought he was the only man in this whole world
But now he bettter do some thinkin' and then he'll find
He's got the only mama that'll walk the line
While I'm workin' every day all he wants do is play
And I'm gettin' tired of bein' here alone
And I'm a comin' unglued from his funny little moods
When he finally come a dragging home
'Cause ever since I was a little bitty teeny girl
I keep a packin' up my clothes but everybody knows
That I'm really just a puttin' him on
Now when I start a walkin' after when you'll hear him squawkin'
And a beggin' me to come back home
'Cause ever since I was a little bitty teeny girl
He's got the only mama that'll walk the lineCondemned without trial no chance to explain
Sentenced to be lonely despised
Condemned without trial to heartaches and pain
I thought that you demand me from the life
As heaven's my judge and the world is my jury
I'm faithful I swear that I am
Condemned without trial someday you may be
Then you'll think of me and understand
[ guitar - piano ]
As heavens my chance...Sweetest little fellow everybody knows
Don't know what to call him but he's mighty like a rose
Looking at his mommy with eyes so shiny blue
Makes you think that heaven dear is coming close to you
When he's there a sleeping in his little place
Think I see the angels looking through the lace
When the dark is falling when the shadows creep
Then they come on tip-toe to kiss him in his sleep
Sweetest little fellow everybody knows...
[ string ]
When the dark is falling...
Sweetest little fellow everybody knows...1, 2
1, 2, 3, 4
I thought I saw you in a car
I thought I saw you on a morning train
Saw you walkin in a bar
I thought I saw you in a car
I thought I saw you in a magazine
I thought I saw you in a movie screen
I made a wish upon a star
I thought I saw you a traffic cop
I thought I saw you at a bus stop
I see you everywhere you are
I thought I saw you in a car
I thought I saw you in a country club
I thought I saw you you were cleaning up
I thought I saw you and your eyes were shut
I thought I saw you in a car
I thought I saw you on a fine-trimmed lawn
It seemed like everybody else was gone
You were dancin in the dark
I thought I saw you in a car
I thought I saw you on a side road
I saw you broken down, you know
Never tore me right apart
I thought I saw you in a car
I thought I saw you on a morning train
You know it nearly drove me insane
I think you've taken it too far
I thought I saw you in a car
I thought I saw you in a car
I thought I saw you in a car
I thought I saw you in a car
I thought I saw you in a carI'm a simple man living a complex life
I did a whole lot of things all wrong before I learned them right
The first time I felt like a man was in the eye of a storm
Watching the woman I love feeding our first born
Nobody knows about the here and after
What really does and doesn't matter
The question's tough but the answer's simple enough
First comes love, first comes love
Take a good long look at her body, she's built by God
Sent a charge right through my soul like a lightning rod
But time has a way of beating down passion's flame
It comes on strong and wild, then it gets real tameDamn she hurts the morning after
Drunk on thinking I could have her
Strung her out long like lights on a balcony
Come wasted, she don't care
Tuesday night I had her here
Like beads and feathers, it was heaven her hanging on me
She took me for a ride, hit a new high
Throwing confetti in her green eyes
Trying like hell to hold the bell of a ball
She pulled me in a world of wonder
It's a charade trying to love her
It's like trying to save a soul from Mardi Gras
From Mardi Gras
Trashed my heart just like these streets
Her perfume's all over me
Just reminded me of a night I can't forget
She paraded me around
Swirled eyes, not I had a crown on my head till she left
Thought she'd stay, but instead
She took me for a ride, hit a new high
Throwing confetti in her green eyes
Trying like hell to hold the bell of a ball
She pulled me in a world of wonder
It's a charade trying to love her
It's like trying to save a soul from Mardi Gras
From Mardi Gras
From Mardi Gras
She ain't looking for love
No she's just looking for a real good time
And you can't change her weather
She's a hurricane every time
She took me for a ride, hit a new high
Throwing confetti in her green eyes
Trying like hell to hold the bell of a ball
She pulled me in a world of wonder
It's a charade trying to love her
It's like trying to save a soul from Mardi Gras
From Mardi Gras
From Mardi Gras
From Mardi Gras
(Mardi Gras)I live one day at a time I dream one dream at a time
Yeasterday's dead and tomorrow is blind I just live one day at a time
Guess that's your surprise to see me back at home
You know how much I miss you when I'm gone
But don't ask how long I planned to stay it never crossed my mind
I live one day at a time
I live one day at a time I dream one dream at a time
Yeasterday's dead and tomorrow is blind I just live one day at a time
I live one day at a time[Chorus:]
On the wings of a snow-white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above (Sign from above)
On the wings of a dove (Wings of a dove)
When troubles surround us, when evils come
The body grows weak (Body grows weak)
The spirit grows numb (Spirit grows numb)
When these things beset us, He doesn't forget us
He sends down His love (Sends down His love)
On the wings of a dove (Wings of a dove)
[Chorus]
When Noah had drifted on the flood many days
He searched for land (He searched for land)
In various ways (Various ways)
Troubles, he had some but wasn't forgotten
He sent him His love (Sent him His love)
On the wings of a dove (Wings of a dove)
[Chorus x 2]
On the wings of a dove (Wings of a dove)
[Repeat to Fade]From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
From the queen of flowing mountains to the southbells by the moor
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear the lonesome hoboes squall
They're traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball
She came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she pulled into the station you could hear all them people say
There's a gal from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear the lonesome hoboes squall
They're traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball
[ ac.guitar ]
Well the eastern states are dandy so the people always say
From New York to St Louis and Chicago by the way
From the hills of Minnesotta where the wrippling waters fall
No changes can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle...We fight and we makeup
We're cool then we breakup
Like it's the last time
But it ain't the first
We leave and we run back
Baby, so much that
Everyone says that
It'll never work
Yeah, we're in it one minute
Then we're flipping that switch
Yeah, it's on again off again
We got that mad love
Haters gonna hate seein'
You and me together
Some kinda crazy
But that's us
Doin' our thing
Throwing more gas on the fire
Sure as the rain
Rolling off of this roof
You'll get her crying
Like Johnny and June
We got that mad love
Can't stop this mad love
She give me the goodbyes
Break out the long nights
Baby I know when
The blames died down
Find us some rescue
Alone in the bedroom
Turning on the night
And turn it back around
We got that mad love
Haters gonna hate seein'
You and me together
Some kinda crazy
But that's us
Doin' our thing
Throwing more gas on the fire
Sure as the rain
Rolling off of this roof
You'll get her crying
Like Johnny and June
We got that mad love
Can't stop this mad love
Oh no, baby
Yeah, we're in it one minute
Then we're flipping that switch
Yeah, it's on again off again
We got that mad love
Haters gonna hate us
Yeah, you and me together
Some kinda crazy
That's us
Doin' our thing
Throwing more gas on the fire
As sure as the rain
Rolling off of this roof
You'll get her crying
Like Johnny and June
We got that mad love
Can't stop this mad love
We got that mad love
Can't stop this mad love
YeahToday I found a dollar on the sidewalk so I went and bought a jug of wine
And I'll sit here in this alley and keep drinkin'
Until the thoughts of mama leaves my mind
Here's a toast to mama do you miss me do you even think about me anymore
Mama did you even stop to kiss me when you left me laying at a stranger's door
Oh how I wish I could've known you mama maybe now I wouldn't feel the shame
Maybe now I wouldn't feel so empty cause mama I don't even know your name
Here's a toast to mama...I'm gonna to fit in
I'm on the list
I'm gonna to get in
Haven't you heard
Don't you know who I am
I'm with the Joneses
I'm their best friend
I came to saturate the market
To perpetuate the hip kid
I was born so I could fall in line
I'm a legend in my own mind
Can I blend in with your kind?
I need you to liberate me
You the masses educate me
Hold my fist into the air
Declare a social victory
You can own me, you control me
Individuality has never stood a chance against you
Jump into the mainstream
Your revolution
Gets in the way of my confusion
I need someone to tell me who I am
Because Im under this illusion
I came to separate the classes
To place the fails above the passes
And there has never been a better time
To set the bar beneath the masses
Can I blend in with your kind?
I need you to liberate me
You the masses educate me
Hold my fist into the air
Declare a social victory
You can own me, you control me
Individuality has never stood a chance against you
Jump into the mainstream
I need you to liberate me
You the masses educate me
Hold my fist into the air
Declare a social victory
You can own me, you control me
Individuality has never stood a chance against you
Jump into the mainstream
Your revolution
Into the mainstream kid
Your revolution
Into the mainstream
Your revolution
Into the mainstream kid
Your revolution
Into the mainstream kid
Jump into the mainstream kidI love you because you understand, dear
Every little thing I try to do
Your always there to lend a helping hand dear
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you
No matter what may be the style or season
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for a hundred, thousand reasons
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you
(Most of, most of all I love you because you're you)
I love you because my heart is lighter
Every time I'm walking by your side
I love you because the future's brighter
The glow to happiness you've opened wide
No matter what the world may say about me
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you 'cause you're youNow blue ain't the world for the way that I feel
And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now you're not mine
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
For my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time
So please take the treasured dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday my crazy arms may hold somebody new but now I'm so lonely all the time
Crazy arms that reach...You say it was this mornin? when you last saw your good friend
Lyin? on the sidewalk with the misery on his brain
Stoned on some new potion he found upon the wall
Of some unholy bathroom in some ungodly hall
He only had a dollar to live on ?till next Monday
But he spent it all on comfort for his mind
Did you say you think he's blind?
Someone should call his parents or a sister or a brother
And they'll come and take him back home on a bus
But he?ll always be a problem to his poor and puzzled mother
And he?ll always be another one of us
He said he wanted heaven but prayin? was too slow
So he bought a one-way ticket on an airline made of snow
Did you say you saw your good friend flyin? low
You say it was this mornin? when you last saw your good friend
Lyin? on the sidewalk with the misery on his brain
Stoned on some new potion he found upon the wall
Of some unholy bathroom in some ungodly hall
Did you say you saw your good friend flyin? low
Dyin? slow, blinded by snowIt's snowing out there in the gloaming I've sat here and watched it all night
Little kids will be thrilled when they awaken and look at the fields deep and white
But the snow makes me think of my darling how she hated the snow and the cold
Now she lies in a grave back in Knoxville with a headstone that's just one year old
Please make the winter go quick Lord so the flowers around her can grow
I can't stand the thought of my loved one lying there in the deepening snow
Little Nancy climbs upon my knee now and I guess she's much too young to know
That the kiss I give was meant for her mother lying there in the deepening snow
Please make the winter go quick Lord
Lying there in the deepening snow[Chorus:]
I've got a whole lot of things to sing about
I've gotta whole lotta things to say
Like I love you and I need you
Every night and day
I've gotta a whole lot of things I want to do
I've gotta a whole lotta dreams to dream
And I want you here beside me
Every step of the way
I was lonely as anyone could ever be
Til you came along and gave your love to me
Now that empty world that you just walked into
Is filled with sunshine and music and the song is you
[Chorus]
People wonder just what has happened to me
They say I'm not at all the way I used to be
They don't realize I've just begun to live
And I'm wrapped up completely in all the love you giveBack home, back home
Yes, I'm going back home
Why I can't believe it's been this long
Since I've seen mom and dad
When I left my mountain home behind
I left them both so sad
My brothers and my sisters that were babies then are grown
Years have past and now at last, I'm on my way back home
Back home, back home
Yes I'm going back home
To the factory smoke and city life, I'm sayin' so long
I've shed a lot of tears through all the years that I've been gone
And I've spent a lot of time a' wishin' I could go back home
I got a letter from mama an'
Mama asked me if I'd come back home
She says it sure is lonesome now
Since all of us kids are all growed up and gone
I just can't hardly stand the thoughts of
Momma and daddy being left there all alone
That's really all I need to know
And now I'm on the road back home
Back home, back home
Yes, I'm going back home
To the smog an' smoke an' city life, I'm sayin' so long
I've shed a lot of tears through all the years that I've been gone
And I've spent a lot of time a' wishin' I could go back homeStared out just a young cowboy writin' songs on a cheap guitar
Melodies were kind of rough but you knew they came from the heart
But if not for you I'd never could have ever got this far
Yeah you helped me grow and I owe you more than you'll ever know
From the days at the Terrace Ballroom well me made it up to Symphony Hall
I played my songs and you sang along and man we really had a ball
And you brought your little children and I've seen 'em all grow tall
Yeah I watched you grow and I owe you more than you'll ever know
And all the wild and wooly cowboys dancin' and yellin' for more
Your hats and suites an cowboy boots stompin' on a hardwood floor
And you qaltzed those Utah ladies beneath the spotlight glow
Yeah you helped me grow and I owe you more than you'll ever know
I owe you more than you'll ever knowI threw our rings into a box
Filled with broken memories and fools gold
And I woke up again last night in this lonely bed without you to hold
And I walked around the house pullin' pictures off the walls
Just like I've done a hundred times before
Makin sure I've got 'em all
Chorus
Makin sure I've got the hard to find
Little things that make me think about you
'Cause I'm tired if this house always breakin' me down, feelin blue
No there's nothing left to say
I'm puttin' memories away
Well, yesterday I found your dress
I guess there's some things I missed in our room
But it didn't break me down the second that I found it like it used to
With red wine and tears I've been gatherin' all the years we spent together
I need to move on
'Cause I know you're gone forever
Repeat Chorus
No there's nothing left to say
I'm puttin' memories awayWhen I look up at the heavens when day is through
Once again there's a good day I'll hold to you
With the world to watch over still you watch me too I'm grateful grateful
When I sit at my table I say a prayer
Bout the good things upon it that you put there
And my loved ones around it not empty chair I'm grateful Lord to Thee
You have brought me good times you have brought me bad times
But through the good and bad times you always send me a song to sing
When I lie on my pillow I say a prayer
For the blessings you send me and load and care
And the world full of sunshine and my help is there I'm grateful grateful Lord to TheeEmma's in a part of town
Where she doesn't recognize the streets
Named for famous native sons
And out of every crevice comes creeping
A threat in her direction
Lucy's outside her home
Heading towards her corner store
She stays on well-traveled paths
And is always making sure
That she doesn't develop patterns
There are trap lines
Running up and down Main Street
Wire snares thirsting for your neck and feet
Susan doesn't like the way her curtains
Are blowing in the wind
She swears she locked that window
Before she went out dancing
She stands frozen in her doorway
Judy hears a sound coming from the other room
She knows she should be alone
'cause the kids left at noon
To go visit their father
Quick to your phone dial 911
Invite a strange man into your home
Who'll be carrying a gun
Leslie's working late
She's got a deadline to meet
In walks her boss,
Upon her desk he puts his feet
And says alone at last
Reanne's got a new boyfriend
And they're getting along
Until he locks the door and says don't struggle,
I'm stronger than you are.
Just one question I'm dying to ask, you said,
Do you know what it's like to be hunted?Written by billy burnette.
Seems like this is gonna be one of those days
I feel if as I reach the door
The sun is covered by that same
Old man-made haze
California lives no more
I can't believe it's just been twenty years ago
A lot of people got surprised
Over-crowded cities, not a problem anymore
The end is near, we realize
So help! we need somebody not some artificial mind
We've come across so many things
We thought we'd never find
Haley's comet's gone
We're barely holding onFrom a phone booth in Cheyenne
I made a promise to Diane
No more rodeos
I'd gone my last go 'round
The same promise that I made
In San Antone and Santa Fe
But tonight I saddled up
And let her down
Wild horses keep draggin' me away
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday
Wild horses just stay wild
And her heart is all I break
Wild horses keep draggin' me away
She'll watch me drive around her block
Gettin' courage up to stop
To make her one more promise
That I can't keep
The way I love the rodeo
I guess I should let her go
Before I hurt her more
Than she loves me
Wild horses keep draggin' me away
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday
Wild horses just stay wild
And her heart is all I break
Wild horses keep draggin' me away
Wild horses keep draggin' me away
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday
Wild horses just stay wild
And her heart is all I break
Wild horses keep draggin' me awayChestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Can help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from 1 to 92
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from 1 to 92
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to youIn the beautiful hills in the mists of Roane County
There's where I have roamed for many long years
There's where my heart's been tendin most ever
There's where the first step of misfortune I made
It's about thirty years when I courted and married
Armanda Gilbraith I'd soon call my wife
My brother he stabbed me for some unknown reason
Just three month's later I'd taken Tom's life
I was captured and tried in the village of Kingston
Not a man in that county would speak one kind word
When the jury came in with the verdict next mornin'
A lifetime in prison was the words that I heard
When the train pulled out poor Mother stood weepin'
And sister she sat all alone with a sigh
And the last words I heard was "Willy God bless you"
Was "Willy God bless you God bless you goodbye"
In the scorching hot sand of the foundry I'm workin'
Toiling and working my poor life away
They'll measure my grave on the banks of old Cumberland
Just as soon as I finish the rest of my days
Poort Martha was grave, but Corey was better
There's better and worse, although you may see
Boys when you write home from this prison in Nashville
Place one of my songs in your letter for meAll aboard
It was a big night in December, Chattanooga Tennessee
All the old folks still remember that snowy Christmas Eve
The way Santa saved that holiday, it's still hard to believe
Oh, the weather man was calling for the snow to keep comin' down
And the way that it was fallin', Rudolph never saw the ground
By Christmas day, Santa's sleigh never made it to town
Then all at once they heard that mighty whistle blow (ha ha)
The ground started shaken', it even shook the mistletoe
And then comin' 'round the mountain , right through the steam and smoke
Pullin' sixteen, coaches shoutin' ho ho ho
Who needs a sleigh, Santa's got a choo-choo train
Well now, he could barely hold it comin' down the hill so fast
Yeah that shiny locomotive made it town in no time flat
But you can't go slow with a Christmas load coming down the railroad tracks
When he pulled into the station and he finally shut her down
There was a big old celebration, everyone gathered 'round
They passed out toys to the girls and boys from miles around
Then all at once they heard a mighty whistle blow (ha ha)
The ground started shaken', it even shook the mistletoe
And then goin' 'round the mountain , right through the steam and smoke
Pullin', sixteen coaches shoutin' ho, ho, ho
Who needs a sleigh, when Santa's got a choo-choo train
Oh yeah, ain't need to fly away, Santa's got a choo-choo train
Hmm, hmmm, yeah(Dolly Parton)
Darlin' you're the highlight of my life
You're the one that makes it all worth while
You're the one that taught me how to smile
Darlin' you're the highlight of my life
You're a part of every dream I dream
You're my love, my life, my everything
I'll never love another how could I
When darlin' you are the highlight of my life
Darlin' you're the highlight of my life
You're the one that makes it all worth while
You're the one that taught me how to smile
Darlin' you're the highlight of my life
You're the one I always think about
And you're the one I couldn't live without
And you've always been my guiding light
Darlin' you're the highlight of my life
Darlin' you're the highlight of my life
You're the one that makes it all worth while
You're the one that taught me how to smile
Darlin' you're the highlight of my life
Darlin' you're the highlight of my lifeFor years we fought the night
With pale and ghostly flames
Some still dream of light
So the sun will rise again
We'll cure our need for wrongs
In cool and measured crime
We'll learn to drift in palm
From our hearts and from our minds
Let us not be faithless
You will meet our needs
A good and gracious wordless
Will lamp unto our feet
For years we've closed our eyes
While rust on reason grows
Feed and clothe our lies
In our hearts we know, yeah, we know
Wisdom lends us all
Cool and steady hand
Steel pressed to my palm
Doesn't make me more a man
So courage for the givers
Do what must be done
To deal out truth and justice
With swift and sober guns
For years you met our thirst
Still deserts we have roamed
We'll be done with dust and dirt
When the ocean calls us home
And fall into the arms
Of a cool and sweet embrace
And under stars and waving palms
Shed our sin like snakes
But time will cease to stalk us
Death will be undone
We'll shine with the light of
A thousand blazing suns
Time will cease to stalk us
Death will be undone
We'll shine with the light of
A thousand blazing sunsI'm gonna lay around the shack till the mail train comes back
Then I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms
Well I ain't gonna work on the railroad I ain't gonna work on the farm
Hey I'll lay around the shack till the mail train comes back
And roll in my sweet baby's arms
Well I'm rollin' in my sweet baby's arms rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
Lay around the shack till the mail train comes back
Then I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms
Well now where were you last Saturday night while I was a lyin' in jail
Hey you're walkin' the streets with another man wouldn't even go my bail
Well I'm rollin' in
Well now mama's a beauty operator sister can wheel and can spin
Hey now daddy owns an interest in an old cotton gin watch that all money roll in
Well I'm rollin' inI tried so hard, my dear, to show you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid, each thing I do is just an evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life, to try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
There was a time when I believed you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart
Why can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heartWill the real me please stop crying and let me let me forget
There are three faces that I wear the first says I don't care
The second one knows he's lying
The third one hide the heart that's been broken all apart
Will the real me please stop crying
Will the real me please stop crying lonely lonely tears of regret
Will the real me please stop crying and let me let me forget
[ steel ]
All three faces belong to me but there's one that no one sees
All of them know his love's dying

Makes me want to stop and cry
I recall the day it took you away
I'm blue, I'm lonesome too
When I hear that whistle blow
I want to pack my suitcase and go
The lonesome sound of a train going by
Makes me want to stop and cry
In the still of the night in the pale moonlight
The wind, it moans and cry
These lonesome blues I just can't lose
I'm blue, I'm lonesome tooWell I'm a gonna raise a fuss, I'm gonna raise a holler
About workin' all summer just to try an' earn a dollar
Everytime I call my baby, to try to get a date
My boss says, no dice, son, you gotta work late
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
Well my mom 'n papa told me, son, you gotta make some money
If you want to use the car to go ridin' next sunday
Well I didn't go to work, told the boss I was sick
Now you can't use the car 'cause you didn't work a lick
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
I'm gonna take two weeks, gonna have a vacation
I'm gonna take my problem to the united nation
Well I called my congressman and he said quote
I'd like to help you son, but you're too young to vote
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
Well I'm a gonna raise a fuss, I'm gonna raise a holler
About workin' all summer just to try an' earn a dollar
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime bluesTake up thy cross and follow Me
I heard my Master say
I gave My life to ransom thee
Surrender your all today
Wherever He leads I'll go
Wherever He leads I'll go
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so
Wherever He leads I'll go
He drew me closer to His side
I sought His will to know
And in that will I now abide
Wherever He leads I'll go
Wherever He leads I'll go
Wherever He leads I'll go
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so
Wherever He leads I'll go
My heart, my life, my all I bring
To Christ who loves me so
He is my Master, Lord, and King
Wherever He leads I'll go
Wherever He leads I'll go
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so
Wherever He leads I'll go
Wherever He leads I'll goThe mansion that I've promised her is still a dream somewhere back in my mind
Someday she's gonna have it if I live that long if God give me the time
Although I haven't given her the things she might have gotten from another
Oh never once till she complains her faith in me remains the same
And I love her
The day when our first baby came we both cried and felt the pain together
I passed around the cheap cigars and braged a lot about our newborn daughter
Now she's growing up and she's a sweet and loving image of her mother
Who gives me strenght to make each day and says I know you'll find the way
And I love her
When the world is walked away she's the one who always stays beside me
Giving all the love she can reaching out with gentle hands to guide me
In another month or two we hope to give our little girl a brother
Without her I could never be the kind of man she sees in me
And I love her and I love her[ Ira Alen ]
In the silence of this darken room my mind reels with a fragnance of your perfume
In your mind stormy thoughts are growing
Mhm I feel a cold cold wind a blowing woman I feel a cold cold wind a blowing
It's been a lifetime since I been close to you still no one really knows you like I do
With clouds in your mind and ray in your eyes a showing
Mhm I feel a cold cold wind a blowing woman I feel a cold cold wind a blowing
With my arms around you I hold you tight
Though you do the same to me girl you don't feel right
You've got a way of leavin' without going
Mhm I feel a cold cold wind a blowing woman I feel a cold cold wind a blowingI want to be a worker I want to sing and pray
I never want to be a stumbling block along the way
But in the hour of living so many people say
They all have all the answers but they all have different ways
But we can sing glory hallelujah brother we can sing
If we put our hearts together and we pray
No one really has to tell us what to say maybe we can really find the way
Well I hope it comes together instead of all apart
'Cause the better things of living are written in our hearts
But on the stage this morning the trouble is the star
Happiness is measured by houses and our cars
But we can sing glory hallelujah...
But we can sing glory hallelujah...Getting used to loving you won't be easy
For the last love I had was untrue
So go slow please go slow won't you darling
While I'm gettin' used to loving you
Getting used to loving you
Getting used to loving you
While I'm getting used to loving you
Getting used to kissing you won't be easy
For the last lips I kissed made me blue
So be sure please be sure you don't hurt me
While I'm gettin' used to loving you
Getting used to loving you...She was pretty and she laughed a lot Lord knows these days I need some laughter
So I called her up and I took her out she never dreamed what I was after
I wanted her lips I wanted her bad I wanted her love to clear my head
I wanted her to make me forget you but instead she made me remember
She looked at me with the softest eyes and spoke to me in a gentle whisper
And her body felt like it was gonna melt when I held her close and kissed her
I wanted her lips...
All the nights that I spent dyin' in your arms she made me remember
As she slowly drew up a pattern on my back with a soft side of her finger so tender
I wanted her lips...
I guess I'll always be in love with you she made me remember(Dolly Parton)
A little white house with black wooden shadows
A porch with its columns all covered with vine
My broken dream house where he lives with another
But this was supposed to be mine
Two little children that look like their daddy
With the same smile and the same eyes that shine
The only thing wrong I'm not their mommy
But they were supposed to be mine
He's given to her what he promised to me
The plans that we made never can be
For each night he holds and carresses another
And she is supposed to be me
He's given to her what he promised to me
The plans that we made never can be
For each night he holds and carresses another
And she is supposed to be meOn that first day of March the day that she was born
Wild as the wind was on the Friday morn
They all say that she looked evil even then
When her daddy smiled and said that she looked wild as the wind
The fourteen summers passed and she blossomed like a flower
Wild as the wind she grew prettier by the hour
Then one day she found out she could break the minds of men
She became a woman child wild as the wind
Lips as sweet as honey and so eager to please
She comes and she goes just like a summer breeze
I've been beneath her magic spell I know I'll go again
Gotta have that woman child wild as the wind
Gotta have that woman child wild as the wind
Gotta have that woman child wild as the windNever know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever, when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever, when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago
Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet, she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, "Julie, baby, you're my flame"
Thou givest fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm afire
Fever, yeah, I burn for sooth
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, "Daddy, oh, don't you dare"
"He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses
Daddy, won't you treat him right", go
Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever, if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

Sing I could sing all night
Let's all sing I could sing sing sing all night...
Everybody I could sing sing sing all night...He falls right outta the blue
Any old time
That he wants to
Can't seem
To catch him
But I try
Never know how long he'll stay
A couple of hours
Or a couple of days
He floods my heart
And leaves it desert-dry
He comes on strong
And then he's gone
He's like the rain
A beautiful storm
That washes me
Away
And I could move on
But I just sit and wait
For better weather
When everybody says he'll never change
'Cause he's like the rain
About the time the sun comes out
I find myself lookin' for clouds
Where's he now?
And when's he comin back?
When he's here
The thunder rolls
Lightnin flashes
And the wind blows
And no clear blue sky
Can move me quite like that
And no flower grows
On sunshine alone
He's like the rain
A beautiful storm
That washes me
Away
And I could move on
But I just sit and wait
For better weather
When everybody says he'll never change
'Cause he's like the rain
A beautiful storm
That washes me
Away
And I could move on
But I just sit and wait
For better weather
When everybody says he'll never change
'Cause he's like the rainIT'S BEEN A LONG, LONG TIME
Writers Sammy Cahn, Jule Styne
Kiss me once, then kiss me twice Then kiss me once again. It's been a long, long time. Haven't felt like this, my dear Since I can't remember when. It's been a long, long time You'll never know how many dreams I've dreamed about you. Or just how empty they all seemed without you. So kiss me once, then kiss me twice Then kiss me once again. It's been a long, long time. Ah, kiss me once, then kiss me twice Then kiss me once again. It's been a long time. Haven't felt like this my dear Since I can't remember when It's been a long, long time. ****** As recorded by Louis Armstrong: Kiss me once, and kiss me twice Then kiss me once again It's been a long, long time Haven't felt like this, my dear Since I can't remember when It's been a long, long time You'll never know how many dreams I've dreamed about you Or just how empty they all seemed without you So kiss me once, then kiss me twice Then kiss me once again It's been a long, long time (Instrumental Break) Oh, kiss me once, and kiss me twice Then kiss me once again It's been a long, such a long time I haven't felt like this my dear Since I don't remember when It's been a long, been a mighty long time You'll never know how many dreams I've dreamed about you Or how empty they all seem without you So kiss me once, and kiss me twice And kiss me once again It's been a long, long time It's been a mighty, mighty long timeOh the desert dreams of a river
That will run down to the sea
Like my heart longs for an ocean
To wash down over me
Oh won't you take me from this valley
To that mountain high above
Oh I will pray, pray, pray till I see your smiling face
I will pray, pray, pray to the one that I love
Oh the outcast dreams of acceptance
Just to find pure love's embrace
Like an orphan longs for its mother
May you hold me in your grace
Oh won't you take me from this valley
To that mountain high above
Oh I will pray, pray, pray till I see your smiling face
I will pray, pray, pray to the one that I love
Ooh, whoa oh, whoa oh oh
Ooh, whoa oh, whoa oh oh
Oh the caged bird dreams of a strong wind
That will flow beneath her wings
Like a voice longs for a melody
Oh Jesus, carry me
Oh won't you take me from this valley
To that mountain high above
Oh I will pray, pray, pray till I see your smiling face
I will pray, pray, pray to the one that I love
Oh I will pray, pray, pray till I see your smiling face
I will pray, pray, pray to the one that I loveWhen I was ten years old
I remember thinking how cool it would be
When we were going on an eight-hour drive
If I could just watch TV
And I'd have given anything
To have my own Pac-Man game at home
I used to have to get a ride down to the arcade
Now I've got it on my phone
Hey, glory, glory, hallelujah
Welcome to the future
My grandpa was in World War 2
He fought against the Japanese
He wrote a hundred letters to my grandma
Mailed them from his base in the Philippines
I wish they could see this now
The world they saved has changed you know
'Cause I was on a video chat this morning
With a company in Tokyo
Hey, everyday's a revolution
Welcome to the future
Hey, look around it's all so clear
Hey, wherever we were going, well we're here
Hey, so many things I never thought I'd see
Happening right in front of me
I had a friend in school
Running back on the football team
They burned a cross in his front yard
For asking out the homecoming queen
I thought about him today
And everybody who'd seen what he'd seen
From a woman on a bus
To a man with a dream
Hey, wake up Martin Luther
Welcome to the future
Hey, glory, glory, hallelujah
Welcome to the futureJohn come home all in a wonder,
Rattled at the door just like thunder.
"Who is that?" Mister Hendley cried,
"It is my husband! You must hide!"
She held the door till old man Hendley
Jumping and jerking went up the chimney.
John come in, looked all around,
But not a soul could be found.
John sat down by the fireside weeping,
Up the chimney he got to peeping.
There he saw the poor old soul
Sittin' a-straddle of the pot-rack pole.
John built on a rousing fire
Just to suit his own desire.
His wife called out with a free good will,
"Don't do that, for the man you'll kill!"
John reached up and down he fetched him
Like a racoon dog he catched him.
He blacked his eyes and then he did better:
He kicked him out upon his setter.
His wife she crawled in under the bed,
He pulled her out by the hair of the head.
" When I'm gone, remember this!"
And he kicked her where the kicking is best.
The law came down and John went up,
He didn't have the chance of a yellow pup,
Sent him down to the old chain gang
For beating his wife, the dear little thing.
When he got off, he went back to court,
His wife she got him for non-support.
John didn't worry and John didn't cry
But when he got close, he socked her in the eye.
Took John back to the old town jail
His wife she come and paid his bail.
Won't be long till he'll be loose --
I could tell more about it but there ain't no use.Written by billy burnette and larry henley.
Gone again somebody help me i'm
Sinkin' in
Deeper this time than I've ever been
Ooh baby I'm gone again
Well I promised myself a million times
Nobody else gonna mess up my mind
Don't ask me how it happened 'cause i
Don't know
You must have slipped up on me through
My back door
I don't know
I'm gone again, somebody help me i'm
Sinkin' in
Deeper this time than I've ever been
Ooh baby I'm gone again
Well I'm goin' goin' gone so long babe
I'm gone againWindow seat
30,000 feet
Above the ground
Blue moon beams on silver wings
Brings me down
Slipping off my coat for the long night flight
I finda note she wrote last night
I can almost hear those words
As I close my eyes:
Goodnight Sweetheart sleep tight
Where ever you are
God hold you in his arms
While we're apart
Though you're far away
Your love will stay
Tucked away here in my heart
Goodnight, sweetheart, sleep tight
Where ever you are
These days I leave
The one who needs me
More and more it seems
It's a high price that she pays
For the dreams I dream
Goodnight Sweetheart sleep tight
Where ever you are
God hold you in his arms
While we're apart
Though you're far away
Your love will stay
Tucked away here in my heart
Goodnight, sweetheart, sleep tight
Where ever you areWandering mind wandering mind
Wondering where you are and how you spend your time
Wondering if you're wondering bout the one you left behind
My heart is weak but my mind's a little bit stronger
I keep a tellin' myself everyday in my life
But the strain of losin' you has overloaded my mind
Leavin' thoughts of you workin' over time
Wandering mind...
My mind weaks up each day a little bit sooner
To start each day a wandering right on time
But each day ends with my questions still unanswered
Of why you left me here with a wandering mind
Wandering mind...
Wandering mind...You got a lock on your heart, it's chained in the dark
Somehow you lost the key
You said you tried everything to get love back again
But baby you ain't tried me
Bet I could break on through
If you want me to
Tell me what it takes to put a smile on your face
And leave your lonely days behind
I can take it from there, get you floatin' on air
Girl, if you just give me a sign
That you want me to
Do you want me to?
My heart's skippin' like a stone on the water
Tell me what do I gotta do
To make you want me too
The way I feel, couldn't fall any farther
Help me, what do I gotta do
To make you want me
To make you want me
To make you want me too
Out of all the million things that I might dream for
I can only think of one
And it's me and you sailin' under the blue
Underneath the golden sun
All I want is you
Do you want me too?
My heart's skippin' like a stone on the water
Tell me what do I gotta do
To make you want me too
The way I feel, couldn't fall any farther
Help me, what do I gotta do
To make you want me
To make you want me
To make you want me too
My heart's skippin' like a stone on the water
Tell me what do I gotta do
To make you want me too
The way I feel, couldn't fall any farther
Help me, what do I gotta do
To make you want me
To make you want me
To make you want me tooI'm going down this lonesome road
To see my fate or victory
God must help us there to win
I'm coming back but I don't know when
I hate to leave my mother dear
My father who is old and gray
But my true love I know you'll wait
For me to come back to me to stay
Will you be here when I come home
Or will your love fade like a rose
I could never come back should you be gone
My love for you nobody knowsIt's been so long, darling since I had to go away
It's been so long, darling and I'll never forget that day
Although you never mentioned it
You cried that whole day long
It's been so long, darling but now I'm comin' home
It's been so long, darling since I gazed into your eyes
It's been so long, darling, do you really realize?
That just the thought of seein' you
It scares me through an' through
It's been so long, darling since I had a kiss from you
It's been so long, darling but it won't be long now
It's been so long, darling but I've kept every vow
I pray that you'll be waitin'
As you did in days gone by
It's been so long, darling, please don't blame me if I cry
It's been so long, darling since I gazed into your eyes
It's been so long, darling, do you really realize?
That just the thought of seein' you
It scares me through an' through
It's been so long, darling since I had a kiss from youWriter: Reece D. WIlson
The game was tied at seven all
She said let's take a walk
We found a place behind the stands
She said we need to talk
She went on and on about this town bein' small
And how she needed other things
Just about when they made it 7 to 10
She gave me back my ring
Cheers went up as she broke down
She said it isn't you
I think you know how I really feel
But there's things I need to do
She said somethin' about some school down south
Where she was gonna go next fall
14 to 10 we were winnin' again
While I was losin' it all
She lookd at me with tear filled eyes
And said I hope you realize
That this is not the way that I meant for it end
And suddenly the crowd broke through
Yellin' we've got spirit how about you
And all that I could think to do was simply join in
She said its best if we do this now
Then it began to rain
I wasn't sure if I was shakin'
From the cold or the pain
She turned away then she stopped to say
She really hoped I understood
I nodded my head as the loud speaker said
The kick is up it's good
I waited til she walked back in
Then turned my back into the wind
Before I let the tears begin to fall with the rain
I made it back in time to see
Jason throw to Bobby Lee
And make homecoming history
With a ninety yard gain
Now there's a banner hangin' down
From the stadium wall
Reminding everybody of the year we won it all
And though I was at every game I swear
One remains a memory
It was 21 -17 when time ran out on meHear the lonesome whippoorwill
His song's too blue to fly
The midnight train is a-winding low
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I've never seen a night so long
When time keeps crawling by
The moon is gone behind the clouds
To hide his face and cry
Have you ever seen a robin weep
When leaves have turned to brown?
Like me he's lost his will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple haze
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cryBuddy I'm sick of shootin' at clay
Dreaming of opening day, how 'bout you?
Yeah me too
The only thing I want to do is hunt with you
Kill a bird or two go get your gun
Let's shoot dove all day long until all our shells are gone
Shoot five times then reload
Run like heck if the game warden shows
Yeah when the sun comes up let's shoot dove
You know Faith gets mad at me when she thinks I'd rather be
In a field with you sippin' brews, shootin' anythin' that moves
I think my sight's a little off to the right, you can't hit nothing
Let's shoot dove all day long until our eardrums are blown
By tonight one things for sure
Boy our shoulders will be sore
I just can't get enough let's shoot dove
Let's shoot dove all day long until all our shells are gone
Point your gun towards the sky
I want to see them feathers fly
And when the sun comes up I just can't get enough let's shoot dove
Hey do you get one?
Nah do you?
Yeah I think I winged oneI woke up this morning smelling like lemons
Salt on the back of my hands
Mouth was so dry
I couldn't even spit My eyes felt
like they were full of sand
I called Troy Jenkins to see if he survived
My head pounding like a stone
He started reeling off things I did last night
And I cried out over the phone
I did what? I smooched who?
Oh tell me the boss wasn't there
And that I caused quite a scene
When I stripped off my jeans
And did a slide in my underwear
I did what? I mooned who?
Oh this time I guess I crossed the line
There'll be hell to pay
But what can I say
I must've had a real good time
Troy laughed and said some guy named Red's
Been looking for you all night
And oh by the way his girl said to say
"Just come back any old time"
Then he went down the list of the things I'd done
As I listened in misery I was thinking real hard
about leaving town And changing my identity
Chores
What can I say I had a bad day
I guess I just lost my mind
It's all just a blur
But one things for sure
I must've had a real good timeThere's a long line of mourners driving down our little street
Their fancy cars are such a sight to see, oh, yeah
They're all of your rich friends who knew you in the city
And now they've finally brought, brought you home to me
When you left you know you told me that some day you'd be returnin'
In a fancy car all the town to see, oh, yeah
Well, now everyone is watching you, you finally had your dream
Yeah, and you're ridin' in a long black limousine
You know the papers told of how you lost your life, oh, yeah
The party, the party and the fatal crash that night
Well, the race upon the highway, oh, the curve you didn't see
When you're riding in that long black limousine
You're riding in that long black limousine
Through tear filled eyes I watch as you ride by, oh, yeah
A chauffeur, a chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine
Well, I never, I never, never, never, oh, my heart, all my dreams
Yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
Yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
Yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousineThe week was long, but now it's gone
The drink is on
So fill your cup and turn the good time music up

And get a little lost in the party
Flow you the trouble like a champagne bubble, sayin'
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

For a place to park it to their life
Two shots of Patron, don't wanna go home
2Am in the morning, just you and I
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Just bumpin' the night)
Two bottles of Bud (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the nightBetty Lonely lives in a duplex of stucco on the north bank of a brackish river
Her ears omit the noise from a nearby airstrip her mind floats beyond the snapper boats
Betty Lonely, her green eyes are roughly staring at a point through the sliding glass door
Her heart lives over a drawbridge
Her brain is wet like a throw net
Betty Lonely, she will always think in Spanish
Though I know her Spanish black hair
It will start to fade she sunk her past
Out in the surrounding salt flats
Her maidenhood was lost beneath the Spanish mossDon't tell her what it's worth, third rock from her thumb
Well, he walks in the pawn shop, one thing on his mind
Wants to buy a diamond but he doesn't have a dime
He finds the one he likes and they cut him quite a deal
A two carat solitaire but neither one's real
Picks up the pay phone, puts it to his ear
Calls his chick, collect and says, "Get over here"
When he shows his girlfriend, she can't believe her eyes
She never thought she'd ever really get one that size
He tries to think of somethin' when she asked him "where'd you get it?"
Down at diffie's pawn but he never will admit it
He tries to change the subject, "Forget the wedding list
Let's head on out to Vegas and get it over with"
Flaws and defects, no billing ads
Hope she never finds out how much he spent
Nothin' else shines like a zirconia
Don't tell her what it's worth, third rock from her thumb
Just outside of Vegas, the truck gets a flat
She says, "We woulda made it if you weren't so doggone fat"
They try to hitch a ride from some hippies in a van
To a ratty little motel called 'The S and M grand'
Puts on her little nightie, gives him a little wink
Ring slips off her finger, down the bathroom sink
She starts to call a plumber, he begins to shout
"Give me a coat-hangar, I think I can get it out"
Fishes out the ring in a big ball of hair
Slips it on her finger as he pats her derriere
Thinkin' to himself, "It's a lucky thing
A plumber woulda cost me much more than that ring"
Flaws and defects, no billing ads
Hope she never finds out how much he spent
Nothin' else shines like a zirconia
Don't tell her what it's worth, third rock from her thumb
Flaws and defects, no billing ads
Hope she never finds out how much I spent
Nothin' else shines like a zirconia
Don't tell her what it's worth, third rock from her thumb
Wonder what it's worth, third rock from her thumb
Don't tell him what it's worth, third rock from her thumbThe sun reflected on a passing car
Flashed like a signal or a star
I saw myself die under an on coming semi
Wanting to say I love planet earth
One road goes through the reservation
With one casino and one gas station
Rusted VW bug upside down
By the side of the road
Wanting to say I love planet earth
Acres of golden hills before us
Turn blue and lavender too
In the rear view mirror
If I was a hawk I'd circle the mountains
Set sail moon over Oklahoma
Spindly trees lead you to New Orleans
Wanting to say I love planet earth
Majestic red rocks stand like walls
Black clouds like fists beat the sky
God help us all
If I was the land I'd wear my hair down
If I was the sea I'd follow the sun
If I was the sky I'd open my arms
Wanting to say I love planet earthI wear a greasy ball cap
I like my shirt un-tucked
I spend Saturdays working on my truck
I don't like to fight
But I ain't scared to bleed
Most don't mess with a guy like me
'Cause guys like me drink too many beers on Friday after work
Our best blue jeans have Skoal rings
We wear our boots to church
So rough around the edges
It's hard to believe that girls like you
Love guys like me
Your daddy worked at the bank
Mine worked on cars
You went to college
I pulled graveyard
You must have had your pick
Of all the trust fund types
But you came back to me and only God knows why
'Cause guys like me drink too many beers on Friday after work
Our best blue jeans have Skoal rings
We wear our boots to church
So rough around the edges
It's hard to believe that girls like you
Love guys like me
Now there's a lot of guys like me out there
In a lot of little towns
And tellin' all our buddies we won't ever settle down
We say that's just the way we are, and the way we'll always be
So God sends girls like you for guys like me
Thank God there's girls like you for guys like meWe got a bucket of Corona,
Enough stories to last all night,
About the trials and tribulations,
Of findin' Mr. Right:
Of findin' a good man.
Here's to the liars and the cheaters and the cold mistreaters;
To the Momma's boys who can't make a stand.
Here's to the superficial players;
The "I love ya" too-soon-sayers;
If you hear me girls, raise your hand:
Let's have a toast:
Here's to findin' a good man.
Blind dates an' horror stories;
Pushy gals and fast movers.
Let's dedicate this girl's night out,
To big-talkers; bad losers,
It's so hard findin' a good man.
Here's to the liars and the cheaters and the cold mistreaters;
To the Momma's boys who can't make a stand.
Here's to the superficial players;
The "I love ya" too-soon-sayers;
If you hear me girls, raise your hand:
Let's have a toast:
Here's to findin' a good man.
Julie, I know you want perfection;
Angie, you want a listener.
Lisa, your list is gettin' long,
And girls, you know me:I just want a good kisser.
Here's to the liars and the cheaters and the cold mistreaters;
To the Momma's boys who can't make a stand.
Here's to the superficial players;
The "I love ya" too-soon-sayers;
If you hear me girls, raise your hand:
Let's have a toast;
Let's have a toast:
Here's to findin' a good man.
Here's to findin' a good man.
Here's to findin' a good man.THE TWELFTH OF NEVER
WITH KEITH URBAN
WRITERS JERRY LIVINGSTON, PAUL FRANCIS WEBSTER
You ask me how much I need you, must I explain? I need you, oh my darling, like roses need rain You ask how long I'll love you, I'll tell you true Until the Twelfth of Never, I'll still be loving you Hold me close, never let me go Hold me close, melt my heart like April snow I'll love you 'til the bluebells forget to bloom I'll love you 'til the clover has lost its perfume I'll love you 'til the poets run out of rhyme Until the Twelfth of Never and that's a long, long time Until the Twelfth of Never and that's a long, long timeLonesome Road Blues
I walked on down that lonesome line
Hung my head and I cried
I wept and I cried under a willow tree
Out by the deep blue sea
My mama, my dear papa can be found,
And my brother on a county road
Now I been down that long plank walk,
I?m on my way back home
You cause me to weep, you do cause me to moan
You cause me to leave my home
I cried last night and the night before
I swear I won?t cry anymore
Your fast mail train comin round that track
Killed my brown eyed boy
They took him down that smokey track
Brought him back on a cooling board
Now I?m lookin down that lonesome line
Just as far as I care to see
I have no money lost my brown eyed boy
These blues won?t set me free[C] There's A Fam'ly [F] Bible on the [C] table
Each [Am] page is torn and [D] hard to [G7] read
But [C] The Fam'ly [F] Bible on the [C] table
Will [F] ever be my [C] key to [G] memo-[C] ries.
[C] At the close of [F] day when work was [C] over
And [Am] when the evening [D] meal was [G7] done
Dad would [C] read to us [F] from The Fam'ly [C] Bible
And we'd [F] count our many [C] blessings [G7] one by [C] one.
Refrain:
I can [F] see us [Bb] sittin' 'round the [F] table
When from The Fam'ly Bible Dad would [C] read
(1) I can hear my [F] mother softly [C] singing
(2) I can hear my [F] mama softly [C] singing
Rock of Ages, [F] Rock of [C] Ages [G7] cleft for [C] me.
This old world of ours is full of troubles
But this world would oh, so better be
If we'd find more Bibles on the table
And mothers singing Rock of Ages cleft for me.I walked out to the graveyard
Down by the Church of God
I looked upon the one I love
That would soon be covered with sod
Up along the Ohio river
Over on the old Kentucky shore
Once dwelled a fair young maiden
Now there's a crepe upon her door
The angels took my darling
God needed the one I loved
I reached the old Kentucky shore today
I'll make my plans and meet her up above
The last words that my darling said
Was tell the one I love goodbye
I would like to see him before I go
But I'll meet him in the skyOh holy night! The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth!
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appear'd and the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!
Fall on your knees Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine Oh night divine
Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men from Orient land
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend.
Fall on your knees Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine Oh night Oh night divine
Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall he break for the slave is our brother
And in His name, all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise
We let all within us praise His holy name
Fall on your knees Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine Oh night Oh night divineNow I'm only five years old
I've got to do just what I'm told
Santa Claus is gonna be dropping in on me
Is there something I might have missed?
I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can fit it all under that Christmas tree
Now I know what he likes for a late night snack
For years now it's been bringing him back
Milk and cookies
He'll come and go without a sound again
But how in the world does he get in
Ain't got a chimney
Close my eyes and concentrate
Try to sleep, it's getting late
All night long I lie awake
Till Santa's gone I just can't wait
Now could there something I might have missed?
I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can fit it all under that Christmas tree
Sneak a peek down the hall
I've got to check now, I don't recall
The milk and cookies
I think I'm sure I got it all
The stocking's hung along the wall
Ain't got a chimney
Close my eyes and concentrate
I gotta sleep now, it's getting late
All night long I lie awake
Till Santa's gone I just can't wait
I just can't wait, I just can't wait
Could there be something I might have missed?
I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can fit it all under that Christmas tree
I hope he can fit it all under my Christmas tree
[Incomprehensible]
Hid a guitar under there, cowboy hat, bicycle maybe
Don't know what he's gonna do with that horseMy older brother Tommy was a lineman rest his soul
His job was hanging hot wire on them high-line power poles
Every morning bright and early he'd climb way up in the sky
And I never understood it so one day I asked him why
He said it pays big money and man I'm into that
It pays big money of you're willing to take a chance
Let me tell you something, sonny, you ought to see my bank account
It pays big money but he sure can't spend it now
Well, my late uncle Charlie was this demolition hound
He'd travel across the country blowing buildings to the ground
He carried a case of dynamite seemed everywhere he went
He smoked them big long cigars and he'd wink at you and grin
He said it pays big money and man I'm into that
It pays big money of you're willing to take a chance
Let me tell you something, sonny, you ought to see my bank account
It pays big money but he sure can't spend it now
Well, now the moral of this story, boys, is don't go getting yourself killed
Be nice to your rich relatives they just might put you in their will
That pays big money and we're all into that
It pays big money and big money's where it's at
Let me tell you something, sonny, you ought to see my bank account
It pays big money and we're rolling in it now
It pays big money having foolish kin
It pays big money, guess I owe it all to them
Let me show you something, sonny, take a look at this bank account
It pays big money let's all spend some of it nowI got me in bed and covered my head
Wish I was dead with Sally Jo
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
Since you have gone my days are turned to night
Nothin' goes right Sally Jo
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
The hurt you left has just begun to show
Sally Jo I've been so low
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
I'm like a little dog left out to stray
No one wants me no place to stay
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
Did I do bad or was I good to you
Yes or no Sally Jo
Sally Jo where did you goSally Jo
The torch I carried had a light so bright
For me to see Sally Jo
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
Sally Jo Sally Jo
hear my plea come back to meCome live with me and be my love
Come fulfill the dreams my heart's dreaming of
While the turtle dove calls to the mist as April rain falls
Oh come live with me and be my love
Come take my hand and walk with me
Unafraid to face whatever may be
While the wild woods murmur with the sweetest wind songs of summer
Oh come live with me and be my love
And say to me autumn leaves turned to gold
Stay and hold me in your arms when the world is cold
Come stand with me and be my love
While the candle shine and bells ring above
And forsake me never could be my love forever
Oh come live with me and be my loveSometimes I want to throw my arms around you
And I tremble at the thought of giving in
Because I know how much it cost to love you
And I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you revives the sorrow
That wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow
But I'm so afraid of losing you again
If heaven were to hear my heart's confession
Wanting you would be my greatest sin
But I'm glad that you're no longer my possession
'Cause I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you...
Yes I'm so afraid of losing you againFrom a jack to a king from loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an ace and I won a queen and walked away with your heart
From a jack to a king with no regrets I stackled the cards last night
The Lady Luck played her hand just right to make me king of your heart
For just a little while I thought that I might lose again
Then just in time I saw the twinkle in your eye
From a jack to a king from loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an ace and I won a queen you make me King of your heart
For just a little while...Lying here beside her I've come to understand
If you want to be happy you can
It don't take living like a king, it doesn't cost you anything
All it takes is a woman and a man
Because its who you love and who loves you
Its not where you are if she's there too
It's not who you know or what you do
It's who you love and who loves you
This modern world we live in is a sad state of affairs
Everybody wants what isn't theirs
While the race for money and success in search of happiness
We turn out the light and go upstairs
Because its who you love and who loves you
Its not where you are if she's there too
It's not who you know or what you do
It's who you love and who loves you
So we hold each other tight
And own the world tonight
'Cause love is all that matters anyway
Because its who you love and who loves you
Its not where you are if she's there too
It's not who you know or what you do
It's who you love and who loves you
Its who you love and who loves you
Its not where you are if she's there too
It's not who you know or what you do
It's who you love and who loves you(Puttin' pain on paper crying in permanent blue)
When I began this letter I had hopes I wouldn't cry
But I always knew it would cause me more than a stamp to tell you goodbye
Puttin' pain on paper mailing all my hurt to you
Puttin' pain on paper crying in permanent blue
Now this pen lets me say the things I could never say to you
But these shaky lines would look as sad in any shade of blue
Puttin' pain on paper...
I'm glad this ink is permanent it proves I'm not all done
Cause if tears could wash these words away you wouldn't know who they're from
Puttin' pain on paper...
Crying in permanent blueLittle girl you stand out in the crowd
You're laughing and talking much too loud
But I see a little tear peaking through
It takes one to know one and I know you
It takes one to know one and I know you
The little tear through your smiles I see through
You've been hurt and your frightened you're so blue
It takes one to know one and I know you
Little girl please take hold of my hand
Just go right on and cry I'll understand
Pay no mind if start crying too
It takes one to know one and I know youBaby you're a wrecking ball
Crashing into me
Nothing I can do but fall
Piece by piece
You broke down every part of me
That ever thought I would never need you, baby
It's twisted
Messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I might never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you, even if it's wrong
Everybody's telling me
I'm over my head
But they don't feel you loving me
They all say
I've gone crazy
Maybe, but its too late to save me
I'm too tangled
It's twisted
Messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy but so what
I may never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you even if its wrong
Even if its twisted, yeah
Maybe its not right
But that's alright
Yeah, its alright tonight
It's twisted
Messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy but so what
I may never understand it
It's twisted
Messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy but so what
I may never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you even if its wrong
Even if its twisted
Even if its just a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little twisted yeah
It's twisted
YeahA light shines from my window
I just can't sleep no more
Lord, it hurts so much to be alone
But the real men never do admit
That it's them that might be wrong
At least that's what he told me in his song
He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didn't miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didn't shed a tear
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind
The freedom that he sings about
I guess I'll never know
I just can't shake the guilt or kill the pain
But he lets me ride when the lights turns low
Get on board the radio and take a ride to Texas on his train
He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didn't miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didn't shed a tear
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kindVERSE 1
I got drunk last night on a bottle of wine
I got to see some old friends, I havent seen in a really long time
Aint nothing changed, they still act all just the same
Just grown up kids, willing to do it all over again
CHORUS
Cause life aint nothing but a Merry Go Round
Pick up a bottle, and well pass it around
Life aint nothing but a merry go round
And it never, no it never, slows down
VERSE 2
Well, I get stoned some nights and I peel back the layers of life
Look into my soul to see if anybodys home, if theres any kind of light
To tell you the truth, I hate to be all alone by myself in the dark
I thought this life, was supposed to be a walk in the park
CHORUS
VERSE 3
The end of the road, is when they put you six feet in the ground
The only time in this life, you can ever get off of the merry go round
Ive been here for some thirty years now I know
Give me thirty more, I want to make a little more of this show
CHORUSThe sun goes down, it leaves me sad and blue
The iron curtain falls on this cold war with you
Though you won't speak and I won't speak, that's true
Two stubborn people with a cold war to go through
Oh why, oh why should love ever come
To couples like you and me
Whose cold, cold wars are never won
And whose hearts just can't be free?
Oh, let's do right or let's just say we're through
I just can't stand another cold cold war with you
Oh why, oh why should love?There was a time I really thought it did some good
To get down on my knees to you and I would
But baby now that's all changed today's a brand new day
And you ain't worth the price I pay to stay
Just because you're the best looking woman that I've ever seen
Ain't reason enough to have to treat you like a king
There's a harder lesson you needed to learn and it might as well be today
Baby you ain't worth the price I pay to stay
I'm tired of tryin' to turn the other cheek to you
And never knowin' which way to turn cause you've made up
A brand new set of rules
Somewhere I picked up a little more pride than I had yesterday
Baby you ain't worth the price I pay to stay
I'm tired of tryin' to turn
Ah baby you ain't worth the price I pay to stayI've been a waiter, a roofer, a clerk
I've shoveled manure till my pride hurt.
When you're starting out, it's all part of the work
To do what I do.
I've been evicted for not making rent
Made my Daddy wonder where my good sense went.
For the price of a dream, my years have been spent
To do what I do.
So I stand here tonight with this six string guitar
To be something I've always been in my heart.
Just for the chance to play you my song
The thrill when I hear you singing along.
It's been worth everything I've been through
To do what I do.
I've played for empty tables and chairs
The drunks that don't listen, the crowds that don't care.
Been told countless times Boy you ain't goin' nowhere
To do what I do.
So I hope the critics and skeptics alike
All bought a ticket to this show tonight.
And they'll see firsthand that I have survived
And what doesn't kill you makes you more alive.
And I'm one of the fortunate few
To do what I do.
There's so much joy this music can bring
So I count my blessings when I step up to sing.
Cause they're so many people who would give anything
To do what I do.
And I thank you.
I can do what I do!When you called me and said you had to see me
I thought you meant to start our life anew
But you told me you would wed tomorrow
And you just wanted one last rendezvous
Tonight is our last night together at dawn
Till tomorrow you'll be gone
But darling, this night would last forever
If I could hold back the dawn
When you walk down the aisle with him tomorrow
To take his name and whisper 'Dear, I do'
Will you be thinkin' of the future, darling
Or thinkin' of my last night with you
I wish you'd never mention your tomorrow
Darling, when you call me on the phone
But there wouldn't be a new tomorrow
If I could hold back the dawnThe honeymoon is over
The honeymoon is over
Back in the dance halls again
Back in the dance halls again
The kids are all so violent
The kids are all so violent
I'm a fool for the latest trends
I'm a fool for the latest trends
Robitussin and an 808
Slow dancing, with a stranger's date
Damn it feels good to be back again
Damn it feels good to be back again
The girls in strange attire
I really love Richard Pryor
I don't care about anything
Smooth jazz in the evening
In the room you made a mess
On the floor is a cocktail dress
I always thought I was born
To die young and blow a horn
A line of K and a diet Sprite
Take my hand, lets drift through this night
Damn it feels good to be back again
Damn it feels good to good
Damn it feels good to be back again
Damn it feels good to be backSomehow I'm not gettin' through to you
For you don't treat me like you used to do
I see a far away look in your eyes
And I'm afraid that we're saying goodbye
I had a bad bad dream last night
I dreamed that someone else
Was holding you tight
Another's arms were holdin' you
Another's lips were kissin' you
I had a bad bad dream last night
Oh I don't hardly know you anymore
For you don't act the same as before
Hold me close and whisper I love you
And that my bad bad dream won't come true
I had a bad bad dream last nightThe first sound I heard was a woman's cry
The first word I learned to utter was goodbye
Forgive me if I'm wrong in what I do to you
While passin' through passin' through
Happiness for me cannot be found but yet I still search from town to town
No offence but I don't think I'll find it here with you
Goodbye babe just passin' through
Passin' through your life like a ragin' river
No woman needs or can hold the love I give her
Please understand I can't control these things I do
While passin' through passin' through
What was that did you say you thought you loved me
That's too bad girl cause if you really do
You'll just awaken with the dawn and find your love has flown
Like an old wild goose passin' through
Passin' through your life like a ragin' river
Like a cold north wind jus a passin' through
Goodbye babe passin' throughNow we don't know what Heaven looks like,
But we've seen enough Hell... right here and right now
But when the road is the roughest,
And the problems are the toughest,
Or when the times are the hardest and that ol' sky turns the darkest,
You gotta keep the faith,
'Cause I believe there's a better day,
And those ol' blues, why there gonna just roll right on away,
I know they are, listen to me.
All this blue, ain't sky and sea,
Some of this blue's bound to get on me,
But the blues, don't come to stay,
They'll move away
On a better day.
Troubles and woes and misery,
Ain't gonna get the best of me,
Lift the shades, fix my gaze,
On a better day
Clear the way
Better days, just up ahead
When sorrow ain't sleepin' in my bed,
When people ain't messin' with my head,
There's a better way,
There's a brighter day,
Oohh there's a better day
With clearer skies
Hope and promise on the rise
Oh the future that is looking bright
On a better day look away, look away
(interlude)
ohh ohh woahh ohh hmmm mmm hmmm
There's a better day
Oh better days, just up ahead
When sorrow ain't sleepin' in my bed,
And people ain't a messin' with my head,
There's a better day,
There's a better day
All of this blue, it ain't sky and sea
some of that blue's gonna to fall on me.
Oh the future's looking bright
There's a better day, look away, look away
Mmmhmmm mmmYou can have a lot of friends and still feel alone
But there's a lot of hands
Trying to mold you 'cause they think they can
You're a band geek, you're popular
A broken heart or a heartbreaker
What do you do when you're in between?
How do you label a freak like me?
I'm a blackbird flying in a white fence town
Got a church pew heart and a rock-and-roll mouth
I'm a straight-A kid with a fake ID
Little somewhere in between
I'm a dark horse running where you can't run wild
Got a good girl soul with a fast lane smile
I'm a homecoming queen with a tattoo sleeve
A 501 Blue dream
What's the point of fitting in?
'Cause at some point, I know we've all been
Alien
Alien
I'm an open book full of mysteries
With a runaway heart on a settle-down street
I'm an outsider just looking in
Not a 1 or a 2 or a perfect 10
I'm a wildflower growing through the concrete
Always somewhere I shouldn't be
I'm a blackbird flying in a white fence town
Got a church pew heart and a rock-and-roll mouth
I'm a straight-A kid with a fake ID
Little somewhere in between
I'm a dark horse running where you can't run wild
Got a good girl soul with a fast lane smile
I'm a homecoming queen with a tattoo sleeve
A 501 Blue dream
What's the point of fitting in?
'Cause at some point, I know we've all been

Do you ever feel like you were born
In the wrong place, in the wrong time
But there ain't nothing wrong with living your life?
Alien
Yeah, I'm a blackbird flying in a white fence town
Got a church pew heart and a rock-and-roll mouth
I'm a straight-A kid with a fake ID
Little somewhere in between
I'm a dark horse running where you can't run wild
Got a good girl soul with a fast lane smile
I'm a homecoming queen with a tattoo sleeve
A 501 Blue dream, oh
What's the point of fitting in?
'Cause at some point, I know we've all been
Alien
AlienYou came into my life at a time when I was down
And I thought I'd never love again but I think different now
You took my hand and helped me up and I thank you for your precious love
And words cannot express the way I feel but is it real
Is it real this love that you have offered me so freely
You tell me that you love me but darling do you really
Don't make me love and lose again don't make me go through that again
I've known that hurt and I know how it feels oh is it real
Well you could mend my broken heart with love as sweet as yours
And I want to believe it's real but how can I be sure
And you could heal the hurt I've known with the love that you have shown
And all the needs you have I will fullfill but is it real
Is it real this love that you have...
Is it realMr. Bourbon and Coke laughs
At all of my jokes when he's drinking
Mr. Martini stares and he
Never shares what he's thinking.
Miss Sexy Red Wine tells me at closing time
That she'll phone me
Mr. Whiskey Shot Glass watches hookers
Walk past when he's lonely.
[Chorus]
I'm a bartender
I pour the drinkers
Laugh with the sinners
And cry with the saints
And even if they don't remember
I try to make their bar tender.
Mr. Never Does Tip says
That none of his kids ever call home
Mrs. Chews On Her Lip tells someone
She's at work on her cell phone.
Mrs. Husband Just Died always
Breaks down and cries on the weekends
Just another long night in a
Bartender's life with some good friends.
I'm a bartender
I pour the drinkers
Laugh with the sinners
And cry with the saints
And even if they don't remember
I try to make their bar tender.
And even if they don't remember
I try to make their bar tenderI took road and said goodbye
Friends go one way, I went mine
I got lost then very quickly
Started shaking, feeling sickly
In the lion lair, in the lion lair
Watch your own self and take care
I am outside, almost one
With all the life in the lion lair
All alone and all around
Canyon clept above the ground
There was treeless flat around me
And no evil came and found me
In the lion lair, in the lion lair
Watch your own self and take care
I am outside, almost one
With all the life in the lion lair
Stars came out in midday burning
Earth grumbled stones were churning
Colors red were rocks and sky
And powered glint infused the eye
Had himself in no time
Hand on shaft and gripped his ball
Wished your mouth would come down on it
Feel your lips sink warm upon it
In the lion lair, in the lion lair
Watch your own self and take care
I am outside, almost one
With all the life in the lion lair
Beast and bird they called me kin
Bathed me and they tucked me in
Laid down on the forest ground
Stars above, they shone on down
In the lion lair, in the lion lair
Watch your own self and take care
I am outside, almost one
With all the life in the lion lair
In the lion lair, in the lion lair
Watch your own self and take care
I am outside, almost one
With all the life in the lion lairPeople say she's only in my head
It's gonna take time but I'll forget
They say I need to get on with my life
But they don't realize
Is when your dialing six numbers just to hang up the phone.
Driving cross town just to see if she's home.
Waking a friend in the dead of night, just to hear 'em say it's gonna be alright.
When your finding things to do not to fall asleep
'Cause you know she'll be there in your dreams.
That's when she's
More than a memory
Took a match to everything she ever wrote
Watched her words go up in smoke
Tore all the pictures off the wall
But that ain't helping me at all.
'Cause when your talking out loud and nobody's there
You look like hell and you just don't care
Drinking more than you've ever drank
Sinking down lower than you've ever sank
When you find yourself falling down upon your knees,
Praying to God, begging him please
That's when she's
More than a memory
She's more
She's more
'Cause when your dialing her number just to hang up the phone
Driving cross town just to see if she's home
Waking a friend in the dead of night, just to hear 'em say it's gonna be alright
When our finding things to do not to fall asleep
'Cause you know she'll be waiting in your dreams
That's when she's
More than a memory
People say she's only in my head
Its gonna take time but I'll forgetI tried to give up on love
'Cause I knew I should
No matter how hard I tried
It didn't do me no good
I just stopped cold turkey
What else could I do
There were pieces of my heart all over town
And I was runnin' out of blue
I was feelin' okay
When I got out of bed
But what I saw outside my window
Was like a kick in the head
My hands started shakin'
I felt the cold chills begin
When I saw that truck pull up
Now look who's movin' in
He lives twelve steps down
In the apartment below
He's got what it takes to tempt a woman
Body and soul
And if I fall I ain't got far to go
Slidin' around
I'm losin' ground
He lives twelve steps down
I tried to get a better look
So I sneaked downstairs
And just three steps from the bottom
I saw him standing there
Ain't it just my luck
He says he wants to be my friend
He set two glasses on the table
Now he's invitin' me in
And he lives twelve steps down
In the apartment below
He's got what it takes to tempt a woman
Body and soul
And if I fall I ain't got far to go
Slidin' around
I'm losin' ground
He lives twelve steps down
He lives twelve steps down
In the apartment below
He's got what it takes to tempt a woman
Body and soul
And if I fall I ain't got far to go
Slidin' around
I'm losin' ground
He lives twelve steps down
Slidin' around
I'm losin' ground
He lives twelve steps down
Twelve steps downRidin 'round the county drinkin from a jar. Big blue canoe up on top of the car. Hop in darlin', don't be a stranger. Sit back and relax, cause you ain't in no danger.
Well Bogalusa spells trouble to me, I'd rather stay out here under the trees. With the wind on the lake, the stars in the sky, what else do you need to make you feel high?
Chorus: I want to ride with you in my blue canoe. Baby lets go ridin. slippin and a sliding. In my blue canoe.
You bring the ice chest and I'll get the bait. Meet me at the lake and don't be late. Cause all this hangin around, is draggin me down. I gotta get behind the wheel and get the hell out of town. Too many people, too many cars, to many nights in too many bars. My noggin's gettin' soggy and my spirit's are saggin. Time to take a ride in my blue water wagon.There's a land that is fairer than day
And by faith we can see it afar
For the Father waits over the way
To prepare us a dwelling place there
[Chorus:]
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blessed
And our spirit shall sorrow no more
Not a sign for the blessing of rest
[Chorus x 2]The divorce had been granted and my wife was seeking the custody of our only son
And as our boy told his story we both started crying
Then I realized the harm we had done
He said your honor I'm seven and home was a heaven
My dad was a king in my eyes
My mother an angel who guided my footsteps and home was my one paradise
But I love them both and I can't choose just one
Dear judge can't you make them see
That mom without daddy or dad without mommy
Would only mean heartbreak to me
[ steel ]
Judge I'm so broken hearted my parents have parted
And gone are the dreams I once had
To me there's no other can be like my mother but I still want to be with my dad
But I love them both...I am just a poor boy though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my existence
On a pocket full of mumbles such are promises
All lies in jest, till a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest
Well I left my home and family I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station runnin' scared
Layin' low seeking out the poor quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know
Li li li
Li li li, li li li li
Li li li
Li li li, li li li li

Only seeking workman's wages I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there
In a-laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was home
Going home
Where the New York City winters aren't a-bleeding me
Bleeding me
Going home
Da da, da da da, da
Da da da da, da da da da, da da
Da da da da da
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every bloke that laid him down or cleft him
Till he cried out in his anger and his shame
I am leaving, I am leaving
But the fighter still remains

So pack your things and let's be on our way
This is not the world I promised not this shack so cold and grey
But I'll find it or keep on tryin' on my dyin' day
So I'll keep on tryin' for you my golden haired girl
For after all I promised you the world
You're the sweetest kind of a good girl you stop by me
You help me search for all my fancy dreams
But this place it looks no better than the last so we won't stay
But I'll find it or keep on tryin' on my dyin' day
Yes I'll keep on tryin' for you...
At last in finer way we have made it a house the yacht and toys and everything
And daddy loves you so much honey and you know mama looked at you the same way
And I promised her I'll keep tryin' and daddy's gonna keep tryin' until my dyin' day
Yes I'll keep on tryin' for you...Another day
I spend alone
Here lately
I cry and moan
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember
Early mornin's
I just suffer through Since feelin' empty's
What I'm bound to do
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember
When every choice filled with regret Even though they haven't yet
Make her thoughts surrender
Then she'll remember
Late afternoon
I curl up tight To fight back tears I'll shed all night
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember
Be no debatin' right or wrong
It's just a matter of how long
Those lies degend her
Then she'll remember
She'll try she'll try
But there won't be
No more escape
From her own lonely memories
Mine may be
The only scars that show
From every break
One heart could know
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember
Once all that's left is what's been used
And any chance to hide from the truth
Keeps gettin' slimmer
Then she'll remember
So, one more day
I'll spend alone
Like every other
I cry and moan
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember
The early mornin's
Late afternoons
Each empty night
I'm still sufferin' through
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember
When every choice filled with regret
Even though they haven't yet
Make her thoughts surrender
Then she'll rememberTake my advice if you want all the boys
To treat you nice you better act like
You can take em or leave em
When its cold outside and they knock at your door
Just look through the window and ask em what they came for

Cause people are funny and they dont know what they want when they have it
Its only things they dont know that they can believe in
Yeah, just take em or leave em
Aah uuhuhh, just take em or leave em
Well I was in love with a cute little boy
One time in my life and he broke my heart in two
Its true
Well I saw him dressed the other day
He looked the other way and then I knew
Hed loved me too
Cause people are funny and they dont know what they want when they have it
Its only things they dont know that they can believe in
Yeah, just take em or leave em

SHE SAYS IT'S ALWAYS MUDDY AND IT RIDES SO ROUGH
AIN'T NO GRACEFUL WAY TO CLIMB UP IN A DRESS
YEAH, I'M ABOUT AS COUNTRY AS SHE GETS
I MIGHT GET HER ON THE LAKE TO FISH WITH ME
IF THE WATER'S SMOOTH AND THE SKY IS BLUE WITH A NICE COOL BREEZE
ANYTHING WE CATCH I'LL HAVE TO CLEAN MYSELF
CAUSE I'M ABOUT AS COUNTRY AS SHE GETS
BUT SHE'LL SLIP OFF A PAIR OF HEELS
WALK BAREFOOT ACROSS THE FIELD
CLIMB UP ON THE FENCE JUST TO BE NEAR ME
SOMETIMES I THINK A HORSE STILL SCARES HER HALF TO DEATH
I'M ABOUT AS COUNTRY AS SHE GETS
SHE LIKES BEING WITHIN SPENDING DISTANCE OF THE MALL
AND HAVING ENOUGH BARS TO MAKE A CELL PHONE CALL
PUT HER IN A CROWD SHE'S RIGHT IN HER ELEMENT
I'M ABOUT AS COUNTRY AS SHE GETSA DAISY A DAY
Writer Jud Strunk
He remembers the first time he met 'er He remembers the first thing she said He remembers the first time he held her And the night that she came to his bed He remembers her sweet way of singin' Honey has somethin' gone wrong? He remembers the fun and the teasin' And the reason he wrote 'er this song I'll give you a daisy a day, dear I'll give you a daisy a day I'll love you until the rivers run still And the four winds we know blow away They would walk down the street in the evenin' And for years I would see them go by And their love that was more than the clothes that they wore Could be seen in the gleam of their eye As a kid they would take me for candy And I loved to go taggin' along We'd hold hands while we walked to the corner And the old man would sing 'er his song I'll give you a daisy a day, dear I'll give you a daisy a day I'll love you until the rivers run still And the four winds we know blow away Now he walks down the street in the evenin' And he stops by the old candy store And I somehow believe he's believin' He's holdin' 'er hand like before For he feels all her love walkin' with him And he smiles at the things she might say Then the old man walks up to the hilltop And gives her a daisy a day I'll give you a daisy a day, dear I'll give you a daisy a day I'll love you until the rivers run still And the four winds we know blow awayThey packed up all his buckles and shipped his saddle to his dad
And by the way the house looked, she must have took it bad
The workers come on Monday to fix the door and patch the wall
They say she just went crazy the night she got the call
He was up in Wyoming and drew a bull no man could ride
He promised her he'd turn own well it turned out that he lied
And the dreams that they'd been living in the California sand
Died right there beside him in Cheyenne
They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne
They never found her body, just her diary by the bed
It told about the fight they had and the words that she had said
When he told her he was ridin' she said, 'Then I don't give a damn
If you never come back from Cheyenne?
They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne
Nobody can explain it, some say she's still alive
They'd even claim they've seen her on the shoreline late at night
And if you go down by the water, you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of CheyenneWell I know sometimes you find it hard
To understand just what we do out here
Well that bus rolls up at home
And I just disappear
And I sure don't like to leave you
Couldn't stand for you to think that I don't care
So I wrote this job description
Just to tell you what I do when I'm not there
I sleep eighty miles an hour
To the whining of a diesel down the interstate
Dreamin' 'bout my little girls
The easy chair that sits beside the fireplace
Then we shut her down in another town
Shower up and do just what we came to do
Sing for the people
Count the money and the miles back home to you
Well each night I take the stage
With a six-piece band and a guitar in my hand
Singin' songs about my life
All the good times and the bad
Then we say goodbye and we load it up
And head somewhere I've already been
Then I lay down in that double bed alone
And I thank the lord again
I sleep eighty miles an hour
To the whining of a diesel down the interstate
Dreamin' 'bout my little girls
The easy chair that sits beside the fireplace
Then we shut her down in another town
Shower up and do just what we came to do
Sing for the people
Count the money and the miles back home to you
Well I just sing for the people
Count the money and the miles back home to youWe've been together since way back when
Sometimes I never want to see you again
But I want you to know, after all these years
You're still the one I want whisperin' in my ear
You're still the one -- I want to talk to in bed
Still the one -- that turns my head
We're still having fun, and you're still the one
I looked at your face every day
But I never saw it 'til I went away
When winter came, I just wanted to go (wanted to go)
Deep in the desert, I longed for the snow
You're still the one -- that makes me laugh
Still the one -- that's my better half
We're still having fun, and you're still the one
You're still the one -- that makes me strong
Still the one -- I want to take along
We're still having fun, and you're still the one (yes you are)
Changing, our love is going gold
Even though we grow old, it grows new
You're still the one -- that I love to touch
Still the one -- and I can't get enough
We're still having fun, and you're still the one
You're still the one -- who can scratch my itch
Still the one -- and I wouldn't switch
We're still having fun, and you're still the one
You are still the one -- that makes me shout
Still the one -- that I dream about
We're still having fun, and you're still the one
You're still the one, yeah still the one
We're still having fun, and you're still the oneSweaty hands, quicksand,
I know I should, but I'm scared I can't
It's a big move, everything to lose
What if its nothing like the way I planned
What if, what if I fail
What if chasing my dreams is chasing my tail
Do I listen to the voice tellin me to stay
Or listen to the voice that's screaming out
Go, just go
Just go with your heart
Go with the flow
There's only one way you're ever gonna know
Go
This town, safe and sound
I already know my way around
I've got a few good friends
A few good men to buy me flowers and take me out
What if, what if I said
Do I really wanna spend the rest of my days
On a dead end street in a dead end job
I can live like that but my dreams won't stop
Go, just go
Just go with your heart
Go with the flow
There's only one way you're ever gonna know
Go
And just forget it
Everybody said it
But I know that I'd regret it if I did it
Go, just go
Just go with your heart
Go with the flow
There's only one way you're ever gonna know
Go
Just goI'm a long gone Waylon song on vinyl,
I'm a back roads sinner at a tent revival,
She believes in me like she believes her bible,
And loves me like Jesus does.
I'm a lead foot leaning on a suped up Chevy,
I'm a good ol' boy, drinking whiskey and rye on the levee,
But she carries me, when my sins make me heavy,
And loves me like Jesus does.
All the crazy in my dreams,
Both my broken wings,
Every single piece of everything I am,
She knows the man I ain't,
She forgives me when I can't,
The devil, man, he don't stand a chance,
'Cause she loves me like Jesus does.
Always thought she'd give up on me one day,
Wash her hands of me, leave me staring down some runway,
Yeah, I thank God each night, and twice on Sunday,
That she loves me like Jesus does.
All the crazy in my dreams,
And both my broken wings,
Every single piece of who I am,
Yeah, she knows the man I ain't,
She forgives me when I can't,
And the devil, man, no, he don't have a prayer,
'Cause she loves me like Jesus does.
Yeah, she knows the man I ain't,
She forgives me when I can't,
That the devil, man, he don't stand a chance,
She loves me like Jesus does.
I'm a long gone Waylon song on vinylDreams, that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful
Face anymore, I stare at a picture of you
And listen to the radio
Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation, I know,
That much is understood
And I realize
If you ask me how I'm doin' I would say I'm doin' just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
And no matter what they say, I'm not over you
Not over you
Damn, damn boy you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
You took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
You turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you
If you ask me how I'm doin' I would say I'm doin' just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
And no matter what I say, I'm not over you
And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then
If you ask me how I'm doin' I would say I'm doin' just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind ho-uh
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
And no matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you
Not over you
Not over youI'm in I'm out sure then I'm in doubt
What a crazy kind mixed up love I'm in
I win I lose I'm happy then I'm blue
What a crazy kind mixed up love I'm in
I tell myself I ought to leave you I almost make it through the door
I'd be a fool to try and leave you I'll just come back for me
Your hello goodbye make me laugh then cry
What a crazy kind mixed up love I'm in
Oh and I tell myself I ought to leave youHe was a rebel she was born across the tracks
Her parents had his never did
To look at them it didn't fit
Everyone whispered ain't it weird him with her
It'll never work that's what they said
But to this day he takes away her breath
Love didn't listen
It only hears what it wants to hear
Two hearts beating as one
The odds were against 'em
Oh but they had something on their side
When doubt said it can't be done
Love didn't listen
Married one summer and it was heaven seven years
Yeah, there were tears but no big deal
They just kept rollin' up love's hill
Then one night it happened, bitter words, slammin' doors
She said divorce he said me too
But even though it sounded like the thing to do
Love didn't listen
It only hears what it wants to hear
Two hearts beating as one
The odds were against 'em
Oh but they had something on their side
When doubt said it can't be done
Love didn't listen
It was an obstacle course
Had every negative force
Tellin' them they'll never make it (but)
Love didn't listen
It only hears what it wants to hear
Two hearts beating as one
The odds were against 'em
Oh but they had something on their side
When doubt said it can't be done
Love didn't listenThink of me when you're lonely
Think of me when you're blue
Think of me when you're far away
And I'll be thinking of you
Remember all of the good times
We had in days gone by
Remember all of the sadness
The day you said goodbye
You told me you would be leavin'
But you wouldn't be gone too long
Now I hope and pray with each new day
That you'll come a-travelin' home
Think of me when you're lonely
Think of me when you're blue
Think of me when you're far away
And I'll be thinking of you
I watch the mailman comin'
I wait by the telephone
I meet the trains down at the station
And I spend my nights alone
But now the waitin' is over
And Time has set the scene
'Cos God meant me for only you
And he meant you for meToday we laid old man Pate to rest
His big hands folded across his chest
God rest his soul just two days ago
He was in his yard waving to me
As I stood by his grave the impression was strong
One minute we're here and the next we're gone
And with each breath of life that is given to us
We should only have time for love
So tell me what can be gained by fussing and fighting
The answer is left up to us
I think it's time we learned enough is enough
Oh we should only have time for love
Sometimes I'm unwilling to open my eyes
Just too stubborn to compromise
When you stand your ground oh there's no backing down
That makes for a long bitter fight
And you know it's such a waste to engage in that
Tearing each other down in a tit for tat
When we could be hard at work building a trust
Oh we should only have time for love
So tell me what can be gained by fussing and fighting...
Well isn't it time we learned enough is enough
Oh we should only have time for loveOl' Jimmy, a real hard worker, loadin' trucks at the Feed and Save.
Well-liked, a really nice fella, that's why it's hard to believe.
One day, two counties over, he got caught with another man's wife.
Shots fired, smoke cleared, her husband took Jimmy's life.
In an instant, all the good stuff he'd ever done was all gone.
Now everybody just remembers the one thing that he did wrong.
You can have it all an' in the twinklin' of an eye,
It can all turn around.
If I live to roam this earth another hundred years,
Without 20 seconds from right now,
That ain't the way that I wanna go out.
Rob Jenkins, sittin' on the back pew, head bowed an' his eyes closed.
Preacher talkin' 'bout gettin' to Heaven, said, "Brother would you like to go?"
White knuckles holdin' his Hymnal, while the choir sang Amazing Grace.
He stands up, full of conviction, turns 'round an' runs out of that place.
Off in his truck, says to himself, "Next Sunday, I'm a-gonna get saved."
Runs a red light, hit broadside an' next Sunday is way too late.
You can have it all an' in the twinklin' of an eye,
It can all turn around.
If I live to roam this earth another hundred years,
Without 20 seconds from right now,
That ain't the way that I wanna go out.
I'm gonna do right, an' make sure I ask forgiveness before I go,
I'm gonna take time, 'cause it's a fine line,
Between here an' "You never know."
You can have it all an' in the twinklin' of an eye,
It can all turn around.
If I live to roam this earth another hundred years,
Without 20 seconds from right now,
That ain't the way that I wanna go out.
That ain't the way that I wanna go out.
No I don't wanna go out.(Dolly Parton)

Dolly: Now this actually came out in this magazine. Now, you folks I'm sure buy these every week at the supermarket, right? And you know they never put anything in these magazines that's not true, right? So I figured since I was gonna fall in love anyhow, why wait? So I went out and I found me a 300 pound wrestler and I sat down and I wrote a song called "Headlock on My Heart" and I did a video. As a matter of fact, in the same magazine on a page opposite, there was a picture of Hulk Hogan. Now, I love Hulk Hogan. My Daddy's crazy about him, so I called Hulk, I said "Would you do this?" 'Cause the song is a fantasy, and it's about a guy named Starlight Starbright. He said "Aw sure, I'd do anything with you, Dolly!" I said "Well, thanks, Hulk, I ought to hug your neck!" So wouldn't that be something if me and Hulk really wound up getting married? Watch this video...
Song:
The first time that I saw him
Was in a wrestling magazine.
Then I watched him on TV,
Then I bought a ringside seat.
His name was Starlight Starbright,
The greatest in the land.
He sprinkled stardust in my eyes
I was his biggest fan.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
It was a takedown from the start.
He's a master of the art.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
Spoken:
Referee: 300 pounds of magic right here in the ring tonight.
Starlight Starbright: Wrestling fans, big and small, who's the greatest of them all?
Dolly: Starlight! Starlight Starbright! Starlight! Starlight Starbright!
He dazzled 'em with brilliance,
He outshined all the rest.
And I loved the heart that beat
Beneath his massive golden chest.
Spoken:
Dolly: In this ring, I thee wed.
Referee: Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
Starlight Starbright: I do!
Referee: And do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
Dolly: I do, I truly do!
Referee: I now pronounce you man and wife.
Dolly: Uh, you may now kiss the bride.
He's got a headlock on my heart,
That it may likely never part.
He knew the ropes right from the start.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
Spoken:
Dolly: Well, it's a whole new arena for me,
But it's a whole new wrestling match for him.
I guess you could say he pinned me down for a lifetime.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
It was a takedown from the start.
He's a master of the art.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
He's got a headlock on my heart,
That it may likely never part.
He knew the ropes right from the start.
He's got a headlock on my heart.Starting over again is a bit like dancing,
You just need someone to lead and take it slow,
So lay your head on my shoulder,
Let me hold you close, that's it
There you go
There you go, you're doing fine
Take each day like a step, one at a time
Put one foot in front of the other
And the next thing you know
That's it
There you go
Every day is like a new beginning
One door opens, while another starts to close
But just slip your arms around me
Cause life's a dance, don't know
That's it
There you go
There you go, you're doing fine
Take each day like a step, one at a time
Put one foot in front of the other
And the next thing you know
That's it
There you go
I know how it feels to have your heart crossed
Like the wings of the butterfly
But you gotta try
So just hold on tight
Put one foot in front of the other
And the next thing you know
You're dancing
There you go
That's it
There you goI am weak but Thou art strong Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long as I walk let me walk close to Thee
Just a closer walk with Thee grant it Jesus is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee let it be dear Lord let it be
When my feeble life is o'er time for me will be no more
Guide me gently safely o'er to Thy kingdom shore to Thy shore
Just a closer walk with Thee
Let it be dear Lord let it beI CAN'T SLEEP WITH YOU
(Mike Kosser - Steve Pippin)

WITH MARY LOU TURNER
I can't sleep with you I can't sleep with you
I can't sleep with you on my mind
Here I lay in bed tossing and turning
The fires of love we once knew are still burning
I'm living with your mem'ry all the time
I can't sleep with you I can't sleep with you
I can't sleep with you on my mind
I've tried everything I know to help my sleeping
But sleep won't come to eyes that burn from weeping
It's funny cause I've never been the crying kind
I can't sleep with you I can't sleep with you
I can't sleep with you on my mind
I have all the empty hours I can stand
Life is nothing to a woman without a love of her sweet man
And it seems like the nights just get longer and longer all the time
Cause I can't sleep with you I can't sleep with you
I can't sleep with you on my mindOver the ground lies a mantel of white
A heaven of diamonds
Shine down through the night
Two hearts are thrilling
In spite of the chilling weather . . .
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, are you married, we'll say, no man
But you can do the job while you're in townHow many arms have held you
And hated to let you go?
How many? How many? I wonder
But I really don't want to know
And how many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow?
How many? How many? I wonder
But I really don't want to know
So always make me wonder
And always make me guess
Even if I ask you
Darlin', don't confess
No you just let that remain your secret
Cause darlin', I do love you so
How many? How many? I wonder
But I really don't want to knowOh jealous me and careless you the odds were just too great
I couldn't take those lonely nights you made me sit and wait
I thought I'd seen the last of you when you walked out of sight
Instead I see you in my dreams each night
So the key's in the mailbox come on in
I'm sitting here wishing dear I had your love again
I'll never even ask you where you've been the key's in the mailbox come on in
I said I'd rather be alone than share your company
I said don't come around at all if you want more than me
But sitting here alone I can't deny the flame that burns
I'd gladly take you back on any terms
So the key's in the mailbox...Little girls and little boys often cry over broken toys
But tears which fall like gentle rain wash away the hurt and pain
Little girls and little boys when they grow older change their toys
They learn that life's a hurting game but never know who's to blame
No more a child is the saddest line ever written in the sands of time
No matter how heavy the tide of tears no more can they wash away the fears
Pretty women grown off men try but can't go back again
And they're lost like all the toys they had as little girls and boys
(Everything's lost like all the toys) they had as little girls and boysComb your hair and paint and powder
You act proud and I'll act prouder
You sing loud and I'll sing louder
Tonight we're settin' the woods on fire
You're my gal and I'm your feller
Dress up in your frock and yeller
I'll look swell but you'll look sweller
Settin' the woods on fire
We'll take in all the honky tonks
Tonight we're havin' fun
We'll show the folks a brand new dance
That never has been done
Well, I don't care who thinks we're silly
You'll be daffy and I'll be dilly
Order up two bowls of chili
Settin' the woods on fire
Hmm, I'll gas up my hot rod stoker
We'll get hotter than a poker
You'll be broke but I'll be broker
Tonight we're settin' the woods on fire
We'll sit close to one another up our street
And down the other
We'll have us a time, oh brother
Settin' the woods on fire
We'll put aside a little time
To fix a flat or two
My trey and tubes are doin' fine
The air's showin' through
You clap hands and I'll start bowin'
We'll do all the law's allowin'
Tomorrow I'll be right back plowin'
Settin' the woods on fireOh you'll never miss the water till the well runs dry
You'll regret each and every time you've made me cry
You'll never miss me darling till I say goodbye
Oh you'll never miss the water till the well runs dry
You thought you were taking candy from a baby
But I caught you with your fingers in the pie
Now you'd better realize just what you're doing
Cause you'll never miss the water till the well runs dry
Oh you'll never miss the water...
[ steel - dobro ]
Well I've headed up to here with all your cheatin'
And those little lies you tell me on the sly
Now you'd better listen close to what I'm sayin'
Cause you'll never miss the water till the well runs dry
Oh you'll never miss the water...
Oh you'll never miss the water till the well runs dryWhen dark of night makes way for the early sun to rise
It's piece of mind that only love can bring
And with the golden sunlight drifting through the morning skies
Your tender touch makes me know that love is a gentle thing
Love is a gentle thing and love can keep you safe and warm
A newborn baby nestled in its mother's arms
Love is a gentle thing and like winter's very first snow falling
And love can be a shelter in a storm
The times when I'm uncertain and get restless in my mind
I'm left alone without a song to sing
But when you come to me at night and pull me to your side
Without a word you tell me that love is a gentle thing
Love is a gentle thing
Love is a gentle thingYeah I'm lookin' aint' everybody lookin'
For that one of a kind, one in a million
Match made in heaven that we all know
Probably don't exist, what's that,
Yeah I'm a little jaded, over it, cynical
Maybe even a litle bitter about all the chances I've missed
'Cause I've seen it all come and go before
I'm sure I'll see it again
But if I thought for one instant it might be love
I'd be the first one jumpin' in
Here I go fallin'
The minute love starts callin'
Here I go fallin'
For all it's worth, for better or worse
Like I've never been burned and I won't get hurt
Yeah I know it's kinda fast, I only met her last night
So what makes me think this one's gonna be any different?
Let's just say I've got a real good feeling about it
Is it meant to be? Do I think it's gonna last?
Don't ask me, I ain't going there, I ain't touching that
But I'll tell you this
Every time I get close to her
I can't think of nothin' else
She's in every thought, every dream I ever dream
I can't stop myself
Here I go fallin'
The minute love starts callin'
Here I go fallin'
For all it's worth, for better or worse
Like I've never been burned and I won't get hurt
It was sure nice talkin' to you but I really gotta run
'Cause I think I finally found her man here she comes
Here I go fallin'
The minute love starts callin'
Here I go fallin'
For all it's worth, for better or worse
Like I've never been burned and I won't get hurtTempted and tried we're oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested though in the wrong
[Chorus]
Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
When death has come and taken our loved ones
It leaves our home so lonely and drear
And then do we wonder why others prosper
Living so wicked year after year
[Chorus]
When we see Jesus coming in glory
When he comes down from his home in the sky
Then we shall meet him in that bright mansion
We'll understand it all by and by
[Chorus]
Yeah we'll understand it all by and byI heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow
Got in trouble had to roam I left my gal and left my home
I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow.
Just a kid acting smart I went and broke my darling's heart
I guess I was too young to know
They took me off that Georgia Main locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow.
All alone I bear the shame, I'm a number not a name
I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow
All I do is sit and cry when the evening train goes by
I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow.
I'll be locked here in this cell till my body's just a shell
And my hair turns whiter than snow
I'll never see that gal of mine, I'm in Georgia doing time
I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blowDon't you sleep
Don't you have
a single moment's peace
Just walk through the darkness
With fears that are deep
And don't you even sleep
Don't you smile
Don't you have
happy thoughts for a while
'Til teardrops and sadness
Both go out of style
No, don't you even smile
Chorus:
These are the things
I wish for you
Deep in my heart
How I hope they come true
And then you'll know
When bad turns to worse
What it's like to live
under love's curse
Chorus
Don't you try
To have a single
Thought that goes by
Without being haunted
By memories like mine
No, don't you even tryI had a broken watch on a broken chain
I had a rood that leaked every time it rained
I had an old guitar that wouldn't stay in tune
But now it sounds just fine since I've met you
I'm good as new
I had some crazy thoughts runnin' through my brain
Wonderin' if my life was goin' down the drain
I had a broken heart, broken right in two
But now it's in one piece since I've met you
I'm good as new
You made my life like a lullaby
You put the spark back into my eyes
You put the shine in the shining sea
And you hung the moon where it should be
Now my old yard is looking nice and green
And my old car, well, it's a clean machine
Even my old dog, she can feel it too
It's not the same old thing since I've met you
I'm good as newLOVE'S ENDLESS WAR
WRITER ROGER COOK
Hearts have been broken
in the game of true love
I'm afraid to surrender
I'm not strong enough
Give it all away
open up every door
My heart is a castle
in love's endless war
Dreams can betray you
When you're far out that sea
Many proud hearts have foundered
on love's mutinyI had a gal oh what a gal and her name was Saddie Brown
I took her out to ride about as the moon was shining down
When we got home we'd sat alone out in the old porch swing
And that dear little miss she would give me a kiss and sweetly to her I would sigh
Lay-lady little lay-lady I love no one but you
We'll get marry in June take a long honeymoon and settle down there for a life
Lay-lady little lay-lady I want you by my side
[ ac.guitar ]
We'll get marry in June...
Lay-lady little lay-ladyHOW DO YOU TELL SOMEONE
(Miriam Eddy aka Jessi Colter
How do you tell someone you don't care how do you say I don't love you
Win the heart that you're tellin' is so good and true and loves no one but you
And how could my heart be made of stone oh why must this be
I'm unable to give my love to one who gave her life for me
And how could my heart be made of stone...Well there's always been groups of people that never could see eye to eye
And I always thougt if they ever had a chance to sit down and talk face to face
They might realize they got a lot in common
Well I was sittin' in a coffee shop
Just havin' a cup to pass the time
Swapin' rodeo stories with this old cowboy friend of mine
When some motorcycle riders started snickerin' in the back
Started pokin' fun at my friend's hat
One ol' boy said "Hey Tex where'd you park your horse?"
My friend just pulled his hat down low but they couldn't be ignored
One husky fella said "I think I'll rip that hat right off your head."
That's when my friend turned around and this is what he said
"You'll ride a black tornado 'cross the western sky
Rope an ol blue norter and milk it till it's dry
Bulldog the Mississippi, pin it's ears down flat
Long before you take this cowboys hat
"Now partner this old hat is better left alone
See it used to be my daddy's
But, last year he passed on
My nephew skined the rattler that makes up this ol' hatband
But, back in sixty nine he died in vietnam
Now the eagle feather was given to me by an indian friend of mine
But, someone ran he down somewhere around that Arizona line
And a real special lady gave me this hatpin
And I don't know if I'll ever see her again
"You'll ride a black tornado 'cross the western sky
Rope an ol blue norter and milk it till it's dry
Bulldog the Mississippi, pin it's ears down flat
Long before you take this cowboys hat
"now if your leather jaket means to you what this hat means to me
Then I guess we understand each other and we'll just let it be
But, if you still think it's funny, man you got my back up against the wall
And if you touch my hat you're gonna havta fight us all"
Well right then I caught a little sadness in that gang leader's eyes
He turned back to the others and they all just kinda shuffled on outside
But when my friend turned back towards me
I noticed he's ol' hatbrim
Well it was turned up in a big ol' Texas grin
"You'll ride a black tornado 'cross the western sky
Rope an ol blue nortern and milk it till it's dry
Bulldog the Mississippi, pin it's ears down flat
Long before you take this cowboys hat"Let me live again let me live again
[ steel ]
A little taste of heaven that I had before
Was just enough to keep me coming back for more
After loving you losing you was more than I could stand
Now I'm the ghost of what was once a man
Let me live again let me live again reach into my heart and light the light of love again
Let me see the sun let this darkness end
Take me back into your arms and let me live again
It would have been much better that we never met
An angel's love like yours is too much to forget
I can't help myself cause I can't be stronger than I am
I'm just the ghost of what was once a man
Let me live again...You once dreamed of castles and merry go rounds
To be Cinderella in an Alice movie
Now side streets and back beats and what might have been
Lead you to nowhere again and again
The curtain is calling, come take your bow
It's getting too late for turning back now
Can you still believe that life's a cabaret
And fairy tales will carry you away
It's closing time and you're left on your own
And only you can find a way back home
You look under rainbows look over the lies
You look for an answer in anyone's eyes
Reach out for lovers in too many beds
Reach for the needle but can't hold a thread
Whiskey and roses fill your loving cup
Leaving you empty when the sun's coming up
And you still believe that life's a cabaret
And fairy tales will carry you away
When loneliness is the world you've ever known
And only you can find the way back home
That knight in shining armor, you know he'll never come
On to the cabaret old chum
Do you still believe that life's a cabaret
That fairy tales will carry you away
Its closing time and you're left on your own
And only you can find a way back home
The way back home
The way back home
The way back homeRemember how lonely I told you it would be
Without you here with me
But you just turned and walked away
And now that I've found somebody new
You've changed your tune
You want me back but all I can say
[Chorus]
It's too late now
Just tell me how long did you think
I'd be your fool
And I would sit right here an' wait
For you to make up
Your mind to show up
Well, just turn around
I'm sorry it's too late now
Well didn't I tell you that one of these days
It would be too late
To say you'd made a big mistake
And now you've come back like you've never been gone
Well baby you're wrong
Somebody else has taken your place
[Chorus]Almost a lifetime of
Going nowhere
Through all of the motions
It took to be me
No one to love me but I
Didn't care
Had walls all around me and
I thought I was free
[Chorus:]
'Til (And) you made me
See you're some kind
Of light
Can't help but see such a
Beautiful sight
You opened my eyes and
Before I could blink
You had all of my vies
And I'm startin' to think
That you made me feel
That's all there is to it
You made me feel like
You knew I could do it
Put a heart where there's
Nothing' and you made
Me real
And that's just how you
Made me feel
I must have been lonely
Though I couldn't
Have known
Love was the only thing I
Was not looking for
Wandering aimless in a
World of my own
Pleasure and painless 'til
You opened the doorA lullaby can make me cry like the song of long ago
I still can see another me and the girl I used to know
I should forget but I won't let little mem'ries overflow
And through the tears and misty years like the stardust as I go
I think of when she loved me then and of how she told me so
The words unsung when we were young like the song of long ago
But where's the end there is no end to the timeless after glow
A sweet regret I always get from the song of long agoI don't have too much to say
'Bout most things anyway
The weather's cold or it's hot
It's either wet or it's not
I'm no expert on life
I just try to do right
I'm a man of few words
But since you asked about her
[Chorus:]
I love her and I need her
I'll do anything to please her
'Cause I like to see her smile
And watch her eyes light up
Just like the morning sun
The day I met her
Knew I never would forget her
So I bought a ring and put it on her finger
And I promised her my heart
Forever more and I won't ever take it back
And that's all I've got to say about that
Well I'm just quiet I guess
I ain't got much on my chest
I try to keep a good name
I stay dry when it rains
Fish bite or they don't
But if you're talking they won't
So I'm saving my breath
For something worth being said
[Chorus]
I love her and I need her
I'll do anything to please her
'Cause I like to see her smile
And watch her eyes light up
Just like the morning sun
The day I met her
Knew I never would forget her
So I bought a ring and put it on her finger
And I promised her my heart
Forever more and I won't ever take it back
And that's all I've got to say about thatI'm a western North Carolinean made of stone and red place oil
I got Cherokee blood deep within me when I was born it began to boil
Well I left my home across the mountains to see what kind of life I'd find
Well I searched the world in all directions to try to cool this restless mind
[ dobro ]
Found myself on a lonesome journey the streets of gold I tried to find
The Indian spirit it softly whispered and cooled the blood ever restless mind
I'm going back to the Smokey Mountains and breathe the air that fit my soul
Now there we read in the leaves of history and there I'll find my streets of gold
And there I'll find my streets of goldBorn like everyone with a slate as clean
Baby grew into a boy and started building steam
Boy learned how to blow it off in a dangerous kind of way
Well fellas here he comes that runaway train
Now hear his lonesome cry barrelin' down the track
Out of control his soul dressed in black
Sound to every man thats broken the chain
Rollin rollin rollin like a runaway train
It ain't easy to do your best when life comes at you fast
On his own so early on too young for such a task
Took the bull by the horn sometimes that bull was mean
And only at it stoking on that runaway train
Chorus
Married young and daddy soon his life was right on track
Something rumbled in his soul something that he lacked
He had to chase that melody that fueled a childhood dream
There ain't no holding back that runaway train
Chorus
Rollin rollin rollin like a runaway train
Hmmm I here that train a comin'
Hmmm Hey Porter Ohh Porter
Hmmm I don't care if I do da doSteam on the window where you draw those little hearts
On those nights we'd take the long way home and find a place to park
Remember makin' love on a spring break beach
In Panama City, had a hell of a week
Young and wild and nothin' could tear us apart
Yeah I'll never forget the way I felt
The first time you said those three words to me
It's kind of hard to believe
That you ain't nothin' but a memory
A used to be
My best friend that I loved like crazy
The only one
I thought I'd ever need
You're just a one time way back when
Back when it was you and me
But now
You ain't nothin' but a memory
Well theres a handful of pictures in a dusty shoebox
Sittin' in your closet right behind that dress you wore to senior prom
So if you're lonley tonight and missin' those times
Take a look inside if you're lookin for me
'Cause that's where I'll be
'Cause you ain't nothin' but a memory
A used to be
My best friend that I loved like crazy
The only one
I thought I'd ever need
You're just a one time way back when
Back when it was you and me
But now
You ain't nothin' but a memory
It's another missed call
a midnight text
Another temptation
makeup sex
No
It's time to let it all go
'Cause you ain't nothin' but a memory
A used to be
My best friend that I loved like crazy
The only one
I thought I'd ever need
You ain't nothin' but a memory
A used to be
My best friend that I loved like crazy
The only one
I thought I'd ever need
You're just a one time way back when
You're just a one time way back when
Back when it was you and me
But now
You ain't nothin' but a memory
Now you ain't nothin' but a memoryOooh,OOh,Oooh-ooh,Oh,Oh,Oh,Oh-oh-oh-oh.
Well, I can't tell you where I'm going
I'm not sure of where I've been
But I know I must keep travelin'
Till my road comes to an end
I'm out here on my journey
Trying to make the most of it
I'm a puzzle I must figure out
Where all my pieces fit
Chorus
Like a poor wayfairing stranger
That they speak about in song
I'm just a weary pilgrim
Trying to find what feels like home
Well, that is no one can tell me
Am I doomed to ever roam
I'm just travelin' travelin' travelin'
I'm just travelin' on.
Questions I have many
Ansewers but a few
We're here to learn the spirit burns
To learn the greater truth
We've all been crusified
And they nailed Jesus to the tree
And when I'm born again
You're gonna see a change in me
God made me for a reason
And nothing is in vain
Redemption comes in many shapes
With many kinds of pain
Oh, sweet Jesus if you're out there
Keep me ever close to you
As I'm stumbling tumbling
As I'm traveling through
I'm just traveling traveling traveling.
I'm just traveling through ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.
I'm just traveling traveling
I'm just traveling through ooho ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.
Oh sometimes the road gets rugged
And it's hard to travelin' on
But hold in to each other
We don't have to work alone
When everything is broken
We can mend it if we try
We can make the world a difference
If we want to we can fllly.
Good-bye you little children
Good-night you handsome men
Farewell to all you ladies
And to all who knew me when...
And I hope I'll see ya down the road
You meant more than I knew
As I'm travelin' travelin' travelin' travelin' travelin' through
Drifting like a floating boat
And roaming like the wind
Oh give me some direction lord
Let me lean on you
As I'm travelin' travelin' through (Repeat, Repeat)
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like the poor wayfaring stranger
That they speak about in song
I'm just like a weary pilgrim
Tryin' to find my own way home
Oh, sweet jesus if you're out there
Keep me ever close to you
As I'm travelin' travelin' travelin' through
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh travelin' through.I never had time to wonder if you were happy or sad
I never had the time to ask you what kind of day you had
For I was too busy to notice that we were drifting apart
Never had time to see just what you meant to me
And now I've got nothing but time
I never had time to tell you, it was nice just having you near
I never had the time to look for some small way to say that I care
The time just flew and I didn't see that I was breaking your heart
Never had time to see just what you meant to me
And now I've got nothing but timeOh well, I'm tired and so weary
But I must go alone
Till the lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes
Well the morning's so bright
And the lamb will be delight
And the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me
Well the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be lit by a child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for meHe's taking it hard she's taking it easy
She's living it up and he's living it down
He's walking the floor looking for answers
She's out on the floor all over town
Ain't that the way that love goes when love goes to pieces
Ain't that the truth when you find out you're living a lie
Ain't love the reason we both took a chance on each other
Ain't it each other we both swore we wanted to try
He's taking it hard she's taking it easy
She's drying her eyes but his are still wet
He wishes he could just hold her until she remembers
She wishes she could find someone to make her forget
He's taking it hard she's taking it easyThe sandman told me he's done all he can
The situation calls for more than sand
You been cryin' all night long
Tossin' and turnin' and it's almost dawn
I am here I'm gonna help you sleep
Count on me instead of countin' sheep
Close your eyes and leave the rest of me.
You'll have sweet dreams that'll last all night
And easy feeling in the morning light
Drift away with the touch of the hand
From the sleep tight goodnight man.
Soft and soothing as a lullaby
I'll kiss the tears from those weary eyes
And in the morning you will understand
You've been touched by the goodnight man
I'll rock you gently like a rolling wave
Hold you in my arms till you drift away
Just lay back and leave the rest to me.
You'll have sweet dreams that'll last all night
And easy feeling in the morning light
Drift away with the touch of the hand
From the sleep tight goodnight man.
You'll have sweet dreams that'll last all night
And easy feeling in the morning light
Drift away with the touch of the hand
From the sleep tight goodnight man.
You'll have sweet dreams that'll last all night
And easy feeling in the morning light
Drift away with the touch of the hand
From the sleep tight goodnight man...(Porter Wagoner)
Chorus:
Oh, on a highway headed south somewhere to Dixie
Where the cotton blooms in the spring and the snow don't fly
I'm gonna rest these chillin' bones in the Southern sunshine
And live where the weather's warm until I die
North Dakota, you got my better years
Montana, you got five years of my life
But the earth's sub-zero wind will never touch me again
A Southern girl can't live on snow and ice
Repeat Chorus
When I cross the Dixie line, I'll throw away my coat
And my goose-down underwear will have to go
I'll never live again where the weather chills you to the bone
I'm tired of livin' like an Eskimo
Repeat Chorus
On a highway headed south somewhere to Dixie
Where the cotton blooms in the spring and the snow don't fly
I'm gonna rest these willin' bones in the Southern sunshine
And live where the weather's warm until I die
Repeat Chorus & FadeI put down my razor
Toweled off my face
Thought I saw a new wrinkle
And another strand of gray
That one little scar
Kept catching my eye
Reminding me how time does fly
I was only a kid
When I had that first fight
But I still don't give in
When I believe that I'm right
And at least I can stand here
And like what I see
In the man that kid turned out to be
Lookin back at myself
It's plain to see
That the cold hands of time
Ain't had much mercy on me
But I played a straight game
With the cards that were dealt
And I can look straight ahead
Lookin'back at myself
Now I ain't been no angel
But I learned right from wrong
Thanks to mamma and a hickory
And a love so strong
Yes she taught the rule
That life is lived by
I ain't forgot what you get
For getting'out of line
Now this old world throws some punches
And I've taken a few
Now my skin's tough as leather
But I've grown strong with the truth
There's been so many times I could've just stepped aside
Ah but then I couldn't stand here with this peace of mind
Lookin'back at myself
It's plain to see
That the cold hands of time
Ain't had much mercy on me
But I played a straight game
With the cards that were dealt
And I can look straight ahead
Lookin'back at myselfShe labored so hard in this world below she didn't have things that most mothers know
Raising her children on a widow's small pay washing and ironing since dad passed away
I wanna go to heaven when this life is o'er I wanna be with Jesus on eternity shore
But if I've a crown coming when rewards go around
Please blessed Jesus give mother my crown
[ fiddle - dobro ]
I didn't realize it when I was a lad just how great a burden my mother had
Adoption was offered but mama said no
She raised us and taught us the right way to go
I wanna go to heaven...She's so kissable, huggable, loveable, unbelievable.
She's a mouth full of anything and everything a man could want.
Yeah
She aint typical, she aint predictable, she's available. It's a miracle
How my heart stumbled into someone so: kissable, huggable, loveable, unbelievable.
Up to now my life has been so lonely, and boring, never thought I would find someone so elegant, intelligent, heaven sent, all my money spent.
I put a big down payment on that iddy bitty diamond ring.
She's so beautiful, its undisputable, its undeniable, she's gunna have a bawl, she's music to my ears and makes my heart sing so, kissable, huggable, loveable, unbelievable.
O that's nice.
There are so many things I want to tell her like I love her, but every time talk I start to s.s.s.s.stutter.
She's so elegant, intelligent, heaven sent, all my money spent, put a dig down payment on that iddy bitty diamond ring.
She's so beautiful, its undisputable, its undeniable she's
Gunna have a bawl, she's music to my ears and makes my heart sing so:
Kissable, huggable, loveable, unbelievable.
Kissable, huggable, loveable, unbelievable
Kissable, huggable, loveable, unbelievableWhen I was a little bitty baby my mommy would rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
When I was a little bitty baby my mommy would rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
Well when of them cotton bolls get rotten you can't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields back home
Yes it was down in Louisiana just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home
When I was a little bitty baby
Yes again in them old cotton fields back home
Well in them old I said cotton fields back homeOne sweet hello
And one sad goodbye
Two empty arms
And these lonely nights to cry
Together is was heaven
But how quickly time did fly
With one sweet hello
And one sad goodbye
These precious mem'ries linger on
Haunting my mind since you're gone
These little things between us
That really have no ties
Are all we had together and all we realize
Was one sweet helloOne comes of it
Love it, love it
Let go of it
Love comes from it
We're not of this world for long
Faith and promise keep me honest
When starvation falls upon us
Daylight told me he would be
Gone with cold words
Spoke among hers
Wretched in the tongue of their world
We're not of that world at all
We will never be
Wouldn't it be fine to stand
Behind the words we say in the best of times
Oh, and you and I know all too well
About the hell in paradise
Right here on Earth
Keep it, use it
Build it, move it
Planes can touch our time will prove it
Watch us fly as loud we can
Let her heartbeat change what I am now
Wouldn't it be fine to stand
Behind the words we say
In the best of times
Oh, and you and I know all too well
About the hell in paradise
Right here on EarthGirl you melt me like ice and whiskey
With those blue fling looks that you give me,
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killing me right now to see
You wanna slip off with me again
Why should we go round and round the truth,
Like we been doin'?
Every time we lie girl we're losing
So why should we spend Saturday night alone,
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull and all nighter chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
Get a little higher (get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire
You act like you don't know what you're missing,
Every time you end up back with him
'Cause it's safe, and you're scared.
Of everything you're feeling when
We're burning the midnight down again
Why should we go round and round the truth, like we been doin?
Every time we lie girl we're losing
So why should we spend Saturday night alone,
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull and all nighter chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
Get a little higher (get a little higher),
Sippin' on fire
Every goodbye is bitter sweet,
So why should we fight what we both need?
Why should we go round and round the truth, like we been doin?
Every time we lie girl we're losing
So why should we spend Saturday night alone,
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull and all nighter chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
Get a little higher (get a little higher),
Sippin' on fire
Girl you melt me like ice and whiskey
With those blue fling looks that you give me,
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killing me right now to see
You wanna slip off with meWith a love like our love
I don't need nobody else
I could try to help you
But honey I can't help myself
In the middle of the week
I can feel your body moving on
Wait a minute let me speak
Tell me that you love me
But your heart's as good as gone
Honey if you're leaving
You don't have to tell me why
Don't get a reason
When his dreams are gonna die
If you're leaving on the greyhound
Take a minute think about your past
All the people that you let down
Tell me that you love me
But it wasn't made to last
So ask me about the time that we met
You were passed out on the front lawn
Try to talk to you and ask you where you from
Baby what's going on?
I thought I knew but I was wrong
Who would of known that baby
All along heart was as good as gone
And if my heartache leads me down a road of shame
Could I believe you'd still call my name?
God believe in all that stuff
But darling you
You never haunted me enoughFlaws, everybody's got 'em
You can bet your last two dollars
There ain't no tens
All them flaws
Ones you came with or you caused them
Scars or tattoos that went rotten
We all got flaws
The woman that I love, she's purer than a dove
I know her best than anyone I guess
The thing I like the most, the wrinkle on her nose
And all the little parts that are unique
All her flaws, everybody's got 'em
You can bet your last two dollars
There ain't no tens
All them flaws
Ones you came with, or you caused them
Scars or tattoos that went rotten
We all got flaws, aw, yeah
Yeah, I look at my two eyes
Left higher than the right
I guess that's just the way I'm supposed to be
I snore when I'm asleep, got long and lanky feet
The pieces of the puzzle that I am
All my flaws, everybody's got 'em
You can bet your last two dollars
There ain't no tens
All them flaws
Ones you came with or you caused them
Scars or tattoos that went rotten
We all got them flaws
So, never be ashamed, embarrassed or afraid
'Cause everyone has something they don't like
Remember we're all made with water, dirt and grace
We're all perfect in the eyes that see
All our flaws, everybody's got 'em
You can bet your last two dollars
There ain't no tens
All them flaws
Ones you came with or you caused them
Scars or tattoos that went rotten
We all got flaws
We all got flaws
Everybody's got a few flaws, flaws, flaws, yeah
Nobody's perfectWell I must've had a ball last night
I can't recall what even started our fight
I must've drank away my blues
Cause I don't remember losin' you
Well I must've done the town up right
Cause this morning my hats just a little too tight
There ain't no way of knowin'
But all the signs are showin'
I must've had a ball last night
Well I woke up this mornin'
Underneath my bed
And someone's in the kitchen sink
With cowboy boots on and nothin' else at all
Except my hat turned backway on her head
Well I must've had a ball last night
I can't recall what even started out fight
Well I must've drank away my blues
Cause I don't remember losing you
Well I must've done the town up right
Cause this morning my hats just a little too tight
There ain't no way of knowin'
But all the signs are showin'
I must've had a ball last night
Well my picture's on the table
Somebody tore it right in two
Well who'd do such a crazy thing
Someone took your suitcase and your little car
And I hate it 'cause the tires are new
Yeah, I must've had a ball last night
I can't recall what even started out fight
I must've drank away my blues
Cause I don't remember losing you
Well I must've done the town up right
Cause this morning my hats just a little too tight
There ain't no way of knowin'
But all the signs are showin'
I must've had a ball last night
Well I must've done the town up right
Cause this morning my hats just a little too tight
There ain't no way of knowing
But all the signs are showing
I must've had a ball last night
Well, there ain't way knowin'
But all the signs are showin'
I must've had a ball last nightHere is one that we took one Sunday afternoon I remember it was in the summer time
On the back it says eight eleven sixty five the same day you promised to be mine
But old pictures have a way of fading like a love that wasn't meant to be
Still each night I dig out the family album but old photographs sure get to me
[ piano ]
Here it is it's the last one that we took together
Though it's faded a little more than the rest
I suppose it's because of all the tearstains on it
Bit it's the one that to me you look the best
Yes old pictures have a way...
Yes old photographs sure get to meThe sun's goin' down on me
Thoughts of her keep haunting me
Desperation's taking hold
My hands are on the steering wheel
But my heart's back in Louisville
At the far end of a thousand miles of road
My mind's grinding like a steel gear, baby
I've got to cover some ground
She know how hard and fast I'm falling for her
If she could just hear the sound
Of the hammer goin' down
Now I ain't gonna waste my time
Talkin' on no pay phone line
Words just don't get the message through
If this rig will hold out one more day
She'll hear me forty miles away
Tearing this four lane half in two
My mind is grinding like a steel gear, baby
I've got to cover some ground
She know how hard and fast I'm falling for her
If she could just hear the sound
Of the hammer goin' down
Now she ain't just a truck stop queen
She's like God to me
A thousand miles for her love
Well, I'd go a million for one kiss
Drive those pistons with my fist
And do it all again if it ain't enough
My mind's grinding like a steel gear, baby
I've got to cover some ground
She know how hard and fast I'm falling for her
If she could just hear the sound
Of the hammer goin' down
If she could hear the sound
Of the hammer goin' down
If she could hear the sound
Of the hammer goin'
Of the hammer goin' downSome people wish
Some people dance
Some never take a chance
Some people steal
Just for the thrill
And some drink to get their fill
But I love you
Some people preach
Some people write
And some choose to just stay quiet
Some people teach
Some people roam
Some would rather be alone
But I love you, yeah
Some people hurt
Some people laugh
And some just don't know what they have
But I love you
Baby I love you, yeahJust a mile west of the water tank
On a cold November day
In a cold and lonesome box car
A dyin hobo lay
His pal sat there before him
With a low and drooping head
Listening to the last words
His dying buddy said
Goodbye old pardner hobo
I hate to say goodbye
But I hear my train a comin
& I know shes getting nigh
Gonna tell that old conductor
Just when I'm gonna stop
Where the little stream of water
Comes tumblin down the rock
We rode the rocks together
We rambled all around
In every kind of weather
We slept out on the ground
Oh pardner don't you miss that train
That always makes a stop
Where the little stream of water
Comes tumblin down the rock
Would you tell my girl from Danville
That she need not worry a tall
I'm a goin to that country
Where I won't have to work at all
No I wll not have to work there
Or never change my socks
Where the little stream of water
Comes tumblin down the rocks
I'm a goin to that better place
Where everything is right
Where handouts grow on bushes
And they sleep out every night
I won't have to wash my overhauls
Or never change my socks
Where the little stream of water
Comes tumblin down the rocksSilent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Silent night, holy night
Son of God love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face (Thy holy face)
Oh, with dawn of redeeming grace
Christ the Savior is born
Jesus the Savior is born
Oh, Christ the Savior is born, ooh
Jesus the Savior is bornWell, I was going down the road when she caught my eye
That little red Corvette with a for sale sign
Laid my money down and walked out the door
Wondering what a pickup man wants a convertible for
For you blue eyes five foot two
For you I do the crazy things I know I really shouldn't oughta do
I've either lost touch with reality or I've found a dream come true
I'd climb the Himalayas swim a river full of gators for you
I got a fishing rod and a set of golf clubs
Just sittin' in a corner collecting dust
I'm a certified lunatic some might say
It wouldn't mean a thing to me to give them all away
For you blue eyes five foot two
I'd do the crazy things I know
I really shouldn't ought to do
I'd climb the Himalayas swim a river full
Of gators for you, hmm for youYour breath is sweet
Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth
On the pillow where you lie
I don't sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not to me
But to the stars above
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
Your daddy, he's an outlaw
A wanderer by trade
He'll teach you how to pick and choose
And how to throw the blade
He oversees his kingdom
No stranger dare intrude
His voice, it trembles as he calls
For another plate of food
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
Your sister sees the future
Like your mama and yourself
You've never learned to read or write
There's no books upon your shelf
Your pleasure knows no limits
Your voice is like a lark
But your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
Oh, to the valley belowWell I Like My Women Like I Like My Coffee In The Morning And Steaming Hot

We?ve got plans and we?ve got dreams, we?ve got a long way to go.
Pack up all of your emotions, all your faith and devotion.
We?re gonna need it this I know.
If you?re at the edge of the past, our futures unfolding fast.
Baby, don?t look back.
(Chorus)
We?re going to a new frontier, wide open without fear.
I?ll walk this winding road with you into the great unknown.
We?re going to a new frontier
Let?s trust our love will lead us right where we belong.
Walk on.
I can?t wait to get out of here,
The wind is up and the path is clear for the first time in my life.
Our destination don?t concern me, more and more I?m longing.
It?s the journey; it?s the ride.
Everything is within our grasp,
If we have the courage to ask and we don?t look back.
(Chorus)
We?re going to a new frontier, wide open without fear.
I?ll walk this winding road with you into the great unknown.
We?re going to a new frontier

I?ll walk this winding road with you into the great unknown.
We?re going to a new frontier
let?s trust our love will lead us right where we belong.
And walk on.Two partners went in search of gold as friendly as could be
One was young and one was old and the gay young fool was me
Since neighter one could write his name we swore upon our souls
To share the wealth and then shook hands the hands that dug for gold
The summer days were gone at last and winter nights grew cold
The snow had trapped us in the pass when we finally find the gold
We took our fortune to the shack to wait the winter through
But the food ran low so I killed my friend what else there was to do
I threw his body just outside into the bitter cold
Somehow I had to stay alive I now had all the gold
But the howling wind just seemed to say you have killed a man
And you'll never get to spend the gold with the blood upon your hands
The cabin's covered now with snow and shelves of food are bare
Satan's waitin' for me now and I'm too cold to care
Is that the devil at the door coming for my soul
Or is it just the old man a looking for his goldI fell head over heels in love with you last night
After all those Mr. Moms I found Mr. Right
I was just about to settle in
When I got those feelings again
the next thing that I knew,
I had on my walkin shoes.
[Chorus]
There I go again,
Wont somebody please help me?
This merry-go-round that Im on got me weak in the knees
running from the kind of love I wanted to fall in
I dont know where how why what or when
But there I go again
Ive tried therapy, psychology and wine
They all tell me theres a cure for my state of mind
but they dont know what theyre talking about
Cause when I work, Im working things out
could my diagnosis be theres nothing wrong with me
[Chorus]
There I go again,
Wont somebody please help me?
This merry-go-round that Im on got me weak in the knees
running from the kind of love I wanted to fall in
I dont know where how why what or when
But there I go again
In Situations full of complications
Through the edge of reason,
I think I found my destination
There I go,
[Chorus]
There I go again,
Wont somebody please help me?
This merry-go-round that Im on got me weak in the knees
running from the kind of love I wanted to fall in
I dont know where how why what or when
But there I go again
No, I dont know where how why what or when
But there I go again
There I GoThis ol' smoke filled bar is somethin' I'm not used to
But I gave up my home to see you satisfied
And I just called to let you know where I'll be livin'
Well, it's not much but I feel welcome here inside
And I've got swinging doors, a jukebox and a barstool
And my new home has a flashing neon sign
Stop by and see me anytime you want to
'Cause I'm always here at home till closing time
I've got everything I need to drive me crazy
I've got everything it takes to lose my mind
And in here, the atmosphere's just right for heartaches
Thanks to you, I'm always here till closing time
And I've got swinging doors, a jukebox and a barstool
And my new home has a flashing neon sign
Stop by and see me anytime you want to
'Cause I'm always here at home till closing timeWhen I'm cryin' just cryin' over what we've become
That's not but cry though I look there on the demage that we've done
We can start here not parted for there's hope for me and you
If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do
If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do
My heart tells me to forget her and I'll forget him too
I'll take a step in your direction and toward you I'll take too
If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do
[ steel ]
It's not rain it's just pain runnin' down my face
I feel certain that's a hurtin' won't leave any trace
We'll erase it just replace it with a love we once knew
If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do
If we put our heads...She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
No matter where I go, no matter who I see
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
Though she said goodbye and set me free
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
I can't talk about her 'cause she's with someone new
'Cause while she was with me, she was true, true, true
Should have done right when I had my day
Now I'm all alone and I'm havin' to pay
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
Guess I had it comin' 'cause she set me free
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She was a sweet, sweet girl to me
I can't talk about her 'cause she's with someone new
'Cause while she was with me, she was true, true, true

She was a sweet, sweet girl to meRamblin' rose ramblin' rose why you ramble no one knows
Wild and wind blown that's how you've grown who can cling to a ramblin' rose
Ramble on ramble on when you're ramblin' days are gone
Who will love you with a love true when you're ramblin' days are gone
Ramblin' rose ramblin' rose why I want you heaven knows
Though I love you with a love true but who can cling to a ramblin' rose
Ramblin' rose ramblin' rose why I want you heaven knows
Though I love you with a love true but who can cling to a ramblin' roseThey say you stand by your man
Tell me something I don't understand
You said you love me and that's a fact
And then you left me, said you felt trapped
Well some things you can't explain away
But the heartache's with me to this day
Did you stand by me?
No not at all
Did you stand by me?
No way
All the times that we were close,
I remember these things the most
I've seen my dreams come tumbling down
I can't be happy without you around
So alone I keep the wolves at bay
And there's only one thing I can say
Did you stand by me?
No not at all
Did you stand by me?
No way
So explain why this must be
Did you lie when you spoke to me?
Did you stand by me?
No not at all
Did you stand by me?
No way
I got a job but it don't pay
I need new clothes,
Somewhere to stay
Hey without these things I can do
But without your love
I can't make it through
But if you don't understand
My point of view
Then there's not a damn thing I can do
Did you stand by me?
No not at all
Did you stand by me?
No wayUsed to sleep through the night peacefully
Not a care in the world got to me
But now I lay me down to sleep
I'm afraid of what I might see
I wake up screamin' when your dream goes by
Used to feel like a man in control
Unaware of the storm in my soul
The sight of you took away my breath
I wake up screamin' when your dream goes by
Now in this dream I'm in a room
All dressed up just like a groom
Watchin' shadows dance in the ledge
Suddenly you then appear you whisper in my hear
And I jump right over the edge
Just a dream that I seem to recall
Can't you tell me which doctor to call
Tell him please I'm not feelin too well
Everynight I'm hearin' wedding bells
I wake up screamin' when your dream goes byWHEN THE BOOK OF LIFE IS READ
Writer Hank Williams
In Life's many battles that you will have to fight
Just stay close to Jesus and journey in His light
Then on that judgement morning when all pain has fled
You'll stand in God's Kingdom, When The Book Of Life Is Read.
When the seals are broken and names are read aloud
You'll see many loved ones [tandin' in the crowd
So brother keep on prayin' and follow where you're lead
You'll stand in God's Kingdom, When The Book Of Life Is Read.
All your dreams of heaven will come true on that day
When the sky shall open and this earth melt away
Then all God's faithful children will raise up from the dead
United in God's Kingdom, When The Book Of Life Is Read.
What a happy feelin' to know He'll always care
And when our work is over heaven with Him we'll share
There's be no pain or sorrow, no tears will e'er be shed
When we stand there in God's Kingdom and The Book Of Life Is Read.There's a gonna be smooth sailin' from now on cause my cheatin' baby's gone
Diamond rings I can't afford so I threw her overboard smooth sailin' from now on
Well I've satisfied my hanker and I've got somebody new

Smooth sailin' from now on

Will break any minute
Oh but you are so-oh free
I'll get up and walk away
I won't stay to see you leave me

Think what I say
I mean business
I mean business
I mean business
I mean businessI've been living in this town, for quite sometime
It's been eighteen years since I crossed that county line
I sold almost everything that was mine
Now I'm leaving town, with nothing but that bottom line
A hundred dollars and a half of a tank of gas
The shirt that's on my back, and an beat up Rangers cap
200 miles to go, who would believe that,
I would go this far, without turning back
Chorus:
So Here I go, packing light to head down that road
And I know, this life I'll lead will beat on my soul
But I'll still have my pride
Nothing But That Bottom Line
The bands been on the road now, for quite sometime
Hitting all the cities, neon sign to neon sign
Drowning in straight bourbon whiskey, beer and too much wine
Playing our songs for nothing but that bottom line
But on that stage each night, were captured by the sound
Singing these songs we write, to a different town
'Cause there are people who believe in what we've found
They like the song we sing and that's why we hang around
So Here I go, packing light to head down that road
And I know, this life I'll lead will beat on my soul
But I'll still have my pride
Nothing But That Bottom Line
Thirty Years from now on that marquee sign
You'll see our name lit up misspelled, and live tonight
But we don't care, cause we play music that we like
Almost for free, for nothing but that bottom line
So Here I go, packing light to head down that road
And I know, this life I'll lead will beat on my soul
But I'll still have my pride
Nothing But That Bottom Line
So Here I go, packing light to head down that road
And I know, this life I'll lead will beat on my soul
But I'll still have my pride
Nothing But That Bottom LineI'm rollin' rollin' rollin' in the sunshine of your sweet sweet love
So many loves left me in darkness I'd lock my heart and slept alone at night
But when you smiled a window opened
In poured the sun you were the one who let him to light
And now I'm rollin' in your sweet sweet sunshine
In a dream I never dreamed of dreaming of
Well I'm rollin' in your sweet sweet sunshine
Rollin' in the heaven of your sweet sweet love
Your love peeked in like early morning and softly took the shadows from my mind
Gone were the doubts the dark suspicions
Your gentle ways made better days so easy to find
And now I'm rollin' in...
And now I'm rollin' in...Who cares for fame or fortune
Who cares for wealth or gold
Because I find a fortune
Within my arms I hold
A tiny turned up nose
Two cheeks just like a rose
So sweet from head to toes
That little boy of mine
Two arms that hold me tight
Two eyes that shine so bright
Two lips that kiss goodnight
That little boy of mine
No one will ever know
Just what his coming has meant
Because I love him so
He's something heaven has sent
He's all the world to me
He climbs upon my knee
To me he'll always be
That little boy of mine
And when he lays his head
Upon his pillow so white
I pray the Lord above
To guide him safe through the night
In dreams I see his face
And feel his fond embrace
There's no one can replace
That little boy of mine.I feel so sorry for my friends, now, that you'd left me
I just don't have the time to see them like I used to do
I know they worry but each night I hurry
To get home to my memories of you
I've got so many, I've not lost any
Like treasure packed away they get me through
To fit my sad time, I just go through my mind
And pick out the perfect memory of you
I don't feel lonely anymore that's what they don't see
There's so many happy thoughts of you that I can use
It's not real life but I know you're still mine
When I'm goin' through my memories of you
I've got so many, I've not lost any
Like treasure packed away they get me through
To fit my sad time, I just go through my mind
And pick out the perfect memory of youThe words of a love song just like a love letter will send your heart's message along
So if you're not gifted to make pretty speeches just sing her a pretty love song
Sing her a love song that tells her you love her don't keep her waiting too long
If you can't say what's your heart wants to tell her just sing her a pretty love song
[ steel - guitar ]
Just call her your darling and tell her you love her a kiss or two wouldn't be wrong
If you can't say how you feel when you hold her just sing her a pretty love song
Sing her a love song...WITH THE POZO SECO SINGERS

Ribbon of darkness over me
Since my true love walked out the door
Tears I never had before
Ribbon of darkness over me
Clouds are gathering over my head
That kill the day and hide the sun
That shroud the night when day is done
Ribbon of darkness over me
Rain is falling on the meadow
Where once my love and I did lie
Now she is gone from the meadow
My love goodbye
Ribbon of darkness over me
Where once the world was young as spring
Where flowers did bloom and birds would sing
Ribbon of Darkness over me
In this cold room lying
Don't want to see no one but you
Lord, I wish I could be dying
To forget you
How I wish your old heart could see
How mine just takes and breaks all day
Come on back and take away
Ribbon of Darkness over me
Come on back and take away
Ribbon of Darkness over meI'm tired of watching me hurt you
I'm tired of being the teardrops on your face
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
I know your every weakness
I can find one in everything you say
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm not the one that you really need
I'm not the one in your dreams
I can see it in your eyes
This ain't the way it should feel
I don't know how we got here
Love's no longer blind
If that's just how it is
Can we go on like this
Oh, baby what do you say
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
I'll set your heart free
And if you're mine
You'll come flying back some day
But I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
Well I'm taking you with me
Like a room in my heart
You will have your place
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm not the one that you really need
I'm not the one in your dreams
I can see it in your eyes
This ain't the way it should feel
I don't know how we got here
Love's no longer blind
If that's just how it is
Can we go on like this
Oh, baby what do you say
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this wayI know that you've been foolin' round on me right from the start
So I'll take back my ring and I'll take back my heart
When you're tired of foolin' round with 2-0-3
Come on home and fool around with me
I wasn't foolin' round the day I said I'd do
Many a nights I wished that I've been foolin' too
I know it's foolish taking all this misery when it's you a fool I'll always be
I know that you've been foolin' round on me right from the start
So honey fool around you'll know right where I'm at
Don't worry if I'm lonesome cause I'm used to that
And when you're tired of foolin' round with 2-0-3
Come on home and fool around with me
I know that you've been foolin' roundIf the angels have sweethearts then I want you for mine
I'd be a tramp and sleep in the street or I'd be a beggar with rags on my feet
If I knew for sure when the time comes to part
Someday in heaven you'd be my sweetheart
Will there be sweethearts in heaven after we've crossed the line
If the angels have sweethearts then I want you for mine
(If I should go first and leave you behind to face life alone bear this in mind
I'll be a waitin' if heaven's my fate
To take you by the hand just inside the pearly gates)
Will there be sweetheartsOh they tell me of a place and they tell me of a day
Where the saints shall be gathered to stay
They shall come from the east they shall come from the west
Whe we gather on that roundup day
When it's roundup time in heaven and our travels on earth are on
All the friends that day has served shall gather on that golden shore
Twill be sweet when we meet at Jesus feet
With no heartaches no pains no sigh
When they're on heaven's plains will they find your name
At the great roundup in the sky
Twill be sweet when we meet...I can't sleep at night for all the commotion
My heart beat the hell out of our devotion
Tied up and tied down, cried out of my mind
Crazy to love you, crazy still to care
Black circles under my eyes
You run circles around those other girls guys
Otherwise a woman would wake up and start a war
Why be blue anymore?
[Chorus]
Why be blue over you?
Why be blue over you?
(Why be blue?)
Life is too short to spend in tears
Save something sweet for the not-so-tender years
Try not to cry much, oh when it's over
Goodbye to you, and goodbye to heartache too
[Chorus]
Should have seen it coming, should have seen the signs
Would have been better off if you'd never ever been mine
Otherwise a woman woke up and walked out the door
Why be blue anymore?

Track 5
"Riding With Inmate Jerome"
Parody of David Ball's "Riding With Private Malone"
Enjoy
I was just out of the rehab rolling through the neighborhood
When I came across this homeboy
Said he'd fix me up real good
He led me down an alley
And right through a chain link fence
I had a hundred dollars I could spend
It was parked out in the driveway at a house of ill-repute
And in the back seat hung a double breasted lime green suit
What that homeboy showed me nearly caused a heart attack
For what he called a hooptie was a sky blue Cadillac
And I felt a little nervous as I drove out of the hood
But I loved that furry steering wheel
And that dashboard made of wood
I opened up the mini bar and in there I found a note
The stationery said County Jail and this is what he wrote
He said my nizzame is inmate Leroy Jerome
And if youse readin this judge says I isn't coming home
Though I am incarcerated I'll make a deal with you
If you can keep my gals in line this car belongs to you
Now ride low
And drive slow
And make her yours own
You'll always be riding with Inmate Jerome
The grill on the radiator was gold and shiny bright
And I'd tell you those old curb feelers were handy late at night
I get the feeling sometimes if I turn real quick I'd see
A gold-toothed cat daddy in the seat right next to me
One night I was hoppin and when I heard the breaking glass
And I can still remember the sounds of bullets whizzin' past
Someone said they saw a man in a fur coat and fur hat
Push me out of the motorcar and take his Caddy back
It was a young man named inmate Leroy Jerome
He's out of the joint the parole board sent him home
Yes he was incarcerated...but he cut a deal or two
Now he's got a brand new pinky ring and new Bruno Malli shoes
Hey I think I caught a whiff of Michael Jordan's splash cologne
I sho nuff of riding with inmate JeromeWill the roses bloom where she lies sleeping
Will the flowers shed their pedals there
Will the dewdrops fall upon the roses
Where my darling sleeps beneath the sand
Her lips were like a bunch of roses
Her eyes were like the starlit sky
Her hair was dark and it was curly
I'll miss her till the day I die
I miss my darling she is sleeping
Underneath the beautiful sky
I miss her now since she has left me
I will miss her til the day I dieHello stranger
Put your loving hand in mine
You are a stranger
And you're a friend of mine
Get up, rounder
Let a working girl lay down
You are a rounder
And you're all out and down
Every time
I ride the four and six street cars
I can see my baby
Peeping through the bars
He bowed his head
And he waved both hands at me
He's prison bound
And longing to be free
I'll see you
When your troubles are like mine
Yes I'll see you
When you haven't got a dimeJust blew through another red light
But the cop on the corner was sippin' his coffee
The speed limit might say 35
But 65 is where he woulda clocked me
On the way picking up my baby
She's sitting on the front porch waitin'
And when I get there don't you know
Gonna get in the truck-n-
Roll like the Mississippi
Slow like sipping on whiskey'
Go 'round the world on a country road
And who knows where we might end up
Lord knows we're gonna have a sho nuff
Good time no matter where we go
When we get in the truck-n-roll, roll
Just gimme four wheels and a little two-lane
My baby's gonna be my little wildflower
And gimme that radio playin' George Strait
Cause I know she'll wanna turn it up louder
Where the black top winds through the pastures
I'll be takin' those right curves faster
Cause I want that pretty girl sittin' real close
When we get in the truck-n-
Roll like the Mississippi
Slow like sipping on whiskey
Go 'round the world on a country road
And who knows where we might end up
Lord knows we're gonna have a sho nuff
Good time no matter where we go
When we get in the truck-n-roll
Somewhere we might pull off
Out there where the whippoorwill calls
Grab a sleepin' bag if that's what she wants
And let it unroll while we're sippin' on whiskey
And take it slow like the Mississippi
When we get in the truck-n-
Roll like the Mississippi
Slow like sipping on whiskey
Go 'round the world on a country road
And who knows where we might end up
Lord knows we're gonna have a sho nuff
Good time no matter where we go
When we get in the truck-n-roll
When we get in the truck-n-roll
Hop up in the truck-n-roll, yeahI'm a walkin' the dog and I'm never blue
I'm a walkin' the dog ain't thinkin' bout you
I don't need no one to tie me down I'm a walkin' the dog and paintin' town
Such an easy life I never knew since the day that I left you
I'm a carefree lad and I've seen the light
And I'm a walkin' the dog all day and all night
[ fiddle - steel ]
Such an easy life...
And I'm a walkin' the dog all day and all nightI can't get over the way you got over me (so soon)
You just turned your back and then you walked away
I get my all to show my love was true (for you)
You'll never know how much I'm missing you
Oh I've got to learn how to learn how to get over you
Poor little me I loved you too much too long
I can't get over the way you got over me (so soon)
You just turned your back and then you walked away
[ piano ]
Oh I've got to learn...
You just turned your back and then you walked away ( you walked away)His eyes are cold and restless
And His wounds have almost healed
And she'd give half of Texas
Just to change the way he feels
'Cause she knows his love's in Tulsa
And she knows he's gonna go
But it ain't no woman flesh and blood
It's that damned old rodeo
Well it's bulls and blood
It's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles
The gold in his buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps
It's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins
And the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo
She does her best to hold him
When his love comes to call
But his need for it controls him
And her back's against the wall
And it's "So long girl, I'll see you."
When it's time for him to go
You know the woman wants her cowboy
Like he wants his rodeo
Well, it's bulls and blood
It's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in the knuckles
The gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps
It's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins
And the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo
It'll drive a cowboy crazy
It'll drive the man insane
And he'll sell off everything he owns
Just to pay to play her game
And a broken home and some broken bones
Is all he'll have to show
For all the years that he spent chasin'
This dream they call rodeo
Well, it's bulls and blood
It's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in them knuckles
The gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps
It's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins
And the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo
It's the broncs and the blood
It's the steers and the mud
And they call the thing rodeoOne look at you
And just look at me
Held under your spell
So helplessly
Yes I'm still your fool
Any fool can see
One look at you
And just look at me
I thought I'd be over you by now
But I guess it's too soon
The truth was so plain to see
Tonight when you walked in the room
I just couldn't control the tears
When I saw you again
My love is still as strong for you
As it's ever been
One look at you
And just look at me
Held under your spell
So helplessly
Yes I'm still your fool
Any fool can see
One look at you
And just look at me
I'm still your fool
Guess I'll always be
One look at you
And just look at meLast call for alcohol
I'm finally through with you
It's too late to go home early
And the crowd is thin and fast
I swear to God the next drink I take
It's gonna be my last
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired
Still not over you
I've gotta find me a better chaser
To chase away these blues
Last call for alcohol
I'm finally through with you
My hung head tung bed good for nothing
A little ? might saw through
Tryna drink you out of my mind
Was more than I could do
Last call for alcohol
I'm finally through with you
They say I can keep on drinking
I just can't do it here
But I drunk myself from sober
To a-crying in my bed
Is it a lover or a liver
I really need the most?
I'm tired of thinking with the wrong head
This will be my final toast
Last call for alcohol
I'm finally through with you
My hung head tung bed good for nothing
A little ? might saw through
Tryna drink you out of my mind
Was more than I could do
Last call for alcohol
I'm finally through with youWell now it takes more than a robin to make the winter go
I know it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow
Well it takes two hearts a cooking to make a fire grow
And baby you've got what it takes
Yeah you know it takes a lot of kisses to make a romance sweet
Uh it takes a lot of lovin' honey to make my life complete
I done told you it takes a lot of woman to knock me off my feet
But baby you've got what it takes
Well I said uh huh and I said uh huh
You know you've got just what it takes
It takes more than an effort to make me stay away from you
And it takes more than one lifetime to prove that I'll be true
But it takes somebody special honey to make me say I do
And baby you've got what it takes
Come on baby I said uh huh yeah uh huh
You know you've got just what it takes
Well it takes more than an effort to make me stay away from you
And it takes more than a lifetime honey to prove that I'll be true
And it takes somebody awful special to make me say I do
Baby you've got what it takes
And baby you've got what it takes
And baby you've got what it takesGive me a ticket for an airplane cause I ain't got a time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone I'm a going home my baby just wrote me a letter
I don't care how much money I got to spend cause I got to get back to my baby again
Lonely days are gone I'm a going home my baby just wrote me a letter
Well he wrote me a letter said he couldn't live without me no more
Hey listen Mister can't you see I've got to get back to my baby once more
Give me a ticket for an airplane...
Well he wrote me a letter...
My baby just wrote me a letter my baby just wrote me a letterRaeleen wheeler was the first girl I loved
Through the last year of high school, we were thicker than blood
Holed up in Mississippi, and starvin' for fun
We made love and dreamed up places to run
I was burnin' that summer with the big dreams I had
And the songs I'd written, well, the world needed bad
But a pretty girl needs more comfort and gold
Than a beat-up black notebook is likely to hold
Hey, Raelene, it's a wide world between pearl river and the bright L.A. lights
And if I'd done it all without dreamin' I'd still be in Jackson tonight
Hollywood hopefuls ain't an endangered breed
But luck is like lightnin', and it sure struck me
The hit songs, the women, the standing-room halls
And twenty years of hard labor, holdin' on to it all
Louisiana i-20 headed east from Monroe
A bus bound for Jackson and a homecoming show
Staring through the dark glass at the flat miles beyond
Tryin' not to look at a face that is gone
Hey, Raelene, a wife at 19, but I heard you made out all right
And every now and again, I wonder are you somewhere in Jackson tonight
Well, we killed 'em, we crushed 'em, burned the place to the ground
And in the dressing room quiet, I was still coming down
When in the doorway appeared an old flame, full-grown
Looking pretty as ever, and entirely alone
She said the divorce nearly broke her, she was learning to stand
And as she talked it came clearer that she wanted a hand
So I drew her close to me, and I kissed my sweet rae
And the miles and the memories just melted away
Then I glanced in the mirror, and in a split second's time
Just before recognizing that old face as mine
I saw a strange, sad man in a cheap rhinestone shirt
And a woman he held onto like his last hope on earth
He was worn and trod down as the road he'd been on
And his eyes were half-dead, lookin' too hard, too long
His life measured in nights that flashed and grew dim
Leaving no one really happy, least of all him
Then the loading gate slammed, and I let my arms fall
We traded numbers, small talk, promised to call
And as she faded from me, and the night closed around
I picked up a black notebook and I let it spill down
Hey, Raelene, it's a long way between the wantin' and the makin' it right
And if I was the one that you needed I'd never leave Jackson tonight
(Tag) yeah, if I had it all to do over I'd still be in Jackson tonightA couple inches taller
Another size smaller
A little curl in my hair
Used to wish I was older
Now I wish I was younger
Back when I didn't have a care
Most of the time I am happy with what God gave me
Once in a while I wish that some miracle would change me
[Chorus]
I'm OK with the way God made me
I have my days but doesn't everybody
It's not always easy for me to believe in myself
But I gotta remember
I'm always gonna be a better me than anybody else
And God doesn't make mistakes
Mama says I'm special
Calls me her little angel
Yeah, I could almost do no wrong
But I trip and I stumble
Guess that's what keeps you humble
But I pick myself up and I carry on
I'll never be a flawless model of perfection
Nobody's perfect and I admit I'm no exception
[Chorus]Seems I always have to slip around
To be with you, my dear
Slippin' around
Afraid we might be found
I know I can't forget you
And I've got to have you near
But we just have to slip around
And live in constant fear
Though you're tied up with someone else
And I'm all tied up too
I know I've made mistakes, dear
But I'm so in love with you
I hope some day I'll find the way
To bring you back with me
Then I won't have to slip around
To have your company
Though you're tied up with someone else
And I'm all tied up too
I know I've made mistakes, dear
But I'm so in love with you
I hope some day I'll find the way
To bring you back with me
Then I won't have to slip around
To have your companyCity sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's
A feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear
Silver bells, silver bells
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling
Hear them ring, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all the bustle you'll hear
Silver bells, silver bells
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling
Hear them ring, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
Soon it will be Christmas day(Jo-El Sonnier/Judy Ball)
I've never once in my life met someone like you
I don't know what the word blue means
As long as I'm with you
You fill me so completely through everything you do
Blue is not a word at all
As long as I'm with you
Most of the time in my past
Blue is all I knew
But now that we're together
O' how I love you
I'm so glad I've found you
You've made my dreams come true
Blue is not a word at all
As long as I'm with you
Most of the time in my past
Blue is all I knew
But now that we're together
O' how I love you
I'm so glad I've found you
You've made my dreams come true
Blue is not a word at all
As long as I'm with you(Dolly Parton)
Many years you have lingered around my cabin door
Oh hard times come again no more
Oh hard times come again no more
Oh hush a bye hard times, go ye away
Cause my hungry baby wants a Gingerbread Cake
Not a cow in the barn yard no money to spend
Not an egg in the hayloft, no little red hen
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for
There's a wolf at the door with an angry
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times
And the cupboard is bare
Oh, hush a bye hard times go ye to rest
Cause my ragged baby wants a new ruffled dress
And she wants some new shoes with buckles to wear
And she wants some silver bows for her golden hair
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for
There's a wolf at the door with an angry
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times
And the cupboard is bare
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for
There's a wolf at the door with an angry
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times
And the cupboard is bare
Hush a bye hard times go ye away
I don't intend to be treated this way
So, hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Don't cry no more
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Come ye no more
Many years you have lingered around my cabin door
Hush a bye hard times
Come ye no more
Hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Don't cry no more
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Come ye no moreIt's good to see you, so good to see you
Oh, how I've missed you since I've been gone
I've crossed the ocean, traveled through many lands
And it's good to see you to be in your home
There's something in me that makes me wander
There's many a land I have to see
And when I'm far away in a land of strangers
I know my good friends think on me
It's good to see you, so good to see you
Oh, how I've missed you since I've been gone
'Cause I've crossed the ocean, traveled through many lands
And it's good to see you, to be in your home
Oh, it's a wonder when it comes to friendship
No matter how far away, no matter how long
There's a constant thread that's never broken
And it ties me to, my friends at homeLife ain't always beautiful
Sometimes it's just plain hard
Life can knock you down
It can break your heart.
Life ain't always beautiful
You think you're on your way
And it's just a dead end road
At the end of the day.
But the struggles make you stronger
And the changes make you wise
And happiness has it's own way
Of taking it's own sweet time.
No, life ain't always beautiful
Tears will fall sometimes
Life ain't always beautiful
But it's a beautiful ride.
Life ain't always beautiful
Some days I miss your smile
I get tired of walking
All these lonely miles.
And wish for just one minute
That I could see your pretty face
Guess, I can dream
But life don't work that way.
But the struggles make me stronger
And the changes make me wise
And happiness has it's own way
Of taking it's sweet time.
No, life ain't always beautiful
But I know I'll be fine
Life ain't always beautiful
But it's a beautiful ride.
What a beautiful rideWalkin' off the highway I'd been tryin' to catch a ride hungry and thirsty as a bear
Not a penny in my pockets and I'd ran out of pride
So I thought I'd try to bum myself a beer
When up stopped a wellknown posse starin' down at me
A big old shiny badge pinned on his vest
He said if you ain't got no money and you ain't got no job
Boy I'm placing you under arrest
Or you can get out of town before sundown and don't you never come back
Take your tambourine and your guitar string and move on down the track
Don't like the way that you comb your hair the way you drawl you all
And if you're not out of town before sundown you won't get out of town at all
Well I hitchhiked down to Phoenix I was following the sun
Prettiest place I think I've ever seen I met a sweet young lady but how was I to know
That pretty thing was only seventeen
Then I saw the red lights gleamin' and I heard the sirenes screamin'
A sound that fills the bravest hearts with fear
And that old sheriff didn't stutter when to me those words he uttered
Boy don't let the sun set on you here
You better get out of town before sundown...Today pain became a real life's hurtin' thing
And the choir of loneliness sang me a song
Now I know just what it means to lose a lifetime dreams
Cause today I can feel it touching home
No longer do I wonder why men have lost their minds
And wind up in a jungle of flashing neon signs
Now I know just how long a man can last when love is gone
Cause today I can feel it touching home
[ steel ]
No longer do I wonder why...
Yes today I can feel it touching home(My arms) keep reaching for you
(My lips) keep calling for you
(My shoes keep walking back to you)
I must say that I don't care hold my head up in the air
Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call
But when the day is through my heartache starts anew
And that's when I miss you most of all
And my arms keep reaching for you my eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you and my shoes keep walking back to you
[ strings ]
No matter how much I pretend I wish I had you back again
For nothing else means half as much as you
Our old world just seemed to die the day you said goodbye
And I can't forget no matter what I do
And my arms keep reaching for you...
(My arms my eyes my lips keep calling for you)
My shoes keep walking back to youI'm just driftwood on the river floating down the tide
I don't care where this old river carries me
I keep drifting just because my heart is broken inside
And I'm tired of wishing for what cannot be
I may meet some little driftwood lost as same as I
Share a handshake and a tender tear or two
But it's always good luck how we got to say goodbye
I must wander on to keep my randezvous
Though I drift through town and city I can never stay
For I find no place to call my home sweet home
I don't ask for help or pitty I just go my way
All I'm praying for is peace to dream alone
(I'm just driftwood on the river and I'm drifting on
'Till this weary river meets the deep blue sea)
Where the deep blue sea may help me to forget someone
Yes the careless one who has forgotten me
In my heart I don't feel bitter over what has been
I feel sorry for the one I must forget
And instead of being someone with the world to win
I'm just driftwood on the river of regretSanta baby, just slip a sable under the tree for me
Been an awful good girl, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue
I'll wait up for you dear, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'd check off my Christmas list
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot (a lot)
Been an angel all year, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight, tonight
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me too
Santa cutie, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring
I don't mean a phone, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
HurryYou've got your Texas way of walking
You've got your sexy way of talking
I let you get all under my skin
But now your welcome has worn awful thin
And so, now, it's time you go
Don't come back again
Cause your train don't stop here any more
I ain't your gas-up, rest-stop swinging door
You can't just walk in
Walk out like so many times before
I ain't your swinging door
You've got a girl in every cow town
You think I don't know how you cad around
I let your sweet talk in, my guard down
Took me a while to figure you out
But I've got you
Figured all out now
And your train don't stop here any more
I ain't your gas-up, rest-stop swinging door
You can't just drop in
Drop out like so many times before
I ain't your swinging door
You'd best make up your mind
Cause if you go
You ain't coming back this time
Your train don't stop here any more
I ain't your quick-stop, lock up, open twenty-four
You can't just drop in, drop out
Treat me like your candy store
Cause your train don't stop here any more
I ain't your gas-up, rest-stop swinging door
You can't just walk in
Walk out like so many times before
I ain't your swinging door
I ain't your swinging doorYou see I'm always talkin'
When I should be drivin'
But everybody does it these days
You say I'm gettin' cancer
Every time I answer
Yeah, whatever you say
Wish I could change my service
Should have never signed up
Heck it never works anyway
The signal's always breakin'
I can't hear nothin'
Hey, what did you say?
I know you can't hear me
There ain't no use in listenin'
I can't tell what you're sayin'
All I hear is hissin'
Yeah, the more that I roam
The more I gotta pay
I'm on my cell phone
What the *$@# did you say?
I ought to get a beeper
It be a whole lot cheaper
Just throw this cell phone in the lake
I'd really love to call you
But even when I get through
It's always what did you say?
Can anybody hear me?
Or am I just wastin' minutes?
I'm in 1500
750 was my limit
Hey, I gotta go
I can't hear you anyway
I'm on my cell phone
What the *$@# did you say?
Oh, the more that I roam
The more I gotta pay
I'm on my cell phone
What the *$@# did you say?A bad little boy moved into the neighborhood
He don't do nothin' right, just sits around and looks so good
He don't wanna go to school to learn to read and write
He just sits around the house and listens to the records all night
Well, he puts those tacks on teacher's chair
Put some gum on lil' girl's hair
Now junior, behave yourself
He buys every rock 'n' roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime he gets, he is off to the jukebox man
He worries the teacher till at night she's a-ready to poop
From rockin and a rollin and a spinnin and a hula-hoop
Well, his rock 'n' roll has gotta stop
Junior's head is hard to rock
Now junior, behave yourself, rock hard
I'm gonna tell your mama, you better do what she said
And get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
You took the canary and fed it to the neighbor's cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a hot a-bath in laundromat
Well, his mama said he's gotta stop
Junior's head is hard to rock
Now junior, behave yourselfTook the Continental Trailways
'Cause I didn't have the fare
To get from Cincinnati to Los Angeles by air
The guy who said he'd meet me
In a shiny limousine
With a contract in his pocket
Turned out to be a queen
He could not see my body
Or appreciate my good looks
Had I fallen for some story
That I read in all of the books
But I ain't
Goin' back
To the bottom side of the tracks
No, No, and I ain't
Goin' back
To the bottom side of the tracks
No I ain't goin' back
To Cincinnati
So I got myself an agent
With a roll of dollar bills
And a Beverly type mansion
In the middle of the hills
I was friendly with producers
And was heading out with the stars
I played the backseat heroine
In a thousand different cars
From Cavalier to Playboy
To the Johnny Carson show
To holding up some dogfood
For a firm in Idaho
I've a screen-test every weekend
And I'm constantly on call
I'll be twenty-five next summer
And thirty-five next fall
But I ain't
Goin' back
To the bottom side of the track
No, No, and I ain't
Goin' back
To the bottom side of the track
You'll never get me to go back
Ain't goin' back
To CincinnatiI've walked a million miles across this floor and a million times I opened this door
But all there ever is the blues hm it's lonesome without you
I know we just broke up two days ago but it seems a million years or so
To get you back there's nothing I want do hm it's lonesome without you
If I could count high enough I'd let you know
How many times I wished that you'd walk through that door
And love me as only you can do hm it's lonesome without you
If I could count high enough
Oh love me as only you can do hm it's lonesome without youYou don't have to cry when I say goodbye, goodbye
You know I'll be coming back real soon
And when I do, you know
It will be such a sweet hello
Rising like the sun above the sky line, sky line
Love is brighter than ever before
And that should be understood
When I said "I do," you knew I would
Some things can be good forever
My love tells me so
Two hearts can be one together
My love tells me so
Let me lay your head upon my pillow, baby
Whisper what you need to me, my dear (my dear)
Don't worry, close your eyes
Morning will find me by your side
Some things can be good forever
My love tells me so
Two hearts can be one together
My love tells me so
Give me a chance and I'll sing for you
I have a song for you
To be with you is a dream
I dream of you
Some things can be good forever
My love tells me soI am a poor wayfaring stranger
While traveling through this world of woe
Yet there's no sickness, toil or danger
In that bright world yo which I go
I'm going there to see my father
I'm going there no more to ram
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home
I know dark clouds will gather around me
I know my way is rough and steep
Yet beauteous fields lie just before me
Where God's redeemed their vigils keep
I'm going there to my mother
She said she'd meet me when I come
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over meWhen I sing for him oh praise God's holy name I can feel his presence in my soul
When I sing for him oh blessed be his name how I rejoice within when I sing for him
As I sing a melody that he gave when I speak God's name in song or kneel to pray
Oh I have a special feeling deep within when I sing for him
When I sing for him in person hallelujah when I look to my new home hallelujah
Oh the angels will be singing hallelujah amen when I sing for him when I sing for him(Melinda Melinda) oh how I miss Melinda
While a walking down a street in Denver I passed by a little dress shop
A sign on the door read Melinda's and I asked myself if I should stop
For I knew a girl named Melinda when I lived here years ago
And I wondered if by chance it could be the Melinda I used to know
So I peeked in through the window and there to my surprise
I saw my darling Melinda and a tear came to my eyes
For she looked lovely as always as I watched her standing there
Her face was like an angel's with a halo of golden hair
Melinda Melinda with the golden hair oh how I miss Melinda (Melinda)
Then I slowly remembered how she suffered the shame
Of being left with a baby and me never changing her name
So I ran in and called out Melinda so ashamed I hung down my head
But the young girl said sir I'm sorry but you see my mother is dead
Melinda Melinda with the golden hair oh how I miss Melinda oh how I miss MelindaWhen I wake up every morning you're the first thing that I see
And like a new day that is dawning I feel the warmth come over me
I can face the world a courage I can make it through the day
Cause I know your love comes with me standin' by me all the way
Oh what a beautiful way to live just givin' you all the love can give
Oh what a wonderful thing to see that you don't want nobody but me
[ guitar ]
I don't know how I'm deservin' to be blessed with all these things
Like the sweet love you keep servin' and the happiness it brings
I don't worry bout tomorrow way I always used to do
Cause tomorrow I'll be sharin' for some yesterday with you
Oh what a beautiful way...
[ fiddle ]
Oh what a beautiful way...There's nothing left to tie us to each other anymore
The love we knew is gone and that's a fact we can't ignore
There's nothing left to loose ends on all the ties that bind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
There's no use in wasting the good years that we have left
When we might find happiness with somebody else
There's no chance for us we can see it we're not blind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
The blame belongs to both of us I guess we didn't try
Love is like a garden without care we let it die
The flower of love can't bloom if the sun don't ever shine
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
[ piano ]
The blame belongs to both of us...
Though it hurts we know we must leave it all behind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
You're wasting mine you're wasting mineSome people are taking vacation traveling both far and near
Ever stop and think about Jesus ever say him to have a care
It seems that I cannot be like them while on earth life's burdens I bear
And I prepare to meet Jesus and rest eternaly there
Yes someday I'll take a vacation one that never will end
When I'll cross old river Jordan my Saviour will welcome me in
For me the gates will swing open and I'll have a mansion within
There I will rest up in heaven a rest that never will end
[Guitar Interlude]
Yes some people own fine mansions some live in much luxury
Ever having a thought about Saviour of where they'll spend eternity
And though I cannot be like them I'm building my mansion on high
Yes someday I'll rest up in heaven and leave this old cruel world goodbye
Yes someday I'll take a vacation...Nothing's prettier than Rose is she's the sunshine of my day
Nothing's prettier than Rose is she's my everything to say
Rose has always been a plain me they say beauty once was her desire
Rose to me has so much altere one look in her eyes sets me on fire
Nothing's prettier than Rose is...
[ ac.guitar ]
Rose will always be my special one she got much more than I deserve
Rose will always be my morning sun she mends my strenght and gives me nerve
Nothing's prettier than Rose is...You say he don't treat you right
You say it ain't the same
Spends all his time playing your heart like it's just a game
He should've never let you go
Now I got a real good reason
To let you know I wanna hold you close and pick up the pieces
You don't have to be alone tonight
Why you sitting at home tonight
Waiting for him to call you up at midnight, drunk
To tell you that he wants you
Let's get out of town tonight
Get lost and found tonight
'Til you don't care let me love you right
Let's go somewhere where you and I
Can be all alone tonight
I wanna see your face
And whisper in your ear
I'm gonna say all the little things
You've been wanting to hear
You don't have to be alone tonight
Why you sitting at home tonight
Waiting for him to call you up at midnight, drunk
To tell you that he wants you
Let's get out of town tonight
Get lost and found tonight
'Til you don't care let me love you right
Let's go somewhere where you and I
Can be all alone tonight
Be all alone tonight
You don't have to be alone tonight
I want you for my own tonight
Girl you don't have to be alone tonight
Why you sitting at home tonight
Waiting for him to call you up at midnight, drunk
To tell you that he wants you
Let's get out of town tonight
Get lost and found tonight
'Til you don't care let me love you right
Let's go somewhere where you and I
Can be all alone tonight
Be all alone tonightTake me back to Anona street
Fill my glass again
With a bittersweet
Cause I don't wanna see
The life I have
Thought the next time around
Wouldn't be so bad
Same mistake that I made before
I'll be waking up
On the kinlin' floor
While the bells are ringing
So low and sad
Thought the next time around
Wouldn't be so bad
Same mistake that I made before
I'll be waking up
On the kinlin' floor
I remember how
I made you mad
Thought the next time around
Wouldn't be so bad
I Thought the next time around
Wouldn't be so bad
Thought the next time around
Wouldn't be so badMarigolds and tangerines
And lots of rusty window screens
Funny Paper, fountain pen
And patchwork things to cover in
Puppy dogs and potpourri
Oh won't you come and live with me
Tambourine and tape machine
And clippings from a magazine
No commitments, no demands
Just marmalade and music stands
Stay with me and spend some time
Just wish it so and we can rhyme
Scraps of paper, pot of glue
And I'll make funny things for you
Passing glance and passing touch
Understand not saying much
No beginning and no end
Come live with me and be my friendRain on my Sunday shoes
Pick up the daily news
Looks like tomorrows blues
But its better than none
Call on the telephone
Knowin' that he's not home
I'll put on the Rollin' Stones
And I can have me some fun
Start up a flight of stairs
Stand up and comb your hair
Try not to change things
More than you can withstand
Get into something new
That's made for a year or two
Pick up the pieces
Where you think they might land
Everyday goes
Another days gone
Hate to say so but I'm getting older
Day by day
Take off all your clothes
Stand up and wipe your nose
Cry for your daddy
Who died so long ago
Jump on another plane
Today it's all the same
You can catch me in Boston
'Cause that's how it goes
I'm here in apartment 21
Stop by and have some fun
Say how ya doin', ya old son of a gun
Look at a photograph
Lord, don't it make you laugh
For all these changes
What have you done?
La la la, la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la la
Sit down and write a song
Wait till the days grow long
And wait fir the autumn wind
To blow me away
La la la, la la la, la la la la

I'm beginning to say you don't love me at all
But you're still my baby I want the whole world to know
I just love you baby I love you so
Friends all try to tell me that I'm just a fool
Your love don't mean a thing
But I keep hopin' someday you'll see things in my way
We'll make the wedding bells ring
Then I'll have you you'll keep me gay we'll be alone both night and day
So tell everybody I want the whole world to know
I just love you baby I love you so
[ piano - guitar ]
Friends all try to tell me...Well I love you and I don't care who knows it
Thare ain't nothing that I wouldn't do show it
Well I'd climb upon the rooftops and I'd shout it
Hey I'd gladly tell the whole darn world about it
Well the Man in the Moon he's gonna see it and the fishes in the oceans gonna feel it
Well the birds and the bees are gonna hear it
And you can't make nothing out of that but love
Well I've heard love called a lot of things and sometimes it can turn into bad seeds
There's some say that it's just a waste of time
But it's too late now you've done blown my mind
And I love you and I don't care who knows it
There ain't nothin' that I wouldn't do show it
The birds and the bees already know it
And you can't make nothing out of that but love
No you can't make nothing out of that but loveTÃ¡ no meu paladar

E a minha alma te chama
Ah! Eu adoro amar vocÃª
Como eu te quero
Eu jamais quis
VocÃª me faz sonhar
Me faz realizar
Me faz crescer
Me faz feliz
O amor que existe
Entre nÃ³s dois
Ã tudo que eu sonhei
Pra mim
Ã mais do que paixÃ£o
Ã mais do que prazer
Amor que nÃ£o tem fim!

Lord it's busting my side
I've done all I can do to keep that woman happy
Still she's not satisfied
Hey hey Della Mae
Why do you treat me this way
Hey hey Della Mae
I'll get even some day
I'm the best hammer swinger on this big section gang
Big Bill Johnson is my name
Lord this hammer that I swing for a dollar and a half a day
I'll all for my Della Mae
Now I've been lots of places, not much I ain't done
There's still alot of things I'd like to see
Lord this hammer that I swing or the woman that I love
Yes, one's gonna be the death of meI don't want to be no patch on no quilt
(I just want to see...)
Tear-stained stitching linking memories to guilt
(I just want to see...)
I don't want to be no hair on no wall
(I just want to see...)
Blood-stained note saying fuck you all
(I just want to see what kills me)
Tommy, are you ready we better head to town
J.D.'s box is waiting to be lowered down
And you know how he hates to be kept waiting 'round
I don't want to be no chalk line drawing
(I just want to see...)
Toe-tagged question mark, until identifying
(I just want to see...)
I don't want to fuse with no economy seat
(I just want to see...)
Fuel some fireball at 30,000 feet
(I just want to see what kills me)
Tommy, did you catch his face
Before they closed the lid?
I swear I saw him wink once and flash me that old grin
Oh, you know, that would be just like him
I don't want to face no hollow-eyed ending
(I just want to see...)
Loved ones buried, empty days of waiting
(I just want to see what kills me)
Tommy, darling, come to bed
We'll try and sleep away this sadness
These memories, too, are bound to die
So our dreams will have to serve us
Tomorrow may be the day that our love betrays usI'm going out of my mind these days
Like I'm walking ?round in a haze
Can't think straight, can't concentrate
I need a shave
I go to work and I look tired
The boss says son you're gonna get fired
This ain't your style
And behind my coffee cup
I just smile
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing that I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
I can't get enough
Or stop this hunger for your love
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
This morning I put salt in my coffee
I put my shoes on the wrong feet
Losing my mind I swear
You might be the death of me
But I don't care
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing that I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
I can't get enough
Or stop this hunger for your love
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Is it your eyes, is it your smile
All I know is that you're driving me wild
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing that I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
I can't get enough
Or stop this hunger for your love
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm inHEARTS IN MY DREAM
Writers George Jones, Roger Miller
I dreamed that all the hearts I've broken came to visit me
And in my sleep they came to pay me for their misery
They were all so torn and shattered, Oh such tales of woe
It was I who caused them all and my conscience hurts me so
Hearts in my dream
Each one of them true
Each one loved me so
Each one I broke in two
My younger days were wild and reckless
Just love 'em and let 'em be
Those days are gone although it took a dream to make me see
Hearts in my dream
Each one of them true
Each one loved me so
Each one I broke in two
My younger days were wild and reckless
Just love 'em and let 'em be
Those days are gone although it took a dream to make me seeI got out walkin' after midnight
Out in the moonlight just like we used to do
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for you
I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that's just my way of sayin' I love you
I'm always walkin' after midnight searchin' for you
I stop to see a weepin' willow cryin' on her pillow
Maybe she's cryin' for me
And as the sky turns gloomy, night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be
I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the moonlight
Just hopin' you may be out there a walkin' after midnight searchin' for
me
I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that's just my way of sayin' I love you
I'm always walkin' after midnight searchin' for youAll your love lifting me higher
Than I ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
Then I'll be at your side forevermore
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
Now once I was downhearted
This little loneliness my foes and friend
But when you came, he soon departed
And he never showed his face again
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
I'm so glad I finally found you
Yes that one in a million girl
And now with my loving arms around you
I can stand up and face the world
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higherMy Father is all powerful and that you can't deny
A God of might and miracles it's written in the sky
It took a miracle to put the stars in place
It took a miracle to hang the world in space
But when he saved my soul cleansed and made me whole
It took a miracle of love and grace
The bible tells us of his pow'r and wisdom all way through
And every little bird and flow'r are testimonies too
It took a miracle...Lovers yes I guess I've had a few
I've played the game like lovers do in the night alone
Feelin's they never meant a thing to me
I never knew how love could be until you came along
You made a believer out of me I can see it I can feel it
You made a believer out of me how could I believe that it's not true after lovin' you
Forever was just a word I used to say
Love was just a game I played that ended with the dawn
Funny with all the love that I've been through
Now I know till I met you I never loved at all
You made a believer out of meSoftly and tenderly Jesus is calling, calling for you and for me
See on the portal he's waiting and watching, watching for you and for me
Come home come home ye who are weary come home
Earnestly tenderly Jesus is calling, calling oh sinner come home
Oh for the wonderful love he has promised, promised for you and for me
Though we have sinned he has mercy and pardon, pardon for you and for me
Come home come homePut your sweet lips a little closer to the phone.
Let's pretend that we're together, all alone.
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low,
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go.
Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true,
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know,
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?
You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man,
If you want me, answer "yes" or "no,"
Darling, I will understand.
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone.
Let's pretend that we're together, all alone.
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low,
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go.Got any plans for the weekend
Cause I've got an idea
Lets do something we ain't done in a couple years
Lets roll out on the highway and we'll wave the world goodbye
Well come on baby how bout we just drive
Just drive and get away
Just drive and run away
Cause I love you right beside me
And the way it makes me feel
When I've got one hand on your leg
And one hand on the wheel
And we just drive
Well pack a bag with some simple things
Cause you won't need much
Just a pair of faded jeans
I love it when you wear that stuff
You can let you hair down
We can loose all track of time
Come on baby how bout we just drive
Let's just disappear together
And leave it all behindDon't guess I've ever loved another
Never once before did I ever see the light
Cause they were barely friends and merely lovers
And its taken what you've given me to feel like I do tonight
I am moved by the spirit
And I am here to testify
I found an amen kind of love
The kind that makes you fall down on your knees and reach for the sky above
The kind that your soul just can't ever get enough
I found an amen, an a-hay-men
An amen kind of love
You've given love a brand new meaning
Bound by a higher power than I've ever known before
Safe in your faithful arms I lean
Once I was lost but I'm found forever more
And I am moved by the spirit
I am here to testify
I found an amen kind of love
The kind that makes you fall down on your knees and reach for the sky above
The kind that your soul just can't ever get enough
I found an amen, an a-hay-men
An amen kind of loveSing choir of angels
Sing through the night
I'll be still
I'll be quiet
They took my body
They robbed me blind
There's no turning back now
No use in crying
Every lonely road is behind me
That led me through the changes I don't feel
And I lost sight of flesh and bone
Little I knew, I was going home
Sing choir of angels
Sing me to sleep
Sing soft and sweet
I'm yours to keep
I fought their battles
and I gave my life
For peace and quiet
For pain and strife
Now every lonely road is behind me
That led me through the changes I don't feel
And I lost sight of flesh and bone
Little I knew I was going homeWhen you walk through a storm hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm is a golden sky and the sweet silver song of a lark
Walk on through the wind walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
Walk on walk on with hope in your heart and you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone
Walk on walk onYou always find the way to hurt my pride if I'm not crying you're not satisfied
I don't know why you want to hurt me so
But if you're trying to break my heart you don't have very far to go
You don't have very far to go before the heartaches begin
I already feel the sadness of a heartbreak settin' in
You're turning down the flame of love too low
If you're trying to break my heart you don't have very far to go
[ steel ]
You don't have very far to go before the heartaches begin
I already feel the sadness of a heartbreak settin' in
You can't love me and still want to hurt me so
If you're trying to break my heart you don't have very far to go(Dolly Parton)
The bright lights of the city are a pretty site to see
Perhaps they're extra pretty to a country girl like me
Temptation waits at every turn and it won't let me be
So mama when you pray tonight
Say a special prayer for me
I miss your tender good-night kiss of love and understanding
The good-night kisses I get now are cruel and so demanding
So mama when you pray tonight
And while you're on your knees
Mama say a special prayer for me
The nights get cold and lonely
When you're faraway from home
And lonely makes it easy for a good girl to go wrong
Evil eyes search through the night for lonely girls like me
So mama when you pray tonight
Say a special prayer for me
I miss your tender good-night kiss of love and understanding
These good-night kisses I get now are cruel and so demanding
So mama when you pray tonight
And while you're on your knees
Mama say a special prayer for meWhen you came to me
You said love could not erase
The ever present memory of another face
I tried to make you love me
How I could I be so blind
To think I'd be the one to change your mind
[Chorus]
And if I'm gone before you start
Well you can find me in your heart
Who can say if its right wrong
I've waited for you too long
And if I can't hold on
I'm Gone
When you came to me
I said love will find a way
For every heart that leaves another heart must stay
I guess you couldn't see
As the shadow's in the night
It seems the time for us just wasn't right
[Chorus]It only takes two hours by plane
If you drive you can make it in a day
Just think baby if we met halfway
They say the miles will tear us apart
But they don't how wrong they are
For us forever just isn't that far
I will wait for you
Through the lonely hours
Where you are
Won't change the way I feel
Oh my heart with you
You don't have to worry
This emptiness is something
Only you can fill
I will wait for you
Will you wait for me
Say you will,say you will,say you will,say you will
When you're scared and you think we could fall
When it feels like we just might lose it all
Listen to your heart baby before you build that wall
I will wait for you
Through the lonely hours
Where you are
Won't change the way I feel
Oh my heart with you
You don't have to worry
This emptiness is something
Only you can fill
I will wait for you
Will you wait for me
Say you will,say you will,say you will,say you will
When you've been missing me a little too long
Baby be strong
I will wait for you
Through the lonely hours
Where you are
Won't change the way I feel
Oh my heart with you
You don't have to worry
This emptiness is something
Only you can fill
I will wait for you
Will you wait for me
Say you will,say you will,say you will,say you willI didn't know that losing her
Would be so hard to take
I never thought her memory
Would be so hard to shake
Or that just one little flash of her
Could make my day go wrong
Kinda makes me wanna
Sing a country song
A country song loud and clear
With lots of crying in the beer
A country song loud and clear
With lots of crying in the beer
It's hard to know the story line
Of a book that's halfway read
And it's hard to leave a love undone
And things all left unsaid
But it's not so hard to hate yourself
When you've been up all night long
Kinda makes you wanna
Sing a country song
A country song loud and clear
With lots of crying in the beer
A country song loud and clear
With lots of crying in the beer
A country song loud and clear
With lots of crying in the beer
A country song loud and clear
With lots of crying in the beerDona nobis pacem, pacem
dona nobis pacem
Dona nobis pacem, pacem
dona nobis pacem
Dona nobis pacem, pacem
dona nobis pacem
(repeat)(Dolly Parton)
I remember, I remember
I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember meadows and fields of golden wheat
I remember song birds and sugar cane so sweet
I remember lots of things that often I recall
But I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember ginger bread my momma used to bake
I remember home-made toys that Daddy used to make
Yes, I remember many things that often I recall
But I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember momma and daddy most of all
In our little country home they filled with love
I remember momma and daddy most of all
And all the things they did to make life happier for us
Yes I remember lots of things that often I recall
But I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember candy that daddy used to bring
I remember songs my momma used to sing
Oh I Remember many things that often I recall
But I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember momma and daddy most of all
And how they taught us children right from wrong
I remember momma and daddy most of all
How they used to hope and pray they'd live to see us grown
Oh I remember many things that often I recall
I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember, I remember
I remember momma and daddy most of all
Most of allOh, jealous heart, oh, jealous heart, stop beating
Can't you see the damage you have done?
You have driven him away forever
Jealous heart, now I'm the lonely one
I was part of everything he planned for
And I know he loved me at the start
And now he hates the sight of all I stand for
All because of you, oh, jealous heart
Now that he's gone, he's gone and found another
I know he loved me from the start
Through all the years his memory will haunt me
And all because of you, oh, jealous heart
All because of you, oh, jealous heart
(Oh, jealous heart)Rows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love
I really don't know love at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say "I love you" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they tell me that I've changed
Well somethings lost but somethings gained
In living every day
I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life
I really don't know life at allShe drove South I-95 straight through Carolina
She didn't use no damn map to find her way
She pulled off on a state route just north of Charlotte
And took mostly county roads the rest of the day.
She said I'll give you an intentional heartache
That'll hurt a lot worse than the one he left in me
Would you all step back? so a girl might to get started.
And then he won't have to look twice to see.
She drove up across the yard and though his momma's garden
Didn't touch the brakes, she slammed right into his Chevrolet
Tossed out his clothes, boots, Bud cap, and signed Dale Jr. poster
Then shot the whole mess neon green, a can of DuPont spray
She said I'll give you an intentional heartache
That'll hurt a lot worse than the one he left in me,
Would you all step back? so a girl might to get started,
And he won't have to look twice to see.
She said I'll give you an intentional heartache
That'll hurt a lot worse than the one that you left in me
And tell your little tramp to step back, so your new ex-wife can get started
And you won't have to look twice to see
She said watch this!
Then she sprayed that Bud cap bright green,
Said "Connie put that can of spray paint down!"
Just watch this,
Then she pulled them Nakona boots out, sprayed them neon too
Put the can down Connie!
She give it hell with that can of spray paint
He kept yelling at her
Put the can down
And she sprayed to him ,
Then she did a little dance on top of that Dale Jr. poster,
Just kind of a hoochie coochie
"Alright! Connie,"
He said "I saw ya Connie, now put it down"
Said "watch this," run over to the passenger side of that Monte Carlo
And she sprayed tramp
On the hood, on the back of the house
They tried to call her sister
What was that girl's name?
Said "you gotta come get this girl!"
Nancy, I think. Said watch this,
Said look here,
Look here. Watch this!
She run that girl back up on the porch.
She was screaming Tramp this and Tramp that
Oh yeah she gave him an intentional heartache,
"Alright , alright Connie I heard ya."
His momma was cryin' in on the floor,
His daddy said "told ya that girl was gonna get like that"
She said watch this here.I'd love to be the sugar in your coffee
I'd love to be the finger on your hand
I'd love to be the pillow that you dream on
But most of all I'd love to be your man
I'd love to be the curtain on your window
I'd love to be the picture on your stand
I'd love to be the sunshine in your morning
But most of all I'd love to be your man
I'd love to be the lips that kiss your loving lips
I'd love to be the perfume in your hair
I'd love to be the arms that hold your loving arms
I'd even love to be your rocking chair
I'd love to be the flower in your garden
I'd love to be the object of your plans
I'd love to be the twinkle in your eyes
But most of all I'd love to be your manStraight out of some story
You walk in in all your glory
I thought you were perfect for me.
I was out of my mind.
Looked like I was winning,
It was the best love I'd ever been in.
Just when we were beginning, The End, you left me behind.
And I was looking forward to a happy ending,
So much for pretending.
I should have known better,
Than to think of happy-ever-after,
You and me together,
I was out of my league.
I kept my heart hidden,
Now I'm wishin' that I didn't.
Oh, who am I kidding?
You weren't even intrigued.
And I was looking forward to a happy ending,
So much for pretending.
It could've been beautiful,
If I'd only met ya,
If I'd only let you know
What you meant to me.
And if I could, I would,
Give you a demonstration
Of how my imagination
Thought it ought to be.
So much for pretending.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah
Pretending, pretending, pretending
So much for pretending.I found him by the railroad track this morning I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened just to hear the words the dyin' fellow said
He said they let me out of prison out in Frisco for ten long years I paid for what I done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana to see my Rose and get to know my son

God bless you for finding me this morning now don't forget to give my love to Rose
Give my love to Rose...
Please don't forget to give my love to RoseOh, you rush and you run
To the ends of the earth
Is your work ever done
Oh, and what is it worth
Blood on your hands
Killing a dead man time and again
Time and again
Oh, this curse of your name
Ain't no shower of stones
That'll wash it away
So you wander alone
Blood on your hands
Killing a dead man time and again
Time and again, time and again
Knelt by the low waters and wept
Split every last secret you kept
Oh, my troublesome twin
On the verge of collapse
Will this night put an end
To your sorrow at last
Blood on your hands
Killing a dead man time and again
Time and again, time and again, time and again
Time and again, time and again
Time and again, time and again
Time and again, time and againFeet up, anchor down
Thirty sun block
Getting rubbed around your body
Too hot dive in
Take a little swim
Float around out in the water
Aw what do you say
We stay all day right here
Where the sun sets on tan lines
Footprints on low tide
Boardwalk band plugging in for the night
Party boats are tying up
Cabo drinks are getting drunk
It's all good
It's all right
Just getting high
On a salt life
On a salt life
Cool breeze, palm trees
Start to feel ease of a beer buzz and I like it
A little too much
And all i wanna do is stay right here, right here with you, with you and baby
Soak it up
Don't you love days like this
Where the sun sets on tan lines
Footprints on low tide
Boardwalk band plugging in for the night
Party boats are tying up
Cabo drinks are getting drunk
It's all good
It's all right
Just getting high
On a salt life
On a salt life
Beach bums
Party flip flop
No tick tock on a snowbirds watch
Never stops, It never stops, it never stops
Where the sun sets on tan lines
Footprints on low tide
Boardwalk band plugging in for the night
Party boats are tying up
Cabo drinks are getting drunk
It's all good
It's all right
Just getting high
On a salt life
On a salt life
Feel so good to live a salt lifeLets ride, down highway 49. Lets ride, down to the waterline.
Chorus: I can feel me coming alive, when you take me out for a ride. So lets ride.
Lets ride out of town into the night. Lets ride, aw baby everythings gonna be alright.
Chorus: I can feel you deep down inside. When you take me out for a ride.MY SPECIAL ANGEL
Writer Jimmy Duncan
You are my special angel Sent from up above The Lord smiled down on me And sent an angel to love You are my special angel Right from paradise I know you're an angel Heaven is in your eyes The smile from your lips brings the summer sunshine Tears from your eyes bring the rain I feel your touch, your warm embrace And I'm in heaven again You are my special angel Through eternity I'll have my special angel Here to watch over me A smile from your lips brings the summer sunshine The tears from your eyes bring the rain I feel your touch, your warm embrace And I'm in heaven again You are my special angel Through eternity I'll have my special angel Here to watch over me Here to watch over meOn a two lane north of Casper is where this all begins
Heading back to Oklahoma for a week to visit friends
She was walking 'long the highway so I pulled off to the side
And asked her if she needed a ride
We tore up that ole blacktop 'til we found I-25
And just into Colorado she asked if she could drive
I'd never met nobody like her. I'd never laughed so much
And I grew hungry for her touch
(Chorus)
I used to think of autumn
As sweaters and leaves
And I used to think the night
Was just for dreamers and theives
But that was before she came
Allison Miranda was her name
By the time that we hit Kansas we both felt pretty beat
So we found ourselves a motel and grabbed a bite to eat
We'd rest a few short hours; soon we'd be out of there
Three days later we came up for air
(Repeat Chorus)
Now I can't forget the morning when I woke alone in bed
To a rose left on her pillow and a good-bye note that read
You cannot grow a flower if you do not have the seed
Now I've got everything I need
(Repeat Chorus)It's true you have me twisted around your finger it seems that's where I belong
You know how to hold me to thrill me and control me
Just enough to keep me a hangin' on on just enough to keep me hangin' on
My heart is like a yo-yo on the string I'm tied to you right or wrong
My love keeps a growing cause your love keeps a showing
Just enough to keep me a hangin' on on just enough to keep me hangin' on
A love as strong as mine will let me do most anything
Like hiding tears of heartaches and dreaming silly dreams
You've got me where you want me you keep stringing me along
Just enough to keep me a hangin' on on just enough to keep me hangin' onI don't want to hurt nobody
Don't want to make nobody cry
I don't want to do wrong, I don't want to do wrong
I don't want to tell no lies
I'm lovin' you, lovin' you against my will
Lovin' you, lovin' you against my will
I don't want to hear the phone ring
Don't want to hear your voice on the line
I don't want to come to you, I don't want to come to you
I don't want to give in this time
Girl, I'm lovin' you, lovin' you against my will
Your love is like a deep dark river
Pullin' me out to sea
The harder I try to resist you
The weaker I seem to be
I don't want to turn down your side street
I don't want to pull in your drive
Don't want to see you standin' there, don't want to see you standin' there
Don't want to see that look in your eyes
Girl, I'm lovin' you, lovin' you against my will
Your love is like a deep dark river
Pullin' me out to sea
The harder I try to resist you
The weaker I seem to be
I don't want to feel your heartbeat
I don't want to taste your kiss
I don't want to call your name, I don't want to call your name
I don't want to want you like this
Girl, I'm lovin' you, lovin' you against my will
Lovin' you, lovin' you against my willJEFF CANADY
(Danny Dill)
'63 Cedarwood Publishing
Hurry hurry children you better get a runnin'
Jeff Canady's comin' and he eats little youngin's
His wife is a witch and Jeff can switch
From a snake To a frog or an old mad dog
So you better leave him alone
My sister was a backward child she never walked a step
She crawled around the old home place and always needed help
At eight years old she never walked and never went to school
The teacher said she couldn't help she'd grow to be a fool
We took her to a fine surgeon he said dear folks I dread
The body's strong but her mind won't go it's something in her head
Now there was a bum who walked around way back in those days
And momma would say we'd better be good or he'd take us kids away
Hurry hurry children you better get a runnin'...
We sheltered Sis from snakes and frogs and when the mad dogs came
But the one thing that she feared the most was old Jeff Canady's name
One day old Jeff came down the road when sister played alone
She screamed and squirmed and then decided she was there alone
She jumped and ran to momma's arms as Jeff went on his way
But thank the Lord my sister walks until this very day
Guess old Jeff is walking yet down heavens lonesome mile
But beneath his beard I swear I bet he wears a great big smile
Hurry hurry children you better get a runnin'...I heard no Christmas carols as I walked down the street
I heard no Merry Christmas from people I'd meet
It seemed you've made the whole world blue
Christmas ain't Christmas dear without you
I talked to a snowman and to my surprise when I spoke of you he started to cry
Now that's pretty sad to see a snowman turn blue
Christmas ain't Christmas dear without you
[ steel ]
No Christmas ain't Christmas since you went away
And now it seems like just any other day
Yes you turned my whole world blue Christmas ain't Christmas dear without youTearin' down a dirt road, rebel flag flyin', coon dog in the back
Truck bed loaded down with beer and a cold one in my lap
Earnhart sticker behind my head and my woman by my side
Tail-pipe's poppin', the radio's rockin', "Country boy can survive"
If you got a problem with that, ha, ha, you can kiss my country ass
Well, I love turkey calls, overalls, Wrangler jeans
Smoke nothin' but Marlboro reds
Tattoos up and down my arms
And deer heads over my bed
My Granddaddy fought in World War Two
But my Daddy went to Vietnam
And I ain't scared to grab my gun
And fight for my homeland
If you don't love the American flag
You can kiss my country ass
If you're a down home, backwoods redneck
Hey come on, stand up and raise your glass
But if you ain't down with my outlaw crowd
You can kiss my country ass, aw yeah
Aw, yeah
Well, there's a whole lotta high-class people out there
That's lookin' down on me
Cause the country club where I belong
Is a honky tonk till three in the mornin'
Don't wear no fancy clothes, no ties or three piece suits
You can find me in my camouflage cap
My T-shirt and cowboy boots
If that don't fit your social class
You can kiss my country ass
If you're a down home, backwoods redneck
Hey come on, stand up and raise your glass
But if you ain't down with my outlaw crowd
You can kiss my country ass
Well, I'm a front-porch sittin', guitar pickin', moonshine
'Backer chew spittin' country boy from the woods
And I love fried chicken and blue gill fishin'
And outlaw women and I wouldn't change if I could, no
I ain't tryin' to start no fight but I'll finish one every time
So you just mind your own damn business
Stay the hell outta mine, if you got a problem with that
You can kiss my country ass
I said, if you got a problem with any of that
You can kiss my natural born, redneck to the bone
Ever lovin' country ass, that's rightIve been sitting down here so long I composed a song
I wanna meet you Country gal
Every time she dance I wish I had the chance
Theres a river flowing in every man
All the trees do sway when she dance that way
I wanna meet you country gal
I swear she must have been born from that blossoms breeze
She got diamonds all around her ankle bone
She got her gals gathered round and the boys cant make no time
Shes like a ruby rolling round in a bucket of dimes
She got skin like chocolate milk-make a married man feel no guilt
The way she moves when she moves and she groove
Somebody slap my face and throw me under the jail
Cause I cant stop thinking about that country galOh sometimes I go walkin' through fields where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old mem'ries like that or do I ever cross your mind
[ fiddle - mandolin ]
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Cause you miss me do you darling
Oh and do your mem'ries ever take you back into another place in time
And do you ever miss the feelings and the love we shared
When you were with me tell me darling or do I ever cross your mind
[ guitar ]
Oh how often I wish that again I could kiss your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two lovin' arms that once held me so gentle and close
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever recall these old mem'ries at all or do I ever cross your mind
Tell me darling do I ever cross your mindBefore you left I set myself some crying time aside
I knew that getting over you would take my heart some time
But love won't fade or slip away to please my foolish pride
Because my heart overrules my mind
Living without you is too much to live with too many memories too many tears
Living without you is too much to live with too much to carry too much to bear
Living without you
Living without you is too much to bearYou know I'm working overtime
Just trying to cover my behind
You know you took all my money
And I guess you thought you took my mind
You can run, you can't hide
And just as sure as your breathing
I ain't gonna let it slide
When you're living in a glass house
Don't go to bed with the lights on
Well I was raised by the rule
That forgiving is the way divine
Took everything I had for giving
Then you left what was left behind
Go on and run, you can't hide
And sure as you're breathing
I ain't gonna let it slide
I got acquainted with your cleaners
And they really did all right by you
I've got my own window cleaners comin'
Now let's see just what you do
Day or night, It's alright, What you do
When you wake up by the dawn's early light
Come onOh Gosh, here we go again.
A fella can't get no rest around this joint.
Well, she got up this morning at six a.m.,
She was as grumpy as can be.
Not a chance of sleepin' late,
'Cos she started vacuuming.
Said: "Get your lazy butt up Cledus,
"You gotta take me to the Mall.
"Don't forget to bring them credit cards,
"'Cos I'm a'gonna use 'em all."
Wives do it all the time,
We can't meet all their demands.
A bunch a female General Schwarzkopfs,
A' barkin' off their commands.
They spend all our money, it's a mystery,
How us menfolk can survive.
(Oh why do we? Can't tell if they break a nail).
Wives do it, all the time.
Oh, her make up's scattered all over the place,
And the bathroom's a cloud of dust.
Didn't leave no gas in my pick up,
And she hates the way I get my hair cut.
You know you sure are a cold one, baby,
You get green with jealousy,
When I steal your Victoria Sacred,
Or watch Mindy on CMT.
Wives do it all the time,
We can't meet all their demands.
You know they lose all their sweetness,
When we give 'em that wedding band.
They spend all our money, it's a mystery,
How us menfolk can survive.
(Well, they never fail, to find a sale.)
Wives do it, all the time.
Well, she might just get frisky tonight,
So I won't get no-where near her.
And if she says: "Coyte, come on to bed,"
I'll pretend that I don't hear her.
OOOOOh.
They spend all our money, it's a mystery,
How us menfolk can survive.
(Beats all I ever saw, they'll bite rough to sore.)
Wives do it, all the time.
Yeah, wives do it.
All the time, all the time.
Wives do it.
All the time, all the time.
Wives do it.
All the time, all the time.
Yeah, wives do it.
Mine does it all the time.Y'all come y'all come oh y'all come to see us when you can
Y'all come y'all come (oh y'all come on over to see us now and then)
The kinfolks're comin' comin' by the dozen eatin' everything from soup to hay
And right after dinner they ain't looking any thinner
And here's what you'll hear them say
Y'all come y'all come...
(When you live in the country everybody is your neighbor on this one thing you can rely
They'll all come to see you and never never leave you
Saying y'all come to see us by and by)
Y'all come y'all come...
[ harmonica - steel ]
Y'all come y'all come...
Yeah y'all come on over to see us now and thenMe and Jimmie Rodgers used to ride them rollin' boxcars in the summer time
Jimmie he'd play his guitar I'd lay back and watch the stars and sip my wine
Me and Audie Murphy used to crawl out on our bellies through the German lines
Audie I won't leave you here I'll pull you through cause buddy you're a pal of mine
Me and Phil Rizzuto didn't we move round like lightnin' on the double play
I'd look over in the stands and Marilyn should see me and she'd smile and wave
Hell no Coach Lombardi this old broken back ain't nothin' if the game was saved
And fellers if I don't pull through just put a little golden football on my grave
John Wayne he once said to me them Japs will take the Island
And we've got to save the old Red White and Blue
Someone's got to swim out to the submarine and warn 'em
And Bare you know I hate like hell to ask you to
Me and Tony Zarro we used to spar together up in Stillman's Gym
Knowin' someday it would be the Garden and the championship for me or him
And Coop if no one in this town is man enough to back you when Frank Miller comes
Then come High Noon I'll walk with you I may be young but I know how to use a gun
Judy Grable don't you cry you know you can be a star
And with my drinkin' I'd just hold you back
Go on and sign the contracts hon and I'll read about you
In some old newspaper blowin' cross some lonesome hobo camp
Me and Jimmie Rodgers we still ride them rollin' boxcars in the summer time
Jimmie he plays his guitar I lay back and watch the stars and sip my wine
Me and Audie Murphy we still crawl out on our bellies through the German lines
At away there's scooter shoot that ball to me and I swear we'll get two this timeSecond hand shoes second hand clothes they all call her second hand rose
They all think they're pretty smart but rose don't have a second hand heart
I love a little girl who lives across the way I go to see her nearly every day
But when I get the money I'll take her far away
So they can't gather around her and say
Second hand shoes
They tease her about her clothes and things
It's hard to believe some folks can be so mean
But when I get the money I'll buy her the best
I'll take rose you can have all the rest
Second hand shoes
Second hand shoesI'm so used to loving you sweetheart you're on my mind each minute we're apart
And I love you more each day we go through
Yes you're my life and I'll live it loving you
I'm so used to loving you it seems
I can't stand the thought of losing you not even in my dreams
Hold me close and tell me what I'd do without you
I couldn't take it I'm so used to loving you
I'm so used to the little things you say like hello darlin' did you have a busy day
And the way you hold me close when day is through
Yes you're my love and I'll love it loving you
I'm so used to loving you it seems
I'm just too used to loving youI've met the Master on my knees been tested and been tried
I've seen the God of heaven paint the fields and country side
I've been the husband of a wife heard my newborn baby cry
But when I've learned enough to really live I'll be old enough to die old enough to die
I'm just a plain hard working man no stopping place have I found
Although I'm tired I'm still inspired at night when I lie down
I've learned to like it on God's earth sometimes I wonder why
When I've learned enough to really live I'll be old enough to die old enough to die
When I've learned enough to really live I'll be old enough to die old enough to dieIt's strange to hear your voice
I did not expect for you to call
You wonder how I'm doin'
How I'm holdin' up
Since you did me wrong
Well how am I doin' since you did what you done to me?
I can't lie I sometimes cry when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy and I don't get much sleep
Baby, that's how I'm doin' since you did what you done to me
Well now wait one minute, I
Failed to mention
Those tears I cried, are tears of joy
Because it was no fun there
Under your thumb and
Now that we're done I'm
Gettin' right every night
With every single ever-lovin' girl in sight, so
How am I doin' since you did what you done to me?
I can't lie I sometimes cry when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy and I don't get much sleep
Baby, that's how I'm doin' since you did what you done to me
Well when all my friends heard what a
You know what you were they
Took me out on the town
But then I heard our song and
I dance along but
It felt all wrong cause
She was sweet, she let me lead
She never took her ever-lovin' eyes off me so
How am I doin' since you did what you done to me?
I can't lie I sometimes cry when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy and I don't get much sleep
Baby, that's how I'm doin' since you did what you done to me
Well I don't know what you were thinkin'
Runnin' round on me
Now you say you're sorry
Well honey I agree...so
How are you doin' since you did
What you done to me
Girl don't lie you know you cry
'Cause you know how good it used to be
Yeah, tell me does the thought of
Losin' my true love make it hard to sleep, baby
How are you doin' since you did
What you done to me
Yeah how are you doin', now that you know
How I'm doin' since you did
What you done to meIt's an instrumental.All the days that ended well in to tomorrow
All the times I couldn't lay it on the line
This old conscience that I could never follow
I hate to say it but I wish it wasn't mine
All the broken hearts that didn't see it coming
All the tears that should've never hit the floor
All the looking back and mainly all the running
All these reasons that I'm standing at your door
I think I've had enough
This time I've given in
Without you it's too rough
So I'm standing here again
I've finally realized
This love it never dies
I'm really not that tough
No I'm really not that tough
I think I've had enough
Life is gonna be a circus
Rain or shine
Heights did always make me nervous
So if you're gonna ride the Ferris Wheel
I'll need your hand in mine
I think I've had enough
This time I've given in
Without you it's too rough
So I'm crawling back again
I've finally realized
This love that never dies
I'm really not that tough
No I'm really not that tough
I think I've had enough
I'm really not that tough
I think I've had enough
I think I've had enoughYou started a flame I can't drown then told me you see me around
All I have to do is get a glimpse of you and then
That's just enough to start me dreamin' again
You promised a love I could hold then you turned away so distant and cold
All I have to do is hear about you from a friend
And that's just enough to start me dreamin' again
And as long as I dream you'll be on my mind
And lately I've been dreaming all the time
All I do is think about you and the dream that didn't end
And that's just enough to start me dreamin' again
And that's just enough to start me dreamin' againBaby please don't get too close to me
Cause that ring you're wearin'
Says that you're not free
But if I said I didn't want ya
Well you know I'd be a liar
You better run while there's still time
Cause I can't stop this fire
I want you bad I can't help myself
But you belong to someone else
I'd leave you alone, darling, if I could
But I want you bad and that ain't good
Baby please put away those ruby lips
And those big blue eyes
Are too hard to resist
I'm not that kind of man
Oh and usually I'm strong
But it's gettin' hard to tell between
What's right and what is wrong
I want you bad I can't help myself,
I want you bad girl that ain't good
I want you bad bad bad that ain't goodHe wanted someone who loves the land as much as he does
Someone who knows the blessin' of a good hard rain
Somebody simple and strong that he knows he can count on
Soft as the wind, you're bold enough to bless his name
That's why God loves cowboys
I believe there's a place in his heart
'Cause when the herd needs tendin'
The fences needs mendin'
He knows they'll work hard
On his great big ranch called life
'Cause they love and take care of all it's creations
From the horses they ride
To those broken hardened honky tonk angels
Ooh that's why God loves cowboys
He knew they'd need room to breathe and freedom
So he gave em' Texas and those big Montana skies
He was there when he heard those prayers
Coming from shying
Right beside that young man on his last ride
That's why God loves cowboys
I believe there's a place in his heart
'Cause when the herd needs tendin'
The fences needs mendin'
He knows they'll work hard
On his great big ranch called life
'Cause they love and take care of all it's creations
From the horses they ride
To those broken hardened honky tonk angels
Ooh that's why God loves cowboys
Ooh those cold nights get lonely
He needs more than just a good fire keeping him warm
Ooh there's nothing more holy
Than a love of a woman weather life storm
That's why God loves cowgirls
I believe there's a place in his heart
'Cause when the herd needs tendin'
And the fences needs mendin'
He knows they'll work hard
On his great big ranch called life
'Cause they love and take care of all it's creations
From the horses they ride
To those broken hardened honky tonk heroes
Ooh, that's why God loves cowgirls
Ooh, that's why God loves cowboysYou were just some one
Some friend of mine said take her out
An' have yourselves a good time
To be honest I was far from over a broken heart
You were the furthest thing from my mind
And it didn't seem to matter to you
When I looked away when we were introduced
[Chorus]
Cause you broke the ice with a killer smile
Ordered us a drink and we talked a while
And I slowly started comin' around
Now here I am
To tell the truth I did my best to tell myself
Hey don't forget the last time
And I stood there in disbelief
That how easily you got to me with your eyes
You reached across the table and you took my hand
I knew I was in trouble right there and then
[Chorus]
Down on one knee
Am I getting to you baby?
The way you got to me
[Chorus]I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.
City folks got worries,
A country boy's got none
All I wanna be is the daddy of a farmer's son
Subdivisions are silly, I wanna be a hillbilly.
I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.
When I get finished plowin'
I'm gonna go to the pond
And take my sweet baby
And have some good clean fun
You gotta work, that's a pity
I'm gonna be a hillbilly.
I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.
When I die, throw me a big fine wake
And have a party in the barn
Let me lie in state
Plant me under that oak tree
I wanna be a hillbilly
I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.
Subdivisions are silly
I wanna be a hillbilly.Mouths to feed, shoes to buy
Rent to pay, tears to dry
Brand new world, I can't relate
Let us choose to not participate
Now open up, let me wander in
Your heart is not such a tender thing
Brand new world, I contend
Only love will stop the withering
Oh, to lie in wait
As the shadows and the shapes
Spill across the walls
Like a river deep in spate
4 a.m., dark reality
Brand new world and my heart is missingMidnight in Montgomery,
Silver Eagle, Lonely Road,
I was on my way to Mobile,
For a big new year's eve show,
Stopped for just a minute,
To see a friend outside of town,
With my collar up, I found his name,
And felt the wind die down,
And a drunk man in a cowboy hat,
Took me by surprise,
Wearin' shiny boots, a nudie suit, and haunted, haunted eyes,
He said friend it's good to see you,
It's nice to know ya care,
Then the wind picked up and he was gone,
Was he ever really there?
[Chorus]
'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery,
Just hear that wipperwill,
See the stars light up the purple sky,
Feel that lonesome chill,
'Cause when the wind is right,
You'll hear his song,
Smell whisky in the air,
Midnight in montgomery,
He's always singin' there,
Well I climbed back on that eagle,
Took one last look around,
Red tail lights, shadow moves slow across the ground,
And off somewhere a midnight train, is slowly passin' by,
I can hear that wistle moanin',
I'm so lonesome I could cry,
[Chorus]
He's always singin there
Well Hank's always singin' there.A star fell from heaven right into my arms the brightest star I know I've never seen
Then I found out that it was only you with all your charms
Who came into my life to fill a dream
A fallen star that's what you are the twinkle in your eye came from the sky
You must have strayed from the Milky Way a fallen star that's what you are
The heavens must be lonely now that you are mine
I'm sure they'll miss a star as bright as you
The stars will send their blessings and brighter they will shine
When they see the dream that's coming true
A fallen star that's what you areI'm so tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
I'm so tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
I was a lonely soul
I had nobody till I met you
But you keep a me waiting
All of the time what can I do?
It's your life you can do what you want
Do what you like
But please don't keep a me waiting
Please don't keep a me waiting
I'm so tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
I'm so tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for youWritten by billy burnette.

Rollin' down the runway
Thinkin' 'bout the one-way of my life
With another cup of coffee
And another lonesome city far behind
This old 747 will be flyin' over Heaven
One more time
And the tears begin to fallin'
When I think about the mountains on my mind
But now the skies above are sunny
And it's time to say it's funny
How I never thought I'd ever fly this high
But maybe someday when it's over
When I'm just a little older
I can go back to the mountains on my mind
Flyin' through the night time
To a far off city skyline in the dawn
And a thousand lights below me
Are like fireflies tryin' to tell me that I'm wrong
So I try to find a reason
To forget the changin' seasons in my mind
But the winds of time are blowin'
And I've gotta go on knowin' that I tried
'Cause now I hear a different drummer
And I've used up all my summers
Chasin' rainbows that I really didn't wanna find
But maybe someday when it's over
When I'm just a little older
I can go back to the mountains on my mind( Love is real EP )
Everybody wants someone to
Compare to the last one in the picture
But they never even think of what they're missing
And the last one never seems to leave the picture
Everybody wants something more
Out there in the big world of high business
But they don't go off and throw away their labors
And abandon everything they've worked so hard for
All the evidence in the world
Won't say anything about your conscience
And i don't believe you think of me that highly
And i don't consider this your final offerIf heartaches brought fame in love's crazy game
I'd be a legend legend in my time
If they gave gold statues for tears and regrets
I'd be a legend in my time
But oh, they don't give awards
And there's no praise or fame
For a heart that's been broken
Over love that's in vain
If loneliness meant world acclaim
Then everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time
But oh, they don't give awards
And there's no praise or fame
For a heart that's been broken
Over love that's in vain
If loneliness meant world acclaim
Then everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time
I'd be a legend in my timeOh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Oh it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow
Let it snow
Let it snow
Baby, let it snow
Let it keep on falling downAlmost you fell in love with me
Almost you were my bride to be
But each promise that was made
You have broken and betrayed
Oh, how close we were almost
Almost I heard the church bells ring
Almost I heard the choir sing
But I hear now instead
All those unkind words you said
Oh, how close we were almostHow dare you accuse me of being on a leash
Just because you haven't seen me
On the town the last few weeks
You say that girl I'm seein' has somehow made me change
But I say take a closer look
Deep down I'm still the same
Yeah, I still love the night life
Even though I've settled down
I can have the time of my life
Without leavin' the house
We have our own private parties
The good times never end
Yeah, I still love the night life
It's the best it's ever been
There may not be a jukebox, but I still love to dance
We two step cross that kitchen floor
Each time we get the chance
From neon light to soft white, sawdust to squeaky clean
It's different circumstances
Ah, but some things never change
Yeah, I still love the night life
Even though I've settled down
I can have the time of my life
Without leavin' the house
We have our private parties
The good times never end
Yeah, I still love the night life
It's the best it's ever been
Yeah, I still love the night life
Even though I've settled down
I can have the time of my life
Without leavin' the house
We have our own private parties
The good times never end
Yeah, I still love the night life
It's the best it's ever been
Yeah, I still love the night life
It's the best it's ever been(Remember me I'm the one who loves you)
When you're all alone and blue no one to tell your troubles to
Remember me I'm the one who loves you
When the whole world turned you down not a true friend can be found
Remember me I'm the one who loves you
And through all kinds of weather my love will never change
Through the sunshine and the shadows I'll always be the same
We're together right or wrong where you go I'll tag along
Remember me I'm the one who loves you
[ steel ]
And through all kinds of weather...I guess it's just not my day
The wind blew my morning paper away
If it ain't one thing it's you
If you've heard that I'm goin crazy
It's true
The wheels seem to fall off whatever I do
If it ain't one thing
It's you
I rented that movie you hate
But that old VCR just chewed up the tape
Then I went to the freezer thought I'd cook me a steak
All I found was that old piece of our wedding cake
If it ain't one thing it's you
If you've heard that I'm goin crazy
It's true
The wheels seem to fall off whatever I do
If it ain't one thing
It's you
But I never knew that I needed you so
But now that I've lost you, I can't let you go
If it ain't one thing it's you
If you've heard that I'm goin crazy
It's true
The wheels seem to fall off whatever I do
If it ain't one thing
It's you
Oh if it ain't one thing
It's youCall her your sweetheart whenever she feels blue
You know there's not a thing she wouldn't do for you
And when you are tempted to wander astray
Remember there are times she feels the very same way
Share all your sunshine and all your heartaches too
Let her know that she means more than all the world to you
You'll find the future holds a treasure worth much more than gold
If you'll only call her your sweetheart
Share all your sunshine and all your heartaches too
Let her know that she means more than all the world to you
You'll find the future holds a treasure worth much more than gold
If you'll only call her your sweetheart(Dolly Parton)
Somewhere a river of happiness flows
We'll sit on its banks while the warm breezes blow
Somewhere there's a garden where only love grows
Somewhere a river of happiness flows
Dry your eyes, don't cry no more
We'll find a place where there's laughter and joy
So take my hand and don't let go
Come with me and together we'll go
Somewhere a river of happiness flows
We'll sit on its banks while the warm breezes blow
Somewhere there's a garden where only love grows
Somewhere a river of happiness flows
We'll walk in the sunshine
We'll laugh and we'll sing
And dance to the tune that our happiness brings
Come go with me to this place I speak of
Together, we'll find it, this place is called love
Somewhere a river of happiness flows
We'll sit on its banks while the warm breezes blow
Somewhere there's a garden where only love grows
Somewhere a river of happiness flows
Somewhere a river of happiness flowsLast Saturday morning I shut off the alarm
Drove out in the valley to old Dan Cook's farm
A sign on the fence post put up with one nail read 10 a.m. sharp for big public sale
At least forty people were out in the yard
Looking for bargains they were dealing real hard
To buy up the pieces and find out the worth of fifty years living so close to the earth
Who'll give me five I got five now who'll give me ten
I'll call out the numbers and you just say when
For a lifetime of mem'ries some happy some sad
Two for a dollar the price sure ain't bad
No bids for the carriage rottin' out by the shed
The one that they drove on the night they were wed
Five bucks for the brass bed a little bit worn
Not much for the place where the five kids were born
And the old parlor piano still sounded alright
Just as good as it did many Saturday nights
And the big round oak table where dinner was made
Brought almost as much as the tiffany shade
Who'll give me five...
Two for a dollar the price sure ain't badNo sir I ain't been drinking
I ain't even had one beer
This sweet thing's got me buzzing
From whispering in my ear
Just take a peek up in here
At this little hot mess
Mister, you'll understand
I'm doing my best
And I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
All over the road
Don't wanna get no ticket
Don't wanna cause no wreck
It's hard to concentrate with her pretty little lips on my neck
I say "girl take it easy"
She laughs, says "it'll be fine"
How am I supposed to keep it between the lines
Yeah I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
And all over the road
Something 'bout these wheels rolling
Radio playing gets her going
I'm trying to get her home as fast as I can go
And I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
Have a little mercy on me
Sir I'm sorry I know
I'm all over the road
All over the road
All over the roadShe goes walking through my mind
I've tried to drive away her memory but each night it comes back to torture me
Cause once again there she is right on time
When she goes walking through my mind
She goes walking through my mind tearing out a little each time
Her footsteps are getting louder all the time when she goes walking through my mind
I've tried to drown my thoughts in the wine
But a glass full of heartaches all I found
Cause once again there she is right on time and she goes walking through my mind
She goes walking through my mindI gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting to me
Gotta find a way to get to your heart to sweep you off your feet
I'll wrap you up in my love, cover you with kisses so sweet
I gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting to me
I'll win you over, over and over again
I'm getting closer, closer than I've ever been
I gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting to me
Gotta find a way to get to your heart to sweep you off your feet
I'll wrap you up in my love, cover you with kisses so sweet
I gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting to me
I'll keep on trying, trying and I'll never give up
I would be lying if I said we were close enoughI'm standing on a bridge
I'm waiting in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothing but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening but there's no sound
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you
I'm with youI'm with you
I'm looking for a place
I'm searching for a face
Is anybody here I know?
'Cause nothing's going right
And everything's a mess
And no one likes to be alone
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you
I'm with you
Oh why is everything so confusing
Maybe I'm just out of my mind
Yeah-he-yaa, yeah-he-yah
Yeah-he-yah, yeah-he-yah, yeah
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you
I'm with you
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you
I'm with you
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you
I'm with you
I'm with youRemember Ricky told Diane when he slipped
That gold ring on her hand it was there to stay
Now the attorneys are on the phone
Dividing up everything they own
They're going separate ways
So many hearts get wasted
In those Ricky and Diane cases
And I hate to see good love die young
Oh, we're two of the lucky ones
Love will save a few then bury some
The heart grows fond or the heart goes numb
I knew from the first star we wished upon
We're two of the lucky ones
Now just like Ricky and Diane
Love could have slipped right through our hands
But we kept holding on
Call it good fortune or you call it fate
But the luck we've had we've had to make
By working hard at home
So many hearts get wasted
When they stop bending they start breaking
The longer we love the more we learn
Oh, we're two of the lucky ones
Love will save a few then bury some
The heart grows fond or the heart goes numb
I knew from the first star we wished upon
We're two of the lucky ones
Girl, we're two of the lucky onesToday I started loving you again I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again
What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I've cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come
And that crying time for me had just begun
Cause today I started loving you again
Today I started loving you againIn my Grandma's house her children would sing
Guitars a twangin' and their laughter would ring
I was little but I was the biggest kid
I wanted to do what the grown-ups did
In a big shiny car we'd head down the road
To sing for the miners who brought out the coal
Many a time I slept on the floorboard cold
On a quilt with my little sister
The Wildwood Rose
[Chorus:]
And if I could change a thing in this world
I'd go back to the days
When Grandma and her girls
Were singing sweet and low
For me and the Wildwood Rose
We'd be way down the road by the break of dawn
Biscuits and gravy and a truck stop song
In a world all my own I saw what I saw
And in the rear view mirror I'd get a wink from my Grandma
[Chorus]
A lee a o a lee a o o lay dee who
A lee o lay dee
Oh I'll always remember the day that she died
My daddy he called me and he started to cry
I rode on an airplane with all of my pain
My tears would not stop
We stood in a circle and sang
[Chorus]
For me and the Wildwood Rose
For me and the Wildwood Rose
For me and the Wildwood Rose
A lee a o
A lee a o lay dee whoI gave up cigarettes, haven't had to light one yet.
It's been a year sense I stopped.
Same goes for alcohol.
I don't touch the stuff at all.
I used to drink till I dropped.
[CHORUS:]
But those were tough this is easy, and it feels
So good to say. Forgetting you is not that hard to do
For I've done it a thousand times a day. Oh I've done it a
Thousand times a day.
Friends said it would take some time to get you off my mind.
Some said I'd never let you go. But, I guess I've proved
Them wrong. One more bad habit gone.
Just like the whiskey and the smokes.
But those were tough this is easy, and I'm
All right I'm ok.
Forgetting
(CHORUS:)
I've given you up for good, just like I said I would.
Oh the night you walked away.
But that was tough this is easy,
( CHORUS:)YOU LIED TO ME
Writer Bill Anderson
RECORDED BY TRACY BYRD
You looked at me as only you can look at me You touched my cheek and told me not to cry But you said you'd found somebody you loved more than me And you told me I'd forget you by and by But you lied to me, yes you lied to me You said time would close the wound that bled inside of me But every breath I take brings back your memory You said I'd forget you, but you lied to me Monday, I said Tuesday you'd be off my mind Then I gave myself 'til Wednesday then on down the line Funny how September turns to June so fast And you told me this pain was not the kind to last But you lied to me, yes you lied to me You said time would close the wound that bled inside of me But every breath I take brings back your memory You said I'd forget you, but you lied to me Oh you said I'd forget you, but you lied to meDidn't ask you to love me
So why did you love me
You said that you loved me
'Cause I didn't need it if you didn't mean it
You didn't either
I took a chance fell in love
Well that's my fault
Well it takes two to win or lose
Come on just tell me what to do
Give me something to go on
Or just go on and let me
Go on without you
Just give me something to go on
Didn't ask you to need me
If you needed me
Well you needed me
I'm only asking for honesty
Honestly
If you're afraid to fall in love
I'm not your enemy
You're confused just to tell the truth
Come on baby just talk to meHold me down, lift me up,
There's someone on the bedside waiting there for me.
I hear my name, I turn around,
There's gotta be a downside, something I don't see
Around me.
Hide me.
Dying in the light of the room
Blind side, please.
I don't really want to be seen in my own eyes
Something's wrong, awake all night.
'cause I can feelthe dark side closing in on me.
Do you see me as I see myself?
I promise there's a downside, something you can't see
About me.
Hide me.
Dying in the light of the room
Blind side, please.
I don't really want to be seen in my own eyes.
Lost in translation, free to fall,
One situation, and lose it all.
Hide me.
Dying in the light of the room
Blind side, please.
I don't really want to be seen in my own eyes.In Santa's bag there's lots of toys for little girls and little boys

(There's a knife for Bill...
On Christmas day in the morning on Christmas day in the morningWhen you give yourself away
Love becomes somethin' that you do
Not just somethin' that you say
Ain't it funny how a smile
Makes the world a better place
When you give yourself away
When you open up your heart
You never know how it's gonna end
And that's the scary part
Walls are gonna tumble on down
Dam's gonna break
When you give yourself away
And reaching out for someone
Well, is all that we can do
You reach out for me babe
I'll reach out for you
When you look up to the sky
Feel like ya just don't belong
And wishin' you could fly
You find out you're not alone
And really all the same
When you give yourself away
When you give yourself awaySaturday night, and a six pack girl
A big star shinin' on a small town world
It's a helluva life, it's a helluva life
And KC lights on a dirt road dance
You take that kiss just as far as you can
It's a helluva life, it's a helluva life
And pennies make dimes and dimes make dollars,
Dollars buy gas and long neck bottles,
Beer gets a barefoot country girl swayin',
To a song that's playin' on the radio station.
The bad times make the good times better,
You look in her eyes and you're gone forever,
On a heavenly ride, yeah it's a helluva life.
It's a helluva life
And we all have faith, and we all have hope,
But we're all a little lost in the same damn boat.
It's a helluva life, yeah it's a helluva life.
There's something bout the night girl,
When you got the right girl,
Sittin' right beside you,
Lookin' at the sky, girl
Thinkin' bout why we're here, and where we're goin'
Baby, here we are, and all I know is
And pennies make dimes and dimes make dollars,
Dollars buy gas and long neck bottles,
Beer gets a barefoot country girl swayin,
To a song that's playin', the world stops fadin'
The bad times make the good times better,
You look in her eyes and you're gone forever,
On a heavenly ride, yeah it's a helluva life.
It's a helluva life
Something bout the night girl,
When you got the right girl,
Sittin' right beside you,
Lookin' at the sky, girl

Baby, here we are, and all I know is
Pennies make dimes and dimes make dollars,
Dollars buy gas and long neck bottles,
Beer gets a barefoot country girl swayin',
To a song that's playin', it's a perfect combination
The bad times make the good times better,
You look in her eyes and you're gone forever,
On a heavenly ride, yeah it's a helluva life.

Aw one helluva ride

It's a helluva life
Yeah it's a helluva life
It's a helluva lifeLittle one when you grow old
Keep alive these precious years
Remember all our fields of gold
And the silver of my tears
Little one when shadows falls
And the time for my departure nears
Say a prayer and gather all
The silver of my tears
Tears of joy and thankfulness
From the wealth of love inside
Shining in the eyes you bless
Are tears to sweet to hide
While you live
Apart of me
Will be with you
Through out the years
Shining in your eyes
Will be
The silver of my tearsTrain arrive 16 coaches long
Train arrive 16 coaches long
Well, that long black train
Took my baby back home
Train train, rolling round the bend
Train train, rolling round the bend
Well, it took my baby
Away from me again
Went down to the station
To meet my baby at the gate
Ask the station master
If her train is running late
He said no if your wait
On that old 44
I hate to tell you son
But that train don't stop her anymore
Train train, rolling round the bend
Train train, rolling round the bend
Well, it took my baby
Away from me again
Heard that whistle blowing
It was the middle of the night
When I got down to the station
The train was rolling out of site
Mystery train, rolling round the bend
Mystery train, rolling round the bend
Well, it took my baby
Away from me againThey passed an ordinance in the town they said we'd have to tear it down
That little old shack out back so dear to me
Though the health department said its day was over and dead
It will stand forever in my memory
Don't let them tear that little brown building down
Don't let them tear that precious building down
Don't let them tear that dear old building down
There's not another like it in the country or the town
It was not so long ago that I went tripping through the snow
Out to that house behind my old hound dog
Where I would sit me down to rest like a snowbird on his nest
And I'd read that Sears and Roebuck catalog
Oh I would hum a happy tune peeping through the quarter moon
As my daddy's kin had done so much before
It was in that quiet spot daily cares could be forgot
And it gave the same relief to rich and poor
Don't let them tear...
Now it was not a castle fair but I could dream of future there
Build my castle to the yellow jackets drone
I could orbit round the sun fight with General Washington
Or be a king upon a golden throne
It wasn't fancy built at all we had newspapers on the wall
It was air-conditioned in the wintertime
Oh it was just an humble hut but its door was never shut
And a man could get inside without a dime
Don't let them tear...I don't need a whole lots of money
I don't need a big fine car
I got everything that a man could want
I got more than I could ask for
I don't have to run around
I don't have to stay out all night
'Cause I got me a sweet. a sweet, lovin' woman
And she knows just how to treat me right
Oh my baby, she's alright
Oh my baby, she's clean out of sight
Don't you know that she is some kind of wonderful
Some kind of wonderful
Some kind of wonderful
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When I hold her in my arms
You know she sets my soul on fire
Ooh, when my baby kisses me
She fills my heart with desire
Oh my baby, she's alright
Oh my baby, she's clean out of sight
Don't you know that she is some kind of wonderful
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
I know that she is
She's some kind of wonderful
I'm talkin' 'bout my baby
She's some kind of wonderful
I'm talkin' 'bout my baby
She's some kind of wonderful
I'm talkin' 'bout my baby
She's some kind of wonderfulBlame it all on my roots
I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know
The last one to show
I was the last one
You thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise
And the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you
Said honey we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh I've got friends in low places
Well I guess I was wrong
I just don't belong
But then I've been there before
Everything's all right
I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey I didn't mean
To cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well I'll be as high
As that ivory tower
That you're livin' in
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh I've got friends in low places
I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh I've got friends in low places
I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh I've got friends in low places
I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay.Christmas time's a comin'

But friend it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad the first day
That she planted it was just a twig
Then the first snow came and she ran out
To brush the snow away, so it wouldn't die
Came running in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself and I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her
When I came in from working late
'Cause I would know that she'd been sittin' there
And crying over some sad and silly late late show
And honey I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be guess
You could say she saw through me and hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly and found her crying
Needlessly in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring when flowers bloom
And robins sing she went away
And honey I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
One day while I was not at home
And she was there and all alone the angels came
Now all I have is memories of honey
And I wake up nights and call her name
Now my life's an empty stage where honey lived
And honey played and love grew up
A small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed where honey loved
See the tree, how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad the first day
That she planted it was just a twigWhere is your heart tonight?
You look at me with eyes that do not see
Where is your heart tonight?
Hm, some love thief must have stolen it from me
Yes, tomorrow you'll be different
I'm hoping you'll end it all that every thing's all right
But now though I'm holding you tight
I wonder, dear, where is your heart tonight
Tomorrow you'll be differentIt's hard to find the perfect time to say something
You know is gonna change everything
Living with the shame,
It ain't nothing like the pain that I saw on her face
Now me and my pile of things
That she threw out the window,
Drowning next to me
No seven years of good can't hide the one night I forgot to wear that ring
So let it rain, let it pour, if she don't love me anymore,
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me,
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve,
Let it come down on me, let it come down on me, let it rain
Best thing I remember was the young familiar taste of someone on my lips,
It's to late to turn around,
When the shades start coming down,
The guilt you feel's the last thing on your mind
So let it rain, let it pour, if she don't love me anymore,
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me,
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve,
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me, let it rain
So let it rain, let it pour, if she don't love me anymore,
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me,
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve, just let it come down on me,
Let it come down on me, let it rain,
Ooh let it rain, ooh let it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain, ooh let it rainI'm not much to look at nothin' to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me she's funny that way
I can't save a dollar ain't got a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me she's funny that way
Though she loves to work and slave for me every day
She'd be so much better off if I went away
But why should I leave her why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me she's funny that way
Though she loves to work and slave...10-4 over and out
The way we talk sometimes you'd think our love is filled with doubt
But when we're all alone by the fireside of our home
The angry words we spoke that day have forever gone away
Then it's love we talk about to the world outside we say
10-4 over and out
Hello this is Unit 2 callin' Unit 1 this is Unit 2 tryin' Unit 1
Do you read me Unit 1 do you read me
(Yeah I read you Unit 2 I sure can read you just like a book is all
And I know what you called for I know what you're gonna say
I'm gonna be a little bit late
Well I know you're a little bit late's are usually two or three or four
Or sometimes even more hours long
And I am sick and tired of) 10-4 over and out
10-4 over and out...
This is Unit 1 callin' Unit 2 do you read me Unit 2 you better answer me Unit 2
I'm gettin' sick of foolin' around with this CB radio
I'm gonna cram this thing down your throat
(I read you mhm do I golly I read you Unit 1 loud and clear
But seems like there's a little turbulence on the line
Honey I'm sorry that I'm runnin' so late but I stopped off here
To see this friend of mine who's been awfully awfully sick
And when I got back to the car you know this radio had run my battery down
I know it's hard for you to believe)
Oh I believe you I really do believe you ole CB and you 10-4 over and out
10-4 over and out...
10-4 baby I'm gonna have to be clear with you I'm always movin' on
Oh you've never been clear in your life you was born
I'm gonna get rid of this radio it's gonna get me killed I tell you
I'm gonna have to get rid of that radio just as soon as we get home
Everybody in the country knows what we're talkin' about too
They listen in on us I know I knowWe used to have good times together
But now, I feel them slip away
It makes me cry to see love die
So sad to watch good love go bad
Remember, how you used to feel dear?
You said nothing could change your mind
It breaks my heart to see us part
So sad to watch good love go bad
Is it any wonder that I feel so blue
When I know for certain that I'm losing you?
It breaks my heart to see us part
So sad to watch good love go bad
So sad to watch good love go badDid you ever not so much that you could notice
Could you estimate how many eight or nine
Will you do it anymore as soon as you walk out the door
I just wondered did you ever all the time
Could I fix you one small no thanks I just had one
Then how about a nice big that would be just fine
Is there any special way oh no whatever you say
I just wondered have you ever all the time
Does he look like no he's taller and more handsome
Is he as old oh no he's young and in his prime
Does your mother know I'll bet oh no I haven't told her yet
I just wondered do you ever all the time
Just for old times sake no that would be much harder
Then how about well are you sure that you don't mind
Hey I know just the thing for us no I'm afraid I'll miss my bus
I just wondered did you ever all the time
I just wondered did you ever all the timeWagon wheels wagon wheels keep on a turning wagon wheels
Roll along sing your song carry me over the hill
Go along mule there's a steamer at the landin'
Waiting for this cotton to load
Go along mule the boss is understandin'
There's a pasture at the end of each road
Wagon wheels wagon wheels keep on a turning wagon wheels
Roll along sing your song wagon wheels carry me home
Wagon wheels carry me home
Go along muleBlue ain't just a word, it's a feeling
A feeling of loneliness that I can feel right now
Love has looked at me but tried to change me
I wish love would take me just for what I am
[Chorus:]
Just for what I am I want someone to love me
Someone who won't expect me to be like
Their old memory
Just for what they see, just for being me
I want someone to love me just for what I am
Crying ain't just a sound, it's a sadness
A sadness that lives with me
And follows me around
Love wants me to be someone I can't be
I wish love would take me just for what I am
[Chorus:]
I want someone to love me just for what I amyour nobody called today she hung up when I ask her nameI never thought I'd need you
But now I find I'm wrong
Come on back, sweet mama
Back where you belong
I've rambled over town
To find that I can't win
Come on back and pick me up again
Now, if I lose
(If I lose)
Let me lose
(Let me lose)
I don't care
(I don't care)
How much I lose
If I lose a hundred dollars
While I'm tryin' to win a dime?
My baby, she's got money all the time
Of all the other gals I've known
There's none to take your place
'Cause when I get into a jam
They just ain't in the race
So, now that you're back here
Let's take another round
With you here by my side
Babe, the deal just can't go down
Now, if I lose
(If I lose)
Let me lose
(Let me lose)
I don't care
(I don't care)
How much I lose
If I lose a hundred dollars
While I'm tryin' to win a dime?
My baby, she's got money all the time
Now, if I lose
(If I lose)
Let me lose
(Let me lose)
I don't care
(I don't care)
How much I lose
If I lose a hundred dollars
While I'm tryin' to win a dime?
My baby, she's got money all the timeLast night it came around again and went walking through my mind
And again it's got the best of me and I felt just like a child
After all the hurt it caused me I guess I sure have known
But I still can't leave your memory alone
No I still can't leave your memory alone it's all I've got to cling to since you've gone
Yes I know that it's over but I keep hanging on
And I still can't leave your memory alone
[ steel ]
Tonight I should make you go erase you from my mind
But I can only lose you one thought at a time
And Lord I pray the time will come when one day I'll be strong
But I still can't leave your memory alone
No I still can't leave...
No I still can't leave your memory aloneThe lights in the harbor
Don't shine for me
I'm like a lost ship
Adrift on the sea
[Chorus:]
Sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine, how I wish
You were mine again my dear
I'm on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak
Oh how did I lose you
Oh where did I fail
Why did you leave me
Always to sail
[Chorus]
Oh what I'd give just to sail back to shore
Back to your arms once more
Oh come to my rescue
Oh come here to me
Take me and keep me
Away from the sea
[Chorus]Well she gave him the last chance
For the hundreth time again
And he hears the words she said
But he can't let the truth sink in
It won't sink in
You think he woulda learned by now
No one ever showed him how
We fly, we fall, we run we crawl
We laugh, we cry
Can't stay alive between the lone
And goodbye
So we win some, we lose some
We lonesome
She looks out her window
At the thousand souls below
How easy it would be
To close her eyes and
Just let go just let go
You think we woulda learned by now
It's not like no one showed us how
We fly, we fall, we run
We crawl, we laugh, we cry
Can't stay alive between the lone
And goodbye
So we win some
We lose some we lonesome
We fly, we fall, we run
We crawl, we laugh, we cry
Can't stay alive between the lone
And goodbye
So we win some, we lose some
We lonesome
We fly
(lonesome)
We fly
(lonesome)I got those worried blues
And I got those worried blues
I got those worried blues
I got those worried blues
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
I'm going where the climate suits my clothes
Honey babe, don't leave me now
Honey babe, don't leave me now
Oh, honey babe, don't leave me now
Honey babe, don't leave me now
I got trouble in my mind
Listen to that cold whistle blow
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow
Listen to that cold whistle blow
Listen to that cold whistle blow
I'm going where I'm never been beforeA walk in the park, there will be no bother
Since we are not decision-maker
Government is the chief dealer
Oh, if they don't exist
How can I burst into laughter
A walk in the park, go look around from west to east
It is so tough being a giraffe
Can I get along well with him
He recognizes me since I were a toddler
A walk in the park, there will be no bother
Since we are not decision-maker
Government is the chief dealer
Oh, if they don't exist
How can I burst into laughter
A walk in the park, go look around from west to east
It is so tough being a giraffe
Can I get along well with him
He recognizes me since I were a toddler
A walk in the park, go look around from west to east
A walk in the park, go look around from west to easti'm losin' you
i'm losin' you
memory needs a place to land
i held my tongue to taste your hand
i'm losin' you
i'm losin' you
yellowed page and faded pen
photos lie in stillness
i'm losin' you
i'm losin' you
salty sea and mountain air
boats and trains to get us there
sailor suits and wooden toys
daddy's girl and mama's boy
i'm losin' you
losin' youI dreamed I spent my Christmas with my family
I heard the sleigh bells ringing from afar
I dreamed I helped my sisters decorate the tree
And my brother held me up to hang the star
Mama and my papa and all the kis were there
We opened up our presents then we had the family prayer
I spent a lovely Christmas with my family even if it was a Christmas dream
I dreamed I spent my Christmas with the family
And what I wouldn't give if it were so
I dreamed my mama kissed me and buttoned up my coat
And said now go and play out in the snow
Poor old papa carved the turkey and little sister cut the cake
Then we bowed our heads and all gay things we said in Jesus name and for his sake
I had a lovely Christmas with my family even if it was a Christmas dreamThe old home town looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my Mama and Papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
Then I awake and look around me
At four gray walls that surround me
And I realize, yes, I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre
On and on we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of homeIt's snowing out there in the gloaming I've sat here and watched it all night
The kids will be thrilled when they awaken and look at the fields deep and white
But the snow makes me think of my darling for he hated the snow and the cold
Now he lies in a grave back in Knoxville with a headstone that's just one year old
Won't you please make the winter go quick Lord so the flowers around him can grow
For I can't stand the thought of my darling lying there in the deepening snow
Little Jimmy climbs up on my knee now says mommy what causes the snow
And I tell the wonderful father who cares for us all here below
Then I hold him so close and I kiss him and he kissing back doesn't know
That my kiss is meant for his daddy lying there in the deepening snow
Won't you please make the winter
Lying there in the deepening snowMama preached to me, boy be a kid just as long as you can
But I was hell-bent and bound and determined to be my old man
I was ready to drive and I wanted a job
Hungry to chase my dreams
Way back when I was twelve years old going on eighteen
Those four years of college I stretched into six and a half
If I woke up in time after parties you'd catch me in class
I moved back home, stayed out, slept in
'Til one Monday morning I heard Daddy scream
You're twenty-four years old boy, going on eighteen
[Chorus]
Hey all I'm dying to do is to live
Just tryin' to take what the day has to give
Everyone wants but they don't always get what's expected of me
They say act your age, don't break no mold
Be young when you're young and old when you're old
They say I'm in the prime of my life, hell if I know what that means
In the back of my mind I'm still going on eighteen
Got the wife, got the kids, got the job, got the cars and the house
In life's little rulebook it falls under "all settled down"
But give a handful of friends a handful drinks
It's like riding a time machine
A bunch of thirty-something-year-old guys going on eighteen
[Chorus]
Now I preach to my boy be a kid just as long as you can
But he's hell-bent and determined
To be his old manWHEN YOU AND I WERE YOUNG MAGGIE
(George Johnson - James A. Butterfield)
'35 American Cowboy Music
I wander today to the hill Maggie to watch the scene below
The creek and the creaking old mill Maggie as we used to long, long ago
The green grove is gone from the hill Maggie where first the daisies sprung
That creaking old mill is still Maggie since you and I were young
Oh they say that m feeble with age Maggie my steps are my slower that then
My face is a well written page Maggie and time all alone was the pen
They say we have our different time Maggie as they hear our songs that we sung
But to me you're as fair as you were Maggie when you and I were young
When you and I were youngWell I have been a cowboy dang near all my life
That good ol' cowboy music is all I'm supposed to like
But here lately I don't know what's happening but I'm losin' control
I'm losin' control
To a little longhaired outlaw who's a ridin' somewhere deep down in my soul
He likes rock and roll
Well he rides a pinto stallion down the canyons of my mind
Makes camp beneath a memory below the timberline
Got a little electric fender guitar plugs direct into my soul
Right into my soul
Turns up the volume bends them guitar strings and plays that rock and roll
Ah and here he goes
[ guitar ]
Well I can be do a concert strummin' along just fine
Playing Little Joe The Wrangler when somethin' snaps inside my mind
And I can feel that longhaired music wellin' up from the rivers of my soul
Where the music flows
When that little longhair outlaw takes over and makes me play that rock and roll oh yeah
[ keyboards ]
Now if you like cowboy music and you don't like this song
Well I'd like to apologize if the tune kinda came out wrong
But you see I can't help myself the little longhair has got control
And he won't let go
But I'll get back to my cowboy music but sometimes you gotta play a little rock and roll
It's my turn it's about time
[ guitar ]Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us, never molested, though in the wrong
When death has come and taken our loved ones, it leaves our home so lonely and dreary
Then do we wonder why others prosper living so wicked year after year
Farther along we'll know all about it; farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up, my brother; live in the sunshine, we'll understand it all by and by
Faithful till death said our loving master; a few more days to labor and wait
Toils of the road will then seem as nothing as we sweep through the beautiful gates
Farther along we'll know all about it...
Yes, we'll understand it all by and byAll the things that I denied saying everyone had lied
That I could never ever do these things to you
I confess now that you're gone they were right I did you wrong
And all the lies you've heard about me are true
It was easy at the start to fool your trusting heart
But I didn't think I'd end up losing you
So let my mistakes be known now that you are really gone
And all the lies you've heard about me are true
[ steel ]
It was easy at the start...Love built the house that I am livin' in livin' in livin' in
Well love built the house that I am livin' in and I'm happy in my house of love
Well happy little birds are singin' in my house of love
Joy to every heart they're bringin' in my house of love
Love built the house...
Oh every day the sun shines brighter in my house of love
Every day my heart is lighter in my house of love
Love built the house...
Oh clouds have found with silver linin' in my house of love
Every day the sun keeps shinin' in my house of love
Love built the house...
One more time now love built the house...
I'm so happy in my house of love yes I'm happy in my house of loveLong ol' train cruel engineer
They took my baby and left me here
And how long will I keep these lonesome blues
How long how long
Has that evening train been gone
How long how long baby how long
Mean ol' blues come down on me
They're all around me they're all I see
But how long will I keep these lonesome blues
Cruel engineer can't you see
I need my baby back with me
Then I'd be rid of these mean ol' lonesome bluesI never thought I'd need you
But now I find I'm wrong
Come on back, sweet mama
Back where you belong
I've rambled over town
To find that I can't win
Come on back and pick me up again
Now, if I lose
(If I lose)
Let me lose
(Let me lose)
I don't care
(I don't care)

If I lose a hundred dollars
While I'm tryin' to win a dime?
My baby, she's got money all the timeI don't know you from Adam
But if you're gonna play the jukebox
Please don't play A - Eleven
I just came in here from force of habit
I don't intend to spend too much time in here
But I heard you *matchin' for the music
And if you play A- Eleven - there'll be tears
I don't know you from Adam
But if you're gonna play the jukebox
Please don't play A - Eleven
This used to be our favorite spot
And when she was here it was heaven
It was here she told me that she loved me
And she always played A - ElevenActual Delmore Brothers lyrics which are pretty much the same as Doc's who is performing with Merle Travis.

Chorus:
Blow yo whistle freight train
Take me on down the line
Blow yo whistle [yodel] (len-hee-hee)
Got rambling on my mind.

That old freight train moving along to Nashville
Hold a charm that is a charm for me
Makes me think of good old boomer days gone by
Makes me feel so lonely dont you see.
Chorus:
Blow yo whistle freight train
Take me on down the line
Blow yo whistle [yodel] (len-hee-hee)

Got a feeling that Ill want to ramble
Still I know that that can never be
Guess Ill have to listen to that old smoke stack
Singing out this lonely song for me.

WRITER A.P. CARTER
Hello central give me heaven
For I know my mother's there
And you'll find her with the angels
Over on the golden stair
She'll be glad it's me a speaking
Wont you call her for me please
For I surely want to tell her
That we're sad without her here
Hello central give me heaven
For I know my mother's there
You will find her with the angels
Over on the golden stair
Poppa dear is said and lonely
Sobbed the tearful little child
Since momma's gone to heaven
Poppa dear you do not smile
I will speak to her and tell her
That we want her to come home
You just listen while I call her
Call her through the telephone
I will answer just to please her
Yes dear heart I'll soon come home
Kiss me momma it's your darling
Kiss me through the telephoneSweetheart if you should stray a million miles away
I'll always be in love with you
And though you'll find more bliss in someone else's kiss
I'll always be in love with you
I can't do any more I've tried so hard to please
But let me thank you for such tender memories
I wish you happiness as for me sweetheart I guess
I'll always be in love with you
(I'll always be in love with you)
I can't do any moreI see the town where we were born I see the place we were raised
I see all the things you wanted that I never gave
I see sadness I see sorrow I see pain on your face
But I just can't see a stranger in my place
I can see now where we quarreled I can see now I was wrong
I can see where you might weaken and I wasn't strong
I see mem'ries of a love gone bad that time cannot erase
But I just can't see a stranger in my place
No one seems to know you quite like I do no one knows the things that make you cry
And looking back it seems I never showed you and now I lay alone and wonder why
I can see now where you might grow tired of dreams that don't come true
I can see where I have fallen short of the things I promised you
I can see now through my tear filled eyes no love on your face
But I still can't see a stranger in my placeMy life is like a country road
Forgotten two lane through my soul
The sign ahead says welcome to
My heart population you
Like old service stations and motels
My heart don't take progress well
It's seldom someone passes through
My heart population you
Oh, it's quiet now in this little one love town
Since you've left but you can't be far
And though you're gone surely it can't be for long
'Cause you've still got a place in my heart
From the freeway trucks' and buses' whine
A distant sound of modern times
But moving on ain't what we do
In my heart population you
And though you're gone surely it can't be for long
'Cause you've still got a place in my heart
The one house that was full of love
Is all run down and boarded up
But the signs won't change and here there's two
My heart population you
The other one says come back soon
My heart population youOnce in a while my mind takes a trip
Down memory lane where two fool kids
First found love in my old tempest
Girl, we were something
Ribbons in your hair and white cotton dress
Hearts on fire both scared to death
We lost our fear and our innocence
To sweet, sweet loving
Now honey, I ain't complaining
No girl, I'm just saying
Every now and then on a night like this
When south breeze blows, baby I relive
That laugh, that touch, that kiss
Oh honey, how sweet it is
Every now and then when the moon's just right
Those old feelings come back to life
And I wish I could turn back time somehow
Every now and then, I wish then was now
We parked down along dry creek road
'Burnin' love' blasting on the radio
Yeah we were green but it never showed
Baby, we were red hot
Hotter than noon in mid-July
You could have lit a fire with the flame in our eyes
We left nothing to be desired
We gave it all that we got
So honey, let's take a little spin
Turn up those old feelings
Every now and then on a night like this
When south breeze blows, baby I relive
That laugh, that touch, that kiss
Oh honey, how sweet it is
Every now and then when the moon's just right
Those old feelings come back to life
And I wish I could turn back time somehow
Yeah, every now and then, I wish then was now
Can't you feel the warm wind kicking up
That's our cue baby, sure enough
Yeah, every now and then when the moon's just right
Those old feelings come back to life
And I wish I could turn back time somehow
Yeah, every now and then, I wish then was nowDown in Louisiana where the black trees grow lives a voodoo lady named Marie Leveau
She got a black cat tooth and a mojo bone and anyone wouldn't leave her alone
She go (greeeeeee) another man done gone
She lives in a swamp in a hollow log with a one eyed snake and a three legged dog
She got a bent bony body and stringy hair
And if she ever seen you all messin' round there
She go (greeeeeee) another man done gone
And then one night when the moon was black into the swamp come Handsome Jack
A no good man like you all know when he was lookin' around for Marie Leveau
He said Marie Leveau you lovely witch gimme little charm that'll make me rich
Gimme million dollars and I tell you what I'll do this very night I'm gonna marry you
And it'll be ummmmmmm another man done gone
So Marie done some magic and she shook a little sand
Made a million dollars and she put it in his hands
Then she giggled and she wiggled and she said hey hey
I'm gettin' ready for my weddin' day
But ol' Handsome Jack he said goodbye Marie
You're too damn ugly for a rich man like me
Then Marie started numblin' her fangs started gnashin'
Her body started tremblin' and her eyes started flashin'
And she went (greeeeeee) another man done gone
So if you ever get down where the black trees grow
And meet a voodoo lady named Marie Leveau
If she ever asks you to make her your wife
Man you better stay with her for the rest of your life
Or it'll be (oheeeeeee) another man done goneSorry I'm only
Human you know me
Grown up oh no guess again
My days always
Dry up and blow away
Sometimes I could do that too
But make no mistake that
When you need a friend
You could count on anyone
But you know I'll defend
The tragedy that we knew as
The end
Progress, changing
Growing then giving up
Somehow we're never quite prepared
But I understand it
When you need a friend
You could count on anyone
But you know I'll defend
The tragedy that we knew as
The end
So taking you with me would be like
Taking all your money to the grave
It does no good to anyone especially
The one you're trying to save
But it's so hard not to save
When you need a friend
You could count on anyone
But you know I'll defend
The tragedy that we knew as
The endBrown doves on the wire, do they ever tire
Up in the eggshell sky
I know if it was me, wings a take you far
The burden of flight is ours
Even that the sun in your eyes
Some things are hard to find
You could go the rest of your life
?Til the fountain of youth runs dry
Ever in pursuit of another clue
The sea in response is blue
Take a look around, have you any doubt
The heart is responding too
Even that the sun in your eyes
Are some things are hard to find
And you could go the rest of your life
?Til the fountain of youth runs dry
Comes another freeze, all the barren trees
Under the eggshell sky
They may disappear, splendor of the years
Unknowable without tears
Even that the sun in your eyes
Some things are hard to find
And you could go the rest of your life
?Til the fountain of youth runs dry
?Til the fountain of youth runs dry
?Til the fountain of youth runs dry
?Til the fountain of youth runs dry
?Til the fountain of youth runs dry
?Til the fountain of youth runs dry
?Til the fountain of youth runs dryI tore my letter up, I couldn't even start
To tell you what's really here in my heart
There's only so much that words can say
So I send you a piece of this beautiful day
Oh, I want you to know that I took a rainbow
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took some flowers in the spring, made a sweet clover ring
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took a song from the lark - the moon from the dark
A spark from the sparklin' dew
With a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love
I sent 'em off in a letter to you
I took the mornin' sun peekin' through the trees
And the dandelion silk tangled in the breeze
I folded 'em up - sealed 'em with a kiss
It's the kind of letter that you can't resist
Oh, I want you to know that I took a rainbow
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took some flowers in the spring, made a sweet clover ring
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took a song from the lark - the moon from the dark
A spark from the sparklin' dew
With a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love
I sent 'em off in a letter to you
In a day or two - just you wait and see
You're gonna get a special delivery
You'll know the way I feel - there can't be any doubt
When you open it up and let the love spill out
Oh, I want you to know that I took a rainbow
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took some flowers in the spring, made a sweet clover ring
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took a song from the lark - the moon from the dark
A spark from the sparklin' dew
With a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love
I sent 'em off in a letter to youThis world's enought to break a man's heart
Make him question who's in charge
And then you ask me to believe
What I can't see
My T.V. sold me some sin
Said anything goes, so I bought in
I've tried it all a time or two
Didn't have much use for you
I've said your name in vain before
I've let the devil drive my Ford
Read Jesus save on a bathroom door
Just before I passed out
How come you didn't strick me dead
Sent me and angel insted
She sing in the choir
And I'm hell on the preacher
But God you got you one more believer
She lays out the Sunday clothes I wear
Without her I ain't got a prayer
God you got you a good one there
Shinin' your light
And I'm no expert on the word
I can't quote you chapter and verse
But I've heard you love the worst of ones too
And I'm the proof
I've let the devil drive my Ford
Read Jesus save on a bathroom door
Just before I passed out
How come you didn't strick me dead
Sent me and angel insted
She sing in the choir
And I'm hell on the preacher
But God you got you one more believer
I've let the devil drive my Ford
Read Jesus save on a bathroom door
Just before I passed out
How come you didn't strick me dead
Sent me and angel insted
She sing in the choir
And I'm hell on the preacher
But God you got you one more believer
Oh God you got you one more believerTonight in a bar alone I'm sitting apart from the laughter and the cheer
While scenes from the past rise before me just watching the bubbles in my beer
A vision of someone who loved me brings along silent tears to my eyes
Oh I know that my life has been a failure just watching the bubbles in my beer
I'm seeing the road that I've traveled a road paved with heartaches and tears
And I'm seeing the past that I've wasted while watching the bubbles in my beer
As I think of the heart that I've broken and the chances I know have passed me by
And the dreams that I've made now are empty as empty as the bubbles in my beerA banker and a farmer discuss the bottom line,
It ain't rained and all the crops are dying on the vine.
Give me more time.
You gotta give me more time.
That farm's been in my family going on a hundred years.
We've pulled through hard times before with blood sweat and tears.
Give me more time,
I need more time.
Oh, what would he give for a little more time?
Two lovers at a table candlelight and wine,
One's looking for an answer the other one can't find.
Give me more time, You gotta give me more time.
She says "You know I love you but my heart's in a bind,
Afraid you?re gonna leave me if I don't make up my mind."
Give me more time, I gotta have more time.
Some have barely any, some too much on their hands.
Some would give anything to have it back again.
A patient and his doctor meet behind closed doors,
You kidding me? How could this be, I'm only 24. Give me more time,
You gotta give me more time, give me more time.In black and white, unspoken words
Sitting by and as hard as stone
The terms of greed
one pact thats kept by thieves
Will live their part for the rest of our years
The change of address
Change of lent
Change of linen
To hide the shame
The change of mind,
Could change the way you feel
The painful truth
Is all to real
[Chorus]
What can I say
To change your heart
Oh tell me, in simple words
The rain of hope, to the light this storm
What can I say
To change you heart
I live my life
I live my alone
Cant help but think you'd come back home
But I cant forget a drink and then I cry
Said no forgiveness in your heart
She'll never try
[Chorus]
Well meeting friends
Don't understand what wont let go
We start again
I cant explain, the dream the spot that guides
One day we'll wake up, side by side
[Chorus]
What can I say
To change you heartIf my heart had windows you'd see a heart full of love just for you
A tear may appear when I hold you near but that's for the sweet things you do
If my heart had windows you'd see a heart full of love just for you
By your side I'll stay till we're old and gray reminiscin' young moments we knew
If my heart had windows you'd see a heart full of love just for you
A thief couldn't steal the joy that I feel heaven for me has come true
If my heart had windows you'd see a heart full of love just for you
If my heart had windows you'd see a heart full of love just for youTraveling down this long lonesome highway
I'm so lonesome I could cry
Memories of how we once loved each other
And now you are saying goodbye
On and on I'll follow my darling
And I wonder where she can be
On and on I'll follow my darling
And I wonder if she ever thinks of me
I've cried, I've cried for you little darling
It breaks my heart to hear your name
My friends they also love you my darling
And they think that I am to blame
On and on I'll follow my darling
And I wonder where she can be
On and on I'll follow my darling
And I wonder if she ever thinks of me
I have to follow you my darling
I can't sleep when the sun goes down
By your side is my destination
The road is clear and that's where I'm bound
On and on I'll follow my darling
And I wonder where she can be
On and on I'll follow my darling
And I wonder if she ever thinks of meThe baby cries I could almost die from lonesome
The late show's gone and the coffee's on I think I reach some
Somewhere out there my love you share but your thoughts are far from home
But when the lights on Broadway go off and every honky tonk is closed up
My arms stay open late so you'll come home
What you do is wrong but my love stays strong for you
I don't think I'll change a thing at all I might lose you
Though it's almost dawn and you're still not at home I'll wait here patiently
For the lights to my love never go off and the door to my heart don't close up
My arms stay open late so you'll come home
My arms stay open late so you'll come homeCan you not see what you've done?
You gave your heart away like that.
I didn't want to fall in love with anyone, but you did.
I can still hear the song,
The melody behind the kiss you gave me.
You were wrong, I was right so I walked away,
And left you there, alone
I got so tired of talkin' on the telephone,
How many times would we say the words goodbye
I made mistakes, and one was telling you that I'd be there,
When telling time had come,
I should've said I didn't care.
Oh, the time I would have saved,
If I had been less willing to accommodate,
You'd been a little less likely to cry.
You go back to the high life,
And I'll go back to the low.
I should've known, but now I know
There'll be no word from you,
Describing how it felt to go through what I put you through.
It all makes perfect sense.
The way you cut the rope,
That kept you dangling from such pitiful amounts of hope
I would have cut it too.WE'LL GET AHEAD SOMEDAY
Duet by Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner
Writer Mack Magaha
Copyright 1967
We'll get ahead somedays we'll get ahead someday
If the sun comes up and my wife cuts down we'll get ahead someday
Well I get up early work hard all day listen to the troubles of my friends
But I don't realize till I get home whan an awful shape we're in
The car's wore out kids need shoes got a bill from a doctor today
The landlord said you'll get out tomorrow if you don't get me some pay
We'll get ahead someday...
The paper says there's a sale downtown I gotta have some money today
Well there's things at home that's never been used you bought last bargain day
Well you go out one Saturday night just spend too much money on wine
Well I work hard all week long and I gotta have a little fun sometimes
We'll get ahead someday...
If the sun comes up and my wife cuts down we'll get ahead somedayI left home a long long time ago
In a tin can for the road
With a suitcase and some songs
Chasing miles through the night time
Making tracks with no time for looking back
To the place where I belong
How these days grow long
But I'm on my way back home
It's been hard to be away
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
How these days grow long
When you're sad, you know I wish I could be there
To make your sorrows disappear
And set your troubles free
It's not fair for me to be this far from you
But I promise to stay true
Wherever I might be
Time keeps burning, the whels keep on turning
Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting my days
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
How these days grow long
Time keeps burning on
How these days grow long
Now I'm lost in a sea of sunken dreams
While the sound of drunken screams echoes in the night
But I know all of this will come to pass
And I'll be with you at last forever by your side
How these days grow long
But I'm on my way back home
It's been hard to be away
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
Time keeps burning, the wheels keep on turning
Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting my days
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
How these days grow long
Time keeps burning on
How these days grow longI can no longer take it
I'm findin' it hard to do.
Makin' believe I'll make it
Without You.
How am I gonna shake it
I can't tell my heart what to do
Why even try to fake it
Without You
Without You to keep me goin'
This emptiness just keeps on growin'
Without You
How am I to find my way
Where am I to go
How could you just walk away
Takin' more of me
Than you could ever know.
I'm gonna have to make it
I made it before without you,
The love that I won
I'm not strong enough to lose.
I never thought you'd break it
But you broke our love in two
I've got no place to take it
Without You.
Without You to keep me goin'
This emptiness just keeps on growin'
Without You
How am I to find my way
Where am I to go
How could you just walk away
Takin' more of me
Than you could ever know.My answer machine is feelin' lonely and blue
'Cause it ain't had a message in an hour or two
And my fax machine has tears in its eyes
'Cause there ain't no words burnin' through its wires
Is it something I did
Is it something I said
Is it something I sang
Or is it something you read
Come clean with me or else instead
I'm gonna wash my hands of you
Hey like Elvis said, "We're goin' separate ways"
I'm gonna wash my hands of youSitting in the breakfast nook,
Flipping through a saucy book, browsing for a bit of titillation.
Morning is warming on your mouth,
Last days of direct sunlight for this part of the house.
Move into the great room.
Get the clean corn broom, sweeping up a sad old pillar of salt.
You're feeling glummer as summer dies off.
Something was released with autumn's first cough.
Matter seems immaculate until it is consumed or distressed.
See her with her kitchen soap.
Cleaning up the breakfast she knows it's never finished 'till the others replenished.
Propped up on the mantel piece, trophies stuffed in a life that flies.
A couple of seconds can be a long time if'n its froze.Here we all are at the end of "the century of beauty lost".
We greedily ate what you gave us, the rest we tossed.
We've trapped all your rivers, paved every pass,
Pulled at your sky till we caused it to rip.
But you've got Jimi Hendrix so lets call it an even split.
I've met a girl who has turned my whole world upside down.
The stars i once stretched for, now litter the ground.
I am cursed by too little, or is it too much belief,
In the strength of another man's words.
But I've got a girl, thank you lord.
Here we all are at the start of another thousand years.
All those love stories, yet to be told.
Ours is this river asleep at our feet,
Blessed by this wet autumn day.
Here we all are(Wait, let me get the sweat off my fingers)
You crawl back tonight saying you miss me
With your tail between your legs
What's going on here ain't no mystery
Still, it's fun watching you beg
Settling down won't come natural
But think it over
I hear you found someone who's true
That she treats you fine
Now that poor girl's love won't do
And you're wanting some of mine
Settling down won't come natural
But think it over
I know why you cheat on me
(Always running 'round and 'round)
Every time I turn my back
(You'll never change)
Every woman loves a bit differently
(But hurts the same)
That's what keeps you going
That's what keeps you trappedSince you've gone to Heaven I don't like coming home
But I can't stand the thought of mom in that big house alone
She can't keep it up, she really ought to sell
Oh that house without you in it is nothing but a shell
Since you've gone to Heaven, the whole world's gone to hell
Everybody says that Billy is looking more and more like you
But he won't talk about you until he's had a few
He dropped out of college, he's in and out of jail
Had to pawn your pocket watch last month to post his bail
Since you've gone to Heaven, the whole world's gone to hell
And I hate you had to leave us, but glad you didn't live to see this
The broken pieces of the family you made
Mama's looking so much older, baby brother can't stay sober
I bet you're rolling over in your grave
Since you've gone to Heaven, they shut the sawmill down
Guys you worked for thirty years with have all moved out of town
There's signs in every store front, seems like everything's for sale
They say the market's bouncing back, but it's sure hard to tell
Since you've gone to Heaven, the whole world's gone to hell
And I hate you had to leave us, but glad you didn't live to see this
The broken pieces of the family you made
Mama's looking so much older, baby brother can't stay sober
I bet you're rolling over in your grave
Since you've gone to Heaven, I've struggled with goodbye
And broke a lot of promises I made the day you died
Wish I was more like you, less like myself
And I wish that I could talk to you 'cause I could use your help
Since you've gone to Heaven the whole world's gone to hellThis title is instrumental, so there are no lyricsIn 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip.
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in the town of New Orleans.
[Chorus:]
We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin.
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago.
We fired once more and they began to runnin' on
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
We looked down the river and we see'd the British come.
And there must have been a hundred of'em beatin' on the drum.
They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring.
We stood by our cotton bales and didn't say a thing.
[Chorus]
Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
If we didn't fire our muskets 'til we looked 'em in the eye
We held our fire 'til we see'd their faces well.
Then we opened up with squirrel guns and really gave 'em ... well
[Chorus]
Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go.
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.**
We fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down.
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round.
We filled his head with cannon balls, and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off, the gator lost his mind.
[Chorus]
Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go.
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.**Where have you gone my little boy little boy where have you gone my sonny my own
Turn around you're two turn around then you're four
Turn around you're a young man going out the door
Where have you gone my little girl little girl
Pigtails and petticoats where have you gone
Turn around you're tiny turn around then you're grown
Turn around you're a young wife with babes of your own
Where have they gone our little ones little ones
Where have they gone our children our own
Turn around and they're young turn around and they're old
Turn around and they've gone and we've no one to hold
Turn around and they're youngShe pushed the door open
Turned the light switch on
She sleeps alone in our empty bed
I've been gone too long
Baby, baby, tomorrow
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I turn on some music
Miles and miles and miles
Another cup of coffee
To wake my weary eyes
Baby, baby, tomorrow
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I put the key in the back door
Walk quietly up the stairs
I'm gonna kiss her on the forehead
Until she realizes I'm right there
Baby, baby, tomorrow
Baby, baby, tomorrow
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming homeI'm just a plain ol' country kid and I like to do what's right
Just like any other boy I like to hold 'em tight
Sometimes they got resistance but no matter how I tried
Then a cute little gal just looks at me with a gleam in her eye
And I'll say honey, you better not do that and she'll say why
And I'll say cause you just better not do that
When I was in a country school I always had a girl
They'd laugh and giggle awful cute and put me in a whirl
And everyday at recess time they followed me outside
I'd scratch my head and wonder are they ever satisfied
And I'd say honey you better not do that and she'd say why
And I'd say cause you just better not do that
Now when I was a little older I went to the country dance
I went to have a little fun I was a thinkin' bout romance
But the dim lights just lured upon and they'd snuggle up to me
I knew I couldn't last too long I'm human you see
And I'd say baby you better not do that and she'd say why
And I'd say cause you just better not do that
Well that's the way my life has been ain't it a cryin' shame
How much longer can I last if I keep playin' the game
Sometimes I don't know who I am do they know what they're doin'
I'm afraid in years to come that girls will be my ruin
And I'll say honey you better not do that and she'd say why
And I'll say cause you just better not do that and she'd say why George
And I'll say ah well um it's alright if you do thatI've got to leave that man alone that makes a fool of me
I've got to leave while I've still got my pride
If I'd stay around much longer it'll be too late for me
I'd better listen to that voice I hear inside
That man doesn't love you girl can't you see he's just using you
That man doesn't love you girl that man ain't the man for you
I'd seen the way he looks at girls with hunger in his eyes
And I felt the coldness of his lips on mine
He still tells me he loves me but I can tell he lies
Cause I hear that little voice inside my mind
That man doesn't love you girl...
That man ain't the man for youEverybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set me free
Oh lonesome me
A bad mistake I'm making bout just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun an paint the town
A love sick fool that's blind and just can't see
Oh lonesome me
I'll bet she's not like me
She's out an fancy free
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so
And brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms
Well there must be some way
I can lose these lonesome blue
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I've thought of everything from A to Z
Oh lonesome me
Well I bet she's not like me
She's out and fancy free
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so
And brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back into my arms
Well there must be some way
I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I've thought of everything from A to Z
Oh lonesome me
Oh lonesome me.When my way growith dear precious Lord linger near when my life is almost gone
Hear my cry hear my call hold my hand last I fall
Take my hand precious Lord lead me home
Precious Lord take my hand lead me on let me stand I am tired I am weak I am worn
Through the storm through the night lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord lead me home
When the shadows appear and the night drawith near and the day is past and gone
At the river I stand guide my feet hold my hand
Take my hand precious Lord lead me home
Precious Lord take my hand[ with Buddy Alan ]
Let the world keep on a turnin' let the fire keep on a burnin'
Let our love keep on a growin' to the sky
Let our ship of love keep sailin' keep the storm clouds far away and
Hand in hand we'll walk together side by side
Please don't pay me attention to someone that they should mention
As they saw me in the arms of Mary Jane
Oh it's plain they're only jealous and their hearts are filled with malice
Their intention is to only bring us pain
Let the world keep on a turnin'...
[ steel ]
When they try to cause us trouble we'll politely pop their pubble
By ignoring any gossip they might start
So let the north wind keep a blowin' we'll be safe cause we'll be a knowin'
That our love is safely locked inside our hearts
Let the world keep on a turnin'...
Hand in hand we'll walk together side by side
Hand in hand we'll walk together side by side[Chorus]
Oh me, oh my, sweet baby said goodbye
Oh no one else could take her place in my life
Oh we had something good
So tell me why she would
Go and make me cry, oh me,
Oh my, sweet baby said goodbye
I remember how she'd hold me
And say she'd stay forever true
Back then the future looked so rosey
But tonight it's lookin' mighty blue
[Chorus]
Don't know what I didn't give her
That she gets from someone new
I only know how much I miss her
And wish she hadn't broke my heart in twoWedding bells rang out today but not for me
They rang for somebody else in my old used to be
Had to catch a train I couldn't stand the news I'm on a honeymoon with the blues
I thought her invitation was an answer to my note
Saying I was sorry for the unkind words I spoke
But it's just a one way ticket that I can't refuse to a honeymoon with the blues
So roll on eight wheel driver take me far far away
A thousand miles or more would be just fine
The blues and I are celebratin' our wedding day
And we have no special or particular place in mind
I know that we're not headed for Niagara Falls
But any destination would just lead me to four walls
Well I spend weary nights wearing out my shoes on my honeymoon with the blues
[Musical Interlude]
Never thought I'd take this trip without a girl of my dreams
Shoes and drives what I've had in mind
So Mister Engineer won't you turn on the steam leaving all my dreams away behind
Say porter I'd like to order drinks for two
I know that I'm alone but then that's nothing new
While I'm celebratin' here's a drink for you on my honeymoon with the blues
I'm on a honeymoon with the bluesLately I've been thinking about this crazy life I live
All the things that I've been given
And just what I have to give
Oh I may not be a rich man in a lot of people's eyes
But I found the treasure I can share
Inside this heart of mine
[Chorus]
Oh I'd like to be remembered by the smiles on your face
And if troubles come to find you you can always look my way
I will be right there beside you as you travel down life's road
I hope I leave you laughing when the curtains close
I'd like to give you silver around your clouds of gray
Some gold that you can cling to and the memories we made
And if by chance tomorrow Heaven's angels call
And I go on before you to the greatest show of all
[Chorus]
A merry heart would make good medicine the Bible tells us so
That's what I try to bring to you at each and every show
[Chorus]
I'd sure like to leave here laughing when the curtains closeNippers Corner
Bumping down the county road, some sneaky in the beat
Agnes sighs and checks her thighs shes movingmovin through the
Heat, it takes a heavy toll that the people love to pay
So get your roll of dimes and your sippin wine
Cause forgettin times the order of the day
Yellow bus drops Gospel Jones, he lost that eye in 43
With a soggy smile, hell preach a while about losin
Losin nothing but a state of mind like a roll of dice,
You gotta let em fall where they may
But the gospels gold is in the glass he holds
And aint nobody gonna take it away
Token stories, trading glory for the flame
Stumbling softly, fire gently soothes the soul
Detroit hank looking for some love raises a glass to Lemon Klein
Looking bold, shes off parole and gleaming
Scheming from behind a different bar and a darker star
Where everyone takes a seat
Cos when yer fightin time & yer soaked with wine
You forget that you can leave
Gospels watching Agnes dancing near the flame
Stumbling softly, fire gently soothes the soul
Heated prancing she keeps dancing with pain
Gospelssinging Nippers Corners gonna blow
Bumpin down the county road, some sneaky in the beat
Agnes sighs and drops her eyes
Shes movinThe answer my friend is blowing in the wind
How many roads must a man walk down before they call him a man
Yes and how many seas must a white dove sail before she sleeps in the sand
Yes and how many times must a cannonballs fly before they're forever banned
The answer my friend is blowing in the wind the answer is blowing in the wind
[ banjo ]
How many times must a man look up before he sees the sky
Yes and how many ears must one man howl before he can hear people cry
Yes and how many deaths will it take till he knows that too many people have died
The answer my friend is blowing in the wind the answer is blowing in the wind
[ harmonica ]
How many years can a mountain exist before it is washed to the sea
Yes and how many years can some people exist before they're allowed to be free
Yes and how many times can a man turn his head and pretend he just doesn't see
The answer my friend is blowing in the wind the answer is blowing in the windGirl, I know you dont really know me
Still I want you to listen closely, this might sound crazy
But after all, isnt love like that, I would be crazy
To let this moment pass
What if I don't say what's on my mind and you walk away
I might live out my life and never feel this way
What if you are the one that I'm meant to love, what if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love dont come twice
And girl, take a chance, time is unfolding
We could be blessed without even knowing, just for a minute
Close your eyes and dont take another breath
Cause what if you miss it and it never comes again
And what if you dont say whats on your minds and I walk away
You might live out your lives and never feel this way
What if I'm the one that you're meant to love and what if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love dont come twice
I dont wanna wake up by myself
Years from now wishin that Id told you what I felt
Your eyes are a window to your soul
If you dont open up, I may never know
What if we dont say whats on our minds and we walk away
We might live out our lives and never feel this way
What if I am the one and you are the one, what if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love dont come twice
Oh girl, what if you are the one and I am the one
What if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love dont come twiceI wandered again to my home in the mountains,
Where in life's early dawn I was happy and free,
I looked for my friends but I never could find 'em,
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
Chorus
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
No Mother or Dad not a friend could I see,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
They've all moved away said the voice of a stranger,
To a beautiful home by the bright Crystal Sea,
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in Heaven,
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
Repeat Chorus(Dolly Parton)
I know this dress I'm wearing doesn't hide the secret I've tried concealing
When he left he promised me he'd be back by the time it was revealing
The sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow o'er the fields of clover
And time is running out for me, I wish that he would hurry down from Dover
He's been gone so long, when he left the snow was deep upon the ground
And I have seen a spring and summer pass and now the leaves are turning brown
At any time a tiny face will show itself 'cause waiting's almost over
But I won't have a name to give it if he doesn't hurry down from Dover, from Dover, from Dover
My folks weren't understanding, when they found out they sent me from the home place
My daddy said if folks found out he'd be ashamed to ever show his face
My mamma said I was a fool, she did not believe it when I told her
Momma, everything's gonna be all right 'cause soon he would be coming down from Dover
I found a place to stay out on a farm takin' care of that old lady
She never asked me nuthin' so I never talked to her about my baby
I sent a messgae to my mom with a name and address of Ms. ol' Grover
And to make sure he got that information when he came down from Dover
I loved him more than anything and I could not refuse him when he needed me
He was the only one I'd loved and I just can't believe that he was usin' me
He wouldn't leave me here like this, I know it can't be so, it can't be over
He wouldn't make me go through this alone, he'll be coming down from Dover
My body aches the time is here it's lonely in this place where I'm lying
Our baby has been born, but something's wrong, it's too still, I hear no crying
I guess in some strange way she knew she'd never have a father's arms to hold her
So dying was her way of tellin' me he wasn't coming down from Dover, from Dover, from Dover
Down from DoverHold on like there's no tomorrow.
There can be no sorrow,
Right here where we stand.
And living only for this moment
All we've ever wanted,
Is right here in our hands.
And some will say that we're sure to fall,
Try and build their walls between us.
No way over it, no way around it.
If we want it, we have to go through it.
Fight for a love and the world tries to break us down.
But the world will bend,
An' the fight will end.
Love will always win.
Hold on till we see tomorrow,
There is time to borrow,
Till we own our own.
Walk on and our hearts will lead us.
But our hearts will need us,
To be steady and strong.
So we can stand and face the fire.
Burning higher and higher.
No way over it, no way around it.
If we want it, we have to go through it.
Fight for a love and the world tries to break us down.
But the world will bend,
An' the fight will end.
Love will always win.
No: we know that a rainbow ends,
Beyond dark skies.
No way over it, no way around it, no.
If we want it, we have to go through it.
Fight for a love and the world tries to break us down.
But the world will bend,
An' the fight will end.
An' the world will bend,
An' the fight will end.
Love will always win.Banjo...
I'm from the country, you're from the city
I drive a truck, you think that's silly
But there's another side of me you know you'd like to see
Ain't that right? Oh that's right.
I got my money, in my pocket
A girl beside me, a little bottle rocket
There's a finger on her lips and a swagger in her hips
Tonight, tonight, tonight
I'm wearing camo, y'all hastag this
This party's raging, you won't wanna miss
All my buddies turning up, parking lot is full of trucks
Hang on tight, hang on tight, oh my, my, my
And I say "Hey, I, want you girl"
You make my heart, heart flutter like a tilt-a-whirl
It's getting freaky on the floor feel that rumbling sound
I might have grown up in a barn
But I can bring down the house
And we go down, down, down, down
The club goes round, round, round, round
We take it to the ground, ground, ground, ground
Oooh tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
And we go down, down, downtown
The club goes round, round, round, round
We take it to the ground, ground, ground, ground
Oooh tonight
And I say "Hey, I, want you girl"
You make my heart, heart flutter like a tilt-a-whirl
It's getting freaky on the floor feel that rumbling sound
I might have grown up in a barn
But I can bring down the house
And we go down, down, down, down
The club goes round, round, round, round
We take it to the ground, ground, ground, ground
Oooh tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Girl you're so wonderful, why don't we ditch this floor
Head out to the barn, I'll hold you in my arms
I'll show you the stars
Oooh, oooh...
"Hey, I, want you girl"
You make my heart flutter like a tilt-a-whirl
It's getting freaky on the floor feel that rumbling sound
I say "Hey, I, want you girl"
You make my heart, heart flutter like a tilt-a-whirl
It's getting freaky on the floor feel that rumbling sound
I might have grown up in a barn
But I can bring down the houseHey, I'm a man, I'm a guy, I'm a dude
I'm a dose of double trouble if I get attitude
You can see I'm hard workin' by the sweat on my brow
If I don't know somethin' about it better bet I'll learn how
I been tattooed by a few battle scars
No, I ain't somebody, somebody can push too far
You're just a shade over five foot two
Oh, but girl with just a look you get me shaking in my shoes
You say jump and I'll say how high
You say do and I don't ask why
You get a lock and baby I'll be the key
That's what loving you means to me
You toss the stick and baby I'll fetch it
You set the time and girl I'll stretch it
I'll be your everything from A to Z
That's what loving you means to me
Well, I could live to be a hundred and I'll never understand
The mystifying power woman has over man
I could set my mind to walk across a bed of hot coals
But the thought of life without you makes my blood run cold
I remember declaring as a younger man
That there weren't a woman out there who could fence me in
But you got me wrapped up like a belt in a buckle
Down on my knees girl you got me crying uncle
You say jump and I'll say how high
You say do and I don't ask why
You get a lock and baby I'll be the key
That's what loving you means to me
You toss the stick and baby I'll fetch it
You set the time and girl I'll stretch it
I'll be your everything from A to Z
That's what loving you means to me
Well, you got me wrapped up like a belt in a buckle
Down on my knees girl you got me crying uncle
You say jump and I'll say how high
You say do and I don't ask why
You get a lock and baby I'll be the key
That's what loving you means to me
You toss the stick and baby I'll fetch it
You set the time and girl I'll stretch it
And I'll be your everything from A to Z
That's what loving you means to meHis old man was a rebel yeller
Bad boy to the bone
He say, can't trust a coloured feller'
He'd judge em' by the tone of their skin
And he was raised to think like his dad
Their mind full of hate
On the road to no where fast
'Till the greats of god got in his way
And he saw the light and hit his knees
And cried and said a prayer
He rose up a brand new man
Left the old one right there
Here's to the strong
Thanks to the brave
Don't give up hope
Some people change
Against all odds
Against the grave
Love finds a way
Some people change
She was born with her mothers
Guess you could say it's in her blood
She hates that she's gotta have it
She fills a glass up
She'd love to kill that bottle
But all she can think about is a better life
A second chance
And everyone she's letting down
She throws that bottle down
Here's to the strong
Thanks to the brave
Don't give up hope
Some people change
Against all odds
Against the grey
Love finds a way
Some people change
Thank god for those who make it
Love be the light
(Some people change)
Here's the the strong
Thanks to the brave
Don't give up hope
Some people change
Against all odds
Against the grey
Love finds away
Some people change
(Some people change)
Here's the the strong
(Thanks to the brave)
Don't give up hope
Some people change
Against all odds
Against the grey
Love finds away
Some people changeWalk down Marva road a stranger
Threw my stone far across the bay
Sent my son to a foreign ocean,
And dreamed of my home so far away
The darkness split to see a soldier
Struck by the spinning of the beacon's light
Take your tune he said "Treat it tender
And make good use of it tonight"
Sing a love song for the first to fall
Keep singing 'til they fight no more
Tell my love I'll be waiting there
In Dover, Delaware
Dover, Delaware
Dark and grey, cold Atlantic
Dark and grey stand the ships in line
Waiting for another tide turn
Sent to fight for one more time
Sing a love song for the first to fall
Keep singing 'til they fight no more
Tell my love I'll be waiting there
In Dover, Delaware
Dover, Delaware
Watch the shore fade behind me
Watch the smoke from the grey ship stack
Watch the cannon and the bomb fall
And when it's done they'll bring me back
Sing a love song for the first to fall
And keep singing 'til they fight no more
Tell my love I'll be waiting there
In Dover, Delaware
Dover, Delaware
Sing a love song for the first to fall
Keep singing 'til they fight no more
Tell my love I'll be waiting there
In Dover, Delaware
Dover, Delaware
In Dover, Delaware
Dover, DelawareBaby hit the back door
Breathin' real heavy
Said the boys in the alley
Wouldn't leave her alone
Mama did her make-up in a terrible hurry
She finally got ready
But the boys were gone
Mama don't you worry,
Night's approachin'
There's a hole in heaven
Where some sin slips through
Just close your eyes and dream real steady
Maybe just a little will spill on you
Dark don't lie
Dreams come true
Could be a few will see you through
Old lady Rose, lookin' down her nose
At lonely Miss Lily hiding in the hall
Lily's just praying for the trial to be over
Lady Rose just waiting for the axe to fall
Show me off on the way to town
The sky's still shiny
And the earth's still brown
Tell the judge I'm ready for the vases
Gonna dance in their faces
When the guitar sounds
Won't be long
I won't be gone
Been leaning toward the shadows all along
Those in the know say so it goes
You plan on reapin', you better sow
You plan on sleepin',
You better keep movin'
Sleepin' ain't allowed around here,
You know
Snake eyes cry
Boxcars sigh
Seven's stuck in the middle
Just wonderin' why
Dark don't lie
Dreams come true
All it takes is one or two
Maybe just a few will see you throughI'm gonna get high
And it ain't no lie
Swing along and have a ball
I'm gonna get high
Oh me, oh my
Nobody know why
Oh my baby, don't you cry
I'm gonna get high
Ain't no need if no one tryin' to shame me
What I've stayed I've got and who could blame me
Oh yeah
I'm gonna get high
I'll do it or die
Swing along and have a ball
I'm gonna get high
I'm gonna get high
And it ain't no lie
Swing along and have a ball
I'm gonna get high
Oh me, oh my
Nobody know why
Oh my baby, don't you cry
I'm gonna get high
Ain't no need if no one tryin' to shame me
What I've stayed I've got and who could blame me
Oh yeah
I'm gonna get high
I'll do it or die
Swing along and have a ball
I'm gonna get high
I'm gonna get high
I'll do it or die
Swing along and have a ball
I'm gonna get high
Swing along and have a ball
I'm gonna get high
Swing along and have a ball
I'm gonna get highThe wheels of love turn around and around
Keep on rollin' 'til you've found
The perfect partner, somebody just right
To have and hold every day and every night
So she's halfway to Texas with all of your dreams
The world ain't as bad as what it might seem
You got a whole lot of living, honey, left to do
There's still a whole lot of love inside of you
The wheels of love turn around and around
They'll take you for a ride like a merry-go-round
Don't let the heartache hold you down
When there's plenty of love to left be found
On the wheels, ridin' on the wheels of love
Catch you a ride, imagine what you might find
Just the right girl at just the right time
Ready and waiting, she'll look you in the eyes
Ah, but the wheels of love will never compromise
So she broke your heart, honey don't look back
You got to keep on rollin' down the track
And maybe the next time you'll keep your feet on the ground
When the wheels of love spin you around
The wheels of love turn around and around
They'll take you for a ride like a merry-go-round
Don't let the heartache hold you down
When there's plenty of love left to be found
On the wheels, ridin' on the wheels of love
The wheels of love turn around and around
They'll take you for a ride like a merry-go-round
Don't let the heartache hold you down
When there's plenty of love left to be found
On the wheels, ridin' on the wheels of love
Oh, the wheels
Ridin' on the wheels of loveWild wind, take me home
To the mists of down below
I'll be flying come September day
With no borders in my way
You'll find me home until the May sun burns
The heavy mists of down below
Refrain:
I see the rivers flooding strong
And people wishing they belonged
Free for anywhere they want to go
When they pray they can look to the sky
And they'd see me as I pass by
Heading to the mists of down below
Without fields ripe from rain
There is no way to feed my pain
Until I fly to mists of down below
But down below is not my fate
There is no land from where I came
Not even mists of old Mexico
RefrainWish that I was on old Rocky Top down in the Tennessee hills
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top ain't no telephone bills
Once I had a man on Rocky Top half bear the other half cat
Wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop and I still dream about that
Oh Rocky Top, you'll always be home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top, Rocky Top, Tennessee Rocky Top, Tennessee
Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top lookin' for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top, reckon they never will
Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top, dirt's too rocky by far
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top get their corn from a jar
Oh Rocky Top, you'll always be home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top, Rocky Top, Tennessee Rocky Top, Tennessee
Here we go now play, yeah
And here comes Charlie McCoy, yeah
I've had years of trapped up city life trapped like a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a pity life can't get simple again
Oh Rocky Top, you'll always be home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top, Rocky Top, Tennessee Rocky Top, Tennessee
Rocky Top, TennesseeLong distance information give me Memphis Tennessee
Help me find the party try to get in touch with me
She could not leave her number but I know who placed the call
Cause my uncle took the message and he wrote it on the wall
Help me operator get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd called me here from Memphis Tennessee
Her home is on the southside high up on a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge
[ harmonica ]
The last time I saw my Marie she was waving me goodbye
Hurry home drops on her cheeks that trickled from her eyes
We were torn apart because her mom could not agree
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee
Help me operator more than this I cannot add
Only that I miss her so and all the fun we had
Marie is only six years old get the message please
Help to put me through to her in Memphis Tennessee[Chorus]
Hey, the old man's back in town
He's spreading cheer around
He's come a long, long way
With his reindeer and his sleigh
He's bringing lots of toys
For all good girls and boys
So spread the news around
Yeah the old man's back in town
[Verse 1]
He's been waiting all year long
Just to bring his gifts to you
All the elves and Mrs. Claus
Have been waiting all year too
Now they're hooking up his reindeer
And they're loading down his sleigh
So take my advice you best be nice
Cause the old man's on his way
[Chorus]
Hey, the old man's back in town
He's spreading cheer around
He's come a long, long way
With his reindeer and his sleigh

For all good girls and boys
So spread the news around
Yeah the old man's back in town
[Verse 2]
Now the mistletoe is hung
And the tree is all a glow
The carolers have sung
Every Christmas song they know
And the kids are all in bed now
With Santa on their mind
So the scene is set and you an bet
He'll show up anytime
[Chorus]
Hey, the old man's back in town
He's spreading cheer around
He's come a long, long way
With his reindeer and his sleigh
He's bringing lots of toys
For all good girls and boys
So spread the news around
Yeah the old man's back in town
Everybody gather around
Cause the old man's back in townThat secondhand junkyard heap
Was freedom with two bucket seats
With two grand on the windshield in shoe polish
I had a stash of summer cash
From cleanin' pools and cuttin' grass
Gave the man that coffee can and I bought it
From the moment that I turned the key
My right foot was heavy
From a mile away folks could hear me
Leanin' on that Chevy
Slidin' sideways through the town square
Peelin' out, Bruce Springsteen turned up too loud
Playin' air guitar, drummin' on the dash
Only brakin' for the badge
Had the man in blue burnin' through
Tickets by the pound
Yeah, I paid for every red light
In my hometown
I still remember Jessie Lynn
Her sweet perfume and her poured in
Those faded jeans that always fit just right
Steamin' windows up on the riverbank
Had to get that V-8 cranked
To have her on the front porch by midnight
Catchin' air on railroad tracks
Detroit horses breathin'
Peelin' paint off of city hall
Fuzz buster screamin'
Slidin' sideways through the town square
Peelin' out Lynyrd Skynyrd turned up too loud
Playin' air guitar, drummin' on the dash
Only brakin' for the badge
Had the man in blue burnin' through
Tickets by the pound
Yeah, I paid for every red light
In my hometown
I burned up a hundred tires
Turnin' blacktop into gravel
Wore out my daddy's patience
And the judge's gavel
Slidin' sideways through the town square
Peelin' out, I can't drive 55 [Incomprehensible]
Playin' air guitar, drummin' on the dash
Only brakin' for the badge
Had the man in blue burnin' through
Tickets by the pound
Yeah, I paid for every red light
In my hometownDon't think that I'll be hangin' 'round while you're havin' fun
I won't sit there cryin' over you
Well from now on when you step out I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll lock the door, put out the cat and I'll go steppin' too
Yes I'll go steppin' too, my honey I'll go steppin' too
I'll lock the door, put out the cat and I'll go steppin' too
Now every time you come in late and we begin to fight
You tell me there are more fish in the sea
But the bait ain't what it used to be and I got news for you
Now after this when you go out well I'll go steppin' too
Yes I'll go steppin' too, my honey I'll go steppin' too
I'll lock the door, put out the cat and I'll go steppin' too
From now on when you come in and won't tell where you been
With your hair messed up and your clothes don't fit you right
Well I don't care if I find perfume on you too
Well you will know that I have been steppin' just like you
Yes I'll go steppin' too, my honey I'll go steppin' too
I'll lock the door, put out the cat and I'll go steppin' too
Yes I'll go steppin' too, my honey I'll go steppin' too
I'll lock the door, put out the cat and I'll go steppin' tooyou belong to my heart
now and forever
when our love had it's start
not long ago
we we're gathering stars
while a spanish guitar played our love songs
you belong to my heart and you'll always belong to meI thought you and me were something special
Thought you thought that way too
Now I know that this old boy just ain't the
Best you'll think you'll ever do
[Chorus]
It ain't cool to be crazy about you
It ain't suave or debonair
To let you know I care
Like I do
It ain't smart to be so reckless with my heart
(I) Should've known right from the start
I'd end up like a fool
Believe me it ain't cool
All of my friends they tried to tell me
What and what not to do
It took a while for them to sell me
But finally they got through
[Chorus]John Hardy was a desperate little man,
He carried two guns ev'ry day.
He shot down a man on that West Virginia line,
You oughta seen John Hardy gettin' away....
You oughta seen John Hardy gettin' away....
John Hardy stood in that old baroom,
So drunk that he could not see.
And a man walked up and took him by the arm,
He said, "Johnny, come and go along with me,
Poor boy, Johnny, come and walk along with me."
John Hardy stood in his old jail cell,
The tears running down from his eyes.
He said, "I've been the death of many a poor boy.
But my six-shooters never told a lie,
No, my six-shooters never told a lie.
The first one to visit John Hardy in his cell
Was a little girl dressed in blue.
She came down to that old jail cell,
She said, "Johnny, I've been true to you.
God knows, Johnny, I've been true to you."
The next one to visit John Hardy in his cell,
Was a little girl dressed in red.
She came down to that old jail cell,
She said, "Johnny, I had rather see you dead,
Well, Johnny, I had rather see you dead."
"I've been to the East and I've been to the West,
I've traveled this wide world around,
I've been to that river and I've been baptized,
So take me to my burying ground,
So take me to my burying ground."
John Hardy was a desperate little man,
He carried two guns ev'ry day.
He shot down a man on the West Virginia line,
You oughta seen John Hardy gettin' away,
You oughta seen John Hardy gettin' away.Darling you know it's true
The rumor you heard about me living you
Well I never told a soul
So tell me how the whole world knows
It must have been the roses and the wine
Or maybe this unexplainable smile
They say where there's smoke there's fire
Well I hope it's true
'Cause rumor has it you love me too
Well I've got a ring and a plan
But I see you already know what I'm gonna ask
I never said a thing
Tell me what gave it away
It must have been the roses and the wine
Or maybe this unexplainable smile
They say where there's smoke there's fire
Well I hope it's true
'Cause rumor has it you love me too
It must have been the roses and the wine
Or maybe this unexplainable smile
They say where there's smoke there's fire
Well I hope it's true
'Cause rumor has it you love me too
It must have been the roses and the wine
Or maybe this unexplainable smile
They say where there's smoke there's fire
Well I hope it's true
'Cause rumor has it you love me too
Yes you do
I heard it tooMy hillbilly baby the sweetest gal in town
You can bet I'll see her when the sun goes down
Someday I will marry her I hope I'm not too late
But until she's older oh I guess I'll have to wait
Well I know I'm mighty lucky a country boy like me
If I make her happy happy I will be
So until the wedding day I hope the time's not far away
I'll be waiting my hillbilly baby
[ guitar ]
Now I've heard song about the valleys and the mountain shacks
Songs about most every moon I know
But I'd rather sing the songs bout that gal of mine
She's the cutest little girl I know
My hillbilly baby...
I'll be waiting my hillbilly babyI've got my angel on my mind that's why I'm walkin'
There's such an ache in this old heart now I ain't talkin'
The little hand that held mine tight just waved goodbye tonight
I've got her sweet love on my mind that's why I'm walkin'
With an old love on your mind life's not worth livin'
I breathe her name with every breath I'm breathin'
Why could I never see how much she meant to me
I've got her sweet love on my mind that's why I'm walkin'
With an old love on your mind...
I've got my angel on my mind that's why I'm walkin'Stop that knocking on my front door
I know what you're up to now
Don't be coming 'round here no more
Flashing that smile around
I know what you're doing to me
I know that you're the heartbreak kind
Well honey you almost fooled me
But I wised up just in time
One step from a heartache
Two steps from the blues
So close to a teardrop
I know what you were gonna do
But I'm one step ahead of you
Don't be calling me on the phone
I'm hanging up if you do
I know you only been putting me on
But honey I'm on to you
I let down my defenses
When I saw those big brown eyes
But I came to my senses
Just in the nick of time
One step from a heartache
Two steps from the blues
So close to a teardrop
I know what you were gonna do
But I'm one step ahead of you
One step from a heartache
Two steps from the blues
So close to a teardrop
I know what you were gonna do
But I'm one step ahead of you
One step from a heartache
Two steps from the blues
So close to a teardrop
I know what you were gonna do
But I'm one step ahead of youI do alright, most of the time
I've learned to move on, I've learned to get by
But sometimes I can't find the reason to be free
So I leave a light on for your memory
I leave a light on for your memory
So it will be easy to come back to me
When it's late and I'm alone, I need some place to be
I leave a light on for your memory
You found a new love and I'd like to believe
That you're really better off without me
The good days have slipped away but I sometimes dream
So I leave a light on for your memory
I leave a light on for your memory
So it will be easy to come back to me
When it's late and I'm alone, I need some place to be
I leave a light on for your memory
Yeah, when it's late and I'm alone, I need some place to be
I leave a light on for your memoryhe said drink deeply of the wine, my friend, breathe fully in the smoke
and eat the fish that he conjured, this is the bread that jesus broke
this is grape juice and cheap vodka, man, this isn't even wine
i'm smokin shredded cardboard, eating sawdust baked with lime
this is not the truth you tell me, but some terrible, evil joke
sounds to me like the counterfeit blues have got you by the throat
there seem to me an awful lot of charltans round here
and hustlers, cheats and anglers, fixers, sharps and mutineers
the factory and subterfuge and corporato cheat
conspire to fast reduce us to the stamping of our feet
the lords of mass producto mass product at quite a pace
it won't be long these counterfeit blues'll run the whole damn place
these notes that you've been paying with are a little bit too green
the printing's off, the ink has got a polyester sheen
your bill has grown too large and now you'll have to work it off
and your snout will have to make its way from the far end of the trough
you got suckered into tryin to make your make your money overnight
looks to me like the counterfeit blues will be doggin you all of your life
the worn out western hat i got no longer smells like horse
and i can't afford to keep one around now that rooster's gone, of course
i guess i've left it all behind me now except for when i write
and sing ancestral praises of the ones who knew that life
yes, years of rocka rolla have extracted quite a fee
maybe them old counterfeit blues have been creepin up on me[ Wayne Wilson ]
When you're holdin' me make sure that I'm the one to hold
Don't tell me that you love me it leaves me the cold
And please don't lie to me you know how that hurt
Don't wipe the tears that you cry for him on my good white shirt
When you're kissin' me make sure that I'm the one you wanna kiss
Don't tell me that you miss me when it's him you really miss
And please me and think of him nothing could be worse
Don't wipe the tears that you cry for him on my good white shirt
Well I dress my very best when I go out with of you
But I'd hate to think that I was just too well dressed blue
Don't love me for a little while what would that be worth
Don't wipe the tears that you cry for him on my good white shirt
[ guitar ]
Well I dress my very best...
Don't wipe the tears that you cry for him on my good white shirtDADDY WAS AN OLD TIME PREACHER MAN
(Dolly Parton - Dorothy Jo Hope)
Daddy was an old time preacher man
He preached the word of God throughout the land
He praeached so plain a child could understand
Yes daddy was an old time preacher man
He told the people of the need to pray
He talked about God's wrath on Judgement Day
He preached about that great eternity
He breathed hell so hot that you could feel the heat
Daddy was an old time preacher man and Leona would get up to testify
As we'd sing in the sweet by and by then we'd sing I'm on my way to Canaan's
Land
Yes daddy was an old time preacher man
Revivals and camps meeting's with four weeks
Folks came from all around to hear him preach
Daddy said if one is saved it's worth it all
But the aisles were all we stilled in altar call
Daddy was an old time preacher man...
Daddy worked for God but asked no pay for he believed that God provides away
We never had a lot but we got by
I guess it's cause the Lord was on my daddy's side
Yes daddy was an old time preacher man
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore
I'm on my way to Canaan's Land yes daddy was an old time preacher man
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore
I'm on my way to Canaan's Land yes daddy was an old time preacher manDolly Parton
Get To Livin
Verse 1:
People always coming up to me,
And asking Dolly whats your secret?
With all you do your attitude just seems
To be so good how do you keep it?
Well am not the Dalai Lama but ill try,
To Offer up a few word of advice.
Chorus:
Youd better get to living, Givin

And lovin on the way.

A little bit more concerned about where youre going
Just a word unto the wise.
Youd better get to livin.
Verse 2:
A girlfriend came to my house,

And you better get to livin.Well, I have lived a lot and done my part of running 'round
And never did I think I'd let a sweet love get me down
But now I see how wrong I was, you're part of every plan
Perhaps I'll pay but come what may, my heart's at your command
Oh, this aching, breaking heart of mine is crazy over you
And I'm afraid to let you know I love you like I do
For if you knew how much I care, I know what you would do
You'd drop me like the others and go find somebody new
Last night I saw you, darling, in the arms of someone new
And I know that you don't love him, you just want to make me blue
I guess you think that hurting me will make me love you more
But someday from you, darling, this old heart will lock its door
Oh, this aching, breaking heart of mine is crazy over you
And I'm afraid to let you know I love you like I do
For if you knew how much I care, I know what you would do
You'd drop me like the others and go find somebody newAs I lay here by my woman I know I'm back where I belong again
I can't help but think about you though and all the things that might've been
But we used commonsense to work it out we quit before the word got out
We hurt each other stead of hurtin' all the rest
But why'd the last time have to be the best
Why'd the last time have to be the time the time we made our poem rhyme
You were perfect no more no less Lord why'd the last time have to be the best
Today I passed our old meetin' place
You know it's not hittin' like we used to think it was
I guess we were just blinded by passion runnin' with the burnin' love
But we used commonsense...
I guess I'll always wonder why the last time had to be the bestNow I like candy and I like cake and I like jam but goodness sake
There's nothing as sweet as my baby
She got golden hair and big blue eyes she could win a beauty prize
There's nothing as sweet as my baby
If I ever lose her I'll lay me down and die
If sugar seems sweet then you oughta meet my honey coated sweetie pie
I like candy and I like cake and I like jam but goodness sake
There's nothing as sweet as my baby
[ guitar - steel ]
Now I like candy and I like cake and I like jam but goodness sake
There's nothing as sweet as my baby
I'll be like a honeybee when she's buzzin' round with me
There's nothing as sweet as my baby
Got pounds of candy kisses but I can't spare an ounce
She's sweeter than wine and brother she's mine
And that's the only thing that counts
I like candy and I like cake and I like jam but goodness sake
There's nothing as sweet as my babyThere's a little girl out lying on her own
She's got a broken heart
She's not the kind to take you down for long
She knows and plays it smart
And if she's coming, she's shown no more
She's heard no whistle blowing from the door
She feels like leaving and don't know why
Without no bridges she's trapped, so i sigh
Don't cross the river if you can't swim the tide
Don't try denying lying on the other side
All your life you were on your own
If you want you can ride my train
Soon forget the reason that you're leaving
Lose yourself and then sometimes
Maybe even save yourself some grieving
Don't cross the river if you can't swim the tide
Don't try denying lying on the other side
All your life you were on your own
If you want you can ride my train
Soon forget the reason that you're leaving
Lose yourself and then sometimes
Maybe even save yourself some grieving
Don't cross the river if you can't swim the tide
Don't try denying lying on the other side
All your life you were on your ownif only i had paid attention
to what you needed from me
i would have seen what you were missing
in the man i promised you i'd be
and if only i had listened
to what your heart was trying to say
then i wouldn't be here wishing
for the love that i let slip away
chorus 1
and everyday that goes by no matter how hard i try
i can't change the past and i can't bring you back
and all the things i didn't do and the pain i put you thru
i crossed that line and it was more than love allowed
if only i'd known then what i know now
if only i could make a happy ending
wave a magic wand and touch your heart
but what's the use in me pretending
when i don't even know where you are
chorus 2
and everyday that goes by no matter how hard i try
i can't change the past, no i can't bring you back
so it's time i let you go, take my regrets on down the road
learn to face the truth that i couldn't face before
if only doesn't matter anymore
tag
when it comes to me and you
if only doesn't matter anymoreIf you were the woman and I was the man
Would I send you yellow roses
Would I dare to kiss your hand?
In the morning would I caress you
As the wind caresses the sand,
If you were the woman and I was the man?
If I was the heart and you were the head
Would you think me very foolish
If one day I decided to shed
These walls that surround me
Just to see where these feelings led,
If I was the heart and you were the head?
If I was the woman and you were the man
Would I laugh if you came to me
With your heart in your hand
And said, 'I offer you this freely
And will give you all that I can
Because you are the woman
And I am the man?'We're packin' up our clothes and we're goin'
We're headin' out to some place where it's snowin'
Cause for you and for me and the kids there's gonna be
A good old fashion country Christmas
Some folks enjoy Christmas in the city
To them downtown shopping seems all pretty
But for you and for me and the kids there's gonna be
A good old fashion country Christmas
Well we'll chop some fire wood and pop some popcorn for the Christmas tree
We'll hang our stockings on the meadow there for ol' Saint Nick to see
And when our happy holydays have ended we'll head back to the city quite contented
With our hearts full of peace and with happy memories
Of a good old fashion country Christmas
[ steel ]
Well we'll chop some fire wood...
I love the good old fashion country ChristmasShe married the one I love today
When my back was turned she took him away
Now while they're all outside, waiting to throw rice
What I want to throw will surely black her eyes
Cause I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
She took the only love I had
No, I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
It would be a way to hurt her 'cause she hurt me so bad
Well I never stole nothin' in my life
But if I get the chance I'll steal him from his wife
Cause all is fair in love and war, maybe I'm carryin' this too far
But I feel like tying dynamite to her side of the car
No I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
She took the only love I had
No, I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
It would be a way to hurt her 'cause she hurt me so badWhen Joseph was an old man, an old man was he
He married Virgin Mary, the Queen of Galilee
He married Virgin Mary, the Queen of Galilee
Mary and Joseph walk through an orchid green
There were berries and cherries as thick as might be seen
There were berries and cherries as thick as might be seen
And Mary said to Joseph, so meek and so mild
"Joseph, gather me some cherries for I am with child"
"Joseph, gather me some cherries for I am with child"
And Joe flew in anger, in anger flew he
Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee
Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee
Then up spoke Baby Jesus from in Mary's womb
"Bend down the tallest tree that my mother might have some"
"Bend down the tallest tree that my mother might have some"
And bent down tallest branch till it touched Mary's hand
Cried she, "Oh look, thou Joseph, I have cherries by command"
Cried she, "Oh look, thou Joseph, I have cherries by command"The nights were dark and long, I spent a million all alone
But I never once stopped loving you
My world was cold and still, my dreams lay unfulfill
Oh, but I never once stopped loving you
I'll never once stop believing
We'd love again the way we used to do
And today when you came back
My patience was rewarded
Cause I never once stopped loving you
I could have loved another but I chose to wait and suffer
For I never once stopped loving you
I prayed to God to guide you until I could be beside you
No, I never once stopped loving you
I'll never once stop believing
We'd love again the way we used to do
And today when you came back
My patience was rewarded
Cause I never once stopped loving youOh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Oh it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
When we finally kiss good night
How I hate going out in this storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
When we finally kiss good night
How I hate going out in this storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow let it snow let it snowA heart may be fickle and words may deceive
But when you love someone you try to believe
The love is a true as the stars in the sky
Believe what you want to but kisses don't lie
A true lover?s kisses are moments of bliss
And when they kiss someone they're heart?s in each kiss
But each time you kiss me I know that you try
To prove that you love me but kisses don't lie
Last night when I kissed you and held you so tight
Your lips you surrender but things were not right
You words may deceive my your sweet lips may try
To show that you love me but kisses don't lie
I know you are changing that I'm losing you
You tell me I'm wrong that your heart is still true
You may never leave me but dear I know why
You don't want to hurt me but kisses don't lieWhen I'm low in spirit I cry Lord lift me up I want to go higher with Thee
But nothing grows high on a mountain so He picked out a valley for me
And He leads me beside still waters somewhere in the valley below
And He draws me aside to be tested and tried in the valley He restoreth my soul
It's dark as a dungeon and the sun seldom shines
And I question Lord why must this be
Then He tells me there's strenght in my sorrow and there's victory in trials for me
Then He leads me beside still waters
Down in the valley He restoreth my soulThe courtroom was crowded the judge waited there
My mother was crying when I left my chair
The sentence were sharp for it cut like a knife
For ninety ninety years folks is almost for life
I dreamed of the whistle I heard the bells ring
My sweetheart was coming some good news to bring
I knew that she loved me and that she'd be true
She said she would save me I'm guilty as you
She went for a pardon or else for parole
I know she'll come back for she's part of my soul
If she ever fails me I'd be mighty blue I'll stay in this jailhouse I'll die in here too
[ dobro ]
They said I was a criminal and to my despair
They sent me to Nashville and shaved off my hair
So come hear my story I'll tell you my fate
I'm serving in Nashville for another man's hate
I just got a letter from Nashville town and after I read it my spirit broke down
It's sad that my sweetheart and the judge would be wed
And here in this jailhouse I wish I was dead
No matter how right folks a man he may be
Bad company will sent him to prison like me
So take a good woman and make her your wife
For ninety ninety years folks is almost for lifeJealous heart oh jealous heart stop beating can't you see the damage you have done
You have driven him away forever jealous heart now I'm the lonely one
I was part of everything he planned for and I know he loved me from the start
Now he hates the sight of all I stand for since he heard your beating jealous heart
I was part of everything(Mike Ward / Dierks Bentley)
Like the leaves I get restless
I just can't seem to settle down
When the autumn wind blows, it cuts right to my soul
And pulls my roots out of the ground
Chorus
Lonesome why do you love me you won't leave me
Why can't we ever be apart
Just when love finds me your chains they bind me
Forever shackled to your heart
Lonesome why do you love me
Rain ain't fallin on my windshield
But there's tears in my rearview
Nature's dyin I know behind she's cryin
Why do we leave them sad and blue
Chorus
You won't leave me
Chorus
Why do you love me
You won't let me be won't set me free
Lonesome why do you love meEVERY WORD I WRITE
WRITERS GEORGE RICHEY, ROGER BOWLING, JAN CRUTCHFIELD
I've been sitting here alone all night
Thinking 'bout things that I'm gonna write
When you read this goodbye note you'll know I've had enough
But it should come at no surprise to you
Knowing you treat me the way you do
You've made lovin' too hard and living too rough
I just need a good place to start
To say what I really feel in my heart
And what I'm gonna write to you is long overdue
And don't expect me to change my mind
Or try to read something between the lines
Make no mistake about it baby, we're through
But every word I write comes out I love you
I just want to say it's over no matter how I try
Every word I write comes out I love you
Guess I've loved you much too long to say goodbyeOn your knees you are taller than trees
You can look over heartaches and fears
When my faith is gone to my knees
I will go growing stronger and taller than trees
One night it was a long time ago
Now I knelt at my mother's knee
For I weary, I was heartsick, I was blue
She said, son lift up your eyes to Him
To Him up in the skies
And you'll grow, oh yes, son
You'll grow tall and strong
Like the mighty oaks
And this was the answer I felt
As down at her knees I knelt
Down on your knees
You can go taller than treesMy pappy said son you gonna drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln
Have you heard the story about the hot rod race
When the Ford and the Lincoln were settin' the pace
That story's true I'm here to say
Cause I was a drivin' that Model A
It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up
That Model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got eight cylinders and uses them all
And an overdrive that just won't stall
It's got a 4-barrel carb and dual exhausts
4:11 gears that really get lost
Safety tubes and I'm not scared
The brakes are good and the tires are fair
We left San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars were shinin' bright
We were drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passin' cars like they were standin' still
Then all of a sudden, in the wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
I said boys that's the mark for me
But by then the taillights was all you could see
Now the fellers ribbed me for bein' behind
So I started to make that Lincoln unwind
Took my foot off the gas and man alive
I shoved it down into overdrive
Well I wound it up to hundred and ten
Twisted the speedometer cable hit top end
Had my foot glued right to the floor
I said that's all there is there ain't no more
Now the fellas thought I'd lost all sense
The telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said slow down I see spots
The lines on the road just looked like dots
I took a corner and passed a truck
I crossed my fingers just for luck
The fenders clickin' the guard rail post
The guy beside me was white as a ghost
Smoke was comin' outta the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
I knew I could catch him and hoped I could pass
But when I did I'd be short on gas
Had flames comin' from out of the side
You could feel the tension man what a ride
I said look out boys I've got a license to fly
And the Cadillac pulled over and let me by
Now all of a sudden a rod started knockin'
Down in the depths she started a rockin'
I looked in the mirror and a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln
They arrested me and put me in jail.
They called my pop to throw my bail.
And he said son you're gonna drive me to drinkin'
If you don't quit drivin' that Hot Rod LincolnWhen I was but a youngster Christmas meant one thing
That I'd be getting lots of toys that day
I learned a whole lot different when mother set me down
And taught me to spell Christmas this way
C is for the Christ Child born upon this day
H is for Herald Angels in the night
R means our redeemer I means Israel
S is for the star that shone so bright
T is for three wise men they who travelled far
M is for the manger where he lay
A's for all he stands for S means shepherds came
And that's why there's a Christmas Day
And that's why there's a Christmas DayThe one I love found another she ran away with my best friend
Came home last night for just an hour daylight came she's gone again
Well you can have her I don't want her she never loved me anyway
She only wanted someone to play with but all I wanted was love to stay
Well if you get the wrong woman there's only one thing you can do
Just dig a hole crawl right in it and pull the ground in after you
Well you can have her
Life without love is mighty empty when you've got no one that you can hold
I'd rather have love I can cling to than have the world and all of its gold
Well you can have her,
Well you can have her(C.W. McCall, Bill Fries, Chip Davis)
One green April mornin', when I was a young boy
I lay by the window, a-watchin' the rain
And I wondered if ever the sun would come shinin'
So I could go somewhere to play
Then down from the sky flew a little brown sparrow
And he lit on the branch of an old willow tree
And he sit there, watchin', as I lay wond'rin'
Just the little brown sparrow and me
On a green April mornin', when I was a young boy
And little brown sparrows were free
Then he looked in my window and he spied his reflection
There was the willow, there was the sky
And he wondered if ever the sun would come shinin'
And which was the way for the sparrow to fly
Well, he spread out his wings and he flew to the window
Fast as the wind, sure as could be
But the sky in the window was only a wishin'
For the little brown sparrow and me
On a green April mornin', when I was a young boy
And little brown sparrows were free
So there by the window, the sparrow had fallen
He died on the ground in the cold April rain
And I wondered if ever the sun would come shinin'
And someone could only explain
Then I laid there and saw the wind blow through the willow
And cover him over with yesterday's leaves
And there in the rain, I cried for a sparrow
For a little brown sparrow and me
On a green April mornin', when I was a young boy
And little brown sparrows were free
On a green April mornin', when life was a window
For a little brown sparrow and meI just got your letter dearest sweetheart
And darlin', I miss you oh, so much
Your letter has cheered me, but I'm lonesome
Lonesome just to feel your lovin' touch
(Chorus)
Letters have no arms, dear to hold me
Kisses on paper are so cold
These sweet things you write in your letter
I want to be with you dear, when told
Letters never bring me the touch of your hand
Or none of your sweet lovin' charms
I get so lonesome for you, darlin'
And you know that letters have no arms
[Chorus:]Wear away wear away I'm so afraid that time may wear away your love someday
If water can wear away the hardest rock if --- can wear away the strongest lock
Then I can't help but wonder could it ever be
That time could wear away your love from me
Wear away wear away I'm so afraid that time may wear away your love someday
Now our love is as solid as the hardest rock
And our hearts bound together with the strongest lock
And still I can't help but wonder could it ever be
That time could wear away your love from me
Wear away wear away I'm so afraid that time may wear away your love somedayI love you so much, it hurts me
Darling, that's why I'm so blue
I'm so afraid to go to bed at night
Afraid of losing you
I love you so much, it hurts me
And there's nothing I can do
I want to hold you, my Dear, forever and ever
I love so much, it hurts me so
I love you so much, it hurts me
Darling, that's why I'm so blue
I'm so afraid to go to bed at night
Afraid of losing you
I love you so much, it hurts me
And there's nothing I can do
I want to hold you, my Dear, forever and ever
I love so much it hurts me soCause I told 'em about that little boy of mine
And how his first word about that old truck was Giddy up go
Well today I was barrelin' down old 66
When up beside me pulled down a brand new diesel rig
Both stacks of blowin' black coal
And as she pulled around and back in front of me
A big ole lump came in my throat
And my eyes watered like I had a bad old cough
A little sign on the back of the truck that read Giddy up go
Well I pushed old Giddy up go stayed right on him
Until the next truck stop where he'd pulled up
I waited till he went in and I offered to buy him a cup
Well we got to talkin' shop and I said
Now did you come by the name on your truck Giddyup go
Well he said I got it from my pop
Dad used to drive a truck that's what mom talked about a lot
You see I lost mom when I was just past sixteen
And I lost all track of pop cause mom said he got the name from me
I shook his hand and told him that I had something I wanted him to see
I took him out to the old truck
And brushed off some of the dirt so the name would show
And his eyes got big and bright as he read Giddyup go
Oh we had a lot of things to talk about and buddy I felt like a king
And now we've just pulled back on the old 66I'LL STRING ALONG WITH YOU
Writers Al Dubin, Harry Warren
You may not be an angel 'Cause angels are so few But until the day that one comes along I'll string along with you I'm looking for an angel To sing my love song to And until the day that one comes along I'll string along with you For every little fault that you have Say I have three or four The human little fault that you do have Just make me love you more You may not be angel But still I'm sure you'll do So until that day that one comes along I'll string along with you For every little fault that you have Say I have three or four The human little fault that you do have Just make me love you more You may not be angel But still I'm sure you'll do So until that day that one comes along I'll string along with you.I was up in New York City,
Just the other week.
You shoulda seen the waitress face
When I ordered sweet tea.
She said "we don't have that here"
And I apologized, I said "Please forgive me,
I'm in a southern state of mind."
And those girls out in California,
They don't understand.
They don't like it when I hold the door,
When I say yes ma'am.
They act like I've done something wrong,
And they give me the evil eye.
I say "honey, I'm sorry,
I'm in a southern state of mind."
I could be anywhere
In my heart I'm always there.
Where they drink sweet tea
And they raise you to be polite.
No changin' who I am,
That's they way I've always been.
No matter what state I'm in,
I'm in a southern state of mind.
I'm always walkin' 'round
Tellin' everybody hi.
Justa wavin' at the strangers
And the cars passin' by.
Some people may look at me
And say that boy just ain't right.
Hey y'all I ain't crazy,
I'm in a southern state of mind.
I could be anywhere
In my heart I'm always there.
Where you know every body and if you don't your still polite.
No changin' who I am, that's they way I've always been.
No matter what state I'm in,
I'm in a southern state of mind.
You can see it in the clothes I wear,
You can hear it when I talk.
Ball cap boots and jeans and a little southern draw.
I can be up in Ohio or back home in Caroline.
No matter what state I'm in,
I'm in a southern state of mind.
Don't matter what state I'm in,
I'm in a southern state of mind.
Yeah, alright.
Southern state of mind.
Come on, come on.
Oh oh.She's a rapid fire coming down a one way target range
She's a first shot, creeping up, hit you just a right way
Take your love, lay it down, shoot a smile as you start to fall
She's a money down, lose it all, hit you like a wrecking ball
She's gone, yeah she's gone
That girl, she's gone, yeah she's gone
She's a walk through the wet woods, wreckage from the house she burned
She's a smoke still rising from the ashes from a lesson learned
She's a black leather seat in the summer of muscle car
She's a fire red lipstick ready to leave her mark
And she's gone, yeah she's gone
She's gone, yeah she's gone
Oh
I guess I should have known it
I should have seen this coming
So I put the blame on me right now
She's gone, yeah she's gone
That girl, she's gone, yeah she's gone
Oh oh oh
She's a rapid fire coming down a one way target range
She's a first shot creeping up hit you just a right wayJust hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling yoo-hoo
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggling close together
Like two birds of a feather should be
Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
There's a birthday party
At the house of farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending
To the perfect day
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing
Without a single stop
At the fireplace where
We'll watch the chestnuts pop
There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee
And the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print
By Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our livesThis is my story this is my song praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story this is my song praising my Savior all the day long
Blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of glory divine
Air of salvation purchase of God born of His spirit washed in His blood
This is my story
Perfect submission all is the rest I in my Savior am happy and blessed
Watching and waiting looking above filled with His goodness lost in His love
This is my storyIn the time it takes to tell you
I could show you
In the time it takes to wonder
You could know
Everything inside my heart
Waiting for this dance to start
All you gotta do
All you gotta do is let go...
In the time it takes to want me
You can have me
And you'd never have to ask how much I care
Love for me is not some game
Any time you call my name
I'll be there
Like a star that's traveled years to shine
Like a song that wants to hear the rhyme
In the time it takes
In the time it takes
Like a spark that makes your soul ignite
Only love knows when the moments right
In the time it takes
In the time it takes
Nothing I wouldn't give
Knowing I couldn't live without you
And if I get my wish
Heavens gonna help me
Heavens gonna make you mine
(Repeat Chorus)I'm gonna keep on living
Even though I sometimes do
Fantasize about disappearing
Down in the ocean blue
Just to get some peace and quiet
From the warfare inside my heart
Well I've been under ear-splitting fire
Ever since we've been apart
Well I'm gonna wash the dishes
Pay the bills and watch the news
I've got the tough education
No celebration
Divorce separation blues
Yodel eh hee yodelo lodi lay he yodel lay he
Well I'm gonna keep on waking
And rising up before the sun
And lying in the dark wide awake
When everybody else is done
And sleeping in their beds so peaceful
Dreaming with the love they choose
I've got the tough education
No celebration
Divorce separation blues
Yodel eh hee yodelo lodi lay he yodel lay he
And I'll sign on
The line beneath my name
The road is gone
I can't go back the way we came
Well neither one of us
Really wanna hear the town
We try to keep our friends at bay
Try to keep the gossip down
Well some folks just want the dirt
And don't even care if it's true
But then again who cares who's talking
I'm worried for myself and you
And I'll sign on
The line beneath my name
The road is gone
I can't go back the way we came
They say one of every two
Bound to be set aflame
Every level of resentment
Responsibility and blame
Well now I'm bound to break a promise
One I made to God and you
I've got the tough education
No celebration
Divorce separation blues
I've got the tough education
No celebration
Bad communication
Worse interpretation
Love deprivation
Pain allocation
Soul devastation
Cold desolation
Life complication
Resuscitation
Divorce separation blues
Yodel eh hee, olay hee, olay hee, olay hee
Yodel eh hee yodelo lodi lay he yodel lay he[Chorus]
Round, round, I wanna go round
Wanna see the rock of ages
When my body gives out
Gonna read the final pages
Oh, my mother who's gone
She told me I should meet her
Someday streets of gold
Gonna guide me on to greet her
Once my father sat down
And told me of the prophets
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
They're gone but not forgotten
Round, round, I wanna go round
Wanna see the rock of ages
Til my body gives out
Gonna read the gospel pages
Moses heard a voice
It called him up the mountain
Forty days had set
When Moses come a shoutin'
[Chorus: x3]Little man watch your woman just a little too close
Little man keep a woman tie down
And a woman's gonna wonder what it is she's a missin'
And a woman's gonna want to look around
Love's gotta have a little breathing room
A woman's gonna have a little say
Love's gotta have a little breathing room
Else a woman's gonna want to break away
[ guitar ]
The only way I know holding on to a woman
Is to give her all the loving she can stand
And the best way to make her to be a do right mama
Is to try to be a do right man
Love's gotta have a little breathing room...
[ guitar ]
So if you got you a woman and she's doing you right
Then be satisfied and let it goin' fat
Cause when you start out a lookin' where there's something better cookin'
You might find your woman where it's at
Love's gotta have a little breathing room...Think of your fellow man, lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see, it's getting late, oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see
Another day goes by, and still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know, we won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see. Wait and seeYou'd known so long that you were wrong
But still you have your way
You told her lies and alibis
And hurt her more each day
But now your conscience bothers you
You've reached your journey's end
You're asking me for sympathy
I'm sorry for you, my friend
You laughed inside each time she cried
You tried to make her blue
She tugged along through right or wrong
Because she worshiped you
You know that you're the one to blame
There's no use to pretend
Today's the day you start to pay
I'm sorry for you, my friend
Today as she walked arm in arm
At someone else's side
It made you stop and realize
That time has turned to tide
You should've known you'd be alone
'Cause cheaters never win
You tried and lost, now pay the cost
I'm sorry for you, my friendThere is something in your heart weighing heavy on my mind
You need gentle arms to hold you like these gentle arms of mine
You need love and understanding and a shoulder you can cry on
You need someone to rely on you don't have to be alone
Let me help you work it out help you face the situation
May I offer consolation let me help you work it out
Let me help you work it out I'm the one who'll always care
When you need me I'll be there let me help you work it out
Let me help you work it outSometimes I think of Mrs. T.
She was always such a sweet lady.
I went down, down to Montreal
To chase her younger days,
A half-smoked cigarette and a broken phrase,
I went down, down to Saint-Laurent.
Et cest l que jai vu
Le ciel et la terre prs du moi.
Et cest l que jai vu.
Tout au mme temps.
Sometimes I think about Rita.
Shell hunt down words just to feed ya.
I wrote it down and wrote out again.
Now she lives across the pond,
Learning to eat with a foreign tongue.
I wrote it down
And it became a song.
Et c'est la que j'ai vu
Le ciel et la terre pres du moi.
Et c'est la que j'ai vu.
Tout au meme temps.
Et c'est la que j'ai vu
Le ciel et la terre pres du moi.
Et c'est la que j'ai vu.
Tout au meme temps.
Now I think about David
And what he was like as a little kid.
I walked down and introduced myself.
He mustve shaken lots of hands,
Learned the language of many a man.
I walked down and made him my friend.
Et c'est la que j'ai vu
Le ciel et la terre pres du moi.
Et c'est la que j'ai vu.
Tout au meme temps.
Et c'est la que j'ai vu
Le ciel et la terre pres du moi.
Et c'est la que j'ai vu.
Tout au meme temps.
[Chorus of Ohs]Bartender, I know you're a reasonable man
Looks like you got the run of this place
Set me up a round so's that I can see your hands
And wipe the goddamned smile off of your face
I'm sure you must have heard of me, I'm lightning with my Smith
And my reputation burns all through the west
So if you know what is good for you, shut up and get the whiskey
And not that trade stuff, I want nothin' but your best
And pour 'em kinda strong 'cause I won't be here long
You best not do me wrong, just pour 'em kinda strong
I ain't got time to savour 'em, I gotta drink 'em quick
I've conveyed my urgency, I hope
If they catch me it's all over, I'll be way on up the creek
And I'll be swingin' on the wrong end of a rope
The posse's been behind me now for six or seven days
Only two hours back and chewin' on my dust
I got a powerful thirst I come in here to try to slake
So serve it up or draw down if you must
Well I wasn't really watchin' you, my eyes was on the door
Imagine my surprise to hear the cock
Of that .32 that left me here to bleed out on your floor
I'm too far gone to bother with the doc
Well I wasn't really watchin' you, my eyes was to the east
You know, to dull the pain I could use one more
You surely won't deny a man a dyin' drink at least
I'm awful embarrassed at how I spoke to you before
So pour 'em kinda strong 'cause I won't be here long
Mister, please don't do me wrong, just pour 'em kinda strong
You surely won't deny a dyin' man a drink at least
I'm awful embarrassed at how I spoke to you beforeThey talk way too much
Spend music way to little
And what they usually play ain't really all that great
What's up DJ?
Seems all you play each and everyday
When I turn it on
It's the same old song
Nobody wants to hear
Well I'm a product of the Bocefus generation
Now what they call country
Really gets me aggravated
Well it's a fact
To many acts with a big contract
Can't sing a note
That song they wrote
Ain't music to my ears
I miss old Johnny Cash
When I'm in the car these days
'Cause when I turn on the radio
It makes me, make me wanna say
Hell no
Turn it off
Come on
Hell no
Sounds bad
Who sings that song?
Back to back
They play it all day long
Bring back the days of Conway Twitty
When singers were good
And songs were country
He's got a '64 plush lime green Impala
He's got a big pimp daddy attitude
He's got a gold tooth grill
And some spinning wheels
That he had to steal
It's the boomiest
It's the bassiest
And those baggy pants are weird
He's a product of the Snoop Dog generation
I've never seen a white boy
You've so much activate him
Well my ears are shot
'Cause I bet he's got a hundred thousand watts
And a dozen amps
'Cause it breaks my lamps
Each time he drives by here
I shout out from the house
Keep it down I'm tryin' to sleep
Then he pops in Dr. Dre
As he flips a bird at me
Hell no
Turn it off
Come on
Hell no
Sounds bad
Who the heck sings that song?
The kid next door
He plays it all night long
Feels just like I'm livin' in rap city
It's way to loud for this here hillbilly
Yeah, yeah
Am I tired of doin' these parodies
Of Toby, Kenny, Montgomery, Gentry?
Hell, hell, hell no
Hell no
Turn it off
Come on
Hell no
Sounds bad
Who sings that song?
Back to back
They play it all day long
Somethin's wrong here in Music city
Everything it sounds so shh
Hell no
Turn it off
Come on
Hell no
Sounds bad
Who the heck sings that song?
Back to back
They play it all day long
Bring back the days of Conway Twitty
When singers were good
And songs were country
You got that rightA letter from home came this morning
And each line on that handwritten page
Drew a picture of life in Louisiana
And just how long that I've been away
Dear daughter, we love you and miss you
So I thought I would drop you a line
Just to tell you how we long to see you
And to say that we're doing just fine
I don't know all the people who've told me
That they've stayed up way past their bedtime
Just to see you, sing and play in California
On the TV last Saturday night
Your Dad heard your song in New Orleans
And he told me that he felt so proud
That he pulled alongside of the highway
And he turned up that radio loud
Are you taking good care of yourself, dear
Are those city folks treating you well
If you need anything you can call us
We love you more than just words could ever tell
I remember when you were just a baby
The best years that we've ever had
Until they're gone we'll forever remember
Love always, your Momma and Dad
Love always, your Momma and DadO God of loveliness, O Lord of Heaven above
How worthy to possess my heart's devoted love
So sweet thy countenance, so gracious to behold
That one, one only glance to me were bliss untold
To think thou art my God, o thought forever blest
My heart has overflowed this joy within my breast
My soul so full of bliss, plunged in a rolling sea
Deep in the sweet abyss of holy charity
O loveliness supreme and beauty shining bright
O ever flowing stream and ocean of delight
This faith by which I live, my truest life above
To thee alone I give my undivided love
AmenI'm like a cloud drifting from town to town each new love just helps me on my way
No one woman's ever gonna tie me down
When one gets too close I'll just back up and say
I gotta be walkin' on new grass singin' a new song
Tomorrow there's no telling where I'll be
But I'll be walking on new grass singing a new song
The next time up the road keeps calling me
I'm warning you don't fall in love with me I don't plan on being here too long
You're just a leaf caught in a playfull breeze I'll carry you a while then I'll move on
I gotta be walkin' on new grass...
[ guitar ]
I won't take roots I never stay that long and a bad seed just won't grow anyway
This rolling stone don't wanna gather no moss
When the grass starts to grow I'll back up and say
Well I gotta be walkin' on new grass...Farewell fair ladies I'm leaving Cheyenne
Farewell fair ladies I'm leaving Cheyenne
Goodbye my little darling, my pony won't stand
Old Paint, Old Paint, I'm leaving Cheyenne
Goodbye Old Paint I'm leaving Cheyenne
Old Paint's a good pony, and she paces when she can
In the middle of the ocean there grows a green tree
But it [] falls to the girl that loves me
Old Paint, Old Paint, I'm leaving Cheyenne
Goodbye Old Paint I'm leaving Cheyenne
Old Paint's a good pony, and she paces when she can
We lay down on the blankets of the green grassy ground
And the horses and the cattle were grazing all around
Old Paint, Old Paint, I'm leaving Cheyenne
Goodbye Old Paint I'm leaving Cheyenne
Old Paint's a good pony, and she paces when she can
Oh, the last time I saw her she was grazing in the fall
She was riding Old Paint and leading []
Old Paint, Old Paint, I'm leaving Cheyenne
Goodbye Old Paint I'm leaving Cheyenne
Old Paint's a good pony, and she paces when she can
My feets in my stirrups, my bridle's in my hand
Goodbye my little pony no longer to stand
Old Paint, Old Paint, I'm leaving Cheyenne
Goodbye Old Paint I'm leaving Cheyenne
Old Paint's a good pony, and she paces when she can
Farewell fair ladies I'm leaving Cheyenne
Farewell fair ladies I'm leaving Cheyenne
Goodbye my little darling, my pony won't standSHADOWS OF HER MIND
(Kris Kristofferson)
'68 Careers BMG Music
I met her sadly in the slowly falling rain
Crying softly in her loveliness and pain
Knowing no one needin' someone bad as me
And she told me as I held her trembling hand
Walking slowly how she'd never known a man
Living lonely in her cottage by the sea
When the morning came her tears had changed to laughter
And before the night her heart beat close to mine
And I thought as she lay sleeping bout the secrets she was keeping
Hidden somewhere in the silence of the shadows of her mind
In the morning as I wakened with the dawn
Without warning I could feel that she was gone
Leaving nothing but her silence next to me
And lonely footprints that I followed in the sand
Walking slowly for I knew where they would end
Disappearing in the silence of the sea
And I sometimes hear the echo of her laughter
As I search for what I know I'll never find
For the answer I was seeking was the secrets she's still keeping
Hidden somewhere in the silence of the shadows of her mind
Hidden somewhere in the silence of the shadows of her mindCity sidewalks, busy sidewalks.
Dressed in holiday style
In the air
There's a feeling
Of Christmas
Children laughing
People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush
Home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle
You'll hearLove writes a letter and sends it to Hate:
"My vacation's ending, I'm coming home late
The weather was fine and the ocean was great
And I can't wait to see you again."
Hate reads the letter and throws it away
"No one here cares if you go or you stay
I barely even noticed that you were away
I'll see you or I won't, whatever."
Love sings a song as she sails through the sky
The water looks bluer through her pretty eyes
And everyone knows it whenever she flies
And also when she comes down
Hate keeps his head up and walks through these streets
Every stranger and drifter he greets
And shakes hands with every loner he meets
With a serious look on his face
Love arrives safely with suitcase in tow
Carrying with her the good things we know
A reason to live and a reason to grow
To trust and to hold and to care
Hate sits alone on the hood of his car
Without much regard to the moon or the stars
Lazily killing the last of a jar
Of the strongest stuff you can drink
Love takes a taxi, a young man drives
As soon he sees her hope fills his eyes
But tears follow after at the end of the ride
Because he might never see her again
Patience, patience, patience
Hate gets home lucky to still be alive
He screams over the sidewalk and into the drive
The clock in the kitchen says 2:55
And the clock in the kitchen is slow
Love has been waiting patient and kind
Just wanting a phone call or some kind of sign
That the one that she cares for who's out of his mind
Will make it back safe to her arms
Hate stumbles forward and leans in the door
Weary head hung down, eyes to the floor
He says, "Love, I'm sorry," and she says, "What for?
I'm yours and that's it, whatever
I should not have been gone for so long
I'm yours and that's it, forever
Your mine and that's it, forever"This track is an instrumental and has no lyrics.Quanto mais eu penso em lhe deixar
Mais eu sinto que eu nÃ£o posso
Pois eu me prendi a sua vida
Muito mais do que devia
Quando Ã© noite de regresso vocÃª briga por qualquer motivo
Confesso que tenho vontade de ir
Pra bem longe, pra nunca mais te ver
ÃH meu amor, porque brigamos?
NÃ£o posso mais viver assim sempre chorando
A minha paz estou perdendo
A nossa vida deve ser de alegria, pois eu lhe amo tanto
JÃ¡ nÃ£o consigo esquecer as tolices que vocÃª diz nessas horas
JÃ¡ tentei mais nÃ£o posso
Tenho a impressÃ£o que do amor que uma dia existiu entre nÃ³s
Hoje sÃ³ resta uma chama apagando
O medo de ficar sÃ³ me apavora
E eu me desespero
SÃ³ me resta pedir sua ajuda
Pedir que vocÃª nÃ£o me deixe meu amor
ÃH meu amor, porque brigamos?
NÃ£o posso mais viver assim sempre chorando
A minha paz estou perdendo
A nossa vida deve ser de alegriaThere's a family Bible on the table its pages worn and hard to read
But the family Bible on the table will ever be my key to memory
At the end of the day when work was over
And when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us from the family Bible
And we'd count our many blessings one by one
I can see us sittin' round the table as from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me
[ piano ]
This old world of ours is full of troubles this old world would also better be
If we have more Bibles on the tables and mothers singing rock of ages cleft for me
I can see us sittin' round the table...I don't know how many times I've heard it
You can't find it there's no such thing as perfect
But there's a girl out there
Used to sit on my tailgate
Talk about her hometown
She'd take me there someday
There's a girl out there
She danced in her bare feet
Sang along with the radio
Even though she was off key
If you ever meet her you'll know you've seen her I swear
There's a girl out there
She gives the sun a pretty good run for it's beauty
Don't know where she is but the thought of her kiss still moves me, yeah
There's a girl out there
Used to sit on my tailgate
Talk about her hometown
She'd take me there someday
There's a girl out there
She danced in her bare feet
Sang along with the radio
Even though she was off key
If you ever meet her you'll know you've seen her I swear
There's a girl out there
There's a girl out there
Used to sit on my tailgate
Talk about her hometown
She'd take me there someday
There's a girl out there
She danced in her bare feet
Sang along with the radio
Even though she was off key
If you ever meet her you'll know you've seen her I swear
There's a girl out, there's a girl out there
There's a girl out there
I don't know how many times I've heard it
You can't find it there's no such thing as perfect
But there's a girl out thereShe's the only one for me
And I've never seen someone
So trusting, loving
She'd never be untrue
I love her more and more each day
But that doesn't change the fact
She's lonely, unhappy
And there's nothing I can do
('Cause)
She's taken, she's taken
By a man who takes for granted all he has
She's taken and I'm waitin'
Until the day she's taken all she can
He comes home late every night
He doesn't treat her right and now
She's turning, hurting
And that's not how love should be
She needs someone who'll be a friend
Someone who'd love to spend
Every minute with her in it
And that someone could be me
(But)
She's taken, she's taken
By a man who takes for granted all he has
She's taken and I'm waitin'
Until the day she's taken all she canWhat will I do with all those yesterdays where will I go what will I say
How can I live since you have gone away what will I do with all those yesterdays
Tomorrow never bothers me I know what it will bring
It is just another day and it won't mean a thing
But when nighttime falls and mem'ries come to play
What will I do with all those yesterdays
[ guitar ]
Tomorrow never bothers me...You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, "And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."
All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare.
In our town, no scarlet ribbons,
Not one ribbon for her hair.
Through the night my heart was aching.
And just before the dawn was breaking,
I peeked in and on her bed,
In gay profusion lying there,
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.
Scarlet ribbons for her hair.
If I live to be a hundred,
I will never, never know from where,
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair.Boring through the mountains by-passing the towns
Interstate 90 is a sight to behold
But that monument to progress and engineering skill
Has covered up the old swimmin' hole
Thirty feet straight up from where the old hole stood
They sell twenty kinds of icecream and the food is good
But it never can compare with the food for the soul
You could get for a dip in the old swimmin' hole
Oh the old swimmin' hole her cool waters ran deep
Felt good to a boy with mud on his feet
And I'm wishing these days I could strip to my soul
And go for a dip in the old swimmin' hole
A symbol of our great and affluent society Interstate 90 fulfillment of our goals
But that masterpiece of human ingenuity has covered up the old swimmin' hole
Gone the wooden schoolhouse the old country store
The winding dirt road that's winding no more
And the old swimmin' hole hears the sound of speeding wheels
Entombed beneath a blanket of concrete and steel
Oh the old swimmin' holeLately I've found myself fallin'
Deeper in love with you
I'm not the kind of guy
Who gets swept away
So here's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna give you this heart of mine
But that's where I draw the line
[Chorus]
I'm only gonna give you everything
Take it a mile beyond the end of the road
I'm gonna love you one day past forever
But that's as far as it goes
I know it may not sound like much
But baby, make no mistake
I'm gonna treat you with more tenderness
Than any one woman can take
I'm gonna make all your dreams come true
But after that, baby, I'm through
[Chorus]
You've got your limits, I've got mine
I'm only gonna go the distance
Time after time
[Chorus]
But that's as far as it goesGot a old horse
Run loose on the farm
Like a big dog
Don't do no harm
And I live down
A dead end track
Me and my horse
And them chickens out back
Raised five kids
They've all up and gone
Came up rough
Not a one went wrong
When the old woman died
They scattered in the wind
And I never know
When I'll see em again
[Chorus]
I'm an old man
Done all I can
I been working this land
Since I was 24
I'm an old man
Ain't a whole lot going on around here anymore
Had an old dog
Lived 15 years
Train got his leg
Coon got his ear
He loved to hunt
He loved to fight
The way I used to be
On Saturday night
[Chorus]
I still work
A good half a day
Plant a little corn
Cut a little hay
Don't want a die
Until I've lived too long
They'll sell this place
Whenever I'm gone
I miss my sweetheart so
And they way she used to smile
I miss them kids of mine
Runnin' wild
When daylight fades
In late afternoon
Bout all I know is
It was gone to soon
[Chorus]
Ain't a whole log going on around her anymore
Ain't a whole lot going on around her any moreWhen you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friendThis is the thanks I get for loving you
This is the thanks I get for being true
You wouldn't be honest you wouldn't play fair
You know how I've loved you but you didn't care
This is the end I guess we've said goodbye
I'll miss you I'll confess but I won't cry
How can you leave me so lonesome and blue
This is the thanks I get for loving you
How can you leave me so lonesome and blue
This is the thanks I get for loving youDon't choose me because I am faithful.
Don't choose me because I am kind.
If your heart settles on me, I'm for the taking.
Take me for longing or leave me behind.
I would be, for you, a fire in a rainbow,
I would be, for you, an opening door.
Time and hard lessons are one kind of wisdom.
Try to forget them or love me no more.
I'm not asking your heart to believe me.
I'm not asking for promise or pledge.
Whatever the answer, it's yes that's the question.
I am the fool dancin' over the edge.
Don't choose me because I am faithful.
Don't choose me because I am kind.
If your heart settles on me, I'm for the taking.
Take me for longing or leave me behind.I've got some good news, can't wait to tell you.
I realized I missed you, since we've been apart.
I just needed time,
To make up my mind,
But I'm in love with you with all my heart.
I've got some good news.
I got some bad news, I don't know how to break to you.
I found someone new since we been apart.
I had too much time,
An' he took you off my mind,
An' I'm in love with him with all of my heart.
I got some bad news.
An' I guess all is fair in love an' war:
Someone wins,
But someone wins more.
You never know what time will do.
All I know is I've got some good news.
I've got some bad news.Went to bed last night, wasn't sleepy.
Wondering what time you came to me.
You broke my heart, and left lonely.
Now I got nothing left but misery.
Wondering if you, have found another love
Brings no consolation to my heart.
Now one of these days you'll me sorry, (you know you will)
That you filled my heart with misery. (let it swing)
One of these days you?ll be sorry, that you filled my heart with misery. (misery)By David Allan Coe
SHE'S EVERYTHING YOU LOOK FOR IN THAT KIND OF WOMAN
SHELL DRINK WHISKEY AND DANCE TILL THE CHAMPAGNES ALL GONE
SHELL BE RIGHT THERE WHEN THE AIR FROM THE OCEAN IS CALLING
TELLING YOU, SAILOR BEWARE! SOMETHING IS WRONG!
BUT TOUCHING HER MIGHT MAKE YOU LOSE YOUR BLUES TONIGHT
HOLDING HER MIGHT STOP THE PAIN IN TIME
KISSING HER MIGHT TAKE AWAY THE LONELINESS YOU FELL
BUT LOVING HER WILL MAKE YOU LOSE YOUR MIND
JUST LIKE THE MOON AND THE STARS SHELL BE GONE IN THE MORNING
LEAVING YOU EMPTY AND DRAINED, LIKE THE TIDE YOU'LL BE LOW
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO TAKE THAT WILL MAKE IT ALL BETTER
YOU'LL TRY TO BUY HER WITH PRESENTS , BUT SAILOR I KNOW.All I can be
Is a sweet memory
That drifts through your mind
From time to time
I can never be more
Than a knock on your door
Just a shadow that's gone
With the sunshine
For you know I'm not free
And I never can be
And you're bound
To get restless in time
All I can be
Is a sweet memory
That drifts through your mind
Tonight I shed
A silent tear
While lyin' here with you
The sands of time
Have trickled down
To just a precious few
You're young and so beautiful
And I'm so glad I'm here
But the ending is painfully clear
All I can be
Is a sweet memory
Of someone you had
To leave behind
Who loves you and needs you
But never could give you
The ring for your finger so fine
So tonight we'll just borrow
Each other tomorrow
We'll find that we've run out of time
And all I can be
Is a sweet memory
That drifts through your mind
For you know I'm not free
All I can be
Is a sweet memory
That drifts through your mindYears from now, I'll want you years from now
I'll hold you years from now as I hold you tonight
You are my one true friend always my one true friend
And I'll love you till life's end, as I love you tonight
I know this world that we live in can be hard now and then
And it will be again, many times we've been down
Still love has kept us together for the flame never dies
When I look in your eyes the future I see
Holding you years from now
Wanting you years from now
Loving you years from now
As I love you tonightThey're telling me to stop singing country
That kind of music ain't much chop
Record company man said hey Mr. Brand
Why don't you start singing some pop
You'll make more money, you'll get more honeys
That's the way to go
Well I thought for a second and a second's all it took and said
Nah, I don't think so
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah I don't think so
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah I don't think so
I don't think so
I've been doing my best to please her
Even made her breaky in bed
Cleaned up the yard, polished her car
Put the rusty old ute in the shed
But when she said hon, we're going to mum's
And this time you've gotta go
Well I thought for a second and a second's all it took and said
Nah, I don't think so
They tell me I should get me a sail boat
A skipper on a yacht I should be
Fresh sea air, breeze in my hair
Sounds like way too much fun to me
'Cause I've got a need for V8 speed
And it ain't a race if tyres don't smoke
Well I thought for a second and a second's all it took and said
Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah I don't think soAnyone who's ever had a heart
Wouldn't turn around and break it
And anyone who's ever played a part
Wouldn't turn around and hate it
Sweet Jane, sweet Jane
Sweet, sweet Jane
You're waiting for Jimmy down in the alley
Waiting there for him to come back home
Waiting down on the corner
And thinking of ways to get back home
Sweet Jane, sweet Jane
Sweet, sweet Jane
Anyone who's ever had a dream
Anyone who's ever played a part
Anyone who's ever been lonely
And anyone who's ever split apart
Sweet Jane, sweet Jane
Sweet, sweet Jane
Heavenly widened roses
Seem to whisper to me when you smile
Heavenly widened roses
Seem to whisper to me when you smileCross around your neck but the way that you're dancin'
Girl, its flirtin' with the dirty side
Bet that cotton dress is hidin' a tattoo
That you're wantin' somebody to find
Bought you a shot of whiskey
I thought you'd be sippin' it
When I turned around you'd already finished it, finished it
You're the good, you're the good
You're the good kinda bad
You're the best shot of trouble I ever had
Got a mile wide wild side, a beautiful crazy
Wherever you wanna take me
I'm in for a ride on the dangerous side
I'm ready for the devil in that angel smile
I can see you being the fix I gotta have
'Cause girl, you're the good kinda bad
Keep every boy in town wrapped around your finger
But there ain't no diamond ring
You kind of like the thought of forever
But you love that freedom thing
Strap fallin' off your shoulder
Love the way you just leave it there
I move in just a little closer
Think I'll take that dare
You're the good, you're the good
You're the good kinda bad
You're the best shot of trouble I ever had
Got a mile wide wild side, a beautiful crazy
Wherever you wanna take me
I'm in for a ride on the dangerous side
I'm ready for the devil in that angel smile
I can see you being the fix I gotta have
'Cause girl, you're the good kinda bad
You're a little lemonade and a lotta Jack Daniels
I want all I can handle
You're the good, you're the good
You're the good kinda bad
You're the best shot of trouble I ever had
Got a mile wide wild side, a beautiful crazy
Wherever you wanna take me
I'm in for a ride on the dangerous side
I'm ready for the devil in that angel smile
I can see you being the fix I gotta have
'Cause girl, you're the good kinda bad
You're the good, you're the good kinda bad
You're the good, you're the good kinda bad
Wherever you want to take me
The good kind of bad
You're the good, you're the good kinda bad
You're the good, you're the good kinda bad
I can see you being the fix I gotta haveThat's just that
He's not talkin' and she's not speakin'
And they're not budgin' and that's just that
He's just fumin' and she's just steamin'
And they're not listening to the fact
That hearts are cryin' and love is dyin'
And neither wants to understand
Cause he's not talkin' and she's not speakin'
And they're not budgin'
But they used to stroll in the rain
Then build a fire and pull the shades
They kissed their way all through the dark
She's whisper all her deepest dreams
He'd tell her she's his everything
She'd lay her head down on his heart
They were so in love
Yeah they were so in love
He's not talkin' and she's not speakin'
And they're not budgin' and that's just that
Hope is crumblin' and walls are tumblin'
It's all just jumpin right off the tracks
And doors are slammin' and heels are stompin'
And they're both walkin' their separate ways
And he's not talkin' and she's not speakin'
And they're not budgin'
But they used to jump in his car
They're side by side without a care
Drive till the scenery was right
Lay on a blanket on the ground
And watch the clouds blow around
Just holdin' each other tight
They were so in love
Yeah they were so in love
They were so in love
Yeah they were so in love
If he'd start talkin' and she'd start speakin'
And they'd start tryin' they'd start to see
That's it's worth keepin' and they're worth savin'
And they're not far from what they need
To start forgivin' and start relivin'
All the love they used to have
So he starts budgin' and she starts biddin'
And he stops steepin' and she starts givin'
And they start cryin', and they start hopin', and they start talkin'.
Then, they take a stroll in the rain.
And build a fire, pull the shades.
Kiss their way all through the dark.
She whispers all her deepest dreams.
He tells her she's his everything.
She lays her head down on his heart.
They're so in love.
Yeah, they are so in love.
And that's just thatI need something strong tonight
I'm needing me a hundred proof
Something to erase my mind
Rid me of the thought of you
Ain't gonna water it down when I say it out loud
I'm gonna mean it when I'm telling you goodbye
You're looking in my eyes, but seeing somebody else
Yeah, I never should have fell
Yeah, boy, you're nothing but a chaser
You're looking at me and thinking of her
And it cuts me like a razor
And you ain't doing me any kind of favors
Sticking around this one-horse town tonight
You can follow her tracks, you can try to win her back
Put the miles on your tires 'til you run out of gas
I'm done letting you be my heartbreaker
So go ahead and chase her
Yeah, the grass ain't always greener
Over on the other side
You never learn when you're a leaver
It's just a part of your design
'Cause you're the kind that can't stay for too long in a sad place
You'll be looking for me when you change your mind
Yeah, boy, you're nothing but a chaser
You're looking at me and thinking of her
And it cuts me like a razor
And you ain't doing me any kind of favors
Sticking around this one-horse town tonight
You can follow her tracks, you can try to win her back
Put the miles on your tires 'til you run out of gas
I'm done letting you be my heartbreaker
So go ahead and chase her
So go ahead and chase her
It's the thrill, it's the hunt, it's the love of the game
It's the get what you want and then you throw it away
It's the rush of the fall, not the land
It's the catch her if you can, catch her, catch her if you can
Yeah, boy, you're nothing but a chaser
And it cuts me like a razor
You ain't doing me any kind of favors tonight
You can follow her tracks, you can try to win her back
Put the miles on your tires 'til you run out of gas
I'm done letting you be my heartbreaker
So go ahead and chase her
So go ahead and chase her
It's the thrill, it's the hunt, it's the love
Catch her if you can, catch her, catch her if you can
It's the thrill, it's the hunt, it's the love
Catch her if you can, catch her, catch her if you canI've got to get used to being lonely and get used to knowing darling that you're gone
But how can I prepare myself without you when I can't get used to being all alone
I've got to get used to being lonely and say this is the last day of being blue
But how can I look forward to tomorrow
When I can't get used to knowing I've lost you
For things to change I must have you to change them
Cause I'm not own I don't have fate in me
But loneliness is all I have without you cause I can't get used to being this lonely
[ steel ]
For things to change...She use to be my rosa amarilla
My little Mexicali tomatilla
But then one night I drank too much sangria
Woke up and found a note that said I'll see ya
(Chorus)
Oh, my baby no esta aqui no more
My baby no esta aqui no more
She left me here with nada
Broke my heart like a pinata
My baby no esta aqui no more
Whoa, whoa, whoa, if you see her
Please, please tell her that I need her
I used to be her number one vaquero
Her numero uno caballero
But I've had to hock my spurs and my sombrero
'Cause when she left she took all my dinero
(Repeat Chorus)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, if you see her
Please, please tell her that I need her
Oh, my baby no esta aqui no more
My baby no esta aqui no more
she left me here with nada
Broke my heart like a pinata
My baby no esta aqui
My baby no esta aqui
My baby no esta aqui no moreLove goes out, out like a light.
Out like a flame and you cant find find it anymore.
Just when you think its lost in the rain, it comes back knockin' at your door.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
And around.
God put us here on this carnival ride.
We close our eyes, never knowing where it'll take us next.
Babies are born, and at the same time, someone's taking their last breath.
Its the wheel of the world.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
In the blink of an eye, it can change your life.
And it never even slows down.
Its the wheel of the world.
I don't know what it is, I'm flying high, but I'm wondering why I'm sinking on this ship going down.
Life keeps on moving anyway.
It's the wheel of the world.
It's the wheel of the world turning around.
It's the wheel of the world.
It's the wheel of the world turning around.
It's the wheel of the world turning around.
And around.
And around.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
It can open your heart, it can break you apart.
And it never even slows down.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
And around.Sometimes she's a child I love her that way her little girl smile just begging to play
But when I'm confused and when I am weak
She rocks me gently takes me to her bosom
Feeds me her love and gives me her strenghts
She's velvet and steel (she's gentle and strong)
She's a lamb (she's a tiger) and I'll stand beside her
My beautiful spider spinning her web of velvet and steel
[ strings ]
Blow in my mind like a soft evening breeze she's patient and kind so anxious to please
But she's like a storm if she needs to be
Like a tornado wiping out anything that gets in her way she does it for me
She's velvet and steel...Way down at the bottom of the river
There's a locket with a picture of me
She drowned what I thought was forever
She locked up our love and lost the key
A friend of mine heard from a friend of hers
She was workin' on last name number three
There was a time I'd have relished those words
But I'm not where I used to be
Way down, weighted down at the bottom
I almost drown in a shallow dream
A light shined down and life was waiting at the top
When I let go of the past that was draggin' me
Way down, on an Oklahoma highway
There's a cafe where they'll remember me
I broke down by a pay phone in the hallway
Put my fist through a drywall sheet
I hit a wall trying to find some kinda way
To find some peace
Buried it all when I dug a grave
For all the pain that was pulling me
Way down, weighted down at the bottom
I almost drown in a shallow dream
A light shined down and life was waiting at the top
When I let go of the past that was dragging me, way down
Way down, way down, way down
Way down, way down, way downHummingbird, hummingbird should be your name
Too restless to settle, too wild to tame
Too restless to settle, too wild to tame
Hummingbird, hummingbird should be your name
Hummingbird, hummingbird winging along
No tender young blossom can hold you for long
No tender young blossom can hold you for long
Hummingbird, hummingbird winging along
You'd hug me and kiss me like others I've known
You'd promise to love me and call me your own
Then all of my dreams would be shattered apart
By the hum hum of your hummingbird heart
Hummingbird, hummingbird, feathered so fine
If I clipped your wings it would not make you mind
If I clipped your wings it would not make you mind
Hummingbird, hummingbird, feathered so fine
Hummingbird, hummingbird, fly right on by
Some folks like to gamble, but darling not I
Some folks like to gamble, but darling not I
Hummingbird, hummingbird, fly right on by
I'd rather be lonely, I'd rather be blue
Yes, I'd rather spend my whole life without you
Then feather a nest to be shattered apart
By the hum, hum of your hummingbird heart
By the hum, hum of your hummingbird heart.I never believed the woman like you existed
Somewhere along the way my mind got twisted
But you brought hope and understanding gave sweet love without demanding
How could I ever dream the more than this
Let's build a world together just for two
Let's put our dreams together and watch them all come true
Let's leave the world of tears and heartaches far behind
Let's build a world together yours and mine
We fill our world with music and children's laughter
And cherrish every hour we spend together
And every night we rediscover just how much we love each other
And dream about the things we'll do tomorrow
Let's build a world together...
Let's build a world together yours and mineJody like a melody
play inside my head
till the thought of you is more than I can stand
just to think of having you is music to my soul
you make me feel
as though the world is in my hands
jody like a melody
you warm me
and then leave me
with a chill
I can't believe the sun will rise
without me looking in your eyes
and knowing that your love has made me strong
why you left I'll never know
the fire you built will always glow
I only know I woke to find you gone
jody like a melody
you warm me
and then leave me
with a chill
jody, I can't keep my thoughts
about me in the daytime
when your memory is enough to make me blind
and late at night I lie awake
and wait for you to come and when you don't
you know I almost lose my mind
jody like a melody
you warm me
and then leave me
with a chill
jody like a melody...(Black sheep black sheep)
This world holds many mysteries that I don't understand
One is why the wanderlust is born in the heart of a man
I kissed young lips that thrilled me so and set my soul on fire
I'm a black sheep boy and I just can't find the lips my heart desire
Black sheep (black sheep) black sheep (black sheep)
Why do I have to roam why can't I have a happy heart like other guys I've known
This wanderlust in my hungry heart keeps me on the road
I'm a black sheep boy there's a lot more oats that we've gotta sow
Black sheep (black sheep) black sheep (black sheep)
I've known life I've tasted love from a girl that's true and sweet
She haunts me in my dreams at night and I can hardly sleep
I won her self fancy then but my wondering heart says no
Black sheep boy with lot more places we've gotta go
Black sheep (black sheep)
I can hear my mama say as she sits there all alone
My black sheep boy is a coming back never more to roam
Black sheep (black sheep)
Black sheep (black sheep) black sheep (black sheep) black sheep (black sheep)I know what it means to be lonesome
And I know what it means to be blue
I know what it means to be lonesome in dreams
When there is no one at home for you
Well my baby left me this morning
As the clock was striking four
The sweet smiling face of my darling
I may never see any more
Well I've cried and I've cried since we parted
No one knows what I have been through
You know I'd give all I own just to have you back home
I'm lonesome, lonesome for youWell a man can't spend his life in reflection,
Just thinkin' about the way things used to be.
So I'm gonna take myself a new direction,
And make myself some brand new memories.
Well I spent lots of years out on that highway,
Ridin' buckin' horses for my grub.
But now I make my livin' with this ole guitar.
And just like rodeo it's in my blood.
And now I'm gonna sing my cowboy music,
With a country feelin' and a little touch of soul.
And I hope you people take a likin' to it. yes I do!
'cause I can't ride the bronco's anymore
Now I make you a wager, that I've been in your hometown.
Ridin' broncs in your big rodeo,
But now the only time you'll ever see this cowboy come around.
Is if I'm singin' in a country music show.
And now I'm gonna sing my cowboy music,
With a country feelin' and a little touch of soul.
And I hope you people take a likin' to it. yes I do!
'cause I can't ride the broncos anymore.
My whole body's gettin' to dang tired and sore.
And there's a lot of parts on me that don't work no more..Well I really had a ball last night
I held all the pretty boys tight
I was feelin' single seein' double
Wound up in a whole lot of trouble
But today I'll face the big fight but
I really had a ball last night
When I came home from work this mornin'
My baby was feelin' low
And he told me what was on his mind
Then he told me where I could go
Well I didn't want to go where he told me to
Cause the water was cold in the lake
Now there's somethin' fishy 'bout this whole deal
I don't see where I made my mistake
When I woke up this mornin'
Like me the sun was high
Well I started walkin' the long way home
Just to think of an alibi
Well I couldn't think of a doggone thing
That hadn't already been said
So I guess I better just play it by ear
For I'm already dead
But today I'll face the big fight but
I really had a ball last nightLet there be not one stranger to away in a manger
Let there be not one soul left untold
Let there be not one face unknown to the face of the one
Who will gather the foe
For Christ's sake, it's Christmas
So for Christ sake, let everyone know
They all have the choice, so lift up your voice
Make sure they know
By Christmas Eve
Pray that everyone sees that we've opened the eyes
That were closed
For Christ's sake, it's Christmas
And for Christ's sake, let everyone know
For Christ's sake, it's Christmas
So for Christ sake, let everyone know
They all have the choice, so lift up your voice

And for Christ's sake, let everyone knowWhy hey there why you look so sad?
What did he say to make you feel so bad?
Well I guarantee that I'd never do nothing like that, no.
So what you got planned on Friday night?
Could put your red dress on or stay home and cry.
I guarantee I got a quick fix that you might like, that's right.
Well you might find love,
Or maybe just a good time.
But you won't know baby till you get out the house
Get a little drinky drink and turn it up loud
Tequila, a little salt, a little lime
They say you can't a drown a broken heart but guess what,
You can damn sure try.
Don't you wanna try, babe?
Come on, give it a shot, give it a dance
I ain't asking a lot, just give me a chance
I'm gonna right his wrong right where I stand
I'ma hit you with a kiss, spinning like a hurricane
Tell me baby what do ya say?
Well you might find love,
Or maybe just a good time.
But you won't know baby till you get out the house
Get a little drinky drink and turn it up loud
Tequila, a little salt, a little lime
They say you can't a drown a broken heart but guess what,
You can damn sure try.
Don't you wanna try, babe?
Turn the lights down low, boots on the floor
If you want a little more I got money in my pocket
Go on, let yourself go, feel the banjo
Well you might find love,
Or maybe just a good time.
But you won't know baby till you get out the house
Get a little drinky drink and turn it up loud
Tequila, a little salt, a little lime

Say hey good lookin' whatcha got cooking how's about cooking something up with me
[ guitar - steel ]
I'm free and ready so we can go steady so how's about saving all your time for me
No more lookin' I know I've been tooken how's about keepin' steady company
I'm gonna throw my datebook over the fence and find me one for five or ten cents
I'll keep it till it's covered with age cause I'm writin' your name down on every page
Say hey good lookin' whatcha got cooking how's about cooking something up with meIn a shingle covered cottage at the foothills of blue stacks
Near a mountain stream that's flowing crystal clear
Where the humming birds and honey bees feed on Mama's roses
My mem'ries just grow sweeter with the years
Mem'ries of my childhood are as sweet as mountain honey
And as fresh as a dew on morning glory vines
I grew up surrounded by the sights and sounds of nature
And they're forever present in my mind
But I'm headed in the wrong direction home
Headed in the wrong direction home
There's no place like home
But I'm headed in the wrong direction home
Teardrops mingled with the summer rain that was a falling
The day I left my mountain home behind
With a suitcase in my hand and a hope in my heart
I was following a dream I had to find
In that shingled covered cottage at the foothills of the smokies
Waits a family hat I'm longing to see
And mountain streams and fields of green
And rolling hills stay in my dreams
But I'm many, many miles from TennesseePlease, please have pity on me
Oh can't you see that I'm in misery
Please, please I'm begging like a fool
Whoa is me look who's blue
There ain't no girl that's ever gonna tie me down
I'm going out each night to paint the town
Well I was doing fine till I met you
Whoa is me look who's blue
Please, please have pity on me
Oh can't you see that I'm in misery
Please, please I'm begging like a fool
Whoa is me look who's blue
Please, please have pity on me
Oh can't you see that I'm in misery
Please, please I'm begging like a foolThis is the love song that I never gave you.
I didn't know where or how to begin.
And it doesn't matter and it won't save you from
runnin' or lying in the arms of a woman or man,
That's just you, and I'm just me, we're still us and where we could of known
These are the tears that I surely owe you
You just got the better from the pillar of salt of my rage
And while these tears aren't sweet, they fall so sweetly
Oh the fountain of youth is dry and I'm feeling my age, how about you?
Forever young. Blond hair, blue eyes in the sun.
And these are the words that I never told you.
You're absolved, you're forgiven for any and all your sin.
And where I don't stray I follow behind Him, oh the Kingdom's gone
And it will not come again. Not for you. Not for me. Both of us are now free.
So free. Free.
Ya this is the love song that I never gave youThere's a foreign movie
Up on your silver screen
Black and white and silent
If you don't count the screams
From where you are sitting
It all seems so real
Everyone who's seen it
Knows the way you feel
Wake up baby dreamer
Wipe the sleep from your eyes
Look behind the curtain
Such a beautiful sunrise
Sometimes a flight of fancy
Falls down from the clouds
You don't have to worry
For crying out loudSoft clouds all drift away
Bright sunshine never stays
Warm afternoons turn rainy
Dark and cruel
A candle's glowing light will die
The purest voices often lie
And with love I've found
That all the same is true
Even though I should know better
I guess we could maybe try
There is the risk
Of looking like a fool
But I've got a lucky feeling
Just a hunch, don't ask me why
You might be an exception
To the rule
Sweet dreams can't be recalled
High hopes collapse and fall
As the sky keeps turning
Sadder shades of blue
The strongest promise, finally breaks
And only leads to bigger aches
Are lessons that I learned
At sorrow's school
Even though I should know better
I guess we could maybe try
There is the risk
Of looking like a fool
But I've got a lucky feeling
Just a hunch, don't ask me why
You might be an exception
To the rule
Even though I should know better
I guess we could maybe try
There is the risk
Of looking like a fool
But I've got a lucky feeling
Just a hunch, don't ask me why
You might be an exception
To the rule
Soft clouds all drift away
And bright sunshine never stays
But you might be an exception
To the ruleI see your van you're a guitar man it's written all over your face
To make it big you quit your gig a playin' bass at the airbase
You've come to town you've been turned down but it's just a question of taste
Don't think you're too good for country music just because you can rock and roll
Likely as not your licks are hot but you won't work much here in Nashville
You're really keen on BB King but they don't cut him here in Nashville
And if you don't pick them country licks you can bet somebody else will
Don't think you're too good for country music just because you can rock and roll
(Pickin' good pickin' good pickin' good sound like hell but pickin' good)
You're really hot on ZZ Tott but you ain't doin' any session
Your licks are neat but you won't eat until you learn one little lesson
You boogie good and I knew you could but they don't boogie much in Nashville
Don't think you're too good for country music just because you can rock and rollWon't it ever be morning won't the dawn ever break
Won't it ever quit hurting how much can I take
A man could go crazy in the shape that I'm in
I love you and miss you so much won't it ever be morning again
It's barely twelve o'clock but I've already spent a lifetime
Just sitting here and wishing it was any time but nighttime
Outside the winds are moaning low and I just heard it thunder
Your picture on the wall just laughed at me and I just wonder
Won't it ever be morning
I love you and miss you so much won't it ever be morning againShe was a good companion, eyes like the Grand Canyon
She was an American beauty
She was a long goodbye, she was the best alibi
She was an American beauty
With her Wayfarers on in the summer sun
Her touch felt like a loaded gun
Wish I had held her longer
Wish I had held her long
A gorgeous vagabond, she was sweet but she was strong
She was an American beauty
She was dÃ©jÃ  vu, she was a catch-22
She was an American beauty
Her blue eyes shine in the summer sun
Her kiss felt like a loaded gun
Wish I had held her longer
Wish I had held her long
Goodbye came like the morning sun
She fired shots from a loaded gun
Wish I had held her longer
Wish I had held her long
She was a good companion
Eyes like the Grand Canyon
She was an American beautyI'm going to the racetrack to see my pony run
If he won some money, gonna take my good gals on
Yeah, you don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing, I'm laughing just to keep from crying
I left my frump standing in the door, lookin' after me a-crying say
"You won't come back no more, sweet daddy"
You don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing, I'm laughing just to keep from crying
When I asked my mama, "Can you stand to say goodbye?"
She said, "Yes, sweet papa, if you can stand to see me cry, Lord"
You don't know, ooh, my mind
Oh, when you see me laughing, honey, laughing just to keep from crying
I got a handful o' nickels, got a pocketful o' dimes
Got a houseful o' youngens and no one mind
Lord, you don't know, you don't know my mind
And when you see me laughing, I'm laughing just to keep from cryingWas one thousand dollars wedding, supposed to be held the other day
And with all the invitations sent
The young bride went away
When the groom saw people passing notes
Not unusual, he might say
But where are the flowers for my baby
I'd even like to see her mean old mama
And why ain't there a funeral, if you're gonna act that way
I hate to tell you how he acted when the news arrived
He took some friends out drinking and it's lucky they survived
'Cause he told them everything there was to tell there along the way
And he felt so bad when he saw the traces of old lies still on their faces
So why don't someone here just spike his drink
Why don't you do him in some old way
Supposed to be a funeral
It's been a bad, bad day
The Reverend Dr. William Grace
Was talking to the crowd
All about the sweet child's holy face and
The saints who sung out loud
And he swore the fiercest beasts
Could all be put to sleep the same silly way
And where are the flowers for the girl
She only knew she loved the world
And why ain't there one lonely horn and one sad note to play
Supposed to be a funeral
It's been a bad, bad day
Supposed to be a funeral
It's been a bad, bad dayIn the papers I saw you this morning
You were lovely dressed in your wedding gown
And it said you would marry a stranger, to me
That had drifted into our old home town
Accident'ly you met him one ev'ning
And you say it was love at first sight
Accident'ly on purpose you're marryin'
Accident'ly on purpose, for spite
For you say that you saw me out painting the town
That I was just a fool with the heart of a clown
Accident'ly you were mistaken that night
Accident'ly on purpose, for spite
Yes, you say that you saw me out painting the town
That I was just a fool with the heart of a clown
Accident'ly you were mistaken that night
Accident'ly on purpose, for spiteIt breaks my hear to see
That you're unhappy here with me
The hurt you've tried to hide can't help but show
I could cling to the past
But I'm afraid it wouldn't last
And I love you enough to let you go
Don't think that I'm all through
Or that I'm givin' up on you
Our love's the most important thing I know
But if I set you free
It just might bring you back to me
And I love you enough to let you go
[Chorus]
I'll stand and hold the door
And watch you walk away
And welcome you back with open arms
If you come back someday
But for now it would be wrong
To keep tryin' to hold on
And I love you enough to let you go
[Chorus]I've been a havin' some hard travelin' I thought you know
I've been a havin' some hard travelin' way down the road
I've been a havin' some hard travelin' hard ramblin' hard gamblin'
I've been a havin' some hard travelin' Lord
Well I've been a ridin' them fast rattlers I thought you know
I've been a ridin' them blind passengers way down the road
I've been a ridin' them dead ends and flat wheelers kickin' up cinders
I've been a havin' some hard travelin' Lord
[ banjo - dobro ]
Well I've been a layin' in a hard rock jeil I thought you know
I've been a layin' there ninety days way down the road
Mean old judge said to me it's ninety days for vagrancy
I've been a havin' some hard travelin' Lord
I've been a workin' at Pittsburgh Steel I thought you know
I've been a dumpin' that red hot slag way down the road
I've been a blastin' I've been firin' I've been a pourin' that red hot iron
I've been a havin' some hard travelin' Lord
[ banjo - fiddle ]
I've been a hittin' some hard harvest and I thought you know
North Dakota to Kansas City way down the road
Cuttin' that wheat stackin' that hay tryin' to make about a dollar a day
I've been a havin' some hard travelin' Lord
I've been a workin' on Lincoln Highway I thought you know
I've been a hitchin' on 66 way down the road
Heavy load and worried mind lookin' for woman that's hard to find
I've been a havin' some hard travelin' LordIf you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you
Baby, we're really in love
If you're happy with me like I'm happy with you
Old Cupid just gave us a shove
If you're thinkin' of me like I'm thinkin' of you
I know what you're thinkin' of
If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you
Baby, we're really in love
Well, I run around in circles
And turn in fire alarms
I'm nut as fruit bake
When you're not in my arms
If you're meant for me like I'm meant for you
Baby, we fit like a glove
If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you
Baby, we're really in love
If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you
Baby, we're really in love
If you're countin' on me like I'm countin' on you
Old Cupid just gave us a shove
If you're dreamin' of me like I'm dreamin' of you
I know what you're dreamin' of
If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you
Baby, we're really in loveSweeter than the grapes growin' out in California
Softer than the fuzz on the sweetest Georgia peach
Warms you goin' down like a twenty-two year old brandy
When she loves me, Lord, she's fine, fine as wine
She loves her rodeo, man, turns him every way but loose
Washes out all his Levis, shines his cowboy boots
Watches him each Saturday bitin' the dust again
She takes him home, puts him to bed and rubs in the lineament
She's sweeter than the grapes growin' out in California
Softer than the fuzz on the sweetest Georgia peach
Warms you goin' down like a twenty-two year old brandy
When she loves me, Lord, she's fine, fine as wine
Layin' in the back seat with sugar at the wheel
Broken bones from my last ride is all my head can feel
Sugar, sure gets tired, Lord, of all I put her through
But I'll never find another gal who's sweeter or is true
She's sweeter than the grapes growin' out in California
Softer than the fuzz on the sweetest Georgia peach
Warms you goin' down like a twenty-two year old brandy
When she loves me, Lord, she's fine, fine as wine
Sweeter than the grapes growin' out in California
Softer than the fuzz on the sweetest Georgia peach
Warms you goin' down like a twenty-two year old brandy
When she loves me, Lord, she's fine, fine as wineTo this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there all night long
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on fire and born to run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang, oh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go
When I think about you, I think about seventeen
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night, Springsteen
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name
I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm
Baby is it spring or is it summer
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear 'Born in the USA'
You relive those glory days
So long ago
When you think about me, do you think about seventeen
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen, Springsteen
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night

Whoa-oh-oh-ohWelcome to my world
Won't you come on in
Miracles I guess
Still happen now and then
Step into my heart
Leave your cares behind
Welcome to my world
Built with you in mind
Knock and the door will open
Seek and you will find
Ask and you'll be given
The key to this world of mine
I'll be waiting here
With my arms unfurled
Waiting just for you
Welcome to my world
Knock and the door will open
Seek and you will find
Ask and you'll be given
The key to this world of mine
I'll be waiting here
With my arms unfurled
Waiting just for you
Welcome to my world
Waiting just for you
Welcome to my worldI was just a lonely boy stickin' close to home
Content to be there with my folks without a thought to roam
But late one night a change of my mind turned to left down low
This was the time I had to find where that gravel road did go
I got into a city about the break of day
All worn out from a long long walk I stopped at a small cafe
They served me coffee black and strong they were servin' liquor too
And I saw this girl with honey hair and eyes of visual blue
My heart jumped right into my throat I thought that it would fail
Too green to see the invisible sign wild honey keep for sale
I walked right in sat right down and soon my plans were made
A lonely boy too starved for love too dumb to be afraid
Her every wish was my command it only took a smile
And I spent my hard earned money like it was goin' out of style
Now there's no money in my jeans and you find to to be her man
I have to the things she ask with the pocketful in my hand
I'll take my heart back to the farm with mem'ries quite a few
Where the angry buzz and the sting of the bee is only harm wild honey can do
Where the angry buzz and the sting of the bee is only harm wild honey can doEighteen years had come and gone
For mama they flew by
But for me they drug on and on
We were loading up that Chevy
Both tryin' not to cry
Mama kept on talking
Putting off goodbye
Then she took my hand and said
"Baby, don't forget
Before you hit the highway
You better stop for gas
There's a fifty in the ashtray
In case you run short on cash
Here's a map, and here's a Bible
If you ever lose your way
Just one more thing before you leave
Don't forget to remember me."
This downtown apartment sure makes me miss home
And those bills there on the counter
Keep telling me I'm on my own
And just like every Sunday I called mama up last night
And even when it's not, I tell her everything's all right
Before we hung up I said
"Hey mama, don't forget
To tell my baby sister
I'll see her in the fall
And tell Me-maw that I miss her
Yeah, I should give her a call
And make sure you tell daddy
That I'm still his little girl
Yeah, I still feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be
But don't forget to remember me."We got owners, favorite drivers,
Boy, that Tony Stewart's a whiner.
And we got rookies, advertisers,
Like uhhh let's say: Havoline, Target, Sharpie, Caterpillar, Nextel,
Mountain Dew, Dupont, Lowe's, Home Depot, Kodak, M&Ms;, UPS, Tide, Alltel, Gillette, Kelloggs, Viagra, Dewalt, and uhhh Budweiser.
But the trophy girls still have my favorite parts.
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, I love NASCAR.
We got cautions, we got pitstops,
You can't hear a dang thing once the flag drops.
And poor Kyle Petty, an' Swervin' Marlin, ha ha,
Are gonna find it tough to beat Mark Martin.
'Cause that Viagra car is always driven hard.
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, I love NASCAR.
I love NASCAR, it's my kind of race.
Just watchin' Jeff Gordon plow up a wall,
Puts a smile on Dale Jr.'s face.
No caviar, it's beer and Mopar.
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, I love NASCAR.
I like short tracks, you'll see more wrecks,
And about a million screamin' rednecks.
And ol' Jeff Burton, ha, an' poor Mike Skinner,
Well, they've done forgot what it's like to be a winner.
And Ken Schrader still ain't sure who his sponsors are.
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, I love NASCAR.
"Hey, that was a close one up there fellas I about got into one there.
I might pull over right up here next pitstop, I want you to get two right front tires.
I need a wedge on the left side, get this windsheild cleaned, get on the gas.
And if you don't care, hand me a pair of underwear, I have messed all in my drawers."
I like football. (I like football.)
I like my wrestlin'.
I like a good game of air hockey,
I like some ping-pong now an' then.
How about you, Toby?
(Toby)
I love NASCAR, it's my kind of race.
Just to see Big E back on the track,
Would put a smile on every face.
No one drove a car quite like Earnhardt.
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, I love NASCAR.
(Both)
Vroom, vroom, vroom
(Toby)
Gentlemen, start your engines
(Both)
I love NASCAR.Your cheatin' heart will make you weep you'll cry and cry and try to sleep
But sleep won't come the whole night through your cheatin' heart will tell on you
When tears come down like falling rain you'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do your cheatin' heart will tell on you
Your cheatin' heart will pine someday and crave the love you threw away
The time will come when you'll be blue your cheatin' heart will tell on you
When tears come downBack in my day I was always
Cruisin' the road on Sunday
Makin' those tires spin your way
Yeah, it seems like yesterday
We'd go swingin' on the front porch
You were all mine and I was all yours
Yeah, those are the days I miss
A ten minute ride, I could make it in five
This might sound crazy but maybe
You're thinkin' 'bout me tonight
'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout you tonight
Somethin' 'bout the taste of a first love, first touch
That don't ever seem to fade
Now you're six hundred miles away
And a ten hour drive
But if you called me tonight,
I can make it in five
The last I heard you were on the west coast
Looking hotter than a Texas summer
Yeah girl, I can't help but wonder
What you've seen, what you've missed
What you've felt, who've you kissed
Girl, you never crossed my mind
Yeah, you stay there all the time
And this might sound crazy but maybe
You're thinkin' 'bout me tonight
'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout you tonight
Somethin' 'bout the taste of a first love, first touch
That don't ever seem to fade
Now you're six hundred miles away
And a ten hour drive
But if you called me tonight,
I could make it in five
I don't know how many nights that I've spent starin' at this phone
Lookin' for your area code or some number, yeah, that I don't know
But the one that came up tonight is the one I've known all my life
It's your mama's place and I heard your pretty voice say
This might sound crazy
But are you thinkin' 'bout me tonight?
'Cause I'm thinking' 'bout you tonight, yeah
Somethin' 'bout the taste of a first love, first touch
That don't ever seem to fade
And I just need to see your face
It's a ten minute drive, this ol' truck's gonna fly
I'll be there in five
Yeah baby, sit tight
Yeah, I'll be there in five, yeah
I'll be there in five,
This ol' truck's gonna fly
I'll be there in five(Dolly Parton)
I thought I saw the promise of forever in your eyes
I thought that I was sure of what I saw
You led me to believe that I was special in your life
So I left my heart wide open for the fall
I thought I'd found a safe and loving place inside your heart;
And I was warm and willing any time
The same soft lips that kissed me sweet were lying from the start
But I swear I thought your love was genuine
What a heartache you turned out to be
What a heartache, what a heartache,
Like a switchblade that cuts quick and deep
Oh, what a heartache, what a heart break,
Love ain't always what it appears to be
Oh, what a heartache you turned out to be
It just goes to show that you never can tell
'Cause I really thought that I knew you well
I still can't believe I could be deceived so easily
Are all these wishes I'm wishin' to myself
Just rusty coins in a wishin' well?
Wishes come true, they come false as well
It's too late for you and me
Oh, what a heartache you turned out to be
What a heartache, what a heartache,
Love is two-faced and easy to deceive
Oh, what a heartache, what a heartache,
What a mistake to think I could believe
What a heartache, what a heartache,
Like a switchblade that cuts quick and deep
Ooh, what a heartache you turned out to be
What a heartache, what a heartache,
What a heartache, what a heartache,
What a heartache.
Ooh, what a heartache you turned out to be
Ooh, what a heartache
Oh, what a heartache,
What a heart break you turned out to beTime can pass and time can heal
But it don't ever pass the way I feel
You went away a long time ago
And why you left I never knew
The lonely days and lonely nights
Guess the world knows I ain't feelin' right
And when you're gone the hours pass so slow
And now I'm still feeling blue, yeah
And baby
Since you've walked out of my life
I never felt so low
Can't help but wonder why you had to go
There are many girls but I can't say
They come and go but still I feel this way
And ever since the day you said goodbye
No one treats me like you used to do
I hope you're out and happy now
Doing up the town 'cause you know how
Every time I hear your name I want to die
And now I'm still feeling blue, all right
And baby
Since you've walked out of my life
I never felt so low
Can't help but wonder why you had to go
There are many girls but I can't say
They come and go but still I feel this way
And ever since the day you said goodbye
No one treats me like you used to do
I hope you're out and happy now
Doing up the town 'cause you know how
Every time I hear your name I want to die
And now I'm still feeling blue
And now I'm still feeling blueOh you are the one
You're the one in my heart
You're my darlin'
My life's greatest thrill
You are the one in my heart
And I know that I love you
And I always will
Well I've had some sweethearts
And dear, so have you
I know that I've done things
That I shouldn't do
We've both tasted life
Both the bitter and the sweet
It helped us to know love
When we chanced to meet
Oh you are the one
You're the one in my heart
You're my darlin'
My life's greatest thrill
You are the one in my heart
And I know that I love you
And I always will
We paid for our future with tears from the past
It helped us to know when we'd
Found love at last
I didn't know what joy was
Still actin' blue
I didn't know what love was till I met you[Chorus]
Stop the world and let me off
I'm tired of goin' 'round n' 'round
I played the game of love and lost
So, stop the world and let me off.
My dreams are shattered don't you see
Now you no longer care for me
I miss the wonder of your kiss
How could you leave me here like this?
[Chorus: x5]You told me that you'd love me until the end of time
But you are only human and humans change their minds
You left me without warning and the storm brought me pain
And down down down came the rain
All your love would bring a man so much happiness
That the heavens had to send the rain to divide it up I guess
I stumble through the darkness still calling your name
And down down down came the rain
All your love...You got a one horse ranch in Texas you got a mansion in Spain
You blew in on a Greyhound bus honey you flew in your own plane
You got drunk on whiskey seen you get tipsy on wine
We got a bad thing goin' it's just a bad thing goin'
We got a bad thing goin' but don't it feel fine
You sure are a high class lady you got a blue blood in your veins
You're a rose in the bright sunshine I'm a cowboy in the rain
We ain't got nothin' in common cept for a little time
We got a bad thing goin'...
You're a rodeo rattler and a midnight gambler you ain't never had a job
And I just found out your daddy owns a bank I was fixin' to rob
[ guitar ]
You got a one horse ranch in Texas...
Yeah we ain't got nothin' in common you know that girl you must have missed it
Be like ridin' in them barrel races and like sailin' them boatsI Need You To Want Me
Don Williams
Album: Flatlands
I don't need a fortune teller
I don't need me no M.D.
I don't need some slick suit that's passed the bar
I don't need a politician
Or some preacher on tv
Folks to tell me how I've done so far
I need you to want me
I want you to tove me
The way I love you:
Oh, for a friend
A friend you can count on
Be there for me and I'm yours till the end
Sagan's slingin' big bang
Nader's workin' on control
Einstein's Mr. Relativity
I don't need no revelation
Mystics cloud up things for me
And I don't need another mysteryI walk in on Friday nights
Same old bar, same burned out lights
Same people and all the same faces
So why in the hell does it feel like a different place?
Meet my friends for a girls' night out
Seems there ain't much to talk about
Same drinks that we're all raising
But all of the toasts just don't feel the same
We used to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you
They keep asking how I am
But they're really asking where you've been
I can read between all of the lines
It ain't just us missing all of the times
We were to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you
Ain't it funny how a flame like that
Oh whoa, when they think of you
It can burn when it's in the past
We used to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you
Oh, they think of you
When they think of me
Baby, baby, oh
When they think of me, they think of youWait a minute
Did I hear you say you're goin'
Far away again?
Try to change it
I can't take the lonely nights
Without your love
Doin' the road
Get the music done
And move along
What good does it do
To play your songs for her
And hear her say
Wait a minute
Did I hear you say you're goin'
Far away again?
Try to change it
I can't take the lonely nights
Without your love
You're rollin' along
Life's been good to you
An even so
She comes to you
Late at night
The time you hear her say
Once again...
Wait a minute
Did I hear you say you're goin'
Far away again?
Try to change it
I can't take the lonely nights
Without your love
Try to change it
I can't take the lonely nights
Without your loveTelephone to glory oh what joy devine

"Take me to a movie."
She's: "I can't find a thing to wear."
Now and then she's moody
She's a Saturn with a sunroof
With her brown hair a-blowing
She's a soft place to land
And a good feeling knowing
She's a warm conversation
That I wouldn't miss for nothing
She's a fighter when she's mad
And she's a lover when she's loving
And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her
I go on and on, and on
'Cause she's everything to me
She's a Saturday out on the town
And a church girl on Sunday
She's a cross around her neck
And a cuss word 'cause it's Monday
She's a bubble bath and candles
Baby, come and kiss me
She's a one glass of wine
And she's feeling kinda tipsy
She's the giver I wish I could be
And the stealer of the covers
She's a picture in my wallet
Of my unborn children's mother
She's the hand that I'm holding
When I'm on my knees and praying
She's the answer to my prayer
And she's the song that I'm playing
And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her
I go on and on, and on
'Cause she's everything to meShe looked so much like a lady, but she was so much like a child.
A devil when she held me close, an angel when she smiled.
She always held it deep inside, but somehow I always knew
She's go away when the grass turned green
And the sky turned baby blue.
And baby blue was the color of her eyes.
Baby blue like the Colorado skies.
Like a breath of spring, she came and left,
And I still don't know why,
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight.
She brought colors to my life that my eyes had never touched.
And when she taught me how to care, I never cared so much.
I try not to think of her, but I fall asleep and do,
And drift off where the grass is green and the sky is baby blue.
And baby blue was the color of her eyes.
Baby blue like the Colorado skies.
Like a breath of spring, she came and left,
And I still don't know why,
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight.Nobody knows it but I am so sad
Nobody knows it but I am so sad
And that is the saddest of all my girl
That is the saddest of all
We climbed the ladder to the top of my house
Never letting go of your hand
The sky trades the moon for the sun my girl
The sky trades the moon for the sun
And I gave to you my ugly brown coat
You made it pretty when you put it on
Warmth in the early morning chill my girl
Warmth in the early April
Then you said you? d trade the love of a man
Tears fell soft from your face to my hands
Said you? d trade your heart for mine my girl
I traded my heart for those days
And you made it clear it was strictly a deal
Of springtime love and that? s how I should feel
So I set the clock back an hour my girl
I set the time a just right
You see somewhere back there when I was boy
Furious I had become by the point
That men are just liars and thieves of sorts
Men are just liars and thieves
But I still believe and I stand by my words
I don? t know what you have seen or you? ve heard
But somebody? s lying to you my girl
Somebody? s lying to you
You really made me believe I could stay
Part with you actions in part what you said
But that was just foolish pride my girl
And those are only feelings inside
So I? m going back to the place where we met
I? m going to find the beer bottle we left
Wedged in the limbs of the tree that we sat in
Wedged in the magnolia tree
Well we hid for days like a proud pair of thieves
Too sure we were right too stubborn too leave
Wasted with the moment we lifted my girl
Stolen forever with youThere's a wreath on the door
She don't live here no more
As of today, she flew home
And we all gathered here
In sorrow and tears
It won't be the same with her gone
There's a place on the hill
That's peaceful and still
Where she'll sleep beside daddy again
The ole' family tree is shedding it's leaves
But we'll all met in heaven again
Chorus:
Oh, she's an angel
Let her fly, let her fly
She's gone home to glory
To her home in the sky
When God sees her comin'
Heaven's choir will smile
And sing, "oh she's an angel, let her fly, let her fly
Ooh, she's an angel, let her fly"
She used to rock me when I was a child
Sing "rock of ages" and "in the sweet bye and bye"
Her life wasn't easy, oh but how hard she tried
You know she's an angel, lord, so let her fly
Repeat chorus
Tag:
Let her fly
Ooh she's an angel, let her flyYou've been my best friend all these years
You've kept holding on to me
Through all the trials and tears
Only you and I could know all
The sacrifices that let this feeling grow
There were so many times we could've said goodbye
We could have called it quits but honey you and I
We're survivors we made it through the storm
When I've needed shelter
I've found it in your arms
Survivors in love enough
To fight together in this thing for life
There were times I lost my mind took
Some wrong turns you got me back in line
There were times you lost control
But I stood by you I loved you heart and soul
When faith was tested and dreams were fadin' fast
We held each other close until the rain have passed
We're survivors
A little time and tenderness has
Seen us through the years
We'll still be side by side when
The final smoke has cleared
We're survivors
Together in this thing for lifeHeart I'm ashamed of you lips I'm ashamed of you
You've betrayed me and you've made me love him and he's not free
Arms I'm ashamed of you aching the way you do
I'm ashamed of you but mostly I'm ashamed of me
Eyes you looked right past his wedding band and all you saw were lips you long to kiss
Fool you taught him into holding hands and now you're letting tear me up like this
Heart I'm ashamed of you
Mind you let him drive me out of you for you're made up to win his love somehow
Conscience ain't there something you can do cause if there is you'd better do it now
Heart I'm ashamed of youNine pound hammer is just a little too heavy
For my size, baby for my size
Take this hammer show it to my captain
Tell him I'm gone, baby tell him I'm
If he asks you where I went to
Tell him you don't know, baby you don't know
Ain't no hammer in this mountain
Out rings mine, baby out rings mine
Take this hammer and throw it in the river
It rings right on, baby it rings right on
This is the hammer that killed John Henry
But it won't kill me, baby it won't kill me
This old hammer killed my buddy
It laid him low, it laid him low
Roll on buddy don't roll so slow
How can I roll when the wheels won't go
Roll on buddy for to make your time
I broke down and I can't make mine
This nine pound hammer just a little too heavy
For my size, baby for my sizeI haven't finished a thing since I started my life
I don't feel much like starting now
Walking down lonely has worked like a charm
I'm the only one I have to let down
But watching you makes me think that that is wrong
I can go on with my insecure nature
I can keep living off sympathy
I can tell all the people that all of the success
Is a direct reflection on me
But watching you makes me think that that is wrong
What is important
What's really important
Am I not to know by my name
Will I ever know silence without mental violence
With a ringing that might go away
It's up to you my father called on me
I haven't finished a thing since I started my life
I don't feel much like starting now
I haven't finished a thing since I started my life
I don't feel much like starting now
I haven't finished a thing since I started my life
I don't feel much like starting now
I haven't finished a thing since I started my life
I don't feel much like starting now
I haven't finished a thing since I started my life
I haven't finished a thing since I started my lifeRaymond's in his Sunday best
He's usually up to his chest in oil and grease
There's the martins walking in
With that mean little freckle-faced kid
Who broke a window last week
Sweet miss Betty likes to sing off key
In the pew behind me
That's what I love about Sunday
Sing along as the choir sways
Every verse of amazing grace
And then we shake the preacher's hand
Go home into your blue jeans
Have some chicken and some baked beans
Pick a backyard football team
Not do much of anything
That's what I love about Sunday
I stroll to the end of the drive
Pick up the Sunday times, grab a coffee cup
Looks like sally and rob finally tied the knot
Well, it's about time
It's thirty-five cents off a ground round
Baby, cut that coupon out
That's what I love about Sunday
Cat-nappin' on a porch swing
You curled up next to me
The smell of jasmine wakes us up
Take a walk down a back road
Tackle box and a cane pole
Carve our names in that white oak
Steal a kiss as the sun fades
That's what I love about Sunday
New believers getting baptized
Mama's hands raised up high
Havin' a hallelujah good time
A smile on everybody's face
That's what I love about Sunday
That's what I love about SundayBaby girl I'm caught up in your heatwave
You're not like the end of June
It's not like you're gonna cool off soon
The spotlight looks good on you
It looks good on you
Shadows heat you like a headdress
Key to my heart on your necklace
Between summer girl and that sundress
I'm sweatin' and I'm reckless
Moon dance in the starlight
Got two hands on your hips tonight
It's hot as hell but it's just right
Let me drive a double shot on your cruisin' light
Midnight sweat, jerky skin
Can't cool off on a cold even
Love this love we're makin' baby even if it's rainin'
Talk about a heatwave
Watch your body move to the beat babe
Feels like we're havin' us a beach day
Lightin' it up while your feet sway
I'm caught up in your heatwave
Heatwave (girl so fine)
Heatwave (girl so fine)
Baby girl I'm caught up in your
Two piece in the water
That's all me, I got her
There's gonna be some lightenin' at the bottom of this bottle
We have drawn our names in the white sand
Call it what it is, I'm the right man
Meltin' ice in your right hand
But I'ma put a rock on your left baby
Moon dance in the starlight
Got two hands on your hips tonight
It's hot as hell but it's just right
Let me drive a double shot on your cruisin' light
Midnight sweat, jerky skin
Can't cool off on a cold even
Love this love we're makin' baby even if it's rainin'
Talk about a heatwave
Burnin' up, baby you've got me burnin' up
You're so south just turn it up
Love it any way you serve it up, serve it up
Burnin' up, baby you've got me burnin' up
You're so south just turn it up
Love it any way you serve it up
Serve it up
Moon dance in the starlight
Got two hands on your hips tonight
It's hot as hell but it's just right
Let me drive a double shot on your cruisin' light
Midnight sweat, jerky skin
Can't cool off on a cold even
Love this love we're makin' baby even if it's rainin'
Talk about a heatwave (burnin' up)
Baby you've got me burnin' up
You're so south just turn it up
Love it any way you serve it up serve it up
Burnin' up, baby you've got me burnin' up
You're so south just turn it up
Love it any way you serve it up, serve it up
Baby girl I'm caught up in yourConestoga
I have wandered through the hills of better days
Broken my own heart with my cheatin ways
So Ill try to make amends I will rectify
All the time I spent more dead than alive
Darlin hitch up the Conestoga
Ride my gently to & fro
I have searched many a lifetime
All for what I do not know
All for what I know
Give me freedom like the flight of a ravens wing
Lie down with the sun, rise and start to sing
Lonesome doves will always find their way back home
But theres seed to feed anywhere we roam
I will take the reins when you need to sleep
I will soothe your pain if your back grows weat
But first these words you must speak
I am ready to go, Im ready to go
Darlin pack up the Conestoga
Ride my gently sweet and low
I have searched many a lifetime
All for what I do not know
All for what I know
Ready to goready to goWe know it's wrong to let this fire burn between us
We've got to stop this wild desire in you and in me
So, we'll let the flame burn once again until the thrill is gone
Then we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning
We're two people caught up in the flame that has to die out soon
I didn't mean to start this fire and neither did you
So, tonight when you hold me tight we'll let the fire burn on
And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning
Each time when we meet we both agree that it's for the last time
But out of your arms, I'm out of my mind
So, we'll taste the thrill of stolen love tonight until the dawning
And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning
We're two people caught up in the flame that has to die out soon
I didn't mean to start this fire and neither did you
So, tonight when you hold me tight we'll let the fire burn on
And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morningI've had nothing but sorrow
Since you said we were through
There's no hope for tomorrow
How's the world treating you?
Every sweet thing that mattered
Has been broken in two
All my dreams have been shattered
How's the world treating you?
Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day you're away
Though our pathways have parted
To your memory I'm true
Guess I'll stay broken-hearted
How's the world treating you ?
Are you turning and yearning
Do you ever get through
Do you think of returning
How's the world treating you ?
Every sweet thing that mattered
How's the world treating you?
And IÃÂ¢??m asking you darling
How's the world treating you?If I wake up in the morning when I look outside it's storming
And it seems the world is covered by clouds of grey
I don't really mind the weather baby long as we're together
In my heart it's a gonna be a sunshiny day
I don't ever pay attention about the weatherman may mention
I don't even care about what he's got to say
I surely care now if it showers when you got a love like ours
Every day is a gonna be a sunshiny day
And I'll have a sunshine day every day that I live
The sweet love that you give will make it shine
And I'll I have a sunshiny day in my heart from now on just as long as you are mine
So let the howlin' wind start blowin' let the raindrops keep on flowin'
Everytime they touch my face just kiss them away
Even with the clouds above me long as I've got you to love me
Every day is a gonna be a sunshiny day
And I'll have a sunshiny day...
So let the howlin' wind start blowin' let the raindrops keep on flowin'
Every day is a gonna be a sunshiny day yes every day is a gonna be a sunshiny dayOnly you, can make my dreams come true
Only you, can turn my skies to blue
Love like ours, should not be far apart
Only you, can break my heart
[Instrumental]
Only you, can end these sleepless nights
Only you, can make things turn out right
You and you alone, can keep us far apart
Only you, can break my heart.
Only you can break my heart...The years will see us together as they quickly pass away
Our hair'll make it lighter but our love will burn brighter
In our hearts we'll never change
We'll say that all our mem'ries of every passing day
Time may rearrange us but we know it won't change us
In our hearts we'll never change
Time may change the way we look but not the way we feel
We'll say that all our mem'ries...
In our hearts we'll never changeI was on the rebound from a broken love affair
When I first thought of glimps of her in you
And though you never measured up to what she meant to me
I couldn't find the words to tell you so
Cause I'm not strong enough to leave you and too weak to let you go
You give me precious love to hold on to
But somehow deep inside I've got a feeling that you know
I'm not strong enough to leave you and too weak to let you go
[ steel ]
Never once did you hold back the love you had for me
I guess you thought my love for you would grow
But women have a funny way of seeing through a man
But if you knew you never told me so
Cause I'm not strong enough...
No I'm not strong enough to leave you and too weak to let you goIf you're coming with me you need
nerves of steel
'Cause I take corners on two wheels
It's a never-ending circus ride
The faint of heart need not apply
Chorus:
Mi vida loca over and over
Destiny turns on a dime
I go where the wind blows
You can't tame a wild rose
Welcome to my crazy life
Sweetheart before this night is through
I could fall in love with you
Come dancing on the edge with me
Let my passion set you free
Chorus
Here in the firelight I see your tattoo
Mi vida loco, so you're crazy too
Chorus
We'll go where the wind blows
And I'll be a wild rose
Welcome to my crazy lifeRed lips, blue eyes and little white lies
Oh darlin' I'm a fool for you
Hey darlin' why can't you can be true
Red lips, blue eyes and sweet disguise
Oh darlin' the things you put me through
Your little white lies are breaking my heart in two
You come around and tell me that you love me so
You take a little loving then you say you gotta go
I know he's waiting for you on the other side of town
Well I'm a fool to love you baby 'cause I know you're messing around
Red lips, blue eyes and little white lies
Oh darlin' why can't you be true
I'm crazy to love you baby you know I do, yeah
Sooner or later you'll have to face the truth
Little white lies will catch up with you
With nowhere to run and no where to hide
And no one to love you there by your side
Red lips, blue eyes and little white lies
Oh darlin' the things you put me through
But your little white lies are gonna catch up with you
Oh your little white lies are gonna catch up with you
Baby your little white lies are gonna catch up with youTake the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care who's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be aloneI'd like to live out all my dreams and if I could
Yes, if I could, the nicest one would be with you
And you'd be here with me, don't you ever get lonely?
Lord, I'm no good when you're away
What do expect from a girl, who loves you, like I love you?
Won't you ever just get tired and come on home to me?
Don't you ever get lonely?
You're a part of me that I can't do without
You're a part of me, what dreams are all about
But you can't hold onto somethin' that you never had before
Love waits for the wind to bring you back again
And take me away, take me away
Friends say it's great now, you're a star
But what did they expect from a girl, who loved you just the way you were?
And late at night, how I wish things had never changed
When you were here with me, don't you ever get lonely?
You're a part of me that I can't do without
You're a part of me, what dreams are all about
But you can't hold onto somethin' that you never had before
Love waits for the wind to bring you back again
And take me away, take me away
You're a part of me that I can't do without
You're a part of me, what dreams are all about
But you can't hold onto somethin' that you never had before
Love waits for the wind to bring you back again
And take me away, take me away
Take me awayDon't look so sad I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that were burning
Lay your head upon my pillow hold your warm tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowin' soft against the window
And make believe you love me just one more time for the good times
I'll get along you'll find another and I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
Lay your head upon my pillow hold your warm tender body close to mine
Listen hear the whisper of the raindrops blowin' soft against the window
Tell me that you love me just one more time make believe for the good timesI've been bound to leave you,
We've known that for a while.
I'm sure it's something I can't do,
If I can't leave you with a smile.
I don't know how far I'll have to go
Til I'm sure those eyes won't cry.
And in my mind, I've left enough to know
That I can't leave you with a bad goodbye.
Goodbye
Easier said than done.
Goodbye
There's no good when your the one
Whose goodbye you swore would never come.
And in my goodbye you're finding none.
I'm still bound to leave you,
I surely don't know how.
My heart won't let me put you through
What my mind says should happen now.
I don't know where we'll go from here,
There may be no way to fly.
And the cloud I'm in just makes it all to clear
That I can't leave you with a bad goodbye.
Goodbye
Easier said than done.
Goodbye
There's no good when your the one
Whose goodbye you swore would never come.
And in my goodbye you're finding none.
How can we be so far between
Where we are and one more try?
And any way I look, I've only seen
That I can't leave you with a bad
GoodbyeI was a new kid on the circuit
Gold buckles in my eyes
But the horse I drew was plenty rank
Much to my surprise
I did a double back flip
And landed on my head
This old cowboy limped out in the arena
Leaned over me and said
You gotta cowboy up
When you get throwed down
Get right back in the saddle
As soon as you hit the ground
You heard that the tough get goin'
When the goin' gets tough
Around here what we say is
Boy you better cowboy up
By the end of my last season
They said I was among the best
So I proudly called a girl back home
Hopin' she would be impressed
But her momma said she married a guy
That I used to call my friend
But before the first tear could fall
These words came back again
You gotta cowboy up
When you get throwed down
You get right back in the saddle
As soon as you hit the ground
You heard that the tough get goin'
When the goin' gets tough
Around here what we say is
Boy you better cowboy up
Well its not an easy lesson
To learn in life and love
But its the only way to go
Whenever you bite the dust
You gotta cowboy up
When you get throwed down
Get right back in the saddle
As soon as you hit the ground
You heard that the tough get goin'
When the goin' gets tough
Around here what we say is
Boy you better cowboy up
Around here what we say is
Boy you better cowboy upI DREAMED MY BABY CAME HOME

WITH MELBA MONTGOMERY
I went to sleep last night lonely and blue
Tears were falling like the morning dew
But when I closed my eyes my loneliness was gone
Cause I dreamed my baby came home
And you were holding me kissing me like you used to do
My heart went crazy when you whispered I love you
Yes you were standing there sweet as you could be
Like you had never said goodbye to me
For just a little while my loneliness was gone
Cause I dreamed my baby came home
I went to sleep last night lonely and blue...
And you were holding me...
Yes you were standing there...Well me and Bobby Ray was goin down to a pickup joint just outside of town,
You know a metting market, where you pick up chicks
Well knowing Bobby Ray as I do, He'll be goin home alone before the night is through,
He's just too darn picky, he's always wantin to score big!
Well I'm not leavin here alone, I'm gonna compromise, early on,
Yea, I'm goin ugly early tonight,
She may not be a beauty queen but that's alright,
I'm not waitin round for one that looks good in the light,
I'm goin ugly early tonight
So Bobby I says,
Please don't stare, but check them 2 out standin over there,
He says you mean the good lookin blonde and the one with the big zits?
I says, Yea that's right and here's my plan, I'm not goin for miss scandinavian, Her chubby lil friend...well that's my pick
You can drink them cute but not skinny,
You get too picky, you ain't gettin any
So I'm goin ugly early tonight,
She may not be a beauty queen but that's alright,
I'm not waitin round for on who looks good in the light,
I'm goin ugly early tonight.
Then all of a sudden to my surprise, the pretty one was givin me the eye,
And I was fixin to move up from a 2 to a 10!
She said, you know I don't live to far from here,
I'll get my purse and you pay for them beers,
And I was feelin pretty puffed up til she turned to her friend.
I guess she didn't I'd here,
Them hurtful words she whispered in little chubby's ear,
Yea I'm goin ugly early tonight,
His friend is better lookin but I ain't got the time,
I'm not waitin round for one that looks good in the light,
She said I'm goin ugly early tonight.
You know she really hurt my pride but way down deep inside
I'm glad she's goin ugly tonight!Her hair was as black as pike county cold
And her lips were as red as blood on the snow
She wore short vinyl skirts and them boots to her knees
And she lived in the holler across the mountain from me
Hard Candy so sweet
And I could never get enough
Hard Candy so easy
For me to love
Wild horses couldn't keep her old man outta jail
From bootlegging whiskey his sons helped him sell
And growing up in that holler wasn't nothing but hot
Fightin' roosters and Kerr dogs tied up in the yard
Hard Candy so sweet
And I could never get enough
Hard Candy so easy
For me to love
One night on the mountain back in the pine trees
Candy let down her guard, she said she loved me
We left the holler when her old man got put back in jail
And she told all her brothers to go straight to Hell
Hard Candy so sweet
And I could never get enough
Hard Candy so easy
For me to loveVerse 1:
Rolled in as wild and free
As a clear water beach at seventeen memory
Eyes blue as the July sky
Sent shivers down my spine
Everytime that he smiled at me
Pre-Chorus:
The way he took off that white t-shirt
The way he looked walking out of that water
And it just got hotter,and hotter
Chorus:
The tan line's fading on my sun kissed skin
Hits me like a wave when I think about it
Sublime on the boom box
Our bare feet in the sand
Makin' out on the boardwalk
My heart on fire in his hands
He drove away the first of September
But I remember
Yeah I remember
He talked like
And he walked like
And he looked like
And he burned like summer,summer oh
He burned like summer,summer oh
Verse 2:
His kiss was a sweet salt breeze
Had a hold on me like the moon pulls the tide
Took me up in the Ferris wheel
And I swear it feels like I never came down from the high
Pre-Chorus:
I know we never said forever
But something about it felt like it would never end
Chorus:
The tan line's fading on my sun kissed skin
Hits me like a wave when I think about it
Sublime on the boom box
Our bare feet in the sand
Makin' out on the boardwalk
My heart on fire in his hands
He drove away the first of September
But I remember
Yeah I remember
He talked like
And he walked like
And he looked like
And he burned like summer,summer oh
Bottle rocket sparks in the Florida sky
Summer summer
Something that bright's gotta burn out sometime
Chorus:
The tan line's fading on my sun kissed skin
Hits me like a wave when I think about it
Sublime on the boom box
Our bare feet in the sand
Makin' out on the boardwalk
My heart on fire in his hands
He drove away the first of September
But I remember
Yeah I remember
He talked like
And he walked like
And he looked like
And he burned like summer,summer oh
Yeah
He burned like summer, summer
He burned like summer(To be alone) to be alone (with just a memory) with just a memory
This is my destiny to be alone
(You left me here) you left me here
(With just these walls to see) with just these walls to see
I know you meant for me to be alone
You left me to be alone but there's one thing that you didn't count on
Something far beyond your imagination
I knelt and I prayed and I recieved a much much deeper consolation
And now I share a greater love you see it's not so bad for me to be alone
With my head bowed down on my knees I prayed and I cried
And He dried my tears and He promised me that He'd forever be at my side
He'll be my friend beyond eternity it dasn't worry me to be aloneA calloused right hand
Holds a shiny gold watch
For thirty rears spent on the clock
But you won't see no tears
From this working class hero
He's always been hard as a rock
But he knows he's too old
To really start over
Besides he just wouldn't know how
I guess he's just glad
That he's not alone
But he's got to wonder what now
There's no hall of fame for that working class hero
No statues carved out of stone
And his greatest reward is the love of a woman
And his children
So after he's gone
That old working class hero lives on
Well that three-bedroom house
He build in the '50s
Seems so much bigger today
With just him and mama
And not many bills
'Cause all of the kids moved away
What he's done with his life
Might not be remembered
But he's got every right to be proud
'Cause the blood sweatin' years
Of this workin' class hero
Is really what livin's about
'Cause there's no hall of fame for that working class hero
No statues carved out of stone
And his greatest reward is the love of a worman
And his children
So after he's gone
That old working class hero lives on
Yea, that working class hero lives onNeither one of us got too much sleep
Now I'm running on fumes and kisses and
This smile on my face that'll last all week
I can't quit thinking bout you
Last night, no, it didn't stop with the sunshine
I find myself sitting at a green light with my mind
And that song playing
Got me dreaming in the day
Dreaming in the day
Slow-burnin' candles and talkin' sweet
Losing track of time but it don't stop tickin'
Like I'm floating on a cloud a little south of Heaven
I ain't ever comin' down
Last night, no, it didn't stop with the sunshine
I find myself sitting at a green light with my mind
And that song playing
Got me dreaming in the day
Dreaming in the day
Last night, no, it didn't stop with the sunshine
I find myself sitting at a green light with my mind
And that song playing
Last night, no, it didn't stop with the sunshine
I find myself sittin at a green light with my mind
And that song playing
Got me dreaming in the day
Dreaming in the day
Dreaming in the day
Dreaming in the dayWhen you say love you're telling everyone your moment's come
And you've found out what you've been looking for
When you say love you've said the only word that tells the world
You never will be lonely anymore
You've got a pretty rainbow of your own
And at last you've found your pot of gold
You're completely satisfied a feeling of contentment fills your soul
When you say love it means you've found your special one
And that you care enough to give your very best
When you say love there's not another word that says so much
But that four-letter word means happiness
Your heart has given wings to touch the sky
Much higher than the eagle dares to fly
If you took everything you've heard and tried to make a magic word
You'll find you've said it all when you say love
When you say love it means you've found your special one...
When you say loveThere's a long line of mourners driving down our little street
Their fancy cars are such a sight to see
They're all of your rich friends that knew you in the city
And now they finally brought you on to me
When you left you told me someday you'd be returnin'
In a fancy car for all the town to see
Now everybody's watching you finally got your dream
You're riding in a long black limousine
The papers told of how you lost your life
The party and the fatal crash that night
The race upon the highway the curve you didn't see
And now you're in that long black limousine
Through tear dimmed eyes I watch as you ride by
A chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine
I'll never love another my heart and all my dreams
Are with you in that long black limousineDo you think of the cross on which Jesus died
Of the blood he shed for you?
Are you prepared to meet him in that land of love
By his word, are you going to abide?
Remember the cross on which Jesus died
Follow in his footsteps each day
He shed his blood for you and he shed his blood for me
Never cast that cross aside
Never let other people lead you astray
Teach his words to them if you can
They must think of the cross on which Jesus died
And get ready to meet him someday
Remember the cross on which Jesus died
Follow in his footsteps each day
He shed his blood for you and he shed his blood for me
Never cast that cross aside
When Jesus comes down from heaven above
And you haven't thought of that cross
He'll cast you aside in the twinkling of an eye
And you won't see his blessed home of love
Remember the cross on which Jesus died
Follow in his footsteps each day
He shed his blood for you and he shed his blood for me
Never cast that cross asideYes, the roof leaks and the bed she squeak
And the rent is due in just two more weeks
Now I just want to go back to sleep
Tomorrow is another day
Oh, the palm trees sway to and fro
I think I'll just sit and watch the coconuts grow
It's hard to get high when your feeling so low
And tomorrow is another day
Well, the mainsail broke on my fishing boat
And it's almost time for my rum and Coke
I'll fix it as soon as I have a smoke
Tomorrow is another day, yeah
So you go at night with your lantern bright
And you sit on the bridge and you get half tight
Ah, tonight you can't get the fish to bite
But tomorrow's another day, yeah, yeahA year and a half, did not seem like much time.
But its almost forever, when you're only nine.
Yes, she still adores him, and tears fill her eyes.
As she clings to her pillow, and cries.
Daddy come home oh please, Daddy come home.
Sweet Daddy, Are you out there somewhere all alone?
Was Mommy mean to you, Did I treat you wrong?
Daddy, Oh Daddy come home.
Down on the coast, in a honeymoon sweet.
Someones tossing and turning, and trying to sleep.
Was that just the wind, in the pines 'cross the bay?
Or the small voice, from so far away.
Daddy come home, oh please, Daddy come home.
Sweet Daddy, Are you out there somewhere all alone?
Was Mommy mean to you, Did I treat you wrong?
Daddy, Oh Daddy, come home.Day one
I stumbled through hello on Fifth Avenue

We grabbed a bite to eat and talked all afternoon
Caught a movie on day fourteen
And day sixty seven she said I love you to me
Oh what a feeling
What a wonderful emotion
Yeah what a life
Counting my blessings and knowing
Ooh we had our ups and downs
All along the way
She had a chance to leave but chose to stay
What a beautiful day
What a beautiful day
Day one sixteen
I asked her what she was doing for the rest of my life
Day one eighty nine
Oh I almost lost that girl to my foolish pride
But she said I do on day four eighty two
And gave me a son on day seven sixty one
Oh what a feeling
What a wonderful emotion
Yeah what a life
Counting my blessings and knowing

Ooh we had our ups and downs
All along the way
She had a chance to leave but chose to stay
What a beautiful day
What a beautiful day
Day one I thank God I said hello on Fifth AvenueI can't see nothing but spotlights spotlights see nothing but me
All of my music is lonely yeah all of my heartaches were free
Don't waste your time or your flash bulbs too many heroes are dead
You like to live in the city yeah I like to live in my head
Somebody shoot out that spotlight spotlights ain't nothing but jive
Roll me a smoke and give me some coke treat me like I am alive
Tell all the ladies I'm single tell Lone Star beer that I'm dry
Everyone's lying bout livin' everyone's livin' a lie
I spend my nighttime's in mourning I spend my morning's alone
You spent your your money to see me tonight yeah I spent all mine gettin' stoned
Now that they're both kinda busted doesn't it seem kinda strange
That I lay down knowing we're two of a kind you'll leave here knowing my name
Somebody shoot out that spotlight spotlights ain't nothing but jive
Roll me a smoke and give me some coke treat me like I am alive
Tell all the ladies I'm single tell Lone Star beer that I'm dry
Everyone's lying bout livin' everyone's livin' a lieIt's been a long time 'comin
But I'm finally on my way
14 years at Edyville's a might price to pay
Once your week away from home's turned into all these years
One regret, One broken heart was taunted into tears.
Mississippi River let your waters flow
Carry me down to the Gulf of Mexico
Louisiana 'bihue in the mornin' sun
Smell the sweet Magnolia
When the day is done.
Oh rivers when I look at you
I think of time I've lost
Sittin' in a dirty cell I've had to pay the cost
For a life of crime I chose a prize I can not win
When I get to Louisiana I'll never leave again.
Mississippi River let your waters flow

Mississippi River (Mississippi River) ((Mississippi River)) (((Mississippi River)))Turn out the lights and close the door
Put your head on the pillow
Let me keep you warm
I want to run my hands across your face
Lyin' beside you is still the perfect place
We're still going strong
So glad that you came along
Babe in every way
You're still beautiful to me
I just have to say
You're still beautiful to me
Lay back baby and close your eyes
Let me do everything your heart desires
When I think of the years making love to you
There still ain't nothing that I'd rather do
There's something I can't deny
You sure know how to move this guy
Babe in every way
You're still beautiful to me
I just have to say
You're still beautiful to me
(And it still feels good)
It still feels good
It still runs deep
When you get close, babe
I still get weak
"Cause in these arms is where you belong
We're still going strong
So glad that you came along
Hey babe, you're still number one
Baby can't you see
You're still beautiful to me
You'll always be so beautiful to me(Dolly Parton)
When you're not strong and need someone to lean on
Let me be your strength when you're weak
When you need somebody to comfort and love you
Let mine be the arms that you seek
I want to be what you need
Whatever it is, come to me
You'll always know where I'll be
'Cause I want to be what you need
When life gets to be more than you can endure
My hand is always in reach
And I'm always waiting, and I'm always willing
To give you whatever you need
I want to be what you need
Whatever it is, come to me
You'll always know where I'll be
'Cause I want to be what you need
Yes, I want to be what you needHmm (oh ain't he cute)
Ah well I don't like to get up if I feel like sleeping
No and I don't like to sweep my floor if I don't feel like sweeping
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
I've been this way too long and you can't ever change me now
Don't waste your time in tryin' cause I am just what I am
I've got my way of doin' things and who can say I'm wrong
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
Oh and I don't like to make my bed if I don't feel like makin' it
No and I don't like to bake no bread if I don't feel like bakin' it
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
Cause you can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
Well I don't like to hoe no corn if I don't feel like hoein' it
(You should you're corny)
And I don't like to mow no grass if I don't feel like mowin' it
(I know it's comin' through the upstairs window)
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
If you don't like the way I am...
Oh as far as I can remember back you have been this way
(And as long as you remember I will be honey)
When you was in the first grade you was exact the same way
(First grade I was waitin' for the second)
You swiped the pencils and scattered paper all over the desk
(Oh that's real cute you're makin' up stuff)Play Music !
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!
Christ, the Saviour is born
Christ, the Saviour is born
Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birthWomen get lonely when they are only
Waiting to share the night, wanting to share their lives
Make-believe lovers can't warm the covers
Needing a game to play and dreaming their nights away
Maybe tomorrow, he'll come along
And take you into his arms, where you belong
'Cause women get lonely when they are only
Waiting to share the night, wanting to share their lives
Women get lonely
Maybe tomorrow, he'll come along
And take you into his arms, where you belong
'Cause women get lonely when they are only
Waiting to share the night, wanting to share their lives
Women get lonely, women get lonelyI didn't see no sense in me just sittin' here and draggin' out the pain
There's nothin' you can say or do to ever make me want for you again
You say I've turned my back on you I'm runnin' out but baby that's a lie
It just don't take me long to say goodbye
I told you when I met you not to put your chain of love on me too tight
Or you'd look up and find me slipping out into the freedom of the night
I didn't mean to hurt you babe I think you know I ain't that kinda guy
But it just don't take me long to say goodbye
It just don't take me long to change my shirt and call a cab and catch a train
There ain't nothing we can talk about and baby I've got nothing to explain
All I'm taking is my body so don't ever say I left you high and dry
It just don't take me long to say goodbye it just don't take me long to say goodbyeAll the places we used to go all the things we used to do
All the things are in the past out after losing you
Now my life's just one big heartache and my world is turning blue
I gotta hurt I can't get over after losing you
I go to the places we used to go
Just hoping to get a glimpse of you
And every time I see you with your new love
It hurts me and breaks my heart in two
I thought no one could come between us
For you said you love me true
You've put me down I went to pieces after losing you
You've put me down I went to pieces after losing youYou know that after the laughter comes the tears
That's what happens when your memory appears
I try to act real happy since you said goodbye
But sometimes when I least expect I break right down and cry
Cause always after the laughter comes the tears
And my feelings never seem to be too clear
I never know how long I'll smile but it's usually just for a little while
Cause after the laughter comes the tears
After the laughter comes the tears...I've been watchin' you watchin' every girl in the bar
And payin' no attention to the one on your arm
You're a dog
And man, she's smokin'
I've seen your kind before
You think you're so cool
This country boy's gunna take you to school
Hold out your hand, no man..i ain't jokin'
[Chorus]
Hold my beer
While I kiss your girlfriend
Cause she needs a real man, not a boy like you.
Hold my beer
Ya, I'm a man on a mission
You don't see what you're missin'
But I do
So here, hold my beer
Well friend I wouldn't blame me if you wanted to fight,
If you wanna later we can take it outside
But now, do me a favor
[Chorus]
Well guys like you,
You ain't good for nothing
Well hold on a second,
You gotta be good for something (something)
I know
Hold my beer
While I kiss your girlfriend
Cause she needs a real man,
Not a chump like you
Hold my beer
I'm a man on a mission
You don't see what you're missin'
But I do
So here, hold my beer
Hold my beerYes I keep singin' a song about love hummin' a tune about happiness
Winkin' my eye at the sun up above and just singin' a song about love
I don't have no acts to drive no bridges to be burned
There's better ways to go through life and the best way I have learned
Whenever troubles cross my mind I think about your love
And then a smile upon my face just shows what I'm thinking of
And I start singin' a song..
[ guitar ]
When other people talk to me they just don't understand
Just what it is that's happen now that made me a happy man
It's not a fortune I have found it's something you can't see
It isn't gold it's just a love between my woman and me
So I keep singin' a song...
So I keep singin' a song...I sell the morning papers sir my name is Jimmy Brown
Everybody knows that I'm the newsboy of the town
You can hear me yellin' Morning Star runnin' along the street
Got no hat upon my head no shoes upon my feet
[ ac.guitar ]
Never mind sir how I look don't look at me and frown
Sell the morning papers sir my name is Jimmy Brown
I'm awful cold and hungry sir my clothes is mighty thin
Wander bout from place to place my daily bread to win
[ ac.guitar ]
My father died a drunkard sir I've heard my mother say
I am helpin' mother sir as I journey on my way
My mother always tells me sir I've nothing in the world to lose
I'll get a place in heaven sir to sell the Gospel News
[ ac.guitar ]
I sell the morning papers sir...Bye bye love bye bye happiness hello loneliness I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye love bye bye sweet caress hello emptiness I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye
There goes my baby with someone new he sure feel happy I sure look blue
He was my baby till she walked in goodbye to romance that might have been
Bye bye love
I'm through with romance I'm through with love
I'm through with counting the stars above
I guess the reason why I'm so free is both my babies walked out on me
Bye bye love
Bye bye my love goodbye bye bye my love goodbye bye bye my love goodbyeDon't tell him that I'm still crying
Don't let him know that losin' him was more than I could stand
I'm glad you hear that both of them are happy
I hope he's finally found what he never found with me
Tell him that you saw me and be sure to say hello
But promise me one thing before you go
Don't tell him that I'm still crying
Don't let him know that there's no way my broken heart can mend
Don't tell him that I'm still crying
Don't let him know that losin' him was more than I could stand
Don't tell him that I'm still crying...Caught, in a camera's eye
Caught, without an alibi
A picture's worth a thousand words they say
We're caught in a motel room
The tangled sheets smell like sweet perfume
No matter who's at fault, we're caught
Now who'd have thought it'd end like this
The after glow's such a painfull bliss
What a web we weave when we practice to deceive
We played the game but now we lose
Now we're just back street news
Oh my God, what are we gonna do
We're caught, in a camera's eye
Caught, without an alibi
A picture's worth a thousand words they say
We're caught in a motel room
The tangled sheets smell like sweet perfume
No matter who's at fault, we're caught
Rumors spread like wildfire in this town
It's too late to change our fate
We'll never live it down
Caught, in a camera's eye
Caught, without an alibi
A picture's worth a thousand words they say
We're caught in a motel room
The tangled sheets smell like sweet perfume
No matter who's at fault, we're caughtTouch me, tell me what you want me to do
I want to take a little trip around you
You set me on fire
Ohh, you set me on fire
Lock me up inside of this room
I just wanna be close to you
I can't take it anymore
Baby, I want you so much
I wanna feel your breath on my skin
To find that place we've never been
I wanna spend all night tangled up in your love
Kiss me, kiss me till the sun comes up
Slow, sweet, I can never get enough of your love
You're taking me higher
Ohh, you're taking me higher
Yeah, lock me up inside of this room
I just wanna be close to you
I can't take it anymore
Baby, I want you so much
I wanna feel your breath on my skin
To find that place we've never been
I wanna spend all night tangled up in your love, yeah
Yeah, lock me up inside of this room
I just wanna be close to you
I can't take it anymore
Baby, I want you so much
I wanna feel your breath on my skin
To find that place we've never been
I wanna spend all night tangled up in your love
Tangled up in your love
Tangled up in your love
Tangled up in your bed
Tangled up in your sheets
Tangled up in your head
Tangled up in your love
Tangled up in your love, yeahI never made it back to Boston
I've always been a rambling man
But by the time I got to Phoenix
She didn't quite fit in my plans
I lost my heart in San Francisco
And found it in the streets of Baltimore
There must be someone wanting true love
Could it be you?
Hey vie got so much inside me to give
What can I do?
It seemed that Rachel's wings got colder
She finally crossed loves cheating line
She fell for some young Dallas cowboy
Hey, I never saw the danger signsC'mon
A click clacking my heart keeps making an ominous sound
That chain keeps dragging me up just to drop me back down
I think I'm over the hump enough to see the other side
That's when another thought of you runs through my mind
Since you had to go
I've been on a roller coaster ride
Up and down I go
Over you, about to lose my mind
It's out of control
Round and round, upside down and down upside
Since you had to go
I've been on a roller coaster ride
Psychedelic trip, my stomach flips again and again
I'd love to get my ticket back but I'm locked in
A white knuckle grip hanging onto what's left of my life
I hate to think about to coming down when I'm up this high
Since you had to go
I've been on a roller coaster ride
Up and down I go
Over you, about to lose my mind
Pain points his gun
And I hold my hands up high
Off the edge I go
On this roller coaster ride
Hang on
Since you had to go
I've been on a roller coaster ride
Up and down I go
Over you, about to lose my mind
It's out of control
Round and round,
Upside down and down upside
Since you had to go
I've been on a roller coaster rideTake me in the lifeboat, take me in the lifeboat
It will stand the raging storm
Take me in the lifeboat, take me in the lifeboat
It will bear my spirit home
Now, come brothers and sisters and don't fall asleep
But pray night and day or you'll sink in the deep
Fathers and mothers are praying so loud
Saying Lord won't you take us in your lifeboat?
Take me in the lifeboat, take me in the lifeboat
It will stand the raging storm
Take me in the lifeboat, take me in the lifeboat
It will bear my spirit home
The clouds are so heavy, the winds are so loud
The thunders are rolling, bursting the clouds
They prayed to their ship mates for what they had done
They took the dying Savior in their lifeboatIf the wife and I are fussin' brother that's our right
Cause me and that sweet woman's got a license to fight
Why don't you mind your own business mind your own business
Cause if you mind your own business then you won't be mindin' mine
Oh the woman on our party line's a nosey thing
She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring
Why don't you mind your own business mind your own busines
Cause if you mind your own business then you won't be mindin' mine
[ guitar ]
I got a little gal that wears her hair up high the boys all whistle when she walks by
Why don't you mind your own business mind your own business
Well if you mind your own business then you sure won't be mindin' mine
If I want to honky tonk around the two or three
Brother that's my headache don't you worry bout me
Just you mind your own business mind your own business
If you mind your own business then you won't be mindin' mine
[ steel ]
Mindin' other people's business seems to be hightone
I got all that I can do just mind my own
Why don't you mind your own business mind your own business
If you mind your own business you'll stay busy all the timeMaking believe that you still love me and it's leaving me alone and so blue
I'll always dream still I'll never own you making believe is all I can do
I can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love and you'll never be mine
Making believe I'll spend my lifetime loving you and making believe
[ steel - guitar ]
I can't hold you close darling when you're not with me
You're somebody's love and you'll never be mine
Making believe I'll spend my lifetime just loving you and making believeYou ought to see deacon Jones
When he rattles the bones,
Old parson Brown foolin' 'roun like a clown,
Aunt Jemima who is past eighty three,
Shoutin' "I'm full o' pep!
Watch yo' step!, watch yo' step!
One legged Joe danced aroun' on his toe,
Threw away his crutch and hollered, "let 'er go!"
Oh, honey, hail! hail! the gang's all here
For an Alabama jubilee
Mandolins, violins,
Hear the darkies tunin' up, the fun begins,
Come this way, don't delay,
Better hurry, honey dear, or you'll be missin'
Music sweet, rag-time treat,
Goes right to your head and trickles to your feet,
It's a reminder, a memory finder
Of nights down in old Alabam'.
Hear that flute, it's a beaut,
And the tunes it's tootin', tootsie, ain't they cute?
Let's begin, it's a sin,
To be missin' all this syncopated music!
Oh, you Jane, once again
Give your legs some exercise to that refrain,
Boy, that's what makes me so dreamy and takes me
Back home to my old Alabam'.Speed River at my feet running low and flat
I'm sitting here burning daylight,
Thinking about the past
And that distance out there
Where the earth meets the sky
The slightest move and this river mud
Pulls me further down
John's at my side, but he's sitting on firmer ground
John says I look at the moon and the stars
These days more often than I look into his eyes
And I can't disagree so I don't say nothing
I just stare on past his face at Venus rising,
Like a shining speck of hope hanging over the horizon
With each passing year that I sit here
That horizon seems to inch just that much nearer
And all that appears on it seems as clear as spit
But if there's on thing in my life
That these years have taught
It's that you can always see it coming
But you can never stop it
Speed River at my feet running low and flat
I'm sitting here burning daylight,
Thinking about the past
And that distance out there
Where the earth meets the sky
The slightest move and this river mud
Pulls me further down
John's at my side,
But he's not noticing that I'm drowning
The slightest move and this river mud
Pulls me further down
John's at my side,
But he's not noticing that I'm drowning[Chorus]
Sitting alone in the moonlight
Thinking of the days gone by
Wondering about my darling
I can still hear her saying goodbye
Oh, the moon grows pale as I sit here
Each little star seems to whisper and say
Your sweetheart has found another
And now she's far, far away
[Chorus]
Oh, the moon grows pale as I sit here
Each little star seems to whisper and say
Your sweetheart has found another
And now she's far, far awayDown at the bottom of a well
I saw a flash
I never knew what it was
Now I know
The sun, the stars, the moon
And the way that you smile
When I open my front door
All along the road I look for a sign
To tell me if I'm going the right way
All along the road I look for a sign
To tell me if I'm going the right way
Now I know, the rain all night
Leads to a clear blue sky
And the way that you smile
When I open my front door
Down at the bottom of a well
I saw a light
I never knew what it was
Now I know
The golden glow, distant city arrives
And the way that you smile
When I open my front door
All along the road I look for a sign
To tell me if I'm going the right way
All along the road I look for a sign
To tell me if I'm going the right way
Now I know
One kind word
And the way that you smile
When I open my front door
One kind word
And the way that you smile
When I open my front doorYou're the only star in my blue heaven
And you're shining just for me
You're the only star in my blue heaven
And in dreams your face I see
You're the guiding light that brightens up the night
When you came in sight my heart was lonely
You're the only star in my blue heaven
And you're shining just for me
You're the guiding lightI don't believe you love me as much as you left home
But since you feel you only you keep holding on
You'll carry me to any lenght just to prove you have the strenght
And you'll hold me till something better comes along
And then you'll leave me you won't even care
How I feel when I'll awake and you're not there
So I'll just live and love you one day at a time
And until something better comes along your mind
[ guitar + piano ]
If I have a chance my life to rearrange
I couldn't change the things I'd really like to change
By going back the only thing I came this time
Because till something better comes along your mindAfter The Flood (Chris Jonat)
After the flood
When the world is of mud
And we send out the dove
And it doesn't return
Do you think then
All the king's men
Will start over again
Is that when we'll learn
First was the word
Which became flesh
That's only the beginning
I can't remember the rest
It seems I'm always forgetting
First was the fall
Bought by the death
Glory stands waiting
With baited breath
I'm always missing my markWHICH BRIDGE TO CROSS (WHICH BRIDGE TO BURN)
Writer Bill Anderson, Vince Gill
RECORDED BY VINCE GILL
I've got two lovers in my life now A true love and one that's brand new I'm not really sure that I know how To love one and tell one we're through I can't sleep at night, I toss and turn I keep losing sight of lessons I've learned I'm standing at the crossroads with just one concern Which bridge to cross and which bridge to burn I knew this was wrong, I didn't listen Cause a heart only knows what feels right Oh I need to reach a decision And get on with the rest of my life I can't sleep at night, I toss and turn I keep losing sight of lessons I've learned I'm standing at the crossroads with just one concern Which bridge to cross and which bridge to burnA parody of "Who's Your Daddy?"

Enjoy
Go to sleep little baby
Before the boogie man gets you
When you'll awake,
We'll pat a little cake
And ride the pretty little pony...
(spoken)
Shhh...uhuhuh...
It's OK
Ahhh...You so cute...you little wookie wookie wookie wookie
Was it my singin???
You look so much like your daddy
Ha ha
Who's your daddy?
No I'm just kiddin'
I love you so very much
You want..
Uh come here to me...
OOOH...
(sniffs)
Shooo...I think it's time for you to change your little bitty diaper
That little boogie boogie boogie boogie boogie
I love you so much...but I wish you would just quit crying.
Well I'm sittin here rockin our cute little baby
Tell me why you just won't stop cryin'
My little souvenir from Dollywood last Valentine's
Yeah I burped you twice sounded good
Did everything a father should
Read Barney and nursery rhymes
I guess your momma needs a girls night out every once in a while
I put on a brand new diaper baby
Huh huh don't you wet it
Everything was going just fine
Till's you threw up on me when I fed ya
Where's your mommy
I'm going crazy
Call up a buddy
I need a friend
Cause I'm a new dad
Who don't know what to do
When a tummy starts to rumblin
Your diaper's droopin'
You won't stop poopin'
Now I have stood all I can stand
Where's your mommy little baby
You've got a dummy for a dad...
(spoken)
Shhh come on what's wrong with you
Your tummy tummy tummy hurt you
Little pookie pookie pookie pookie
Quit cryin' please...
Well...you're still up past your bedtime baby
Huh huh...ain't cha...Now I've about had it
I never knew what your momma went through
But I do now and I know
UH
I'm no good at it
Where's your mommy
I'm going crazy
How'd you get muddy?
Where have you been?
It's that dang doggie door
That you keep crawlin through
I'll have to nail that thing shut again
You sure are screamin'
You must be teethin
I warmed your bottle
I burned my hand
Where's your mommy little baby
You've got a dummy for a dad...
Here comes your mommy little baby
And your daddy sure is glad...Pour my soul into my song
Playin' for the people all night long
I work hard for my money and I want it now
Don't make me have to tear your juke joint down
[Chorus]
I'm a home homesick gypsy
I was born movin' down the line
I'm a homesick gypsy
I ain't home till I leave you behind
Now I'm hard as a white oak tree
A month on the road and three days sleep
I got a girl in every town I play
I'm sure missin' the one I had yesterday
[Chorus]
My worst nightmare is standin' still
Gotta get my fix of those rollin' wheels
When I die don't ya dig no holes
Just scatter my ashes where the strong wind blows
[Chorus]
I ain't home till I leave you behindWe're in the right place at the right time and it's easy to go wrong
The soft light shine just right tonight on your lovely face
And a haunting sound of music seem to fill the place
We're both eager to forget life that waits at home
We're in the right place at the right time and it's easy to go wrong
Yes everything is much too right tonight
As we watch our hearts sink slowly out of sight
And being eager to forget life that waits at home
We're in the right place at the right time and it's easy to go wrong
[ ac.guitar ]
Your kiss is fine there's warm desire in each embrace
And the wine is fine and that makes us want to stay
We both know that it's not right but this feeling is so strong
We're in the right place at the right time and it's easy to go wrong
Yes everything is much too right...If I could have the world and all it owns
A thousand kingdoms, a thousand thrones
If all the earth were mine to hold
With wealth my only goal
I'd spend my gold on selfish things
Without the love that Your life brings
Just a little bit more is all I'd need
'Til life was torn from me
I'd rather be in the palm of Your hand
Though rich or poor I may be
Faith can see right through the circumstance
Sees the forest in spite of the trees
Your grace provides for me
If I should walk the streets no place to sleep
No faith in promises You keep
I'd have no way to buy my bread
With a bottle for my bed
But if I trust the One who died for me
Who shed His blood to set me free
If I live my life to trust in You
Your grace will see me through
I'd rather be in the palm of Your hand
Though rich or poor I may be
Faith can see right through the circumstance
Sees the forest in spite of the trees
If I could have the world
If I could have the world and all it ownsBy now I guess she's wondering how I'm doing
If it broke my heart when she told me goodbye
Well, every night I sleep just like a baby
I wake up every hour and cry.
I bet she don't think I'm going miss her
Probably think she's always on my mind
But every night I sleep just like a baby
I wake up every hour and cry.
She believes that I can't live with out her
And it hurts so bad sometimes I almost die
Well, every night I sleep just like a baby
I wake up every hour and cry.
You know I'll bet way down deep
That she thinks that I'll always love her
And I'll bet she thinks I'll never love another
No matter how hard I try.
'Cause every night I sleep just like a baby
I wake up every hour and cry.
Lord, every night I sleep just like a little bitty baby
I wake up every hour and cry...I never knew the power of a song,
Till I heard the music playin',
The day that momma passed on.
Never knew what innocence was about,
Till the first time I laid eyes on the face,
Of a newborn child.
I never knew love,
No I mean real love,
I never knew that kind of love,
Till this moment with you.
I never understood the meaning of home,
Till I pulled into that old dirt drive,
After being gone too long.
I didn't know what serenity really was,
Till I stopped one day to listen to,
A river gently run.
I never knew love,
No I mean real love,
I never knew that kind of love,
Till this moment with you.
I've known the hunger before tonight,
For other loves.
I felt the yearning,
I felt the fire,
In their touch.
But this goes deeper,
Than anything I've ever known.
Beyond my heart,
Clear down to my soul.
I never knew what beauty could behold,
Till you looked at me, and I could see,
Forever unfold.
Oh, you made me whole.
I never knew love,
No I mean real love,
I never knew that kind of love,
Till this moment with you.
Till I was loved, by you.Tiger woman I heard that you were back in town (tiger woman)
Tiger woman I heard that you were back in town (tiger woman)
Just like a tiger woman girl you're still puttin' puttin' around
Tiger woman I wonder why I love you still (tiger woman)
Tiger woman I wonder why I love you still (tiger woman)
Just like a tiger woman I guess you come back home for the kill
Well you tore me up in little bitty pieces you dragged me all over the ground
I was a big man but now I ain't nothin' you sure know how to put a good man down
Tiger woman put your long short claws out of me (tiger woman)
Tiger woman put your long short claws out of me (tiger woman)
Just like a tiger woman what you leave ain't so good to see
[ guitar ]
Well you tore me up...
Tiger woman well you better just keep movin' on (tiger woman)
Tiger woman I said you better just keep movin' on (tiger woman)
Just like a tiger tamer I'm gonna put you where you belong
(Hey looky here woman I don't like the way you come slink around me
I don't like that look you've got in your eye nor neither...)It's a big house,
With all this things you assume and sure of
In the big world
With all these things you never heard of.
But fix me up now, if it seems that I need fixing
Correct me, if I stand to be correct it, mhm
It's a sad song
All these worlds you heard enough of
Pray for wthat you are
With only side you wanna follow
Left me up now, let me walk amongst the gifted
If I'm asking too much, just as please, be comfort in, oh
Every morning when you're mean
To keep your hands clean
It's running down your arms
Casting shadows on your heart
You show me how to die
cut the price on how to cry
You show me out of time
Yes I'll catch you by and by
Mhm yeah.
It's a deep hole, when you dug with all your lyin'
It's a fact poor
And you don't know, I know it's flyin'
And save his need and savings
When the shore you ..
but lovers need to let down
But you figure out with heartens
Every morning when you're mean
To keep those hands clean
But it's running down your arms
Oh it's tearing you apart.
You've spoken to the sky
And you lied a million times
Show me how to die
I guess I'll catch you on the side
Mhmi took her on a simple trip
to see her husbands family
and on the way upon her hip
was laid my head down gently
all due respect was meant and all
the winds were in agreement
that this was answering the call
of awkward and true feeling
a fireman her husband was
and so to give him duty
i duly tried to light a fire
upon his rightful booty
but beauty was my treasure then
as through the hills i drove her
and taught her that another man
could have made love to her
strange is good if it is kept
a secret with the lovers
who love their mates
and love themselves
and need the love of others
through the window i could see
the fields and clouds all passing
as in the passenger position
eleanor was thrashing
i stopped the car we got a beer
and then eased down the road
a little guilt, and some guilt spilt
and added to our loadWe've been through some things together
With trunks of memories still to come
We found things to do in stormy weather
Long may you run
Long may you run
Long may you run
Although these changes have come
With your chrome heart shining in the sun
Long may you run
Well it was back in Blind River in 1962
When I last saw you alive
Rollin' down that empty ocean road
Gettin' to the surf on time
Long may you run
Long may you run
Although these changes have come
With your chrome heart shining in the sun
Long may you run
Long may you run
Long may you runBeneath her clothes her heart is breaking
Spends her mornings making lines
Though her pain is real and aching
All she owns are borrowed lines
Doesn't know which side to be on
Though she's trying every door
Only needs the floor she sleeps on
All she asks is a little more time
Bobbie's gone to California
I won't see her anymore
Bobbie's gone to California
Like she did the year before
And the year before
The day she left her shirt was clinging
To her back wet with rain
I watched her leave heard her singing
A song she wrote when Christmas came
Bobbie's young but getting older
The face she shows is not her own
Winter's near it's getting colder
California's called her home again
Bobbie's gone to California
I won't see her anymore
Bobbie's gone to California
Like she did the year before
And the year before
The mirror gives back no reflection
Of shadow she will not see
It understands she needs protection
Of what she swears she has to be
Bobbie's nights are empty tables
Hold her 'til she's made to leave
Bobbie's dreams are empty fables
She makes herself believe
To be free
Sometimes she cried because of visions
Of what she loved had all been sold
There's not much left no one to listen
To the echoes that she holds
How could I tell her when she's fading
She run out of a place to be
There will be no one waiting
For the poetry of her soul
I won't see her anymore
Bobbie's gone to California
Like she did the year before
And the year beforeI made a promise to myself
Never again
To get burned by someone else
Until you walked in
I felt the old magic begin
I felt the room startin' to spin
As my will came tumbling down
I can't help it if I'm blindhearted
Fallin' again
I can't help it if my has started
Slowly cavin' in
And I keep on holdin' out for you
Oh, I guess I'm just a blindhearted fool
I've got to find a way to live
On my own
I need to find someone who'll give
Me love that's strong
It's like a race against time
Until your face enters my mind
And you still
Burn me to the ground
I can't help it if I'm blindhearted
Fallin' again
I can't help it if my has started
Slowly cavin' in
And I keep on holdin' out for you
Oh, I guess I'm just a blindhearted fool
Tell everyone to gather 'round
They won't believe the view
They're looking at a blindhearted fool
Over you(D. Fekaris/D. Loeb)
I've been waiting for so long
For someone who's as wonderful as you
Someone who's kind and always cares
And baby you're the answer to my prayers
You appear and I'm brand new
I love it, hey, I love it 'cause it's you
And for all the sweet things that you do
You got a little present comin' you
You pick me up
You keep me high up in the sky
Honey, yes you, you fill my cup
You keep a shiny and twinkling light in my eye
I've been savin' it for you
All my love, all my love, all my lovin' for tonight
I've been savin' it for you
For you, for you, for you Mister Right
I've been savin' it for you
All my love, all my love, all my lovin' for tonight
I've been savin' it for you
For you, for you Mister Right
All those worries back in town
Forget them 'cause they're nowhere to be found
All you find right here is love
And baby you are what I' ve been dreamin' of
Close the door and feel the fire
I'll love you, hey, I'll love you to the wire
And for the wonders you inspire
You got a little present comin' you
You pick me up
You keep me high up in the sky
Honey, yes you, you fill my cup
You keep a shiny and twinkling light in my eye
I've been savin' it for you
All my love, all my love, all my lovin' for tonight
I've been savin' it for you
For you, for you, for you Mister Right
I've been savin' it for you
All my love, all my love, all my lovin' for tonight
I've been savin' it for you
For you, for you Mister Right
Let's say hello a special way
Lovers who love and love to play
You have been all that I can think about
There's never a doubt it's you
And you alone that turns me on
Anticipation now is gone
And we're alone
So just get comfy and, oh yeah, unplug the phone
I've been savin' it for you
All my love, all my love, all my lovin' for tonight
I've been savin' it for you
For you, for you, for you Mister Right
I've been savin' it for you
All my love, all my love, all my lovin' for tonight
I've been savin' it for you
For you, for you Mister Right
Savin' it for you
I've been savin' it, savin' it, savin' it for you
Savin' it for you
Been savin' it for you Mister RightHow long will I love you
I don't really know
I'd like to think forever
Is how far we could go so let me paint a picture
Of how it's gonna be
The day you don't mean everything to me
When a nickel's worth a dollar
And gold ain't worth a dime
When they build a ship
On waters that will take you back in time
When the stars have all been counted
And I stop lovin' you
Honey they'll be driving
Buicks to the moon
Now you don't have to worry
About what comes to pass
This old world may wear out
But my love's gonna last
If they ever build that highway to the moon
I'll just fond somethin' else to promise you
When a nickel's worth a dollar
And gold ain't worth a dime
When they build a ship
On waters that will take you back in time
When the stars have all been counted
And I stop lovin' you
Honey they'll be driving
Buicks to the moonThe thing about a breakup
Sometimes you just gotta break down
Coming off a great love
There's plenty of pain to pass around
Like a tip jar in a dive bar
Full of broken hearts
It's a lonely crowd
The thing about a breakup
Sometimes you just gotta break down
When the only thing you want is
The only thing that you can't have
When the part that you can't take is
Knowing you can't take it back
She's on the good side, goodbye
On the right sight of free
And you're on the wrong end of a long night
On the left side of leavin'
Yeah
On the left side of leavin'
The thing about a last kiss
You never know that it's the last
Till they call the last call
And you're just drinking about the past
Like the bottom of the bottle
Knows how to get her back
The thing about a last kiss
You never know that it's the last
When the only thing you want is
The only thing that you can't have
When the part that you can't take is
Knowing you can't take it back
She's on the good side, goodbye
On the right sight of free
And you're on the wrong end of a long night
On the left side of leavin'
Yeah
On the left side of leavin'
Stuck on the left side
You're on the drunk part of drinking
The can't stop part of thinking
The wide awake part of sleeping, woah
You're on the broke part of breaking
The mistake part of making
You're on the cane part of shaking, woah
When the only thing you want is
The only thing that you can't have
When the part that you can't take is
Knowing you can't take it back
She's on the good side, goodbye
On the right sight of free
And you're on the wrong end of a long night
On the left side of leavin'
Yeah
On the left side of leavin'Granddaddy used to sit me on his knee
And tell me how it was in the old country
Famine and floods and crops that failed
I'd listen for hours as he told his tale
He said, "There must have been a curse on the family name"
But he swore he'd be the one to break that chain
With money that he saved from the sweat of his brow
He'd get 'em out of there, someday, somehow
[Chorus]
Well, he never was much of a gamblin' man
But he dreamed of passage to the Promised Land
Bet it all on a better life in America
He said, "We'll change our fate, and this danged O'Reilly Luck"
I can only imagine the look on his face
Tickets in hand, as they counted the days
Eleven passports, no turnin' back
Decidin' what they should and shouldn't pack
But the baby caught the fever just days before
And the doctor hung a sheet on their front door
For two long weeks they were quarantined
Stranded with nothin' but a shattered dream
[Chorus]
Granddaddy told this story 'til he passed away
How the people all cheered from the dock that day
While he shook his fist with a tear in his eye
At the beautiful ship of the White Star Line
And he cursed his fate and his danged O'Reilly Luck
As the mighty Titanic, sailed into the sun
[Chorus]
Danged O'Relly Luck"Love is a thing of joy forever if it doesn't change like the weather
Yours can calls a sunny smiles and make tears fall like rain
And I wonder is the joy worth the pain
Is the joy of loving you worth the pain you put me through
Why I come back for more I can't explain
You make me feel ten feet tall while I'm riding for a fall
So I wonder is the joy worth the pain
[ piano ]
I give up my soul to win your love make it if my heart is not enough
It hurts to know I lose more ground than I can ever gain
And I wonder is the joy worth the pain
Is the joy of loving you...When Mama Cried
( Written by Daron Norwood / Wayne Perry )
I was standing in the hall when they called the doctor in
Almost scared me half to death
When they said "It's a boy again"
I walked in just in time to see them lay him by her side
And when she looked into my newborn brother's eyes
Mama cried
When I was just a teenage boy a preacher man stopped by
He asked me if I knew the Lord
Said "If you don't, then tell me why"
I gave my heart to God that day, and then I was baptized
And when I stood up at church to testify
Oh, Mama cried
Chorus:
When Mama cried
You could feel the love she felt down deep inside
Through the good times and the bad times of my life
Oh you could see the love she had in her eyes
When Mama cried
T.H.S. graduation day in 1985
Standing in the high school gym decorated blue and white
And when they called my name out loud
You'd thought someone had died
'Cause when we sang the Alma Mater one last time
Oh Mama cried
Dressed up in our Sunday best, the family gathered 'round
Me and brother standing there with our heads bowed down
Flowers on the alter and a lady dressed in white
And when the preacher said "Son you can kiss your bride"
Sweet Mama cried
Chorus:
When Mama cried
You could feel the love she felt down deep inside
Through the good times and the bad times of my life
Oh you could see the love she had in her eyes
When Mama cried
When Mama criedThrough the years I've prepared feeling sure that you cared
I believe I'm entitled to you
And with you on my mind in my heart I'm inclined
To believe I'm entitled to you
The happy day I found you I built my dreams around you
And I began to pray that they come true
Now I can't live without you and yet somehow I doubt you
Why not turn my grey skies into blue
Through the years I've prepared...
[ steel ]
The picture that I've painted when we became up acquainted
And I've began to plan to just for two
And you're a gift God gave dear yes you're all I craved dear
An angel came from heaven it was you
Through the years I've prepared...SerÃ¡ que amar sozinho vai ser a minha sina
JÃ¡ conheÃ§o vocÃª bem mais do que imagina

SerÃ¡ que um dia vai me amar(4x)Here comes heaven all satin and lace
Love in her heart and a smile on her face
She's the world to me
Heaven is all my heart can see
Here comes heaven with soft golden hair
Laughing blue eyes that tell me she cares
She's my night my day
Heaven is just a kiss away
I was so lonely till she took my hand
She lifted in my eyes and she made me understand
Here comes heaven like spring soft and warm
I'd give my life to keep her from harm
She makes my heart sing
Here comes heaven again
Here comes heaven againI've never known one better
She's a real go getter
If you met her you'd be good as gone
She's a real red liner
Likes it all behind her
She's the kind that keeps you hangin' on
She's a cowboy's buddy
Even when she gets muddy
Lord she's lovely from her front to back
So either comin' or goin'
Know her best side's showin'
She's my cowboy Cadillac
She's the perfect picture
Of the perfect mixture
Tween a woman and a fine machine
She's a hard work lover
A real tough mother
She's the cover of a magazine
And I'm happy knowin'
That what keeps me goin'
Is what's gonna keep me comin' back
She's my honkin' tonkin'
Everything I'm wantin'
Cowboy Cadillac
She loves to haul them cattle
All my ropes and saddle
And it doesn't matter work or play
If it's a mountain she can crawl it
If it's hay then she can haul it
She's the last one to call it a dayMomma's tears fell so easy
Daddy's handshake was strong
Then I climbed aboard that Greyhound
Eighteen and glad to be gone
Took a rented room on Broadway
And as I unpacked everything I owned
I found a note my mama left me
With a Bible and a bus ticket home
It said one will get you where you're going
When you haven't got a prayer
And one will bring you back, son
If your dreams ain't waiting there
You're out on your own now
We won't be there to fall back on
But you know we're never farther than
A Bible and a bus ticket home
The years have come and gone and taken
The only things in life I ever counted on
But I'm going back tomorrow
To lay flowers at their stone
I can almost hear my mama calling saying
Son come back where you belong
You've got all you need to get here
A Bible and a bus ticket home
It said one will get you,
Boy, you know we're never farther than
A Bible and a bus ticket homeGot six bucks that's enough for a beer run
Now all we need is someone to do the buying
My buddy Lendell, he ain't never got no money
But he drinks up most the beer everytime
By nine o'clock got a half case between us
Pull into the quick pick Lendell had to have some smoke
There sit Susie in Billy Cotts camaro
Lendell gives her a wink Billy says, "Want ya neck broke?"
Their 'bout to go toe to toe
Here comes a cop car
Lendell says the cemetery bill
Well see how bad you are
Another Friday night in this oil patch town
Keep the beers outta sight when the state troopers come around
And we ain't lookin' for trouble wouldn't mind a fight
What else you gonna do it's just another Friday night
Billy says, "Let's get it on" and Lendell just slugs him
That's 'bout all the fightin' that got done
Sheriff pulls up he says "What you hoodlums doing?"
"Nothing much junior just tryin' to have some fun"
He's acting tough and taking names
And shuttin' us down
But at least we got something to talk about
When Monday rolls around
Another Friday night in this oil patch town
Keep the beers outta sight when the state troopers come around
Now we ain't lookin' for trouble wouldn't mind a fight
What else you gonna do it's just another Friday night
Friday night in this oil patch townThe kiwi and the liquid gold
For helen would have surely knowed
I'd love her if it weren't that i
Bind myself to a single joy
I was sleeping with my lgo
I was polishing my midnight runners
I was handling my regal tip
Cold beer and my prison rolls
Take a good look at the patchwork
That hellen saw on my foot
Well she took a look around, friend
Yeah she took her love to town, friend
I was sleeping with my lgo
I was polishing my midnight runners
I was handling my regal tip
Cold beer and my prison rolls
I got eyes I can't stand it
Jalepeños inbetween my toes
The duke of earl and smoking joe
All the kiwi and the liquid gold
I was sleeping with my lgo
I was polishing my midnight runners
I was handling my regal tip
Cold beer and my prison rolls
I'm gonna eat my damn 8 year old shoesOoh
Baby last night was hands down
One of the best nights
That I've had no doubt
Between the bottle of wine
And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern lights
If I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man, oh yes I could
Baby that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You're a saint, you're a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, the masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
What I need in this life is your crazy love
I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
You're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace
If I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man
Baby I could die a happy man
Oh I could die a happy man
Ooh (happy man)
Baby I could die a happy manBy now I really should be over you
But I might as well just give up tryin`
You've got what's missin` deep inside me
And I want it back, girl you know it's mine
[Chorus]
Send back my heart if you don't want it
Send back my heart girl, the one you stole away
You've made it plain, your names not on it
S don't put me through one more blue and lonely day
Send back my heart
I've found somebody else wants my love
But I can't give her what she needs
The very thing she's wantin` still ain't mine to give
So won't you let it go, please baby please
I've tried to forget you girl just like you told me to
But baby that's impossible, so now it's up to youEver since that night you walked out
I just ain't been the same ol' me
I've barely had the strength
To leave the couch to turn on my TV
But a man can't hide away forever
And last night I finally told me so
I knew I had to get out
But I knew I had to take it slow
So I burned down this town
A honky tonk at a time
I got loud and checked out
Every cute little cowgirl I could hold
Getting over you is still a long ways away
I swear
Last night was one small step
But you gotta start somewhere
Think I feel a little better
A little more like the man I used to be
I ain't saying that I'm there yet
But I can see some possibilities
When your motor ain't been fired up lately
You can't just jam it in gear and go
I know I'm still not up to speed
But last night I had to test the roadWell I made my way from Nasheville, the loving of the Georgia pines
Worked my way to Alabam, didn't even make a dime
Well I wish I was right there with you, my brand new shirt and shoes
Talking about our next move, thinking about these blues
Well if I had a thousand dollars, I'd fly home to you take you
To the Suwannee river, take you on a trip for two
But I'm a sad, lonesome rambler
My money's almost spent
Thinking about my baby's... forgot to pay the rent
Can't you see that little bird flying from pine to pine
He's mourning for his true love, just like I mourn for mine
Too many motel rooms, from bar to bar I go
Ain't paying a cent here, having a drink before the show
i'm feeling weary, weary to the bone
Everyone looks so cheery, but me I'm all alone
But I'm a sad, lonesome rambler
My money's almost spent
Thinking about my baby's... forgot to pay the rentDon't want to go to the movies
Or spend the day in the park
I don't want no one to call me
I just want to be alone with my heart
And think of the way that you held me
The touch of your lips on my face
Surround myself in your memory
[Chorus]
It's just one of those days
I want to lay in my sorrow
I want to drown in my tears
Don't want to think of tomorrow
Until these thoughts disappear
Then I'll be back on my feet again
Before it's too late
As for now I want to be alone
It's just one of those days
It's just one of those days
I want to think about Texas
Driving the coast of Malibu
Wherever my minds wants to take us
I don't care long as I'm there with you
Why do I put myself through this when
Most of the time I'm okay
But here and now I can feel it
[Chorus]These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers
This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand
With ignorance and legitimate excuses
The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much but we'll take our chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all God's children
Crept out the back door
And it's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above
Say it's much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time
This is the year of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year
These are the days of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here
So you scream from behind your door
And say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much but I'll take my chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back?
'Cause he has no children to come back for
And it's hard to love
When there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above
Say it's much, much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for timeDrunk on the blood of a hero's welcome, babe
Ringin' in the year with a ticker tape parade
While the motorcade is stretched from First to Main
Calamity Jane, shootin' off that mouth again
Hey, hey, hey
Pin all your sins on your Man of Sorrow then
Stroll through the crowd with a black mantilla, friend
While they're whisperin' like locusts in the grain
Calamity Jane
Hit it on the nose again
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Calamity Jane
Calamity Jane
Calamity Jane
Washed in the tears of the revolution, babe
Born in the back of a Studebaker
American made
Ah but girl have you no shame
Calamity Jane
Honey, take heart and take aim
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Calamity Jane
Calamity Jane
Calamity Jane
Calamity JaneIn a castle keep, in a vault of stone, in a house at the end of the lane
And old man weeps in his door alone and he sings out this mournful refrain
She will not come back, she will not come back
Though the mountains fall down to the sea
And the sky burns to cinders and the river runs black
She will not come back to me
No lightnin' rede from his books of lore, and the staff in the corner, no fire
And the crystal ball always bright before is grey as the dust of desire
She will not come back, she will not come back
Though he call on the powers that be
They will cipher this message in his cold zodiac
She will not come back to me
And joy my love was a dancin spring, and life was the touch of her lips
And a brook ran mad to my cave downstream from the miracle hills of her hips
She will not come back, she will not come back
Though the stars hang their tears in the trees
And tireless Orion lies spent in his tracks
She will not come back
She will not come back
She will not come back to meWith a dark and rolling sea
Between my love and me
I keep walking thru this cold hard town
While i wait for better days
I could use a place to stay
Or a floor where I could lay my blanket down
If I could beg, steal, or borrow
A ticket on some boat or plane
I'd be leaving London tomorrow
To fly to my young love again
Up at dawn to change my shirt
And to wash away the dirt
Then it's over to American Express
Not one letter did I find
No, she didn't send one line
T
ALast night as I laid on the prairie and looked at the stars in the sky
I wondered if ever a cowboy would drift to that sweet by and by
Roll along roll along roll on little doggies roll on roll on
Roll along roll along roll on little doggies roll on roll on
The road to that bright happy region is a dim narrow trail so they say
But the broad one that leads to prediction is posted and blazed all the way
They say there will be a great roundup and cowboys like doggies will stand
To be marched by the riders of judgement who are posted and know every brand
Roll along roll along...
They say he will never forget you that he knows every action and look
So for safety you'd better get branded have your name in the great Tally Book
Roll along roll along...It's been so long darling since I gazed into your eyes
It's been so long darling do you really realize
That just the thought of seeing you it scares me through and through
It's been so long darling since I had a kiss from you
It's been so long darling since I had to go away
It's been so long darling and I can't forget that day
Although you never mentioned it you cried the whole day long
It's been so long darling but now I'm coming home
[ strings ]
It's been so long darling since I gazed into your eyes...It's good to hear your voice after all this time
I've been told I'm hard to find
It's raining here but I'm keeping dry
And for me that's doing good
To tell the truth there ain't much to know
I've dealt some cards and I've rodeo'd
But I haven't found that pot of gold
Like I said I would
Between the high lines and the fence posts
The interstate and the dirt roads
No matter how the wind blows I hear your name
Out of all the things I've done that I regret
There's only one I'd like to change
Out here, between the rainbows and the rain
I spent last month in Santa Fe
I heard your daddy passed away
And I should've called your momma
To say how sorry that I am
Well, I don't think I'll be coming back
Spent too long, so I guess that's that
It's nice to know that you still ask about me now and then
Between the high lines and the fence posts
The interstate and the dirt roads
No matter how the wind blows I hear your name
Out of all the things I've done that I regret
There's only one I'd like to change
Out here, between the rainbows and the rain
Out here, between the rainbows and the rain[Chorus]
Nobody but a fool would love you
After the way you've done me
Broke every vow you made me, broke every rule
Who'd lie awake all night, cry til you were out of sight
Loving you with all her might
Nobody but a fool
I don't know what it was that made me trust you like I did
Stars got in my eyes or either rocks got in my head
All I know was your two lips kissed me heavenly
Til yesterday those tender lips kissed goodbye to me
I put on the saddest song ignore the telephone
I go ahead and cry the make-up from my eyes
I let my mind play tricks and then
I let it fool me once again
Into thinkin' that I'll never be alright
Then when I'm no longer crazy and I'm back to my old self
I realize how good I've always felt
[Chorus]
People tried to tell me how you'd hurt me I suppose
But I was blind as any bat and deaf as any post
You clawed me like a tiger, I loved you like a lamb
And knowing I still do just shows me up for what I am
[Chorus]
Nobody but a fool
Nobody but a foolIt was in the spring one sunny day
My good gal left me Lord she went away
And now she's gone but I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
She called me up from down in El Paso
Said come back, daddy, Lord I need you so
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Show me a woman a man can trust
Mississippi River, long, deep and wide
The woman I'm loving is on the other side
You don't like my peaches, don't you shake my tree
Get out of my orchard, let my peaches be
Don't you come here running, holding out your hand
I'll get me a woman like you got your manWhat a friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and griefs to bear
And what a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer
Oh, what peace we often forfeit
Oh, what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer
Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged
Take it to the Lord in prayer
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness
Take it to the Lord in prayerOopsie daisy I'm losin' my mind
Hold me now, hold me now
Clock on the wall says
I'm outta time
Hold me now, hold me now
I gotta reason but
I'm all outta rhyme
Hold me now, hold me now
Sometimes the answers are just so hard to find
Hold me now
When my grip on the day
Starts slippin' away
If I'm gonna fall at all
I'm gonna fall in love with you
Here I go I'm fallin' again
Hold me now, hold me now
It always happens when your love comes in
Hold me now, hold me now
My hopes and dreams have been left out in the cold
Hold me now, hold me now
Feels like the world is spinnin' outta control
Hold me now
When my grip on the day (when my grip on the day)
Starts slippin' away (starts slippin' away)
If I'm gonna fall at all
I'm gonna fall in love with you
Here I go I'm fallin' again
Hold me now, hold me now
It all gets better when your love comes in
Hold me now
I'm gonna fall in love with you
Here I go I'm fallin' again
Hold me now, hold me now
It always happens when your love comes in
Hold me now, hold me now
Here I go I'm fallin' again
Hold me now, hold me now
It all gets better when your love comes in
Hold me now, hold me now
Hold me nowUsed to go with my grandpa up to the town square
Set him down up there on a picnic bench
And he used to play checkers with them other old menup there
They used to tell stories bout when they were kids
Grandpa says he shot the Chief of Police when he was nine years old
I believe it
Cause they tell me Harlan Knetucky was the baddest place in the world
Why they say they used to sit out there on their front porch
Shoot them revenuers when they'd come down the hollow
Said they was so young took two of them boys
To hold the rifle and one to pull the trigger
Well grandpa he'd lie a little bit
But I'll tell you there's a lot of stories in Harlan County
Yeah folks in Harlan County Lord they knew that we were poor
They always called my daddy Preacher Dan
But daddy weren't no preacher least ways I don't recallect
Never hear of papa talk of nothin' but the land
Daddy was a God fearin' farmer yes he was
Could not read nor write Lord he could barely sign his name
Daddy was a God fearin' farmer all his life someday when I'm grown I'll be the same
Well he always grew tobacco though he did not smoke himself
He had the best tobacco crop around
And he never touched a drop of liquor that I can recall
Papa made his livin' on the ground
Yes Sunday go to meetin' called for more than he could stand
I guess he felt at home in his old clothes
But he never missed a Sunday takin' mama to the church
Maybe it was habit Lord but heaven only knows
Daddy was a God fearin' farmer...
[ steel - fiddle ]
Yeah folks in Harlan County Lord....
Someday when I'm grown I'll be the same someday when I'm grown I'll be the sameAt first you gotta learn how not to listen
When she opens up her heart
You try your best to make it all about you
Yeah, that's the easy part
Take all your promises and break 'em
Stay out late and come home high
By this time you're on your way
It's going to be over any day
And if you really try, you won't have to wonder why
Take it from a man who knows
Just how to break a heart
Listen hard and listen close
I got it down to an art
Keep on thinkin' she won't leave
You know the writing on the wall
That's how you lose it all
Let the walls fall down around you
Let the bills and dishes stack up to the sky
Makes friends with regret
Try your damnedest to forget
And I bet you never will, no I swear you never will
Take it from a man who knows
Just how to break a heart
Listen hard and listen close
I got it down to an art
Keep on thinkin' she won't leave
You know the writing on the wall
That's how you lose it all, yeah
Take it from a man who knows
Just how to break a heart
Listen hard and listen close
I got it down to an art
Keep on thinkin' she won't leave
You know the writing on the wall
That's how you lose it all
You lose it all
Take all your promises and break them
OhVerse 1
Summer nights by the old marina in a seaside town south of Mendocino
We were college bound kids getting all untied we'd sleep all day and be up all night
spent our time numbin our minds on nirvana and fireball
Ain't it funny how time flies and those nights get harder and harder to recall
Chorus
Oh I miss, I miss sweet Monterey fast boats and hot lazy days
You up on my shoulders with the fireworks raining down
We couldn't wait to get out of there
But now I know what I had back there
In Monterey
Verse 2
Police lights flashin on the girls of summer, dumping beer on a beach man what a bummer
We were Frat house camping , we were beer bong kings, didn't have twenty dollars but we had everything
Football by truck light, guitars and fist fights, talking round fires till dawn
Smell of sunrise coffee and holdin sweet Maggie as she nodded off in my arms
Chorus
Oh I miss, I miss sweet Monterey fast boats and hot lazy days
You up on my shoulders with the fireworks raining down
We couldn't wait to get out of there
And now I know what I had back there
In Monterey
Instrumental
Chorus
Oh I miss, I miss sweet Monterey fast boats and hot lazy days
You up on my shoulders with the fireworks raining down
We couldn't wait to get out of there
And now I know what I had back there
In MontereyLet's take time out to get acquainted again
We're man and wife we might as well be friends
You don't kiss me like you used to kiss me
Sometimes I take that there must be somebody new
And when I come home at night you act like you didn't even miss me
Lately honey I've even had my doubts about you
We used to face the world and life together
We used to talk of our ambitions and our dreams
But lately we've been takin' our love for granted
We have time for everything except each other it seems
Let's take time out...
[ steel ]
Let's go away and spend some time together
And see if that old spark of love's still burning bright
I want us to be close you know like we used to be
And not just two ships that pass each other in the night
Let's take time out...Well my old shoes are layin' on the floor 'cause I ain't a-gonna wear 'em no more
They took me many miles down many hard roads but that's what shoes are for
The time has flown and I've outgrown every shoe I ever wore
And I guess my bare feet will have to carry me one road more
Lord I ain't got a lick of sense, I got a crazy mind
'Cause I don't wanna leave and I don't wanna stay behind
Well at the end of this one last road they say there's always an open door
And I guess my bare feet will have to carry me one road more
Well I never could move my feet too fast in a pair of rich man's shoes
And a rain shoe's life can last as long as a woman's blues
Well I told the line this one last time, now I got something else in store
And I guess my bare feet will have to carry me one road more
Lord I ain't got a lick of sense, I got a crazy mind
'Cause I don't wanna leave and I don't wanna stay behind
Well at the end of this one last road they say there's always an open door
And I guess my bare feet will have to carry me one road more
OK, let's go Joey
Well I've walked through the city streets in the sun and the rain and the wind and the snow
And I've walked through the mountains and the valleys when there was nowhere else to go
This time I'll just follow the wind and it can blow and the rain can pour
And my bare feet are gonna have to carry me one road more
Lord I ain't got a lick of sense, I got a crazy mind
'Cause I don't wanna leave and I don't wanna stay behind
Well at the end of this one last road they say there's always an open door
And I guess my bare feet will have to carry me one road more
Yeah my bare feet are gonna have to carry me one road moreI play an old guitar from nine 'till half past one
I'm just trying to make a living watching everyone else have fun
I don't miss much if it happens on the dance hall floor
I said mercy look what just walked through that door
Hello T-R-O-U-B-L-E
What in the world are you doing A-L-O-N-E
Hey good L-O-O-K-I-N-G
I smell T-R-O-U-B-L-E
I was a little bitty baby when my papa hit the skids
Mamma had a time trying to raise nine kids
She taught me not to stare cause it was impolite
She did the best she could trying to raise me right
But mama never taught me bout nothing like Y-O-U
I Bet your mama must have been a good lookin' honey too
Hey, good L-O-O-K-I-N-G
I smell T-R-O-U-B-L-E
You sweet talking sexy walkin honky tonkin' baby
The men are gonna' love you, the women are gonna' hate you
Reminding them of everything they're never gonna' be
It maybe the beginning of the world war three
'Cause the world ain't ready for nothing like Y-O-U
Bet your mama must have been a good looking honey too
Hey, good L-O-O-K-I-N-G
I smell T-R-O-U-B-L-EShe's been playin' them low life honky tonks for thirty years in Texas.
She's sick and tired of all them Reba songs they keep requestin'.
She's about to lose her voice, her hair's fallin' out and ain't nobody clappin'.
So she think's she'll shape her head, buy a boom box and just turn to rappin'.
She can't keep up, with them country healthers,
Gonna learn to shake her boobies, just like Salt N' Peppa.
She done gone funky, a brand new tattoo.
She done gone funky, a big nose ring too.
She done gone funky, her favouite rap song's "Shoop".
She done gone funky,
Hah, you go girl!
Well, he never was good at suckin' up to all them country disc jockeys.
It seemed like dag-blammed week, then some new hat act bumped him off the Opry.
He had to sell his bus, his house, his cows: ain't had a hit since the sixties.
Well he's fed with hearin' about: Travis, Garth, Tim McGraw, Collin Raye, Billy Ray Cyrus, John Michael Montgomery, and Joe Diffie.
He saw Johnny Cash on MTV,
Bought a new new toupee, said: "That's the place for me."
He done gone funky, too ahead for his boots.
He done gone funky, burned his cowboy boots.
He done gone funky, wearin' platform shoes.
He done gone funky!
Oh, Suki.
Oh well, he moved up to Nashville, had big dreams of being a songwriter.
Ha ha, 'bout the only things he's written down lately are some orders down at Brown's diner.
If everybody's gone country, like Ali Jackson says,
Gonna move to Los Angeles and buy him a drum machine.
He done gone funky, hangin' out with old Sloop.
Doggy Dog, sippin' on gin and juice
He done gone funky, do wets for two live crew.
He done gone funky.
I feel good.
He done gone funky.
He done gone funky.
He done gone funky.
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, funky.
He done gone funky.
She done gone funky.It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton, and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And mama hollered out the back door, y'all, remember to wipe your feet
And then she said, I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
Today, Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
And papa said to mama, as he passed around the blackeyed peas
Well, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits, please
There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow
And mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
And brother said he recollected when he, and Tom, and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
And mama said to me, child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all morning, and you haven't touched a single bite
That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie BridgeThe old hometown looks the same as I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and my papa
And down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green, grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reaching smiling sweetly
It's so good to touch the green, green, grass of home
The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's the old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green, grass of home
Then I awake and look around me
At the gray walls that surround me
And I realized I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch the green, green, grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green, green, grass of homewake up wake up little maggie
why do you sleep so sound
them highway robbers are a coming
gone a tear your play house down
oh where is my little darling
the girl I love so dear
she's gone away and left me
andis a courtin some other one
I got drunk in the city
then I stumbled and fell at her door
she throwed her little arms around me
but she bid me come back no more
Oh my head bows down like the willow
and I'm lonesome like a dove
sometimes there's tears on my pillow
when I think about my loveIt's taken me some time to read the writing on the wall
But I have finally figured out just what's been going on
And I need to tell you what I've learned before you turn to go
There's things about that other man I think you should know
The man that came between us was looking out for number one
He didn't care how bad he hurt you by the selfish things he'd done
But looking in the mirror, today, I finally came to see
That man that came between us was me
I know I'm sorry don't make up for half the tears you've cried
And I can't promise miracles but I swear to God I'll try
'Cause if you'll give me half a chance I'll love you like I should
Honey, your lovin' man's come home again
And that stranger's gone for good
The man that came between us was looking out for number one
He didn't care how bad he hurt you by the selfish things he'd done
But looking in the mirror, today, I finally came to seed
That man that came between us was me
Oh honey, the man that came between us was meBlue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and proved untrue
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
It was on a moonlight night
The stars were shining bright
And they whispered from on high
Your love has said good-bye
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and said good-bye
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and proved untrue
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
It is on a moonlight night
The stars shining bright
They whispered from high
Your love has said good-bye
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and said good-byeDance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
And dance me to the end of love
Please dance me to the end of love
Oh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
Oh let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Oh show me slowly what I only know the limits of
And dance me to the end of love
Please dance me to the end of love
La la, la la la, la la, la la la, la la, la la la
Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
And dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
We're both of us beneath our love, and both of us above
And dance me to the end of love
Won't you dance me to the end of loveBaby can't you feel that
Baby don't you hear that
That's the sound freedom calling our name
It's telling us that all we gotta do is turn the key
Let this feeling carry us away
Baby lets ride
Chase a little sunset
Watch that full moon rise
Baby lets ride
Find some road where there ain't no end in sight
Let the wheels of this RAM truck kick up a little dust while your holding on tight
Come on!
Baby lets ride
Girl you know the night is young
No reason not to run
A few miles of memories down this road
Baby we don't need a map
Pick a star we'll follow that
What are we waitin on girl lets go
Baby lets ride
Chase a little sunset
Watch that full moon rise
Baby lets ride
Find some road where there ain't no end in sight
Let the wheels of this RAM truck kick up a little dust while your holding on tight
Come on!
Baby lets ride
This is how you got me feelin right now
Baby lets ride
Don't look back it'll never come down
Let the wheels of this RAM truck kick up a little dust while your holding on tight
Come on!
Baby lets rideYou say you love me and its inviting, to go where life is more exciting
But I was raised on country sunshine
I was raised on country sunshine, green grass beneath my feet
Running through the fields of daisies, wading through the creek
You love me and its inviting, to go where life is more exciting
But I was raised on country sunshine
I was raised on country sunshine, I'm happy with the simple things
A Saturday night dance, a picture show and the joy that a bluebird brings
I love you please believe me, I won't want you to ever leave me
But I was raised on country sunshine
There's just something bout the morning that make each day a joy to see
The nighttime brings a peaceful feeling that rests inside of me
I love you please believe me, I won't want you to ever leave me
But I was raised on country sunshine
You love me and its inviting, to go where life is more exciting
But I was raised on country sunshine
Mmm, mmm I was raised on country sunshine
Oh, oh I was raised on country sunshine
Mmm, mmm I was raised on country sunshineNever thought too much about her leavin'
I'd find someone there was no doubt
But this time the feelin' is strange and different
Since she's been gone there's one thing I found out
[Chorus]
It takes a mighty man to live with lonesome
Some big men might live with misery
But there's one thing I know, for sure it's certain
It's for sure it's gonna take a lot bigger man than me
I've never suffered much in the hurtin' line
I've always been as good as any man
But show me who can lose in love and like it
And I'll be the first to proudly shake his handOnce a day every day all day long
When I found somebody new I thought I never would
Forget you for I thought then I never could
But time has taken all the pains away until now I'm down to hurtin' once a day
Once a day all day long and once a night from dusk till dawn
The only time I wish you weren't gone is once a day every day all day long
[ steel ]
I'm so glad that I'm not like a boy I knew one time
He lost the girl he loved then slowly lost his mind
He sat around and cried his life away well lucky me I'm down to crying once a day
Once a day all day long...
Once a day every day all day longTo my first pony, Cherry Pie
From the little girl you taught to fly
To the sun
To Misses Thorton, from third grade
I remember all the times you stayed
Till Daddy picked me up
Oh, did you ever know?
Did I ever tell you so?
Oh I hope you understand
You have so much to do with who I am
To my older brother, Wes
I worshiped everything you did and said
I hope it didn't bother you
To Grandma Melva and Grandpa Lin,
What I'd give just to be five again
Singin' in your living room
Oh, did you ever know?
Did I ever tell you so?
Oh, I hope you understand
You have so much to do with who I am
To Arkansas summer wind,
To feelings that never end
To anyone who called me friend
All the blessings from above
To Mama's kiss and Daddy's hugs
I didn't say it near enough
Thank you for who I am
Oh, did you ever know?
Did I ever tell you so?
Oh, I hope you understand
You have so much
You have so much to do with who I am
To my first pony, Cherry Pie
From the little girl you taught to fly
You taught to flyOn top of old Smokey all covered with snow
I lost my true lover for courtin' too slow
Oh courtin's a pleasure parting is grief
And a false hearted lover is worse than a thief
A thief will just rob you take all that you have
But false hearted lovers take you to your grave
The grave will decay you turn you into dust
And it just isn't one girl a poor boy can trust
[ steel ]
So come all you lovers and listen to me
Don't place your affection on a green willow tree
The leaves will all wither the roots will all die
Then you'll be forgotten but you'll never know why
On top of old Smokey all covered with snow
I lost my true lover for a courtin' too slowEverybody says you let me down I should be ashamed to take you round
Makes no difference what you used to do darling I could never be ashamed of you
Maybe you were reckless yesterday but together we can find a brighter way
In my heart I know that you'll come true darling I could never be ashamed of you
[ steel ]
All the happiness I've ever known came the day you said you'd be my own
And it matters not what we go through darling I could never be ashamed of you
Maybe you were cheated in the past and perhaps those memories will always last
Even though you prove to be untrue darling I could never be ashamed of youWe all loved our fair tender maiden
From her eyes the light of Heaven shone through
She fell sick one cold winter morning
And there was nothing we could do
She lay on her death bed so bravely
Her face all tired and worn
We knew in our hearts she was leaving
God had called her to His heavenly home
As she lay on the bed she was smiling
At the people all gathered a-round
It was her only way of saying goodbye
And tomorrow she'd lay neath the ground
The fragrance of flowers from her grave
Goes to heaven where she has gone too
Mortal pain shown on all our faces
But there was nothing we could doBORN TO RUN
Well I never did crawl and I never did toe the line
No man is a master to me, I ain't that kind
I just put on my travelin' shoes
If you wanna win you just can't lose the time
Or stay behind
Well I was born to run
To get ahead of the rest
And all that I wanted was to be the best
Just to feel free and be someone
I was born to be fast I was born to run
Well I take the chances for the time I made mistakes
But you don't get nothin' unless you take the breaks
Livin' as dangerous as dynamite
Sure it makes you feel nervous but it makes you feel
alright
Makes you feel alrightI can see the sunshine again
And I can see the blue sky where there once was fog and rain
We know each other now clear through and through
The fog has lifted between me and you
I loved you the first time I saw you
For it seemed like I had known you all my life
Well I loved you too but it takes a long time
To know what hurts you what helps you and know how you feel deep inside
I'm so happy you found out before it was too late
Our beautiful love could have turned into hate
Forgiving and understanding gives us a clear view
The fog has lifted between me and you
Now there's the sunshine again...(Ron Agnew)
Jimmy Joe left the mountain 'bout seven months ago,
When the autumn nights turned cool
Chasin' a dream, like they say
Just goin' away to school
An' though he loved Amy more'n anything else,
He felt he just had to go, and make his way
An' Amy felt pretty close to dyin' when Jimmy left
That September day
Y'see, there was somethin' she had to tell him,
But the words were never found
An' as they stood there by the garden gate,
Jimmy picked a wildflower from the ground
As he placed it in Amy's hand an' kissed her,
An' her fingers touched the dew,
He wiped her tears away and told her he'd be back
Not knowin' what she knew
[Chorus]
Watch the wildwood flowers for me
And I'll watch my dreams for you
And I promise that I'll write you everyday
And when the winter snow is gone
Touch the flowers as they grow
And when the first one blooms then I'll be on my way
Well, Jimmy Joe never wrote those letters
An' through the winter, Amy's hopes grew dim
As she felt the life inside her stir
An' she watched the flowers grow, for him
Last spring Jimmy Joe came home, too late
He found that Amy'd gone away
An' died givin' life to his baby boy
An' he recalled what he had said that September day
[Chorus]
Watch the wildwood flowers for me
And I'll watch my dreams for you
And when the first one blooms then I'll be on my way
Watch the wildwood flowers for me
And I'll watch my dreams for you
And when the first one blooms then I'll be on my way
And when the first one blooms then I'll be on my wayWRITER TIM WILLIAMS
DAY BY DAY
SEEMS LIKE YOU DRIFT AWAY
MAYBE IT'S JUST A PHASE
BUT IT WON'T TAKE A LOT
TO PUT OUT THIS FIRE WE'VE GOT
WHAT'S LEFT JUST DON'T SEEM SO HOT
IT FLICKERS AND STRAINS
WAITS FOR THE RAiN
AS IT FADES FROM A FIRE
TO A DYING FLAME, AND IT LOOKS
LIKE RAIN
5EE THE CLOUDS IN THE SKY
THEY DON'T EVEN SEEM TO MIND
IT WILL DIE DON'T THEY KNOW
FEEL THE WIND BEGIN TO BLOW
SOON IT WILL BRING THE RAIN
WASH IT ALL AWAYAlright, alright
Yeah it's alright, alright
Don't need no five star reservations
I've got spaghetti and a cheap bottle of wine
Don't need no concert in the city
I've got a stereo and the best of Patsy Cline
Ain't got no caviar no Dom Perignon
But as far as I can see, I've got everything I want
Cause I've got a roof over my head,
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I've got shoes under my feet
Forever in her eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright
And I've got all I need
And it's alright by me
Maybe later on we'll walk down to the river
Lay on a blanket and stare up at the moon
It may not be no French Riviera
But it's all the same to me as long as I'm with you
It may be a simple life, but that's okay
If you ask me baby, I think I've got it made
Cause I've got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I've got shoes under my feet
Forever in her eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright
And I've got all I need
And it's alright by me
It's alright by me, yeah yeah
When I lay down at night I thank the Lord above
For giving me everything I ever could dream of
Cause I've got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright, alright, alright
I've got shoes under my feet
Forever in her eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright, alright
And I've got all I need, yeah
I've got all I need
And it's alright by me
Oh yeah, it's alright by meLove is like a butterfly
As soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing
I feel it when you're with me
It happens when you kiss me
That rare and gentle feeling that I feel inside
Your touch is soft and gentle
Your kiss is warm and tender
Whenever I am with you I think of butterflies
Love is like a butterfly
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing
Your laughter brings me sunshine
Everyday is spring time
And I am only happy when you are by my side
How precious is this love we share
How very precious, sweet and rare
Together we belong like daffodils and butterflies
Love is like a butterfly
As soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing(Dolly Parton)
Back through the years I go wondering once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mamma put these rags to use
There were rags of many colours, and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Mamma sewed the rags together, sewing ever piece with love
She made my coat of many colours, that I was so proud of
As she sewed she told the story from the bible she had read
About a coat of many colours, Joseph wore and they she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you, much love and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it, and mamma blessed it with a kiss
My coat of many colours that mamma made for me
Made only rags, but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money. oh I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me
So with patches on my breaches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colours, I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and makin' fun of me
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me
Oh, I couldn't understand it, for I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love my mamma sewed in ever stitch
And I told them all the story, mamma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colours is worth more than all of their clothes
They didn't under stand it and I tried to make them see
That one is only poor only if they choose to be
Now I know we have no money, but I'm as rich as I could be
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me
In my coat of many colours, my mamma just made for meShe's sun and rain, she's fire and ice
A little crazy but it's nice
And when she gets mad, you best leave her alone
'Cause she'll rage just like a river
Then she'll beg you to forgive her
She's every woman that I've ever known
She's so New York and then L.A.
And every town along the way
She's every place that I've never been
She's making love on rainy nights
She's a stroll through Christmas lights
And she's everything I want to do again
It needs no explanation
'Cause it all makes perfect sense
When it comes down to temptation
She's on both sides of the fence
No it needs no explanation
'Cause it all makes perfect sense
When it comes down to temptation
She's on both sides of the fenceI thought I had seen pretty girls in my time
But that was before I met you
I never saw one that I wanted for mine
But that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you
I thought I'd stay single always be free
But that was before I met you
I said that no sweet thang could ever hold me
But that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you
That was before I met youAll you know it all lovers better heed some advice,
If you're bad to your baby, you'd better think twice.
Love don't come easy, love ain't blind.
You've got to show her you love her, morning and night,
Be there for her just to make things right.
Make her believe till there ain't a doubt in her mind.
Better baby your baby with a love that's strong,
Hold her and tell her you'll never do wrong.
Better baby your baby, ?cause if you don't
One day your baby?ll be gone.
Don't let her get lonely, don't make her cry,
Don't take her for granted, don't tell her a lie.
Bring her red roses when she's blue.
Give her the best of what you've got to give,
You'll be together as long as you live,
Better baby your baby, she?ll baby you.
Better baby your baby with a love that's strong,
Hold her and tell her you'll never do wrong.
Better baby your baby, ?cause if you don't
One day your baby?ll be gone.Got a mountain of love for the girl in the valley
Got an ocean of dreams for the girl in the valley
Someday I will marry the girl in the valley
Cause this mountain boy holds a world full of joy
For the girl in the valley
She's a sweet little thing that lives by the spring in the valley
Every day she goes by with her head held up high like a high steppin' Philly
I tried every thing even bought her a ring she won't wear it
She said she loves me but she's not yet quite ready to marry.
Got a mountainFINAL EXAMINATION
WITH DOTTIE WEST
(Red Lane - Dottie West)
You reset with the love that has built to stand on its own
Somewhere we surely went wrong
So let's study our hearts we may learn we might change our minds
A final examination to test our situation may find love is not really gone
We've been countin' our sorrows and forgettin' all the good times we had
And somewhere love left us alone
So let's count on each other and together we might make the grade
A final examination to test our situation may find love is not really gone
We've been countin' our sorrows...Now when I left the old home I wasn't satisfied
When I kissed mother goodbye I thought she hung her head and cried
I hear the Special comin' and I'll be on the line
When she pulls out for Dixie on that Mason Dixon Line
[ fiddle ]
I know a girl in Dixie she was my childhood pal
She said if I quit bummin' Lord she would be my gal
I hear the Special...
[ dobro ]
At night I think about her she's always on my mind
And when we played together Lord she was so good and kind
I hear the Special...The bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
The cabarets and honky tonks their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights
(Lights that say forget her name) in a glass of cherry wine
(Lights that offer other girls) for empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights
The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
Did the God who put those stars above make those city lights
Did he make a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right
Are we just supposed to run and hide behind those city lights
(Lights that say forget her love) in a different atmosphere
(Lights that lure are nothing) but a masquarade for tears
They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
And I just can't say I love you to a street of city lightsWalking in circles cause she wouldn't pick up the phone
I'm not so sure that she's capable of being alone
I can't get me to her to tell her that everything's fine
If she'd answer, I'd send her my love over telephone lines
Well we don't change the past cause it's already written, I know
But sometimes it feels like the future is coming so slow
I can't speed things up and I surely cant hold back time
If she'd answer, I'd send her my love over telephone lines
It's raining in Boston tonight
Stars are hiding in my sky
All of her secrets are locked up in her head
Launch me from a cannon into the sky
I would fall right into her bed
Morning would find me in her eyes
Well I leave this old place and I stumble out into the street
I paint her face on every lady I meet
Rain hits the pavement, it drops from above in my eyes
If she'd answer, I'd send her my love over telephone lines
It's raining in Boston tonight
Stars are hiding in my sky
All of her secrets are locked up in her head
Launch me from a cannon into the sky
I would fall right into her bed
Morning would find me in her eyes
Launch me from a cannon into the sky
Lady
Please don't forget
Lady
Please don't forget
Lady
Please don't forget me nowMy buddy Blake was all-state with dreams of the NFL
Jenny McClain had big brains
She got a scholarship to Yale
And there was Hershel who did two commercials
And he was going to be a movie star
But all I wanted was a car
All I wanted was a car
Part time job making chicken kabobs at the food court at the mall
I hauled my uncle's trash
I cut my neighbor's grass
And I raked the leaves in the fall
My parents they were stunned how this former lazy bum was suddenly working so hard
But all I wanted was a car
All I wanted was a car
Yeah when I was sixteen all of my dreams revolved around one thing
All I wanted was a car
All I wanted was a car
When I finally got that big hunk of steel
Those four wheels underneath
I went everywhere in it
Broke the speed limit
And I even broke in the backseat
Now when I look outside sitting in the drive
It blows my mind to see an SUV and a sedan
And two kids playing and I can't believe they all belong to me
When I caught my mama's eye in that thing I used to drive
I never dreamed it would take me this far
All I wanted was a car
Sixteen all of my dreams revolved around one thing
All I wanted was a car
All I wanted was a car
All I wanted was a car
All I wanted was a car
All I wanted was a carThe Gods were angry with me for loving you
The Gods were angry with me because they knew
I stood at heaven's portal and that was too high for any model such as I
So they took down the sun the skies were gray
Then the howling winds took you away
And there was nothing I could do
Because I knew the Gods were angry with me for loving you
Once upon a time when our love was new
And I was happy with the love that I've found
Then the Gods and the sun and the moon and the stars looked down
And saw me there with you
And they sent my dream world crash into the ground
(It was because the Gods were angry with me)
The Gods were angry with meEvery woman wants, every woman needs
What everybody thinks is impossible,
Unachievable
A man who is strong, admits he's wrong
Laughs along
And is up for anything and everything
A lot of heart, not afraid to try a little
Tenderness
All my friends used to say where you ever
Gonna find a man like this
Well I got him
[Chorus]
He's mine
He makes me feel like a real live woman
Inside
Funny how a little love can get you so
High
Can't wait to get my hands on him
Tonight, tonight
He's mine
The way he looks at me, across a crowded
Room, doesn't say a word
Man that moves me, that man loves me
He takes me in his arms, I open up my heart,
It's like the waters part
And it's just him and me, nothing in between
Just when I think it's never gonna get any
Better than this
He touches me tenderly and we melt together
In a long slow kiss
[Chorus]Look at us here, sittin' around pissed off at the world
Pretending to drown a memory and fix reality
Afraid to admit, here in the bar
We're pieces of shit, pretend we aren't what we are
It's sad, tonight I've got it bad
But there's nothin' I can do
And there's nothin' you can say
Somebody hurt me, somebody hurt you
Last call, we all fall down
A haunted family, we all belong to
Last call, we all fall down
Some drink redemption, some take the pills
Crazy Jake in the corner runs a special on thrills
A means to an end, everybody's best friend
Maybe somebody ran out, maybe you pushed them away
Maybe you caught her on top when you came home early today
I know, I know
But there's nothin' I can do
And there's nothin' you can say
Somebody hurt me, somebody hurt you
Last call, we all fall down
A haunted family, we all belong to
Last call, we all fall down
Sitting here screamin' not makin' a sound
There's a slow rolling darkness on the edge of town
We'll make it through somehow
We've got each other now
Somebody hurt me, somebody hurt you
Last call, we all fall down
A haunted family, we all belong to
Last call, we all fall down
Last call, we all fall down
Last call, we all fall downI was born one mornin',
The rain a-pourin' down,
Heard my mammy say to my pappy,
"Let's call him John Henry Brown."
[Chorus]
Walk on, boy; walk on down the road;
Ain't nobody in this whole wide world
A-gonna help you carry your load.
I left my mammy and pappy
Just about the age of ten;
Lord, I got me a job a-workin' on the levee
Totin' water for the hard workin' men.
[Chorus]
One day my pappy told me,
"Some advice I wanna give to you
Son, find a good woman, be good to her,
An' she's gonna be good to you."
[Chorus]
If anyone should ever ask you,
"Just who is that fella Brown?"
You can tell him I'm the boy
Who left his hammer smokin'
Where he beat that steam drill down.
[Chorus]
Walk on, boy; walk on down the road;
There ain't nobody in this whole wide world
A-gonna help you carry your load.
Walk on boy, walk on boy,
Walk on, boy.Hush a bye my baby slumber time is coming soon
Rest your head upon my breast while mommie hums a tune
The sandman is calling when shadows are falling
While the soft breezes sigh as in days long gone by
Way down in Missouri where I heard this melody
When I was a little feller on my mommie's knee
The old folks were humming the banjos were strumming so sweet and low
[ guitar ]
Hush a bye my baby go to sleep on mommie's knee
Journey back to Dixie Land in dreams again with me
It seems like your mommie was there once again
And the old folks were strumming that same old refrain
Way down in Missouri where I learned this lullaby
When the stars were blinking and the moon was standing high
And I hear mommie clove as in days long ago singing hush a bye singing hush a byeIf you're lost and you're alone
Let me sing you a song
Oh, you're not the only lonely one tonight
I know what you're goin' through
I can sympathize with you
I've been wakin' in your shoes all my life
I was born with a broken heart
Born to lose right from the start
Raised on hand-me-down blues
That's why I sing the way I do
A sad six-string, and a jukebox voice
I'm the lonely people's choice
I was made to play the part
I was born with a broken heart
If the sun should ever shine in your life
Well, friend, that's fine
And may you leave behind these
Old troubled times that we've shared
Oh, but don't look back for me
I'm where I'm supposed to be
And anywhere there's a lonely street, I'll be there
I was born with a broken heart
Born to lose right from the start
Raised on hand-me-down blues
That's why I sing the way I do
A sad six-string, and a jukebox voice
I'm the lonely people's choice
I was made to play the part
I was born with a broken heart
Yes, I was made to play the part
I was born with a broken heartMcKinley hollered, McKinley squalled
Doc said, "McKinley I can't find the cause
You're bound to die, you're bound to die"
Doc told the horse, he'd throw down his rein
He said to the horse, "You gotta outrun the train
From Buffalo to Washington"
The Doc came a-running, he took off his specs
He said, "Mr McKinley better cash in your checks
You've bound to die, you're bound to die"
Look here, you rascal, you see what you've done
You shot my husband and I've got your gun
I'm carrying you back, to Washington(Dolly Parton)
He is high and mighty
He is high and mighty
He is there and ever waiting
Reaching out to you and me
He is high and mighty
Oh, mighty is His power
Mighty is His love
He is high and mighty
He is there with the answers
Let us lift Him up
God loves you, did you know that?
Ain't it good to know he cares
If you're burdened down with troubles
Just go to Him in prayer
Say God, I'm just a seeker
I'm empty, scared and lost
Then lay your burdens down
At the foot of the cross
He said ye shall know the truth
And the truth shall set you free
He will guide and lead you
And fulfill every need
Nothing is impossible
If you have faith enough
So if you've lost direction
Stop and just look up
'Cause He is high and mighty
Ooh, mighty is His power, mighty is His love
He is high and mighty
He is life everlasting
Let us lift Him up
High and mighty
He is high and mighty
I believe, I do believe
That His love has set me free
I believe, I believe, I believe
He is high and mighty
Oh, mighty is His power, mighty is His love
He is high and He's mighty
It's a wonderful feeling
Let us lift Him up
He said if I be lifted up
He said if I be lifted up
What did He say?
He said if I be lifted up
I'll draw all the men unto me
Let's lift him higher, higher
Higher and higher each day
Let's lift Him up
'Cause He is high and He's mighty
And He has washed my sins away
'Cause He's high and He's mightyI blew out all my plans
The world fell in my hands
The day that I began
Trying to love you
The secrets I have kept
The nights I haven't slept
I've laughed until I've wept
Trying to love you
Trying to love you... No one's come as close or gone so far
Trying to love you... I've lost and found myself in who you are
Trying to love you... So easy and so hard, trying to love you
I've watched myself get stuck
Squandered all my luck
But I cannot give up
Trying to love you
Trying to love you... It broke my heart, it's chipped away my pride
Trying to love you... Everytime I'd see that faultline slide
Trying to love you... I've crossed the great divide trying to love you
[Instrumental Break]
Trying to love you... I've screamed your name, I've slammed a thousand doors
Trying to love you... I've worn a million miles across the floor
Trying to love you... Still I could not ignore trying to love you
It's pulled the best from me
For all the world to see
And I will always be
Trying to love youThe moon is full and my arms are empty
All night long I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that you would leave
Would be a cold day in July
Your bags are packed not a word is spoken
I guess we said everything with good-bye
Time moves so slow and promises get broken
On this cold day in July
Sun's comin' up comin' up down on Main Street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands here I am
Standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away
You said that we were gonna last forever
You said our love would never die
It looks like spring and
It feels like sunny weather
But it's a cold day in July
Sun's comin' up comin' up down on Main Street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands here I am
Standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away
The moon is full my arms are empty
All night long how I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that you would leave me
Would be a cold day in July
Here comes that cold day in JulyON MY WAY TO YOU
THERE WAS THIS GIRL IN ALBUQUERQUE
I DON'T THINK SHE REALLY MEANT TO HURT ME
BUT SHE DID
SO WHAT DID I DO
MOVED IN WITH A GIRL IN KNEW FROM COLLEGE
IF LOVED WALKED AWAY I NEVER SAW IT
BUT SHE DID
A LOT OF LITTLE THINGS FELL THROUGH
ON MY WAY TO YOU
I HURT I WALKED
I RAN I CRAWLED
LET LOVE MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A FOOL
I LOST SOME TIME
SPUN THESE WHEELS OF MINE
SEARCHIN' FOR THE TRUTH
ON MY WAY TO YOU
ON MY WAY TO YOU
I ONLY MADE ONE RIGHT DECISION
I LEARNED WHAT REAL LOVE IS AND ISN'T
IN YOUR ARMS
MY AIM WAS TRUE
TRUE AND HONEST AS YOUR BLUE EYES
THAT LED ME ALL THE WAY THAT ONE NIGHT
TO YOUR HEART
LOST MY WAY A TIME OR TWO
ON MY WAY TO YOU
CHORUSI know the reasons why you're not here with me
But I told you I'd survive if you ever had to leave
But in the light of day, I tend to do okay
But when the night takes hold, I think of you
And I go crazy from the heart
I reach out to touch you
But you're nowhere in the dark
My mind knows why we're apart
But I go crazy
Crazy from the heart
In my mind there's no doubt we could not make it last
But I've learned to live without a love that's in the past
But in the night so still, her memories feel so real
They make my blood run cold. I reach for you
And I go crazy from the heart
I reach out to touch you,
But you're nowhere in the dark
My mind knows why we're apart
But I go crazy,
Crazy from the heart
When the moon takes hold
(When the moon takes hold)
The stars come out and I lose controlYou tell me you love her with all of your heart
And there's no room left there for me
But someday if she'll hurt you and your whole world falls apart
I'll take a left over corner of your heart
Just a left over corner of a heart not much as true
But it just goes to show how much I want you
For I'd give my heart full of true love for tiny little start
In that left over corner of your heart
[ strings ]
Just a left over corner...Fancy satin pillows that you bought for me to place beneath my head
I must admit they're very nice but I would rather have your arms instead
To have you here beside me and to feel your warmth so very close is what I need
More than all the fancy satin pillows you could ever buy for me
Still I thank you for the fancy satin pillows I don't mean to be unkind
But I can't use 'em both and I thought sharing them was what you had in mind
In the stillness of the night to have your arms reach out and pull me close so tenderly
Means more than all the fancy satin pillows you could ever buy for me
[ guitar ]
Still I thank you for...
Means more than all the fancy satin pillows you could ever buy for meI dreamed I was there in hillbilly heaven oh what a beautiful sight
And I met all the stars in hillbilly heaven oh what a star spangled night
Last night I dreamed I went to hillbilly heaven
And just as I arrived the old curtain lifted
And there on stage stood who else but Roy Acuff and Tex Ritter
They said well how you doing come on in here
I know there's some folks you want to see
Over there's our newest member your old friend Conway Twitty say Hello Darlin'
And there's gentlemen Jim Reeves singin' with heaven's choir
Roger Miller he just got here he's making everybody laugh
Course you know Roy Orbison can sing just as high as anybody here
And Ernest Tubb can sing as low
And Patsy Cline well bet she's the best singin' angel here
And Dottie West is probably the prettiest
There's the old pea-picker Ernie Ford
Jimmy Rodgers George Morgan Hank Williams
And the wandering boy Web Pierce
The old honky tonker himself Lefty Frizzell
My goodness what a group
Would you just listen to Mother Mabel
Over there pickin' the Wildwood Flower with the angel band
You know I personally think she's just about God's favorite
And Marty Robbins well he's still gettin' more encores than anybody else up here
Just like he used to down on earth
Yeah well there's Elvis they still call him the King
But we know they're not talking about the real king up here
I dreamed I went to hillbilly heaven oh what a star studded night
Then I ask Roy and Tex I said well who do you think will be showin' up
Say within the next 40 50 60 years
They handed me a big tallybook and in it I saw names like Johnny Cash
George Jones Merle Haggard Don Gibson Mel Tillis Farren Young Kitty Wells
Some of the newer ones like Vince Gill and Garth Brooks
Course they talked about Minnie Pearl the Judds Tanya Tucker Reba McEntire Hank Jr
Oh of course Buck Owens Roy Rodgers Gene Autry Randy Travis and Willie Nelson
There's old Chet
I said well where's Porter Wagoner's name oh there it is
And then there was Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette and Dolly Parton
Oooh that's when I woke up
I dreamed I was there in hillbilly heaven oh what a beautiful sight
And I met all the stars in hillbilly heaven oh what a star spangled nightI used to cry over you
I lost my heart and there was nothin' I could do
I couldn't smile when you would leave
If you were mad I couldn't find the strength to breathe
I used to pine for what we had
I woke up hurtin' in my heart for you so bad
A stronger love had never been
I used to miss you and all the times we spent
Not anymore, not now, you tore my heart out
Gave me up and brought me down
You set me free, walked out the door
I used to need you to be happy, not anymore
Time heals everything
You almost killed me when you left and now I sing
I think of you now and then
But you'll never get the chance to break my heart againÃ meu defeito, eu bebo mesmo

When I think of those days gone by it brings forth a tear;
Where tales of the rugged frontier and Old West is a familiar story,
that brings with it the adventures of the cowboy and the wide open range, with all its glory;
Where the good guy always wins and the bad guy ends up" six feet under" if you will;
Oh, the tales that could be told of those buried out on Boot Hill;
Those were the days when the bad men of the West came up against the law,
Most often met their demise at the hands of someone quicker on the draw;
Those were times when the prairies were bridled with danger,
Danger for the outlaw who fought against the likes of the Lone Ranger;
Where every town in the West had more than its share of villains,
who were quickly put to rest by the tough and courageous Matt Dillons;
Oh how I miss those wonderful days of the Old West,
When courage and justice were put to the test;
Where memories of boyhood heroes are forever etched in my mind,
Reflections of Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, and the Hopalong Cassidy kind;
For me the agelessness of the American Cowboy is a sure bet,
as sure as John Wayne riding out into the western sunset;
What happened to those glorious Westerns of yesteryear.I stopped at a road house in Texas a little place called Hamburger Dan's
Heard that old jukebox a playin' song about a truck drivin' man
The waitress then brought me up some coffee
I thanked her then called her back again
I said that old song sure does fit me cause I'm a truck drivin' man
Pour me another cup of coffee for it is the best in the land
Put a nickel in the jukebox and play the Truck Drivin' Man
[ steel - fiddle ]
I climbed back aboard my old semi and then like a flash I was gone
I got them old truck wheels a rolling now I'm on my way to San Antone
When I get my call up to glory they'll take me away from this land
I'll head this old truck up to heaven cause I'm a truck drivin' man
Pour me another cup of coffee...
And play the Truck Drivin' ManI left home when I was twenty
Just to see what I could find
With a promise made to Mother
To return at Christmas time
But when the new year turned to summer
I was running rough and wild
Haunted by my broken promise
And her tender, trusting smile
Sick at heart I started homeward
Still it took a year and more
Till I saw the garden flowers
Leading to my mother's door
Brother, sister standing silent
Turning as I call their names
On the ground, familiar shadows
Pointing to a new dug graveIf I could paint pictures I'd paint one for you
A picture portraying the love we once knew
Then a tear would reveal the sorrow in me
As I painted white fences and evergreen trees
Love can be greater than the mountains or seas
But it's only as great as two hearts believe
Faith blew away in yesterdays breeze
And we lost our white fences and evergreen trees
[ piano ]
I've walked through a valley and cried all night long
In search for the reason why true love goes wrong
With a prayer on my lips the earth touching my knees
I prayed for white fences and evergreen trees
Love can be greater...Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by you can stay the night beside her
And you know she's half crazy but that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China
Just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wave length and she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover
And you want to travel with her and you want to travel blind
And you know she will trust you
'Cause you've touched her perfect body with your mind
And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time searching from his lonely wooden tower
And just when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him
He said all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them
But he himself was broken long before the sky would open
Forsaken almost human he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
And you want to travel with him and you want to travel blind
And you think may be you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind
Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river
She's weaving rags and feathers from salvation army counters
And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbour
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed there are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror
And you want to travel with her and you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mindIf I drove a truck
And I were waitress
And I ordered coffee
And I poured you some
Then you'd stop by
On your way sometime later
And if we arm-wrestled
I'd say that you won
My baby, ride easy
Ride high in the saddle all day
If your lovin' is good
And your cookin' ain't greasy
Hitch up the chuck wagon
And we'll ride away
If I were a winsome pale senorita
And I a bull-fighter, down in the sand
While the band kept on playing
That old Paso Doble
I'd throw you a flower
Would you take my hand?
My baby, ride easy
Ride high in the saddle all day
If your lovin' is good
And your cookin' ain't greasy
Hitch up the chuck wagon
And we'll ride away
If I ran the country
Yeah, I'd be your first lady
And fix up the white house
While you were away
Waitin' while I'm passing time
With world leaders
And later, together alone we might lay
My baby, ride easy
Ride high in the saddle all day
If your lovin' is good
And your cookin' ain't greasy
Hitch up the chuck wagon
And we'll ride away
My baby, ride easy
Ride high in the saddle all day
If your lovin' is good
And your cookin' ain't greasy
Hitch up the chuck wagon
And we'll ride away
Hitch up the chuck wagon
And we'll ride away
Hitch up the chuck wagon
And we'll ride away
Hitch up the chuck wagon
Hitch up the chuck wagon
Hitch up the chuck wagon
And we'll ride awayI was waltzing by the Ohio, river of dreams,
With the girl of my dreams in my arms
And the music, beautiful music,
Was the breeze through the trees
As the moonlight came over her charms.
We promised to always be faithful and true
But we drifted apart,
Now I'm lonesome and blue
And an other is waltzing by the river of dreams
With the girl of my dreams in his arms.There's a slow moon rising
It's shining on your skin
The way your body moves me
I know there's no holding back
No holding back
I wouldn't be a man
If I didn't feel like this
I wouldn't be a man
If a woman like you
Was anything I could resist
I'd have to be from another planet
Where love doesn't exist
I wouldn't be a man
If I didn't feel like this
I can feel passion flowing
As you fall into my arms
The secret way you touch me
Tells me there's no holding back
No holding back
I wouldn't be a man
If I didn't feel like this
I wouldn't be a man
If a woman like you
Was anything I could resist
I'd have to be from another planet
Where love doesn't exist
I wouldn't be a man
If I didn't feel like this
Roll with me, baby
All night long
Soul to soul with me, baby
All night long
I'd have to be from another planet
Where love doesn't exist
I wouldn't be a man
If I didn't feel like thisWhat a gray, cloudy mornin' I rise from my bed
And I wonder if he meant all the things that he said
Well I think of all the good times, but the bad times came along
Now it doesn't matter 'cause he's gone.
Now I'm alone again, I cry in my sleep
I wonder why he left, his love I tried to keep
I don't understand him and I guess I never will
He could always make my heart stand still
He may not have loved me, or cared for me at all
But through all the teardrops, he sure made me fall
And when we were together, my world was in a spin
I will never love him again
Now I'm alone again, I cry in my sleep
I wonder why he left, his love I tried to keep
I don't understand him and I guess I never will
He could always make my heart stand still
Yes he could always make my heart stand stillIt's twilight and the streets
Light are coming on
I'm in a stream of cars
On this Boulevard, headed home
I can hardly wait
You can make what went wrong today
Seam right
Bring on the night
It's been a long hard day
So bring on the night
Bring on the night
And pull down the shades
Lock the world out side
And throw the key away
Turn on the feelings
And turn out the lights
Lets call it a day
And bring on the night
From nine to five it's the same ole grind
All week long
And the only thing
That keeps sane, is coming home
When the sun goes down
You know how to set things right
Lets put the day behind us
And bring on the night
Bring on the night
And pull down the shades
Lock the world out side
And throw the key away
Turn on the feelings
And turn out the lights
Lets call it a day
And bring on the nightDon't get weary, don't get weary children
Don't get weary, I'm coming from the ball
Nashville full of big hotels,
Chattanooga full of saloons
Knoxville full of republicans
And Memphis loves the Blues
Don't get weary, don't get weary children
Don't get weary, I'm coming from the ball
Wish I had a sugar rump,
Sugar by the pound
Great big bowl to stir it in
Pretty gal to hand it around
Don't get weary, don't get weary children
Don't get weary, I'm coming from the ball
Big bee sucks the blossom,
Little bee makes the honey
Poor man picks cotton and corn,
Rich man see the money
Don't get weary, don't get weary children
Don't get weary, I'm coming from the ball
Daddy had a big ole gal;
He brought her from the South
Hair so curly on her head,
She could not shut her mouth
Don't get weary, don't get weary children
Don't get weary, I'm coming from the ball
People on the corner
Watching us go by
Could not see us very long,
'Cause Bobtail, he could fly(Nancy Griffith)
I am a backseat driver from america
They drive to the left on falls road
And the man at the wheels name is Shamus
We pass a the child on a corner he knows.
And shamus says now what chance has that kid got
And I say from the back I don't know
He says there's barbed wire at all of these exits
There ain't no place in Belfast for that kid to go.
And it's a hard life, it's a hard life
It's a very hard life, it's a hard life wherever you go
And we poison our children with hatred
And the hard life is all that they know.
--- Instrumental ---
At the dairyline in Chicago
A fat man in front of me
He's calling black people trash to his children
He's the only trash here I see.
And I'm thinking this man wears a white hood
In the night when his children should sleep
But they'll slip to their windows and see him
They'll think that white hood's all they need.
And it's a hard life, it's a hard life
It's a very hard life, it's a hard life wherever you go
And we poison our children with hatred
And the hard life is all that they know.
--- Instrumental ---
I was a child of the sixties
When dreams could be held through tears
With Disney and Cronkite and Martin Luther
And I belived, I believed, I believed.
Now I'm a backseat driver from America
And I'm not at the wheel of control
And I am guilty, I am worn, I am the root of all evil
And I can't drive on the left side of the road.
And it's a hard life, it's a hard life
It's a very hard life, it's a hard life wherever you go
And we poison our children with hatred
And the hard life is all that they know.
And there ain't no place in this world for these kids to go
'Cause it's a hard life wherever you go...

Abraham, Martin and John
(Richard Holler)
Has anybody here seen my old friend Abraham
Can you tell me where he's gone
He freed a lotta people but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and he's gone.
Has anybody here seen my old friend Martin
Can you tell me where he's gone
He freed a lotta people but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and he's gone.
Has anybody here seen my old friend John
Can you tell me where he's gone
He freed a lotta people but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and he's gone.
Didn't you love the things they stood for
Didn't they try to find some good
In you and me and we'll be free
Someday soon it's gonna be one day.
Has anybody here seen my old friend Bobby
can you tell me where he's gone
I thought I saw him walking up over the hill
With Abraham and Martin and John...They say there he sits in his big white wicker rocker
Eatin' candy coated cashews sippin' orange lemonade
While a sweet young thing fans the flies from off his eyebrows
He's dozin' in the green catalpa shade
Lord they say that Jesse Langtree's got it made
A little bit south of the Okechobee there's a story that the swamp folks tell
About a mean old man named Jesse Langtree
And a sweet young maid and a bottomless well
That water's cold but that don't matter how deep it is no one can tell
Just drop a stone you'll never hear it splatter
It just falls down down forever in the bottomless well
Through fifteen miles of snakes and gators
With the raging fever and the trembling chills
I wandered lost through the Okechobee
And there I seen 'em sittin' there by the bottomless well
Yeah now there he sits...
(Oh let's hear it for Jesse now hey Jesse)
I asked her for a drink of water and as Jesse slept me and her we talked a spell
She said that she was his wife and daughter Lord Lord
But his heart was cold cold and dark as the bottomless well
And as he slept I bent to kiss her I heard a loud and jealous yell
Felt my head explode in darkness two big hairy arms picked me up
And dragged me to the bottomless well
I woke up in fear and trembling I was staring down into the jaws of hell
As he held me high above his shoulders
A gonna throw me down down down to the bottomless well
Now here I sit in Jesse's big white wicker rocker
Eatin' his candy coated cashews sippin' his orange lemonade
While that sweet young thing fans the flies from off my eyebrows
I'm dozin' in the green catalpa shade
Enjoying things that Jesse Langtree made oh God bless you Jesse
Now some folks say that sweet thing pushed him but I was there and I'd swear he fell
But it ain't murder cause he ain't dead cause he's still a fallin'
Goin' down down forever in the bottomless well
Goin' down down down down down bye JesseTHAT OLD WOODEN ROCKER
There it stands by the fire with its back to the wall
That old wooden rocker, so stately and tall
With naught to disturb it but dusting of broom
And no one to use it in that parlor room
Chorus
As she sat by the fire, she would rock, rock, rock
And she heard but the tick of the old grand clock
Eighty years has she sat in that chair, prim and tall
That old wooden rocker that stands by the wall
How well I still remember in days that are gone by
How we stood by that rocker, my sister and I
And we listened to the stories that grandma would tell
As she sat in the rocker that we all loved so well
If the chair could but speak, oh the tales it would tell
How my poor aged grandpa, in his battle, fell
Beneath the stars and the stripes, he fought bravely and true
He cherished his freedom beneath the red white and blue
Chorus
Now grandma is dead, all the stories are done
All the children have followed her, yes one by one
They have all gone to meet her in the sweet by and by
And all that is left is my sister and I
ChorusThe sun is sinking in the west
The cattle go down to the stream
The red wing settle in their nest
Its time for a cowboy to sing
Purple light in the canyon
That's where I long to be
With my three good companions
Just my rifle, my pony and me
Whiporwill in the willow
Sings a sweet melody
Ridin' to Amarillo
Just my rifle, my pony and me
No more cows to be ropin'
Nor more strays will I see
Round the bend she'll be waitin'
For my rifle, my pony and me
For my rifle, my pony and meWell I saw it clear today that we were all more than only refugees
And the heads of state called out all of their reserves
So they could postpone World War III
I can hear the morning crier yellin' read all about it here's the truth
You are either just the newspaper boy or you're either Babe Ruth
Now how could we have been put upon this planet
Fools enough to think that we could be
The first to form a civilized involvement from the charismatic sea
There's a ten year old in the alley
Throws a hard ball off the wall that is the truth
He knows you're either just the newspaper boy or you're either Babe Ruth
The home run king
We can all dream up some explicit rationalized dream
Of exactly who we are
While the rockin' rolling home run king
Keeps the black Madonna sleepin' with a star
Now it doesn't matter how much bread you can spend
So you can hold the center booth
You are either just the newspaper boy or you're either Babe RuthWell you tell me today you were going far away
You tell me you wanna be free
But if your new friend breaks your heart in the end
Don't you come running back to me
Oh my darling go and stay if you want it that way
You don't love me and that is plain to see
If your new love turns you down, I won't be hangin' round
So don't you come running back to me
Just remember before you walk out the door
Once we were happy as can be
Then once you've gone away, there you'll have to stay
Don't you come running back to me
Oh my darling go and stay if you want it that way
You don't love me and that is plain to see
If your new love turns you down, I won't be hangin' round
So don't you come running back to me
Oh my darling go and stay if you want it that way
You don't love me and that is plain to see
If your new love turns you down, I won't be hangin' round
So don't you come running back to me
Don't you come running back to meWhat a friend we have in Jesus all our sins and grieves to bear
What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer
Oh what peace we often forfeit oh what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry everything to God in prayer
Have we trials and temptations is there trouble anywhere
If we have don't be discouraged take it to the Lord in prayer
Oh what peace we often forfeitWhat am I bid for these two eyes that gazed upon her
As a queen reighning on the throne
Once they were happy eyes now they're sad eyes goin' once goin' twice almost gone
What am I bid for these two lips that kissed her lips
The sweetest kiss these lips have ever known
It's been quite a while since they wore a smile goin' once goin' twice almost gone
What am I bid for these two arms that once held her
And knew the thrill of her charms for so long
Please make me some kind of an offer before all of the value is gone
What will you give for what you see before you this empty shell's standing alone
Here's the last chance before the bidding is over goin' once goin' twice goin' goneIn honduras cotton smoked and burned for days
To be outdone by guatamala
To be outdone by texas
With a pitchfork and a bell
Grubby little runners bring her news of me second hand
I won't tell her roaches eat my clay sculpture
I wanna tell her I am headless I am headless
She's walking on the great bloody dirt down there
Sleeping in the soft brown ring down there
Grubby little runners bring her news of me second handWell you ask me if I'll forget my baby I guess I will someday
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll get along I guess I will someway
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
Once I had a girl to lean on then she put me on my own
Heaven help me be a man and have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll miss her kisses I guess I will everyday
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll find another I don't know I can't say
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
Once I had a girl to lean on
I don't like it but I guess things happen that wayOoh, Las Vegas ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you gonna make a wreck out of me
Well, the first time I lose I drink whiskey
Second time I lose I drink gin
Third time I lose I drink anything
'Cause I think I'm gonna win
Ooh, Las Vegas ain't no place for a poor boy like me, no
Ooh, Las Vegas ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you gonna make a wreck out of me
Well, the Queen of Spades is a friend of mine
The Queen of Hearts is a bitch
Someday when I clean up my mind
I'll find out which is which
Ooh, Las Vegas ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you gonna make a wreck out of me
Well, I spend all night with the dealer
Trying to get ahead
Spend all day at the Holiday Inn
Trying to get out of bed
Ooh, Las Vegas ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you gonna make a wreck out of meBorn to lose I've lived my life in vain every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose it seems so hard to bear how I long to always have you near
You've grown tired and now you say we're through born to lose and now I'm losing you
[ steel ]
Born to lose my every hope is gone it's so hard to face an empty dawn
You were all the happiness I knew born to lose and now I'm losing you
There's no use to dream of happiness all I see is only loneliness
All my life I've always been so blue born to lose and now I'm losing youHangin' out at the old park pool
Right after Sunday school
Banana Boat, a rubber float
Another summer afternoon
Bon fire at the creek tonight
Bubba bringin' some homemade wine
Just enough to catch a buzz
And get us countrified
Oh, my my, that's just the way we do it
Cut off Levi's and kickin' country music
Miles from nowhere, there ain't no city limits
And that's where you're gonna find us havin' a small town big time
A population 903
Half of them are kin to me
And those that ain't they know my name
We're like one big family
Gather at that old camp site
To lie about the fish and their size
Uncle Carl and his old guitar
Singin' Louisiana Saturday Night!
Oh, my my, that's just the way we do it
Cut off Levi's and kickin' country music
Miles from nowhere, there ain't no city limits
And that's where you're gonna find us havin' a small town big time
Oh, my my, that's just the way we do it
Cut off Levi's and kickin' country music
Miles from nowhere, there ain't no city limits
And that's where you're gonna find us havin' a small town big time
A small town big time[ Both ]
We'll sing in the sunshine we'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine then be on our way
[ Bobby ]
I will never love you the cost of love's too dear
But though I'll never love you I'll live with you one year
[ Skeeter ]
I'll sing to you each morning mhm I'll kiss you every night
But darling don't cling to me I'll soon be out of sight
[ Both ]
But we can sing in the sunshine we'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine then be on our way
[ Skeeter ]
Daddy he once told me now don't you love you any man
Just take what they may give you and give out what you can
[ Bobby ]
Now when our year has ended and I have gone away
You'll often speak about me and this is what you'll say
[ Both ]
We sang in the sunshine we laughed every day
We sang in the sunshine then went on our way
Yes we sang in the sunshine then went on our way(Jean Ritchie)
I hear the soft wind sighing
In every bush and tree
The sound of my heart crying
When you are far from me
When we're apart, my darlin'
There's sorrow in the wind
When we're apart, my darlin
Sweet sorrow in the wind
You leave me in the morning
Your footsteps die away
Tho' not a leaf is stirring
I hear the wind all day
When we're apart, my darlin'
There's sorrow in the wind
When we're apart, my darlin'
Sweet sorrow in the wind
They say when love grows older
It dies and fades away
Yet all our life together
One ever brightening day
When we're apart, my darlin'
There's sorrow in the wind
When we're apart, my darlin'
Sweet sorrow in the wind
When we're apart, my darlin'
There's sorrow in the wind
When we're apart, my darlin'
Sweet sorrow in the wind
Sweet sorrow in the windYou Don't know who I [E] am

I'm the cold hard [E] truth.

You best remember me my [B7] friend
I am the cold hard [E] truth.I played some Stones and Skynyrd songs
Last night on the jukebox
And I'm gettin' back to hatin' me some soft rock
I don't almost reck' seein' if its you
Every time a midnight blue Pontiac
Pulls into the parkin' lot
Believe it or not
I'm almost alright
I'm just about fine
I barely wanna break his nose when I see you with another guy
I'm kind of okay
With you out of my life
I'm absotively, posolutely, almost alright
Alright
I took down most the magnets
And pictures of us in Cabo
I forgot my 'fridgerator
Was avocado (What?)
And I still might call every now and then
Way too late, just checkin' in
Tellin' you how good its been to let go
Aww, and baby to let you know
I'm almost alright
I'm just about fine
I barely wanna break his nose when I see you with another guy
I'll be kind of okay
In a couple more Bud Lights
Oh, I'm absotively, posolutely, almost alright
I might get a little sideways
Yeah, but what do you expect?
I might have a few bad days
I'm figuring out its for the best
I'm almost alright
I'm just about fine
I barely wanna break his nose when I see you with another guy
Would it be kind of okay
If I came by tonight?
Oh, I'm absotively, posolutely, almost alright
Yeah, I'm posolutely, absotutely almost alright
Alright
Almost alright
Hey, can I come over tonight, baby?
Ha-ha!When the quiet in this old house shows no mercy
And the lonesome just won't go away
That's when your restless spirit haunts me
And I swear, I hear you call my name
[Chorus]
I always loved the sound of your sweet voice
But now that sounds makes my poor heart break
You're long gone, baby, that's for certain
Cause I'm a hurtin', when I hear you call my name
I pray when I pass on over
That we will meet in the place where lost souls stay
Maybe then, when I look over my shoulder
You'll be there, when I hear you call my name
[Chorus](Dolly Parton)
Mama never seemed to miss the finer things of life
If she did she never did say so to daddy
She never wanted to be more than a mother and a wife
If she did she never did say so to daddy
The only thing that seemed to be important to her life
Was to make our house a home and make us happy
Mama never wanted any more than what she had
If she did she never did say so to daddy
He often left her all alone but she didn't mind the staying home
If she did she never did say so to daddy
And she never missed the flowers and the cards he never sent her
If she did she never did say so to daddy
Being took for granted was a thing that she accepted
And she didn't need those things to make her happy
And she didn't seem to notice that he didn't kiss and hold her
If she did she never did say so to daddy
One morning we awoke just to find a note
That mama carefully wrote and left to daddy
And as we began to read it
Our ears could not believe it
The words that she had written there to daddyIf heartaches brought fame
In loves' crazy game
I'd be a legend in my time
(Legend)
If they gave gold statuettes
For tears and regrets
I'd be a legend in my time
(Legend)
But they don't give awards
And there's no praise or fame
For a heart that's been broken
Over love that's in vain
If loneliness meant world acclaim
Then everyone would call my name
I'd be a legend in my time
(Legend)
If loneliness meant world acclaim
Then everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time
(Legend)
I'd be a legend in my timeIf I were to lose your love if you ever go
The stars still would shine above for ups I know
As blue as it's always been the sky still would be
For darling the world would end only for me
Only for me the sun no more would shine if I lost you how dark the night would be
Only for you I live this life of mine you are the one love meant only for me
The seasons would pass the same but I wouldn't know
The summer would bring the rain and winter the snow
In spring there'd be daffodils that others could see
For time would be standing still only for me
Only for meThere goes my everything
I hear footsteps slowly walkin'
As they gently walk across a lonely floor
And a voice is softly sayin'
"Darling, this will be goodbye forever more"
There goes my reason for livin'
There goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession
There goes my everything
As my mem'ry turns back the pages
I can see the happy years we had before
Now the love that kept this ol' heart beatin'
Has been shattered by the closin' of the door
There goes my reason for livin'
There goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession
There goes my everything
There goes my reason for livin'
There goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession
There goes my everything
There goes my only possession
There goes my everythingIf all the world were as pretty as you
There'd be a million smiles for every tear or two
And love would grow where once hurt only grew
If all the world were as pretty as you
All the raindrops fall just to be where you are
And just to see your smile is the wish for every fallen star
If all the world were as pretty as you
There'd be no need to dream our dreams the way we do
For here on earth would be heaven come true
If all the world were as pretty as you
If all the world were as pretty as youI'm a lifer
I can hear that rain fallin' on it's hidden roof
Girl after all we've been through
Feels like the calm after the storm
So what you say we take this sunday
Let me love you till it's monday
We'll go have a fun day and baby we'll get back to us
We'll get back to us
We've been trippin' over the same shit
I'm over the whose to blame shit
We throwin' up a white flag
I'm dancin' with who I came with
I'm your man and you my lady
Baby I'm a lifer I ain't goin' nowhere
Told you since day one I had to wife ya
Show the world that I just wanna love ya
Girl I don't wanna fight ya
Yeah you're the only one for me
God knows that I'm a product of George Strait
And dammit I love sayin' to you

Ain't nobody was sighted
My arms can't get any wider
Baby I'ma, baby I'ma, baby I'ma lifer
I'ma lifer, I'ma lifer, I'ma lifer
Whatever we go through girl we're family
There's nothin' we can't do can we
Tether through the weather, got us better than before
We just gotta learn how to stay here
Build on the love we made here
Make more time for prayer and the man upstairs
'Cause I believe we can move any mountain when we're good
I believe I ain't me without you walkin' out in that white dress
Life without you is lifeless
I'm your man and you my lady
Baby I'm a lifer I ain't goin' nowhere
Told you since day one I had to wife ya
Show the world that I just wanna love ya
Girl I don't wanna fight ya

And dammit I love sayin' to you
I done check yes and gave my mama's ring to you
Ain't nobody was sighted
My arms can't get any wider
Baby I'ma, baby I'ma, baby I'ma lifer
The twists and turns sometimes the love can hurt ya
Sometimes it burns The wait ain't always perfect
We'll just keep diggin', dig our feet into the dirt and get back to us
We'll get back to us
We've been trippin' over the same shit
I'm over the whose to blame shit
We throwin' up a white flag
I'm dancin' with who I came with
Can't wait to see our kids
Hope they look just like you

And dammit I love sayin' to you

Baby I'ma, baby I'ma, baby I'ma lifer
I'ma lifer, I'ma lifer, I'ma lifer
There's somethin' about the rain drops, the rain drops
Just let me fall
Till the rain stops, till the rain stops, let it fall
Just let 'em fall
There's somethin' about the rain drops, the rain dropsWell, since my baby left me
I found a new place to dwell
It's down at the end of lonely street
It's heartbreak hotel.
Oh well, baby
I've been so lonely, baby
I've been so lonely
I've been so lonely I could die.
Although it's always crowded,
You still can find some room.
For broken hearted lovers
To cry there in the gloom.
Oh well, I've been so lonely, baby
I've been so lonely
I've been so lonely I could die.
Well, the bell hops tears keep flowin'
The desk clerks dressed in black.
It's been so long on lonely street
They ain't ever gonna look back.
I've been so lonely baby,
I've been so lonely,
I've been so lonely I could die.
Well now, if your baby leaves you,
You got a tale to tell.
You take a walk down lonely street
To heartbreak hotel.
Well, I've been so lonely baby,
I've been so lonely,
I've been so lonely I could dieJust the way you float through a crowded room
With that long, tangled blonde hanging down
Just the way you move to the groove playing in my head
The soft of your lips, the touch of your hand
The being your man when it's time to go
Chorus:
Even if you'd never broke my heart
Even if you'd never broke my heart
I'd still be begging you to tear it apart
Even if you'd never broke my heart
If you were mine again by now
We'd be making out in the backseat of a city cab
We'd hit the floor just past the door 'cause we can't wait
Baby, we can't wait
It'd be the sun coming through
The window and you still being here
Repeat Chorus x3When he was young I held him on my knee
Pressed him close to me kissed his tears away
When he was young very young together we would ween
Lands of make believe where we two could play
But how the time hurries by summers go winters fly
Toys on the shelf he can reach by himself
Time hurries on youth is here then it's gone
Yes that's the plan now my boy's a little man
But in my heart forever he will be as he was to me when he was youngYou always get dolled up for your party
Good thing your birthday only comes once a year
Cause you always forget that you're so small
You can't take all that alcohol
And you wind up over my shoulder and into the car
But you'll always be beautiful
You'll always be beautiful
To me
I don't care if your hair's a mess from the night before
Your headaches and your fussin' and cussin' the sun
The makeup you had on your face
Is now all over your pillow case
And you're curled up under the covers into a ball
But you'll always be beautiful
You'll always be beautiful
To me
So baby don't you ever doubt
When father time starts drawing out
Those lines around your eyes
Cause you'll always be
You'll always be
Beautiful
You'll always be beautiful
To me
Always be
Always be beautiful
To me(Dell McCoury)
Though the miles are between us
I thought our love would strengthen
As it has so many times before
But something has happened
I can see it in your eyes
I can feel my world is crumblin'
And the blues are at my door
The last letter that you wrote was
On a blue piece of paper
That old feelin's back
The clouds are movin' in
The beginning of the end is near
I feel your love has faded into darkness
It seems I have no friend
I feel the blues movin' in
Oh it's not the words you wrote that made me sad
And broken-hearted
That's put me in this sad shape I'm in
Between the lines are mixed emotions
And there's teardrops on the paper
You said that's all I'll write today
I'll cose for now old friend
The last letter that you wrote was
On a blue piece of paper
That old feelin's back
The clouds are movin' in
My state of mind is desperate
And this hole that I'm sinkin' in
Gets deeper while I'm diggin' to get out
Oh please give the right answer to the questions I'm askin'
Tell me you still love me
That would turn my world about
The last letter that you wrote was
On a blue piece of paper
That old feelin's back
The clouds are movin' inRain falls on my roof
Doing what it's meant to do
Forever lost to the ground
Hangs around in the sky
Then lets go when it's time
It doesn't mind coming down
To make the flowers grow
And make the rivers flow
It doesn't need to know
Where it's gonna land
No more making plans
I don't care where I stand
I'd rather be like the rain
To make the flowers grow
And make the rivers flow
It doesn't need to know
Where it's gonna landIf he brings you happiness then I wish you both the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if he ever breaks your heart if the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
Though it hurts to let you go darling I want you to know
That I'll stand by you if ever you should call
And if I should ever hear that he made you shed a tear
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
To dry away every teardrop that you cried
If he ever leaves you blue just remember I love you
And I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
I'll be there before the next teardrop fallsHave yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas nowWell if I own the world and all its treasures from the mountain side to the rolling sea
Still darling my prize possession will be the love you gave to me
Well if I was a king of a mighty nation and anything I touch or see
Still darling my prize possession will be the love you gave to me
To lose your love would leave me cold my heart would go from young to old
I'd lose my fate and what I'd say I'd know such grief I'd run away
No other's kiss would have no meaning and other's love could never be
Cause darling my prize possession will be the love you gave to me
To lose your love
Cause darling my prize possession will be the love you gave to meHaven't you heard, Daddy's gone crazy
Haven't you heard, Mama is gone
Here I stand with my finger on his doorbell
My mind goes back to what I did last night
You see I finally talked his wife into leaving him
And I'm just trying to convince my conscience that it's alright
Well I can see my old friend sittin there just starin
And his little boy is cryin words that are welded in my mind
Haven't you heard, Daddy's gone crazy
Haven't you heard, Mama is gone
And either way I am the loser
And I've been crying all night long
Mister haven't you heardYou close the door in front of me, I wait patiently outside
And as the minutes tick away I feel my anger rise
And who's the object of my rage, and who's not being fair?
Is it you for your indifference or me for just standing there?
'Cause in my mind the room beyond is bathed in golden light
I dream about you through the day and I toss and turn at night
Sometimes it's hard to understand, when they say that pride's a sin
Should I go or should I stay on the outside looking in
Well I didn't make the grade today and I'm not the only one
But my heart, it won't stop hurting and feeling all alone
Maybe we'll trade places in some not so distant year
I'll hear your voice calling out, and I'll cover up my ears
'Cause in my mind the room beyond is bathed in golden light
I dream about you through the day and I toss and turn at night
Sometimes it's hard to understand, when they say that pride's a sin
Should I go or should I stay on the outside looking inWriter: Coke Sams
Saddle up my pickup truck
Say goodbye and wish me luck
Pass the word I'm riding out again
I gotta see that purple sage
I've got to roll with one more stage
Before this worn out western movie ends
Lord I used to ride so high
They wrote songs about me
But now the old man's home alone
They rode on without me
And now my six guns not so fast
I believe this trip might be my last
This Fadin' Renegade made his last stand
Hand me down my boots and spurs
Pray the weather don't get worse
Pass the word I've done the best I can
I gotta ride out one more last storm
I've got to rope one last longhorn
Before I turn my pony loose for good
Lord I used to think I'd ride
Gods prairie all of my, my days
But now you can't ride anywhere
For the barb wire and the highways
And I'm a stranger in this time
My buckskin days are all behind
This Fadin' Renegade's made his last stand
This Fadin' Renegade's done all he canWell I don't drink as much as I used to
Lately it just ain't my style
And the hard times don't hurt like they ought to
They pass quicker like when I was a child
[Chorus]
And somehow I've learned how to listen
For a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the morning is bringing
There's a song for the life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground
And the midsummer days sit so heavy
But don't they flow like the breeze through your mind
When nothing appears in a hurry
To make up for someone's lost time
[Chorus]I have appointed me the captain of my destiny
And proclaimed myself the pilot of my soul
But my mind remains uneasy cause the rest of me
Depends on someone I don't even know
May the man who has his finger on the button have a lovely day today
Hope nothing hangs him up or ticks him off or bums him out in any way
Lord help him keep his cool cause he could pull the final curtain on my play
May the man who has his finger on the button have a lovely day today
I can recall when only God could start the world anew
He who left his babies wasted on the shore
But now that man could have the last word if he wanted to
God ain't such a bad dude anymore
May the man who has his finger on the button have a lovely night tonight
Hope he's got himself a honey who knows what to do and I hope she does it right
And in my heart I know you won't go bananas and again he might
May the man who has his finger on the button have a lovely night tonight
May the man who has his finger(Angel, angel, whoa-oh-oh-oh, ooh)
(Angel, angel, whoa-oh-oh-oh, ooh)
You are my special angel

The Lord smiled down on me
And sent an angel to love (to love)

Try to keep the madness low
If they hear and it's wrong
And they come with torches on
Yeah come on
Be loud let your colors show
Try to keep the madness low
I tell them no with my hands
Make them understand the plan of it
Bright and gone
And I'm done forever
It's you and me forever

Be loud let the others know
First a whisper then it grows
I tell them go with my hands
Make them understand the last of it
Yeah come on, pain and all
Leave out pack your things and go
Leave the baby makers home
There's a time (now) and a place (now)
Someone built to take the race
When it calls you go
Head down don't you make a sound
Keep your plans all to yourself
They'll come true they follow you
They're what you're obligated to
Don't you listen to nobody else
And I'm done forever
It's you and me forever
'Cause I'm done forever
See it's you and me forever
And I'm done forever
It's you and me forever
'Cause I'm done forever
See it's you and me forever
And I'm doneThe old man used to dream of the fortunes he'd seek
Now he lives in a room where you pay by the week
His hands are all battered and his pony's gone lame
His bones always ache when the sky looks like rain
He dreams of the old days when bronc bustin' paid
The wide open spaces the buffalo glaized
Deep in his memory wild horses run on
But he knows the good times have all come and gone
There's nobody home on the range anymore
They closed down the bunk house and padlocked the door
Now there' s oil wells and motels and folks by the score
But there's nobody home on the range anymore
Now the eagle stopped flying, the night wind is still
And the last coyotes howling on some lonely hill
The old man is longing to lay it all down
In his final box the far side of town
Because he knows his last mountain is two flights of stairs
And his saddle turned into an old rocking chair
He wakes up in mornin' and wanders what for
'Cause there' s nobody home on the range anymore
There's nobody home on the range anymore
They closed down the bunk house and padlocked the door
Now there' s oil wells and motels and folks by the score
But there's nobody home on the range anymoreYou say your heart's been broken
And you just can't win
You say that you'll never love again
Let me tell you friend
You can't give up on love
That's the one thing we've got to keep going
Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
But you can't give up on love
Looked out my window and what did I see
It's another broken family
The kids are stayin' with mama at home
Daddy's livin' in a house all alone
You can't give up on love
That's the one thing we've got to keep going
Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
But you can't give up on love
Troubled times make it hard to stay
So many lovers take the easy way
But don't go crazy and jump ship too soon
Cause every day can't be a honeymoon
You can't give up on love
That's the one thing we've got to keep going
Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
But you can't give up on love
No, you can't give up on love
Oh, you can't give up on love(Collin Raye)
Well Duggan was a purebred hill country kicker
He loved to shoot his pistols
And he loved to drink his liquor
His daddy had long since given up on tryin'
To tame him
He knew he hated sweatin' in the fields
He couldn't blame him
But when his only son robbed the Chillicothe Flyer
He guessed the days were numbered
Till he'd have to face the fire
Well Duggan rode up to the house
His pa ran out to meet him
He said "Son, why'd you do it?"
Duggan said "I had my reasons"
His daddy told him, "Boy, you've always been
So full of juice, but any day your neck
It will be hangin' in a noose."
Duggan winked and mounted, stirred his
Horse into a lather
He never looked back... guess it really didn't matter
It wasn't too long till a team of Texas Rangers
Pounded on the door, man, faces
Filled with anger
Duggan's papa opened up, said "No need to shout,
I don't know where he is
But I know what he's all about."
He likes to dance out to the edge
He likes to cut to the chase
You see he's never been one for reinin' back
To a slow and steady pace
If you ask me where he's bound
Well, boys, I just can't respond
But from the look in his eyes
It's a safe bet he's headed
To the border and beyond.
Well the moral of this tale
Is you can't change a leopard's spots
Don't blame a man for failing to be
Something that he's not
So girl, with that in mind
Won't you step into the light
We'll move just left of center
Till we finally get it right
Remember I'm a push it to the limit
Kind of guy
You may ask me how we'll do it
But no need to ask me why
I like to dance out to the edge
I like to cut to the chase
You see, I've never been one for reinin' back
To a slow and steady pace
If you ask me where we're bound
Well, honey, I just can't respond
But from the look in your eyes
It's a safe bet we're headed
To the border and beyond.I close my eyes and picture the emerald of the sea
From the fishing boats at Dingle to the shores of Dunardee
I miss the river Shannon and the folks at Skibbereen
The moorlands and the midlands with their forty shades of green
But most of all I miss a girl in Tipperary town
And most of all I miss her lips as soft as eiderdown
Again I want to see and do the things we've done and seen
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar there's forty shades of green
[ strings ]
I wish that I could spend an hour at Dublin's churning surf
I'd love to watch the farmers drain the bogs and spade the turf
To see again the thatching of the straw the women glean
I'd walk from Cork to Larne to see the forty shades of green
But most of all I miss a girl...You've sure got a real nice place
So don't take this the wrong way
But I can tell by your decorating taste
You've been alone too long
You've got more candles than a midnight mass
That fancy mirror adds a touch of class
But do you know how good a mounted bass
Would look there on that wall
[Chorus]
You need a man around here
You can't do it all by yourself
To me it's painfully clear
That you could use a little help
Someone to kill the spiders
Change the channel and drink the beer
Seems to me that you sure need
A man around here
Thumbing through your stack of magazines
I don't see a Maxim or Field and Stream
I haven't been in a room this clean
Since they took my appendix out
Well you've gotta be kidding me
Don't tell me that thing is your TV
My laptop's got a bigger screen
Baby there ain't no doubt,
[Chorus]All the love we once shared together
The things that are now memories
Now when our old friends ask about me about you
I say she's a stranger to me
Oh I guess I'm a fool
For still loving you
And my feelings should change
Since you feel like you do
I walk down the street where we once walked together
You pass and you don't even speak
What have I done that's made you so bitter
To seem like a stranger to me
Oh I guess I'm a fool
For still loving you
And my feelings should change
Since you feel like you doIn between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart shaped locket
Staring at a family flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight
Mom and daddy just won't stop it
Fightin' at the drop of the faucet
Cuts through the walls catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire
Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through the tears
She's saying, she's praying.
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, just a bang bang
Rolling off your tongue (I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it, no pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Wish there was a white flag waving
Or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing
Like shoot'em up cowboys
Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the score card
And just turn off all the noise.
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, just a bang bang
Rolling off your tongue (I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it, no pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Oh I wish they didn't cut like a knife
I wish they didn't break you inside
I wish they didn't bang bang make you wanna run, yeah
Like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, just a bang bang
Rolling off your tongue (I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No shot from the trigger when you pull it, no pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Oh like little toy gunsCracks in the windshield
Nothin' underneath the hood
A dirt road through a cornfield
That never looked so good
As it does today
She just might run away
She stares out the window
From the back of the house
Wishin' when the wind blows
It would carry her down south
Like a Cadillac
Oh, she'd never look back
If a dream had a motor
An' wishes ran on gasoline
If desire just had tires
She'd be somewhere south of Abilene
She can almost feel the chrome an' steel
If money grew in cornfields
She'd be gone
On anything with wheels
She thinks about her mama's life
An' the boy down the road
She knows he would treat her right
But she can't see gettin' old
Broke down from the strain
An' prayin' for the rain
If a dream had a motor
An' wishes ran on gasoline
If desire just had tires
She'd be somewhere south of Abilene
She can almost feel the chrome an' steel
If money grew in cornfields
She'd be gone
On anything with wheels
A slow walk to the highway
Breeze blowin' through her hair
With her best friend's suitcase
An' her thumb in the air
She looks back toward town
An' a car slows down
On anything with wheels
She just might run awaywe're gona do this song for useless

chained her to the basement wall where she went insane
i was into whips'n'things she was into painBefore there ever came the time that I could realize
That you've meant all the world to me
You turned and I was gone to find the good life I've been missin'
But you were all the good there was in me
I went from bad to worse and back to find the good time
But it took the time like this to make me see
I searched high and low to just to find my reason
But you were all the good there ever was in me
[ steel ]
It's sad to think that much too late I've come to understand
That all the world was laying at my feet
I kicked aside the love that means much more than life just now
And you were all the good there was in me
I went from bad to worse...
Yes you were all the good there ever was in meEver since I met you you run me like a flag up and down the pole
You taught me into choppin' all the wood for your fire
Then kicked me out to sleep in the cold
I gave all the love that I knew how to give I stood faithfully by your side
I thought that you were takin' me straight up to heaven
But Lord it's been a roller coaster ride
And the preacher should've said did you wanna take a roller coaster ride
Cause that's all it's been since the day that you became my blushin' bride
Happiness becomes and then goes like the changin' of the tide
In and out up and down around and around lovin' you's a roller coaster ride
I no sooner think that I've got things the way they oughta be then wham there you go Puttin' down what you we puttin' up with yesterday shiftin' from high gear to low
I'm lookin' kinda gizzy cause you've got me kinda dizzy
And just about to lose my crazy mind
I knew love was often a merry-go-round but with you it's like a roller coaster ride
And the preacher should've said...
Lovin' you's a roller coaster rideTake this hammer, carry it to the captain
Take this hammer, carry it to the captain
Take this hammer, carry it to the captain
Tell him I'm a-gone, just tell him I'm a gone
If he asks you, was I running
If he asks you, was I running
If he asks you, was I running
Tell him I was flying, tell him I was flying
I don't want your old darn shackles
I don't want your old darn shackles
I don't want your old darn shackles
It hurts my leg, hurts my leg
I don't want no greenback dollar
I don't want no greenback dollar
I don't want no greenback dollar
It hurts my pride, hurts my prideI know promises can vanish in thin air
This life comes with no guarantees
Everything I have can all be gone
And leave me empty-handed fallin' on my knees
When I get knocked down, weak and confused
I gain strength with every thought of you
[Chorus]
You make me fearless
You make every day for me
Fearless, you make it easy to believe
You'll always be there for me whatever I go through
That's the difference between your love and this world
I'm fearless with you
I used to wake up afraid to face the day
Almost counting on something going wrong
I'd get scared thinking I was all alone
But now there's comfort in knowing I belong
In your arms, wrapped up in your love
The only place I feel safe enough
[Chorus]
With you by my side
I let go and close my eyes
And I feel like I can fly
[Chorus]Well, you are still here
And I am still here
Whether I ever loved you is
Not perfectly clear
You went a semester to West Texas State
But the freshmen fifteen you gained
Killed all your dates
I guess I still love you if I ever did
And I can see myself having a couple of kids
And we will get by
For the rest of our lives
So play the Cotton-Eyed Joe
For the folks don't you know
Keep the dogs in the truck
Til you leave
We got some wieners and buns
When the brisket's all gone
For our wedding in suburban Seguin
Well, I am still here
And you are still here
Whether I ever loved you is
Not perfectly clear
Though weight's not an issue you have gained more
And when I said I do well I slammed all the doors
To a future where I could see Paris in spring
And I wasn't prepared for the weight of this ring
But we will get by
For the rest of our lives
So play the Cotton-Eyed Joe
For the folks don't you know
Keep the dogs in the truck
Til you leave
We got some wieners and buns
When the brisket's all gone
For our wedding in suburban Seguin
So play some old BTO
For my friends don't you know
Keep your dogs in the truck
Til you leave
Get out the wieners and buns
Cause the briskets all gone
At our wedding in suburban Seguin
I said I love you in suburban Seguin
Now lets make loveAin't Had No Lovin'
Ain't done one single thing this morning
Except of crying all alone
Ain't had no lovin' since you've been gone
And I ain't gonna get no lovin' till you come home
Nothin's been the same since you've left me
Everything has gone from right to wrong
Ain't had no lovin' since you've been gone
And I ain't gonna get no lovin' till you come home
Smiles of yesterday now find me cryin'
The red and golden rainbow turned to blue
With every breath I take I feel like dyin'
A life just ain't worth livin' when I ain't got you
Each and every day I've been without youA lesson too late for the learning made of sand made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turning in your hand in your hand
Are you going away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Well I could've loved you better didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
As I walk alone my thoughts're tumbling round and round round and round
Underneath our feet a subway's rumbling underground underground
Are you going away
You got reasons of plenty for going this I know this I know
The weeds have been steadily growing please don't go please don't go
Are you going away
You know that was the last thing on my mindWere you there when they crucified my Lord
Were you there when they crucified my Lord
Oh sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble tremble
Were you there when they crucified my Lord
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree
Oh sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble tremble
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree
Were you there when they pierced him in his side
Were you there when they pierced him in his side
Oh sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble tremble
Were you there when they pierced him in his side
Were you there when the sun refused to shine
Were you there when the sun refused to shine
Oh sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble tremble
Were you there when the sun refused to shine
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb
Oh sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble tremble
Were you there when they laid him in the tombHow many arms have held you
And hated to let you go
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know
And how many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know
So always make me wonder
And always make me guess
Even if I ask you
Darlin', don't confess
No you just let that remain your secret
'Cause darlin' I do love you so
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to knowJohnny is a joker (he's a bird)

where the willows hang down
F Am C Dm
And the wild birds all warble
Dm F
with a low moaning sound
F Am C Dm
Down in the hollow,
Dm F
Where the waters run cold,
Bb
It was there I first listened
F
To the lies that you told
Now I lay on my bed
And I see your sweet face.
The past I remeber,
Time cannot erase.
The letter you wrote me,
It was written in shame.
And I know that your conscience
Still echoes my name.
The nights are so long,
And sorrow runs deep.
And nothing is worse
Than a night with out sleep.
I'll walk out alone
And look at the sky.
Too empty to sing,
Too lonesome to cry.
If the ladies were blackbirds
And the ladies were thrushes,
I'd lie there for hours
In the chilly, cold marshes.
If the ladies were squirrels
With a high bushy tail
I'd fill up my shotgun
With rock salt and nails.Alright, alright, it's just a girl, just go say, "Hey"
Don't try any stupid lines
Seen you walk in about a quarter to ten

Yeah
I was actually about to leave myselfAt birth Mom and Papa called their little boy Ned
They raised him on the banks of the river bed
A houseboat tied to a big tall tree
A home for my Papa and my Mama and me
The clock strikes three, Papa jumps to his feet
Already mama's cookin' Papa something to eat
At half past, Papa, he's ready to go
He jumps in his piro headed down the bayou
He's got fishin' lines strung across the Louisiana river
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
He set the traps in the swamp catchin' anything he can
Gotta make a livin' he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a livin' he's a Louisiana man
A muskrat hides a hangin' by the dozen
Even got a lady make a muskrat's cousin
Got 'em out dryin' in the hot hot sun
Tomorrow Papa's gonna turn 'em into mon
They call my Mama Rita and my Daddy's Jack
A little baby brother on the floor, that's Mac
Big brother Ed's on the bayou fishin'
Fram and Malene are the family twins
On the river float Papa's great big boat
That's for my Papa goes into town
He takes every bit of the night and day
To even reach the place where the people stay
I can hardly wait until tomorrow comes around
That's the day my Papa takes his fire to town
Papa promised me that I could go even let me see a cowboy show
I saw the cowboys and Indians for the first time
Then I told my Papa gotta go again
Papa said hon' we got the lines to run
We'll come back tomorrow 'cause the work to be done
He's got fishin' lines strung across the Louisiana river
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
He set the traps in the swamp catchin' anything he can
Gotta make a livin' he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a livin' he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a livin' he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a livin' he's a Louisiana man
HeyI've had big dreams come true
And I believe in angels
Although I can't see them
They're watching over everything I do
Ain't no easy street around the bend on my road
No pot of gold at the end of my rainbow
But I don't mind 'cause baby I got you
The rain keeps the flowers from dying
He sun lights the world when it shines
The midnight sky has a blanket of stars and the moon
And baby I got you
I can't imagine one day without you in it
Life alone just wouldn't be worth living
Love would be a wish that never came true
Lord knows I've got more than I deserve
But I don't question the prayer that I've had answered
I did something right
'Cause baby I got you
The rain keeps the flowers from dying
He sun lights the world when it shines
The midnight sky has a blanket of stars and the moon
And baby I got youWoke up this morning
Happy as could be
Looked out my window
And what did I see?
A comin' up my sidewalk
Just as plain as day
A well a here come trouble that I never thought I'd see
When you went away
Hello trouble, come on in
You talk about heartaches
Where'n the world ya been?
I ain't had the miseries
Since you been gone
Hello trouble, trouble, trouble
Welcome home
We'll make a pot of coffee
And you can rest your shoes
A you can tell me them sweet lies
And I'll listen to you
For I'm just a little part of
Of the life you've lived
But I'd rather have a little bit of trouble
Than to never know the love you give
Hello trouble, come on in
You talk about heartaches
Where'n the world ya been?
I ain't had the miseries
Since you been gone
Hello trouble, trouble, trouble
Welcome homeFull moon Friday night after the game
Stars must have all lined up early that day
I just turned 17, she had me by a month
We were young, we were green to the taste, to the touch
From that very first kiss, it was like we were born for that moment
Caught up in the perfect storm
It came in like a flood over the gate
Swallowed us up and it swept us away
We were over our heads, me and that girl
We were out of our minds, it was out of this world
It was always too much, it was never enough
It was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up
It was love
We reigned like the king and the queen of the land
Everyone wanted some of what we had then
Yeah, we were the ones they all talked about
Like we were the fire that would never go out
It came in like a flood over the gate
Swallowed us up and it swept us away
We were over our heads, me and that girl
We were out of our minds, it was out of this world
It was always too much, it was never enough
It was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up
It was love
We knew it was coming, still, it came way too soon
Neither one knew what to say or to do
So, we just let the radio play while we danced
We laughed and we cried like I never have since
It came in like a flood over the gate
Swallowed us up and it swept us away
We were over our heads, me and that girl
We were out of our minds, it was out of this world
It was always too much, it was never enough
It was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up
It was love
It was love
It was love
It was just the kind of stuff you just can't make upDon't give my heart a break
Don't give it an ache for heavens sake
I'm on my knees now pretty please
Don't give my heart a break
Don't give my heart a break
Don't put the pressure on me precious
Take about as much as it can take
Don't give my heart a break oh - oh
Well I thought this heart has beaten love for sure
It's never missed this many beats before
This heart can't get arrested any more
Cause I feel it starting to crack
It's under attack
Don't give my heart a break
Don't give it a shake - for heaven's sake
I'm on my knees now pretty please
Don't give my heart a break
Don't give my heart a break
How I wish that it would let up, I'd be set up
If I had a pound for every pound
I'd buy my heart a break
Can I buy my heart a break wo, wo
Don't give my heart a break
Isn't it a shame, isn't it a crime
Can I buy my heart a little more time
Some time cause
I thought this heart had beaten love for sure
But it never missed this many beats before
This heart can't get arrested any more
'Cause I feel it starting to crack
It's under attackI can almost feel you smiling
From beyond those silver skies
As you watch me finding my way
Here without you in my life
Chorus:
No one knows but you
How I feel inside
No one knows
No one knows but you
I've come so close to believing
All the echoes in the wind
Brushing my hair off my shoulders
I feel you there once again
Chorus
And if there is some magic
Some way around these stars
Some road that I can travel
To get to where you are
I'll cry this empty canyon
An ocean full of tears
And I won't stop believing
That your love is always nearHey, everybody, let's have some fun
You only live but once
And when you're dead you're done, so
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll
Don't sit there mumblin', talkin' trash
If you want to have a ball
You gotta go out and spend some cash, and
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll
Hey Mr. landlord, lock up all the doors
When the police comes around
Just tell 'em that the joint is closed
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll
Hey tell everybody
Mr. king's in town
I got a dollar and a quarter
Just rarin' to clown
But don't let nobody play me cheap
I got fifty cents more that I'm gonna keep, so
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll
No matter whether rainy weather
Birds of a feather gotta stick together
So get yourself under control
Go out and get together and let the good times roll( Ancestors EP )
When we go to glory
When our time is over
Will we stand unspoken for
When the light becomes too blinding
When my ancestors come to meet me
They'll have questions about my drugging
They may look on my enemies kindly
When my life becomes a memory
Will my ancestors meet me up there
They may look upon me
They may take it badly
All the men I used to love
All the things they won't approve ofToo sweet to be forgotten what could have been could be
Too right to be too wrong for me and too real to be only a sweet memory
The moon is just another candle to read my feelings by
Reflecting on leftover yesterdays my how time does fly
You're welcome in all of my daydreams so nice to have on my mind
Why should I try to forget you you're almost all that I left behind
Too sweet to be forgotten...
So until you find another playground you're welcome to play on my mind
Why should I try to forget you you're almost all that I left behind
Too sweet to be forgotten...Won't say I love you babe
Won't say I need you babe
But I'm going to get you babe
And I will not do you wrong
Living's mostly wasting time
And I waste my share of mine
But it never feels too good
So let's not take too long
You're as soft as glass and I'm a gentle man
We got the sky to talk about
And the world to lie upon
Days up and down they come
Like rain on a conga drum
Forget most, remember some
But don't turn none away
Everything is not enough
Nothing is too much to bear
Where you been is good and gone
All you keep's the getting there
To live is to fly low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes
It's goodbye to all my friends
It's time to go again
Think of all the poetry
And the pickin' down the line
I'll miss the system here
The bottom's low and the treble's clear
But it don't pay to think too much
On the things you leave behind
I may be gone but I won't be long
I'll be bringing back the melody
And the rhythm that I find
We all got holes to fill
And them holes are all that's real
Some fall on you like a storm
Sometimes you dig your own
But choice is yours to make
Time is yours to take
Some dive into the sea
Some toil upon the stone
To live is to fly low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
The sleep out of your eyesThere's a place down the street we call Sam's Place.
It starts a-jumpin' every evening when the sun goes down.
You can always find me down at Sam's Place,
For that's where the gang all hangs around.
There's ol' Shimmy Shakin' Tina
She hails from Pasadena.
She always got a big smile on her face.
There's Hootch-why-kootchy Hattie, she comes from Cincinnati,
Yeah, there's always a party at Sam's Place.
Well, they've got a swingin' band down at Sam's Place.
You can hear 'em pickin' twenty blocks away.
They're playin' country music down at Sam's Place,
From the setting sun until the break of day.
There's ol' Shimmy Shakin' Tina
She hails from Pasadena.
She always got a big smile on her face.
There's Hootch-why-kootchy Hattie, she comes from Cincinnati,
Yeah, there's always a party at Sam's Place.you had such a lovely crooked smile
and blue eyes that were gray when it was raining
and i still have the bracelet with the gold
and ivory clovers that you made me
it was the only way
it was the only way
it was the only way
someone said you left there just in time
when i was on the other side waiting
and i can see you standing with your suitcase
in the lamplight there without me
it was the only way
it was the only way
it was the only way
funny how the details never fade
the names of where we were
and what we did there
but all i have are spaces emptied
interrupting memories without you
it was the only way
it was the only way
it was the only way
it was the only way
it was the only wayYou have painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplatin' going out somewhere
The shadows on the wall tell me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby don't take your love to town
It's hard to love a man whose legs're bent and paralized
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age Ruby I realize
But it won't be long I've heard them say until I'm not around
Oh Ruby don't take your love to town
For it wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chores
I know Ruby I'm not the man I used to be but Ruby I still need your company
She's leaving now cause I just heard the slamming of the door
Way I know I heard it slam one hundred times before
If I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby don't take your love to townBoiled peanuts anytime, painted on a plywood sign
Pull to the shoulder and buy a sack
An old man with a dirty face swears they're the best you'll taste
Grows 'em fresh in that red dirt field out back, yeah, that's a fact
Grace is a mechanic's wife and their toe-head boys are her whole life
Sews patches on blue jeans night and day
Never does much for herself, doesn't dream of fame or wealth
Just a ballpark bleacher and a place to pray
Some are called to preach the gospel, string fence in Colorado
Some are born to raise a family
Swing a hammer at a nail, haul bricks or carry mail
Go to college, Duke or Yale, but me
I got songs for sale
There's not a lot of tread on my tires, In some spots you can see the wires
Just hope they make it to the next town so I can sing
I'm still learning lots of lessons, I'm still calling it a profession
Travelin' 'round strummin' these guitar strings
Some are good at mending bones, fixing drinks and telephones
Some are born to wear pin stripes on their sleeves
Swing a hammer at a nail, haul bricks or carry mail
Go to college, Duke or Yale, but me
I got songs for sale
I see it in a lot of places
I read it in a lot of faces
Some are called to preach the gospel, string fence in Colorado
Some are born to raise a family
Swing a hammer at a nail, haul bricks or carry mail
Go to college, Duke or Yale, and me
Yeah me, I got songs for sale
Yeah, I got songs for saleGirl, Ive got scars and Ive seen stars
From men nearly twice my size
Yeah, lifes sticks and stones have broke a few bones
But Ive always survived
So when I take a look at all Ive took
It dont seem right to me
How a little bitty woman with just a few words
Come bring me to my knees
Sticks and stones, wouldnt hurt a bit
Compared to the cold, cruel words that just left your lips
Id rather you pick up a rock, a stick full of thorns
Rear back and let em fly
Cause those sticks wouldnt cut, stones hurt as much
As the sound of your goodbye
Yeah, I know Im the reason for youre leavin
Im to blame sure enough
Its like you say there aint a woman made
That can live without true love
So if its too late to set things straight
And theres no forgivin me
Then dont say nothin, just pick you up somethin
Thatll end this misery
Sticks and stones wouldnt hurt a bit
Compared to the cold, cruel words that just left your lips
Id rather you pick up a rock, a stick full of thorns
Rear back and let em fly
Cause those sticks wouldnt cut, stones hurt as much
As the sound of your goodbyeYou look at me that way I know what your eyes say
Your eyes reflect love and desire
I see that you need me I need you to please me
You touch me and set me on fire
The way that you love me the way that you touch me
The way that you whisper my name
I cannot resist you each time I kiss you
Then everything goes up in flames
Baby I'm burnin' out of control baby I'm burnin' body and soul
Hot as a pistol that flamin' desire baby I'm burnin' you've got me on fire
I'm on fire
This red hot emotion puts fireworks in motion
It looks like the 4th of July
There's no use in fighting this fire you've ignited
Just stand back and watch the sparks fly
Baby I'm burnin' out of control...
Baby I'm burnin' baby I'm burnin' baby I'm burnin' baby I'm burnin'
Baby I'm burnin' out of control...
Baby I'm burnin' out of control...The pain of goodbye and the teardrops in her eyes
Ain't nothing to the first long night in this empty house alone
The sweetest times of a romance
Will fill your mind the last slow dance
Hold on tight, will you make her be the one to say
It's all gone and you know that it's all gone
The lights go down, the charge is done
The battle is over and the other side won
It don't help to know that it ain't a matter of trying
I'll hold you close one last time
The cost of love might be my mind
It hurts like hell when you're living in a love that's dying
And you know that's it all over but the crying
I remember everything we've done
And the nights when we were one
The silence comes
I can't imagine my life without you
But you've got plans and I've got mine
It's gonna take a long, long time
I hope someday I can smile
And think, how crazy I was about you
So crazy about you
The lights go down, the charge is done
The battle is over and the other side won
It don't help to know that it ain't a matter of trying
I'll hold you close one last time
The cost of love might be my mind
It hurts like hell when you're living in a love that's dying
And you know that's it all over but the crying
I don't know the reason
And there's nothing to blame but time
And I've looked into your eyes and they don't lie
The lights go down, the charge is done
The battle is over and the other side won
It don't help to know that it ain't a matter of trying
I'll hold you close one last time
The cost of love might be my mind
It hurts like hell when you're living in a love that's dying
And you know that's it all over but the crying
It all over but the crying, it all over but the crying
It all over but the cryingBusted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord,
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGeeIt's the third hardest thing I'll ever do
Leaving here without you
And the second hardest thing I'll ever do
Is telling her about you
She's been good to me
When things were going rough
How can I tell her now
That good ain't good enough
The hardest thing I'll ever have to do
Is holding her and loving you
If she'd give me one good reason I'd be gone
But she ain't done one thing wrong
So don't expect me just to walk out of the door
I still love her but I love you more
She's been good to me
When things weren't going right
She made my days
Long before you made my nights
The hardest thing I'll ever have to do
Is holding her and loving you
Yeah the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
Is holding her, loving you
Girl the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
Is holding her, loving youI believe for every drop of rain
That falls a flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows
I believe for every one who goes astray
Someone will come and show the way
I believe, I believe
I believe above the storm
The smallest prayer will still be heard
I believe that someone in
That great somewhere hears every word
Every time I hear a new born baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why I believeOnce more to be with you, dear
Just for tonight to hold you tight
Once more I'd give a fortune
If I could see you once more
Forget the past, this hurt can't last
So I don't want it to keep us apart
Your love I need say, you'll love me and say
You'll give me all of your heart
Once more to be with you
Once more to be with youI burned all the letters that you never wrote
I broke all the promises you never spoke
I swallowed my pride
Till I thought I would choke
Given 'bout all I can take
I've given 'bout all I can take
You want somebody
Guess, we all do
You've got a heart
That won't let it come true
And I never was one to fake
Given 'bout all I can take
I've given 'bout all I can take
I cried over milk that never was spilled
And I've danced to waltzes
And you just stood still
Time is much too precious to kill
Given 'bout all I can take
I've given 'bout all I can take
You want somebody
Guess, we all do
You've got a heart
That won't let it come true
And I never was one to fake
Given 'bout all I can take
I've given 'bout all I can take
Oh, I've given 'bout all I can takeGod saved some lucky men to be cowboys
'Cause no ordinary man can wear the name
Hearts of gold and hands of leather
And that restless spirit no one will ever tame
CHORUS:
Branded by the land
Befriended by the wind
You may never pass this way again
But somethin' in the wind is sayin' that your time is now, boy
Your daddy calls you a drifter
I call you cowboy
That voice of freedom is callin' you down the line
And you don't know where you're goin' but you know what you leave behind
So you're saddlin' up now to chase your dreams
To show yourself and the world what freedom really means
CHORUSThere is nothing that is wrong
Wanting you to stay here with me
I know you got somewhere to go
Won't you make yourself at home and never leave
And don't you ever leave
Lay Down Sally resting in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to
Lay Down Sally no need to leave so soon
I been tryin' all night long just to talk to you
Sun ain't nearly on the rise
We still got the moon and stars above
Underneath the velvet skies
Love is all that matters won't you stay with me
And don't you ever leave
Lay Down Sally resting in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to
Lay Down Sally no need to leave so soon
I been tryin' all night long just to talk to you
I long to see the mornin' light
Color in your face so dreamily
So don't you go and say goodbye
You can lay your worries down and stay with me
And don't you ever leave
Lay Down Sally resting in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to
Lay Down Sally no need to leave so soon
I been tryin' all night long just to talk to youYou came into my life like an answer to a prayer
Like a star that falls from the sky right out of thin air
Some might say it's a miracle or a dream come true
But from that day I always knew
[Chorus]
Heaven is missing an angel
That's the only thing that it can be
Heaven is missing an angel
Cause you're right here with me
No one else in the world has touched me like you do
It's super natural, girl, the way I feel when I'm with you
I'm in paradise whenever you're around
Then when I look in your eyes there's no doubt
Heaven is missing an angel
That's the only thing that it can be
Heaven is missing an angel
Cause you're right here with me
I'm in paradise whenever you're around
Then when I look in your eyes there's no doubt
Heaven is missing an angel
That's the only thing that it can be
Heaven is missing an angel
Cause you're right here with me
Right here with me
You're right hereOne day train was passin', I caught it comin' by
Look this old world over under God's blue sky
My darlin' stood there weepin' as I was looking back
Kissed my baby cryin' in the smoke along the track
Goodbye so long until I come back home, you'll be my dream
Goodbye so long, there's lots of places that I've never seen
I'll always be a drifter but I'll come driftin' back
Where I left you cryin' in the smoke along the track
I like to keep on goin' it helps me when I'm blue
Get the urge to travel that's all I want to do
I just can't seem to settle down because I like to roam
When I hear that whistle blow I've gotta move along
Goodbye so long there's something down the track keeps callin' me
Goodbye so long I guess that's just the way I'll always be
So when I get that feelin' don't try to hold me back
I'd only leave you cryin' in the smoke along the track
I know my baby loves me, I love my baby too
He don't understand me when I'm feelin' blue
When I hear that whistle blow, I hurry home and pack
Leave my baby cryin' in the smoke along the track
Goodbye, so long, I hate to leave you, but I've got to go
Goodbye, so long, it's comin' down just hear that whistle blow
It'll be here in a minute, you'll wave and I'll look back
I'm gonna leave you cryin' in the smoke along the track
Goodbye so long until I come back home, you'll be my dream
Goodbye so long, there's lots of places that I've never seen
I'll always be a drifter and I'll come driftin' back
Where I left you cryin' in the smoke along the track
Oh I'm gonna leave you cryin' in the smoke along the track
{Terrific
Nash Randers
Thank you
God bless you all
You're terrific}You are mine
The edge I need when I am out of line
The air I breathe when I believe I'm dying
I guess you are there
It is told
With age our hearts are destined to grow cold
Well I won't argue that but this I know
The snow won't fall on me
Life goes, yes I guess it's true
Why close down we'll follow soon
Where we are is not so far from where we're gonna be
You and me
Our life is a heel
With danger in our hearts the roads our field
With shadows deep and dark girl grip your wheel
And push your moment through
Life goes, yes I guess it's true
Why close down we'll follow soon
Where we are is not so far from where we're gonna be
You and me
You and me
You are mine
The first to kiss the last to say goodbye
The answer to the question who do I owe my everything?
Life goes, yes I guess it's true
Why close down we'll follow soon
Where we are is not so far from where we're gonna be
You and me
You and meWell, I can see you're dancing every dance with her
And it seems to me you're dancing much too close to her
When you're sitting at our table you're sitting next to her
But my heart knows that it's true that she loves me, she don't love you
Well let me tell you friend I'm wise to your lies
Even telling me that I'm the guy for her
And every little thing that you do and say
Has given me the way you're in love with her
Well just one more dance with her
And friend you're gonna see
What it's like to hit the floor
And do a little dance with me
So here's your coat and here's your hat
I think you'd better leave
'Cause she just told me it's true
She loves me, she don't love you
Well let me tell you friend I'm wise to your lies
Even telling me that I'm the guy for her
And every little thing that you do and say
Has given me the way you're in love with her
Well just one more dance with her
And friend you're gonna see
What it's like to hit the floor
And do a little dance with me
So here's your coat and here's your hat
I think you'd better leave
'Cause she just told me it's true
She loves me, she don't love you
So here's your coat and here's your hat
I think you'd better leave
'Cause she just told me it's true
She loves me, she don't love youI'm watching the clock tick the hours away
They say that I will hang at the dawn of the day
But why should I fear death when it's life anew
For dying only takes me much closer to you
You left me in anger and walk by the sea
And when they found your body they blamed it on me
But you know they were wrong dear so wait for awhile
Soon we'll be together beyond the last mile
Stars hide their face to make way for the sun
Death it'll soon claim me and make us as one
While others are walking the streets with a smile
Then I will be walking beyond the last mile
[ steel ]
The jury agreed I have taken your life
The sentence that they gave me it cut like a knife
But I'll face my Maker today with a smile
I know that you'll be waiting beyond the last mile
The chaplain is making his last plea to God
Soon the numbered steps to the scaffold I'll trod
My footsteps won't falter I'll walk with a smile
I know that you'll be waiting beyond the last mileA rose must remain with the sun and the rain
Or its lovely promise won't come true
To each his own, to each his own
And my own is you
What good is a song if the words don't belong
And a dream must be a dream for two
No good alone to each his own
For me there's you
If a flame is to grow there must be a glow
To open each door there's a key
I need you I know, I can't let you go
Your touch means too much to me
Two lips must insist on two more to be kissed
Or they'll never know what love can do
To each his own, I've found my own
One and only youI came to hear the music, I came to hear the sound
The music, God knows it brings me down
A long, long road from now to then
I know your song, sing it again
'Cause there's so many things I don't believe I understand
How the days turn into weeks, turn into months
The year's become a moment in the ever changing sand
Did God make time to keep it all from happening at once? All at once
I came to love the music before I came to be
To know the music before it came to me
A long, long time ago, I don't know when
We sang a song along with the wind
And there's so many things I don't believe I'll understand
Why the days turn into weeks, turn into months?
And the year's become a moment in the ever changing sand
Yes, God made time to keep it all from happening at once, all at onceToo old too old he's too old to cut the mustard anymore
Well when I was young I had a lotta pep I could get around I didn't need no help
But since I'm old and a gettin' gray the people all look at me and say
Too old too old he's too old to cut the mustard anymore
Buddy's gettin' too old Buck's done got too old
He's too old to cut the mustard anymore
I used to could jump just like a deer now I need a new landing gear
I used to could jump a picket fence but now I'm lucky if I jump an inch
Too old too old...
[ piano ]
Well when I was young I had an automobile scoot myself right under the wheel
I had to fight the gals off with a stick but now they say he makes me sick
Too old too old...
Buck's too old to cut the mustard anymoreWell since the day the world began
I know God has had a master plan
He made a sky to hold the sun
He made sands to hold the sea
He made hearts for never ending love
And he made you for me
[Chorus]
No hurricane, no driving rain
Has our kind of power
No valley wide, no mountain slide
Can hold a love like ours
No ocean deep, no fire's heat
Can break a bond so true
Nothing, Nothing, Nothing in this world's
As strong as me and you
Through all the days and darkest nights
Our love will be the guiding light
With every breath I take
And every day I'm awake
This love of ours will never fade
Until the end of time
[Chorus]
Oh, no love I know of,
Can hold me like you do
[Chorus]
Strong as me and you
As strong as me and youHere I am stuck in my mind, Just trying to get by
All you'll understand, And will you get me
Everyday that comes my way, I think about what you will say
Finding strength one day, I will tell you I am gay
Take me or leave me now, I've done my best to make you proud
My love for you will never change, I hope you feel the same
Take me or leave me now, I will still make you proud
I'm still your baby girl, Take me or leave me (x2)
After its off my chest, I hope that you will try your best
Tell me that your fine, Just give me that sign
Everyday its eating me, Always consuming me
One thing on my mind, Is this the right time
Take me or leave me now, I've done my best to make you proud
My love for you will never change, I hope you feel the same
Take me or leave me now, I will still make you proud
I'm still your baby girl, Take me or leave me (x2)
La La La La, La La La La (x5)
Take me or leave me now, I've done my best to make you proud
My love for you will never change, I hope you feel the same
Take me or leave me now, I will still make you proud
I'm still your baby girl, Take me or leave me (x2)
La La La LaWhy must you always try
To make me over, take me as I am or let me go
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover
Take me as I am or let me go
You're trying to reshape me in a mold love
In the image of someone you used to know
But I won't be a standing for an old love
Take me as I am or let me go
You're trying to reshape meOh lend me a hand please Lord and guide me
And help lead me down the road that is right
Oh carry me through these hours of darkness
And show me the path the shining light
I'm a wandering soul I'm lost from my savior
A sheep that has strayed so far from the fold
Just tarrying along in the clutch of old Satan
But I'm hoping someday you'll save my soul
Dear Lord please forgive the grief I have caused you
The thoughts of my sins that tortured my soul
Oh help me to know the joy of salvation
Help cleanse my life through and make me whole
I'm a wandering soulI Wish I'd Have A Circle Driveway

Album: Portrait
I wish I had a circle driveway
There's too much for me to leave behind
If I only had a circle driveway
I'd just ride around and wave goodbye
I really can't believe she packed my suitcase
I can't believe that both her eyes were dry
The only thing we didn't have together
Is a right now badly needed circle drive
I Wish I had a circle driveway
There's too much for me to leave behind
If I only had a circle driveway
I'd just ride around and wave goodbye
Well I'll slam it in reverse and watch for traffic
'Cause I don't want the kids to see me cry
It's time to head a new direction
So I'll do my best to get it into drive
I Wish I had a circle driveway
There's too much for me to leave behind
If I only had a circle driveway
I'd just ride around and wave goodbyeThe orchid is a flower that blooms so tenderly
To thrill the fairest lady of the land
If placed beside a blushing rose the rose cannot compare
But how was such as I to understand
I overlooked an orchid while searching for a rose
The orchid that I overlooked was you
The rose that I was searching for has proved to be untrue
The orchid now I find my dear was you
[ steel ]
The rose has lost its color but the orchid is the same
And I'm alone to face these lonely years
I didn't see the orchid I was looking for a rose
And now I pay the price with bitter tears
Cause I overlooked an orchid...I thought some time in the sun
Would help me get over you
But I could tell from day one
This is a place meant for two
Now here I sit on the beach
Watching the tide ebb and flow
I booked my room for a week
But now I'm ready to go
I'm in a tropical depression
I've got the blue water blues
Can't shake this loving you obsession
Can't stand this sand in my shoes
This forgetting you vacation
Is just a fool's holiday
If I can't get over you
This tropical depression is gonna
Blow me away
This should be paradise
Heaven down by the sea
Without you here by my side
It feels like hell to me
I'm in a tropical depression
I've got the blue water blues
Can't shake this loving you obsession
Can't stand this sand in my shoes
This forgetting you vacation
Is just a fool's holiday
If I can't get over you
This tropical depression is gonna
Blow me away
If I can't get over you
This tropical depression is gonna
Blow me awayI can't count the times we've sat and cried
Up all night, trying to work it out
But this feels different than it ever was
This is serious
Are we over now
Everything I've ever learned about love
Baby, I've learned it from us
Love can make you really believe
Love can knock you straight to your knees
Love can make you fight for the things you wanna hold
But sometimes, baby, love lets go
You're the only one who ever thought
That I was strong and I liked it
And I'm the only one you'd ever tell
When you needed help, like I did
I know it hurts you to do this to me
But baby, don't stay where you don't want to be
Love can make you really believe
Love can knock you straight to your knees
Love can make you fight for the things you wanna hold
But sometimes, baby, love lets go
Sometimes, baby, love lets goMy plans and hopes have tumbled down
My castle of dreams plunged to the ground
How can you face me after what you've done
You've shattered my dreams one by one
One by one you broke each vow you made
It was you who lied it was me who paid
As sure as there's a heaven beyond the sun
We'll pay for our lies one by one
How can you go to sleep at night
Don't know memories make you long for daylight
You'll pay the price after having your fun
You'll regret each mistake one by one
One by one you broke each vow you madeI've been out on this highway of heartache
Hopin' that somewhere down the line
I could find someday who
Could rev me like you do
So grab onto my wheel
And I'll be fine
Take the keys to my heart
And drive me crazy
I've been runnin' on empty way too long
Honey you got the touch
That heats my motor up
Take the keys to my heart
And drive it home
I don't know where this road is gonna lead us
But what a beautiful night for a drive
Baby put your mind at ease
Drop the top and feel the breeze
Just follow all the signs to paradise
Take the keys to my heart
And drive me crazy
I've been runnin' on empty way too long
All that work under the hood
Sure has got it runnin' good
Take the keys to my heart
And drive it home
Tonight we've gonna set these wheels on fire
And find out just how far this thing will go
Honey we don't need no map
'Cause where we are is where it's at
Take the keys to my heart
And drive it home
Baby makes my motor yearn
I love to feel that rubber burn
Take the keys to my heart
And drive it home
Drive it homeNext to Louisiana on the Texas side,
There's a little country joint where they let it ride.
There's a boogie woogie man on the piano,
An' all the backwoods boppers shoutin' "Go cat, go."
They've never been afraid of the Boogie Man.
Nothin' makes you feel better than the boogie woogie can.
So don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man:
He'll take you down to New Orleans where that rhythm all began.
So don't you,
Don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man.
Grandpa's in the corner in his fishing clothes,
Reelin' to the rhythm everywhere it goes.
All the boogie woogie babies tearing up the floor.
When they get a little bit, they want a little more.
They've never been afraid of the Boogie Man.
Nothin' makes you feel better than the boogie woogie can.
So don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man:
He'll take you down to New Orleans where that rhythm all began.
So don't you,
Don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man.
In a red El Dorado, at the break of day,
That Boogie Woogie man'll be slipping away.
Although you're never gonna know it when he's out of sight,
He'll shut a juke box down again tomorrow night.
He's never been afraid of the Boogie Man.
Nothin' makes you feel better than the boogie woogie can.
So don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man:
He'll take you down to New Orleans where that rhythm all began.
It works for me, it'll work for you,
He'll have you doin' things that you didn't know you knew.
So don't you,
Don't you be afraid.
No, don't ya,
Don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man, no.They say I'm like my daddy always on the roam
I know he love my mama but he couldn't stay at home
I vowed to not be like him but somewhere I went wrong
Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere and the girl I love at home
One of these days I'm gonna quit my wandering
One of these days I'll wander back to you
My sweetheart writes me letters they find me now and then
I've send her funny postcards to show her where I've been
She always writes I love you though we're miles apart
But none of funny postcards can't say what's in my heart
One of these days...
I feel the cold winds blowing blowing up a storm
I go to sleep and I always dream that you're here in my arms
And then a lonesome whistle starts blowin' down the line
Wake up boy my buddy says we're a long way from Caroline
One of these days...
One of these days I'll wander back to youI live in the world world of forgotten people
Who've loved and lost their hearts so many times
I'm here in the world world of forgotten people
Where every heart is aching just like mine
Well I've loved and I've been loved but I had the reckless heart
And the many dreams I had I torn apart
Now I find that I was wrong too late I'm all alone
Alone in the world of broken hearts
I live in the world world...
Where every heart is aching just like mine(When you feel like you're in love don't just stand there)
When you feel like you're in love don't just stand there
When you see that moon above don't just stand there
You gotta laugh dance and sing you gotta get that gal a ring
When you feel like you're in love don't just stand there
When the moon is shining bright in your Saturday night
You're not havin' any fun then maybe you ride with the wrong one
When you feel like you're in love hold her tighter
And the moon and stars above all shine brighter
You gotta laugh dance and sing...
[ guitar ]
You gotta laugh dance and sing...
When the moon is shining bright...
You gotta laugh dance and sing...'Tis sweet to be remembered on a bright or a gloomy day
'Tis sweet to be remembered by a dear one far away
'Tis sweet to be remembered, remembered, remembered
'Tis sweet to be remembered when you are far away
As I travel on this world just to soothe my rovin' mind
And the messages I get from a dear one left behind
They were filled with sweetest words that's so touch me when I heard
Never never can I forget these are some things that she said
'Tis sweet to be remembered on a bright or a gloomy day
'Tis sweet to be remembered by a dear one far away
'Tis sweet to be remembered, remembered, remembered
'Tis sweet to be remembered when you are far awayLaura hold these hands and count my fingers
Laura touch these lips you once desired
Lay your head upon my chest feel my heart beat
Gently run your fingers through my hair
Touch these ears that listened to your wishes most of them fullfilled and that's a lot
Let your soft gentle hands caress my body then tell me what he's got that I ain't got
Tell me what he's got that I can't give you must be something I was born without
You took an awful chance to be with another man
So tell me what he's got that I ain't got
Laura see these walls that I built for you Laura see this carpet that I layed
See those fancy curtains on the windows touch those satin pillows on your bed
Laura count the dresses in your closet
Note the name upon the checkbook in your bag
And if there's time before I pull this trigger
Then tell me what he's got that I ain't got
Tell me what he's got that I can't give you must be something I was born without
And if there's time before I pull this trigger
Then tell me what he's got that I ain't got
Then tell me what he's got that I ain't got
Then tell me what he's got that I ain't gotIf I was a gambler

For my Lord, for my LordIf we never meet again this side of heaven
As we struggle through this world and its strife
There's another meeting place somewhere in heaven by the side of the river of life
Where the charming roses bloom forever and where separation comes no more
If we never meet again this side of heaven I will meet you on that beautiful shore
Soon we'll come to the end of life's journey and perhaps we'll never meet anymore
Till we gather in heaven's bright city far away on that beautiful shore
Where the charming rosesI walk along the street of sorrow
The boulevard of broken dreams
Where gigolo and gigolette
Can take a kiss without regret
So they forget their broken dreams
You laugh tonight and cry tomorrow
When you behold your shattered schemes
Gigolo and gigolette
Wake up to find their eyes are wet
With tears that tell of broken dreams
Here is where you'll always find me
Always walking up and down
But I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town
The joy that you find here you borrow
You cannot keep it long it seems
Gigolo and gigolette
Still sing a song and dance along
The boulevard of broken dreams
Here is where you'll always find me
Always walking up and down
For I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town
The joy that you find here you borrow
You cannot keep it long it seems
But gigolo and gigoletteWell, I don't care if the sun don't shine
I don't care if the bells don't chime
Just as long as you love me
I don't care if the tops don't spin
I don't care if the gins won't gin
Just as long as you love me
So darling let it rain, let it snow
Let the cold north wind blow
Just as long as you love me
North or south, east or west
You know I will stand the test
Just as long as you love me
Well, I don't care if the birds don't sing
I don't care if the bells don't ring
Just as long as you love me
I don't care if the world don't turn
I don't care if the fire don't burn
Just as long as you love me
So darling let it rain, let it snow
Let the cold north wind blow
Just as long as you love me
North or south, east or west
You know I will stand the test
Just as long as you love me
Oh darling, just as long as you love meWell, I don't know what my uncle did
But he must have done it right
They sure strung him up one Saturday night
He had spent his whole life fussin'
Would have spent his last breath cussin'
'Til he realized the deal was really done
He started screamin' "hallelujah"
Tryin' to make his peace with everyone
Yeah, he was kickin' and screamin'
Just like he came in
He was kickin' and screamin', darlin'
Right to the bitter end
Ain't it funny how we come in kickin' giddyup
And go out hollerin' whoa
Lord, we never want to be here
Sure don't ever want to go
Well, I could hear those church bells ringin'
To my best friend I was clingin'
Screamin' "If you love me brother don't let me go"
Well then the whole scene was repeated
Two years later I begged and pleaded
Screamin' "If you love me, honey,
Now you know you wouldn't want to let me go"
No, I didn't want to do it
But I sure don't want to see it come undone
Yeah, I was kickin' and screamin'
Just like I came in
I was kickin' and screamin', darlin'
Right to the bitter end
Ain't it funny how we come in kickin' giddyup
And go out hollerin' whoa
Lord, we never want to be here
Sure don't ever want to go
Yeah, I was kickin' and screamin'
Just like I came in
I was kickin' and screamin', darlin'
Right to the bitter end
Ain't it funny how we come in kickin' giddyup
And go out hollerin' whoa
Seems, we never want to be here
Sure don't ever want to goWhenever she walks flowers grow in her footsteps
Whenever she talks all the birds hush their singing
The heart of a saint and the face of an angel
Absolutely unbelievably beautiful
And when this cruel world's been gettin' me down
She'll take my frown and she'll turn it back around
Like a clown, she'll crack a joke
Acting crazy as a fool
Absolutely unbelievably beautiful
(Chorus)
It'd be a big old fat lie, if I said I
Wasn't turned on just by her looks alone
She's so much more, so much more than meets the eye
She's an angel on loan from up aboveI'll follow you like a bridge to the end of the world
I take you with me everywhere I go girl
But you ran from love like a bullet from a gun
Lead powder burned my heart deep as this desert sun
You never told me it was over
You never told me anything at all
Now I'm out on the road and asking myself why
I never told you that my love was true
Well, I thought you knew
Yeah, I thought you knew
Heard it from the motel man, you were here two nights ago
That means I'm closing in on my last chance to let you know
That I'm sorry girl for the things I guess I didn't say
But I'll keep searching for you 'til my dying day
Now I'm out on the road and asking myself why
I never told you that my love was true
Well, I thought you knew
I thought you knew I meant forever
Even though I never said the things I needed to
But I'm out on the road and asking myself why
I'm out on the road and asking myself why
I never told you that my love was true
But I thought you knew, yeah I thought you knew
Girl, I thought you knew, yeah, I thought you knew
As the sunlight fades and the sky turns black from blue
I know one of those sets of taillights just might be youTo everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)
There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn)
And a time to every purpose, under Heaven
A time to be born, a time to die
A time to plant, a time to reap
A time to kill, a time to heal
A time to laugh, a time to weep
To everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)
There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn)
And a time to every purpose, under Heaven
A time to build up,a time to break down
A time to dance, a time to mourn
A time to cast away stones, a time to gather stones together
To everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)
There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn)
And a time to every purpose, under Heaven
A time of love, a time of hate
A time of war, a time of peace
A time you may embrace, a time to refrain from embracing
To everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)
There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn)
And a time to every purpose, under Heaven
A time to gain, a time to lose
A time to rend, a time to sew
A time for love, a time for hate
A time for peace, I swear it's not too lateYour life laid down, crucified.
Your arms stretched out and open wide.
To rescue me so I can be a child of God.
From nail pierced hands and thorn pierced brow
Your blood flows down to me somehow.
It cleanses me so I can be a child of God.
Praise to the lamb that was slain
Praise to the Father who gave His son away
The proof of love, the price of grace
You traded all to take my place
And died for me so I can be a child of GodBowling Green is the perfect place for girls to meet boys
Don't go skipping around
Where you're not invited
The man knows how to dress
Seen him in the Wall Street press
He's a toastable philanthropist
He's the chair of the company
He takes you to Palm beach
and now your wedding's arranged
The Royal hawaiian hotel
Billions in charities
Now your mothers in tears
Pacing through the kitchen hears
Your name on the Fox Five news
and a fraud investigation
Turn on the tv, its your daughter Mrs. Kain
Turn on the tv, its your daughter Mrs. Kain
How could it end this way, never could tell
at the royal hawaiian hotel
Panama all the way to Anaheim
that's where the Giants sleep
A boy in a Bentley
A party of the political elite
Posing on the tenth hole green
Hungry for a photograph with the man of a century
Turn on the tv, it's your daughter Mr. Kain
Turn on the tv, it's your daughter Mrs. Kain
how could it end this way, never could tell
at the royal hawaiian hotel
Why did it end this way
How did it end this way, Mr Kain
How did it end this way
How did it end this way, Mr. Kain
How did it end this way, Mr. Kain
How did it end this way, Mr. KainWhen we dance together my world's in disguise it's a fairyland tale that come true
And when you look at me with those stars in your eyes
I could waltz across Texas with you
Waltz across Texas with you in my arms waltz across Texas with you
Like a storybook ending I'm lost in your charms
And I could waltz across Texas with you
My heartaches and troubles are just up and gone the moment that you come in view
And with your hand in mine dear I could dance on and on
And I could waltz across Texas with you
Waltz across TexasIt's one am
And he's still not in
You wonder when enough's enough
'Cause this ain't new
But what do you do
When you can't help who you love
So you drive to town
And you ask around
Scared of what you're thinking of
Has he been hurt
Has be been with her
'Cause you can't help who you love
You hear the voices calling
As you walk among the fallen and betrayed
And you know it's gonna break you
Still you follow where it takes you anyway
'Cause you ain't got no say
It's a long ride home
When you're all alone
'Cause you can't help who you love
You hear the voices calling
As you walk among the fallen and betrayed
And you know it's gonna break you
Still you follow where it takes you anyway
'Cause you ain't got no say
You should leave
But I believe
You can't help who you loveWell I never felt nothing like I did tonight
You had the face of a boy that I met in a dream one time
Some heard it thunder and so did I
I swear it happened when your eyes met mine
Maybe it was just the way the wind blew
Maybe it was God and his son too
But in that moment I know that I knew that I,
I found you
I saw a light I,
Heard a bell
You were the very best feeling that I ever felt
And suddenly you are standing here, mine all mine well
I saw a light I, saw a light
Well I still can't believe someone left you laying around
Something precious like you should have already been found
What if I'd stayed home and done nothing tonight
What if you had looked left and I had looked right
For once in our lives we were both on time and now
I found you
I saw a light I
Heard a bell
You were the very best feeling that I ever felt
And suddenly you are standing here,
Mine all mine well
I saw a light I
Saw
Somebody told me
When I was younger
Chance is like lightning
Love is like thunder
So I walked right over
Asked for your number
'Cause somebody told me when I was younger
I saw a light I
Heard a bell
You were the very best feeling, that I ever felt
And suddenly you are standing here before my eyes
The thunder in my heart it tells me, you are mine well
I saw a light I
Saw
A lightYou left your Bible on the dresser
So I put it in the drawer
'Cause I can't seem to talk to God without yelling anymore
And when I sit at your piano
I can almost hear those hymns
The keys are just collecting dust
But I can't close the lid
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith and now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
"Things are only getting worse"
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
The preacher came by Sunday
Said he missed me at the service
He told me Jesus loves me
But I'm not sure I deserve it
'Cause the faithful man that you loved
Is nowhere to be found
Since they took all that he believed
And laid it in the ground
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith and now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
"Things are only getting worse"
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
I still believe in Heaven
And I'm sure you've made it there
But as for me without your love, girl
I don't have a prayer
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith and now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
"Things are only getting worse"
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
You left your Bible on the dresser
So I put it in the drawer.I got a letter from my mama just a line or two
She said listen daddy your good girl's leavin' you
That's all she wrote didn't write no more
She'd left the gloom a hanging round my front door
Now I woke up this morning a quarter past three
I just couldn't realize this could happen to me
That's all she wrote
Now listen pretty mama you know you done me wrong
Didn't even give a warning till after you were gone
That's all you wrote
Now someday you'll be sorry your heart will ache with pain
You'd give a million dollars to write that note again
That's all you wrote
Now listen all you ramblers who think your girl is true
Don't ever be too certain or you'll be singing too
That's all she wroteDON'T THINK I DON'T LOVE YOU

Your old cheatin' heart has finally caught you
A thousand times I told you that it would
A great big wall has come between us
And I wouldn't even love you if I could
So don't think it ain't been fun cause it ain't
Don't think I still can't care cause I can't
Don't think my mind won't change cause it won't
Don't think I don't love you cause I don't
Well all my tossing and turning nights are over
I don't even feel a touch of blues
Once more I can see the sun a shining
Shining though I know I'm over you
So don't think it ain't been fun cause it ain't...
Don't think I don't love you cause I don't
ONCE A DAY

When I found somebody new I thought I never would
Forget you for I thought then I never could
But time has taken all the pains away
Until now I'm down to hurtin' once a day
Once a day all day long
And once a night from dusk till dawn
The only time I wish you weren't gone
Is once a day every day all day long
I'm so glad that I'm not like a guy I knew one time
He lost the one he loved then slowly lost his mind
He sat around and cried his life away
Lucky me I'm only crying once a day
Once a day all day long...
Once a day every day all day long

Oh the promise of tomorrow will banish all your sorrow
No need to grieve if you believe
There will be a brighter future and a way prepared
To suit your every need if you believe
If you believe so will it be it's true for you it's true for me
Somewhere down that narrow road he'll relieve your heavy load
Life's supreme reward receive if you believe
If your life is not inspiring and your days are long and tiring
Rest receive when you believe
Nothing here below can measure up to heaven's lasting treasure
Be not deceived only believe
If you believe so will it be...

Well the two new people that's moved to the middle of the block
And we're at the top of the town and don't you think we're not
For we got love and happiness people envy us you see
For we found heaven right here on earth at at 4-0-33
Yes we found what most people are looking for
And it's not a lotta money to spend on a real fine car
But it's so when and where a bird flies and sings so free
And there's whole lotta winds in this little house at 4-0-33
The four thousandth block proves what true love can do
Once a lonely place but was sold to me and you
Oh all around the house you can see little children play
And they're not as a people's kids were proud to say
They are the symbol of our love for all the world to see
They're a part of heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33
And our love's on the day you can see many people drive by
For look at the house they think they fell from the sky
They say that this place would make them as happy as you and me
And the whole town's tryin' to buy our house at 4-0-33
The four thousandth block...
Oh all around the house you can see little children play...
We're not gonna sale our happy little house at 4-0-33
Wouldn't take a pretty thing for the love we had at 4-0-33
I DON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE

I don't love you anymore like the way I did before
And since you've found someone new I think it's best
I don't try and walk the floor I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less
I don't love you anymore for I've got no more love to give
You drained my heart of all its love with every sweet caress
I keep saying o'er and o'er I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less
I held you close to me one time I kissed your lips and called you mine
But another came and thrilled you more I guess
I cried as you walked out the door I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less
I don't love you anymore...
Trouble is I don't love you any less

There's a secret behind the smile you see
For this smile is just a part of me
But I know some can't see the signs
That show I'm hurtin' all the time
And the lonely know my secret they know you're on my mind
There's a secret behind the lies you tell
For inside is where the sorrow lies
Cause I'm living like the lonely do
For they've lost someone they love too
And the lonely know my secret they know what I go through
There's a secret behind the smile you see...
Yes the lonely know my secret they know I still love you

Â« Â© '66 Blue Crest Music Â»
We both have a morning cup of coffee
And with tender love you reach and touch my hand
And my son comes in and says good morning daddy
And I say how's daddy's little man
Then I woke up from dreaming I woke up from dreaming
I keep dreaming you're not gone but I'd found myself alone
When I woke up from dreaming
We're both making plans for the future
Of the joy that we want to give our son
We'd say almost enough to buy a new home
A home filled with love and fun
Then I woke up from dreaming...
Then I woke up from dreaming
OLD BRUSH ARBORS
(Darrell Edwards - G. Ardis)
Â« Â© '66 Glad Music Â»
(Old Brush Arbors by the of the road)
I remember them so clearly mom and dad loved them so dearly
Old brush arbors by the side of the road
Where I learned about salvation from the book of revelations
In an arbor by the side of the road
Old brush arbors by the side of the road
Where a sinner could lay down his heavy load
It was in those old brush arbors troubled souls found peaceful harbors
Brush arbors by the side of the road
Many times I have departed from the way of life I started
In an arbor by the side of the road
But each time the devil's caught me I remembered what they taught me
In brush arbors by the side of the road
Old brush arbors by the side of the road
Where the mighty light of God's great mercy fload
There was prayin' shoutin' singin' till the country side was ringin'
Brush arbors by the side of the road
Old brush arbors by the of the roadNobody thinks about that stuff like how tall
He might have been or how fast he could've run
They just stare as he rolls by, all they see is a helpless kid
With no chance to live a life but If they only knew
He's got dreams of breaking ribbons in a hundred yard dash
Climbing up a snow capped mountain and planting his flag
He believes one day he'll stand up and walk away from that chair
He's got faith, he's got hope and all his mamma's prayers
He's not jaded or bitter, gonna leave the giving up for the quitters
The doctors say no way he'll walk, he just smiles
And says, 'I'm gonna prove you wrong'
Lots of falls and failed attempts, his legs keep giving out
But his heart ain't giving in 'cause what they don't know
He's got dreams of breaking ribbons in a hundred yard dash
Pushing Earnhardt down the back stretch in a Daytona draft
He believes one day he'll stand up and walk away from that chair
He's got faith, he's got hope and all his mamma's prayers
He's not jaded or bitter, he's gonna leave the giving up for the quitters
He pulls himself up on the bars
And takes a long deep breath
Lifts his right foot off the mat
And with all that he has left
He takes a step, one step
Toward his dream of breaking ribbons in a hundred yard dash
Going long for a touchdown with his buddies out back
He believes one day he'll stand up and walk away from that chair
He's got faith, he's got hope and all his mamma's prayers
He's not jaded or bitter, he's gonna leave the giving up for the quitters
He ain't no quitterYou've been taken by the wind
You have known the kiss of sorrows
Doors that would not take you in
Outcast and a stranger
You have come by way of sorrow you have come by way of tears
But you'll reach your destiny meant to find you all these years
Meant to find you all these years
You have drunk a bitter wine with none to be your comfort
You who once were left behind will be welcome at love's tables
You have come by way of sorrow you have come by way of tears
But you'll reach your destiny
Meant to find you all these years
Meant to find you all these years
You will one day come to know
You will one day come to know
All the nights that joy has slept will awake to days of laughter
Eone the tears that you have wept
You'll dance in freedom ever after
You have come by way of sorrow you have come by way of tears
But you'll reach your destiny
Meant to find you all these years
Meant to find you all these yearsWritten by Billy Burnette and Michael Smotherman.
I was laughing at all these people, who
Jump through hoops and loop de loop
In the name of love
I told all my friends this could never
Happen to me
'Cause bein' free was all this boy was
Thinkn' of
Then one night I met this woman
Who set my soul on fire
Now I'm a liar
Well I can't control these crazy feelin's
I found my heart is not my own
I'm in the danger zone
I'm in the danger zone
I'm in the danger zone
You got me in the danger zone
Now bells are ringin'
And lights are flashin'
Danger - look out boy
'Cause love is everywhere
Now all of my friends - now they're all
Laughin'
I jump through hoops and loop de loop
But I don't care
'Cause one night I met this woman
Who set my soul on fire
Now I'm a liar
Well I can't control these crazy feelin's
I found my heart is not my own
I'm in the danger zone
I'm in the danger zone
You got me in the danger zone
I'm in the danger zoneOkay I forgot about the trash
I didn't trim the long hairs on my mustache
I didn't buy you a ring I believe it was back in '93
Alright I admit it I forgot our anniversary
I didn't pick the baby this morning at the nursery
That ain't no big thing but it's a gold star for me
You get tired and disgusted with me
But I can't be just what you want me to be
I still love you and I try real hard
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car
I even asked God to try to help me
He looked down from Heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient, I'm a work in progress
I'm sorry I was mad for waiting in the truck
It seemed like hours you getting all dressed up
Just to go to Shoney's on a Wednesday night
I read that book you gave me about Mars and Venus
I think it's soaking in but probably need to re-read it
But I can see now what you've been saying is right
You get tired and disgusted with me
But I can't be just what you want me to be
I still love you and I try real hard
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car
I even asked God to try to help me
He looked down from Heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient, I'm a work in progress
I got laid off and we're behind on our bills
I can't cross that picket line down at the mill
I may not have money but I've got my pride
Yeah I know Christmas is just around the corner
And all my love can't keep us any warmer
But look at the bright side
We're both still alive
You get tired and disgusted with me
But I can't be just what you want me to be
I still love you and I try real hard
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car
I even asked God to try to help me
He looked down from Heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient, I'm a work in progress
Oh honey just be patient now
I'm a work in progressFrom the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
From the queen of flowing mountains to the south bells by the moor
She's mighty tall and handsome and known quite well by all
She's the combination on the Wabash Cannonball
She came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
There's a gal from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodlands through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear that lonesome hobo's call
Traveling through the Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball
Our eastern states are dandy so the people always say
From New York to St Louis and Chicago by the way
From the hills of Minnesota where the rippling waters fall
No changes can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball
So here's to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
And always be remembered in the ports of Alabama
His earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall
We'll carry him home to Victory on the Wabash Cannonball
Now listen to the jingle [unverified]I know I hurt you but I never meant to
It's you that I'm fondest of
I know you need me but I must be free
Cowboys ain't easy to love
Somethings that I do, I know don't please you
My ways are rowdy and rough
Don't try to change me, you can't rearrange me
Cowboys ain't easy to love
Somewhere tonight in the rain and the wind
I'll be searching for something and dreaming again
Chasin' a rainbow that has no end
Cowboys ain't easy to love
The bright lights may blind me and sometimes I can't see
Just how much I need your love
Lord it ain't easy but I'd die if you leave me
Cowboys ain't easy to love
Somewhere tonight in the rain and the wind
I'll be searching for something and dreaming again
Chasin' a rainbow that has no end
Cowboys ain't easy to love
Somewhere tonight in the rain and the wind
I'll be searching for something and dreaming again
Chasin' a rainbow that has no end
Cowboys ain't easy to love
Somewhere tonight in the rain and the wind
I'll be searching for something and dreaming again
Chasin' a rainbow that has no end
Cowboys ain't easy to loveI came home the other night the door was open wide
And as a joke I thought I'd try to sneak inside
I heard a voice from the kitchen one I never heard before
Saying come my dear and go with me you don't need him anymore
I thought I'd die when I heard his voice so clear
I didn't know I could cry but I'm one big walking tear
And fear hung over me like a cloud when I heard him say out loud
Come my dear and go with me you don't need him anymore
A single thought ran through my head I'd rather see the stranger dead
Than to know that he could take my love away
I drew a pistol from the draw and I shot him to the floor
I heard her cry and then I heard her say
You just killed my brother Jim who begged me to go with him
Cause I told him of the troubles that we've had
And after all that we've been through I've said I still love you
And I told him all your good outweight the bad
I thought I'd die when I heard her voice so clear
I didn't know I could cry but I'm one big walking tear
Now fear hangs over me like a cloud as the warden says out loud
Come my son and go with me you don't live here anymoreThere's a little boy at our house who's as happy as can be
Cause he's always doing something keeping busy as a bee
He can make believe he's anyone or almost anything
And that is why we call him Little Johnny Everything
This imagination takes him anyplace or anywhere
If he wants to be an engineer he gets the part of chair
Then he climbs aboard and blows a whistle gives the bell a ring
It's clear the track the clickety clack I'm Johnny Everything
When he wants to be a fireman it's clang clang clang
As a fire engine raise around the floor
Ebveryone wants to be a cowboy then it's bang bang bang
As he chases all the engines out the door
When his busy day is over and he's tucked up in his bed
Little Johnny is so tired and he's such a sleepy head
So he makes believe he's in a boat and to himself you'll sing
I'm sailing off to dreamland Little Johnny Everything
(When he wants to be an aeroplaneed zoom
As he makes the perfect landing on the floor)
If he wants to be a soldier then it's boom boom boom
As he shoots his cannons off to win a war
And when I come home from working and my weary day is through
And my little make beliver says come on I'll play with you
And he throuws his arms around me and he bounces on my knee
That's when Little Johnny Everything means everything to meOnce more to be with you, dear
Just for tonight to hold you tight
Once more I'd give a fortune
If I could see you once more
Forget the past, this hurt can't last
So I don't want it to keep us apart
Your love I need say, you'll love me and say
You'll give me all of your heart
Once more to be with you
Once more to be with youWhere did we go when the blue sky turned to liquid?
And the cold trees stood naked all up high on the mountain
We were growing up
So strong
I have found a flower that is growing in the forest
And we talked by the hours
We weren't lovers
But I loved you, oh love
And oh beautiful clouds
I go sailing through
Oh golden clouds
I've been sailing through you
Well my mother was a garden of all things
Unspoken
And my father came around me like a hurricane
That I'll soldier ?
And my sister she is wondering
what hell is all around here
But there's beauty
All around
But there's beauty
All around
What you do is sacred
And what you say doesn't matter much
You're moving your lips
But your mind is on fire
Ah the steam is rising
I did once, I
Love came right through me from above
And I sang up to my god
And it saved me once again
If you have brothers then you can understand
What it is to love and grow up to love
Things get shattered
And oh beautiful clouds
I go sailing through
Oh golden clouds
I've been sailing through you.I will miss you when you go much more than you'll ever know
But I'll have a memory to keep you near
In my heart you will remain but it just won't be the same
I will miss the million things that make you dear
Your lovely ways make you so sweet I prayed the angels fair will keep
You're happiness so you'll be blessed just as you deserve to be
And as you travel all your way just remember that each day
Someone thinks of you and hopes you're happy dear
(I just want myself aside to somewhere dear where you are
To guide your rainbow to eternity)
And when it's shining from above it will sparkle down with love
In all its glory for the world to see
(I wonder darling where you are the happiness you have in mind)
Your treasured chest will be the best cause it's filled with God's sunshine
I wonder why there are so few lovely people just like you
My but I will surely miss you when you goWon't you tell me Molly darling that you love none else but me
For I love you Molly darling you are all the world to me
Oh tell me darling that you love me put your little hand in mine
Take my heart sweet Molly darling say you'll always be just mine
Stars are shining Molly darling through a misty veil of night
They seem laughing Molly darling while they seem to hide their light
Oh no one listens but the flowers while they hang their heads in shame
They are modest Molly darling when they hear me call your name
Molly there is sweetest dearest look up darling tell me this
Do you love me Molly darling let your answer be a kissIt's been a blue, blue day, I feel like running away
I feel like running away from it all
My love has been untrue, she's found her, somebody new
It's been a blue, blue day for me
I feel like crying, dying, what can I do?
I feel like praying, saying, I'm glad we're through
It's been a blue, blue day, I feel like running away
I feel like running away from the blues
How can I make believe, that I don't sit and grieve?
It's been a blue, blue day for me
I can't pretend and say, that I don't love her anyway
It's been a blue, blue day for me
I feel like crying, dying, what can I do?
I feel like praying, saying, I'm glad we're through
It's been a blue, blue day, I feel like running away
I feel like running away from the blues
I feel like running away from the bluesI've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation coming around
I guess its right, it's so amazing
Every time I see you I'm alive
You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes
I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
I wanna be earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
When we touch, when we love
The stars light up
The wrong becomes undone
Naturally, my soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathing in
A soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holdin' you until the day I die
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
I wanna be earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
Oh yes I do
I wanna be inside your heavenYou're dancing with the crowd in the city of lights
All the boys spin around you like satellites
Be the spark in their hearts, say goodnight
Then you're gone.
You keep your toes on the ledge of the line you've drawn
Looking over the edge but you don't fall
Bet you got a lot of numbers you don't call
You're never and always alone.
(If you ever)
If you're ever gonna love someone then
Maybe you can love someone like me
(If you ever)
Baby if you ever do stop rollin'
Maybe you can love someone like me
I can barely breathe in your cloud of dust
My skin's still burnt from one more touch
Oh but one more touch is never enough
You see.
I will run with you through an ancient town
Gonna lay with you on sacred ground
Do you see that I could be the type
That never ties you down?
(If you ever)
If you're ever gonna love someone then
Maybe you can love someone like me
(If you ever)
Baby if you ever do stop rollin'
Maybe you can love someone like me
Someone like me
Oh, you're just a dot on that horizon line
I can't hold on to what was never mine
But it ain't what left behind
That won't let me sleep.
(If you ever, if you ever)
If you're ever gonna love someone then
Maybe you can love someone like me
(If you ever)
Oh baby if you ever do stop rollin'
Maybe you can love someone like me
Someone like meThere ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe it don't matter nayhow
And there ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe if you don't know by now
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn look out your window I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm traveling on don't think twice it's all right
Ain't no use in turnin' on your light babe a light I'll never know
Ain't no use in turnin' on your light babe I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway don't think twice it's all right
[ ac.guitar ]
I'm walkin' down that long lonesome road babe where I'm bound I can't tell
But goodbye is too good a word gal so I'll just say fare thee well
Now I ain't seeing you treated me unkind you could have done better but I don't mind
You just sorta wasted my precious time don't think twice it's all right
Don't think twice it's all rightIf you ask me if I'm happy
For I have peace within
If I'm worried about tomorrow
When I reach my journey's end
I'm satisfied with my Jesus
When he knocks I let him in
He'll go with me through the valley
For I know he is my friend
[Chorus:]
Satisfied, Satisfied
No trouble can ever get me down
When my eyes shall close in death
With my Jesus I'll be at rest
Then you'll know I'm satisfied
When my friends all forsake me
When they turn me from their door
If they sow no seeds of kindness
Make the thorns in my path grow
It won't matter over yonder
When I reach the other side
I'm gonna sit down with my Jesus
And then you'll know I'm satisfiedI turned around
Before I could run I found you already settled down in the back of my mind
I know this is just a customary feelin'
The moon is our deceiver that will leave you running blind
Your heart is pullin'
If I didn't know any better
I'd be fallin'
Deeper and deeper it's true
I'd hear it callin'
If I didn't know any better
And I'd be in love with you
Didn't want to
Look in the eyes of the one that I would be drawn to
I'm a moth lost in a fire
And I know this is just a beautiful illusion,
A case of the confusion, between love and desire
Your heart is pullin'
If I didn't know any better
I'd be fallin'
Deeper and deeper it's true
I'd hear it callin'
If I didn't know any better
And I'd be in love
When the flame burns out
And fine'ly settles down
And you'd forget I ever came around
Your heart is pullin'
If I didn't know any better
I'd be fallin'
Deeper and deeper it's true
I'd hear it callin'
If didn't know any better
And I'd be in love with you
I turned around
Before I could run I found you already settled down in the back of my mind"You know I'm really gonna miss you, sugar britches"
"I'm gonna miss you too, Bub"
"Now I'm only gonna be gone a few days
But now there is a few things I need you to do while I'm gone"
"Oh, I figured there's somethin'!"
"Oh, quit complainin'"
"All you gotta do is cut the grass, wash the car, trim the hedges
Paint the fence, clean the pool, give the dog a bath
Defrost the fridge, clean out the garage"
"Right"
"Sweep the chimney, and I'll see you on Monday
I love you boogie, boogie"
"I love you too an' you, you don't you worry 'bout me, I'll be just fine"
I've got my socks dryin' in the microwave
Hair on my back I don't plan to shave
I've got the house to myself while the wife's away
I'll be rockin' all night
Yeah, I think I'll drink me an ice cold brew
Lounge in my boxers like I used to do
There'll be no Ally McBeal on the tube, no
I'll be watchin' the fight
Well, it's a great day to be a guy
Played cards with my buddies until sunrise
You know, I never thought that my neighbor would
Be sunbathing topless, Lord, she sure looks good
I caught a 10 pound bass out on the lake
Played 18 holes with my best friend, Jake
Best balls I hit was when I stepped on a rake
Oh, well it wasn't too bright
Now I look in the fridge, what do I see?
Last night's pizza starin' back at me
Pepperoni and anchovies
What a beautiful sight
Well, it's a great day to be a guy
Buck naked in my lawn chair swattin' at flies
Got some hot dogs on the charcoal grill
I don't wanna burn my wieners but I probably will
That fried baloney and cheese macaroni
Tasted good this afternoon
But now I'm passin' some serious gas and
I might have to leave the room
Pee hee!
Well, I might go get me a new hairdo
Spend a couple hours in a tanning booth
Might even get me a gold front tooth
Whoa, hah, yeah!
And it's a great day to be a guy
But when my wife gets home, she's gonna tan my hide
I'll be hung over but a lookin' good
From a week of reliving my bachelorhood
It's a great day to be a guy
But another week of this and I'd probably die
I tend to party harder than I should
When my wife's not here to make me be good
Yeah hoo!Oh, when you're leaving for the hundredth time of day
Looking for a reason, a reason lived to stay
What about the promises, the promises you can't keep?
Sometimes when you're wounded, there ain't enough reason to bleed
Oh don't hurry your heart
No, don't hurry your heart
Please don't hurry your heart
This time
Now you're really going like a hundred times before
Is there any reason not to step through that door?
Forget about the promises, the promises you can't keep
When you look behind you there's nothing there to see
Oh don't hurry your heart
No, don't hurry your heart
Please don't hurry your heart
This time
Flashing lights and exit signs, fall away into the night
Like everything you couldn't take with you
There's nothing left to break
Everybody's talking
When you want to say your piece
Everybody's leavin'
Right when you were feeling at ease
Sometimes when he's rushing
He's telling you to hurry up
Oh don't hurry your heart
No, don't hurry your heart
Please don't hurry your heart
This time
La da da da da da
Yeah, yeah
La da da da da daWhen I saw you standing there on the street
I found myself by your side
I started wanting you again
There's just no way to hide
From that old loving you feeling again
It's really got me reeling again
It only seems to stop
To start all over again with you
I remember how you'd always been
That certain look in your eyes
You're not easy to resist
But I just walked on by
With that old lovin' you feelin' again
It's really got me reelin' again
Only seems to stop
To start all over again with you
Lovin' you feelin' with you
We were so close we were too far apart
I gave you my love, I wanted your heart
Without yesterday haunting the way
Maybe we'd still be together
Sharin' that lovin' you feelin' again
It's really got me reelin' again
Will it ever stop and not start over again
That lovin' you feelin' again
No matter how much I try
This lovin' you feelin' is right
It's taken such a long long time to say goodbye
And getting over you is so hard to do
With this feelin', lovin' you
That loving you feelin' again
Lovin' you feelin' again
That lovin' you feelin' again
Lovin' you feelin' again
That lovin' you feelin' again
Lovin' you feelin' again
That lovin' you feelin' againIf I needed you would you come to me
Would you come to me for to ease my pain
If you needed me I would come to you
I would swim the seas for to ease your pain
Well the night's forlorn and the morning's born
And the morning shines with the lights of love
And you'll miss sunrise if you close your eyes
And that would break my heart in two
If I needed you would you come to me
Would you come to me for to ease my pain
If you needed me I would come to you
I would swim the seas for to ease your pain
Baby's with me now since I showed her how
To lay her lilly hand in mine
Who would I'll agree she's a sight to see
A treasure for the poor to findWhen I get where I'm going
On the far side of the sky
The first thing that I'm gonna do
Is spread my wings and fly
I'm gonna land beside a lion
And run my fingers through his mane
Or I might find out what it's like
To ride a drop of rain
Yeah, when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah, when I get where I'm going
Don't cry for me down here
I'm gonna walk with my grandaddy
And he'll match me step for step
And I'll tell him how I missed him
Every minute since he left
Then I'll hug his neck
Yeah, when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah, when I get where I'm going
Don't cry for me down hereYou're running wild
How long can this go on?
You're leaving me alone
Stop running wild
You're always gone
My love you'll never change
It's more than I can bear
Stop running wild
You'll settle down someday
And find I've gone away
You'll think of what you've done
While running wild
You can't go home
You'll have to change your ways
You'll have to go or stay
Stop running wildWell they'll stone you when you're tryin' to be so good
They'll stone you just a like they said they would
They'll stone you when you're tryin' to go home
They'll stone you when you're left all alone
I would not feel so all alone everybody must get stoned
They'll stone you when you're walkin' long the street
They'll stone you when you're tryin' to keep your seat
They'll stone you when you're walkin' on the foor
They'll stone you when you're walkin' to the door
I would not feel so all alone everybody must get stoned
[ banjo ]
They'll stone you when you say that it's the end
They'll stone you and then you'll come back again
They'll stone you when you're ridin' in your car
They'll stone you when you're playin' your guitar
I would not feel so all alone everybody must get stoned all right oh yesI see a million old memories each day
That remind me of what used to be
My aching heart tells me they are here to stay
Since you made a memory of me
I tossed and I turned night after night
Those memories just won't let me sleep
The flame in my heart is still burning bright
Though you made a memory of me
I passed by the house we once loved in
For a glimpse of what I thought was our dream
But these days I find the dream was all mine
Cause you made a memory of me
I passed by the house we once loved in
For a glimpse of what I thought was our dream
But these days I find the dream was all mine
Cause you made a memory of meI'm an old cowhand from the Rio Grande
But my legs ain't bowed and my cheeks ain't tan
I'm a cowboy who never saw a cow
Never roped a steer cause I don't know how
Sure ain't a fixin to start in now
Yippie yi yo kayah
I'm an old cowhand and I come down from the Rio Grande
And I learned to ride, ride, ride 'fore I learned to stand
I'm a riding fool who is up to date
I know every trail in the Lone Star State
Cause I ride the range in a Ford V-8
Yippie yi yo kayah
We're old cowhands from the Rio Grande
And we come to town just to hear the band
We know all the songs that the cowboys know
'Bout the big corral where the doggies go
We learned them all on the radio
Yippie yi yo kayah
I'm an old cowhand
Oh yes, Mr. Bing.
Too hot for you, Uncle Fudd?
Down from the Rio Grande
Oh where the west is wild all around the borderland
Where the buffalo roam around the zoo
and the Injuns run up a rug or two
and the old Bar X is just a barbecue, yeah
Yippie yi yo kayah
I'm a pioneer who began from scratch
I don't bat an eye in a shootin' match.
They don't call me Elmer, they call me Satch.
Yippie yi yo kayah
Yippie yi yo kayah
Get along little horsy
Get along little horsy
Yippie yi yo kayah, oh!Woke up this morning happy as could be look out my window what did I see
Comin' up my sidewalk was as big as day
Oh well here comes trouble that I never thought I'd see when you went away
Hello trouble come on in
Well you talk about heartaches where the world you've been
I ain't had the mis'ry since you've been gone
Well hello trouble trouble trouble welcome home
We'll make a cup of coffee and you can rest your shoes
And you can tell me them sweet lies and I'd listen to you
For I'm just a little part of all the life you've lived
But I'd rather have a little bit of trouble than to never know the love you give
Hello trouble come on in
Hello trouble trouble trouble welcome home(Blaise Tosti/Bud Reneau)
Though the sun may be dawning
You're the one that lights the morning
As I awake to the heaven
Of your sweet summer lovin'
By a stream in the country
Running barefoot and feeling free
While the love in our hearts blend
Into sweet summer lovin'
Sweet summer lovin' in the dandelions
Sweet summer lovin' keeps me high as candy wine
When that big red balloon sets
Like a painting across the West
As the sky turns a crimson blue
As the world turns for me and you
By the light of the moon glowing
While the warm summer wind blows
'Cross the sill of your window
We'll be letting our love flow
Sweet summer lovin' in the dandelions
Sweet summer lovin' keeps me high as candy wine
Sweet summer lovin' in the dandelions
Sweet summer lovin' keeps me high as candy wine
Sweet summer lovin'
Sweet summer lovin'
Mmm...
Sweet summer lovin'
Mmm...
Sweet summer lovin'
I love your sweet summer lovin'
Sweet summer lovin'
Sweet summer lovin'
Mmm...
Sweet summer lovin'
Mmm...
Sweet summer lovin'We slipped into the room I sometimes borrowed for just such an occasion
I dimmed the lights to set the mood and turned the music soft for making love
I went about the usual things like assuring her that she was still a lady
But deep inside I knew that it was passion that I was thinking of
Then somewhere around midnight with her in my arms
A feeling took hold of me I had no warning of
Somewhere around midnight with unspoken words
I began to feel passion slip into love
Suddenly I found myself whispering these words to her I love you
The future was racin' through my head as I made plans of things that we would do
The tightness of her arms was her answer to my only question
Did she feel the same as I and forever would her love for me be true
Yes somewhere around midnight...Baby when you're down
I'll be around
Baby when you're lost
I'll be your found
When the night is long
I'll be the crack of dawn
Baby when you take a shot
I'll be your sweet spot
Baby when you need to float
I'll be your lifeboat
When you want to play along
I'll be your Mah Jong
When you've done your best
I'll be your day of rest
Baby when you take a shot
I'll be your sweet spot
I'll be your sweet spot
Baby when you're falling off your feet
Out on a road that's rough and steep
And you're looking for a state of grace
I'll be your leap of faith
Baby when you're growing old
I'll be your solid gold
When your ship don't come in
I'll be your thick and thin
When your love is blind
I'll be your walk the line
When you've given all you've got
I'll be your sweet spotNo matter what I say or do
You're never satisfied
I've tried to please you too many times
So now I'm leaving you now goodbye
Riding on that midnight train
Lord my head's a hanging low
These awful blues will follow me
Wherever I may go
Why on earth was I ever born
I'll never understand
To fall in love with a girl like you
Who's in love with another man
Riding on that midnight train
Lord my head's a hanging low
These awful blues will follow me
Wherever I may go
You broke a heart that trusted you
Why wasn't it made of stone
You've left my world as black as night
And yet I must travel on
Riding on that midnight train
Lord my head's a hanging low
These awful blues will follow me
Wherever I may goJust you know why
Why you and I
Will by and by
Know true love ways
Sometimes we'll sigh
Sometimes we'll cry
And you know why
Just you and I know true love ways
Throughout the days
Our true love ways
Will bring us joys to share
With those who really care
Sometimes we'll sigh
And sometimes we'll cry
And you know why
Just you and I know true love ways
Throughout the days
Our true love ways
Will bring us joys to share
With those who really care
Sometimes we'll sigh
And sometimes we'll cry
And you know why
Just you and I know true love waysMy lady love, she stands a'waitin'
Far across the wide Missouri
On the banks I hear her callin' to me
A-roll, a-rollaree
Across the wide Missouri
A-roll, a-rollaree
Across the wide Missouri
For seven years I've been a-roamin'
Seven years I left the valley
Now I live just for my true love to see
A-roll, a-rollaree
Across the wide Missouri
A-roll, a-rollaree
Across the wide Missouri
I'm pushin' on when dawn's a-breakin'
Goin' 'cross the wide Missouri
Where my love, she stands a-waitin' for me
A-roll (a-rollaree)
A-rollaree
Across the wide Missouri
A-roll (a-rollaree)
A-rollaree
Across the wide MissouriI'd give anything to go back
Do anything to go there
To take my breath away again
I still see your face right there
Staring at me and I swear
I can feel you here
When I close my eyes
I know I should drop everything
And run straight back to your side
Maybe I should take a bus ride
Maybe I should put this car in drive
And go find the love that we both used to know
Maybe I can find the one way
Maybe you'll forgive me someday
No red lights stopping me
Nothing gonna slow me down
Starting now
Every step, every turn that I take
Every thought, every move that I make
Brings me closer to you
If the day is done and I haven't found you
I'll take my love and turn around
Go down another road and try again
Yea, try again
Maybe I should take a bus ride
Maybe I should put this car in drive
And go find the love that we both used to know
Maybe I can find the one way
Maybe you'll forgive me someday
No red lights stopping me
Nothing gonna slow me down
Starting now
I'm gonna find a new way to love you
I'm gonna find the one way to hold you
Cuz I just can't stay
Sitting around
Waitin on love to come back around
Back around
Maybe I should take a bus ride
Maybe I should put this car in drive
And go find the love that we both used to know
Maybe I can find the one way
Maybe you'll forgive me someday
No red lights stopping me
Nothing gonna slow me down
Yea, no red lights stopping me
Never gonna slow me down
Starting now
Yea, starting now
I'm headin for ya baby
Starting now
I'm gonna find ya baby
Startin now
Ooooo
OooooDon't call me anymore, by now you know the score
By now you know I'm not what I seem to be
Too much you loved and too much I deceived
I think it's best to forget me
Yes, I'm the one who lied used every alibi
Down deep inside, I think that you're really you
I must confess to you, oh can't you see?
Ah, I think it's best to forget me
Oh, I had no right to do the things I did I know
Should have told you this a long long time ago
No longer can I hide the hurt I feel inside
No longer can I live with this misery
Too much you loved and too much I deceived
I think it's best to forget me
Yes, I think it's best to forget meI won't say he won't ever stumble
But I'm clinging to my baby's hand
I won't say he won't bring me trouble
But I won't say I won't understand
I won't say he'll love me forever
'Cause forever is a long, long time
But I will say he will never ever say
She was never time
Tomorrow could be forever away
Still I'd love him no less than I love him today
So tonight sleep will find me while it still can
Just clinging to my baby's hand
I won't say he won't ever stumble
But I'm clinging to my baby's hand
I won't say he won't bring me trouble
But I won't say I won't understand
I won't say he'll love me forever
'Cause forever is a long, long time
But I will say he will never ever say
She was never time
Tomorrow could be forever away
Still I'd love him no less than I love him today
So tonight sleep will find me while it still can
Just clinging to my baby's handShe was holding her breath and he attempted a prayer
And he was cussing the dust rising up in the air
'cause the old cattle trail, well, it weren't anywhere
For a baby to draw its first breath
And the unbroken West, well, it was no place to live
'cause it was hard to survive and it was Hell if you did
So he entered this world with a pair of clenched fists
And the first and last tears he'd shed
And the longhorns lowed him a welcome
As a new voice cried from the buckboard
And the Irish, they sang sad and lonely
'cause they knew a cowboy was born
Well, the Berry closed in and a century passed
The settlers plowed under the tall prairie grass
And the cow town's died off in a world changing fast
But the wind kept the spirit alive
'cause a young boy in Kansas, he caught a breeze one day
And in a five-second rush, he was fighting for eight
He saw it all so clear through the dirt on his face
He knew he was born to ride
And the long lost heir to the saddle finally found his way back home
As he picked up his hat, well, the crowd cheered
'cause they knew a cowboy was born
Yeah, that day a cowboy was born
From the heroes in the bright lights of Vegas
Through the poets of the sage and thorn
A proud legacy of a nation, thank God, the cowboy was born
Yeah, thank God, the cowboy was bornNow I've never stepped through the doors of a barroom or tasted the flavor of wine
And I've never danced to the songs on a jukebox or held someone that wasn't mine
But there's always the first time and if you don't change
Then I guess the first time can't be arranged can't be arranged
[ banjo ]
Now I've never dressed for the eyes of the stranger to sow seeds of lust in his mind
And I've never walked down backroad of temptation to leave dirty footprints behind
But there's always the first time...So this is how it ends
This is where it all goes down
This is what "I don't love you" feels like
It ain't the middle of the night
And it ain't even raining outside
It ain't exactly what I had in mind
For goodbye
At a red light
In the sunshine, on a Sunday
Nothin' to say, don't even try
Some are comin' home
Some are leavin' town
While my world's crashin' down on a Sunday
In the sunshine
At a red light
I thought she was gonna say
Somethin' about that couple kissin' crossin' the street
Or somethin' about this beautiful day
But she just looked me in the eye
Said it's over
Didn't try to lie
Or pick a fight
I might have seen it comin' thata way
But at a red light
In the sunshine, on a Sunday
Nothin' to say, don't even try
Some are comin' home
Some are leavin' town
While my world's crashin' down on a Sunday
In the sunshine
At a red light
There's a momma calmin' down a little baby in the backseat
in front of me
There's an old man dressed in his Sunday best just waitin' on green
But I can't see,
gettin' past
This red light
In the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothin' to say, don't even try
Some are comin' home
Some are leavin' town
While my world's crashin' down on a Sunday
in the sunshine (at a red light)
At a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothin' to say, don't even try
Some are comin' home
Some are leavin' town
While my world's crashin' down
On a Sunday
In the sunshine
At a red light
At a red light
At a red light
At a red light(Dolly Parton)
Without a love to call my own my life was incomplete
It seems I couldn't help but think that love was not for me
But my life took on a different twist when I met me a man that I couldn't resist
I didn't know what all I'd missed, and I'm a gettin' happy
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy
Yeah, I'm a gettin' happy - all my lonely days are gone
I'm a gettin' happy - no more lonely nights alone
I got someone to call my own and now my life is like a song
And he helps me sing along - I'm a gettin' happy
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy
Oh, people used to talk of love and I couldn't understand
About the fire and the desire in lovin' a good man
Oh, but now I know just what they meant since I met me a man that was Heaven sent
Wonder where the sadness went, cause I'm a gettin' happy
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy
I'm a gettin' happy - all my lonely days are gone
I'm a gettin' happy - no more lonely nights alone
I got someone to call my own and now my life is like a song
And he helps me sing along - an' I'm a gettin' happy
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy - whoo!
Yeah, I'm gettin' happy - all my lonely days are gone
I'm a gettin' happy - no more lonely nights alone
I got someone to call my own, now my life is like a song
Got someone to sing along and I'm a gettin' happy
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy
Hey, hey I'm a gettin' happy - all my lonely days are gone
I'm a gettin' happy - no more lonely nights alone
'Cause I'm a gettin' happyI often sing, for those I love
Who go to live, with Christ above
No more on earth, their forms I'll see
When I am gone, who'll sing for me
Who'll sing for me, when I am gone
And it won't be long, 'til (when) I'll see
When I am gone, who'll sing for me
'Til I too, must say goodbye
Just over there, with Christ I'll be
Get all my friends, to sing for me
Who'll sing for me, when I am gone
As I so oft, for friends have done
And it won't be long, 'til (when) I'll see
When I am gone, who'll sing for meJust outside there waiting.
Just outside the circle.
Waiting for that finger to point your way.
Just keep running. Just keep running.
New ones quickly burning.
Old ones die away.
Fires lit to say goodbye or hello.
Which way you looking? Which way you looking?
Count all wounds that brought you here.
Lay your blessings end to end.
Rid yourself of all regrets
Because here is where it all begins.
A bumbler's game, a cheaters wheel
Where the winner pays the highest cost.
You've laid your marker now watch the ball.
Hold your breath its about to fall.
Just outside there waiting.
Just outside the circle.
Waiting there is someone i don't know who.
I'm so open, i'm so open.
I don't sleep most nights,
Just lie awake and count my blessings.
I'll take this endless life
Of perfect pointless mornings.
I'll hold you till the morning comes
'Cause it's all that i can do.
I'm so open. I'm so open.
I don't like these last goodbyes.
I don't like goodbyes.On the front page of the paper
Speeding window of a train
On a billboard on a highway
It always looks the same
A smile out of nowhere,
Stops me in my tracks
Can't believe that after all this time
You still have that kind of impact
Everywhere I turn I see your face
Proving that a fool's love never fades
In my mind your image is forever burned
I keep trying not to stare but your always there
Everywhere I turn
In a steamed up cafe window
I spell out your name
I watch people run across the street
Through the pouring rain
There you are again so easy to find
Under the umbrella in another woman's eyes
Well I thought I'd suffered long enough for you babe
And my mind would let go of the pain, any day
But it don't work that way....The sunlight on my shoulders
The smile on my face
My secret weapon, my favorite place
The reason my heart skips a beat
The broom that sweeps me off my feet
A gentle inspiration
My weary soul's salvation
The half that makes me whole
The gravity that grounds me
The arms I want around me
Never letting go
I've lived
I've lived enough
To know what is
And what's not
You are-you are
All the love I want to make
Every breath I want to take
The rush that's running down my spine
The touch that takes me every time
An innocent seduction
Oh I can't get enough and
I can't help but let it show
I lose all my composure
I'm totally exposed and
The reason I let go
Is
I've lived
I've lived enough
I know what is
And what's not
You are-you are
My every hope
My every dream
You are my everything
I've lived yeah
I've lived enough
I know what is
And what's not
You are-you are-you are
The sunlight on my shoulders
The smile on my face
My secret weapon
My favorite placeIf I could write a letter to me
And send it back in time to myself at seventeen
First I'd prove it's me by saying
Look under your bed, there's a Skoal can and a Playboy
No one else would know you hid
And then I'd say I know it's tough
When you break up after seven months
And yeah I know you really liked her
And it just don't seem fair
But I'll I can say is pain like that is fast and it's rare
And oh, you got so much going for you
Going right
But I know at seventeen
It's hard to see past Friday night
She wasn't right for you
But still you feel like there's
A knife sticking out of your back
And you wondering if you'll survive
But you'll make it through this and you'll see
You're still around to write this letter to me
At the stop sign at Tomlinson and 8th
Always stop completely, don't just tap your brakes
And when you get a date with Bridget
Make sure the tank is full
On second thought forget it, that one turns out kinda cool
Each and every time you have a fight
Just assume you're wrong and Dad is right
And you should really thank Ms. Brinkman
She spent so much extra time
It like she sees the diamond underneath
And she's polishing you till you shine
And oh you got so much going for you
Going right
But I know at seventeen
It's hard to see past Friday night
Tonight's the bonfire rally
But you're staying home instead
Because if you fail Algebra
Mom and Dad will kill you dead
Trust me you'll squeak by and get a C
And you're still around to write this letter to me
You got so much up ahead
You'll make new friends
You should see your kids and wife
And I'd end by saying have no fear
These are nowhere near
The best years of your life
I guess I'll see you in the mirror
When you're a grown man
P.S. go hug Aunt Rita every chance you can
And oh you got so much going for you
Going right
But I know at seventeen
It's hard to see past Friday night
I wish you'd study Spanish
I wish you'd take a typing class
I wish you wouldn't worry, let it be
I'd say have a little faith and you'll see
If I could write a letter to me
To meFly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On a, Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, in other words
I love you.In another time and place
Grandma would kiss my face
Wish I could go back there again
I'd climb up in my grandpa's lap
I'd lay down and take a nap
That old man and me were best friends
And one day I turned around
Leaves are fallin', fallin' down
Those fields were bare and brown and they were gone
Long gone like bluebonnets in the spring
We're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet
So make the most of every mile
So pack light and love heavy
Give it all your heart and soul, so in the end
You won't regret one thing
Life is like bluebonnets in the spring.
There's so much I can't explain
Such as gravity and pain
Still I remain, blindfolded and full of faith
I kissed my angel girl goodbye
Still can't help but wonder why
But I believe I'll see her again someday
So, hold 'em tender, hold 'em tight
Pray every mornin', day, and night
That God will help you raise them right
And don't you blink, don't blink
'Cause like bluebonnets in the spring
We're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet
So make the most of every mile
So pack light and love heavy
Give it all your heart and soul
So in the end you won't regret one thing
Life is like bluebonnets in the spring
Life can be filled full of sorrow
Time is something you can't borrow
So love like there's no tomorrow
Because today could the day
Like bluebonnets in the spring
We're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet
So make the most of every mile
So pack light and love heavy
Give it all your heart and soul, so in the end
You won't regret one thing
Life is like bluebonnets in the spring
Life is like bluebonnets in the springThe walls that surround me in this room I call my well of loneliness
Keep whispering your name with the voices hauntin' as your soft arrays
And since you've gone away I get lonelier each day
And I still don't know how you can put me through it
If there's any love still burning in your heart you'd be returnin'
If you loved me you'd do it
If you love me you'd do it you'd come back home to me
You'd take away this loneliness and end my misery
If you love me yes if you'd love me you'd do it
The memories that I live with seem to press against me softly in the night
Remembering the good times don't leave time to think of who was wrong or right
Love is not an easy prize it can pay before your eyes
It's not a simple thing and we both knew it
And to throw it all away is wrong so come back home if you'd love me you'd do it
If you love me you'd do it...I think about you
When I don't want to
Dream about your smiling face
I keep trying not to love you
But I love you anyway
We should be together, together
We should be walking side by side
We should be together, together
Keeping each other satisfied
I have thought to come to know you
I've come to need your company
What will I do if I can't have you
If I can't have you
What will I do
We should be together, together
We should be walking side by side
We should be together, together
Keeping each other satisfiedWell I feel better all over more than anywhere else baby when I'm out with you
Well I feel better all over more than anywhere else when you kiss me like you do
Well am as wild as a buck everytime you cause me up
You sure make me feel like a wheel
Well I feel better all over more than anywhere else that's exactly how I feel
[ steel - fiddle ]
Oh I feel better all over more than anywhere else
When you whisper sweet nothings in my ear
Oh I feel better all over more than anywhere else honey anytime that you're near
Well my heart beats double time when you hold your hand in mine
You sure is a wonderful deal
Well I feel better all over more than anywhere else that's exactly how I feel
Oh that's exactly how I feelNO LETTER TODAY
WRITER FRANKIE BROWN aka TED DAFFAN
'59 Peer International, BMI
No letter today I've waited since dawn I've waited each day since you have been gone
No letter today all the days are so long oh why don't you write I know I was wrong
Just give me one chance please won't you forgive I'll love you my dear as long as I live
I know it's no use though I hope and I pray the postman goes by no letter today
Just give me one chance please won't you forgive I'll love you my dear as long as I live
I know it's no use though I hope and I pray the postman goes by no letter todayIf we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town
Come summer time
Maybe even California
If we make it through December
We'll be fine
Got laid off down at the factory
And their timing's not the greatest
In the world
Heaven knows I've been working hard
Wanted Christmas to be right
For daddy's girl
I don't mean to hate December
It's meant to be the happy time of year
And my little girl don't understand
Why daddy can't afford no Christmas hereShe growls in barroom German
As the smoke hangs from her lips
She could attact her own Gestapo
With the way she moves her Hips
No complaints about her service,
Cuz she's good and she'd get rich
If these cheap, young, broke and trust fund ex-pat kids would learn to tip
There ain't no better place to find you if you got yourself to lose, and all she wants is to get down with the Alt Berliner Blues
Well she can still remember when they first went off the mark. The windows all got shuttered and theaters went dark
She won the whole town over with her renaissance burlesque. Pelts of wolf and coyote, bear claw necklace on her chest
There ain't no better place to find you if you got yourself to lose, and all she wants is to get down with the Alt Berliner Blues
Well stumble over tourists at the remnants of the wall
Hung over from the Schapps and funky Prussian alcohol
Well it kind of feels like lots of US voices in the crowd
And the singers drowned in reverb and the drum machine's too loud
You won't find no better place across the whole of the EU
If all you want is to get down with the Alt Berliner Blues
Herr Guild I hope you're happy with yourself and all your Freund, may your throat be parched and .... and your hunger disappoint ya
A century of thirst outlasting two or three world wars and 100 year old beer halls that do not exist no more.
There ain't nothing left but ghosts of many lifetimes worth of booze. Ain't nothing gonna get you gone like the Alt Berliner Blues.Wanna find some boy, rip his heart right out
First man I see, gonna take him down
It ain't the Christian thing to do, they say
But someone, somewhere's gotta pay
And if it wasn't for guys like you, there wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong, I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah, even I'm surprised how easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it wasn't for guys like you, there wouldn't be songs like this
Broke my TV, pawned my guitar
After maxing out my credit cards
You lied much to much, and you lied again
Caught you on the couch with my best friend
And if it wasn't for guys like you, there wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong, I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah, even I'm surprised how easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it wasn't for guys like you, there wouldn't be songs like this one
That tell the whole world just what a jerk you are
And if it wasn't for guys like you, there wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong, I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah, even I'm surprised how easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it wasn't for guys like you, there wouldn't be songs like this
No, if it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like thisThe word is faithful, look it up
It don't mean sneakin' around
Behind my back like you ain't gettin' enough
How 'bout forever,
Just look it up
It means through thick and thin
And pitchin' in even when the times get tough
The word is easy, look it up
And you'll see a picture of that piece of trash
Ridin' 'round in your pickup truck
Let's try liar,
Just look it up
But you'll need boots to wade through all the bull
You tell me when you come home drunk
It's just like you to be so clueless
'Cause you never thought I'd do this
I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone
The word is over
Look it up
You said you're sober, look it up
It's right next to hell is freezin' over,
Flyin' pigs, and all that stuff
And how bout baby, look it up
It's what you call me and it's how you act
Every time I call your bluff
It's just like you to keep denyin'
Save your whinin' and your cryin'
I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone
The word is over
Look it up
The word's forgiveness, look it up
It's what Jesus has in store for you
But I don't no matter what
Quit your beggin' and your prayin'
Can't you hear what I've been sayin'?
I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone
The word is over
Look it up
Asshole
Just look it up, look it upMay the fruit of my toil be yours love and may the food from my soil be yours love
And from this moment on may a love that is strong and lives on and on be yours love
May the sons that I raise be yours love may the comforts I praise be yours love
And if I ever get weak may the love words I speak
And the arms that I seek be yours love
May the Lord's shining grace be yours love may the happiest face be yours love
And from this moment on may a love true and strong and lives on and on be yours love
May the Lord's shining grace be yours love may the happiest face be yours love
And may the last fingertips that touch these two lips
As life from me slips be yours loveDo do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do
Bicycles are made for rain
One hand on handlebars
One on my umbrella
My ankles are getting wet
But I can't help but steer
For the deepest puddle
Let the rain fall
Soak us to the bone
Nothing will sink our smiles
Double dutch was made for sunny days
When we've been driving such long hours
Our legs get restless so we need to jump and run
and laugh with one another
And if there is no sun
When we're far from home
Nothing will sink our smiles
Let the rain fall
Soak us to the bone
Nothing will sink our smiles
Life can be uncertain at the best of times
Try to move quicker by the worst of times
All things are made better when you have some friends
to get by with a little help
Bathing suits are made for sandy beaches
Where the waters warm in the afternoon
I can do no dolphin kick but I can spin in circles
Float till the rise of the moon
Let the waves roll
Wash us to the shore
Nothing can sink our smiles
And if there is no sun
When we're far from home
Nothing will sink our smiles
Let the rain fall
Soak us to the bone
Nothing will sink our smiles
Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Ba ba ba ba ba
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh ooohCome all ye fair and tender ladies take warning how you court young men
They're like a star on a summer morning they first appear and then they're gone
They'll tell to you some loving story and make you think they love you so well
Away they'll go and court some other and leave you there in grief to dwell
Oh love is handsome love is charming and love is pretty while it's new
But love grows cold as love goes old and fades away like morning dew
And fades away like morning dewHer house on the corner of Cedar and Elm
Still stands in our town
But it's been empty since she moved away
The day that the saw mill closed down
We'd sit on her porch almost every night
I remember how happy we were
We'd grow up and marry
I'd work at the mill to make a living for her
Her father worked at the mill
Like most of the others in town
I lost my girl when he lost his job
The day that the saw mill closed down
She moved from the corner of Cedar and Elm
And I never saw her again
But I can still hear her mother's soft voice
Saying, Honey it's time to come in
No longer do mill hands live here
The giant saws don't make a sound
No longer does my love live here
Not since the saw mill closed down
She left when the saw mill closed downA long time forgotten
Are dreams that just fell by the way.
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's living today.
But she never complains
Of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord.
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come.
She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.
He likes the night life,
The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.
When the party's all over,
She'll welcome him back home again.
Lord knows she don't understand him,
But she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a good-hearted woman;
She loves her good-timin' man.
She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.The older you get, the more you stand to lose
You can bet that we'll all have our turn
If I lost everything right down to my shoes
As long as you love me, I won't be concerned
[Chorus:]
There's one thing in life that I can't replace
It's written in ways even time can't erase
Some things really are too good to be true
That something in my life is you
Now I've spent my time on money and things
That won't do a heart any good
With nothing to gain but the space that it brings
Which had always been empty till I understood
[Chorus]
One thing's for certain and without a doubt
Your love is something I can't live without
Some things really are too good to be true
That something in my life, one thing in my life
That something in my life is youDon't you waste anytime with those bags under your eyes
Put you bag in your hand and run with me
Just to know you're this close
Darlin' I nearly choke
Can't you see you can have all my tomorrows
Come on Miss K wrap your lovin' arms around me
Talk dirty, turn me on, let's get goin'
Well we're young and we're brave
So turn your back and walk away
Turn your back to the past and take off fast
Just to dance in your arms it's like I can't fall apart
So take a chance change your stance and see what happens
Come on Miss K wrap your drunken arms around me
Talk dirty, turn me on, let's get goin'
Well our lives are ever changing
Some shit always hits the fan
Oh, but when we first locked eyes
Well Miss K you took me by surprise
Don't you waste anytime with those bags under your eyes
Put you bag in your hand and roll with me
Just to know you're this close
Darlin' I nearly choke
So can't you see you can have all my tomorrows
Come on Miss K wrap your lovin' arms around me
Talk dirty, turn me on, let's get goin'
Come on Miss K wrap your lovin' arms around me
Talk dirty, turn me on, let's get goin'
Let's get goin'
Get goin'
Goin'
Hey where we goin'
Let's just go
Keep movin' babyToday you upped and walked right out the door
Said you wasn't coming round this place no more
And you didn't have to say it's not an act
It's gonna take a whole lot of somethin' to bring you back
Well I've treated you the best that I knew how
But what have I got to show for all that now
I've got a broken heart and that's somethin' you seem to lack
It's gonna take a whole lot of somethin' to bring you back
Well it seems a shame to me you'd leave this way
And I never thought I'd ever see the day
I gotta change my ways I see and that's a fact
It's gonna take a whole lot of somethin' to bring you back
Well I've treated you...
It's gonna take a whole lot of somethin' to bring you backOh carry me back to the lone prairie
Where the coyotes howl and the wind blows free
And when I die you can bury me
Neath the western skies on the lone prairie
I'm a roving cowboy far away from home
Far from the prairie where I used to roam
Where the doggies wander and the wind blows free
Thought my heart is yonder on the lone prairie
Oh carry me back to the lone prairie...Take your suitcase and take your heart
Take a train to the boulevard
My love will follow you, my love will follow you
You can try to lose yourself downtown
You can burn all your bridges down
My love will follow you,
Yeah, my love will follow you
[Chorus]
My love will follow you
Down every highway or your soul
You can leave me far behind
But my love will be your shadow
Everywhere you go
So close to the door, turn in the key
Leave me here like a memory
My love will follow you, my love will follow you
Even on a road that takes you down where
Cords of human kindness come unwound
My love will follow you,
Yeah, my love will follow you
[Chorus]
If you should go so far, that you cannot get back
Girl, you may not remember,
But my heart will not lose track
So go ahead and take that train
In my heart you'll still remain
My love will follow you, my love will follow you
My love will follow you
Oh, follow you
My love will follow youDon't tell me your troubles
I got troubles of my own
Don't tell me your troubles
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Go on home
Tell it to a friend
I got troubles of my own
You say your sweet love left you
And what to think about me
I got them same old heartaches
And the same old misery
[Chorus]
Leave me alone
Go on home
Tell it to a friend
I got troubles of my own
Troubles of my own
It happens to the best of us
And that's what they always say
To take it bowin' like a man
They don't stand in my way
You tell me that's she's a no good
She's as mean as she can be
It's written all over your lonesome face
And any heartbreak fool can see
[Chorus]
It happens to the best of us
And that's what they always say
To take it bowin' like a man
They don't stand in my way
You tell me that's she's a no good
She's as mean as she can be
It's written all over your lonesome face
And any heartbreak fool can see
[Chorus]I told this heart of mine our love would never be,
But then I hear your voice and something stirs inside of me,
Somehow I can't dismiss the mem'ry of your kiss,
Guess my heart has a mind of its own.
No matter what I do,
No matter what I say, mo matter how I try,
I just can't turn the other way,
When I'm with someone new, I always think of you;
Guess my heart has a mind of its own.
You're not in love with me,so why can't I forget,
I'm just your used to be?
It's wrong and yet,
I know forgetting you would be a hopeless thing to do,
For I'm a puppet, and I just can't seem to break the string,
I say I'll let you go, but then my heart says no,
Guess my heart has a mind of its own.
I told this heart of mine our love would never be,
But then I hear your voice and something stirs inside of me,
Somehow I can't dismiss the mem'ry of your kiss,
Guess my heart has a mind of its own.
No matter what I do,
No matter what I say, mo matter how I try,
I just can't turn the other way,
When I'm with someone new, I always think of you;
Guess my heart has a mind of its own.
You're not in love with me,so why can't I forget,
I'm just your used to be?
It's wrong and yet,
I know forgetting you would be a hopeless thing to do,
For I'm a puppet, and I just can't seem to break the string,
I say I'll let you go, but then my heart says no,
Guess my heart has a mind of its own.(Walt Meskell, Tim Martin)
Just another Texas bus stop
Texas never seems to end
On my seventh cup a' coffee
Waitress, hit me once again
Gotta date in Colorado
With the woman in my life
I've seen enough of fairgrounds
An' singin' in the lights
'Cause the only light I wanna see
Is the light that's in the eyes
Of the woman waitin' up for me again
Yeah, the only light I wanna see
Is a candle in the winda
An' the open door that she'll be standin' in
Driver says, "It's time, folks"
So we straggle back on board
Just me, a nun, two cowboys
An' a guy in back that snored
Been twenty-seven hours
Full a' anything but fun
An' over my right shoulder
There's an early-mornin' sun
But the only light I wanna see
Is the light that's in the eyes
Of a woman waitin' up for me again
Yeah, the only light I wanna see
Is a candle in the winda
An' the open door that she'll be standin' in
Goin' on forty hours
An' I've been too long alone
But it's only just a walk, now
Up the hill and then I'm home
I've seen too many bus stops
An' I've sung my share a' songs
But the spotlight only matters
When it's shinin' in my home
'Cause the only light I wanna see
Is a light that's in the eyes
Of a woman waitin' up for me again
Yeah, the only light I wanna see
Is a candle in the winda
An' the open door that she'll be standin' in
[Fade out]
Yeah, the only light I wanna see
Is the light that's in the eyes
Of a woman waitin' up for me again
Yeah, the only light I wanna see
Is a candle in the winda
An' the open door that she'll be standin' in
'Cause the only light I wanna see
Is the light that's in the eyes
Of the woman waitin' up for me again
Yeah, the only light I wanna see...Here I am standing firm
As the ground shakes beneath me
I send you away with my own hand
I try and try to remember that for now it's for the better
But there's a Southern kind of tragic blowing in
Oh and it feels like the beginning of the end
Well the Alabama moon fell from the sky
And the sweet tea wells ran dry
Somewhere out there you're finding yourself
Back home it's the end of time
I'm scared to death, pick up your phone, outside
I hear the bells ringing
Bringing ruin to all that we have ever known
Pick up your phone, I need an answer
Come home and call off disaster
'Cause I fear tonight our Cotton Land might fall
Oh I'm cracking like the plaster on the wall
Oh the Alabama moon fell from the sky
And the sweet tea wells ran dry
Somewhere out there you're finding yourself
Back home it's the end of time
It's the end of time
Is it the end of all time
Or just the end of mine
Well all of the cotton it died in the fields
The little babies cried the blue from their eyes
Somewhere I'll bet you're living it up
So come home before the end
The Alabama moon, fell from the sky
And the sweet tea wells ran dry
Somewhere out there you're finding yourself
Back home it's the end of time
Come home come home and be mine
Come home and come homeLast night was the worst that I've gone through
Cause last night was the first without
I never felt so left alone
Called your house but you weren't home
Last night was the worst of my life
I've known your sweet love for so long
So last night I tried to think what went wrong
I counted stars tried to forget
It's no use you're not home yet
Yeah last night was the worst of my life
Maybe a new love I should find
But I can't with you still on my mind
They're telling me to forget you
Easy to say but hard to do
Last night was the worst of my lifeMarried you four years ago,
Now I'm a soldier's wife.
Knew one day, you'd have to go,
I miss you in my nights.
In seven weeks, our baby's due,
You're half-a-world away.
Know our country's needin' you,
But all I have to say is:
Baby, come back home,
I need you too.
Baby, come back home,
Honey, I love you.
Next door neighbour's son was there,
Fightin' the same war.
We just heard the news today:
He won't be home no more.
Freedom never has come free,
There's a price to pay.
Lord knows, I'm proud of you,
But I miss you more each day.
Baby, come back home,
I need you too.
Baby, come back home,
Honey, I love you.
Until you're back home, darlin',
And in my arms to stay,
I pray God watches over you,
Every minute you're away.
Baby, come back home,
I need you too.
Baby, come back home,
Honey, I love you.
Honey, I love you.(I sit here and look at you, lonely room it's sad for lovers change their ways
Just like me you miss the love we once knew she's left me in the world of blue
Lonely room of too many mem'ries lonely room reminds me that she's gone
Blue is my lonely room
[ guitar ]
Lonely room of too many mem'ries...
It's hard to believe that she's really gone I'm hoping and dreaming too
It seems such a shame that she's gone from me cause my love for her is still true
Lonely room of too many mem'ries...)Once I stood in the night with my head bowed low
In the darkness as black as could be
In my heart felt alone and I cried oh Lord don't hide your face from me
Hold my hand all the way every hour every day from here to the great unknown
Take my hand let me stand where no one stands alone
[ guitar ]
Like a king I may live in a palace so tall with great riches to call my own
But I don't know a thing in this whole wide world that's worse than being alone
Hold my hand all the way...There ain't no man that can save me
There ain't no man that can enslave me
Ain't no man or men that can change the shape my soul is in
There ain't nobody here
Who can cause me pain or raise my fear 'cause I got only love to share
If you're looking for truth I'm proof you'll find it there
You got to serve something, ain't that right
I know it gets dark but there's always a light
You're gonna have to buy in to get into the club
Trade your worries
You gotta show up if you wanna be seen
If you matters to you, ma, it matters to me
I'm gonna fall hard, yeah I know I am
When the clowns crack up I laugh with them
Ain't no man that can save me
There ain't no man that can enslave me
Ain't no man or men that can change the shape my soul is in
There ain't nobody here
Who can cause me pain or raise my fear 'cause I got only love to share
If you're looking for truth I'm proof you'll find it there
You say you look funny, I say you're a star
I say you're whatever you think you are
Watch your naysayers fall right in line
If we believe it they'll say she is so pretty
He is so fine
There ain't no man that can save me
There ain't no man that can enslave me
There ain't no man or men that can change the shape my soul is in
There ain't nobody here
Who can cause me pain or raise my fear 'cause I got only love to share
If you're looking for truth I'm proof you'll find it there
You got to go somewhere, ain't that true
Not a whole lot of time for me or you
Got a whole lot of reasons to be mad, let's not pick one
I live in a room at the top of the stairs
Got my windows wide open and nobody cares
And I got no choice but to get right up when the sun comes through
Ain't no man that can save me
There ain't no man that can enslave me
There ain't no man or men that can change the shape my soul is in
There ain't nobody here
Who can cause me pain or raise my fear 'cause I got only love to share
If you're looking for truth I'm proof you'll find it there
If you're looking for truth I'm proof you'll find it there
If you're looking for truth I'm proof you'll find itToday I took some paper from the closet
And wrapped the wedding ring
You left behind
And I addressed it to the man
Who vowed to love you
And on the little card
I wrote these words inside
[Chorus]
Merry Christmas to me
Just one gift beneath my tree
For the fool who let you leave
Merry Christmas to me
Then I sat down in my chair
And thought about you
About the many reasons why you're gone
And I opened up the present that I gave me
And realized how much it hurts to be alone
[Chorus]When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them ol' cotton fields back home
It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them ol' cotton fields back home
When them cotton bolls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them ol' cotton fields back home
It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them ol' cotton fields back homeWhen my baby holds me I feel so good
I'll never leave her yet I know I should
Though she does wrong I can't say goodbye
Someday these blues will kill me but what a way to die
Tonight I know if I let her go
Just how lonely life would be for me
But I'll let her hurt me let her make me cry
Come on blues and take me what a way to dieWrapping paper everywhere
Stacked up dishes, but who cares
They can wait until tomorrow now
It's you and me, and this old couch
The Christmas tree in our living room
Fills the room with pine perfume
And colored lights dancing on the walls
While Nat King Cole sings "Deck The Halls"
Don't you get the sense tonight
That for now the world is right
And as another Christmas ends
My mind drifts and once again
I'm thinking like a six year old
Only 364 days to go
Max got his bike
I swear, that kid
He's got it parked right by his bed
Jenny sure loves her puppy too
I'm not sure just who walked who
Thanks for my robe, no that's ok
It looks better on you anyway
What is it about this time of year
That makes our troubles disappear
'Cause don't you get the sense tonight
That for now the world is right
And as another Christmas ends
My mind drifts and once again
I'm thinking like a six year old
Only 364 days to go
We can't avoid it
No way around it
Before too long we'll be
Either back to work back to school
Or just back to reality
Don't you get the sense tonight
That for now the world is right
And as another Christmas ends
My mind drifts and once again
I'm thinking like a six year old
Only 364 days to go
Be here before you know itYou are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I hung my head and I cried.
I'll always love you and make you happy,
If you will only say the same.
But if you leave me to love another,
You'll regret it all some day
You told me once, dear, you really loved me
And no one else could come between.
But not you've left me and love another;
You have shattered all my dreamsIf you're weary from climbin' mountains and you've been troubled with heavy rain
If you're drinkin' from a fountain that never cleanses your thirsty dream
Then come along and walk with me let's find a keeper of heaven's keys
And when we find him he'll set us free oh come along and walk with me
For every question and every wonder oh there's an answer that satisfies
When your wisdom grows weak from hunger
That's when your soul needs a bread of life
Oh come along and walk with me
All you sisters and all you brothers if we're the children of Abraham
Then let us prove it by telling others about the shepherd who loves his lamb
And come along and walk with me
Oh come along and walk with meIt's you that
I run to
Whenever I need to
Darling, you console me
When trouble surrounds me
When bad times have found me
Just reach out your arms and hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Darling please take me
In your arms of safety
Reach out your arms
And hold me
Hold me
When my feelings are showing
When my tears are flowing
Just reach out
Reach out and hold me
Hold me
Hold me
You know all of my needs
You fill them completely
You know
That you control me
I depend on
Your lovin'
Without you
I'm nothin'
So reach out
Your arms and hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Darling please take me
In your arms of safety
Reach out you arms
And hold me
Hold me
When life is demanding
When I need understanding
Reach out
Reach out and hold me
Hold me
Hold meWhat your leaving's done to me time will never heal
My life just ain't the same all my dreams aren't real
Tearstains on my pillow I'm blue as can be oh that's what your leaving's done to me
I stare at the wall like a fool I guess I am
To be in love with someone who's not around
The moon don't shine the clouds are all I see
Oh that's what your leaving's done to me
They say I'm going crazy well I guess I am
I don't know what to do so I just walk around
The skies that once were blue now they're grey as can be
Oh that's what your leaving's done to me
[ steel ]
They say I'm going crazy...
Oh that's what your leaving's done to meRight there in the living room is our little lit-up tree
We haven't even started wrapping hardly anything
There's only one thing I need, yeah and you can bet
Me being wrapped up with you is the best present I could get
It's cold outside, you and I gotta go no where
I could start a fire lay beside you all night right here
The snow's comin' down and it won't be the only thing falling
So let's stay here together under the weather
Under the weather, under the weather
Carols comin' through the radio
People saying stay off the roads
Kissin' you under the mistletoe
That's a reason to stay at home
Baby it's cold outside, you and I gotta go no where
I could start a fire lay beside you all night right here
The snow's comin' down and it won't be the only thing falling
So let's stay here together under the weather
I waited for this all year long
Something about turning on
Christmas lights for the first time
Watchin' them shine in your eyes
Baby it's cold outside, you and I gotta go no where
I could start a fire lay beside you all night right here
The snow's comin' down and it won't be the only thing falling
So let's stay here together under the weather
Yeah under the weather, under the weatherOh the river of death lies just before me
Can I find a place that I can cross
Or will I be in sin forever
Oh Lord don't let my soul be lost
Oh I wanna walk with Christ my savior
For he's the one that'll guide me on
All through my life I've been a sinner
Now I'm right with God so I'm travelling home
Oh I can hear my savior calling
To me his voice sounds sweet and low
For me I hear my loved ones cheering
Oh, praise the Lord I'm ready to go
My life down here will soon be over
And this old world holds nothing for me
He saved my soul and He made me happy
That beautiful land I'm going to seeWinter Summer seasons is taken over it`s quiet
Like new fallen snow
I told you summer stories but outside is getting mighty cold
I told you everything I could about me
Told you everything I could
How would you feel if the world was falling apart around you
Pieces of the sky were falling in your neighbors yard
But not on you
Wouldn't you feel just a little bit funny
Think maybe there`s something you oughta do
Solutions that never lay down before you the answers are all around
Believing is all the friend you need to talk to
Believing in you
I told you everything I could about me
Told you everything I could
I told you everything I could about me
Told you everything I couldI see so many people
As I walk these cities and these towns
Some souls truly shining
Some worn down to the ground
And I see people chasing dreams
Some chasing dollars 'til they drown
Seems the more they have
Then the more they need
And the more they'll fight to hold it down
Staring at the sun, staring at the sun
We're staring at the sun
So I read the papers, watched the tv
For the heroes we all fall about
Most like children on a playground
Only noticed by how loud they scream and shout
But how we love our heroes
Almost as much as we like to tear them down
For they are all that we are not
And we are not to be let down
Staring at the sun, staring at the sun
We're staring at the sun
And do you see the storm that's coming?
Do you think that it's too late?
Are you blinded by your love?
Or by your ignorance and hate?
And do you think you're the only one?
The only one who's ever felt the call of fate?
And felt your life had just begun?
While you were staring at the sun
And as a child, I heard Martin Luther
Call to the people "Now let freedom ring!"
But they shot him down
For the change his love would bring
And so I asked myself, so I asked myself
Who would do these hateful things?
And in the end I found, in the end I found
That they are you and me
And do you see the storm that's coming?
Do you think that it's too late?
Are you blinded by your love?
Or by your ignorance and hate?
And do you think you're the only one?
The only one who's ever thought to hesistate?
And felt your life had come undone?
While you were staring at the sun
Staring at the sun, staring at the sun
We're staring at the sunI go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the starlight
Just like we used to do
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searching for you
I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that's just my way
Of sayin' I love you
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for you
I stop to see a weeping willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm as lonesome as I can be
I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the moonlight
Just a-hopin you may be
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for me
I stop to see a weeping willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm as lonesome as I can be
I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the moonlight
Just a-hopin you may be
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for me
I go out walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for youI don't wanna cry this early this mornin'
But cry I will if you go through with me, with me alone
I don't wanna cry this early this mornin'
So lay back down and love me and leave the leavin' till later on
I don't wanna think about tomorrow
Lord knows, I got my hands full just worryin' about today
If it's true that God sees every sparrow when it falls
I hope He'll see me fallin' if you up and walk away
'Cause I don't wanna cry this early this mornin'
But cry I will if you go through with me, with me alone
I don't wanna cry this early this mornin'
So lay back down and love me and leave the leavin' till later on
So lay back down and love me and leave the leavin' till later on
I don't wanna cryI found it in a pawn shop in a ragged cardboard case
With the guns and dusty watches it looked so out of place
With a Trailways baggage sticker yellow frayed and torn
Destination Nashville Septemper '64
[Chorus]
And you could tell by the fingerboard her painted nails were long
She only needed three cords to play those good ole country songs
And her name's etched in the finish like a fading battle scar
And this 1950 Gibson was Emma Jean's guitar
I wonder if she played it in a small town talent show
With her hair teased to perfection in a dress her mama sewed
And for a little inspiration she pasted on a star
Here up on the head stock of Emma Jean's guitar
[Chorus]
Doooooo doooo
I wouldn't even know her if I saw her face to face
But there's a little bit of Emma Jean in every song I play
She passed along these hopes and dreams cradled in my arms
And I am just a guardian of Emma Jean's guitar
[Chorus]
This 1950 Gibson was Emma Jean's guitar
Doooo dooo doooo doo oooooooYeah, I think I'm gonna leave
I just had that one drink
And we've all gotta be up early
Boys, we oughta shut her down
Just take it to the house
Before anybody starts getting crazy
So I started walking across the floor
Before I got to the door
Aw naw, somebody just bought a
Shot of Patron, hang on
I just might have to stay
Aw naw, look at the time y'all
What happened to coats on, long gone...
I should be halfway home but aw naw
Yeah, girl I saw you come in
With all of your girlfriends
Just cuttin' up and shooting Bacardi
Yeah, I got my boys with me
But we're just blowin' off steam
Not lookin' to pick up anybody
So I was gonna walk on by
You turned around and we locked eyes
Aw naw, did you hear that song,
Oh the one that just came on
Come on, DJ, what you trying to do?
Aw naw, it would be so wrong
If we didn't dance one
Show off those jeans you painted on, aw naw, aw naw
No, I didn't mean to be here this long
I tried to leave so it ain't my fault.
No I didn't mean to be holding you
But tell me what was I supposed to do?
Aw naw, somebody just bought a
Shot of that Patron, hang on
We've been here all night long
Aw naw, it would be so wrong
If we didn't dance one more song
Show off those jeans you painted on, aw naw
Yeah, aw naw
Those jeans you painted on, aw nawTHERE ARE SOME THINGS
(Bill Anderson - Red Hayes)
'68 Stallion Music
RECORDED BY CONNIE SMITH
You can't see a mem'ry of love that's untrue
Hear a tear fall or a heart break in two
You can't draw on paper the picture of pain
There are some things you just can't explain
You can't see where love disappears when it dies
A heart sheds no tears still you know that it cries
You can't see how empty a soul is inside
There are some things words just won't describe
You can't see the future though you've known the past
Or know how long a love hurt will last
Blue mem'ries burn though you don't see the flame
There are some things you just can't explain
You can't see where love disappears...
There are some things you just can't explainI can hear the whistle blowin' I am lonesome as can be
Tonight the rain is saftly fallin' and it's fallin' just for me
Looking back along the road I travel the miles could tell a million tales
Each year is like some rolling freight train cold as starlight on the rails
[ harmonica ]
A man who lives out on the highway he's like a flock that can't tell time
A man who spends his life just rambling is like a song without a rhyme
I think about my home and family my house and all the things that mean
The black smoke trailin' out behind me is like a string of broken dreams
Looking back along....i don't wanna ask too much
be too bold
i dont wanna weigh you down
with a heavy load
ive heard you say that you can handle anything
but what i really need to know is
would you wait for me
when i gotta leave
could i ever be everything you need
if i promise you my love
could that promise be enough
oh would you wait for me
would you wait for me
i dont need a magic night
too make me feel
like im living in a fairytale
i know this love is real
and hear me when i say
that when ever im away
my heart is with you
all the same
but would you wait for me
when i gotta leave
could i ever be everything you need
and if i promise you my love
could that promise be enough
oh would you wait for me
would you wait for me
and looking back at where weve been
me being scared to let you in
to you becoming my best friend
no matter where i travel to
im coming right back home to you
if you'll just wait for me
would you wait for me
when i gotta leave
could i ever be everything you need
if i promise you my love
could that promise be enough
would you wait for me
yeah would you wait for me
when i gotta leave
could i ever be everything you need
if i promise you my love
could that promise be enough
would you wait for me
would you wait for me
would you wait for meWhen you reach that golden city (golden city)
Friends and loved ones you shall see (you shall see)
When the saints come out to meet you (out to meet you)
Oh shake my mother's hand for me
Shake my mothers hand and tell her (and then tell her)
Happy may her spirits be (your spirits be)
When the saints come out to meet you (out to meet you)
Oh shake my mother's hand for me
There are times I often wonder
How can all these trials be
Time can't keep me here much longer
Oh shake my mother's hand for me
Over there you'll meet my Savior
Many loved ones you will see
When you've had a talk with Jesus
Oh shake my mother's hand for meCat Diesel Power cap pulled down low
Makin that bacon, row by row
Can't get them muscles at the YMCA
It's from choppin' cotton, cuttin' corn and slingin' that hay
Been heavy liftin' since the crack of dawn
No doubt about it that boy's country strong
He's up in the mornin' yawnin' with those work boots on
Workin' like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home
Blue collar in his blood, backwoods in his bones
No doubt about it that boy's country strong
He wears an old felt hat on his head
Got a saddle for a pillow, and the ground for a bed
Spurs on his heels, reins in his hands
Drivin' cattle, ropin' steers and burnin' his brand
There ain't no lettin' up all day long
No doubt about it that boy's country strong
He's up in the mornin' yawnin' with those work boots on
Workin' like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home
Blue collar in his blood, backwoods in his bones
No doubt about it that boy's country strong
Yea behind every good man, there's a woman
She's the one thing that keeps him goin', keeps him goin'
She's up in the mornin' yawnin' with that coffee pot on
Workin' like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home
Blue collar in her blood, backwoods in her bones
No doubt about it that girl's country strong
Cowboy's, plowboys, good hearted women
They're all country strong(Chip Davis, Bill Fries)
She was old, and beautiful, and wise, and She taught the young boy everything he needed to know. All about the land, and the woods and the rivers, and what had happened there even before he was born. She taught him what was good and what was bad. And most of all, the difference between right and wrong.
And so, every morning he stood beside his desk, with his hand over his heart, and promised to respect Her for the rest of his days.
When times were hard, and the grain elevators stood empty against the black Midwestern sky, She gave him praise for a hard day's work, and hope for his father. And She promised there would be better days to come.
And he sat by the radio and cried angry tears one gray December day, when he hear that She'd been betrayed. She was hurt; She needed help. He was only twelve, but he gave Her all he could: scraps of paper and tin cans and even the rubber tires from his wagon. He followed Her across the sea, on the maps and the newspaper, wishing he was older, old enough to fight back.
Then after four long, dark years, he heard the church bells ring and the noon whistle blow long and high. And he was part of one brief moment when all the world paid respect to Her.
And then he was grown up; and suddenly, the world had changed. And there were questions about Her. Some thought She was old-fashioned, useless. Some thought She was dead. But then after all, maybe they hadn't known Her as he had.
And now everyone has grown older. The boy, his children, and She too. He saw Her again just the other day: it was one of those bright, summer mornings and the church bells were ringing again. The bands were playing, and even the noon whistle was blowing, early.
He stood and watched proudly as She passed by. The sunlight catching the flash of crimson and white, stars blazing in the clear blue sky.
And then She was gone.
And he looked down through three generations into his grandson's eyes, and said, "There she goes, son. We used to call her Old Glory."WHY YOU BEEN GONE SO LONG
(Mickey Newbury)
'69 Acuff-Rose Music
Every time it rains Lord I run to my window
All I do is ring my hands and moan
Listen to that thunder roll and hear that lonesome wind blow
Tell me baby why you been gone so long
Tell me baby why you been gone so long you been gone so long now
Tell me baby why you been gone so long
Wolf is scratching at my door and I can hear that lonesome wind moan
Tell me baby why you been gone so long
Someone said they thought they saw you roarin' down in Reno
With a big oil man from San Antone
They tell me I'm a fool to pine for you but what do they know
Tell me baby why you been gone so long
Tell me baby why you been...
Tell me baby why you been...
Tell me baby why you been gone so longWell I would if I could and if I got the chance make love to you right after the dance
We'll park by the river underneath the moon on my old guitar I'll play you a tune
Well things will be right and the moon will be bright
And maybe you'll let me hold you tight
Stick around baby and give me the chance to make love to you right after the dance
Well we won't quarrel and we won't fight and maybe we'll stay out all the night
I'll hug and kiss you if you'll give me the chance
To make love to you right after the dance
We'll bill and coo and patch a little woo and maybe you'll say oh yes I do
Well I'll be the teacher if you'll take a chance
And we'll have call for preacher right after the dance
We'll bill and coo...(William S. Pitts)
Come, come, come, come.
Come to the church in the Wildwood
Oh, come to the church in the vale
No spot is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the vale.
There's a church in the valley by the Wildwood
No lovelier spot in the dale
No place is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the vale.
So sweet on a clear Sabbath morning
To list to the clear ringing bell
Its tones so sweetly are calling
Oh, come to the church in the vale.
Come, come, come, come.
Come to the church in the Wildwood
Oh, come to the church in the vale
No spot is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the vale...

(I had a bird he flew away and I guess he's gone to stay
But I see him winging on his way my flyaway bird named Yesterday)Standing on the promises of Christ my King,
Through eternal ages let his praises ring;
Glory in the highest, I will shout and sing,
Standing on the promises of God.
[Refrain:]
Standing, standing,
Standing on the promises of God my Savior;
Standing, standing,
I'm standing on the promises of God.
Standing on the promises I cannot fall,
Listening every moment to the Spirit's call,
Resting in my Savior as my all in all,
Standing on the promises of God.
[Refrain]Would you like to live in Houston
Where the cowboys come to town
Or maybe Pensacola
Where the sun shines all year ?round
Or even New York City
Where the city never sleeps
I'm offering you the option
Before you get in too deep
If you can do anything else
Baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry ?bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start
You can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't
Baby, you can stay right here
There's work up in Seattle
If you don't mind the rain
San Diego to Savannah
They'd all be glad you came
But life with me would always be
A roller coaster ride
You won't hurt my feelings
Whatever you decide
If you can do anything else
Baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry ?bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start
You can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't
Baby, you can stay right here
This place might look real good right now
But looking good don't last
But if you choose it, anyhow
I'll give you all I have (but)
If you can do anything else
Baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry ?bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start
You can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't
Baby, you can stay right hereAs he climbed in the chute, the crowd held it's breath
He was seconds from glory or moments from death
They knew with this bull, it could go either way
He said, "Let her go boys, and pray?
He hung on for eight but he couldn't get loose
That's when a clown they call Crazy came to his rescue
When the dust finally settled, they both walked away
Yeah, they became best of friends that day
The cowboy and clown, close as two brothers
Chips up or down, they could count on each other
Buckles and beers, winning and losing
Laughter and tears, broken hearts and bruises
They lived for the next final round, the cowboy and clown
From Denver to Dallas, to the Calgary stampede
They took all those towns, and a few in between
But it ended one night, in a West Texas town
The bulls either got faster, or old Crazy slowed down
Five hundred pick-ups, lights on, driving slow
A tent on the hill at the end of the road
When the last bible closed, one cowboy stayed
He said, "Let her go boys, and pray?
The cowboy and clown, close as two brothers
Chips up or down, they could count on each other
Buckles and beers, winning and losing
Laughter and tears, broken hearts and bruises
They lived for the next final round the cowboy and clownThese dance hall girls, they don't treat you kind
They give you their bodies but you never reach their minds
Well, they fill you up with lipstick lies
When they put you down some, don't ya be surprised
Is this the way it always is, here in Baltimore?
Well, I saw her mountains and I kissed her plains
I held her sunshine and I drank her rains
Well, I went so far, that I broke too fast
Thought I had me a winner picked but I came in last again
Is this the way it always is, here in Baltimore?
I must have chosen the wrong season to come down
I never realized they called this sacred ground
My sense of time, hell, I'm a week behind
I sent me a letter home but this all takes time
Gonna get some cash, gonna go back home
These dance hall girls really know how to make a man feel alone
Is this the way it always is, here in Baltimore?Sometime I thought I'd found the one love of my lifetime
Funny how your heart can fool ya sometime
Nighttime, the memories start to crawl around the nighttime
Trying to steal what little is left of my mind
They don't scare me like they used to
I never hardly ever even think about him sometime
Sometime I almost convince myself that he's not on my mind
Then again I think I hear him in the drive
Lost time, I was on occasion, days I just can't find
Picking up the phone and no one is on the line
I surprise myself I'm doing this well
I never hardly ever think about him sometime
Someone else might think I'm over him and doing fine
Someone else won't miss him quite like I do all the time
I surprise myself I'm doing this well
I never hardly ever think about him sometime
Someone else might think I'm over him and doing fine
Someone else won't miss him quite like I do all the time
I surprise myself I'm doing this well
I never hardly ever even think about him sometime[Verse 1]
Storm blew a tree down in my backyard
My axe wouldn't cut it and my saw wouldn't start
Good excuse for a trip to the hardware store
To give that little hottie workin' a thrill de' jour
I know that she digs me 'cause when I walked in
Here she come a runnin' with a can I help you grin
Like a puppy on a leash she followed me around
I left her droolin' at the mouth when I walked out
[Chorus]
But I guess you had to be there
To believe what I saw
Her blue eyes glued to my liberty coveralls
She didn't have a prayer
But I guess you had to be there
[Verse 2]
I'm pretty sure she meant to drop that can of W.D.
So I could see her bend over in her tight blue jeans
I was eye to eye with Taz and a Tweety tattoo
Forced to play a little game of peek-a-boo
Then she led me down the aisle by the pipe and glue
Asked me if I had any plumbing to do
Hands planted firm on the curve of her hip
Looked to me like she was lookin' for a little lip to lip
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
She even did that little finger thingy through her hair
Practically undressed me with her Playboy stare
I gave her back that look that she was lookin' for
I think that she forgot that we was in that store
[Chorus]
Yeah I guess you had to be there
To believe what I saw
Her blue eyes glued to my Liberty coveralls
She didn't have a prayer
But I guess you had to be thereWhen the storms of life are raging stand by me
When the storms of life are raging stand by me
When the world is tossing me like a ship upon the sea
Thou who rulest wind and water stand by me
When the midst of tribulation stand by me when the midst of tribulation stand by me
When the hosts of hell assail and my strength begins to fail
Thou who never lost a battle stand by me
[ guitar ]
When the midst of faults and failures stand by me
When the midst of faults and failures stand by me
When I do the best I can and my friends misunderstand
Thou who knowest all about me stand by me
When I'm growing old and feeble stand by me
When I'm growing old and feeble stand by me
When my life becomes a burden and I'm nearing chilly Jordan
O Thou Lily of the Valley stand by me (stand by me)[Chorus]
I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
Well, I'm losing weight and turnin' mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail
Well, I thought the day I met you, you were meek as a lamb
Just the kind to fit my dreams and plans
But now, the pace we're livin' takes the wind from my sails
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail
[Chorus]
Every night you drag me where the bright lights are found
There ain't no way to slow me down
I'm about as helpless as a leaf in a gale
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail
[Chorus]
Well, it looks like I've got a tiger by the tailTwenty-eight, shouldn't look this old
But the last ten years sure took their toll
On the girl in the picture with the plastic crown
That sea queen dress wouldn't fit her now
Like it did
Before the kids
Yeah, she loves her husband 'cause she said she would
Oh, it ain't so bad but it ain't so good
She swore she wouldn't get stuck in this town
Now she's cutting coupons two doors down
From a mall
And it goes on
Yeah, too bad love ain't a local parade
In your uncle's Corvette on a Saturday
With all the little girls waiting on you to wave
When you're seventeen
You don't know
That you won't always be
Homecoming queen
Newspaper clipping and a sash in a box
Are the only things that didn't get lost
She married a guy on the real estate sign
And it's hard to believe once upon a time
She was royalty
The girl we all wanted to be
Yeah, too bad love ain't a local parade
In your uncle's Corvette on a Saturday
With all the little girls waiting on you to wave
When you're seventeen
You don't know
That you won't always be
Homecoming queen
Or the captain of the team
And it ain't what it seems
It's just a teenage dream
Too bad love ain't a local parade
In your uncle's Corvette on a Saturday
With all the little girls waiting on you to wave
When you're seventeen
You don't know
You won't always be
You don't know
You won't always be
Homecoming queenWhen I was a little bitty baby my mama would rock me in my cradle
In those old cottonfields back home
When I was a little bitty baby my mama would rock me in my cradle
In those old cottonfields back home
Oh when those cotton bolls get rotten you can't pick very much cotton
In those old cottonfields back home
It was down in Louisiana just about a mile from Texarkana
In those old cottonfields back home
When I was a little bitty baby...
In those old cottonfields back homeWinter comes and snow
I can't marry you, you know
Without children to grow
I can't marry you, you know
Love me the way I love you
Love me the way I love you
Take a year in your hand
You can find another man
Let your unloved parts get loved
And I will be your man
Love me the way I love you
Love me the way I love you
Places you should be afraid
Into the river we will wade
Love me the way I love you
Love me the way I love youHello Harry, well hello Louie
It's so nice to be back home, where I belong.
You're lookin' swell Manny, I can tell Danny
You're still glowin', you're crowin',
You're still goin' strong
And I feel the room swayin'
for the band's playin' one of my old favorite songs from way back when,
so bridge that gap fellas,
and find me an empty lap fellas
might as well never go away again
Hello Dolly, well hello Dolly
So nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell Dolly, we can tell Dolly
You're still glowin', you're crowin',
You're still goin' strong

I'm stayin' where I'm at fellas
'Cause she'll never go away again
Hello Dolly, well hello Dolly
So nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell Dolly, we can tell Dolly

You're still goin' strong
I hear those eyes tinkle, be those eyes twinkle
and you still get glances from those handsome menGo, leave
She's better than me
Or at least she is stronger
She will make it last longer
That's nice for you
Go, leave
Don't come back
No more am I for the taking
But I can't say that my heart's not aching
It's breaking in two
I remember days when we laughed a lot
Those that weren't so good I soon forgot
We could sit and talk till words
Were coming out our ears
Not just for days or weeks or months
But it's been years
Now here they come
Here they come here come my tears
So go, leave
You said goodbye
But could it be that you are stalling
Hearts have a way of calling
When they've been trueHow did I hurt that woman she never done me wrong
I ran away and left her for a redhead Amazon
I got no brains I got no sense I never had no class
So I'm goin' down to Texas and be one more horse's ass
Yeah I'm goin' down to Texas and be one more horse's ass
I used to be your stallion but that's all in the past
So face the tail on my nose and point me towards the grass
Cause I'm goin' down to Texas and be one more horse's ass
[ guitar ]
I can't run in the hot sun and I won't run in the mud
I'm overaged for racin' and I'm overweight for stud
But I can dance and I can fight and throw a whiskey glass
I'm goin' down to Texas and be one more horse's ass
Yeah I'm goin' down to Texas and be one more horse's ass...
[ guitar ]
Yeah I'm goin' down to Texas and be one more horse's ass...
[ guitar ]
I'm goin' down to Texas and be one more horse's assThis mornin' waking up to you has changed my day forever
And I could jump right up and kiss the sun
Hm, loving you just has to be the nearest thing to heaven
I can't get over what loving you has done.
Is it really me and you lyin' here together
And more an more of this is yet to come
If having to much love for you could be it would be never
I can't get over what loving you has done.
I just don't know what to do I feel so good all over
And where is such a feeling coming from
Um, I'd love to take your hand and run across a field of clover
I can't get over what loving you has done.Oh, listen today to the story I tell,
It's sadned with tear dimmed eyes,
Of a dreadful cyclone that came this way,
And blew our schoolhouse away.
Rye Cove, Rye Cove
The place of my childhood and home,
Where in life's early morn I once loved to roam,
But now it's so silent and lone.
When the great storm appeared it darkened the air,
And the lightning flashed over the sky,
Then the children all cried, "Don't take us away,
But spare us to go back home."
Rye Cove, Rye Cove
The place of my childhood and home,
Where in life's early morn I once loved to roam,
But now it's so silent and lone.
Oh the mothers so sad and fathers the same,
They came to this horrible scene,
Then searching and crying each found their own child,
Dying on a pillow of stone.
Lord give us a home far beyond the blue skies,
Where storms and cyclones are unknown,
And there will we stand and gladly clasp hands,
With our children in their heavenly home.
Rye Cove, Rye Cove
The place of my childhood and home,
Where in life's early morn I once loved to roam,
But now it's so silent and lone.We got a bucket of Corona,
Enough stories to last all night,
About the trials and tribulations,
Of findin' Mr. Right:
Of findin' a good man.
Here's to the liars and the cheaters and the cold mistreaters;
To the Momma's boys who can't make a stand.
Here's to the superficial players;
The "I love ya" too-soon-sayers;
If you hear me girls, raise your hand:
Let's have a toast:
Here's to findin' a good man.
Blind dates an' horror stories;
Pushy gals and fast movers.
Let's dedicate this girl's night out,
To big-talkers; bad losers,
It's so hard findin' a good man.
Here's to the liars and the cheaters and the cold mistreaters;
To the Momma's boys who can't make a stand.
Here's to the superficial players;
The "I love ya" too-soon-sayers;
If you hear me girls, raise your hand:
Let's have a toast:
Here's to findin' a good man.
Julie, I know you want perfection;
Angie, you want a listener.
Lisa, your list is gettin' long,
And girls, you know me:I just want a good kisser.
Here's to the liars and the cheaters and the cold mistreaters;
To the Momma's boys who can't make a stand.
Here's to the superficial players;
The "I love ya" too-soon-sayers;
If you hear me girls, raise your hand:
Let's have a toast;
Let's have a toast:
Here's to findin' a good man.
Here's to findin' a good man.
Here's to findin' a good man.When that neon sun comes up
In the evening
And that warm red wine and the memories
Start to flow
You'll find me there
With all the others
Just looking for love
The only way we know
Oh, we're playing night games
(Oh, we're playing night games)
Love at first sight games
(First sight games)
The only way to fight pain
Under the neon lights
Oh, we're playing night games
(Oh, we're playing night games)
Looking for the right things
(Right things)
Hoping that it might bring
Two hearts together tonight
Now if you're sitting alone tonight
And feeling lonely
And you can hear that jukebox
Calling you
And if you think it's time
You found somebody
(Somebody)
Just come on down
And do what we all do
Oh, we're playing night games
(Oh, we're playing night games)
Love at first sight games
(First sight games)
The only way to fight pain
Under the neon lights
Oh, we're playing night games
(Oh, we're playing night games)
Looking for the right things
(Right things)
Hoping that it might bring
Two hearts together tonight
Oh, we're playing night games
(Oh, we're playing night games)
Love at first sight games
(First sight games)
The only way to fight pain
Under the neon lights
Oh, we're playing night games
(Oh, we're playing night games)
Looking for the right thingsGet out of bed you sleepy head
And shake a leg or two
The sun is up, pour some coffee in the cup
The rent is way past due
Could I rewind the hands of time
Back to my wasted youth
I'd lay the days all out in a line
And waste my time with you
The freeway's like a parkin' lot
And I'm runnin' low on time
I'm workin' double shifts to find
I'm barely scrapin' by
What I would give if I could live
The way the rich folks do
Just kickin' back in my cadillac
And wastin' time with you
We could take the time so hard to find
And wrestle it to the floor
Then wake up and do nothin' like it's never been done before
Sometimes at night my thoughts ignite
In dreams of great escape
A couple sticks of dynamite
And no more workin' late
I'm sure the cops would understand
They're workin' people too
And I'd like to take this chance to thank
Those hard workin' boys in blueWell, good morning, Captain
Good morning to you, Sir

Fourth time the banks overflowed

Bye bye pretty baby, baby bye bye
Well I'll probably never see y'anymore
May God bless you everywhere you go,
And it's bye bye pretty baby, baby bye bye.Too country what's that
Is it like too Republican or too Democrat
Is it too far to the left
Too far to the right
Too straight down the middle
Is it too black or too white
Are the biscuits too fluffy is the chicken too fried
Is the gravy too thick are the peas too black-eyed
Is the iced tea too sweet does it have too much tang
Are there too many lemons in mama's lemon meringue
Too country what's that
It is too many pearls of wisdom under grandpa's old hat
Is it just too old fashioned is it just too antique
Is the question too strong or the answer too weak
Are the roses too red is the sunshine too bright
Are there too many stars in the heavens at night
Are there too many fish that still jump in the stream
Is the blue sky too blue is the clean air too cleanHey baby doll, hey sweet potato
I love you now and I love you later
I'm gonna love you for your whole life through
Hey jelly bean, hey belly button
You ain't gonna have to worry 'bout nothin'
I'll be there to take good care of you
Hey there honey, you're so funny
You're gonna help me spend my money
We're gonna travel 'round the whole wide world
Hey sugar bug, you're driving me crazy
I can't believe what god gave me
Everyone's gonna know your my little girl
You brought a change in the weather
Things are just going to keep getting better
I'm gonna love you forever, I'm gonna love you
You make me feel light as a feather
We're gonna have some fun together
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna grant all your wishes
I'm gonna give you hugs and kisses
I'm gonna sing you lullabyes at night
Hey baby doll, hey sweet potato
I love you now and I love you later
When I rock you in my arms, it'll be alright
You brought a change in the weather
Things are just going to keep getting better
I'm gonna love you forever, I'm gonna love you
You make me feel light as a feather
We're gonna have some fun together
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
Hey jelly bean, hey belly button
You ain't gonna have to worry 'bout nothin'
I'll be there to take good care of you
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love youEverybody thinks that I walked out on her they're calling me a no good so and so
Why can I make them see that though I walked away
I didn't want to leave she made me go
What makes them think I'll give up everything I love
There's a lot of things that they don't know
I've been accused of everything she's guilty of I didn't want to leave she made me go
She told everyone I didn't want to stay but I'll tell you her story isn't so
I'd give anything if it were that way I didn't want to leave she made me go
[ fiddle ]
With her act I guess that she has fooled the town
With her phoney tips she's quite a show
My heart tells me that I'm the biggest fool around
Cause I love her though she made me go
She told everyone...
I didn't want to leave she made me goIt was all that she left him, the night that she left him
So he clung to her memory with all of his might
He carried it with him everywhere he went
Like a soldier who just couldn't give up the fight
He took it to work, and he brought it back home
He took it so hard, couldn't leave it alone
We all called him crazy in our little town
The way that he carried her memory around
He boxed it up when he sold their old house
It rode right beside him there in the front seat
He littered his new place with those same old heartaches
It felt right at home there with her memory
He took it to church with him three times a week
He took it to bed when he laid down to sleep
The weight of remembering just wore him down
The longer he carried her memory around
When she never came back, he gave up on Jesus
And he never darkened another church door
He took up with whiskey, and he took up with women
'Till one night he just couldn't take anymore
He cried, "God forgive me, but I've lost my will"
As he reached for that cold empty piece of blue steel
Then he put another big hole in his heart
The night that he carried her memory too farOne, one, one grain of sand
One, one, one grain of sand
Just one little grain of sand
Can change your life and ruin your plans
Undermine your house of love
Bring it tumbling down
One, one, one grain of sand
Once upon a mountain top, a castle stood
Carved out of rock and stone, iron and wood
Then one day a grain of sand
Grew into an iron latch
Undermined the mountain side
And the castle tumbled down
One, one, one grain of sand
A lover spoke an angry word that led to tears
The tears led to a quarrel, love disappeared
That word was like a grain of sand
That undermined the things they've planned
It shook up the house of love
And brought it tumbling down
One, one, one grain of sand
Just one little grain of sand
Can change your life and ruin your plans
Undermine your house of love
Bring it tumbling down
One, one, one grain of sand
One, one, one grain of sandFlat hand, open palm
Your mouth was screaming, your eyes were calm
Flat land, 23rd Psalm
Little Bo Peep, your sheep done gone
Flat hand to leave no trace
Mark where the nail went, left a scratch across your face
Flat land, glittering strand
Lover's angels banished from the sand
No eyes shine brighter
To the flailing, failing fighter
Who once held above her head
A glowing trembling lighter
No heart pounds harder to the sinking, drinking martyr
Who trembled on the bank
As her last dream boat sank
Beneath the deep and sleepless water
Holy Mary, hold the phone
I want a little baby that's all my own
Hold the line, hold me tight
I got a hole in my arm and I can't get it right
Holy flesh, howlin' bones
Run off and left me, all alone
Hopped up boy, hothouse frail
I got a hole in my arm and I know, I'm bound to fail
Blood of my blood is what you are
No wise man's gift sent from afar
Blood of my blood flows through your veins
And bound our hearts in crimson chainsWhy did you have to be so good
When you didn't mean to stay
Why did you have to be so good
If you were leaving anyway
You left impressions on my heart and in my mind
Of a love I'd never had
You loved me just long enough to make me blind
To all the hurt and pain that I had in the past
Why did you have to be so good
When you didn't mean to stay
Why did you have to be so good
If you were leaving anyway
You make me feel a way I've never felt before
You even promised me a dream
You were all that I had
Ever had and more(Dolly Parton)
When I look at you
I melt like a candle
You light a fire in me
What am I to do
I just hope I can handle
The heat and the smoke blinding me
This feeling, this fire
This burning desire
Is raging its way through my soul
And if you feel the same
Help me fan the flames
'Til we're burning out of control
Burning to know you
Burning to show you
And I've felt this way from the start
Burning with passion
I do hope it's lasting
And it's burning a hole in my heart
You kindle in me
A warm glowing feeling
A spark and a flicker of hope
It's more than a game
And like moths to a flame
We're drawn to its warmth and its glow
These embers of love
Are fueled by the notion
This could be an eternal flame
Consumed by the blaze
I fear it's too late
'Cause this torch that I hold bears your name
Oh, and I'm burning to know you
Burning to hold you
It's grown to a flame from a spark
Burning with passion
I do hope it's lasting
And it's burning a hole in my heart
Oh, I'm burning with passion
I do hope it's lasting...
I've had so many dreams fall apart...
And it's burning a hole in my heart...
I'm burning
Oh, I'm burning
Mmmm, I'm burning oh, I burning oohEvery reason not to go
I don't think you'll like it
I hear that city's cold
And the people are much warmer
Two good reasons not to go
You fight traffic all day long
Then you gotta pay to park
You have to go around locking all your doors there after dark
Don't know why you feel you gotta go somewhere
Have you ever thought about just saying here
If you let me I can give you don't you know
Every reason not to go
Their football team is lousy
No matter what they do
You can bet come Sunday they'll find a way to lose
You'll hate the way the smoke and the buildings block the sky
Got the prices jacked so high takes a million to get by
Don't know why you feel you gotta go somewhere
Have you ever thought about just saying here
If you let me I can give you don't you know
Every reason not to go
There must be something in this town
You'd be missing if you move
'Cause I know if you weren't around I'd be missing you
Don't know why you feel you gotta go somewhere
Have you ever thought about just saying here
I'm in love with you
And baby now you know every reason not to goGot a good women who cares for me
Whenever I'm in need, shes there for me
Steady as a rock and a comfort to me.
I,m a lucky man.
Got a couple of kids, They,ve turned out alright
They,ve got respect and they treat people right
In these wild times they still come home at night.
I'm a lucky man.
CHORUS
But sometimes I feel life is passin me by,
And nights I cant sleep when I close my eyes
Somtimes I feel like its out of my hands,
theres so many things I don't understand,
But I'm a lucky man, Oh! I'm a lucky man.
Got a good job down at the local mill,
Puts clothes on our backs and it pays some bills,
Come saturday night it buys a few thrills,
I'm a lucky man.
Got a few friends I can call them true,
In a tough situation they always come true,
They dont question these things that I do,
I'm a lucky man.
REPEAT CHORUS
Got a place under the open sky
I know I'm going when it comes the time,
For me to leave this old world behind
I'm a lucky man, Oh! I'm a lucky man
Oh! I'm a lucky man, Oh! I'm a lucky man.Just outside these prison bars
The hanging tree is waitin'
At sunrise I'll meet darkness
And death will say hello
Darling, touch your lips to mine
And tell me you love me
Promise me again before you go
Will you visit me on Sundays?
Will you bring me pretty flowers?
Will your big blue eyes be misty?
Will you brush away a tear?
A grave is filled with silence
If a sleeping man could hear
Darling, would I hear
Your footsteps up there?
Promise me that time won't
Separate me from your memory
That you'll remember me
Until the days of silver hair
If not for you, I know
I'd lose my mind before morning
Hold me close and
Tell me you still care
Will you visit me on Sundays?
Will you bring me pretty flowers?
Will your big blue eyes be misty?
Will you brush away a tear?
A grave is filled with silence
If a sleeping man could hear
Darling, would I hear
Your footsteps up there?Somebody get my shotgun
Somebody get my blade
Sally's been layin' with another man
And he's sleeping in my place
Somebody get my shotgun
Gonna shoot him sure as rain
You can run as fast as you want to boy
I'll kill you just the same
Somebody get my pocket blade
Gonna cut him don't you know
You can try to hide all you want to boy
There ain't nowhere to go
Somebody get my shotgun
Somebody get my blade
Sally's been layin' with another man
And he's sleeping in my place
Now Sally don't go thinkin'
That you got off so clean
I'd kill you too if I had the nerve
But I just ain't that mean
So I go and get my murder tools
I throw them in the lake
Gonna steal me an automobile
And drive so far away
Now I am a fugitive
I'm always on the run
Sally told the policeman
Exactly what I'd done
I went and got my shotgun
I went and got my blade
Killed poor Sally's lover
And I put him in the grave.
Now all you ramblin' fellas
You listen close to me
That woman she gonna bring you pain
Your heart is gonna bleed
But it ain't worth the trouble
The sufferin' or the grief
A bleeding heart is better than the penitentiary
I killed ppor Sally's lover
One dark and dreary day
Sally got another
And I got sent away
Somebody get my shotgun
Somebody get my blade
Sally's been laying with another man
And I set him in his graveYou can buy her flowers and good champagne
Write her a song on your old six-string
But if you really want to change the game tonight
Just add moonlight
If you've said everything you want to say
You're still not sure it's gonna go your way
If you're afraid that her heart's just out of sight
Just add moonlight
Kisses are sweeter and the world seems right
With that big yellow ball shining in her eyes
If you want to make her fall in love tonight
Just add moonlight
There's a secret all the poets know
There's something special in the way it grows
If you want to make a love song turn out right
Just add moonlight
Kisses are sweeter and the world seems right
With that big yellow ball shining in her eyes
If you want to make her fall in love tonight
Just add moonlight
You hold her tighter and the whole world sings
It's that magic moment that's in every girl's dreams
If you want to make her fall in love tonight
Just add moonlight
You hold her tighter and the whole world sings
It's that magic moment that's in every girl's dreams
Want to make her fall in love tonight
Just add moonlight
Kisses are sweeter and the world seems right
With that big yellow ball shining in her eyes
If you want to make her fall in love tonight
Just add moonlight
Just add moonlight
Just add moonlight
Just add moonlight(Green green it's green they say on the fireside of the hill
Green green I'm going away to where the grass is greener still)
Well I told my mama on the day I was born don't you cry when you see I'm gone
There ain't no woman gonna settle me down I gotta be travelin' on
A singin' (green green...)
There ain't nobody in this whole wide world gonna tell me how to spend my time
I'm just a good lovin' ramblin' man say buddy can ye spare me a dime
Hear me cryin' it's a (green green...)
I don't care when the sun goes down where I lay my weary head
Green green valley or rocky road it's there I'm gonna make my bed
Easy now (green green it's green they say...
Everybody let me hear ye (green green...
To where the grass is greener still to where the grass is greener still)That sleepy little campfire poppin' kinda craklin'
We were heatin' up the pork and beans
Bubba said man it don't get any better than this
If you know what I mean
We sat there for a minute listening to the crickets
Thinkin' this is pretty hard to beat
Till Jr. stood up spit in the fire
Said boys I hate to disagree
But if a bus load of women, really good looking women
Just suddenly pulled in here
Old Joe T. Garcia showed up with fajitas and a 100 gallon keg of beer and
Haggard dropped by and brought Willie with him
And they started takin' requests
Well don't get me wrong boys this is pretty good
But it could get better than this
Bill Mance and Hank Parker floated by in a boat
And volunteered to be our fishin' guides
And Richard Petty pulled up in the old '43 car
And asked us if we wanted a ride
We'd all sit around singin' poncho and
Lefty playing poker and smoking big cigars
Now don't take offense y'all I'm perfectly content
Just sittin' here under the stars
But if a bus load of women, really good lookin' women
Just suddenly pulled in here
And Old Emeril Lagasse showed up with kielbasa
And a hundred gallon keg of beer
If Haggard dropped by and brought Willie with him
And they started takin' requests
Don't get me wrong boys this is pretty good
But it could get better than thisSick of workin', sick of trying
Tired of livin', I feel like cryin'
I'm gonna take off in a big jet plane
Take me to Waikiki
Some peace and quiet where no one complains
I need a drastic change of scenery
He don't love me, I don't need him
He pushed and shoved me
And now I'm leavin'
I'll slip away while he's sleepin' it off
I've got the perfect plan
I'll leave this dump without a second thought
And I ain't never comin' back again
I've had it up to here, I can't take anymore
Winds of change are knockin' on my door
I came into town on a slow movin' train
I'm gonna blow out of here like a hurricane
I've had it up to here, I can't take anymore
Winds of change are knockin' on my door
I came into town on a slow movin' train
I'm gonna blow out of here like a hurricane
Now do like I do girls
Take my advice
If your man don't treat you right
Get even when you're leavin'
Buy a new dress, let your hair down
Brand new address, brand new town
Now there's no limit on his credit card
I think I'll go for it all
I think it's time for a brand new car
Not too big but not too small A little Ferrari
I've had it up to here, I can't take anymore
Winds of change are knockin' on my door
I came into town on a slow movin' train
I'm gonna blow out of here like a hurricane
I came into town on a slow movin' train
Now watch me blow out of here like a hurricaneNever seen a tan look so good
Sunshine's treatin' you like it should
You got to know the kind of glow you're giving off
Baby, that's dangerous
The way your hair blows in the wind
Takes me to heaven and back again
The window's down, we're ridin' 'round
I bet you don't know what I'm thinkin'
Oh, girl, you make me feel like whoa
Spinning me out of control
With every little move you're makin'
Driving me wild if you know what I'm sayin'
Hey, shoot another smile my way
You're makin' this boy go crazy
Crazy, crazy, yeah
Ain't no guessin' 'bout where you're from
When that Southern drawl slips off your tongue
Your little town is comin' out, and every time
It turns me on, baby
I can catch a buzz without a drink
That's what your body does to me
Every kiss is like a sip
I wanna taste over and over
Oh, girl, you make me feel like whoa
Spinning me out of control
With every little move you're makin'
Driving me wild if you know what I'm sayin'
Hey, shoot another smile my way
You're makin' this boy go crazy
Crazy, crazy, yeah
Whoa-oh
Oh, girl, you make me feel like whoa
Spinning me out of control
With every little move you're makin'
Driving me wild if you know what I'm sayin'
Hey, shoot another smile my way
You're makin' this boy go crazy
Crazy, crazy
I'm like, oh, girl, you make me feel like whoa
Spinning me out of control
With every little move you're makin'
Driving me wild if you know what I'm sayin'
Hey, shoot another smile my way
You're makin' this boy go crazy
Crazy, crazy
You're makin' me, you're makin' me
Makin' me go crazyAre you leaving, are you going?
Did you think you could lose that feeling
Without me knowing?
Are you wishing you'd never met me?
Does it take some train whistle blowing
To forget me?
All the losing
And the knowing that you love her still
Could be nothing to what empty hearts must feel
Tell me what an empty heart must feel
Are you leaving, are you going?
Did you think you could lose that feeling
Without me knowing?
All the losing
And the knowing that you love her still
Could be nothing to what empty hearts must feel
Tell me what an empty heart must feelThere you go again the truth begins to bend
Like a fool I hang on every word
You promise me the moon and then you change your tune
You must be a mockingbird
A mockinbird's voice sounds so sweet but he'll say anything
Oh he'll sit outside your window and sing to you all day
Oh I want you all my darlin but with me it'd be my luck
Try to hold him he flies away
Last night I sat at home waiting by the phone
Left the porch light burning all night long
But I never heard a sound he's somewhere way 'cross town
Someone else was listening to your song
Mockinbird's voice sounds so sweet but he'll say anything
He'll sit outside your window and sing to you all day
Oh I want you all my darlin but with me it'd be my luck
Try to hold him he flies away
You're just an imitation of someone who really falls in love
When you say forever what you really mean is never
I want you all my darling but with me it'd be my lick
Try to hold him he flies away
Try to hold him he flies awayAs I, walked out in the streets of Laredo.
As I, walked out in Laredo one day,
I spied a young cowboy all wrapped in white linen,
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay.
So, beat the drum slowly, play the fife lowly
Play the death march as they carry me on
Take me to green valley, lay the sod o'er,
I'm shot in the chest and I'm dying today
Let sixteen gamblers carry my coffin
Let sixteen cowbows sing me a song
Take me to green valley, lay the sod o'er,
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong
So, beat the drum slowly, play the fife lowly
Play the death march as they carry me on
Take me to green valley, lay the sod o'er,
I'm shot in the chest and I'm dying today...Hot corn cold corn bring along the demijohn
Hot corn cold corn bring along the demijohn
Hot corn cold corn bring along the demijohn
Fare thee well Uncle Bill see you in the morning yes sir
Well it's upstairs downstairs out in the kitchen (3x)
See you Uncle Bill just a raring and a pitching yes sir
Well it's old Aunt Peggy won't you fill 'em up again (3x)
Ain't had a drink since the lord knows when yes sir
Well yonder comes the preacher and the children are a crying (3x)
Chickens a running and the toenails a flying yes sirI got my mama's green eyes and my daddy's wild hair
Mama was a green eyed city girl
A perfect lady in her lace and pearls
Daddy was a wild haired country boy
And I was her little bitty bundle of joy
While daddy rock and rolled, mama rocked the cradle
We sat at the fire while she set the table
How we got together was a mystery
They sure made a mess when they made me
Chorus
I got my mama's green eyes and my daddy's wild hair
I'm a straight shootin' double barrel one of a pair
I like to go out havin' fun,
Won't share my baby with anyone
I got a restless heart and a jealous bone
I want him waitin' when I get home
Nobody ever said love was gonna be fair
Got my mama's green eyes and my daddy's wild hair
Oh daddy was drawn to the lights downtown
I know in my soul he never fooled around
He liked to go out and get a little crazy
But he never cheated on his wife or baby
Like daddy, like daughter, like mama, like me
I'm as faithful as I can be
But when the dance floor's full and my band is cookin'
You can't blame a girl for lookin'
Chorus
I got my mama's green eyes and my daddy's wild hair
I'm a straight shootin' double barrel one of a pair
I like to go out havin' fun,
Won't share my baby with anyone
I got a restless heart and a jealous bone
I want him waitin' when I get home
Nobody ever said love was gonna be fair
Got my mama's green eyes and my daddy's wild hair
I got a restless heart and a jealous bone
I want him waitin' when I get home
Nobody ever said love was gonna be fair
Got my mama's green eyes and my daddy's wild hairSatan's got river Satan's got river deep and wide so deep and wide
Satan's got a river and it's so deep and wide
And he's got folks a swimming he's got folks a swimming
In the warm smooth tire
But some day Satan's river
Yes some day Satan's river is gonna run dry it's gonna run dry
What was once a smooth river hot lava will make the tide
Stay clear of Satan's river heaven's on either side
Big yachts are sailing Satan's river so smooth
Never stopping or thinking about God's golden rule
When the river starts to sinking they'll cry I've been a fool
Satan's got river deep and wide
Satan's got river and it's so deep and wide
And he's got folks a swimming in the warm smooth tideShooting off vicious collections of words
The losers make facts by the things they have heard
And I find myself trying hard to defend them
I made decisions some right and some wrong
And I let some love go I wish wasn't gone
These things and more I wish I had not done
But I can't go back
And I don't want to
'Cause all my mistakes
They brought me to you
I have some "friends" they don't know who I am
So I write quotations around the word friends
But I have a couple that have always been there for me
And I missed some fun 'cause I worked through the dawn
Expecting your praise when I returned home
But I paid the cost 'cause I got left alone for the songs
But I can't go back
And I don't want to
'Cause all my mistakes
They brought me to youRoses pressed in a Bible bring me sweet memories of you
Roses withered and faded as same as a love I once knew
Yesterday's roses covered with teardrops
Yesterday's teardrops sparkle like dew
I'll always treasure yesterday's roses
Telling a story that never came true
Sometimes when I'm alone dear my poor heart is breaking inside
True love we might have known dear but just like the roses it died
Yesterday's roses covered with teardropsWith her little one in one arm
And the laundry in the other
She could sure use a helping hand
But that's just the life of a single mother
Somebody's calling on the phone
Somebody's knocking at the door
She forgets and burns the dinner
Throws it across the kitchen floor
And for a moment she wants to give up and break down
But nobody's crying but the baby
She ain't far from going crazy
And there are times she wonders how she's going to make it
But she's got to be strong enough for two
She's gotta do what he wouldn't do
No time for tears around here
Nobody's crying but the baby
And when the day is done
She'll tuck her angel in
She'll turn out the lights and start missing him again
Her mascara slowly runs down her face
But nobody's crying but the baby
She ain't far from going crazy
And there are times she wonders how she's going to make it
But she's got to be strong enough for two
She's gotta do what he wouldn't do
No time for tears around here
Nobody's crying
But the baby is getting older
The lonely nights are getting colder
And what she wouldn't give to have a shoulder to cry on
But she's got to be strong enough for two
She's gotta do what he wouldn't do
No time for tears around here
Nobody's crying but the baby
But the babyTake my hand for awhile explain it to me once again
Just for the sake of my broken heart
Look into my eyes and maybe I will understand
Our love I counted on was never there
You see I've thought that you might love me
So you caught me it seems off balance with the heart that's full
Of love and pretty dreams that two should share
And so I know but please before you go
Take my hand for awhile explain it to me once again
Just for the sake of my broken heartBaby I just don't get it
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume
The make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around
And I just don't know why
If I was your man, baby you'd
Never worry about what I do
I'd be coming home back to you
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman deserves good things
A fistful of diamonds, a hand full of rings
Baby you're a star, I just want to show you are
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you how true love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you
Love you, love you, love you, yeah
Listen
Your true beauty's description
Look so good that it hurts
You're a dime plus 99
And it's a shame, don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go, they stop and stare
'Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes
Out of control, baby you know
If I was your man, baby you'd
Never worry about what I do
I'd be coming home back to you
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman deserves good things
A fistful of diamonds, a hand full of rings
Baby you're a star, I just want to show you are
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection

Baby, you should let me love you
Love you, love you, love you, yeah
If I was your man, baby you'd
Never worry about what I do

Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman deserves good things
A fistful of diamonds, a hand full of rings
Baby you're a star, I just want to show you are
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you how true love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you
Love you, love you, love you, yeah
Baby, you should let me love you
Love you, love you, love you, yeah
Baby, you should let me love youIf you need me I'll be gone
The bed's still warm where you just left but it'll be colder where I've slept
I've always been where you needed me but I ain't the fool I used to be
You come home all hours of the night the fragrance on you ain't old spice
Tonight when you come draggin' home and find you need me I'll be gone
I'll be gone like the moon when the sun comes up
Gone like the dew from the buttercup
Gone like a woman treated wrong
If you need me I'll be gone
So what am I still doing here you've been doing me wrong for years
Tired of pickin' up and puttin' out I'm a leaving you lock stock and house
So bye bye baby that's it I'm packed I'm a leaving now but I'll call back
And leave this message on the code a phone sayin'
If you need me, well, I'll be gone
I'll be gone like the moon when the sun comes up
Gone like the moon when the sun comes up
I said if you need me, well, I'll be gone
If you need me I'll be gone
I said if you need me, well, I'll be gone, gone
If you need me I'll be gone gone
If you need me I'll be goneMy Sin is Pride
Will Kimbrough / Tim Littlefield
I let you walk away
I kept it all inside
Swore you?d be back someday
My Sin Is Pride
I could have reached out to you
But I felt like my hands were tied
I?m always bound to prove
My Sin Is pride
Wasted so many words
When I told the truth I lied
I never will confess
My Sin Is Pride
I?ve chosen a narrow path
Lost sight of the road so wide
But I never will look back
My Sin Is Pride
Nobody sees the pain
Nobody knows I?ve cried
I never will confess
My sin is pride
I never will confess
My Sin Is PrideCome and listen to my story
'Bout a man named Jed
A poor mountaineer,
Barely kept his family fed.
And then one day
He was shootin' at some food,
And up through the ground came a-bubblin' crude.
Oil that is, black gold, Texas tea.
Well the first thing you know
Ol' Jed's a millionaire,
Kinfolk said "Jed move away from there".
Said "California's the place you outta be".
So they loaded up the truck
And they moved to Beverly.
Hills that is, Swimming pools, movie stars.
Well now it's time to say
Goodby to Jed and all his kin,
They would like to thank
You folks for kindly droppin' in.
You're all invited back again to this locality
To have a heapin' helpin' of their hospitality.
Hillbilly that is, sit a spell, take your shoes off.
Y'all come back now, y'hear?I can have a heart of stone
Stand my ground and walk alone
Be strong when everything falls down around me
I can keep my self-control
Guard the secrets of my soul
Solid as a rock
Until you found me
Baby you move me
You shake me
You take me in your arms and make me
want to give you every little piece my heart
Baby you rock me
You roll me
There's something in the way you hold me yeah
Oh I just fall apart
Baby you break me
You roll me like a piece of clay
All my amibition melts away
Everytime my baby I'm around you
Shakin' when you hold me close
I'm unprotected and exposed
I don't know just what it is that you do
Baby you move me
You shake me
You take me in your arms and make me
want to give you every little piece my heart
Baby you rock me
You roll me
There's something in the way you hold me yeah
Oh I just fall apart
Baby you break me
All my walls com tumblin' down
They just crumble to your touch
Baby you move me
You shake me
You take me in your arms and make me
want to give you every little piece my heart
Baby you rock me
You roll me
There's something in the way you hold me yeah
Oh I just fall apart
Baby you break me
Baby you break me
Ohh ohh
I just fall apart
Baby you break meWith skin as tough as a burlap sack he had his second heart attack last summer
But he's still goin'
There's a melancholy in his eyes, for all of you who care enough to wonder why
Let me tell you
It all started back in 1957 when ole Walt Disney took him by surprise
Thats the day Old Yeller died
Well that twelve year old became a man eleven years to soon in Vietnam
With his best friend Tommy
They were tough as nails and southern born and awfully proud to wear that uniform
Then things got scary
On April 4th, Tommy left for heaven the same year the world was taken by surprise
That's the day Martin Luther died
So before you judge him you need to know there's more to that old man
Then what you see there on that barstool with the bourbon on his hand
You heard about his younger years but don't leave now theres more to hear
That might explain the pain in that old man
How quick America forgot about the only war they'd lost and life goes on
That's what they tell ya
No ticker tape no reason why, might have never seen the end of that chapter in his life
If he hadn't met Betty
They married in December 1980, no doubt it was the best day of his life
Two days before John Lennon died
So before you judge him you need to know there's more to that old man
Than what you see there on the barstool with the bourbon in his hand
Now we've covered chapter two I can almost see a change in you
There's still a lot of life in that old man
He hadn't had a drink in at least a year, to tell the truth I'm shocked he's here
But as long as he wants'em I'm gonna pour'em
Before you came in I asked him why, he raised his fragile head and wiped his eyes
Then he told me
I've seen so much in my life I've never questioned, this time the good Lord took me by surprise
Yesterday my Betty died
With skin as tough as a burlap sack he had his second heart attack last summer
But he's still goin'Oh, I know you are out there somewhere,
And I dream at night of rolls of chestnut hair,
And I would walk to California,
If I thought that by some chance you might be there.
[Chorus]
And I keep thinking I see your face,
Then it's gone without a trace,
Oh, I been every place I thought you'd be.
Why have I just gone, drifting on and on,
When baby you're the one that's lost at sea.
Oh, I have sailed the bright blue waters,
And I have overlooked an ocean full of tears.
Just for a glimpse of Heaven's daughter,
Before you smile at me and disappear.
[Chorus: x2](Dolly Parton)
Hello, are you free tonight
I like your looks, I love your smile
Could I use you for a while,
It's all wrong, but it's all right
The amber sunset glow has died
My needs are very much alive
Is it ok if I stop by
It's all wrong, but it's all right
It's all wrong, but it's all right
Just close your eyes and hold me tight
Tell me sexy lovin' lines
It's all wrong, but it's all right
It may be wrong if we make love
But I just need someone so much
And who knows it might last for life
It's all wrong, but it's all right
It's all wrong, but it's all right
Just close your eyes and hold me tight
Tell me sexy lovin' lines
It's all wrong, but it's all right
It's all wrong, but it's all right
Just close your eyes and fantasize
Tell me sexy lovin' lines
It's all wrong, but it's all right
It's all wrong, but it's all right
Just close your eyes and hold me tight
Tell me sexy lovin' lines
It's all wrong, but it's all right
It's all wrong, but it's all right
Just close your eyes and fantasize
Tell me sexy lovin' lines
It's all wrong, but it's all rightI called you today
Wanting a change
I never meant to hurt anyone
Never meant for you to pull out your guns
But feelings won't stay
In this meager parade
You're beating to a different drum
In this lack of all the luster we've become
Save your breath
You know we've both
Tried our best
But it's leaving
This might as well be done
I'm falling with the sun
When the hours getting sour won't save with time
I'm waving off the one
Who wouldn't let me run
Though we tried, it's a lie I can't keep dragging on
I'm untying this sinking stone
Don't sit on the fence
Living past tense
Holding on to wishes and words
Folding out a picture we blur
'Cause here in the end
I'm losing a friend
Fighting back a tear when it burns
Dividing up the pieces that we were
Save your breath
You know we've both
Tried our best
But it's leaving
This might as well be done
I'm falling with the sun
When the hours getting sour won't save with time
I'm waving off the one
Who wouldn't let me run
Though we tried, it's a lie I can't keep dragging on
I'm untying this sinking stone
I can't say you're all alone
I'm accepting what I own
Here lies a blanket and not a bandage
I'm unable to restrain
When the wake that we became
Is drawing me under
This might as well be done
I'm falling with the sun
When the hours getting sour won't save with time
I'm waving off the one
Who wouldn't let me run
Though we tried, it's a lie I can't keep dragging on
This might as well be done
I'm falling with the sun
When the hours getting sour won't save with time
I'm waving off the one
Who wouldn't let me run
Though we tried, it's a lie I can't keep dragging on
I'm untying this sinking stoneDid you ever wonder about the riddle
What kind of spirit lives in a fiddle
Well, its old Satan, right there a waiting
Or are you tuned with the angel band
Well, you back up and push
Back up and push
Back up and push
Back off of sin and let Glory in
You cant go wrong singing this song
Back up and push away
Now back up and push.
If you let the devil, play on your senses
Prepare to suffer the consequences
The foolish measure of the worldly pleasure
Can only drag you to the roaring fireTILL I KISSED YOU
Writer Don Everly
Never felt like this until I kissed you
How did I exist until I kissed you
Never had you on my mind
Now you're there all the time
Never knew what I missed till I kissed you, uh-huh
I kissed you, oh yeah
Things have really changed since I kissed you, uh-huh
My life's not the same now that I kissed you, oh yeah
Mmm, you got a way about you
Now I can't live without you
Never knew what I missed till I kissed you, uh-huh
I kissed you, oh yeah
CHORUS
You don't realize what you do to me
And I didn't realize what a kiss could be
Mmm, you got a way about you
Now I can't live without you
Never knew what I missed till I kissed you, uh-huh
I kissed you, oh yeah
Repeat CHORUS
I kissed you, uh-huh I kissed you, oh yeahI talked to my sister in Memphis
And told her you were movin' to town
Here's her number
She said she'd be glad to show you around
I left a map on your front seat
Just in case you lose your way
But don't worry, once you reach Sallisaw
It's all Interstate
I know you need to go
But before you do I want you to know, that I
Wish you the best
And I wish you nothing less
Than every thing you've ever dreamed of
And I hope that you find love along the way
But most of all
I wish you'd stay
I figure right about sundown
You'll be in west Tennessee
And by then
Maybe I'll understand why you had to leave
I know that you've done some changin'
And I know there's no changin' your mind
And yes I know
We've been through this a thousand times
I'm sorry for still holdin' on
I'll try to let go and I'll try to be strong, and I'll
Wish you the best
And I wish you nothing less
Than every thing you've ever dreamed of
And I hope that you find love along the way
But most of all
I wish you'd stay
Yeah everything you've ever dreamed of
And I hope that you'll find love along the way
But most of all
I wish you'd stay
I wish you'd stayI'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart
And as the door of love between us closes
Tears will fall like petals when we part
I begged you to be different, but you'll always be untrue
I'm tired of forgivin', now there's nothin' left to do
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart
I know that I should hate you after all you've put me through
But how can I be bitter when I'm still in love with you?It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long
I went across the river, laid me down to sleep
I went across the river, laid me down to sleep
I went across the river, laid me down to sleep
When I woke up, I had shackles on my feet
Don't you know
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long
I asked that judge, what's gonna be my fine?
I asked that judge, what's gonna be my fine?
I asked that judge, what's gonna be my fine?
Twenty one years on the Rocky Mountain line
Oh, it takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long
Well the train I ride, it's twenty one coaches long
The train I ride is twenty one coaches long
The train I ride is twenty one coaches long
The woman I love she's on that train and gone
Oh, it takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long
I'm worried now but I won't be worried longWe don't take away one happy moment
We won't take away any of the new
We'll do anything to make each other happy
Love is give and take but we don't take away
I never thought that love could make you feel so happy
I thought I'd found love once but I wasn't even close not even close
Well you make me want to call you sweet names at the waking of each day
For each day I love you more and we won't ever take away
We don't take away one happy moment...
Love is give and take but we don't take away take awayAs much as I love you
I don't understand you, oh girl
It's almost as though you prefer me to them
Just on the fringe of your world
As much as I love you
You're costing me part of my mind
What am I supposed to do with the part of me
That you don't want but part of the time
As much as I love you
Why do you lock me outside
And only let me in every now and then
What are you trying to hide
As much as I love you
I don't understand how you think
Don't you know that it's wrong turnin' me off and on
Like water you pour down the sink
As much as I love you
It's cold on my side of the bed
It's been another day of bein' pushed away
And I don't know what I've done or said
As much as I love you
I'm lying here wondering why
I don't take off my ring
Pack up my things leave and don't even say goodbye
Mhm, mhmWe're still together yet so far apart
Because of little Jimmy and his baby sister Sue
You pretend you'll you love me and I'll still stay with you
But just between you and me we know each other's hearts
We're still together yet so far apart
The only time we kiss at all it's for the kids to see
They don't know we're living in the world of make believe
We know if we should separate it would break their little hearts
So we're still together yet so far apart
[ steel ]
We hold hands laugh a lot till the kids're fast asleep
Then I take a walk and you start to weep
We don't talk about it cause where would we start
We're still together yet so far apart
The only time we kiss...JEZEBEL
RECORDED AS TERRY PRESTON
WRITER WAYNE SHANKLIN
Jezebel.
Jezebel.
If ever the devil was born,
Without a pair of horns
It was you,
Jezebel, it was you.
If ever an angel fell,
Jezebel,
It was you.
Jezebel, it was you.
If ever a pair of eyes,
Promised paradise.
Deceiving me, grieving me,
Leavin' me blue.
Jezebel, it was you.
If ever the devil's plan,
Was made to torment man,
It was you,
Jezebel, it was you.
'Twould be better I had I never known,
A lover such as you.
Forsaking dreams and all,
For the siren call of your arms.
Like a demon, love possessed me,
You obsessed me constantly.
What evil star is mine,
That my fate's design,
Should be Jezebel?
If ever a pair of eyes,
Promised paradise.
Deceiving me, grieving me,
Leavin' me blue.
Jezebel, it was you.
If ever the devil's plan,
Was made to torment man,
It was you,
Night an' day, every way.
Oh, Jezebel, Jezebel, Jezebel.You could say that we were destined
For one another's arms
Or maybe we were wishin'
For the moon and stars
No matter what the reason
It's a deadly game we play
These little acts of treason
Will see the light of day
You tell me you don't love her
Then tell me why you stay
You made me a believer
You said it'd be okay
Now I'm standing in the darkness
And we hold each other tight
These little acts of treason
Have never felt so right
With a passion as pure
As an angel's heart
While rivers flow
We'll never part
With a passion that's blind
To all that can see
These little acts of treason
Tell on you and me
I don't want to be a liar
I wanna tell the truth
But I'll probably burn in fire
These things I do for you
So I rage at the heavens
And I'll love you deep inside
These little acts of treason
Are so hard to hide
These little acts of treason
Have never felt so right
These little acts of treason
Are so hard to hideI was shivering, I'll admit it
I had nothing better to do
Except to wheeze my lazy wheeze
Bernadette, where are you?
Bernadette, where are you?
She gets much acclamation
For such a self proclaimed Faustian
Bernadette doesn't like doubters
She wants to fight in the Coliseum
What can you tell me of Therese and Isabelle?
Was it just fate that brought them together?
Or did they will their unusual union?
In cahoots of love or all of the above?
In cahoots of love or all of the above?Baby, now that I've found you
I won't let you go
I build my world around you
I need you so, baby even though
You don't need me now
Baby, now that I've found you
I won't let you go
I build my world around you
I need you so, baby even though
You don't need me
You don't need me no no (mm)
Baby, baby, when first we met
I knew in this heart of mine
That you were someone I couldn't forget
I said right and abide my time
Spent my life looking for that somebody
To make me feel like you
Now you tell me that you want to leave me
But darling, I just can't let you
Baby, baby, when first we met
I knew in this heart of mine
That you were someone I couldn't forget
I said right and abide my time
Spent my life looking for that somebody
To make me feel like you
Now you tell me that you want to leave me
But darling, I just can't let you

(mm mm mm)Guys are playing pool, long necks in a bucket
Bragging about their luck with the ladies in bed
Laughing when they ask him for all the dirty details
He don't say nothing, just starts shaking his head
[Chorus]
Spoken like a man devoted to a woman
Not just any woman, but the love of his life
Spoken like a man crazy about the feeling
He gets every evening when they turn out the light
Cue behind the eight, he's staring down the table
There's a cutie across the room trying to catch his eye
She walks across the bar with her number on a napkin
He gives it to a buddy with a wink and a smile
[Chorus]
He pays his tab, pulls his keys out of his pocket
The boys say, 'where you going? Just one more game
Give us one good reason why you can't hang.'
Turns at the door and just holds up his ring
[Chorus]
Spoken like a man, spoken like a man
Spoken like a manSo, this was not how you planned it.
No, oh you don't understand it.
Why, is it so misleading?
when all you really wanted became so defeating.
time, well it only got harder
thought you had one but it was another.
Then, you believed in a breakthrough
but it took you by surprise when you came out a fool.
Chorus
You gotta fail a thousand times
before you see it through.
you gotta spend your last dime
before you ever make a million.
you gotta know what brought you here
and you gotta lose to persevere.
but it's the way the sun will rise
through the darkest night.
yeah it's always been worth the fight.
hope, it can make you courageous
it started out small, but now it's contagious.
strength, it's an honor you earn
when you look back and see all the lessons you've learned.
Chorus (x2)
But you gotta fail a thousand times
before you see it through.
you gotta spend your last dime
before you ever make a million.
you gotta know what brought you here
and you gotta lose to persevere.
but it's the way the sun will rise
through the darkest night.
yeah it's always been worth the fight.
Yeah it's always been worth the fightThere are stars in the southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the seven bridges road
I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild
Sometimes there is a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Runnin' like a child from these warm stars
Down the seven bridges road
There are stars in the southern sky
And if ever you decide you should go
There is a taste of time sweet as honey
Down the seven bridges road
There are stars in the southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the seven bridges road
Down the seven bridges roadBaby baby baby
He's got you cryin' again
Baby baby baby
He's got you cryin' again
He's a good old boy but he's a Bad Old Boyfriend.
I know that he loves you
Looks like he'd show it now and then
I know that he loves you
Looks like he'd show it now and then
He's a good old boy but he's a Bad Old Boyfriend.
He kicks off his shoes throws down this coat
Opens a beer grabs the remote
Your never heard your seldom seen
A joker don't deserve a queen
Baby baby baby
Why don't you just get rid of him (Tell him to go)
He's a good old boy but he's a Bad Old Boyfriend. (That's right)
He makes you cry I'll make you laugh
He rubs you wrong I'll rub your back
Your never heard your seldom seen
A joker don't deserve a queen
Baby baby baby
Why don't you just get rid of him (Bye Bubba)
He's a good old boy but he's a Bad Old Boyfriend.
He's a good old boy but he's a Bad Old Boyfriend.
Good old boy Bad Old Boyfriend.Mama's gonna bargain with the ol' cook pot
Try to get more than what that bowler's got
Don't trim no fat, pull potatoes from a box
Mama's gonna bargain with the ol' cook pot
Mama's gonna water that gravy down
Got to make enough to go around
With five mouths to feed and Papa in the ground
Mama's gonna water that gravy round
Well thank the Lord and sit up straight
Mind your manners and clean your plate
Don't ask for seconds, savour every drop
Nothin' more comin' from that ol' cook pot
Mama's gonna bargain with the ol' cook pot
Pray to the Maker, make the hunger stop
And ask a little more than what we've got
Mama's gonna bargain with the ol' cook pot
Well thank the Lord and sit up straight
Mind your manners and clean your plate
Don't ask for seconds, savour every drop
Nothin' more comin', nothin' more comin', no, no
Mama's gonna bargain with the ol' cook pot
Try to get more than what that bowler's got
Don't trim no fat, pull potatoes from a box
Mama's gonna bargain with the ol' cook pot(Dolly Parton)
Well I remember when I was just little
Mama used to cook on an old black kettle
On an old wood stove she'd had since she was wed
Well the oven door was sprung a little bit
So we propped it up with a forked stick
But that didn't matter cause Mama kept us fed
My mama and daddy must have loved each other
Cause I had eleven sisters and brothers
And the girls worked just as hard as the boys did
There was corn to hoe then we'd go hoe it
We might have been poor but we didn't know it
We'd heard that word but we didn't know what it meant
Oh we used to have such a good life
And the days that I knew then are the happiest I've known
And oh didn't we have such a good time
It's sad to think the old black kettle's gone
Well there was nothing that pleased us any better
Than when we got an occasional letter
From kin folks livin' up north in some big town
We'd think of all the games we'd play
And we just couldn't hardly wait
When our city cousins said they'ze a comin' down
Now Mama's done away with the old black kettle
She used to cook in when I was just little
And the door ain't sprung on her electric range
That little farm and home we had
It ain't there no more and that's too bad
Folks are doin' away with the simple things
And oh we used to have such a good life
And the days that I knew then are the happiest I've known
And oh didn't we have such a good time
It's sad to think the old black kettle's goneI wanna run away
Don't come out looking 'round
Too busy dealing with it on my own
He's right behind me
Please God I can't be found
Don't cast another stone
Feel out the night, until the sunrise
The city tells me not to go 'til dawn
And if he wakes that's when my heart breaks
And I'm as good as gone
How do I lie awake now
When I know I've got to be moving on
How do I lie awake now
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong
And in the end
Will we make our amends
Just like we're face to face another dawn
And in the light, or when the moon shines
Will you take me on home?
How do I lie awake now
When I know I've got to be moving on
How do I lie awake now
When nothing's right and nothing's wrongMoonlight in a dew drop
Two miles to the ridge top
One hand on the wheel is probably
One more than I need
Bald tires in a dirt rut
Chauffeur us all the way up
We've been there enough
All we gotta do is turn the key
[Chorus]
Just like the back of your hand
I know my way around this land
Around every curve and bend
From your heart down to your soul
There ain't nothing I can't do
When it comes to loving you
It's like flying down these old back roads
I could do it with my eyes closed
We'll kill the motor when we get there
I'll pull the ribbon from your hair
We'll lay up on the hood and I can stare at you all night
And you'll say when we're over that hill
Are you gonna love me still
Well baby you know I will
It's just like riding a bike
[Chorus]
They can't tell us love is blind
Cause it brought us right where we are tonight
There ain't nothing I can't do
When it comes to loving you
It's like flying down these old back road
I could do it with my eyes closed
I could love you with my eyes closed
I could do it with my eyes closedTake your scissors and take your time
And cut along the dotted line
And follow closely my design
For I want to be what I'm cut out to be
Give me kisses warm and sweet
And dream about me while you sleep
And all your secrets I will keep
For I want to be what I'm cut out to be
Keep me with you all the time
And don't leave me alone
For a restless wind may come along
Just one puff and I'll be gone
Keep your scissors close at hand
And trim my edges now and then
And fit me in with all your plans
For I want to be what I'm cut out to be
For I want to be what I'm cut out to beYou tell me I'm too shy, a bashful sort of guy
But wait till I get you alone
I'm bolder than you know, my arms will tell you so
Just wait till I get you alone
I used to blush and hang my head and stutter and stammer
Even when I tried to call you on the phone
But love has made me brave and love is what I crave
Just wait till I get you alone
Your eyes dare me to try your kisses on the sly
Just wait till I get you alone
I'll teach you not to flirt, I'll squeeze you till it hurts
Just wait till I get you alone
I may seem bashful in the crowd don't let it fool you
You'll no better when I make your lips my own
If love is what you need I'm ready yes indeed
Just wait till I get you aloneI'm Going To Honky Tonk Heaven
To Dance Before My KING
Gonin' A Do The HOLY GHOST Two Step
And Then The Country Swing
I'll Praise YESHUA HaMASHIACH
As I Play On My Guitar
In A Line Dance Slapping Boot Leather
As I Quick Step Across The Stars
I'm Going To Honky Tonk Heaven
To Country Dance And Sing
I'm Going To Honky Tonk Heaven
To Dance Before My KING
Dancing The Polka I Won't Go Slow
Then Giving A Shout With The Cotton-Eyed Joe
Lifting My Hands In Jubilation
I'm A Child Of YHWH'S Priestly Nation
I'm Going To Waltz Across The Heavens
With A Boot Scootin' Promenade
Lifting My Praise And Singing
ABBA YHWH Thank YOU That I'm Saved
I'm Going To Honky Tonk Heaven
To Country Dance And Sing
I'm Going To Honky Tonk Heaven
To Dance Before My KING
To Dance Before My KINGSittin' alone in the moonlight
Thinking of the days gone by
Wondering about my darling
I can still hear her saying goodbye
Oh, the moon grows pale as I sit here
Each little star seems to whisper and say
Your sweetheart has found another
And now she's far, far away
Sittin' alone in the moonlight
Thinking of the days gone by
Wondering about my darling
I can still hear her saying goodbye
Oh, the moon grows pale as I sit here
Each little star seems to whisper and say
Your sweetheart has found another
And now she's far, far awayAs sit here in this loser's cathedral I hear the sad songs that the jukebox play
Then I dream about where love used to live dear
And all the things that I let slip away
With that one exception I had never cheated
But temptation and the wine they both were strong
Now we're left with the marriage on the rocks dear
Where used to stand the sweet and happy home
I'm still singing the song almost persuaded
And darling you still mean the world to me
And I'm sure that we could always be together
If you'd only have a little faith in me
Now you're back and already it's heaven
And I should thank my lucky stars above
That my woman's good to me and now forever
We'll be livin' in a house full of loveLike the weather your heart changes with each season
Springtime summer fall and winter too
Though I know I'll never understand the reason
I still wonder why each season changes you
It was springtime when I found you like the flowers
And our love grew warmer with the summer sun
In the fall I could see our love was changing
It broke my heart to see what wintertime had done
Like the weather your heart changes...
[Trumpet]
Came the spring again you said that you were sorry
And the summer brought a golden memory
In the fall I saw your love was changing
And the winter brought the same old misery
Like the weather your heart changes...Friends listen well and I'll tell you a story
I remember just like yesterday
Off a footloose you lad ran off with the circus
Much to his mama's dismay
He was cleaning up after the elephants
When the highflying trapeze girl smiled down
In search of a handsome companion because
She had just broken up with a clown
With one graceful aerial flip he was smitten
With her and her little tutu
Standing there love struck he almost stumbled
Into the elephants doing their tricks
And the ringmaster smiled tipped his top hat and said
Son bid adieu to your heart
And his words rand true right there under the bleachers
Soon after that big top went dark
Now the old bearded lady whispered be careful
On the train to the very next town
And the handful of midgets who rode unicycles
Peddled by with one smile and four frowns
So he had a vague sense of uneasiness when
His new sweetheart openned her door
And he knew when he saw the clown standing behind her
In front of her there stood one more
Now I can't tell you if it was Barnum or Bailey
To whom I handed the note
But a tall skinny fella standing on stilts
First read the words that I wrote
It said "Promise I'll never again give my heart
To a high-flying trapeze girl
Goodbye cruel circus
I'm off to join the world"Things I would do
Apologize, bite my tongue
Swallow my pride,just shut up
Change my tune,clip my wings
Take it back,everything
[Chorus]
Things I would do just to have you back again
I'd single-handly prove to you that I can
Fight for you cry for you I'd live and die for you
These are just some of the things I would do
Bury the hatchet,burn that bridge
Ride my high horse,right off that cliff
Move that mountain,cut it down to size
Seize the moment,compromise
[Chorus]
I miss your hands your face your laugh your smile
The sweet sweet kiss the one that used to drive me wild
[Chorus]
If looks could kill,I'd be shooting blanks
Stop stirring stew,start giving thanks
Stop spinning my wheels,apologize
Bite my tongue,swallow my pride
Take it back,compromise
Just shut up I'll shut upI saw a man today who said he talked to you not so long ago I think a month or two
And my mind raced back in time I prayed oh Lord don't let it show
He thinks I forgot you fifteen years ago
Fifteen years ago and I still feel the same why did he have to mention your name
I'm as broken up inside as though it's been a week or so
Makes a mighty strong love to keep a man thinking of a girl
He hasn't seen since fifteen years ago
[ steel ]
I've got a lovely wife who thinks the world of me
Promised her my love through all eternity
I've tried hard to make her happy and so far she doesn't know
I can't shake this thing of fifteen years ago
Fifteen years ago and I still feel the same why did he have to mention your name
I'm as broken up inside as though it's been a week or so
Takes a mighty long time to get a real love off your mind I know
Because I've tried since fifteen years ago
I know I've tried since fifteen years agoHer daddy hated his tattoos
But she was in love with a baby due
In September, early September
So they called the kinfolk, set up the bar
Threw some chairs out in the yard
And got a preacher, a pentecostal preacher
And the man on the evening news
Promised sunny and 72 but
You can't trust the weatherman
Makes his livin' off a lucky chance
Whole crowd was soaken wet
Mud all over momma's dress
No sign of the sun
But a sure fire sign of things to come
One thing you can plan
Is you can't trust the weatherman
Six months after the knot got tied
There were diapers and a double wide
They couldn't pay for one day they had a brainstorm
She'd pull the gun he'd crack the safe
They pulled it off and they pulled away
They were laughin' 'til they saw lights flashin'
Forecast on the radio
Never even mentioned snow but
You can't trust the weatherman
Makes his livin' off a lucky chance
Cop car hit a patch of ice
Hit a rail flipped on its side
That couple got away
Cops only had one thing to blame
Shook off the snow, threw up their hands
Said, "You can't trust the weatherman"
They hid their cash under the bed
Of that condo in Club Med
Where the chance of sunshine is
One hundred percent but
You can't trust the weatherman
Makes his livin' off a lucky chance
Hurricane came rippin' through
Tore that condo right in two
Stuff scattered everywhere
Stolen money flyin' through the air
And if you wonder how the story ends
They're back out in the sticks again
So remember when you're makin' plans
You can't trust the weatherman
You can't trust the weatherman
No, you can't, can't trust the weathermanI got drunk in Austin Texas I missed my plane in North Carolina
Spent all of my money on a long distance call
Huntsville Prison walls so high I'm so lonesome I could die
You could make a grown man cry if you wanted to
Say goodbye to Houston for me give my best to San Antone
Tell Dallas there's a change in plans I won't be comin' home
Dallas lives in Winston Salem we got married in West Virginia
Then we moved to Texas on a fifty acre farm
I robbed a bank and shot a man ended up in Birmingham
But I guess I tipped my hand and wound up in the pen
Say goodbye to Houston for me...
Houston is my oldest daughter says she's leaving for New York City
She's gonna make her living reaching for a star
San Antone's my only son please don't tell him what I've done
Or that I had to use my gun for that I killed a man
Say goodbye to Houston for me...
Say goodbye to Houston for me...
Say goodbye to Houston for me...The first time we went all the way
I can truly say it was way beyond my wildest dreams
And I never can forget that day
We spent tangled up in satin sheets
And I never thought we'd top the time that you and I
Oh, baby that was so sweet
Even though that was incredible now I know
The best was yet to be.
The best love we ever made
Kept us up all night
And it's still growing every day
Right before our very eyes
And we're so amazed we could create
Such a priceless work of art
Oh, the best love we ever made
Is the precious child of ours
The first time our baby cried
I knew our lives were never gonna be the same
In the heart of me, a part of me
Opened up a new kind of love I can't explain
Now all this time I thought
That I was living life for you and me alone
Oh, but holding this miracle
Now I know that I was wrong
The best love we ever made
Kept us up all night
And it's still growing every day
Right before our very eyes
And we're so amazed we could create
Such a priceless work of art
Oh, the best love we ever made
Is the precious child of oursWell everybody, everybody who has reached out so far to me
Well never did we ever think that these were desperate times or misery
And they softly spoke of how it's supposed to be
Never did I think that I was so naive
So please let me be lonely tonight
For how many times I thought this was the life
But I'm not so sure I even am alive
Well I've torn apart and warded off nearly every lover every friend
Every smile was so delicate, floated around until the nights would end
And I'd wander off and then I'd find a bed
With the thought of her still dancing 'round my head
So please let me be lonely tonight
How many times I thought that you were right
But I knew that they were all Little White Lies
Oh!
You have my heart so take my money too
Look at how I've gone and made myself a fool
I couldn't please you, you never believed that I was true
So darlin', oh darlin', please let me forget about you Oh!
So please let me be lonely tonight
You know that I don't want to have to yell or fight
No I'm not the one to judge what's wrong and right
So please, let me be lonely tonight
Oh I know that in your heart you'll be just fine
So forget you ever looked into my eyesDEEP WITIN MY HEART LIES A MELODY
A SONG OF OLD SAN ANTONE
WHERE IN DREAMS I LIVE WITH A MEMORY
BENEATH THE STARS ALL ALONE
IT WAS THERE I FOUND BESIDE THE ALAMO
ENCHANTMENTS STRANGE AS THE BLUE UP ABOVE
A MOONLIT PASS THAT ONLY SHE WOULD KNOW
STILL HEARS MY BROKEN SONG OF LOVE
MOON AND ALL YOUR SPLENDOR KNOWS ONLY MY HEART
CALL BACK MY ROSE, ROSE OF SAN ANTONE
LIPS SO SWEET AND TENDER LIKE PETALS FALLING APART
SPEAK ONCE AGAIN OF MY LOVE MY OWN
BROKEN DREAMS EMPTY WORDS I KNOW
STILL LIVE IN MY HEART ALL ALONE
A MOONLIT PASS BESIDE THE ALAMO
AND MY ROSE, MY ROSE OF SAN ANTONEHold on until the feelin' is so strong
Until the ground that you walk on
Is where you stand.
This dream, it heals and it haunts me
It's tempted and taught me who I am
This town ain't yours
And this town ain't mine.
We all come here with a light in our eyes
Some will burn out.
Some will burn bright.
Some learn to fly.
Some will run for their lives.
In this town.
In this town.
Strangers, we're nothin' but strangers
When our heart's in danger
For the song we sing.
I've seen the devil inside me
But I won't let him guide me
Or take my wings
This town ain't yours
And this town ain't mine.
We all come here with a light in our eyes
Some will burn out. (Some will burn out.)
Some will burn bright. (Some will burn bright.)
Some learn to fly.
Some will run for their lives.
In this town
In this town(Dolly Parton)
Hello, I don't know me from Adam, you don't know me from Eve
I just came here tonight 'cause I was lonely
You're no Elvis Presley, I'm no Marilyn Monroe
But I do think you're sexy, just thought I'd tell you so
Hey could I have your autograph
Your name and your number on a small photograph
I'd like to know you and what you're all about
Hey could I have your autograph
I've had my eyes on you and you're worth lookin' at
Could I ask you out or should a lady do that
You may not be famous but you look like a star
You should be in movies as cute as you are
Hey could I have your autograph
Your name and your number on a small photograph
Could I interest you in a romance perhaps
Hey could I have your autograph
Got my heart in my hands and my head in the clouds
And you're everything every girl dreams about
And being with you would be heaven no doubt
What I wouldn't do for your autograph
Oh could I have your autograph
Oh could I have your autograph
Hey could I have your autograph
I like your body could I help you work it out
Maybe moving to the music playing on the phonograph
Hey could I have your autograph
Oh could I have your autograph
You know you're just the kind to makes a woman real proud
Would you take a chance on a girl from the South
Could I have your autographStanding in the station I got no destination
I'm waving my heart goodbye
I'm walking in the crowd and I'm talking out loud
I'm telling myself don't cry
And Lord Id rather not
Forget what I forgot
But I guess I'm gonna have to try
Standing in the station I got no reservation
I'm waving my heart goodbye
I know its not to blame but its leaving just the same
And nobody ever asked it why
Standing in the rain
Wondering if the train
Will stop before the tears will dry
Standing in the station its a sad situation
I'm waving my heart goodbye
Its moving down the track and it ain't looking back
And I'm feeling like I could die
A train is made to roam
Like a heart without a home
And I'm thinking maybe so was I
I wonder will tomorrow come to hide the sorrow. Will the sun forsake the sky?
And Lord Id rather not forget what I forgot but I guess I'm gonna have to try
Standing in the station I got no destination I'm waving my heart goodbye
Standing in the station I'm waving my heart goodbye
ByeHi honey, I'm workin' late again tonight
Yeah, I just called so you'd know
Liars one, believers zero
Hello baby, can I buy you a drink?
Am I married? Heavens, no
Liars two, believers zero
I see the look in her eyes
And I know that she believes
Before the night is over
She'll give herself to me
I'll hold her close and I'll kiss her lips
Tell her I love her so
Liars three, believers zero
Hey honey, I'm home
I had to work all night
With the job like mine that's how it goes
Liars four, believers zero
But wait she's not here
She's gone with all her things
She found she couldn't beat me
So she started her own game
I've checked the house and I've called her friends
Where she's gone, nobody knows
Believers one, liars zero
Believers one, liars zeroYESTERDAY'S MEMORIES
Writer Hank Cochran
Yesterday's mem'ries won't let me go Goin' to the place where we used to park Just like always, it was still and dark But it was a little too much for my poor heart Yesterday's mem'ries tore me apart Today I walked down to that little caf where we used to go And I waited for our favourite booth The one we always sat in, not too long ago But when I sat down, tears began to flow Yesterday's mem'ries won't let me go Anymore, if there's anyone around I start to cry I just say, "Excuse me, but there's a mem'ry in my eye" Oh my friends, things were mine, they ought to be That I was happy with new arms wrapped around me But as I lied, I cried, and they could see Yesterday's mem'ries, got hold of meNo chocolate in the duty free shop
Two drops of scotch
Gonna end up on his crotch, tonight
All alone, sitting on the throne
Some native tongue on the TV
Blaring like an old Peavey
He don't aim to be rude
He's fighting with his inner prude
Some pommes frites and you know
It's gonna drip on to his lap
Yes, see the man slapping it off
Travellin' will do him in
Trudging through the waves of people
'till his heart is cluttered and feeble
If you take him out of this loop
He may be very easily duped
Still he beats the stampede for the duty freeWhen you look at me as if to say you need me
You don't know how close I come to giving in
But I'm trying to be strong and to keep from doing wrong
I wish you'd never come to me again
Cause baby I'm only a woman only a woman
Can't you see my heart's not made of stone
Yes baby I'm only a woman only a woman so please till you're free leave me alone
Don't you know it hurts to know her arms will hold you
Don't you know how much I wish those arms were mine
But darling till you're free please don't reach out from me
Cause I don't want our love to be that kind
Cause baby I'm only a woman only a woman o please till you're free leave me aloneI saw those blue lights flashin' over my left shoulder
He walked right up and said get off that riding mower
I said sir let me explain before you put me in the tank
She took my keys away and now she won't drive me to drink
I need a honky tonk song a cold cold beer
A hardwood floor a smoky atmosphere
A pocket full of change to last me all night long
I gotta hear old Hank a moanin' a honky tonk song
He didn't show me much compassion when I tried to walk that line
As he put those handcuffs on me I said give me one more try
He never even cracked a smile when he threw me in the car
So I said sir if you don't mind oh would you drop me off in a bar
I need a honky tonk song
I gotta hear old Hank a moanin' a honky tonk songYes more to me than anything else I've ever known
More to me than anything else I'm ever gonna see
Just your love is all that I need to depend upon
And each day that passes by you're more to me
When I'm gone away thoughts of you keep a runnin' through my mind
Like a sunny day I can feel your warm sweet love light shinin' all over me
Till I'm back in your arms again
And every time I find the feelin's stronger than it's ever been
Yes more to me...
`Til my life is through you're the one that I'll be livin' for
Every day with you I just seem to need you even more
And I want to say that I never thought I'd see
Anyone like you who cares so much for someone else like me
Cause more to me...
And each day that passes by you're more to meThe cattle are prowlin' and the coyotes are howlin'
Way out where the doggies bawl
Where spurs are jinglin', my cowboy is singin'
His lonesome cattle call
He rides in the sun till his day's work is done
And he rounds up the cattle each fall
Hmm, singin' his cattle call
For hours he will ride on the range far and wide
When the night wind blows up a squall
His heart is a feather in all kinds of weather
He sings his cattle call
He's brown as a berry from ridin' the prairie
As he rounds up the cattle each fall
Hmm, singin' his cattle callIf the whole world was a honky-tonk,
And it revolved around an old jukebox,
We'd tell our troubles to the Bar,
Over cryin' steel guitars,
And soon, they'd all be gone.
Yeah, if you asked me what I thought,
I'd say: "We'd be better off,
"If the whole world was a honky-tonk."
You could smoke that cigarette,
An' be politically incorrect.
Show off that red 'round your neck:
Not hear a single soul object.
Wouldn't need no lawyers to decide,
Who is wrong and who is right.
No need for big expensive trials:
Brother, we'd just step outside.
If the whole world was a honky-tonk,
And it revolved around an old jukebox,
We'd tell our troubles to the Bar,
Over cryin' steel guitars,
And soon, they'd all be gone.
Yeah, if you asked me what I thought,
I'd say: "We'd be better off,
"If the whole world was a honky-tonk."
Wouldn't have to pay no tax:
Just set a tip jar in the back.
If we ran low, we'd pass the hat:
I bet we'd all be in the black,
If the whole world was a honky-tonk.
And if you're lookin' love:
Someone to heal that broken heart.
Hey, buddy, you'd be in half.
You wouldn't have to go that far.
If the whole world was a honky-tonk,
And it revolved around an old jukebox,
We'd tell our troubles to the Bar,
Over cryin' steel guitars,
And soon, they'd all be gone.
If you asked me what I thought,
I'd say: "We'd be better off,
"If the whole world was a honky-tonk."
Life would be a three-chord song,
And the king would be George Jones,
If the whole world was a honky-tonk.I want to be ready

Oh, I wanna run (3x)
Oh
My love
my love
let me inside you
help me see
My love
make a difference to me
cause something about you
is something I need
Something about you is something I need (3x)
My love[Chorus]
Oh, it's cryin' time again, your gonna leave me,
I can see that far away look in your eyes,
I can tell by the way you hold me, darling,
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time
Now they say that absence
Makes the heart grow fonder,
And that tears are only rain to make love grow,
Well my love for you could never grow no stronger,
If I live to be a hundred years old
[Chorus]
Now you say that you've found someone you love better,
That's the way it's happened every time before,
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow,
Cryin' time will start when you walk out the doorRoll On Mississippi
Walking along, whistling a song
Half foot and fancy free,
A big riverboat, passing us by, she's headed for New Orleans
There she goes, disappearing around the bend.
Roll on Mississippi, you make me feel like a child again.
A cool river breeze, like peppermint leaves,
The taste of it takes me back,
Chewin' on a straw, torn overalls,
I can't hold an old straw and muddy river.
Just like a long lost friend.
Roll on Mississippi, you make me feel like a child again
Roll on Mississippi, big river roll.
You're the childhood dream that I grew up on.
Roll on Mississippi, carry me home.
Now I can see I've been away too long.
Roll on, Mississippi, roll on.
Now, when the world's spinning round, too fast for me,
And I need a place to dream.
So I come to your banks, I sit in your shade
Relive the memories
Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn
Roll on Mississippi, you make me feel like a child again
Roll on Mississippi, Big river roll
You're the childhood dream that I grew up on.
Roll on Mississippi, carry me home.
Now I can see I've been away too long.
Roll on, Mississippi, Roll on, Mississippi,
Roll on, Mississippi, Roll on
Roll on, Mississippi, Roll on
Roll on, Mississippi, Roll onA red lady bug
From out of mid air
Took a break and sat with me
Om my rockin' chair
I looked at her
She looked up at me
And we both agreed to let each other
Rest in peace
Then it was back to the sky
Oh look at her fly
Like that mama bluebird
Protecting her kids
And those dandelion wishes
Floatin' in the wind
A few bumble bees buzzin' by
O look at 'em fly
Its amazing what you see
When you stop and look at things
Well thats all it took
I got to thinkin' 'bout things
You know years are like those bees
And dandelion seeds
Gone in the blink of an eye
Oh look at 'em fly
Its amazing what you see
When you stop and look at things
Well looky there
Another red ladybug
From out of mid air
Took a break and sat with me
On my rockin' chair
La da da dum
La da da da la da da da dum
La da da dum, la da da dum
La da da da la da da da dumWell I'm back again for another night
Of trying to break free from the sadness
That I can't lay to rest
This old honky tonk sure does feel like home
And the music with the laughter seem to soothe my loneliness
Turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
From her memories driving me lonely, crazy and blue
It helps me to forget her so the louder the better
Hey mister turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
Now if a tear should fall if I should whisper her name
To some stranger I'm holdin'
while we're dancin' to an old Buck Owen's song
I know she won't mind she won't even know
She'll be dancing with a memory crying teardrops of her own
Turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
From her memories driving me lonely, crazy and blue
It helps me to forget her so the louder the better
Hey mister turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose[ Both ]
I love you you you no one else will ever do always true true true I'll forever be to you
I love you no one new will never ever do I'll always be true to you cause I love you
[ Bobby ]
The wedding bells are ringing in the chapel just over the hill
They're ringing for the wedding of my best friend Bill
He wed the girl I loved and I'd rather to die than to live I got to choose
Cause I've lost her and I've lost the friend
But there's one thing I'd never lose that's the way that she says
[ Skeeter ]
I love you you you no one else will ever do
Always true true true I'll forever be to you
[ Bobby ]
Yes in her shy sorta way I could leave you here now cause I like she was here today
She said she would always love me she would always be good and true
Yes that's one thing I'll never forget the way she says
[ Skeeter ]
I'll always be true to you cause I love you
[ Both ]
I love you you you...
I'll always be true to you cause I love youBaby, it just took one look at you
For me to change my one drink order to two
Like we already knew each other
Like we been talking all night
About a minute into our first dance
We got blindsided by your friends
All in a hurry like you had to go
Didn't they know you can't leave someone
Girl, you can't leave someone
In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
Girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?
We were gonna dance till they shut it down
People'd be staring while I spin you 'round
Thinking we were so in love, yeah
They wouldn't know we hadn't even hooked up
I'd get your number and I'd give you mine
And we'd be hanging out tomorrow night
But now I don't know where you are
I'm under these lights right here in the dark
In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
Girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?
Yeah, it's like you walked right out in the middle of a movie
Tore the back half out of a book
And no, you'll never know, girl, what you did to me
It ain't right saying goodbye
In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of what could've been our song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
But, girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?
In the middle of a memory
In the middle of a memoryOh, I was free to live and love and kill as I saw fit
I was at peace, I really was, no one I was at war with
The only common good was that we understood that laws unjust were only good for breaking
That difference legalized instead of sameness left nobody free
But that was the day before I married my conscience to the state
My taxes paid these road we laid to places of my choosing
There were no eyes up in the skies looking down into my bed
There was no government without our consent
And keys were made for anyone who just claimed it
And glass was all of every wall that framed it from sea to shining sea
But that was the day before I married my conscience to the state
Right and wrong were written on my heart and not just in the laws that condemned me
But now with Caesar satisfied I can even do the things that should offend meHe hung the moon
Raised the sun
Made the lions walk
And the rivers run
Then he sat down, looked around
And thought a bit
Said, "it's all good but that ain't quite it"
So with his mighty hand he created man
And then
[Chorus]
He had a better idea
A much better idea
He made an angel like sweet perfume
A heavenly smile, someone who
Can light up a room with a heart so true
I thank God he created me
But when I look at you I see
He had a better idea
Thought I'd have to face
This world alone
Just walk through life
Without a hand to hold
And I accepted that
I said in fact it might be nice
To live my way
Now that's paradise
Be he knew all along
I was wrong
[Chorus: x2]Sweet Rachel Ann sweet Rachel Ann when are you ever coming home
Sweet Rachel Ann we've waited here through many seasons now
We've waited here but you have not returned
When you left you promised us that you'd return someday
We miss you and our love for you still burns
Our little girl who longed to see the world beyond these hills
Sweet Rachel Ann you felt you had to go
The autumn wind again has blown the last leaves from the trees
Making room for winter's ice and snow
Sweet Rachel Ann sweet Rachel Ann oh how we miss you since you've gone
Sweet Rachel Ann sweet Rachel Ann when are you ever coming home
[ ac.guitar ]
Spring had kissed the earth again wait what's that I see
Is it someone running up the path
Oh wait a minute could it be Rachel is that you
Sweet Rachel Ann have you come home at last
Rachel I hardly recognize you now you look so tired and thin
Sweet Rachel Ann you're different than before
And that world that lies beyond these hills well it's hurt you Rachel Ann
But now you're home and nothing's gonna ever hurt you not anymore
Sweet Rachel Ann sweet Rachel Ann our love will make you good as new again
Sweet Rachel Ann sweet Rachel Ann
At last you have come home sweet Rachel Ann Rachel AnnYou can't get there from here
I can't live on bread and water
You heard the one about the farmer's daughter
She just needs a little atmosphere
You don't pick your occupation
I didn't ask for this frustration
I need a life and a nice cold beer
But you can't get there from here
If I had time to think about it
I'd build a castle in the yard
For all the things I want so much
Always something I can't touch
But I guess that would be too hard
You can't get there from here
I can't live on bread and water
You heard the one about the farmer's daughter
She just needs a little atmosphere
You don't pick your occupation
I didn't ask for this frustration
I need a life and a nice cold beer
But you can't get there from here
I'm on a road that's going nowhere
Looking for a place that I belong
The wind's pushing me in all directions
But none of them look like home
And you can't get there from here
You can't live on bread and water
You heard the one about the farmer's daughter
She just needs a little atmosphere
Every right track turns out wrong
A different tune but the same old song
I need a life and a nice cold beer
But you can't get there from here
No you can't get there from hereFor thirty some odd years he faced
A grinder in the city,
Hustlin' day in day out just tryin' to survive,
He bought his wife the finer things,
And sent his kids to college,
That always took what little bit
He tried to put aside,
But through it all he had one thing
That seemed to keep him going,
A dream that someday he could leave
This city life behind,
I watched his hair turn thin and gray,
But his dream never faded,
He told me all about it
At least a thousand times.
[Chorus]
He always wanted, a place out in the country,
Where the birds sing, in the morning,
And the grass is emerald green,
A place where, he could feel the mornin' sunshine,
And sit out in the evenin',
Where the air is, fresh and clean.
It took lots of overtime
To keep his wife up with the Jonses,
And more to get his son out of
His run-ins with the law,
The more it took the more he gave,
Never once complaining,
I don't know how he ever stood
The pressure of it all.
I never thought he'd make it,
But he finally left the city,
And now he's got that special little place
To call his own,
Today I took a ride out in the country
Just to see him,
It wasn't hard to find
Because his name was on the stone.
[Chorus: x2]9:00, May 28th
The first time I saw your face
You walked up and said
I hate this place
I said, I do too
We stayed up and talked til dawn
Every night all summer long
Figuring out how to get along
Then it all fell through
And then the leaves fell too
We had sweet love
Dancing in your room all night
Couldn't stop kissing you
To save my life
Baby, baby, we had sweet love
Just cause we got off track
Don't mean we can't get back
Baby, baby to that sweet love
Love, love, sweet love
I know the third time's a charm
But you and I ain't gonna go that far
Cause if I get you back in my arms
I ain't letting go again
Cause all of my sleepless nights
They're just a waste of time
Without you I'm living a lie
And it's a lonely sin
So let's dive back in
To that sweet love
Dancing in your room all night
Couldn't stop kissing you
To save my life
Baby, baby, to that sweet love
Just cause we got off track
Don't mean we can't get back
Baby, baby to that sweet love
Love, love, sweet love
To that sweet love
Love, love, sweet love
So come on, come on
Give me one more try girl
A love like ours
Shouldn't never die, girl
So come on, come on
Bring it back to life, girl
Cause I ain't gonna lose it
Another time
Oh, sweet love
Oh, sweet
Oh, sweet
Oh, sweet love
Sweet love
Dancing in your room all night
Couldn't stop kissing you
To save my life
Woah, baby, baby
Sweet love
Dancing in your room all night
Couldn't stop kissing you
To save my life
Baby, baby, to that sweet love
Just cause we got off track
Don't mean we can't get back
Baby, baby to that sweet love
Love, love, sweet love
To that sweet love
Love, love, love
Oh, sweet loveFolks call me a maverick
Guess I ain't too diplomatic
I just never been the kind to go along
Just avoidin' confrontation
For the sake of conformation
And I'll admit I tend to sing a different song
But sometimes you just can't be afraid
To wear a different hat
If Columbus had complied
This old world might still be flat
Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained
Sometimes you've got to go against the grain
Well, I have been accused
Of makin' my own rules
There must be rebel blood
Just a-runnin' through my veins
But I ain't no hypocrite
What you see is what you get
And that's the only way I know
To play the game
Old Noah took much ridicule
For building his great ark
But after forty days and forty nights
He was lookin' pretty smart
Sometimes it's best to brave the wind and rain
By havin' strength to go against the grain
Well, there's more folks than a few
Who share my point of view
But they're worried
If they're gonna sink or swim
They'd like to buck the system
But the deck is tacked against 'em
And they're a little scared
To go out on a limb
But if you're gonna leave your mark
You can't follow like a bunch of sheep
You got to listen to your heart
Go bustin' in like old John Wayne
Sometimes you got to go against the grain
Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained
Sometimes you've got to go against the grain(Rachel Dennison/Randy Parton/ Frank Dycus)
I know there's times when you must wonder
If my love is true, and I'm satisfied
I wish I knew a way to show you
I'm forever yours for the rest of my life
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'll always be here by your side
My love grows stronger as the time goes by
Cross my heart and hope to die
And all those times we're not together
You're in my heart and you're on my mind
You're like a part of me that's missing
I cross my heart and hope to die
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'll always be here by your side
My love grows stronger as the time goes by
Cross my heart and hope to die
I cross my heart and hope to die
I cross my heartBATTLE OF LOVE

(Battle of love)
For over a year I've been in love with a girl so sweet
But the guy next door has declared a war and I won't retreat
He hays he could win that pretty girl love in a minute
But I'm gonna show that boy he's not a gonna win it
We're just beginning this mighty battle of love
(Battle of love)
He was once my friend through thick and thin but now I draw a line
For he wants to be my enemy and try to take what's mine
But I know his plans so I'll take my stand and defend her
He's gonna find that I'm not the kind to surrender
I'm out for winning this mighty battle of love
(Battle of love)
Now his money's dream and the limousine that he drives is new
I can only offer this heart of mine full of love that's true
I know I'm right and ready to fight for my true love
He's tellin' it all over town that he's got another new love
So I've got to win this mighty mighty battle of love
(Battle of love)
Now they say all's fair in love and war so may the best men win
And when they say I do I'll be glad to that to meet the best men then
If he wins her love how I ever learn to live without her
Cause here she is in my arms so why should I doubt her
If I'm really winning this mighty battle of love
I'm really winning this mighty battle of loveHere comes a Baptist, here comes a Jew

We're all God's children

Yeah, we're all God's children
Why can't we be one big happy family?

In the bed of my pickup truck
My head was hangin' so heavy
I could hardly hold it up
I got to thinkin' 'bout
Sweet little woman I left all alone
And that's when I started rollin'
Drinkin' my way back home
Drinkin' my way back home
Listenin' to a honky tonk song
I hope the Devil in my soul don't steer me wrong
'Cause I'm drinkin' my way back home
I can feel that Texas sun
Down on this redneck of mine
Every time I pop top
I'm getting closer to the Arkansas line
I left a trail of Lone Star beers
From here to San Antone
So, baby, here I come, don't worry
Drinkin' my way back home
Drinkin' my way back home
Listenin' to a honky tonk song
I hope the Devil in my soul don't steer me wrong
'Cause I'm drinkin' my way back home
Drinkin' my way back home
Listenin' to a honky tonk song
I hope the Devil in my soul don't steer me wrong
'Cause I'm drinkin' my way back home
Here I come, baby(C.W. McCall, Bill Fries, Chip Davis)
One night last summer we were camped at ten thousand feet up where the air is clear, high in the Rockies of Lost Lake, Colorado. And as the fire burned low and only a few glowing embers remained, we laid on our backs all warm in our sleeping bags and looked up at the stars.
And as I felt myself falling into the vastness of the Universe, I thought about things, and places, and times.
I thought about the time my grandma told me what to say when I saw the evening star. You know, Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight. I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight.
The air is crystal-clear up here; that's why you can see a million stars.
I remember a time a bunch of us were in a canyon of the Green River in Wyoming; it was a night like this. And we had our rafts pulled up on the bank an' turned over so we could sleep on 'em, and one of the guys from New York said, "Hey! Look at the smog in the sky! Smog clear out here in the sticks!" And somebody said, "Hey, Joe, that's not smog; that's the Milky Way."
Joe had never seen the Milky Way.
And we saw the Northern Lights once, in the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana. They're like flames from some prehistoric campfire, leaping and dancing in the sky and changing colors. Red to gold, and blue to violet... Aurora Borealis. It's like the equinox, the changing of the seasons. Summer to fall, young to old, then to now. And then tomorrow...
And then everyone was asleep, except me. And as I saw the morning star come up over the mountains, I realized that life is just a collection of memories. And memories are like starlight: they go on forever.STRANGER'S STORY
(Pete Stamper)
'65 copyright control
Oh come hear a story a stranger just told me
Of a woman who meant everything
So proud he once owned her but he has her no longer
For she wears another man's ring
He talked of the good time they'd had in the springtime
Before she was stolen away
He blamed her oh no none he said she was too young
And that's why she wanted to stray
We drank to her new love that it might be true love
Her future both happy and bright
With his eyes growing misty he drank down the whiskey
That was telling his story that night
And though he didn't even know me he told me all of his story
And not one single word did he say without pride
And then he asked me if I blamed her but oh when he named her
I wanted to run out and hide
How could I tell him the man that had dealt him
His sadness and sorrow was me
I ran from the table while I was still able
To hold back my own misery
And now a wonder comes to me that maybe he knew me
And he told me just so I'd cry
But without his knowing my teardrops were flowing
For she had just told me goodbyeBuddy some Topeka night
When it?s just you and the road
Seen no tailights there for miles
And nothin? much but static on the radio
Wasn?t lookin? to the left
Wasn?t lookin? to the right
Just kept walking? like Virginia to the surf
Towards the far end of the night
Time hangs like a noose
Before me
Time stills to a crawl
Grinds so slowly
Heard my own beloved cry
I heard my one beloved moan
What?s the use in all the ache we must endure
I had no good reason why
Time hangs like a noose
Before me
Time stills to a crawl
Grinds so slowly
Not a rail to grasp ahold
Nor a savior there beside
Juat kept a walkin? like Virginia to the surf
Towards the far end of the night
Time hangs like a noose
Before me
Time stills to a crawl
Grinds so slowly
And time hangs like a noose
Around me(Dolly Parton/Bill Owens)
You lied to me
I can't believe
That I've been such a fool
I thought this time
I might find
Someone who would play by the rules
My mind said no
But my heart said go
And again I've made the wrong turn
Now here I stand
My heart in your hands...
And I've gone from burning to burned
Ah, you'd think by now
I'd know how
To keep this heart of mine safe
It goes to show
You just never know
Who can you trust these days
How could I make
The same mistake
But as far as I'm concerned
Got myself to blame
Got to close to the flame
Now I've gone from burning to burned
Everyone knows
The old saying goes
That a fool in love
Never learns
But I guess I forgot
'Cause the fire was too hot...
Now I've gone from burning to burned
Oh I guess I forgot
'Cause the fire was too hot...
Now I've gone from burning to burnedWe took off like a rocket ship to a place that we'd never been
You took me higher and higher and higher
I never thought it would end
Then I woke up to find you'd left me behind
Now what am I supposed to do
Tell me how do I get off the moon
[Chorus]
Tell me how do I get these stars from my eyes
And how do I get on with my life
How do I hold someone new when I can't let go of you
Tell me how do I get off the moon
I never planned on leaving
Guess you never planned to stay
And after we'd come so far together
How you'd just walk away and leave me up here
In this cold atmosphere lost without a clue
Tell me how do I get off the moon
[Chorus]I'll give you three guesses who loves you
Who's loved you right from the start
And not your mother who likes to baby you so
And not the boy back home you used to know oh no
There's somebody special who needs you together or apart
Bet you don't need three guesses and not even two
To know that I'm the one sweetheart
[ guitar ]
Oh yes there's somebody special...I know what you're thinking when you look at me
The love in your eyes is so easy to see
It's real and it's good what I feel for you
Love is worth living when you love like we do
I understand when you're not feeling well
If there's something on your mind I always can tell
I'm there when you need me and you're there when I need you
Love is worth living when you love like we do
Love is worth living when you love like we do
We found the happiness that very few do
You know that I want you and you know that I want you
Love is worth living when you love like we do
[ piano ]
Love is worth living...

Sticky with coke on your floorboard

You're just a fool
Just a fool
To believe you can change the world
And the world's so big it can break your heart
And you just wanna help
Not sure where to start
So you close your eyes
And send up a prayer into the dark
You're just a fool
Just a fool
To believe you can change the world
Don't listen to them when they say
You're just a fool
Just a fool
To believe you can change the world
Oh the smallest thing can all the difference
Love is alive
Don't listen to them when they say
You're just a fool
Just a fool
To believe you can change the worldMine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored
He had loosed the fateful lightening of his terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on.
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on.
In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea
With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me
As he died to make men holy let us die to make men free
While God is marching on.
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
While God is marching on.
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
While God is marching on.
His truth is marching on...I lost all my money
In a crooked poker game
Now I'm going home
On this old freight train
I got the boxcar blues
Shuffle on down the tracks
(Shuffle, shuffle on down the track)
I got the boxcar blues
And Lord, I may never get back
Well, I am so lonely
I think I could die
These ain't cinders
Tears in my eyes
I got the boxcar blues
Shuffle on down the tracks
(Shuffle, shuffle on down the track)
I got the boxcar blues
And Lord, I may never get back
I dream of my big
Baked biscuits in the pan
I dream of my woman
With another man
I got the boxcar blues
Shuffle on down the tracks
(Shuffle, shuffle on down the track)
I got the boxcar blues
And Lord, I may never get back
When I get back home
I'll get down on my knees
I'll beg to my woman
"Have a little mercy please"
I got the boxcar blues
Shuffle on down the tracks
(Shuffle, shuffle on down the track)
I got the boxcar blues
Lord, I may never get back
Now let me tell you, brother
It just ain't so
There ain't no easy life
For a bored hobo
I got the boxcar blues
Shuffle on down the tracks
(Shuffle, shuffle on down the track)
I got the boxcar blues
And Lord, I may never get back
No listen to me, brother
And take my advice
Stay away from trains
And them loaded dice
You'll get the boxcar blues
You'll shuffle on down the tracks
(Shuffle, shuffle on down the track)
You'll get the boxcar blues
And Lord, you may never get back
You'll get the boxcar blues
And Lord, you may never get back
(Shuffle, shuffle on down the track)I know where I come from
How 'bout you?
I don't need baggy clothes,
Or rings in my nose to be cool.
The scars on my knuckles,
Match these scuffs on these cowboy boots.
An' there's a whole lot more like me
How 'bout you?
I punch the clock tryin' to make it to the top
How 'bout you?
I ain't got no blue-blood trust fund,
I can dip in to.
Yeah, I wish Uncle Sam would give a damn,
About the man who's collar's blue.
But if he don't, hell, I'll make it on my own:
How 'bout you?
An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth,
I think we're the chosen few.
But that's just me
How 'bout you?
I still say: "Yes, Ma'am" to my Momma
How 'bout you?
If I shake your hand, look you in the eye,
You can bet your ass, it'll be the truth.
I cover my heart with my hat,
When they fly that Red, White and Blue,
Just like my Daddy taught me
How 'bout you?
An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth,
I think we're the chosen few.
But that's just me
Well, how 'bout you?
I like my country rockin'
How 'bout you?
Just put me on a stage, man,
Turn it up an' I'll turn it loose.
Yeah, give me a crowd that's redneck an' loud,
We'll raise the roof.
Yeah, I might just stay all night long.
How 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth,
I think we're the chosen few.
An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
'Cause, man, I know where I come from:
How 'bout you?The Chev got stuck and the Ford got stuck
But the Chev unstuck when the Dodge showed up
But the Dodge got stuck in the tractor rut,
Which eventually pulled out the Ford
With some difficulty
Well more rain than wed seen for a thousand years
Caused financial joys and biblical fears
It caused some smiles it caused some tears
But more to the point of our story
For The first time in the collective memory,
That old brown prairie that had been so dry for so long was very muddy
Boggy and sticky
Wed pull one truck out and get another stuck in
And motors would roar and tires would spin
Wed sink right down, down to the diff, and wed all take turns and do it again
Till no one could move, wed call one more friend,
Come on out here, we need youbring your truck
The Chev got stuck and the Ford got stuck
But the Chev unstuck when the Dodge showed up
But the Dodge got stuck in the tractor rut
Which eventually pulled out the Ford
And the Dodge
They got me stuck in the mud, so they couldnt rehearse
And Chavase too has missed his work
Richie, he now fears the worst, he stood up his ex wife she called him a jerk
Course Holman didnt have nothing better do to, cept ranch.
The Chev got stuck and the Ford got stuck
But the Chev unstuck when the Dodge showed up
But the Dodge got stuck in the tractor rut
Which eventually pulled out the Ford
Well it was truck after truck, we all got stuck
cept the big old four by hutterite truck
We all thought lord are we in luck!
But he wouldnt come anywhere near us,
Mighty neighborly, mighty neighborly.
So we used a lot of our backs, a little of our brains
We jacked up the jacks, and snugged up the chains,
We all did our very best to refrain from shovelin.
We put what timber we had, underneath the wheels
And we was all out of sand, but managed to steal
Two sacks of the best modern canola seed you ever did see,
That oughta give us some traction
The Chev got stuck and the Ford got stuck
But the Chev unstuck when the Dodge showed up
But the Dodge got stuck in the tractor rut
Which eventually pulled out the Ford
We spilled genetically modified canola seed
That was genetically modified for controlling the weeds
And for big old yields and margarine oil, raised hell all over that native prairie soil
Agriculture Canada is definitely gonna be looking for usFor your poison love has stained the life blood in my heart and soul dear
And I know my life will never be the same
For my pleading has all been in vain for you and you alone dear
And you know that you are guilty of the same
Into each life a love is born for one and one alone dear
The love I chose was surely not for me
For your poison love has stained the life blood in my heart and soul dear
And I know our love was never meant to be
For your poison love has stained the life blood in my heart and soul dear
And I know my life will never be the same
For my pleading has all been in vain for you and you alone dear
And you know that you are guilty of the same
But still my heart cries out for you and you alone my darling
It makes me never ever let you go
But my pleading has all been in vain for your and you alone dear
And my better judgment tells me to say noThis afternoon I walked out into a ditch
The crawfish stirred the water
The papermill blew in on the southeastern wind
And it was raining in port arthur
I pulled a dead limb from a fallen pine
The sun was dropping on the lower neches valley
I called the dogs from out of the woods with a hollar
And it was raining in port arthur
That night my daddy drove us to maw maw's
He and mama wanted to be alone
I sat up in that mimosa tree with my brother
And it was raining in port arthur
The refinerys hum and glow from the road
And I listen to the dove as she mourns
I'm standing in the rice fields of beaumont
And it was raining in port arthurNeedle and thread
Needle and thread
Keep me together
Keep me together
For one I can't control it
For two I don't believe it
For three I'm counting
As the universe expands
I'm breathing
For now, I'll try to be good
For once was careful and smart
Forever looking for a miracle
I'm dreaming
Needle and thread
Needle and thread
Keep me together
Keep me together
Fortuitous, I met a man
A long tall glass of water
Force of nature brought us closer
Now I wonder where the wind blows
Fortune won't you smile in money
And in comfort, warm and sunny
Formerly I asked for only one thing
Now I want more, I'm asking
Needle and thread
Needle and thread
Keep me together
Keep me togetherBABY'S BACK AGAIN
Writer Betty Jean Robinson
This must be my lucky day baby's back again
Said he'd never go away baby's back again
Throw my troubles to the wind happiness come right on in
Cause baby's back again
Eyes there'll never be another teardrop
Lips he's waiting just a kiss away
The future looks so bright everything's alright
Since my baby's home again to stay
This must be my lucky day...
I never saw the moon shine more brightly
All the stars came out tonight for me
He said he still loves me that's all I need to know
Cause that's the way a real love has to be
This must be my lucky day...
Cause baby's back again oh yes my baby's back again
Oh yes my baby's back againThe last thing on your lips were mine
And the last thing in my arms was you running blind
So you can see, how it might have caught me, a little off guard
That some 3 a.m. train left for Denver in the rain
With you and my heart
[Chorus]
And I just can't take a train
I just can't take the whistle or the wheels
That lonely sound, running out, on cold rails of steel
I just can't take the leavin', or you not looking back
And to this day, I just can't take a train
There's something 'bout those stations late at night
The way that silver arrow cuts a dawn horizon,
Just like a knife it reminds me of you
And that night we broke through the ice
Colorado all aboard and you rolled out like a storm
Without goodbye
[Chorus]
You could've woke me up and said I'm sorry
But this is how it's got to be
'Cause a one rail nowhere
Is such a lonely way to leave
I just can't take the leavin', or you not even looking back
And to this day, I just can't take a train
Oh, to this day, I just can't take a train.Have you ever seen a prairie wind
Make a wave on a wheat field bringing needed rain
Have you ever seen a mama stop
A baby's cry with just the touch and a whisper of his name
When she looks at me
That's what I see
[Chorus]
She's beautiful like that
Like a winter rose, snow on the ground
I was blessed the day I found her
I'm one lucky man
Cause the more I know the more I need her
The more I love the more I see her heart
Is a shining star
She's beautiful like that
Have you ever seen a purple sky
Sun coming up bringing life, to everything it shines on
Have you ever seen a couple after fifty years
Laughing and holding hands still going strong
Well the reason why
I'll love her 'til the day I die
[Chorus]
The sound of a church bell
The road that leads back home
An unspoken promise
You'll never be alone
She's beautiful like that
Just like a winter rose, snow on the ground
I was blessed the day I found her
I'm one lucky man
Cause the more I know the more I need her
The more I love the more I see her heart
Is a shining star
She's beautiful like that
She's beautiful like that
She's beautiful like thatThere are wild and rocky hills on the coast of Donegal
And the fishermen are hearty, brave and free
and the big atlantic swell
is a thing they know right well
as they fight to make their living from the sea
Chorus:
With a pleasant rolling sea and the herring running free
and our ships all gliding Gently through the foam
when the boats are loaded down
there'll be singing in the town
when the boys of killybegs come rollin home
Now you're headed out to sea and the wind is blowing free
and you cast your nets as rain begins to fall
and the clouds are riding high and the wind will soon blow by
and today you'll amybe get your bumper haul
Chorus
Well the weather's very rough and the work gets plenty touth
and the ropes will raise the welts upon your hands
but you'll never leave the sea
for whoever you may be
when it's in your blood it's hard to live on land
Chorus
Now there's purple on the hills and there's green down by the shore
and the sun has cast it's gold upon the sea
and there's silver down below where the herring fishes go
if we catch them there'll be gold for you and meI've got a bright red sticker on the back of my car
Says United States Marines
And yesterday a lady in a mini-van held up a middle finger at me
Does she think she knows what I stand for
Or the things that I believe
Just by looking at a sticker for the U.S. Marines
On the bumper of my SUV
See, my brother Chris, he's been in for more than 14 years now
Our dad was in the Navy during Vietnam
Did his duty then he got out
And my grandpa earned his purple heart
On the beach of Normandy
That's why I've got a sticker for the U.S. Marines
On the bumper of my SUV
But that doesn't mean that I want war
I'm not Republican or Democrat
But I've gone all around this crazy world
Just to try and better understand
Yes, I do have questions
I get to ask them because I'm free
That's why I've got a sticker for the U.S. Marines
On the bumper of my SUV
'Cause I've been to Hiroshima
And I've been to the DMZ
I've walked on the sand in Baghdad
Still don't have all of the answers I need
But I guess I wanna know where she's been
Before she judges and gestures to me
'Cause she don't like my sticker for the U.S. Marines
On the bumper of my SUVOl' Reuben made a train and he put it on a track
He ran it to the Lord knows where
Oh me, oh my, ran it to the Lord knows where
Shoulda been in town when Reuben's train went down
You could hear that whistle blow a hundred miles
Oh me, oh my, you could hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
Last night I lay in jail had no money to go my bail
Lord how it sleeted and it snowed
Oh me, oh my, Lord how it sleeted and it snowed
I've been to the East, I've been to the West
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
Oh me, oh my, I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
Oh, the train that I ride is a hundred coaches long
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
Oh me, oh my, you can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
I got myself a blade, laid Reuben in the shade
I'm startin' me a graveyard of my own
Oh, me, oh, lordy my, startin' me a graveyard of my own
Ol' Reuben made a train and he put it on a track
He ran it to the Lord knows where
Oh me, oh my, ran it to the Lord knows whereWell I've never loved another like I love you
You taught this cheating heart to want to stay at home
And now I know that I could never live without you
If I ever thought I could I was wrong
My heart was bleeding and my pride was all bruised
I threw caution to the wind, I had nothing left to lose
My days of running wild and no one to care for
I've left them all way behind and now
I'm knocking down your front door
My friends keep telling me that it'll never last
This crazy loving feeling, soon it's gonna pass
But day by day it's getting stronger than before
Everytime I kiss your lips I keep coming on back for so much moreI am not a devil
I am not a saint
You can't tell if the wood is good
By looking at the paint
It's not that I don't love you
Some words are just hard for me to say
I wish I was a poet
But honey I'm not built that way
I know someone hurt you
But that's all in the past
He was one to hit and run
But I don't' work like that
I'm gonna take forever
To finish what we started here today
I just can't' lie about it
Honey I'm not built that way
I'm built to go the distance
Solid as a rock
I climb all my mountains to the top
I won't' run for cover
Even when our sunny skies turn gray
Honey I'm not built that way
Saying it is one thing proving it takes time
But the thought that I don't love you
Should never cross your mind
I'm built to go the distance
Solid as a rock
I climb all my mountains to the top
I won't' run for cover
Even when our sunny skies turn gray
Honey I'm not built that way
Saying it is one thing proving it takes time
But the thought that I don't love you
Should never cross your mind
Built that way
I'm not built that wayWell, there's a special place in my memory,
Where I keep the pictures of a time an' place I left far behind.
An' I know the years have probably colored the way it really was back
Then.
But still, I like to take the memories out an' look at 'em from time to
Time.
There's a full moon t'night, on the prarie, a memory just rode into
View.
A boy, a buckskin, an' an ole spangler dawg, in the hills where the blue
Bonnets grew.
Well I was deep in the heart of Texas, just a kid 'bout 13 at the time.
Runnin' wild through the mesquite, the cedars and cactus.
It's been years, but your still on my mind.
No matter where I might wander, there's a memeory that I'll never lose.
The lonestar shines bright, in my heart tonight
I've got the blue bonnet blues
Well I remember those warm summer evenin's, playin' out under the stars.
Back then I never dreamed we'd be leavin', but I guess things just don't
Stay as they are.
Well the years and the miles came between us, but t'night as I'm
Dreamin' of you.
Once again, I'm a kid, in the sweet arms of texas...
And I've got the blue bonnet blues.
No matter where I might wander, there's a memory that I'll never lose.
'Cause the lonestar shines bright in my heart t'night.
I've got the blue bonnet blues.
The lonestar shines bright in my heart t'night
I've got the blue bonnet bluesJust Like Some Old Romantic Movie
Everything's In Black And White
We Just Couldn't Get Along Together
So Were Letting Go Tonight
Before We Let The Credits Roll
Here's A Toast To The Days Ago
Here's To You
To All The Things We Held On To
Secrets That No One Else Knewn
Here's To You
Looking Back To What We Went Through
It Is Over Now We Know that's True
Here's To You
We Found Ourselves Caught Up In Memories
Thinking Back To The Way Things Used To Be
Mom and Never Let Us Be Alone
Holding On To A Piece Of You And Me
I Know We Can't Dwell On The Past
Nothing we Can Regret Nothing We Can Take Back
Here's To You
To All The Things We Held On To
Secrets That No One Else Knewn
Here's To You
Looking Back To What We Went Through
It Is Over Now We Know that's True
Here's To You
Soooooo Soooooooo Sooooooo
Here's To You
(Yeah)
Here's To YouCastles were made high and mighty
And oceans were made deep and wide
We were made for each other, that's how I feel
About my love for you
Up in the sky is a rainbow
That some people say has no end
This I don't know it's true
But there's no end of my love for you
Living each moment, waiting for your touch
Praying each night, you'll want me half as much
Vows that are made are sometimes broken
And someone you trust and prove untrue
But I'll never be unfaithful
For you can trust in my love for you
You can trust in my love for youCandy kisses wrapped in paper mean more to you than any of mine
Candy kisses wrapped in paper you'd rather have them any old time
You don't mean it when you whisper those sweet love words in my ear
Candy kisses wrapped in paper mean more to you than mine do dear
I build a castle out of dreams dear I thought that you were building too
Now my castles all have fallen and I am left alone and blue
Once my heart was filled with gladness now there's sadness only tears
Candy kisses wrapped in paper mean more to you than mine do dearWhen I am sitting in traffic some afternoon
Or bored to death in some waiting room
I am gonna close my eyes and picture you
Today
You keep brushing that hair back out of your eyes
And it just keeps falling and so do I
I am feeling like the luckiest man alive
Today
And I don't know about tomorrow
Right now the whole world feels right
And the memory of a day like today
Can get you through the rest of your life
I know it won't always be like this
Life can change as quick as a kiss
It's not over yet and I already miss
Today
And I don't know about tomorrow
Right now the whole world is right
And the memory of a day like today
Can get you through the rest of your life
And as the seasons change and time goes by
When your hair is gray and so is mine
I know for sure that you're gonna be
Just as beautiful as you are to me
Today
Bring on tomorrow (I've got today)
Bring on tomorrow (I've got today)
Bring on tomorrow (right now the whole world is right)
Bring on tomorrow
Because the memory of a day like today
Can get your through the rest of your lifeAN HOUR AND A SIX-PACK
(Bill Anderson)
'73 Stallion Music
RECORDED BY CAL SMITH
I just got home and found a note that you left lying on my pillow case
You say you're leaving me you found another man to take my place
And then you wish me luck and say you hope that I'll get over you somehow
Honey I won't even know your name an hour and a six-pack from now
You're an hour and a six-pack away from not existing anymore
An hour and a six-pack and I won't care how much I cared before
Watch the clock pop-the-tops swallow all the pain and then the pride
And with all that we had going baby don't it hurt you knowing
My love is just an hour and a six-pack wide
I never was the kind of man who liked to stand and rummage through the ashes
When it's gone then it's gone take it out and leave it where the trash is
If you think I'll be missing you this time tomorrow baby drop around
I'm an hour and a six-pack away from being over you right now
You're an hour and a six-pack away from not existing anymore
An hour and a six-pack and I won't care how much I cared before
Watch the clock pop-the-tops smile and settle back and go to sleep
And with all that we had going don't it hurt you baby knowing
My love is just an hour and a six-pack deepWish I would have noticed sooner
All that crazy in your eyes
Do you practice in the mirror
On that tempt and crooked smile
Like the serpent in the garden
You came crawling back to me
Twice I ate that poisoned apple
Made me sick of being Eve
I'll admit that I was wrong
You said I miss you
Oh yes I do
Honey I miss you being gone
I saw that floozy you've been wooing
On your ex-best buddies arm
And I knew you'd soon be slinkin' back
Turning on the charm
Yea well, cupid ain't a bruiser
And I'm tampered throwing darts
Do you think I walk around
With a bulls-eye on my heart
Well, I'll admit that I was wrong
You said I miss you
Oh yes I do
Sugar I miss you being gone
I miss you like
Drama queens and cat fights and braces on prom night
I miss you like
Boy bands and cheap cologne our song as chaperons and probably other things that I've outgrown
Well you know you've got the mojo
But it ain't working me no more
And I swear I won't be checking you out
When you walk out my door
I'll admit that I was wrong
You said I miss you
And boy you got issues
Honey I miss you being gone
Being gone
Being gone, being gone
Thank God you're goneStanding in line at the sandwich shop
My eyes browse through the menu then came to a stop
I licked my lips and gave my tummy a rub
Something caught my eye, it was a meatball sub
Meatballs, mozarella, pepperoni
Swiss cheese, yes please, all served on a hoagie
The cashier asked how I'd be taking this treat
One for here, one to go, and make them both on wheat
I said wait, this should be more italiano
thake these back and add some romano
It felt like Burger King cuz I had it my way
But I was eating fresh cuz I was really at Subway
All that sauce, all that cheese
All those meatballs, still I'm not obese
I'd be the happiest Italian guy,
If I had meatball sandwiches stacked to the sky
Scarf some down and let the music fade
It's the meatball sandwich serenadeHello, it's been too long
My fault I haven't called
Thank you for picking up the phone
I've been swimming around
Trying hard not to drown
Waiting on my life calling to sound
And I'm hangin' on best as I can
Cause I know this whole crazy ride's in Your hands
It's Your plan
This is my white flag wave
This is me handing you the reigns
I know You can steer my hurricane
And I'll hang on best as I can
Cause I know this whole crazy ride's in Your hands
It's Your plan
It's Your plan
So I'll hang on the best as I can
Best as I can
Cause I know this whole Crazy ride's in Your hands
It's Your PlanI'm tryin to keep my eyes on this winding road
Oh, but it ain't easy
With you paintin your toes
With your feet up on the dash
Your legs so long and tan
You're my dixie girl with a summer smile
Oh just enough sweet, but just enough wild
Oh it's just that kind of day
Everything's goin our way
[Chorus]
We've got the sunshine
Coors in the back
All day and all night
Let's see where this might go
We can drive real fast
Girl, while we take it slow
We've got the warm breeze
Blowing off the coast
One hand on your knee
Yea we're getting close
I feel a good time
I feel a good time comin' on
I've got a sleeping bag thrown in the back
Oh, just in case it comes to that
With any luck this might end
At a camp fire down by the river bend
[Chorus]
Strong as anything could be
How could this be wrong girl
When we both agree
We've got the sunshine
All day and all night
We've got the sunshine
Coors in the back
All day and all night
Let's see where this might go
We can drive real fast
Girl, while we take it slow
We've got the warm breeze
Blowing off the coast
One hand on your knee
Yea we're getting close
I feel a good time
I feel a good time comin' on
I feel a good time
I feel a good time
Cool coming on
I feel a good time
I feel a good timeWell you've gotta walk that lonesome valley yes you've gotta go there by yourself
Cause no one here is gonna go there with you yes you've gotta go there by yourself
Well if you can't speak like the angels if you can't preach like old Saint Paul
You can tell the love of Jesus yes you can say that he died for all
Yes you've gotta walk...
[ dobro ]
Many loved ones away up yonder just awaitin' on the golden shore
Let's prepare to go and meet them where sad parties will come no more
Well you've gotta walk...
Yes you've gotta walk...Now I know whose got to change the way I'm living
It seems they just don't like me, the way I am
Tomorrow I may live the way they're thinkin'
Ah, but tonight I just don't give a damn
I done everything I can to make you happy
But every word I spoke you always put me down
Tomorrow my arms may ache and want to hold you
Ah, but tonight I just don't give a damn
Now I just don't care what happens to you and me
I wanted to get you on my side but you always disagree
If you should ever want to call me I'll be on my side of town?
But don't call tonight 'cause I still don't give a damn
Oh, tomorrow morning I might wake up lonely
Aw, but tonight I just don't give damnBaby you know me well you know I mean what I say
Before I say farewell I'll give you just another day
So you can find out what's happening find out what's happening before long
If you don't find out what's happening you're gonna find out that I'm gone
Tell me what you're gonna now do you better make up your mind
It all depends on you or I'm leavin' you far behind
You'd better find out what's happening find out what's happening before long
If you don't find out what's happening you're gonna find your mama gone
Well baby you know it's true we've been through thick and thin
But if you don't come through you won't ever see me again
So you'd better find out what's happening find out what's happening before long
If you don't find out what's happening you're gonna find your baby gone
Find out what's happening find out what's happeningBalled out wasted and I feel I'm going down
Balled out wasted and I feel I'm going down
Good bye darling, I've been good 'til now
I went walking with a girl as pure as milk
I went walking with a girl as pure as milk
Standing on the corner sweating through her yellow silk
Rocks in my pockets and the devil on my back
Rocks in my pockets and the devil on my back
You won't even come across the tracks
Balled out wasted and I feel I'm going down
Balled out wasted and I feel I'm going down
Good bye darling, I've been good 'til nowShe blew into this old one horse town
Like something we ain't never seen
And old Bill hired her at the Sundown Grill
She tied that apron 'round her jeans
I started hanging out there every night
Just to hear her talk and laugh
I couldn't help but fall in love with her
I should've known it wouldn't last
She always talked about Mexico
I never thought that she would really go
I felt my love could make her settle down
I guess I know better now
She's probably living down there by the sea
I wonder if she ever thinks of me
One morning she was gone like the wind
She won't be back this way again
Old Bill could tell that I was missing her
As he poured me a drink
Said, "If you put a wild bird in a cage
You'll break its will to sing"
If that's true then she's better off
Still out there wild and free
So I bought straight tequila all around
Said,"Boy, here's to her memory"
She always talked about Mexico
I never thought that she would really go
I felt my love could make her settle down
I guess I know better now
She's probably living down there by the sea
I wonder if she ever thinks of me
One morning she was gone like the wind
She won't be back this way again
She won't be back this way again
She won't be back this way again
Oh back this way again, back this way againIf you want to make some pickles
Take your time make some brine
Put all those little things you love
In vinegar and wine
It ain't Chinese algebra
It's easily done
Why you can pickle anything
Pickling is fun
A lot of people I know use dill weed
But, why don't you be more adventurous
I'll give you exactly what you need
Gonna fix your ass up real nice
Give you pickling advice
Let your intuition be your guide
Results are all that matter
Are you happy with your yeild?
Oh, come on you can tell me
I'm an expert in the field
Please don't be discouraged if your first batch is a bus
Give your ego time to heal
Persevering is a mustThe work day's done it's time to go home
It's time to make decisions I must make alone
For there's a battlefield between my home and me
And I must pass directly by the enemy
There's flashing lights straight ahead
The neon signs of the barrooms turn the sky blood red
I search for strenght inside of me
I'm passing through the homeland of the enemy
Like a dreaming man I'm in an open door
Then all the faded faces remind me I'm at war
I turn to leave and tremble when I see
The waiting patient eyes of the enemy
Their eyes shine brike they strike me blind
It's too late to run away surrenders on my mind
There's tears at home by now she's missin' me
She'll know I'm in the arms of the enemyI start every day with a smile on my face
And the feel of a kiss on my lips
When the world plays to rough I can find the healing touch
Life's never been better than this
That's what I get for loving you
Heaven's right here in my hands
A dream that is real and a heart that beats true
That's what I get for loving you
There was a time I walked outside the lines
I only thought of myself
Then you sat me down turned my head around
Now, I put you before everything else
That's what I get for loving you
Heaven's right here in my hands
A dream that is real and a heart that beats true
That's what I get for loving you
Love is a feeling I never knew much about
Forever's a word I never said until now
That's what I get for loving you
Heaven's right here in my hands
A dream that is real and a heart that beats true
That's what I get for loving you
That's what I get for loving you
Heaven's right here in my hands
A dream that is real and a heart that beats true
That's what I get for loving youYeah, I blame it all on my roots.
I showed up in boots
Ruinin' your black tie affair...
Last one to know, last one to show
I was the last one you thought you'd see there.
And I saw the surprise
That fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne.
I toasted you said honey we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain.
No, cause I got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
The beer chases my blues away
Yeah I'll be okay baby (that's right BK)
Yeah cause I'm not big on social graces
Big I slip on down to the oasis
So I got friends in low places.
(That's right boys, let's go)
I guess I was wrong, I just don't belong
Hey but damn, I've been there before.
Everything's alright, I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door.
I didn't mean to cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then.
I'll be as high as that Ivory Tower
That you're livin' in
Yeah, cause I got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away.
Yeah we'll be okay baby
Yeah, cause I'm not big on social graces
Big, I slip on down to the oasis
So I got friends in low places.
(Let's break it down)
Yeah, I guess I was wrong
I just don't belong
But damn, I've been there before.
Everything's alright, I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door.
No, I didn't mean to cause a big scene
Just wait tiI' I finish this glass
Then sweet little lady, I'll be back to the bar
(Come on B)
You can kiss my ass!
Cause I got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns,
The beer chases my blues away
I'll be okay (that's right)
Yeah cause I'm not big on social graces
Big I slip on down to oasis
So I got friends in low places.
(Ya'll know where to chill)
We got friends
(Uh-oh)
In low places, yeah
Go on and ring it out one timeIf I see you tomorrow on some street in town
Pardon me if I don't say hello (hello)
I be long to an other, it wouldn't look so good
To know someone I'm not supposed to know.
CHORUS
Just walk on by, wait on the corner
I love you, but we're strangers when we meet
Just walk on by, wait on the corner
I love you, but we're strangers when we meet.
In a dimly lit corner in a place outside of town
Tonight we'll try to say goodbye again (goodbye)
But I know it's not over, I'll call tomorrow night
I can't let you go, so why pretend.
CHORUSShine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skippidity do da day
I'm the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A.
Good morning morning
Hello sunshine
Wake up sleepy head
Why'd we move that bojangle clock so far away from the bed
Just one more minute
That's why we moved it
One more hug would do
Do you love waking up next to me
As much as I love waking up next to you
You make the coffee
I'll make the bed
I'll fix your lunch
And you fix mine
Now tell me the truth
Do these old shoes look funny
Honey it's almost nine
Now you be careful
Gotta go, I love you
Have a beautiful day,
And kiss the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A.
Skippidity do da
Thank you oh Lord for making him for me
And thank you for letting life turn out the way
That I always thought it could be
There once was a time when I could not imagine
How it would feel to say
I'm happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A
Now shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skippidity do da day
I'm the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A.
Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skippidity do da day
I'm the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A.
Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skippidity do da day
I'm the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A.There's a million oil rigs pumping that black gold all over the world
Sheiks and cowboy billionaires in limousines loaded with sparkling girls
But money can't buy happiness just listen to the stories they tell
All you need to really succeed in life is one good well
It takes one good well deep and everflowing
It takes one good well to draw from night and day
Pure and fine it's yours and mine and it's always enough
We got one good well overflowing with everlasting love
Don't it seem kinda funny how people with a lot of money only hunger for more
You think they'd learn that money can burn it's love that keeps the wolf from the door
Precious love lies deep inside hearts you can't buy and sell
When the money's low still we know we got one good well
It takes one good well...
Oh we got one good well overflowing with everlasting loveLast thing I remember was saying,
"Hey y'all, watch this." Next thing I know I'm walking toward this light
When a voice from out of nowhere asked this question.
"Garth, what did you love most in your past life?"
"Well," I said, "it had to be between cowgirls and horses."
And as I wondered which one that I would settle on,
The voice said, "May you be happy with your answer."
I said, "What answer?" He said, "Watch this." And I was gone.
[Chorus]
Now I'm back as a cowgirl's saddle
Heaven on Earth for all eternity
Forever in between
Every cowboy's dream
Riding horses, holding rodeo queens
Sew me, show me, throw me in the pickup
Take me, break me, make me what you need
It's safe to say we're made for one another
And you'll never fall if you just stick with me
Fit me, sit me, get me how you want me
Wrap me, strap me, slap me on your steed
Can't believe I'm out here flying with an angel
Oh this afterlife's sure looking up for me
[Chorus]
Loping, roping, hoping that you're happy
Racing, placing, chasing all your dreams
Makes me think if I'd lived life a little better
Would I've come back as a pair of cowgirl jeans
[Chorus]
Every cowboy's dream
You know just what I mean
Riding horses, holding rodeo queensOh, play me a blue song
fade down the light
I'm sad as a proud man can be sad tonight
Just let me dream on oh just let me sway
While the sweet violins and the saxophones play
and miss, you don't know me but can't we pretend?
that we care for each other till the band reach the end?
Oh, one step for aching
two steps for breakin'
Waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love
one step for sighing
two steps for crying
waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love
Oh, they say love's for gamblin'
the pendulum swings
I bet out on love and I lost everything
but don't send me home now
put a shot in my arm
and we'll drink out old memories and we'll drink until dawn.
and Mr. Band leader wont you play one more time
for I've got folding money in this pocket of mine
Oh, one step for aching
two steps for breakin'
Waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love
one step for sighing
two steps for crying
waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love
and miss, you don't know me but can't we pretend
that we care for each other till the band reach the end?
Oh, one step for aching
two steps for breakin'
Waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love
one step for sighing
two steps for crying
waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love

My jelly,

Sweet momma dont ya let it fallI just left San Antonio heading down to the town of Laredo
Got my mind on the border of Mexico
Gonna stop for a tank off to go at a place called a Purple Sombrero
Got my mind on the border of Mexico
Drinking tequila with young senoritas and listening to the mariachis play pretty songs
The lips of a woman will kiss me good mornin'
The same lips that promised to love me till dawn
I can tell you if you don't know what a peso can do for a gringo
Got my mind on the border of Mexico
Drinking tequila
Got my mind on the border of MexicoThey're about to turn the lights out
The car just gave out there goes this month's check
Seems like everything we own is either falling down or standing up on it's last leg
Somehow like before we'll find a way to make ends meet
Beat the wolves off the door and get back on our feet
Cause we've ridden out some bad ones just by holdin' on
To the one thing we knew would still be standing strong
Our love will be here long after the storm is gone
We were about to lose the light house
Getting tossed about on a sea of debt
Seems like every time we bailed the boat we'd spring a leak
But patch it up before we got wet
With one eye always looking out to find a better wind
We've drifted out but somehow always drifted back again
[Chorus]
And we've ridden out some bad ones just by holdin' on
To the one thing we knew would still be standing strong
Our love will be here long after the storm is goneHeard the preacher at the service
Declare you'd gone home that day
To meet the maker and his servants
And take a rest amidst his grace
He said now that you're in heaven
Your trials on earth are through
But I didn't hear him mention
If heaven's good enough for you
He claimed you feel no more sorrow
Since you're free from all life's fears
But can the blessed on God's mountain
Love you more than I down here
I was raised not to question
Promises the Bible makes
But how could the almighty
Make such a terrible mistake
Did the Lord's illumination
Shine upon you from his throne
When he witnessed my sweet angel
Suffer on the long road home
If there's really no more teardrops
And the streets are paved with gold
Send me down some reassurance
I don't believe what I've been told
If there really is a kingdom
Where you start your life anew
Won't you please somehow convince me
That heaven's good enough for youWhen you're alone and life is making you lonely you can always go Downtown
When you've got worries all the noise and the hurry seems to help I know Downtown
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty how can you lose
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles forget all your cares
So go Downtown things'll be great when you're Downtown no finer place for sure
Downtown everything's waiting for you
Now don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows Downtown
Maybe you know some little places to go to where they never close Downtown
Just listen to the rhythm of the gentle bosa nova
You'll be dancing with them too before the night gets over happy again
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles forget all your cares
So go Downtown where all the lights are bright Downtown waiting for you tonight
Downtown you've gotta be all right now
And you'll may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and need a gentle hand to guide them along
So maybe I'll see you there we can forget all our troubles forget all our cares
So go Downtown things will be great when you're Downtown no finer place for sure
Downtown everything's waiting for youOnce again it's twelve o'clock and you're still gone darling are you ever coming home
I don't mind this waiting for you while you're gone
But darling are you ever coming home
The wind outside is cold as my poor heart inside darling are you ever coming home
I love you much too much to worry bout my pride oh darling are you ever coming home
Just before I tuck them in the children question me why did daddy leaves us all alone
But I've run out of answers you've been gone so long
Oh darling are you ever coming homeWell, why don't you love me like you used to do?
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe?
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?
Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin' in a long long while
We don't get nearer or further or closer than a country mile
Why don't you spark the way you used to do
And say sweet nothings like you used to coo?
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?
Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin' in a long long while
We don't get nearer or further or closer than a country mileEmpty all my pockets take away my gold
Stripp me of my innocence leave me in the cold
Rob me of my patience and mess up my mind
If that's all it takes to love you girl
Then a truer love you'll never find than mine
Set my very soul on fire burn it to the ground
Take my little loveless world turn it upside down
Rob me of my patience...
[ strings ]
Here I am on bended knees I'll do anything to please
Your kind of love to set me free if I could only make you see me
Rob me of my patience...SNOWFALL (Key of C)
I used to think when you fell in love,
Bells rang and whistles blew
Like the fourth of July, but it was December
When I fell in love with you.
It happened like a snowfall
It came without a sound
And when I looked the world had changed
Everything was new.
I thought it was just snow fallin',
Softly comin' down.
But while I held you in my arms,
I was fallin', too.
The sky wasn't blue the very first time
I looked into your eyes.
It was heavy and gray, the middle of winter
So you took me by surprise.
It happened like a snowfall
It came without a sound
And when I looked the world had changed
Everything was new
I thought it was just snow fallin',
Softly comin' down.
But while I held you in my arms,
I was fallin', too.
TAG:
I thought it was just snow fallin',
Softly comin' down.
But while I held you in my arms,
I was fallin', too.Saturday satan Sunday saint foolin' your neighbors that's what you think
Readin' the good book singin' the hymns
Come Monday morning and he's back to a life of sin
Old brother Brown all week he steals tells everyone this big business deals
The deacon walks by a dollar hits the plate
Tryin' to buy self a ticket to the pearly gates
Old sister Rose on the very first row been a sittin' right there twenty years or so
Never hears a word when the preacher speaks
Too busy talkin' bout the bad girl down the street
Saturday satan Sunday saint...
This little song holds good advice though some people may think it ain't too nice
Well if you're one who's wearing the shoes
Well there's somebody watchin' and you ain't nobody's fool
Saturday satan Sunday saint...
Come Monday morning and he's back to a life of sinDon't it make you wanna go home now don't it make you wanna go home
All God's children get weary when they roam
Don't it make you wanna go home don't it make you wanna go home
Oh the whippoorwill roosts on the telephone poles when the Georgia sun goes down
Well it's been a long time but I'm glad to see that I'm
Goin' back down to my hometown
Goin' down to the Greyhound Station gonna buy me a one-way fare
Good Lord's willin' and the creeks don't rise watch it for I'll be right there
Don't it make you wanna go home now
But there's a six lane highway down by the creek
Where I went skinny dippin' as a child
And the drive-in show where the meadow used to grow
And the strawberries used to grow wild
There's a drag strip down by the riverside where my grandma's cow used to graze
Now the grass don't grow and the river don't flow like it did in the childhood days
Don't it make you wanna go home now
Don't it make you wanna go home don't it make you wanna go homeOh me oh my oh, look at Miss Ohio
She's a-running around with her rag-top down
She says I want to do right but not right now
Gonna drive to Atlanta and live out this fantasy
Running around with the rag-top down
Yeah I want to do right but not right now
Had your arm around her shoulder, a regimental soldier
An' mamma starts pushing that wedding gown
Yeah you want to do right but not right now
Oh me oh my oh, would ya look at Miss Ohio
She's a-runnin' around with the rag-top down
She says I want to do right but not right now
I know all about it, so you don't have to shout it
I'm gonna straighten it out somehow
Yeah I want to do right but not right now
Oh me oh my oh, look at Miss Ohio
She a-runnin' around with her rag-top down
She says I want to do right , but not right now
Oh I want to do right but not right now[ Both ]
We said our goodbyes long ago never thinking we'd miss each other so
All the memories we can't leave behind oh we must have been out of our minds
[ Skeeter ]
I've thought I loved another not you
[ Bobby ]
Oh how foolish I've thought the same too
[ Both ]
They both turned out to be the wrong kinds oh we must have been out of our minds
[ piano ]
[ Bobby ]
Let's forgive and forget the past we've known
[ Skeeter ]
We'll reap together all the wild seeds we've sowed
[ Both ]
Surely they can forgive us and find that we must have been out of our minds
[ Skeeter ]
Yes I've thought I loved another...
Yes we must have been out of our mindsSomething in your eyes makes me want to lose myself
Makes me want to lose myself in your arms
There's something in your voice makes my heart beat fast
Hope this feeling lasts the rest of my life
If you knew how lonely my life has been
And how long I've felt so low
If you knew how I wanted someone to come along
And change my life the way you've done
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
A window breaks down a long dark street
And a siren wails in the night
But I'm alright cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see through the dark there's light
If you knew how much this moment means to me
And how long I've waited for your touch
If you know how happy you are making me
I've never thought I'd love anyone so much
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belongBaby can't you see
You don't have to try so hard with me
And baby can't you see
You don't have to talk so loud to me
I'll make some time when you're around
Just come on by
Just come on by
Take a chance on me
'Cause you know and
I know we're on our way
To something new under the sun
Something new under the sun
Something new under the sun
Something new under the sun
Baby can't you see
You don't have to use that line on me
And baby can't you see
You won't ever waste your time on me
'Cause I'll ease your mind when you're down
Just come on by
Just come on by
Take a chance on me
'Cause you know and
I know we're on our way
To something new under the sun
Something new under the sun
Something new under the sun
Something new under the sun
To something new under the sun
Something new under the sun
Something new under the sun
Something new under the sun
When I look to the sky
And the spark from your eyes lights up the night
My heart is on fire
As our two universes collide
Yeah, we have arrived
Animation, we come to life
Celebration of something so right
The creation in perfect time
Of something new under the sunLet's go down to Alabama
Let's go see my dear old mama
Fryin' eggs and cookin' hammy
That's what I like 'bout the South
She's got baked ribs and candied yams
Sugar-cured Virginia hams
Basement full of those berry jams
And that's what I like about the South
Ham hocks and turnip greens
Hog jolls and butter beans
Mardi Gras down in New Orleans
That's what I like 'bout the South
Down where the trees grow tall
Where everybody says y'all
Walk on in with that Southern drawl
And that's what I like about the South
Here comes old Parson with all the news
Box back coat and button shoes
All paid up with his union dues
That's what I like 'bout the South
Did I tell you about the place called Doo-wah-diddy?
But it ain't no town and it ain't no city
It's awful small but it's mighty pretty
Doo-wah-diddy
Well, I'm not here to criticize
I'm not here to sympathize
But don't tell me them no good lies
'Cause a lyin' gal like you can devise
Every time I pass your door
You act like you don't want me no more
You just raise your head and sigh
Well I'm gonna trackin' right on by
That's what I like 'bout the SouthI feel so alone as I walk from my home with no one to help me share my blues
Oh what could be worse than be born with a curse
That everything you love you always lose
I don't feel like talkin' I just feel like walkin' and keep on a hummin' uh uh uh
[ steel ]
I'd feel better inside if I'd let go my pride
Tell all my friends exactly what you've done
But what good would it do I still wouldn't have you
Forgive me if I cry and walk and hum
I don't feel like talkin' I just feel like walkin' and keep on a hummin' uh uh uhI am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
And I bid farewell to old Kentucky
The place where I was born and raised
The place where he was born and raised
For six long years I've been in trouble
No pleasures here on earth I found
For in this world I'm bound to ramble
I have no friends to help me now
He has no friends to help him now
So it's fare thee well my old true lover
I never expect to see you again
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad
Perhaps I'll die upon this train
Perhaps he'll die upon this train
You can bury me in some dark holler
For many years where I may lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave
While he is sleeping in his graveI had to look through our old pictures
To see the way we used to smile
Before we left love in the closet
Like it just went out of style
Can we pull out those old feelin's
Wipe the hurt away like dust
Make love shine the way it used to shine
Find the gold beneath the rust
That's all I need to know
Do you want to stay together
Just say let's don't let go
And I'll keep holdin' on forever
Have the teardrops that you've cried
Drowned the fire in your eyes
Is there one flame beneath the smoke
Tell me is there any hope
That's all I need to know
Is it too late to recover
Those old smiles we used to wear
Can we save a love that once was strong
Before it breaks beyond repairI danced with an angel one night neath the stars
While cowboys were singing and playing guitars
The tune they were playing was a beautiful waltz
And they called it Bandera and the Bandera Waltz
The music so sweet seemed to whisper to me
She loves me she loves me what else can it be
Now she's gone and left me with the love that was false
But I'll remember Bandera and the Bandera Waltz
The music so sweetA little book store on a side street
I thought sure that I'd be safe
But there you were, there with her
Buying books on some romantic place
What you see in her is such a mystery to me
I hid behind my coffee cup and prayed that you would leave
I thought that I would die when I saw her kissin' you
They say, love is blind, I wish I were too
It's a small town an' word gets around
I wish you knew what everybody knows
And I keep hopin', some day you'll open
Up your eyes and let her go
She don't love you, you're just her flavor of the week
She plays with hearts but she don't play for keeps
It hurts me to watch her make a fool of you
They say, love is blind, I wish I were too
Every time I see an old Dodge truck
Or an old photograph of us
Every time I drive down by the lake
I fall into yesterday
I wish somehow that I could have you back in my life
And at the same time, I just wish that you would stay out of my sight
Cause I can see it's over, oh but I can't face the truth
They say, love is blind, I wish I were too
Oh, I wish I were tooAs American as apple pie, Mom and homemade jam
As proud as punch and peacocks, you know I am, I am
An All-American girl what knows good music and good times
Red, white and bluegrass, I'm not color blind
1st Chorus:
Red, white and bluegrass...red, white and blue
These are my true colors and I love my bluegrass, too
America, America, let pride and freedom ring
Red, white and bluegrass, let's all stand up and sing
Where else but in America can people live so free
And I'm proud of every soldier that has stood and fought for me
And I'm proud of every bluegrass band that's ever picked a lick
And I'm proud to be American, that's why I'm a singin' this
2nd Chorus:
Red, white and bluegrass...red, white and blue
These are my true colors, and I love my bluegrass, too
America, America, let pride and freedom ring
Red, white and bluegrass, let's all stand up and sing, and pick
Red, white and blue, I love my bluegrass, too
Red, white and bluegrass, don't you love it, too?
Repeat 1st Chorus
Red, white and bluegrass, the red and white and blue ooh-ooh-ooh
Blue, ooh-ooh-ooh, red, white and blue
Red, white and bluegrass, red and white and blue
Red, white and bluegrass, red and white and blue
Red, white and bluegrass, don't you love it, too?
Red, white and bluegrass, let freedom ring
Red, white and bluegrass, everybody pick and sing
Fade:
Red, white and bluegrass, red, white and blue
Red, white and blue ooh-ooh-ooh
Red, white and blueNow, there`s a place I want to show you
And don`t you know it`s not too far
And there`s a place I want to know you
Inside of my guitar
In my guitar there is a garden
Where rainbows bloom and shine like stars
If you say no, I beg you pardon
Come inside of my guitar
[Chorus]
I`ll make you laugh
And make you sing
And we can play among the stars
And we`ll make love and dance beneath the strings
Inside of my guitar
Now, there`s a feeling that I+m after
So please don`t think my love`s bizarre
But I hear music, girl, and laughter
Inside of my guitar
[Chorus]
Come inside of my guitarOn the way out I'm thinkin'
You get what you take anyway
On the way out you're watchin'
Wonder if I am gonna pay
No I'm just lookin' round
Thanks a lot
I gotta be goin' now
Will I get caught
On the way out I'm smilin'
Look nice, you might be photographed
On the way out you're thinkin'
Looks like he never put it back
Just kinda walk around
Check it out
Take two, put one down
Don't think ya saw it
Back home, another day
What'd ya get
Who needs that anyway
Know what I'm sayin'
On the way out I'm thinkin'
You get what you take anyway
On the way out you're watchin'
Wonder if I am gonna pay
No I'm just lookin' round
Thanks a lot
I gotta be goin' now
Will I get caught
On the way out
On the way out
On the way out
On the way out
On the way out
On the way outYou look good in the palm of my hands
Watch the light round your feet just dance
Feel your sweat pressed against my skin
Girl you're fire, you're fire
Take the breath right out of my chest
Burn me down 'till there ain't nothing left
Keep on doing what you do best
Girl you're fire, you're fire
There you go sliding your hand in my pocket
Lighting me up and I kinda like it
I know, oh oh oh
I know, oh oh oh
Here I am breaking into a cold hot sweat
You ain't even got started yet
I know, oh oh oh
You don't even know, oh oh oh
You're fire, you're fire
You're fire, you're fire, oh
Bring the heat
You're like a mess lying across that floor
Every step makes me want you more
Oh and you thought I wanted you before
Well girl you're fire, you're fire
There you go sliding your hand in my pocket
Lighting me up and I kinda like it
I know, oh oh oh
I know, oh oh oh
Here I am breaking into a cold hot sweat
You ain't even got started yet
I know, oh oh oh
You don't even know, oh oh oh
You're fire, you're fire
You're fire, oh
Ridin' those eyes covered in smoke
Face is red as a dirty joke
Shakin' those hips, lickin' those lips
Doin' what you do to get the whole room lit
There you go sliding your hand in my pocket
Lighting me up and I kinda like it
I know, oh oh oh
I know, oh oh oh
Here I am breaking into a cold hot sweat
You ain't even got started yet
I know, oh oh oh
You don't even know, oh oh oh
You're fire, you're fire
You're fire, you're fire, oh
YeahShe was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind me but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said, "I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round"
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in a round
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts", no
And mama always told me, "Be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do, the lie becomes the truth"
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights, law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand, her schemes and plans
Because we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
Oh think twice
She told my baby, we danced till three
Then she looked at me, then showed a photo
My baby cried, his eyes were like mine, oh no
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do, ooo
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts", no
But she came and stood right by me with a smell of sweet perfume
It happened much too soon, she called me to her room, and
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
So Billie Jean is not my lover (she just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover (she just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm mmm mmmI was meant to be by your side
And I have waited here a long time
For you to turn around and notice me
But now you're here holdin' hands with me
Walk me down the middle of the county fair
Walk me down the middle like you don't care
Walk me by the Ferris wheel and make sure that she sees
Let the whole world know you belong to me
I've heard about your bitter end
'Bout how she stole your heart and put it back again
Well I may not be the prettiest girl around
But I sure am a sight for sore, sore eyes
Walk me down the middle of main street
Walk me down where the whole town will be
I don't need no parade but make sure that she sees
Let the whole world know you belong to me
I'd walk through fire for you
Walk through barbed wire for you
I'd walk for miles, it's true
Just to be with you
If you'll walk me down the middle of my mama's church
Walk me down that aisle in your finest shirt
Let the whole world know
You will walk me down the middle of the county fair
Oh walk me down the middle like you don't care
Walk me by the Ferris wheel and make sure they all see
Let the whole world know you belong to meSolitaire I'm gettin' good at solitaire
I've got lots of times to spare I'm gettin' good without you here
Telephone I'm good at listenin' for the phone
I'm good at hopin' you call home I'm good at listenin' for the phone
I'm gettin' good at thinkin' of you I'm doin' well at cryin' too
I could be the best at bein' blue I'm gettin' good at missin' you
Bedroom walls I'm good at starin' at the walls
Dreamin' footsteps in the hall I'm good at starin' at the walls
I'm gettin' good at thinkin' of you...
I'm gettin' good at thinkin' of you...I make 6, the rent takes 5,
It ain't high livin' but I'm alive
Mac & chesse, Natrual Light,
I don't have it all but I've got time.
To live and learn man I ain't in no hurry
The only thing I don't have time to do is worry.
I got this girl, I met last week
I've seen her twice and she's calling me
She loves to laugh and drink a little wine
I'm not married yet but I've got time.
I've got time to live and learn man I ain't in no hurry
The only thing I don't have time to do right now is worry,
I can do whatever rolls across my mind cause I've got time.
Mm yeah,
Life is good, life is tough, it knocks you down, brings you luck
More days and nights mm, I'm just fine
Anythings possible cause I've got time
To live and learn man I ain't in no hurry
The only thing I don't have time to do right now is worry,
I can do whatever rolls across my mind
Yeah, cause I've got
Dreams to spare cause some may fail
But there's one out there bound to serve me well
The good Lord gave me the sense to realize
I've got everything, cause I've got time
Yeah I've got time
Yes I do oh yeah
Mm there ain't no hurry
Oh we ain't got time to worry
Yeah I've got time
Whatever rolls across my mind
I've got time oh yeahThere was a time we'd sit in the backyard cause the house would get so hot
From the summer sun there was no way of sleepin'
And you'd play your old guitar we'd fight mosquitoes and enjoyed
You backyard concerts for we had no television
We'd just begun our life as man and wife and hard ships then
Could scaresly scare us into quittin'
Things were far from bein' fine we often dined upon a dime
But there never was a time we didn't love
The Christmas brought us saddest days
When your pride gave a way you told the kids
There'd be no gifts cause we were broke
Though their little tears of grief was so hard to see it didn't hurt me
Like the love I knew was in your throat
It was then with arms entwined we both broke down and cried
For it seemed ike nothing good would ever come
The doctor bills we couldn't pay they came and took our car away
But there never was a time we didn't love
Now there's an easy chair for my back a satin pillow for your head
And the kids are wild about the brand new car
You and I can order steak with all the trimmings and not worry
If we've spent a dollar more than we can spare
No wonder in your prayers we've thanked the man upstairs who led us through
The years of rearin' kids and payin' bills
And I think he guide us not because we were smart but just because
There never was a time we didn't love
No there never was a time never was a time never was a time we didn't loveI remember how you stuck your hand in mine
Where we were on the boardwalk
When I stuck that five in a jar
For the tikibar band to play
Gettin' stuck with you in that photo booth
We stuck that picture in a bottle
I bet it's probably still floatin' down there in the Chesapeake bay
Yeah that's a hell of a memory we made
'Cause you're still stuck in my head like the song they played
That night when the cool Virginia beach rain
Soaked us both down to the bone, yeah, but we just kept on dancin'
Your shirt stuck to your skin, I was stuck to you
All night long baby, barely kept my cool cause I never wanted anybody else that much
That's where I'm still stuck, stuck stuck stuck stuck
Yeah, that's where I'm still Stuck stuck stuck stuck stuck
Stuck your bag in that taxi cab
When that week was all over
My heart stuck in my throat
When you got inside and left
I stood there tasting that last kiss
You stuck your hand out the window
And gave me that little goodbye wave
And no I never will forget, girl I still wonder if
I'm still stuck in your head like that song they played
That night when the cool Virginia beach rain
Soaked us both down to the bone, yeah, but we just kept on dancin'
Your shirt stuck to your skin, I was stuck to you
All night long baby, barely kept my cool cause I never wanted anybody else that much
That's where I'm still stuck,
Yeah, you're still stuck in my head like the song they played
That night when the cool Virginia beach rain
Soaked us both down to the bone, yeah, but we just kept on dancin'
Your shirt stuck to your skin, I was stuck to you
All night long baby, barely kept my cool cause I never wanted anybody else that much
That's where I'm still Stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck
Yes I am girl, that's where I'm still stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck
Right where you left me baby, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck
That's where I'm still stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuckI've waited all my life to find that special someone
Someone I could call my own
Someone to stick by me through good times and bad
No more playing games, I'd never be alone
Someone stole my heart and then he ran away
I gave the best I had to give
I need somebody whose not in it for the taking
Someone who needs me as long as we will live
Chorus: But I can't, win for losin'
Tired of giving everything sonow I'm giving in
Cause I can't, win for losin'
I don't need no one to break my heart again
There's nothing greater than someone by your side
Under the full moon and stars
But if all they wanna do is cause you pain,
You're better off alone
Without a broken heart
No matter what I do to try to make love stay
I just can't seem to win
I'd climb a mountain and swim across the sea
Just to find my heart in pieces once again
ChorusUnder the skies of old big D
He works a nine to five
Bending steel and driving nails
By phone in a suit and tie
He fights traffic in his Mercedes
To put on his cowboy boots
Then he climbs on board his pick-up truck
And barrels on out of the chute
Dallas days and Fort Worth nights
All day long he sets his sights
On ice cold beer and neon lights
From sky high beams
To bucking machines
He's a single man with a double life
Dallas days and Fort Worth nights
Yeah he's headed honky-tonkin'
To a place they call Cowtown
He's gonna hit the floor hip-hoppin'
Just spinnin' when the sun goes down
He'll buy a drink for a cowgirl
Hopin' to quench her thirst
One that'll take him to heaven
And bring him back down to earth
Dallas days and Fort Worth nights
All day long he sets his sights
On ice cold beer and neon lights
From sky high beams
To bucking machines
He's a single man with a double life
Dallas days and Fort Worth nights
Dallas days and Fort Worth nights
All day long he sets his sights
On ice cold beer and neon lights
From sky high beams
To bucking machines
He's a single man with a double life
Dallas days and Fort Worth nights
All day long he sets his sights
On ice cold beer and neon lights
Dallas days and Fort Worth nights
Dallas days and Fort Worth nightsA light shines from my window
I just can't sleep no more
Lord, it hurts so much to be alone
But the real men never do admit
That it's them that might be wrong
At least that's what he told me in his song
He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didn't miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didn't shed a tear
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind
The freedom that he sings about
I guess I'll never know
I just can't shake the guilt or kill the pain
But he lets me ride when the lights turns low
Get on board the radio and take a ride to Texas on his train
He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didn't miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didn't shed a tear
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kindDid you ever see Dallas from a DC-9 at night?
Well Dallas is a jewel, oh yeah, Dallas is a beautiful sight
And Dallas is a jungle but Dallas gives a beautiful light
Did you ever see Dallas from a DC-9 at night?
Well, Dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you're down
But when you are up, she's the kind you want to take around
But Dallas ain't a woman to help you get your feet on the ground
And Dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you're down
Well, I came into Dallas with the bright lights on my mind,
But I came into Dallas with a dollar and a dime
Well Dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his eyes
A steel and concrete soul with a warm hearted love disguise
A rich man who tends to believe in his own lies
Yeah Dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his eyes
Well, I came into Dallas with the bright lights on my mind,
But I came into Dallas with a dollar and a dime
Did you ever see Dallas from a DC-9 at night?
Well Dallas is a jewel, oh yeah, Dallas is a beautiful sight
And Dallas is a jungle but Dallas gives a beautiful light
Did you ever see Dallas from a DC-9 at night?When the weather's kinda chilly and we start to kiss and hug
Everybody thinks she's silly cause she wants to cuddle bug
That cuddle buggin' baby of mine keeps cuddle buggin' all the time
Honey sweet double treat that cuddle buggin' baby of mine
When we go to see a movie and the lights are way down low
I can tell she'd rather cuddle bug than stay and see the show
That cuddle buggin' baby of mine keeps cuddle buggin' all the time
I repeat ain't she sweet that cuddle buggin' baby of mine
When the band begins to playin' and start to cuddle rug
I can almost share her sayin' let's go home and cuddle bug
That cuddle buggin' baby of mine keeps cuddle buggin' all the time
Turtle dove full of love that cuddle buggin' baby of mine
[ piano ]
Oh I love my little darling and I guess I always will
When it comes to cuddle buggin' I just never get my fill
I love that cuddle buggin' baby of mine keeps cuddle buggin' all the time
Makes this boy jump with joy that cuddle buggin' of mineA lover's first touch and dreams of that night
She'll keep in her heart for the rest of her life
Men tend to forget those little things
We're not as sentimental as we ought to be
There's so much that we don't see
Only a woman understands
The shine in the diamond on her hand
And it's a mystery to every man
How easy tears can flow
And what's so special about a rose
Only a woman knows
Those three little words men find hard to say
Mean so much to her, have you told her today
Love's not a game, but there is a rule
Nothing's for granted and nothin's assumed
But most men don't have a clue
Only a woman understands
The shine in the diamond on her hand
And it's a mystery to every man
How easy tears can flow
And what's so special about a rose
Only a woman knowsFrom what I've seen, you're magnificent
You fight evil with all you do
Your every act is spectacular
It makes me lay here and love you
From what I hear, you are generous
You make sunshine and glory too
When you walk in things go luminous
It makes me lay here and love you
From what I know, you're terrified
You have mistrust running through you
Your smile is hiding something hurtful
It makes me lay here and love you
It makes me lay here and love you
I'm filled with violet and red and blue
I have a feeling from what I do
That you might lay there and love me tooThese four walls of Farnworth
Are closin' in on me
My final meal's over
They're gonna set me free
I can feel the fire's a burnin'
As the devil guards my door
I hit my knees in search of Jesus
On a cold jailhouse floor
Lord, now I'm singin'
"Get me out of here"
I see the preacher's eyes
As my daughter cries
When they strap me in this chair
Lord, I hope she forgives me
For livin' my life this way
Tonight I ride the lightning
To my final judgment day
Every life owes a death
That's what the Bible says
I owe mine to this state
For shootin' that boy to death
A liquor store attendant
He was reachin' for his gun
Now his Momma sits there smilin'
As the boss yells "Roll on one
Now I'm singin'
"Get me out of here"
I see the preacher's eyes
As my daughter cries
And they strap me in this chair
I hope she forgives me
For leavin' her this way
Tonight I ride the lightning
To my final restin' place
A hungry blue eyed baby cryin'
Made me rob that store
An' as that boy lay there dyin'
I dropped my pistol on the floor
Yeah, I'd take it all back but there's nothin' I can do
They've covered my face
An' the order's gone through
As the boss yells "Roll on, two"
Now I'm flyin'
Up an' out of here
I close my eyes an' slowly rise
Let my body leave this chair
Lord I hope you forgive me
For livin' my life this way
Yeah, tonight I ride the lightning
To my final restin' place
These four walls of Farnworth
Are closin' in on meThere's a gonna come a day you're gonna sit and cry
There's a gonna come a day you're gonna sit and cry
When your new love leaves you and wanders far away
Remember what I'm a tellin' you there's a gonna come a day
There's a gonna come a time you're gonna be all alone
There's a gonna come a time you're gonna be all alone
You're gonna reach to touch me but I'll be far away
Remember what I'm a tellin' you there's a gonna come a day
There's a gonna come a day...
[ guitar ]
There's a gonna come a time you're gonna look around
There's a gonna come a time you're gonna look around
You're gonna open your big blue eyes but it's gonna be too late
Remember what I'm a sayin' now there's a gonna come a day
There's a gonna come a day...Here the labor is so hard and the workers they are tired
And our weary hearts're yearning for a rest
And I find we're getting anxious to be in that happy home
Where we'll receive such peace and happiness
But wait a little longer please Jesus there are so many wandering out in sin
Just a little longer please Jesus a few more days to get our loved ones in
Family scattered here and there and thought Lord we love them dear
Maybe we can help them find a way
But if waiting is the cost dear ol' Lord then I'll be lost
And that's the only reason why we say
Wait a little longer please Jesus
A few more days to get our loved ones inTrying not to love you, failing in every way
With you around I keep losing ground day by day
Trying to be fair both to me and to you
Trying not to love you is hard to do
But I guess there's no use hiding
What everybody knows
'Cause to other eyes there's no disguise
For the love that shows
So if I'm not being clear
I'll explain these words to you
Trying not to love you is hard to do
Well, I guess there's no use hiding
What everybody knows
'Cause to other eyes there's no disguise
For the love that shows
So if I'm not being clear, baby
I'll explain these words to you
Trying not to love you is hard to do
Trying not to love you is so hard to doMaybe I could stick my feet in a wishing well
Pocket full of pennies maybe I could get some help
I got a hole in my heart like the holes in my jeans
I try to patch it up with anything and everything
But it ain't workin'
So why do we believe
In every little thing
That rips us at the seams
Woah-oh we're the lucky ones
Woah-oh we're the lucky ones baby
'Cause there's no such thing as chance
Gotta play what's in your hands
Woah-oh we're the lucky ones
Maybe I could bet my love on a four leaf clover
The winter house, then you know it's over
It's cold in my soul like it's cold outside
Cross my heart and hope to find the love that lasts a lifetime
But I ain't there yet
So why do we keep
Giving hearts away
To things that only break
Woah-oh we're the lucky ones
Woah-oh we're the lucky ones baby
Cuz there's no such thing as chance
Gotta play what's in your hands
Woah-oh
Ain't gonna live my life by the roll of the dice, no
Ain't gonna live my life by the roll of the dice
So why do we believe in every little thing that rips us at the seams
Woah-oh we're the lucky ones
Woah-oh we're the lucky ones little baby
Cuz there's no such thing as chance
Ya gotta play what's in your hands
Woah-oh we're the lucky ones
Woah-oh we're the lucky ones
We're the lucky ones baby
Cuz' there's no such thing as chance
Ya gotta play what's in your hands
Woah, woah, no, no, no, no
Cuz there's no such thing as chance
Ya gotta play what's in your hands
Woah, woah, no, no
Yeah, baby
Gotta play what's in your hands
Hey-ya
Little baby
So why, so why, so why do we believe
I said no, no, no
So why, so why, so why do we believe little baby
We're the lucky ones little baby
Little babyWhen I saw you buyin' Cosmo and a Hot Rod magazine
I said to myself now there's a girl for me
And when I asked you to go for a ride
You stole my heart when you said if I can drive
I said how bout some music you said you got any Merle
That's when I knew you were my kind of girl
And when we started talking I could not believe my ears
You said you were a Braves fan even through the rotten years
You quoted William Faulkner and Martin Luther King
You said your favorite movie star would always be James Dean
And when we went to dinner you wore blue jeans with your pearls
That's when I knew you were my kind of girl
You march to the beat of a different drum
The funny thing is that I hear the same one
We both like to color outside of the lines
We're peas in a pod girl we're two of a kind
Yeah you march to the beat of a different drum
I said I think I love you you said what's not to love
I thought about a kiss but I wasn't quick enough
I guess while I was thinkin' you were readin' my mind
Cause you wrapped your arms around me and you pressed your lips to mineO Lord, my God, when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
And when I think of God, His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to take away my sin
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And lead me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow with humble adoration
And then proclaim, my God, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou artThere's a wedding today mine I know a heart that's so gay mine
Just over the hill I know I will be able to see
The old church steeple and all the people waitin' for me
And I know there's a girl mine she's gonna live in this world of mine
We'll say ours vows together to love each other till forever
If there's one happy soul in this world it's mine
[ organ ]
I'm on top of the hill it's mine but something just brought the thrill of mine
I see the old church steeple but something's wrong I see no people
And what's worse I see no girl
Can it be that this girl of mine played the trick on this heart of mine
Not long ago when I met her she stole my heart I can't forget her
It looks like it's gonna be a broken heart mineParody of Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer by Elmo & Patsy (R. Brook), Kris Publishing Co./Elmo Publishing (SESAC)
New lyrics by Cledus T. Judd and Bruce Burch, La-Po Music (BMI)/Bruce Burch Publishing (SESAC)
CHORUS
Grandpa got runned over by a John Deere
Walking home from the Moose Lodge Christmas Eve.
Now you can say there's no such thing as Santa,
But after suing John Deere, I believe...
He'd been a-guzzlin' old Jack Daniels
And smokin' that wacky weed-
He mixed it with his medication
And run off with some bleach-blonde named Bernice.
When we found him Christmas mornin'
We thought he had a heart attack.
But he had tar prints on his forehead
And incriminatin' hickies on his neck.
(ON HIS WHAT???)
CHORUS
But we're all ashamed of Grandpa.
He took Grandma's death too well.
Started watchin' porno movies
And engaging in phone sex with Cousin Belle.
It's a better Christmas without Grandpa
Last year in church, he mooned the choir.
At first, we thought it was Alzheimer's,
But looking back, we realized he was wired.
CHORUS
Yeah, I filed myself a lawsuit
And they awarded me two mil.
You know Grandpa didn't leave me nuthin',
But thanks to that old John Deere, he got killed.
Funny, all my friends and neigh-bras
Turned up on the grand jury,
(laughs) I bribed 'em like Johnny Cochran
Did when they set O.J. Simpson free.
GUIL-TY!!!
CHORUS (x2)Theres a place in Ireland I Know well
Were I spend so many happy times
Were I d sit for hours by the lake side
With my dads old fishing rod and line
And the warm summer evenings by the river
With my true loves hand clasped in mine
Were we made our promises together
That Id be his and hed be mine
Oh take me back to those good old days
Those times not very long ago
Let me relive again those sweet memories
Of my life in my Irish Country home
Now Im far far away from my home lane
Im living many miles across the sea
For I had to go abroad to get employment
Cause at home there was no work for me
But I know I always will remember
Those golden memories of home
And all though Im living ore the water
My heart is in my Irish Country Home
Oh take me back to those good old days
Those times not very long ago
Let me relive again those sweet memories
Of my life in my Irish Country home
Repeat
Yes my Life in my Iris Country homeThey say for every boy and girl,
There's just one love in this old world,
And I, I kn-ow, I, I, I've found mine.
The heavenly touch of your embrace,
Tells me no one will take your place,
A, A, A, A, ever in my heart.
Chorus:
Young love, first love,
Filled with true devotion,
Young love, our love,
We share with deep emotion.
Just one kiss from your sweet lips,
Will tell me that your love is real,
And I, I, I can fe-el that it's true.
We will vow to one another,
There will never be another,
Lo-ve for you, or for me.
Chorus:
Young love, first love,
Filled with true devotion,
Young love, our love,
We share with deep emotion.TALK TO HER HEART
(Bill Anderson - Jim Weatherly - Steve Wariner)
'99 Sony/ATV Songs
RECORDED BY STEVE WARINER
Boys we're living in a brave new world
Let me tell you what I've learned about girls
In this age of high tech and state of the art
When it comes to love you've still gotta talk to her heart
She can have a college degree MBA or a PhD
She can be strong and she can be smart
But when it comes to love you've still got to talk to her heart
You got to be honest you got to be real
You got to tell her how you really do feel
Don't talk about fishin' don't talk about cars
Talk about the moon and talk about the stars
Tell her she's beautiful just talk to her heart
You got to be honest you got to be real...
Well there's been a lot of changes since time began
But nothing's changed between a woman and a man
It's how things were it's how things are
When it comes to love you've still got to talk to her heart
Yeah when it comes to love you've still got to talk to herThere's a place on the yukon river, called the carriboux saloon.
Where the miners go, to spend their gold,
An' listen to the sad, sweet tune.
Feast their eyes' upon the beauty of the lovely yukon rose,
They can look but they better not touch her, she belongs to pierre
Leboux.
They say he found down in seattle, won her at a young and tender age.
Now she sings up here, while the men drink beer,
Like a bird in a guilded cage.
Well, one time a man from tulsa challenged pierre for her rose's hand,
Now he lies below the the bitter snow in this wild and savage land.
Some nights when the northern lights are shinin'
And the cold north wind is howlin' across the snow.
Is it just the wind that you hear sighin'...or could it be the sound of
The yukon rose.
Then one night a bigfoot just happened to be passin' by.
And there in the dark his heart his lonely heart,
Was touched by rose's lulaby.
So he walked into the bar room and every one turned to stare,
But he looked to them just like a bearded man, in a coat of grizzly
Hair.
Bigfoot saw the yukon rose and their eyes meet through the gloom.
An' she was hypnotized by his gentle eyes, and was drawn across the
Room.
Now they say that love has no bounderies, an' I reckon that it's right,
'Cause beauty and the savage beast, fell in love that night.
Some nights when the northern lights are shinin',
An' the cold north winds are howlin' 'cross the snow,
Is it just the wind that you hear sighin'...
Or could it be the song of the yukon rose...
Now pierre was in the back room, dealin' cards when the music stoped.
He laid his hand down and looked around, and said nobody touch that pot.
He walked out to the bar room and the trouble began,
An' his blood ran cold when he saw the rose, in the arms of the tall
Strange man.
Pierre walked up and he grabbed her, an' shoved her t'wards the stage,
And the gentle look in the strangers eyes, turned wild and red with
Rage.
An' then with just one mighty blow, pierre lay on the saw-dust floor.
The tall strange man, took the ladies hand, an' walked out through the
Door.
No one dared to follow, and where he took her no one knows,
But we all jumped back, when we saw the tracks. of bigfoot in the snow.
Some say she probably died that winter, she must have I s'pose.
But just last night under the northern lights,
I heard the song of the yukon rose.
Some nights when the northern lights are shinin',
And the cold north wind is howlin' across the snow,
Is it just the wind that you hear sighin'
Or could it be the song of the yukon roseI walk up to my door and hate to turn the key emptiness is all that waits inside for me
That's how it is when the one you love is gone
That's how it is when your house is not a home
I look around and see things marked with his and hers
Things like these just seem to make it that much worse
That's how it is since I live my life alone that's how it is since my house is not a home
Is there a way out for a soul so torn as mine
Each day I live I'm like a prisoner servin' time
That's how it is ask anyone who lives alone
That's how it is when your house is not a home
That's how it is since my house is not a homeSome say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed.
Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you, it's only seed.
It's a heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's a dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance.
It's the one who won't be taken
Who can not seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live.
When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong.
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In spring becomes the rose...The sky is falling down around me
This kind of storm just might drown me
If I let it
It's hard to look on the bright side
When you've been blind-sided by
Something you never saw coming
That worst thing you could imagine
I believe in God even when He's silent
I believe in the sun even when it isn't shining
I believe in good luck even when the dealer don't deal it
I believe in love, I believe in love
Even when I can't feel it
Bad things happen to good people
Without any rhyme or reason, it just happens
There's nothing fair about it
But what can I do about it?
Tomorrow's another day
Good or bad, either way
I believe in God even when He's silent
I believe in the sun even when it isn't shining
I believe in good luck even when the dealer don't deal it
I believe in love, I believe in love
Even when I can't feel itPeople say she's only in my head
It's gonna take time but I'll forget
They say I need to get on with my life
But they don't realize
Is when your dialing six numbers just to hang up the phone.
Driving cross town just to see if she's home.
Waking a friend in the dead of night, just to hear 'em say it's gonna be alright.
When your finding things to do not to fall asleep
'Cause you know she'll be there in your dreams.
That's when she's
More than a memory
Took a match to everything she ever wrote
Watched her words go up in smoke
Tore all the pictures off the wall
But that ain't helping me at all.
'Cause when your talking out loud and nobody's there
You look like hell and you just don't care
Drinking more than you've ever drank
Sinking down lower than you've ever sank
When you find yourself falling down upon your knees,
Praying to God, begging him please
That's when she's
More than a memory
She's more
She's more
'Cause when your dialing her number just to hang up the phone
Driving cross town just to see if she's home
Waking a friend in the dead of night, just to hear 'em say it's gonna be alright
When our finding things to do not to fall asleep
'Cause you know she'll be waiting in your dreams
That's when she's
More than a memory
People say she's only in my head
Its gonna take time but I'll forget(C.W. McCall, Bill Fries, Chip Davis)

I'm tired of having fun just loving anyone
Not more and good be holding hands with me when midnight comes
It may seem all right then but when it's said and done
This old heart of mine is right back where it started from
I want a lasting love no more goodbye love
I'm through with temporary love that's undependable
Goodbye to yesterdays hello to better days
I want a lasting love that's guarantee to stay
I've truly had my share of insincere affair
Yet that's same old emptiness inside it's always there
I'm glad I've finally seen a change just had to be
Here today and gone tomorrow love is not for me
I want a lasting love...
I want a lasting love that's guarantee to staySweet little Jesus boy
They made you be born in a manger
Sweet little holy child
Didn't know who you was
Didn't know you'd come to save us Lord
To take our sins away
Our eyes was blind we couldn't see
We didn't know who you was
Long time ago you was born
Born in a manger low
Sweet little Jesus boy
The world treat you mean Lord
Treat me mean too
But that's how things is down here
We didn't know twas you
You done told us how
We is a'tryin'
Master you done showed us how
Even when you's dyin
Just seem like we can't do right
Look how we treated you
But please sir, forgive us Lord
We didn't know twas you
Sweet little Jesus boy born long time ago
Sweet little holy child and we didn't know who you wasOn that very first day, the Lord sat down
And saw fit to say let there be light
So He can tell the daytime from the night
And then He spoke again, we felt the wind
Come rolling in, smelt the rain
And soaked everything
And then the mountains rose up
Across the great planes
And all the angels up in Heaven started singing
All it's missing is pretty thing
Let there be cowgirls for every cowboy
Make 'em strong as any man
Something you can't tame, she's a Mustang
A heart beat, the harder I am
She's got a drawl y'all
She's the salt of the earth that rocks my world
Let there be cowgirls, come on
He met me back in sixty-eight
The first time I met her I was nearly eight and she was ten
Her name was little Kayleigh
She was born to a farmer who was friends with my father
I was in love with her, she had croppers on a dollar
Thought I was in, it made me think again
But when I turned sixteen
I thought it couldn't get worse
I saw her riding on a horse and fell in love so bad it hurt
Let there be cowgirls for every cowboy
Make 'em strong as any man
Something you can't tame, she's a Mustang
A heart beat, the harder I am
She's got a drawl y'all
She's the salt of the earth and rocks my world
Let there be cowgirls, ooh, come on
Ooh, let there be cowgirls
Ooh, let there be cowgirls
Let there be cowgirls for every cowboy
Make 'em strong as any man
Something you can't tame, she's a Mustang
A heart beat, the harder I am
She's got a drawl y'all
She's the salt of the earth and rocks my world
Let there be cowgirls
Ooh, let there be cowgirls, come onPickin' up the pieces of my heart
Love to you is nothing but a fashion that stays in style util you change your mind
And when you think it's time to try a new love
You go and leave my broken heart behind
You've got me pickin' up the pieces I've been pickin' up the pieces
I'm just pickin' up the pieces of my broken heart
You've got me pickin' up the pieces I've been pickin' up the pieces
I'm just pickin' up the pieces of my heart
[ piano ]
Every time you leave me I start crying counting every minute we're apart
If you could only have consideration then I wouldn't have this broken heart
You've got me pickin' up...Little foot, little foot
Where you wanna go?
Is your boyfriend in the sticks?
Are you on your way home?
Little foot, little foot
How you gonna feel?
Is it really real?
Is it really real?
Love's no good, you know it's true
I say it all the time
Sometimes he's in love with you
But maybe he'll be mine
Just kidding
I wouldn't do it to you
No way, no way
Little foot, little foot
Where you going out?
Oh, you're always going out
Yeah, you're always going out
Little foot, little foot
How you gonna feel?
When you drink another beer
Yeah, you drink a lot of beer
Love's no good and nothing's free
It's sad, I know, but true
Sometimes he's in love with me
But maybe he wants you
Just kidding
You wouldn't do it to me
No way, no way, no way
Little foot, little foot
Where you wanna go?
Oh, your boyfriend
Florida
Little foot, little foot
How you gonna feel?
Is it really real?
Is it really real?
Are you really real?
Am I really real?
Are we really real?
Is it really real?They wake up in the morning
And they drink their coffee black
They love their women
One beat shy of a heart attack
On the way to work
They might stop by a fishin' hole
That's how country boys roll
Yeah, they work, work, work
All week 'til the job gets done
Weekends they barbecue
And have a cold one
They run on a big old hog
And a pinch of Skoal
That's how country boys roll
Yeah, they're spinnin' their wheels
Castin' their reels
Way back on them old county roads
Singin' in bars
Soupin' up cars
Just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and a glove
To them fallin' in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll
Well if you don't know your way around
They'll draw you a map
And if you're broke and you ask
They'll give you the shirt off their back
All they need is a little gas
A few dollars to fold
That's how country boys roll
Yeah, they're spinning their wheels
Castin' their reels
Way back on them old county roads
Singin' in bars
Soupin' up cars
Just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and a glove
To them fallin' in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll
Ah, come on
Yeah, they're cryin' and loud
Humble and proud
They love mama and Jesus and Jones
That's how country boys roll
Don't you know
Yeah, that's how country boys rollBeside the cottonfield I was born underneath the tree was my home
A flock of geese flew overhead
Wind from the wings fall down to me come go with us that's my way
It grieves me much to see you cry I'll break a heart with my goodbye
I warned you ahead of time
I could never say I'm sorry but it has to be that's my way
That's my way to try to find a place I've never been
Before directions master me and distance is my friend
I try to put a lifetime into each and every day that's my way
I yearn to love but it can't be for fear of what's inside of me
With the each day setting of the sun
A passin' train stirs my soul like winds of long ago that's my way
That's my way that's my way that's my wayLove is no excuse for what we're doing
For we both know that two hearts could break
We tell ourselves we've got to have each other but love is no excuse for us to make
Sure we love each other and it could be so right
But not if someone else has got to pay
Our love for each other looks good in the night
But our love can never see the light of day
It's been going on for much too long now and our wrongs have mounted one by one
We tell ourselves that's cause we love each other
But love is no excuse for what we've done
Sure we love each other...I've been out here seven dances in a row
Yeah the band's so hot they won't play nothin' slow
Stetsons and Wrangler jeans are floodin' through the door
And it's sink or swim as soon as you hit the floor
[Chorus]
I'm dancin' in a sea of cowboy hats
Shoulder to shoulder and back to back
Two steppin' fools as far as the eye can see
They're ridin' the wave on that sawdust floor
Rockin' the boat from shore to shore
So jump right in cause this is where it's at in the sea of cowboy hats
Feel free to scrape your boots til they've worn holes
You won't get too far in here with rubber soles
Yeah the place is packed and we're puttin' on a show
In over our heads and caught up in the flow
[Chorus:Repeat x2]Girl, you are a bird that flies away
As I'm reaching out to take you in my hand
At first, I believe your gonna stay
And I think I under stand
You have shown me all your colors
Long enough to feel the pain
Then you leave me helpless
Like a candle n the rain
[ ]
Girl, you are a wind that's blowing free
And you leave the dust of wanting in my eyes
Faith, I thought you were here for me
Just to clear my cloudy skies
You are moving here within me
long enough to feel the pain
Then you leave me stranded
Like a candle in the rain
I don't think I will ever heal
From the scars you left on me
How can one hold on so long
And let go so easilyIf I was runnin' this country
I'd start it over from scratch
Keep what's good, pile up what's bad
And then I'd strike the match
Yeah, we'd go back to the basics
Of how things ought to be
Yeah, there'd be a lot of changes
If it was left up to me
[Chorus]
Cause what this country needs
Is a little more steel guitar
And put a litte fiddle right in the middle
Straight out of a texas bar
And give us a song, we can all sing along
From sea to shining sea
Be proud of it and always love it
That's what this country needs
Now if you want to hear about livin'
Just twist that radio dial
Til you come to a singer singin'
What life is all about
Cause you can't deny that people still cry
They laugh and they smile and they hurt
And that's my humble opinion why'all
You can take it for what it's worth
[Chorus]
Yeah, turn it on up and let it ring out
Across the land of the free
They ought to build a statue of hand Williams, Sr.
In Washington, D.C.
[Chorus]
You just be proud of it and always love it
And that's what this country needs.When I get my hands on you,
I'm gonna do every little everything, anything girl

We'll let tonight turn tomorrow back into the night,
I'm gonna make you go crazy baby,
when I get my hands on you,
ain't nothin' in the world gonna slow me down
I've been waitin' on this for such a long, long time

(Bob Merrill - Terry Shand)
Â« Â© '50 Joy Music Â»
You don't have to be a baby to cry
All you need is for love to go wrong
You don't have to be a baby to cry
Or to lay awake the whole night long
When you leave me my golden rainbow disappears
And you leave me a broken heart full of tears
These ain't raindrops in my eyes what should I lie
You don't have to be a baby to cry
When you leave me my golden rainbow disappears
And you leave me a broken heart full of tears
These ain't raindrops in my eyes what should I lie
You don't have to be a baby to cryAll the good times are past and gone all the good times are past and gone
All the good times are past and gone what's left for a poor boy to do
I can still see my mama bend over that ol' washpot
And it's so doggone cold you could nearly freeze on the spot
My pa eatin' them flapjacks and yellin' for more
And the kids makin' tracks across mama's clean floor
But all them good times are past and gone now all the good times are gone
Well you could look for miles down a winding railroad track
And see train a leavin' and hear one comin' back
And with a cloud of blue up over your head
It's like something from a storybook that you once read
But all them good times are past and gone now all the good times are gone
All the good times are past and gone what's left for a poor boy to do
And go down on that river when the big boats make their run
And the cane poles grow so thick they block up the sun
Just smell that coffee boilin' in an old tin can
And that hot grease poppin' in the fryin' pan
But all them good times are past and gone now all them good times are gone
All the good times are past and gone what's left for a poor boy to doI've been lonesome,
I've been empty
I got an achin',
Way down inside
I need someone,
Someone to hold me
Pull down the shade,
Turn out the light
And love me tonight.
Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door.
I need you so now
Come on let's go now
Kick off your shoes,
Turn out the light
And love me tonight.
Now don't you worry
We're all alone now
Let your hair down
Sit by my side
Turn off the T.V.
Put on some music
Pull down the shade
Turn out the light
And love me tonight
Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door.
I need you so now
Come on let go now
Kick off your shoes
Turn out the light
And love me tonightThere's a guy at the door wearing black eyeliner
There's a birthday girl goin' for an all-nighter
And the frat boys knockin' back shots with the bikers
Just another night with a buncha outsiders, yeah
All the neon signs lighting up our faces
Grab another round, add another for the waitress
The kick drum kicks in loud and our song's comin'
Through the speakers thumpin' all night long
All night long

And left me sitting here alone all by myself
I thought you were over him but I was wrong
My world stopped but the band keeps playin' on
They just keep playin' they don't notice you were gone
You walked right out on me while they played our favorite song
And before you reached the door my teardrops hit the floor
My world stopped but the band keeps playin' on
[ steel - fiddle ]
Well you said you'd forgotten him and no more did you care
But when we walked in your eyes lit up as you saw him sitting there
Well he asked you to dance and just like that you were gone
And my world stopped but the band keeps playin' on
They just keep playin'..If I were a carpenter and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway would you have my baby
If a thinker was my trade would you still find me
Carrying the pots I made following behind me
Save my love through loneliness save my love through sorrow
I've given you my ownliness come and give me your tomorrow
[ ac.guitar ]
If I worked my hands in wood would you still love me
Answer babe yes I would I would put you above me
If I were a miller at a mill wheel grinding
Would you see it and know my face I'm here for the finding
Now if I were a carpenter and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway would you have my baby
Would you marry me anyway would you have my babyI no longer notice if you're wearing perfume I quit smoking girl you never even knew
And the road is full of young and restless people and they pull off the energy to move
It's the habit for us to stay together we said and watched the nightly shadows grow
Every day last year I left for California this is my year for Mexico
We used to whisper low across the night time now we never whisper nor we call
Our love was left upon the shelf from winter where the sunlight never touches it at all
It's the habit for us...
Your back is turned to me while you are reading
I close my eyes while I pretend to toe
From the road I hear the sound of passing traffic some of them are bound for Mexico
It's the habit for us...
This is my year for MexicoWell it looks like you finally made the front page
You always did look good in white
And I hope you like the ring of your new name
The one you'll be given tonight
All of this is news to me
I wondered why you never called
I guess that's the way that it's meant to be
If you're gonna ride you gotta learn to fall
But where do I fit in the picture
Or do I really fit at all
Or have I become a fixture
On an old forgotten wall
Well it looks like I finally made the front page
You know you always said I would
And things are well here in room twenty eight
God I hope you're doing good
There's a picture in my wallet
That I look at sometimes
It sends chills through my bones
A long lost love, or whatever you want to call it
Oh, but it left me all alone
But where do I fit in the picture
Or do I really fit at all
Or have I become a fixture
On an old forgotten wall
On an old forgotten wallNo affection were the words that stuck on my mind
When she walked out on me for the very last time
Oh mamma sweet mamma can you tell me what to say
I don`t know what I've done to be treated this way
In a cold dirty room that's where I found myself
With a bottle of wine and some pills off the shelf
Oh mamma sweet mamma can you tell me what to say
I don't know what I've done and I`m feeling so ashamed
Then an angel appeared she was just 17
In a dirty old gown with a conscious so clean
Oh mamma sweet mamma can you tell me what to say
She's brought back the life that I once threw away
She's brought back the life that I once threw awayI dance every time you pull the string I cry every time you treat me mean
I lie when I say we're only friends I know I'm right in the palm of your hand
In the palm of your hand that's where you've got me
Yes loving you is messin' up my mind
But try yes I may I just can't stop me you've got me right in the palm of your hand
I laugh every time you have a fling I hurt every time you cause a scene
I lie when I say we've reached the end I know I'm right in the palm of your hand
In the palm of your handDidn't work out, did it?
You'll have to admit it
It wasn't so easy, was it?
Didn't work out, did it?
You thought love had made me blind
You could do just as you please
But just like a great big ol' neon sign
I could see you were cheatin' on me
Didn't work out, did it?
You'll have to admit it
It wasn't so easy, was it?
Didn't work out, did it?
Didn't work out, did it?
You'll have to admit it
It wasn't so easy, was it?
Didn't work out, did it?
So go on and do what you want to
This time I'm ready for anything
Well, I don't care much what you do
I'm gonna go on and laugh and sing
Didn't work out, did it?
You'll have to admit it
It wasn't so easy, was it?
It didn't work out, did it?I was just out of the service thumbing through the classifieds
When an ad that said:"Old Chevy" somehow caught my eye
The lady didn't know the year,or even if it ran
But I had that thousand dollars in my hand
It was way back in the corner of this old ramshackle barn
Thirty years of dust and dirt on that green army tarp
When I pulled the cover off,it took away my breath
What she called a Chevy was a sixty six Corvette
I felt a little guilty as I counted out the bills
But what a thrill I got when I sat behind the wheel
I opened up the glove box and that's when I found the note
The date was nineteen-sixty six and this is what it wrote:
He said,"My name is Private Andrew Malone"
"If you're reading this,then I didn't make it home"
"But for every dream that shattered,another one comes true"
"This car was once a dream of mine,now it belongs to you"
"And though you may take her and make her your own"
"You'll always be riding with Private Malone"
Well it didn't take me long at all,I had her running good
I love to hear those horses thunder underneath her hood
I had her shining lika a diamond and I'd put the rag top down
All the pretty girls would stop and stare as I drove her through town
The buttons on the radio didn't seem to work quite right
But it picked up that oldie show,especially late at night
I'd get the feeling sometimes,if I turned real quick I'd see
A soldier riding shotgun in the seat right next to me
It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that's shattered,another one comes true
This car was once a dream of his,back when it was new
He told me to take her and make her my own
And I was proud to be riding with Private Malone
One night it was raining hard,I took the curve too fast
I still dont remember much about that fiery crash
Someone said they thought they saw a soldier pull me out
They didn't get his name, but I know without a doubt
It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that's shattered,another one comes true
This car was once a dream of his,back when it was new
I know I wouldn't be here if he hadn't tagged along
That night I was riding with Private Malone
Oh,thank God,I was riding with Private MaloneI've seen more than a Little Texas, and a Playboy always knows
A man does what he Wills as long as he stays on his toes
He can Russell up a fortune, any man could strike it Rich
But I'm doing good to keep it Strait and keep my wheels out of the ditch
Ain't no Foster for the Desert Rose, the babblin' Brooks are Dunn
That Crystal ball won't even book me one day in the Sun
I'm Haggard, worn and Waylon from the bottom of my Restless Heart
Don't know Wy the Black cloud's tailin' me, there seems to be no Parton from the dark
And I've had it to the Gills of knowin' what the Nitty Gritty's all about
Bein' McEntired and Loveless I can't Lovett if I'm all Tuckered out
Well, I never meant to set out like a half-cocked Gatlin gun
No highway Head Hunter's gonna let this Rabbitt run
I ain't Raven 'bout The Ride, I probably got no fate to Seal
If I can't roll through Alabama half Asleepin' At The Wheel
All my Paycheckes are like dried up Wells and way too small to Cash
Or I'd find a roadside motel, lay some money down to Crash
I'm Haggard, worn and Waylon from the bottom of my Restless Heart
Don't know Wy the Black cloud's tailin' me, there seems to be no Parton from the dark
And I've had it to the Gills of knowin' what the Nitty Gritty's all about
Bein' McEntired and Loveless I can't Lovett if I'm all Tuckered outI am a poor (just a poor) wayfaring stranger (wayfaring stranger)
Wandering through this world of woe
But there's no sorrow (there's no sorrow) toil nor danger (toil nor danger)
In that bright land to which I go
I'm going home to see my father I'm going home no more to roam
I'm just a going over Jordan I'm only going over home
I'm going home to see my mother I'm going home no more to roam
I'm just a going over Jordan I'm only going over home
Over home (going home)He's dating a lawyer with a gentle nature
Says she ain't nothing like me
And there's fire and there's water and all I can offer
Is a temperament that he don't need
Well he's making his rounds with the well bred in town
Safe and out of harm
Well he can say what he likes water is nice
But it's fire that keeps you warm
[Chorus]
Maybe I'm rough around the edges
And stubborn to a fault
Maybe I'm just a little too hard headed
Stiff backbone and all
Maybe I'm passionate about being passionate
Say what you like boy water is nice
But it's the fire that keeps you warm
Well if you know me you know it's true
And you can quote me if you want to
[Chorus]Some say it's destiny
Whether triumph or tragedy
But I believe we cast our nets out on the sea
And nothing we gather
Comes for free
I would have paid down through the years
A price beyond rubies beyond tears
To keep you safe with me
But your suspicion and your fear
Your vow to let nobody near was your trinity
Such a tragedy
I drew the best hand you'd ever hold
Then cashed my winnings in long ago
Settled for silver how could I know
You were waiting with the gold
I could have caused your heart to yield
But I was only a disturbance in the field
Of your dreams
And I will never see you cry
You won't be with me when I die
A waste of you and me
A tragedy
We took the wrong train to
Kingdom come now
No more damage
Can be done baby
It's just what the world don't need
It's another stinkin' tragedy
That's how the story goes
Our chapter's coming to a close
We are history
But I will always think of you
Every day until my days are through
You made me believe
In tragedyHere comes the rain, baby
Guess it's goodbye again, baby
For a while it was fun we could walk in the sun
But you never could stand the rain, could you, baby?
See the rain in my eyes, baby
I never could stand goodbyes, baby
For a while you were mine but the sun can't always shine
And you never could stand the rain, could you, baby?
Here comes the rain, baby
Guess it's goodbye again, baby
For a while it was fun we could walk in the sun
But you never could stand the rain, could you, baby?
For a while you were mine but the sun can't always shine
And you never could stand the rain, could you, baby?There's gotta be some changes made round here
I can't go on like this and that's for sure
Yes I've gotta know is it stop is it go should I leave or stay am I just in your way
There's gotta be some changes made round here
There's gotta be some changes made round here
For I can't stand another lonely night of fear
Don't be so unkind I'm almost out of my mind do I fit in your plans
Please tell me where I stay there's gotta be some changes made round here
[ ac.guitar ]
Yes I've gotta know...
There's gotta be some changes made round hereWe'd get up before sun-up to get the work done up
We'd work in the fields till the sun had gone down
We've stood and we've cried as we have bristly watched
A hailstorm a' beatin' our crops to the ground
We've gone to bed hungry many nights in the past
In the good old days when times were bad
Chorus:
No amount of money could buy from me
The memories that I have of then
No amount of money could pay me
To go back and live through it again
I've seen daddy's hands break open and bleed
And I've seen him work till he's stiff as a board
An' I've seen momma layin' in suffer and sickness
In need of a doctor we couldn't afford
Anything at all was more than we had
In the good old days when times were bad
We've got up before and found ice on the floor
Where the wind would blow snow through the cracks in the wall
And I couldn't enjoy then, havin' a boyfriend
I had nothing decent to wear at all
So I long for a love that I never had
In the good old days when times were bad
Repeat chorus
Tag:
In the good old days when times were bad
In the good old days when times were badTwo little children a boy and a girl
Sat by an old church door
The little girl's feet
Were as brown as the curl
That fell on the dress that she wore
The little boy's cloths were all tattered and torn
They shown beneath his blue eyes
Why don't you go home
To you mommy I said
And this was the maddens reply
Mommy's in heaven
Angels took her away
Left Tim and I all alone
We've no one to love us
And daddy is dead
And our darling mother is gone
Mommy got sick
Angels took her away
To dwell in those mansions so bright
She said she would come
For her children some day
And I guess she's coming tonight
The sexton came early
To ring the church bell
And found them
Beneath the snow white
The angels made room for the orphans to dwell
Up in heaven with their mommy that nightIm Driving Too Slow Or Youre Going Too Fast
Im Afraid I Cant Catch Up With You,
Im On My Hands And Knees And Im Begging For Food
Picking Up The Crumbs That Are Left Of You,
As You Set Out To See And Youre Sailing Away
Into The Silence Of Things You Wont Say...
Youre My World But Im On The Moon
Trying To Find A Way To Get Back To You
Youre The Butterfly Im The Prisoner
Youre The Screamer, I Just Whisper,
Im On Fire But All You See Is Ash
Dont You Remember Our Passionate Past,
You Still Take My Breath Away But Now I Cant Breathe
cause You Dont, You Wont Share It With Me...
Youre My World But Im On The Moon
Trying To Find A Way To Get Back To You
Im Beside Myself Youre Inside You
Our Rainbow Is Turning To Black And Blue,
Even Your Cheap Cigars And Your Red Wine
Cant Hide The Darkness Beneath The Sunshine,
And Youre Poisoning Me With Your Sweet Cologne
You Are Everywhere And Im All Alone
Youre My World But Im On The Moon
Trying To Find A Way To Get Back To You
Youre My World But Im On The Moon
Trying To Find A Way To Get Back To You
[instrumental]
Youre My World But Im On The Moon
Trying To Find A Way To Get Back To You
Youre My World But Im On The Moon
Trying To Find A Way To Get Back To You
Youre My... World...
Youre My... World...
Im On The Moon...
Im On The Moon...
Im On The Moon....
Im On The Moon..........I could sit at home another Saturday
And channel surf my life away
Gonna grab my keys,
Get behind the wheel
Got no where to go,
Just like the way it feels
'cause life is short
And the road is long
I'll be punchin' dials
Lookin' for a drivin' song
Ain't gonna stop for nothing
But a tank of gas
Take an old black road
That ain't on the map
Gotta little hula dancer
Bobbin' in my back window
She's gonna stick with me
Wherever I go
'cause life is short
And the road is long
I'll be punchin' dials
Lookin' for a drivin' song
The hours and the songs
And the miles fly by
Got all I need to clear my mind
Turn My headlights off
And crank the tunes
The only light that I need
Is that big full moon
And I know that soon
This night will end
We'll have to head back home
But I'll worry about that then
'cause life is short
And the road is long
I'll be punchin' dials
Lookin' for a drivin' songI wanna run away
Don't come out looking 'round
Too busy dealing with it on my own
He's right behind me
Please God I can't be found
Don't cast another stone
Feel out the night, until the sunrise
The city tells me not to go 'til dawn
And if he wakes that's when my heart breaks
And I'm as good as gone
How do I lie awake now
When I know I've got to be moving on
How do I lie awake now
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong
And in the end
Will we make our amends
Just like we're face to face another dawn
And in the light, or when the moon shines
Will you take me on home?
How do I lie awake now
When I know I've got to be moving on
How do I lie awake now
When nothing's right and nothing's wrongHigh on a hilltop overlooking a city
I watched the bright lights as they gleam
For somewhere you're dancing in some dingy bar room
And the lure of the gay life takes the place of our dream
High on a hilltop my heart cries, Oh Lord
Forgive her she knows not the way
And give me the power to believe and some day
High on a hilltop together we'll pray
I can vision a rounder with a line so smooth
With a promise of riches for you
But you see not the danger for you're silly with booze
And from high on a hilltop I see the devil in you
High on a hilltop my heart cries, Oh Lord
Forgive her she knows not the way
Just give me the power to believe and some day
High on a hilltop together we'll prayThe only joint my mother burned was on the rural route
She sparked in old man tater's woods so she wouldn't be found out
Turned off the dome light and snuck off by herself
Crashed down beneath that window, fired it up, and gave it hell
At that hangout my daddy used to hang around
We watched it all go up in smoke until it all came down
Just like after tabs and stooge and tables got turned
To the only joint my momma ever burned
Just like someone flipped a switch, dad started coming home
No more eating late cause supper's with that tater gone
I had my suspicions, til the night when we said grace
Dad said, "Forgive us, our transgressions as I lit up momma's face."
At that hangout my daddy used to hang around
We watched it all go up in smoke until it all came down
Just like after tabs and stooge and tables got turned
To the only joint my momma ever burned
Lot of small town gonna find some bloodhounds in this town
I'm the only one who ever found out was dad
At that hangout my daddy used to hang around
We watched it all go up in smoke until it all came down
Just like after tabs and stooge and tables got turned
To the only joint my momma ever burnedThink I'll grab a bottle of Patron
When I get off work on my way home
Fill that hot tub full of bubble bath, kick back, relax
Baby you and me and nothing on yea
Got a weekend coming just in time
We're both needing what I've got in mind
What I got in mind, that's me and you into me and you
Can't wait to get you all alone yea
Lay low, stay home and stay high
Stay up, make love, all night
I wanna run my fingers over every single inch of you
Take my time, taking it slow
Stay home, stay high and lay low
We'll let our kisses do the talking girl
Take each other to another world
Feel like we're a million miles from here
Somewhere out there, without going anywhere at all
Lay low, stay home and stay high, yea
Stay up, make love, all night
I wanna run my fingers over every single inch of you
Take my time, taking it slow
Stay home, stay high and
Lay low, stay home and stay high, yea
Stay up, make love, all night
I wanna run my fingers over every single inch of you
Take my time, taking it slow
Stay home, stay high and lay low
Stay home, stay high and lay lowWhen I was a traveler
I used to love to watch the rain
I'd stand under the downspout
Let the water cool my brain
I never thought to worry
If the river rose too high
That all the seeds we planted
Would get washed out with the tide
But now I am a man
And I need a place to hide
But there's nowhere to run
And there's no place to hide
Where the water runs free
And the mud starts to slide
When I was a young man
I could work through wind and rain
I never thought to worry
Had no reason to complain
I thought that I was standin'
On a rock so firm and strong
But it was easy then to see
Just what was right and what was wrong
But now I am a man
I won't be hangin' 'round too long
When I was a child
I used to love to watch the rain
I'd stand under the downspout
Let the water cool my brain
I never thought to worry
If the river rose too high
And all the dreams we planted
Would get washed out with the tide
But there's nowhere to run
And there's no place to hide
Where the water runs free
And the mud starts to slide
Where the water runs free
And the mud starts to slideAre you mine all life through will you kiss me when I'm blue
Will you whisper I love you and make all my dreams come true
Will you share the good and bad bring me joy when I am sad
Tell me darling are you mine and only mine
Are you mine (yes I am) all the time (yes I am)
Mine alone (yes sirree) all my own (all your own)
No one else will ever do I'll be yours and I'll be true
Don't worry dear have no fear cause I'm yours
Are you mine tell me dear will I always have you near
Will the love light always shine in your heart just like in mine
Will you give as well as take keep the vows that you will make
Tell me darling are you mine and only mine
Are you mine (yes I am) all the time (oh yes I am)
Mine alone (you're only one) all my own (absolutely)
No one else will ever do
Are you mine rich or poor tell me darling are you sure
Will you whisper yes I do and forever love me true
Will you honor and obey will you promise not to stray
Tell me darling are you mine and only mine
Are you mine (yes I am)
Don't worry dear have no fear cause I'm yours(Dolly Parton)
The man I loved ran a salesman route
Selling goods from house to house
Now I knew my mama would never stand
For me stepping out with no traveling man
Mama bought things that he was a'selling
But mama didn't know and I sure wasn't telling
That behind her back I was making plans
To meet somewhere with that traveling man
Oh the traveling man was a good bit older
But a girl needs arms to hold her
Mama didn't know 'cause I didn't told her
But mama wouldn't understand
Me stepping out with a traveling man
Mama didn't allow me a'going courting
And I'd tell lies that I reckon I oughtn't
Oh but she'd a'give me the back a' her hand
If she'd a'seen me with that traveling man
So I tell my mama that I reckon I oughta
Go to the spring and fetch us some water
What mama didn't know is I had a plan
To meet down there with that traveling man
Now I make plans to run away
With that traveling man on a Saturday
Well Saturday's here and here I stand
And there goes my mama with that traveling man
Oh that traveling man was a two-time lover
He took my love then he took my mother
But I didn't know 'cause mama didn't told me and I don't understand
My mama running off with my traveling man
Mama, you know you oughtn't a'done that
You just like my daddy
He run off before I ever knowed him
You done run-off with my traveling man
And I really don't think I ever knowed you either
Oh there goes my mama with my traveling man
And I'm really gonna miss that traveling man
Mm-hmDid you ever lie and listen to the rain fall did you ever own a homemade apple pie
Did you ever watch a child while he was praying
Friend don't let the good life pass you by
Did you ever hold a hand to stop its trembling
Did you ever watch the sun desert the sky
Did you ever hold a woman while she's sleeping
Friend don't let the good life pass you by
Man was made for loving not for buying go can't give you things we really need
Just look my friend there's happiness in living
Somewhere between broke and being free
Did you ever see the funny side of losing did you ever sit right down and have a cry
Did you ever take the time to help your neighbor
Just don't let the good life pass you by
Man was made for loving
Just don't let the good life pass you byClean shirt, new shoes
And I don't know where I am goin' to
Silk suit, black tie
I don't need a reason why
They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man
Gold watch, diamond ring
I ain't missin' not a single thing
And cufflinks, stick pin
When I step out I'm gonna do you in
They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man
Top coat, top hat
I don't worry 'cause my wallet's fat
Black shades, white gloves
Lookin' sharp and lookin' for love
They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl grazy 'bout a sharp dressed man(Praise the Lord, I saw the light)
I wandered so aimless, life filled sin
I wouldn't let my dear saviour in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
Just like a blind man I wandered along
Worries and fears I claimed for my home
Then like a blind man God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
I was a fool to wander and stray
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now, I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now, I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now, I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
Praise the Lord, I saw the lightI've got this friend
I don't think you know him
He's not much for words
He's hid in his hardened way
Oh I've got this friend
A loveless romantic
All that he really wants
Is someone to want him back
Oh, if the right one came
If the right one came along
Oh, If the right one came, along
I've got this friend
I don't think you know her
She sings a simple song
It sounds a lot like his
Oh I've got this friend
Holding onto her heart
Like it's a little secret
Like it's all she's got to give
Oh, if the right one came
If the right one came along
Oh, if the right one came, along
It'd be such a shame
(If they never meet)
She sounds lovely
(He sounds right out of a dream)
If only
(If only)
If only
Oh
Oh, if the right one came
If the right one came along
Oh, (I've got this friend) if the right one came
If the right one came along
Oh, (I've got this friend)
If the right one came, alongGood morning sun you've been a long time shinin'
There were times I thought you'd never shine again
Goodbye rain I thought you'd never stop fallin'
But like my tears you left the day that love walked in
Hello world it's good to see that you're still turnin'
Cause yesterday I'd swear I saw you end
And heart it sure is good to feel you burnin'
Cause heart you sure were cold till love walked in
Love walked in and two hearts came together
And now that you're here by my side I know that I'll be satisfied
Forever hand in hand we'll walk together
And when we're old we'll both remember when we found each other
And we'll treasure the day that love walked inSix o'clock on Friday evening
Momma doesn' t know she's leaving
'Til she hears the screen door slamming
Rubber squealin', gears a-jamming
Local country station just a blaring on the radio
Pick him up at seven and they're headin' to the rodeo
Momma's on the front porch screamin' out her warning
Girl you better get your red head
Back in bed before the morning
Nine o'clock the show is ending
But the fun is just beginning
She knows he's anticipating
But she's gonna keep him waiting
Grab a bite to eat
And then they're heading to the honkey tonk
But loud crowds and line dancing
Just ain't what they really want
Drive out to the boondocks and park down by the creek
And where it's George Strait 'til real late
And dancing cheek to cheek
Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Going 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
Ten 'til twelve is wine and dancing
Midnight starts the hard romancing
One o'clock that truck is rocking
Two is coming, still no stopping
Break to check the clock at three
They're right on where they want to be
Four o'clock get up and going
Five o'clock that rooster's crowing
Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Going 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
Six o'clock on Saturday
Her folks don't know he's on his way
The stalls are clean, the horses fed
They say she's grounded 'til she's dead
Well here he comes around the bend
Slowing down, she's jumping in
Hey mom, you're daughter's gone
And there they go again
Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Going 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes upYou feel like a candle in a hurricane
Just like a picture with a broken frame
Alone and helpless
Like you've lost your fight
But you'll be alright, you'll be alright
'Cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend, till you break
Cause its all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad you get strong
Wipe your hands shake it off
Then you stand, then you stand
Life's like a novel
With the end ripped out
The edge of a canyon
With only one way down
Take what you're given before its gone
Start holding on, keep holding on
'Cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend till you break
'Cause it's all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad, you get strong
Wipe your hands, shake it off
Then you stand, then you stand
Every time you get up
And get back in the race
One more small piece of you
Starts to fall into place, yeah
Oh 'cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend, till you break
Cause its all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad you get strong
Wipe your hands, shake it off
You get mad you get strong
Wipe your hands
Then you stand, then you stand
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad you get strong
Wipe your hands, shake it off
You get mad you get strong
Wipe your hands, shake it off
Then you stand, then you stand
oh, oh, oh, oh oh
yeah, yeah
Then you standI'd like to be your mirror
Before it's someone else's turn
And try to get it right
And hope my karma improves
Or did i do you wrong
Or did i wait too long
Did i run through the trees
Did it cut you
Content to rest
Between the sky and the sea
Or did i do you wrong
Or did i wait too long
Did i run through the trees
Did it cut you
Content to rest
Between the sky and the seaShe put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart, he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, 'I'll love her till I die.'
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby
The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind
Until the night
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the angels sang a whiskey lullabyYour baby loves you now so don't make her blue now
You'd better start bein' true now I'm telling you why
Because if you break her heart somebody's gonna come along
And he'll steal her away from you somebody like me
Let me tell you friend I'm not botherin'
But I think it's such a sin if you don't treat her right
Because if you break her heart
She wants to be held tight now each and every night now
You'd better treat her right now I'm telling you why
Because if you break her heart
I hope you listen to now each word that I've told you now
These things you'd better do now or you will live alone
Because if you break her heart
Will steal her away somebody like meGimme some straight talk, straight talk
And hold the sugar please
Straight talk, straight talk
Sounds plenty sweet to me
Don't talk to me in circles
In some mumbo-jumbo jive
Gimme just straight talk, straight talk
And we're gonna be alright
'Cause I like to know just where I stand
I don't like guessing games
And I hate a bunch of gibberish
So just spit it out real plain
Don't use big educated words
From your BS Degree
Straight talk, straight talk
Don't try bossing me
Straight talk, straight talk
Turn loose and let it go
You can tell me anything
Just like on Oprah's show
Just tell me how you really feel
Be on the up and up
With questions I can understand
For answers you can trust
Pick up the 'phone, you're not alone
We've all got something to say
So listen in and listen up
We'll find a better way
With honesty and common sense
It's really hard to miss
Straight talk, straight talk
Just tellin' it like it is
Straight talk, straight talk
There's nothing like the truth
Just tell me all your troubles
Pretend I'm Donahue
So don't be shy, 'cause we can talk
You know you've got a friend
Call me, call me
For simple straight talkin'
What's cookin', America?
Straight talk, Straight talk
Straight talk, Straight talk
So come on let's talk turkey
Just straight and to the point
About passions, about problems
About noses out of joint
Now I want you all to know
I care and I do understand
And hey, thanks for lending me an ear
Out there in radio land
Give me some straight talk, straight talk
Don't sugar coat it please
Straight talk, straight talk
Sounds sweet enough to me
But don't talk to me in circles
In your mumbo-jumbo jive
Straight talk, straight talk
And we're gonna be alright
Straight talk, straight talk
Makes plenty sense to me
Don't talk to me in circles
In your mumbo-jumbo jive
Gimme just straight talk, straight talk
And we're gonna be alright
Gimme just straight talk, straight talk
And we're gonna be alrightOliver Stone, Oliver Stone
You really love the movies
Oh what a night for dancing with the one you love
Sunset hill, sunset hill
I really miss those parties
Oh what a life we lived then
I guess that's come and gone
But somewhere in space
There's a shimmering place
I need to find how that ladder's climbed
I'll catch a cab from there to witness your premiere
From London's Eye down Venice beach
Around the rings of Saturn
High over Yale my light sail
to find my shimmering dream
But somewhere in space
There's a shimmering place
I need to find how that ladder's climbed
I'll catch a cab from there to witness your premiere
Oliver Stone, Oliver Stone
I fear your sets have vanished
Oh paradise, you're a poltergeist
A thing that no one sees
But somewhere in space
There's a shimmering place
I'm still upset at that worthless tramp
For leaving me to die on that winter nightShe used to dream that She would be a celebrity and known for miles around
She'd dress up in her linens She'd sit and pretend She was a queen in Her gown
But I was just a boy from down the road and I was known as trouble in town
Thought to be the man who took the hand and changed the plans of sweet Jessie Brown
[Chorus]
Sweet Jessie Brown
Would you look at you now
She graduated early and to prep school we new surely
She was bound
Everybody tried to warn
Her I would be the one to try to bring
Her down
Because I told
Her there's a hole world out there for the two of
Us and it's waitin' to be found
And knew to be the man who would take the hand
And change the plans of sweet Jessie Brown
[Chorus]
On a road bound for nowhere a baby's cryin' was the only sound
Then the baby stopped it's crying and Jessie's world came tumblin' to the ground
I found a pill box on the dresser and note that She died holding in Her hand
It read I goodbye dear I love you and I'm sorry signed Jessie Brown
[Chorus]You say you don't know what you were thinking
Well neither do I
And after the time we spent together
You think you deserve another try
Well girl I don't know what it is
That you're expecting
Just because you looked me in the eye
And say you're sorry
Oh you're sorry
You want it back the way it was
Well I'm sorry
Sometimes sorry
Just ain't good enough
You say you never meant to hurt me
Well that might be true
But do you really think I should forgive you
For what you put me through
Oh I remember every time you said you loved me
But I know now your love was just a lie
And you say you're sorry
Oh you're sorry
You want it back the way it was
Well I'm sorry
Sometimes sorry
Just ain't good enough
Oh girl I don't know what it is
That you're expecting
Just because you look me in the eye
And say you're sorry
Oh you're sorry
So sorry
And you want it back the way it was
Well I'm sorry
But sometimes sorry
Just ain't good enoughLast night I dreamed I was in heaven
But your weren't there
And I was crying like a baby
Looking for you everywhere
And I saw waterfalls of life
Stars that didn't need a night
Somehow heaven wasn't right
Without you
Without you
My heart could never be free
Without you heaven couldn't be heaven to me
Everyone I meet was smiling all sorrow gone
Full of loneness inside me I wander on
And all the death had been destroyed
Forever cast into the void
Heaven couldn't be enjoyed
With out you
Without you
My life could never be free
Without you heaven couldn't be heaven to meChristina our first born you are so soft and warm as you lie between us softly sleeping
We gaze in admiration at God's tiny creation
And thank him and ask for your safe keeping
You were conceived through love you are a part of us
Christina you are a dream come true
We'll place you in God's hands and place you in our plans
Christina we'll take good care of you
And as we watch you grow we will always let you know how much we love you Christina
We'll take pride in all you do and we will always stand by you
Because we love you Christina Christina
You made our house a home brought joy we've never known Christina we love you so
With innocence sweet and fair blue eyes and angel hair
Through the years we'll watch you as you grow
We'll hold your little hand we'll love you all we can
We'll try to teach you right from wrong
You are God's gift to us we can't thank him enoughWhen I came to this morning she was packing up her things
Even with my pounding head I could hear her call me names
"you don't work, and drink and fish and dance and party-loving fool"
Rolled off her tongue and all I could say was "baby think it through"
And give me one good reason why you want to leave me
You know I love you baby just calm down and take it easy
Lay down here beside me
No need for quick decisions
Before you throw all this away
Give me one good reason
She said "you ain't brought a flower into this house in years
Your gift to me last valentine's was a case of your favorite beer.
Did I forget to mention I can't stand the sight of you?"
I said, "don't sugar-coat it baby, you know I can take the truth"
Give me one good reason why you want to leave me
You know I love you baby just calm down and take it easy
Lay down here beside me
No need for quick decisions
Before you throw all this away
Give me one good reasonToday my life is so much brighter and I know how love will always shine
Each day my heart is so much lighter and it's all because you are mine
You give me love and true devotion and all the little things so sweet and fine
I owe the world but yet I own it and it's all because you are mine
If love could be heaven I know I'll find mine
To try to live without you would be a waste of time
You give me love and true devotion...
And it's all because you are mine(Steve Goodman)
Ridin' on The City of New Orleans
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Two conductors and a-twenty-five sacks a' mail
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
And moves on along past houses, farms and fields
Passin' trains what ain't got no names
Switch yards full a' old black men
And the graveyards full of them rusted automobiles
[Chorus]
Good mornin' America, how are ya?
Well, a don'tcha know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
And I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
A-dealin' cards with an old man down in the club car
Just a penny a point ain't a-nobody keepin' score
Say won't you pass that there paper bag that's a-wrappin' the bottle
Feel them wheels rumblin' under that floor
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their daddy's magical carpet made out of steel
Mamas with their babies asleepin'
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rockin' rails is all they feel
[Chorus]
Good mornin' America, how are ya?
Well, a don'tcha know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
And I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
Night-time on The City of New Orleans
A-changin' cars a-down in Memphis, Tennessee
Well, a half way home, and a we gonna be there by mornin'
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rollin' down to that sea
Now all a' them towns and all the people seem
To fade away into a bad ol' dream
But the steel rail, well he still ain't heard that news
Conductor's a-singin' that song again
Sayin' "Passengers will please refrain
"This train done got the disappearin' railroad blues"
[Chorus]
Good night America, how are ya?
Well, a don'tcha know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
And I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
[Fade out.]
Mamas with their babies asleepin'
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rockin' rails is all they feel
Mamas with their babies asleepin'
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rockin' rails is all they feel
Yeah.There was a brand new stranger at the old bus station.
He said music city is my destination.
He said the whole wide world's gonna sing my song,
And you can take that to the bank.
I'm on a mission.
I'm on a mission.
I'm on a mission from Hank.
He got a furnished room and a job at the market.
He kept a little notebook in his back pocket,
And every time you'd see him he was writing a song.
And he would never leave one piece blank, (he'd say:)
I'm on a mission.
I'm on a mission.
I'm on a mission from Hank.
He sang when no one would listen,
So he sang until they hung on every word.
Ah, then one day his phone started ringing,
They said we want you and the songs you've been singing.
And the kid said fine, just give me some time
To talk to my patron saint. (You see:)
I'm on a mission.
I'm on a mission.
I'm on a mission from Hank.
(Yes sir,) that night, as he laid in the darkness,
Ol' Luke, the drifter, came to him and said:
Oh, now here's your chance, boy, go on and take it.
You sing from the heart, and you're gonna make it,
But if anybody tries to change you
Into something that you ain't, (you tell 'em:)
I'm on a mission.
I'm on a mission.
I'm on a mission from Hank.
I'm on a mission.
I'm on a mission.
I'm on a mission from Hank.The reason why I can't say
Gotta let you go babe and right away
After what you did I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
Baby for a long time you had me believe
You said your love was all mine and that's the way it would be
I didn't know that you were putting me on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
Oh when you're gone
I got to say that it's not like before
And I'm not gonna play your game anymore
After what you did I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
Oh when you're gone
Oh when you're gone
Oh when you're gone*I still think about us in the rush that we felt
With the rag top down and the radio blasting
You were riding shot gun in nothing but a bikini and a seat belt
Looking better than the law should have been allowing, oh mercy
We hit the corners going 90
Love had blindly fallen head over heels over you
Every feeling that we felt
Was a feeling that felt brand new
And you looked just like an angel
With that cross on your necklace
You were young, I was wild
We were reckless
We'd drive on down to the river
Burnin up those hot summer nights
Laughing at the cowboys getting crazy
Picking fights but it wasn't funny
When that deputy caught you and me
Steaming up those windows
And how your daddy never found out about it
Honey, heaven only knows
We hit the corners going 90
Love had blindly fallen head over heels over you
Every feeling that we felt
Was a feeling that felt brand new
And you looked just like an angel
With that cross on your necklace
You were young, I was wild
We were reckless, oh yeah
I looked into your eyes
And I promised you forever
And I beleived you without my heart
I just didn't know any better
Getting over you took years
How to spot those tears I cried
I'd do it all over again
All for the thrill of the ride
Hit the corners going 90
Love had blindly fallen head over heels over you
Every feeling that we felt
Was a feeling that felt brand new
And you looked just like an angel
With that cross on your necklace
You were young, I was wild
We were reckless
Young, wild and recklessToday I started loving you again now I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again
What a fool I was to think I could get by with only these few million tears I've cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come
And that crying time for me had just begun
Cause today I started loving you again
Today I started loving you again
Yes today I started loving you againBrother how far, from the saviour today
Risking your soul, for the things that he gave
Oh if today, God should call you away
What would you give, in exchange for your soul
What would you give, in exchange, what would you give, in exhange
What would you give, in exhange for your soul
Oh if today, God should call you away
What would you give, in exchange for your soul
Mercy is callin,' you won't you give in
Must the dear saviour, still tenderly plead
This night your soul, it is precious indeed
What would you give, in exchange for your soul
What would you give, in exchange, what would you give, in exhange
What would you give, in exhange for your soul
Oh if today, God should call you away
What would you give, in exchange for your, soul(Millions of roses) every single day
If I bought a flower for each happy hour
That you and your love have made life sweet
Millions of roses millions of roses would lie at your feet
For each time you hold me each love word you told me
If I work to bring the rose in blue
Millions of roses millions of roses would fill every room
What a way to show you all you mean to me
More than this I owe you for each memoryI'm going away for a while
Don't care how many miles
It takes it get wherever I go
As long as I can take it slow
And take my time
Finding a brand new heart
Making a breand new start
Been watching the whole world
Fall apart and the pieces
Keep on breaking, so
If I go on down this road
Hand out the window
Singing every song I love
Find me a boat, a plane
A take me home country road rain
Don't worry, I'm going away for a while
But I'll come back with a smile
I'll be kicked back in the shade
Nothing but buzz in my veins
Nobody knowing my name
I'm just a face and a place
A dot on the map
And it's too short of a life
I gotta enjoy the ride
I finally get to feeling alive
I'm taking off, I'm flying
And here I go on down this road
Hand out the window
Singing every song I love
Find me a boat, a plane
A take me home country road rain
Don't worry, I'm going away for a while
But I'll come back with a smile
And just outside this bar
There's a shop with a postcard
I'll write your name
Wish you were here
And I'll be back when things are clearer
So here I go on down this road
Hand out the window
Singing every song I love
Find me a boat, a plane
A take me home country road rain
Don't worry, I'm going away for a while
But I'll come back with a smileHad a bottle of wine and a perfectly fine dinner
Talk about school, work, life and how cold it was last winter
Lay down in this big 'ole bed and you turned on the TV
Fell asleep without a goodnight kiss or even an I love you
Baby, oh baby
How can we go on tonight and not even touch one another?
How can we say we're still in love and not be lovers?
How did we get here, where you can be right there
And I can be with you and miss you?
I remember the time, when every time you saw me you had to kiss me
But lying here tonight
Girl that all just seems like ancient history oh, what happened baby?
How can we go one night and not even touch one another?
How can we say we're still in love and not be lovers?
How did we get here, where you can be right there
And I can be with you and miss you?
Baby I still need you
Hold and touch you
Please say it's not the end
Oh baby please say we're not just friends
We can go all night
And not even touch one another no
Baby I'm, I'm still in love
So let's be lovers
You know it's not fair
That you can be right there
And I can be with you
Oh, oh and miss you
Oh baby I, I miss you darlin'
Oh I do, oh I do, layin' right next to you
I miss you girl
Oh yeah, oh baby I miss youHe'll buy you lots of pretty things fancy clothes and fancy rings
But he will never love you never more than I
Your pillard home all dressed in white will be cold on the summer's night
Cause he will never love you never more than I
Wealth and possession I admit I don't have very much of
I was born and raised a poor boy and all we had was love
So if you want what's made of clay take his hand and walk away
But he will never love you never more than I
[ ac.guitar ]
Wealth and possession I admit...
But he will never love you never more than II traded a heart full of love for a handful of kisses
That you were just throwing away
I traded a lifetime of dream for a few carefree moments
That you felt like wasting that day
If I had known you didn't care I wouldn't be so blue
Cause I'd have left my heart at home and played the game like you
I'm hoping that you had your fun cause that handful of kisses
Has broken my trusting heart in two
I gave you a love that was true for a heart that was fickle
I wish I had known at the time
You had me fooled for a while cause I thought that you meant it
When you said that you would be mine
But now that we have said goodbye I see the light of day
I had a moment of happiness but what a price to pay
I traded a heart full of love for a handful of kisses
That you were just throwing awayCome on Christmas
Please take me away
Keep me hidden safe
'Til January's second day
Come on Christmas
Come on Noel
I'll wrap myself up in the cheer
That's so abundant
This time of year
Come on Christmas
Come on Noel
Even though it's just September
I can forget to remember
All the empty nights
Still in my way
Come on Christmas
Embrace me with some joy
'Til the last few lonely moments
Of this year have been destroyed
Come on Christmas
Come on NoelThere was a tall oak tree that loved a bubblin' brook
And the bubblin' brook loved a mountain high
And the mountain high loved the sky above
The creator looked down and saw everything was loved loved loved
Then he took a bone and a piece of mud
He made a man and a woman to be flash and blood
Then along came a devil up bottom ground
He tempted woman and that's spred sin all around all around all around
If she'd've left that apple on the apple tree
There'd be no tears and sorrow we'd live eternaly
And then along came man to burn the oak tree down
And now the bubblin' brook is a solid ground
And the mountain high don't stand so high
And there's a cloud of smoke that covers up a clear blue sky
There was a tall oak tree there was a tall oak tree there was a tall oak tree(Ron Agnew)
The cowboy will never get married to you, girl
It's the fightin' that he just can't bear
But when there's women and whisky and beer-drinkin' brawls
The cowboy will always be there
He'll sing you sad songs, girl, 'cause that's all he knows
And soon you'll be listenin' to
Solutions to problems you don't even have
As he unloads his wisdoms on you
He'll have you believin' he's one-of-a-kind
And that his kind knows what livin's for
He's a dreamer by nature, a liar, and soon
He'll have you believin' he's more
He'll say he's a loner, to cover the truth
Some sympathy might see him through
Just a hand on his shoulder and a bottle of that booze
Then all he'll be needin' is you
He'll drink all your whisky, to clear out his head
Of the drinkin' he's already known
And with a little persuasion, he'll lie in your bed
And when you wake up, you're alone
Now you're feelin' sorry, and the cowboy is gone
He just a-has ta be a-movin' along
But honey when you get lonesome, turn your radio on
And the cowboy will sing you a songWell, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain
I got a head full of ideas that are drivin' me insane
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
And I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's brother no more
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's brother no more
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime
He asks you with a grin if you're havin' a good time
Then he fines you every time you slam the door
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's brother no more
Well, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's mama no more
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's mama no more
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law
Everybody says she's the brains behind Pa
She's sixty-eight but she says she's twenty-four
And I ain't gonna work on Maggie's mama no more
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
I try my best to be just like I am
But everybody wants you to be just like them
They sing while you slave and I just get bored
And I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no moreTroubled in mind, I'm little blue
Bet you I won't be blue always
'Cause that ol' sun's gonna shine
On Jerry lee Lewis's back door step someday
I'm gonna lay my head
On somebody's lonesome railroad line
Let that ol' midnight special
Ease my troubled mind
Well, they tell me that old graveyard
Is a mighty lonesome place
Lo0rd they put you six feet under
Shovellin' mud directly in your face
Will, goodbye baby, may God bless you
And may He bless ol' killer a little bit too
Oh, don't meet you over yonder, baby
When they throw that Jerry right over you
Troubled in mind, when I'm little blue
Bet you I won't be blue always
Cause the sun's gonna shine
On, on my back doorstep
Some lowdown, lonesome, mother humpin' dayTake me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
You see that girl with the red dress on,
Some folks call her Dinah
Stoled my heart away from me
Way down in Louisiana
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
The big bee sucks the blossom
And the little bee makes the honey
Poor man throws the cotton
And the rich man makes the money
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
We travel all over this country wide
Playing music by the hour
Always wear this great big smile
We never do look sour
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Would I go
You
Let me off
And I'll walk down to Greenwood
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marryIf love was a river
And I was a drowning man
Would you get in the water
Would you lend me a hand
If love was a river
Would you sit on the land
If love was a mountain
High above this town
Would you climb to the top
Would you never look down
If love was a mountain
Would you go around
Love may only knock so many times upon your door
And heaven only knows if it will come back anymore
If love was a firefly
Sitting in your hand
Would you laugh when it twinkled
Let it go again
If love was a firefly
Would you understand
If love was a party
With everyone you know
Would you dance if I asked you
Would you smile and say no
If love was a party
Would you even go
Love may only knock so many times upon your door
And heaven only knows if it will come back anymore
If love was a fast train on a one-way track
Would you turn in your ticket
Would you never look back
If love was a fast train
Would you even pack?We've been friends for a long long time
You tell me your secrets and I tell you mine
She's left you all alone and you feel like no one cares
But I have never failed you I've always been there
You tell your story it sounds a bit like mine
It's the same old situation it happens every time
Can't we see oh maybe you and me
Is what's meant to be
Or do we disagree
What if I told you (what if I said)
That I loved you
How would you feel
What would you think
What would we do
Do we dare cross that line
Between your heart and mine
Or would I lose a friend
Or find a love that would never end
What if I said
She doesn't love you
Oh it's plain to see
I can read between the lines of what your telling me
And he doesn't hold you the way a woman should be held
How long can I go on keeping these feelings to myself
What if I told you -(what if I said)
That I loved you
How would you feel
What would you think
What would we do
Do we dare cross that line
Between your heart and mine
Or would I lose a friend
Or find a love that would never end
What if I said
Oh we've both had our share of loneliness
So who's to say we can't have a little happiness
And if I found that in you
It would make my dreams come true
Or would you walk away

What if I told you -(what if I said)
That I loved you
How would you feel
What would you think
What would we do

Between your heart and mine
I've always wondered
From that day that we met
What if I said

All around the water tank
Waitin' for a train
A thousand miles away from home
Sleepin' in the rain
I walked up to a brakeman
Just to give him a line of talk
He says if you've got money boy
I'll see that you don't walk
Well I have'nt got a nickle
Not a penny can I show
Get off, get off you railroad bum
And he slammed the boxcar door
Well he put me off in Texas
A state I dearly love
The wide open spaces all around me
The moon and the stars up above
Nobody seems to want me
Or to lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from 'Frisco
Goin' back to Dixieland
Oh my pocketbook is empty
And my heart is full of pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home
Waitin' for a trainI know you're listening as I lay me down to sleep
It's not for me I ask, but my children's souls to keep
It seems the world is going crazy
And though I need to do my share
Could you please take them under wing
Watch over them especially
Keeping them safe from everything
This is a mother's prayer
I know you're listening in the silence of this night
The news is blistering but I hold on to your light
And though there's darkness all around us
By my faith I know you're there
Give me the strength to lead the way
Send me the words I need to say
Use me to guide them day to day
This is a father's prayer
I know I can't do this by my self
I thank you for your help
I know you're listening so I know I'm not alone
I feel you here with me as we all face the unknown
Could you return us to your garden
Where no one's hurt and no one's scared
Free us from pride and bitterness
Keep us so close we won't forget
Teach us to love as you love
This is a mother's prayer
This is a father's prayer
Teach us to love as you love
This is a mother's, a father's prayerWhen you close your eyes and you fall asleep
And it's down to the sound of a heartbeat
I can hear the things you're dreamin' about
When you open up your heart and the truth comes out
You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right
'Cause I hear it in the night
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
When I hold you in my arms at night
Don't you know that you sleep in the spotlight?
And all your dreams you keep inside
You're telling me the secrets that you just can't hide
You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right
'Cause I hear it in the night
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
When you're talking in your sleep
When you're talking in your sleepEverywhere you go each day
I will be near you
Oh and dear you
Don't even have to say much
For me to hear you
Because it's clear you
Have a very simple way
To keep me near you
Oh yeah dear
Through the power of love
Through the power of love
Every morning, night and noon
I will be near you
Oh and dear you
Won't even have to do much
For me to feel you
Are sincere you
Like a magnet pulls so strong
It keeps me near you
Oh yeah dear
Through the power of love
Through the power of love
I could try to just lie
And tell people I'm free
Live a wave tellin' sand
It won't go back to the sea
But what I say doesn't do no good
Like I ever thought I would
Everywhere you go each day
I will be near you
Oh and dear you
Don't even have to say much
For me to hear you
Because it's clear you
Have a very simple way
to keep me near you
Oh yeah dear
Through the power of love
Through the power of love
The power of love
The power of loveThe second she walked through the door, I caught a buzz
One taste from your lips knocked me out just like a drug
The rest of the night's kind of blurry
Now the sun's peeking through the shades
I can't help but laugh 'cause I kind of like feeling this way
I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love, love
Now I know whyy I'm feeling so high, high
'Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love, oh yeah
It's not in the whiskey, tequila or the wine
It's all about the touch and the fire in your eyes
It gets me fumbling always stumbling through a haze
I got plenty to do just laying here with you all day
I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love, love
Now I know whyy I'm feeling so high, high
'Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love, oh
Wish I could bottle you up and drink you in all day long
Every day singing this song
I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love, love
Now I know whyy I'm feeling so high, high
'Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love
(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love, on your love
On your love
On your love, on your love
On your love, get drunk on your love, yeah
I'm so drunk(Mrs Jones Mrs Jones)
Her real first name was Betty but I'd rather just forget it
So I'll call her the first Mrs Jones
We were married in September and it lasted till November
When one day she just took out on her own
I followed her to Savannah then Mobile and then Atlanta
Every day I begged her please come home
Pretty soon I started drinking tryin' hard to keep from thinking
Just how much I loved the first Mrs Jones
It was cold and dark one morning just before the day was dawning
When I staggered from a tavern to a phone
When she picked up her receiver I said you're gonna come back or either
They're gonna be calling you the late Mrs Jones
I put a pistol in my jacket stumbled out and hailed a taxi
Told taxidriver to take me to her home
I remember walkin' proudly and everybody said that I yelled out loudly
Come on out or I'm gonna come in Mrs Jones
Then next thing I recall was walking through the forest
Lookin' for a place to hide her bones
I dug and dug for hours and then I planted flowers
Right on top of the first Mrs Jones
Did my little story scare you I can see cause I'm so near you
Little beads of persperation dot your clothes
Aren't you sorry now that you left me
Ha really now don't you wanna come go with me
After all you are the second Mrs JonesLast Friday evenin'
I went to dry heavin'
Bent over double in pain
From out of my mouth
And right on a new Lexus
One hell of a load I sure swang
On my knees, I was throwin'
The owner was goin'
Inside to pay for his gasoline
I'm in a mess at the Texaco
Barfin' up refried beans
I'm down at the Texaco
Sick as a dog
My stomach's churnin'
My tail end is raw
I swear it's the last time
I'll eat another taco supreme
I'm in a mess at the Texaco
Barfin' up refried beans
No this picture ain't purdy, I ate number 30
And drank too much Mexican beer
Four shots of tequila, don't mix with fajitas
I'm prayin' a bathroom is near
I OD'd on tamales and green guacamole
Lord, I hope that the toilet is clean
I'm in a mess at the Texaco
Barfin' up refried beans
I'm down at the Texaco, smell like a hog
Knee deep in poo poo, the commode was clogged
Who used it the last time, ooh boy did it stink
Shoo at the Texaco because of those refried beans
I'm down at the Texaco, where's Tim McGraw?
While I'm sittin' here peelin' the paint off the walls
He's probably sippin' fine wine and dining on fancy cuisine
While I'm here at the Texaco from eatin' them refried beans
A mess at the Texaco from eatin' them refried beans
I said I'd be out in a minute
ThereA single mother with two children make lunches in the mornin'
And on her way to work, she drops 'em off at school
And tells them, 'Faith in me, faith in you'
A farmer kneels in his fields with dust pourin' through his fingers
Says I'm gonna lose you if it don't rain real soon
He looks up and says, 'Faith in me, faith in you'
Oh oh, I have to have faith that's where it all starts
I know I have to have faith in myself
It's feelin' that's found right here in my heart
And when I think about things and all the dreams
I wanna see come true let me tell you just what I do
I take a look in the mirror and I smile and say
'Have faith in me, faith in you'
In the shadow of the city, by the banks of the river
From the doorway of his cardboard room
A man cries out, 'Faith in me, faith in you'
Your form of poverty and prejudice over hunger and pain
Over social injustice, just watch as the bosses rein
Here 'em saying, 'Faith in me, faith in you'
Oh oh, I have to have faith that's where it all starts
I know I have to have faith in myself
It's feelin' that's found right here in my heart
And when I think about things and all the dreams
I wanna see come true let me tell you just what I do
I take a look in the mirror and I smile and say
'Have faith in me, faith in you'Oh they tell me of a home far beyond the sky
They tell me of a land far away
They tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
Oh they tell me of an uncloudy day
Oh the land of the cloudless day
Oh the land of the uncloudy sky
Oh they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
Oh they tell me of an uncloudy dayDynamite and whiskey
It's all the same
Tobacco in the sunshine
Sleeping in the rain
Jesus said for sure
He's coming back again
Dynamite and whiskey
It's all the same
Ain't no tomorrow
Hold me with no eyes
Stand back away
And you'll wait for a ride
Stand by the water
And you'll whisper something
Dynamite and whiskey
It's all the same
Rub it in your blood
Rub it on your mind
When she wipes just flapping out of time
I seen some things I won't see again
It's all the same
It's all the same
I think it's gonna rain
Dynamite and whiskey
It's all the same
Tobacco in the sunshine
Sleepin in the rain
Stand by the water
And you'll whisper something
Dynamite and whiskey
It's all the same
It's all the same
It's all the same
It's all the same
Dynamite and whiskey
It's all the same
It's all the sameIf the wife and I are fussin' brother that's our right
Cause me and that sweet woman's got a licence to fight
Why don't you mind your own business mind your own business
Cause if you mind your own business then you won't be mindin' mine
On the woman on our party line's a nosey thing
She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring
Why don't you mind your own businesss mind your own business
So if you mind your own business then you won't be mindin' mine
Well I got a little gal that wears her hair up high
The boys all whistle out every time she walks by
Why don't you mind your own businesss mind your own business
For if you mind your own business then you won't be mindin' mine
[ guitar ]
If I wanna honky tonk around till two or three
Brother that's my headache don't you worry bout me
Why don't you mind your own businesss mind your own business
So if you mind your own business then you won't be mindin' mine
Mindin' other people's business seems to be hightone
But I got all that I can do just midin' my own
Why don't you mind your own businesss mind your own business
For if you mind your own business then you won't be mindin' mine
For if you mind your own business you'll stay busy all the timeDon't go so far away love, try to settle down
For losing you would be more than I could bear
Tho' I'm tied to another, I hope someday she'll set me free
For I don't want a cheap love affair
I knew we loved each other the night that we first met
It just happened there was nothing we could do
Let me stay with my children til they can understand
That I love them and they'll know I love you too
[Chorus]
So darling please forgive me, don't give me all the blame
Tho' I know that it doesn't seem so fair
When I'm free I'll make you happy if you'll only wait for me
But I don't want a cheap love affair
[Chorus]If you love me half as much as I love you
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
You're nice to me when there's no on else around
You only build me up to let me down
If you missed me half as much as I've miss you
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
I know that I would never feel this blue
If you only loved me half as much as I love you
If you missed me half as much as I've miss you
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
I know that I would never feel this blue
If you only loved me half as much as I love you
If you only loved me half as much as I love youI cry myself to sleep each night
Wishing I could hold you tight
Life seems so empty since you went away
And the pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my empty dreams instead
And it keeps right on a-hurtin'
Since you're gone
It keeps right on a'hurtin every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it, I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
But when I see you passing by
My heart breaks down and cries a million tears
The pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my empty dreams instead
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone
It keeps right on a'hurtin every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it, I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone
Yes, it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're goneThere she was
Laughin', talkin', window shoppin' with a new guy
And I'd heard about him
I heard she found him right around when we said goodbye
And I came real close and almost lost my temper
But I bit my tongue, kept my cool, 'cause I remembered
[Chorus]
I don't care
She don't matter
I don't love her anymore, he can have her!
I don't know why it slips my mind
I tell myself all the time
Guess I forgot again for a second there
That I don't care
Almost ten
I should've known his car would still be parked in her drive
Almost pulled in
Knocked on her door and gave her a piece of my mind
Oh, but I just kept on driving back to my place
Wonderin' why I went so far out of my way when...
[Chorus]
When I got home, the light was blinkin' on that old machine
She said, "My brother's been in town, but he just left
And, I miss you! Give me a ring"
I still care!
She's all that matters!
I still love her just like always, gotta have her
I never got her off my mind, been hopin' she would call sometime
I know it's late, to be drivin' over there, but I don't care!
I don't careTwo highways lay before me, which one will I choose
Down one lane I'd find happiness and down the other I would lose
There is no one that I can trust, I must decide alone
My decision is an awful one, which road will take me home
In the mornin' would I wake to find, down the wrong road I have gone
Will I hear the melodies I've searched for oh so long
Only time will tell if I have made a loser's choice
And though sadness cries my inner soul, goodbye lover moans my voice
Perils, there are many, as I set out on my way
If I lose your love I know that I can call it back someday
Rambler, lonely rambler, just 'cause anyplace is home
Nashville, lights how you have always shined
Wishing now that you had found a word or two to say
But the mornin' came and we both knew my eyes gave it away
As I kissed your cheeks and said goodbye I thought only time will tell
And you can't draw water from an empty wellI was out on the West Coast, tryin' to make a buck
And things didn't work out, I was down on my luck
Got tired a-roamin' and bummin' around
So I started thumbin' back East, toward my home town
Made a lot of miles, the first two days
And I figured I'd be home in week, if my luck held out this way
But, the third night I got stranded, way out of town
At a cold, lonely crossroads, rain was pourin' down
I was hungry and freezin', done caught a chill
When the lights of a big semi topped the hill
Lord, I sure was glad to hear them air brakes come on
And I climbed in that cab, where I knew it'd be warm
At the wheel sit a big man, he weighed about two-ten
He stuck out his hand and said with a grin
"Big Joe's the name", I told him mine
And he said: "The name of my rig is Phantom 309
I asked him why he called his rig such a name
He said: "Son, this old Mack can put 'em all to shame
There ain't a driver, or a rig, a-runnin' any line
Ain't seen nothin' but taillights from Phantom 309
Well, we rode and talked the better part of the night
When the lights of a truck stop came in sight
He said: "I'm sorry son, this is as far as you go
'Cause, I gotta make a turn, just on up the road
Well, he tossed me a dime as he pulled her in low
And said: "Have yourself a cup on old Big Joe
When Joe and his rig roared out in the night
In nothin' flat, he was clean out of sight
Well, I went inside and ordered me a cup
Told the waiter Big Joe was settin' me up
Aw!, you coulda heard a pin drop, it got deathly quiet
And the waiter's face turned kinda white
Well, did I say something wrong? I said with a halfway grin
He said: "Naw, this happens every now and then
Ever' driver in here knows Big Joe
But son, let me tell you what happened about ten years ago
At the crossroads tonight, where you flagged him down
There was a bus load of kids, comin' from town
And they were right in the middle, when Big Joe topped the hill
It could have been slaughter, but he turned his wheel
Well, Joe lost control, went into a skid
And gave his life to save that bunch-a kids
And there at that crossroads, was the end of the line
For Big Joe and phantom 309
But, every now and then, some hiker'll come by
And like you, Big Joe'll give 'em a ride
Here, have another cup and forget about the dime
Keep it as a souvenir, from Big Joe and Phantom 309When this world is caught on fire
I wanna be caught in your will
No I never will give up, no, no
No I never will no, no
No I never will give up, no, no
No I never will no, no
And when this world is caught on fire
I wanna be caught in your will
I never will give up no, no,
No I never will, no, no, no, no, no
I'll always remember, ya, ya
You know I always will, ya, ya
I'll always remember, ya, ya
Ya know I always will, ya, ya
When they crucified my Lord up on Calverie's hill
I'll always remember, ya, ya
Ya know I always will ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
No I never will give up, no, no
No I never will no, no
No I never will give up, no, no
No I never will no, no
And when this world is caught on fire
I wanna be caught in your will
I never will give up no, no
No I never will, no, no, no, no, no
I'll always keep singin', ya, ya
Ya know I always will, ya, ya
I'll always keep singin' ya, ya
Ya know I always will, ya, ya
And when they crucified my Lord up on Calverie's hill
No I never will give up, no, no
No I never will, no, no, no, no, noOh the bells started ringing and the birds started singing
And the clock on the corner struck two
Thunder started crashing and the lightning started flashing
And I knew I was falling for you
I was standing on the corner when I knew that I's a goner
The first time you came into view
My head started rocking and my knees started knocking
And I knew I was falling for you
Oh the bells started...
[ steel ]
(Well you scared me half to death I could hardly catch my breath
Your smile made my heart go boom
And when I looked into your eyes I was almost paralyzed
And I knew I was falling for you)
Oh the bells started ringing...
Oh yes I knew I was falling for youNow I got a gal just different and though I know she's true
She's never really happy that gal she's feelin' blue
But I know my baby loves me in her own peculiar way
Yes my baby really loves me in her own peculiar way
Now I left her my apartment when I was out of town
When I got back I found that she had to burn the building down
But I know my baby loves me in her own peculiar way
Yes my baby really loves me in her own peculiar way
[ guitar ]
Now she took occurs and cooking and filled my heart with glee
Till I detected poison in the cake she baked for me
But I know my baby loves me in her own peculiar way
Yes my baby really loves me in her own peculiar way
Now she went down to the corner to catch a picture show
She said I'll see you later but that was twenty years ago
But I know my baby loves me in her own peculiar way
Yes my baby really loves me in her own peculiar wayI ain't never seen the big time
Honey that's okay with me
I ain't never seen the big time
Honey that's okay with me
Just a sittin' on this front porch
All the big time I'll ever need
I'll buy you a ticket to the big time
Might need a loan but that ain't nothin' new
Buy you a ticket to the big time
Might need a loan but that ain't nothin' new
They say I can't afford the big time?
Baby I'll just write an IOU
There ain't no one in the big time
That hangs out the laundry like you do
There ain't no one in the big time
That hangs out the laundry like you do
I'm a-having myself a big time
Just watching you rub and scrub the whole day through
I ain't never seen the big time
Honey that's okay with me
I ain't never seen the big time
Honey that's okay with me
Just a-sittin' on this front porch
All the big time I'll ever need
Just a-sittin' on this front porch
All the big time I'll ever needThe morning after the night before, I'm still feeling the glow
Is this what they write those songs about, maybe so
Your whispers echo inside my heart, your kiss is still on my lips
A certain something is telling me, this is it
There's something in the fire, you start each time you hold me
Something in the way I melt
I know just one thing, it's nothing like I've ever felt
Boy, this ain't just something, this is really something else
I don't know where this is gonna go, I don't know where it might end
We've got from now till forever, baby, until then
I'll surrender myself to you, I'll let go and let love
Take my hand and change my world and fill me up
There's something in the fire, you start each time you hold me
Something in the way I melt
I know just one thing, it's nothing like I've ever felt
Boy, this ain't just something, this is really something elseEvery time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time
Thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What I might say
There's a message
In the wild
And I'm sending you
This signal tonight
You don't know
How desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world
I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard
To understand
And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What my friends say
And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What my friends say
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I keep lying to myself
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What my friends say
Ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I keep lying to myself
Ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
Ain't missing you
Oh no
No matter what my friends might say
I ain't missing youThe news is out all over town that you've been seen a runnin' round
I know that I should leave but then I just can't go you win again
This heart of mine could never see what everybody knew but me
Just trusting you was my great sin what can I do you win again
I'm sorry for your victim now cause soon his head like mine will bow
He'll give his heart but all in vain and someday say you win again
You have no heart you have no shame you take true love and give the blame
I guess that I should not complain I love you still you won againFaded south out of Thunder Bay
Hit the interstate
And let the hand of fate just lead him on
She was heading north out of Baton Rouge
Nothing left to lose
All she knew was she had to get gone
Her engine blew in some Mississippi river town
He was passing through when she flagged him down
[Chorus]
Hey, you never ever know
Where the road will lead you
When you learn how to let go
They found something real
Something they could feel
When they let love take the wheel
Later on on down the road
When the radio
Played a song about Winslow Arizona
She said I'd love to stand on the corner there
He took it as a dare
Shifted gears and said tonight you're gonna
He talked about the future, she cried about the past
They talked about forever and never looked back
[Chorus: x2]I don't usually talk to strangers
But today this line's unusually long
I really like our conversation
So i guess this is goodbye on second thought hold on
Wait
It might sound crazy
I'm thinking maybe
We could talk and talk all day
This could be forever
We would never ever know it if this moment slips away
Wait
We could both just mind our business
Take our coffee cups and just be on our way
Or we could stop and take a minute
To find out if this spark
Really is a flame
Wait
It might sound crazy
I'm thinking maybe
We could talk and talk all day
This could be forever
We would never ever know it if this moment slips away
Wait
Its a million to one
but lets take it anyway
Wait
It might sound crazy
I'm thinking maybe
We could talk and talk all day
This could be forever
We would never ever know it if this moment slips away
WaitHe was a tall man
Raised up from the fields, out pickin' cotton
In a hard land where the ground was poor and the wood was rotten
But when he saw her
All those bad times were forgotten
And he believed, he believed
She was the strong hand
A good sister and a daughter
Lookin' for one man
To love the way that her mama'd taught her
And when she saw him
She thanked God for what he'd brought her she believed, she believed
And it's a miracle
How one soul finds another
Just one miracle
Is all it took my brother
For I have seen them
As they walk this world together
And I believe, I believe
It's a sad thing
When one must leave the other
And fly up where the voice rings
Out with all the multitudes that gather
But for a short while
Down here no song ever sounded sweeter
And we believed, we believed
For it's a miracle
How one soul finds another
Just one miracle
Is all it took my brother
And I will see them
Someday they'll walk again together
I believe, I believe
This I believe, I believeI think I feel like an old beat up two lane
The one that the state's not about to repair
From where I'm falling I think I might meet you
Below where we were just above just don't care
The way the world's changing I just can't accept it
No right or wrong all in between
The faith we were raised on is weathered and shaken
But baby it don't have to be
Cause I still believe in a prayer before supper
Passing the time round the old courthouse square
We've got nothing to keep us from start over Georgia
We'll leave all the baggage and start over there
Well I've never been to that part of the country
Save for some old movies and deep in my mind
Where it's accepted and even rewarded
To stand on your own right side of the line
Nobody wins here we're all scared of losing
I feel scarred right down to the bone
Maybe we'll find ourselves close to the ocean
Where freedom first breathed on it's own
Cause I still believe in a prayer
Oh we've got nothing to keep us[ Leon Rhodes ]
I was sitting alone with my memories and my yesterdays appear before me
I thought about our love so many times it's hard to keep living with you on my mind
Out of my mind oh please go away out of my heart I wish you would stay
Our love was shattered so many times
Won't someone please help drive you out of my mind
[ steel ]
I close my eyes and I see your face
And the one of the strangers that's taking my place
He holds the love that I once called mine
Won't someone please help drive you out of my mind
Out of my mind...He came to town with a lot of dreams swapped BMG for KFC
And four strings on his Gibson and now he's frying chicken
He swore someday the world of country music but he held on to his faded dreams
Would be his'n his jeans and cowboy hat
He drove a beat up Chevy truck he still leans in that microphone
And he didn't have no money says you want some fries with that
But he was such a god ole boy
Chorus: The last time that I saw him
Back when he was hungry he was singin' down at Tootsie's
He wrote some songs and walked the streets a big tattoo on both his arms
Beggin' folks to listen and his earring was a beauty
Sometimes he crawled just like a snake he said I'm goin' rock'n roll
Without a pit to hiss in those guys make all the money
He looked like Garth and sang like Hank from now on you can call me
And everybody loved him the Artist Formerly Known As Hungry
He swore he'd never change a thing back when he was hungry
Back when BMI and CMA were only letters
And R&R; was what you took to get to feeling better
And Billboard was a road sign not a chart that came on Monday
Life was oh so simple back then back when he was hungry
And then one day he wrote a song that got someone's attention
The A&R; at BMG got J-O-E to listen
Then Joe called James and James called Don
Don called Mrs Hilley and Oermann wrote he's gonna be
The next big hot hillbilly well his record went to Number One
And the good ole boy went crazy he hired a band then fired a band
He toured and then got lazy suddenly he knew it all
The rest of us were dummies he scarcely could remember
Back when he was hungry
Well he married and then he got divorced and met this cute young honey
He thought she craved his body but she only craved his money
She cleaned out his bank account then ran off with his drummer
Left him where he started from back when he was hungry
Well he lost his deal and life got real and he had to give up pickin'The snow is falling It's Christmas Eve
Presents are wrapped Under the tree
Is there one for me?
I only want you for Christmas, baby
I don't need nothing else
I only want you for Christmas, baby
Tie a ribbon 'round yourself
Oh, tie a ribbon 'round yourself
I ain't gonna write no letter Send north to the pole
Cause what I'm wanting this year Saint Nick don't need to know
I only want you for Christmas, baby
I don't need nothing else
I only want you for Christmas, baby
Tie a ribbon 'round yourself
Oh, tie a ribbon 'round yourself
So put on your Christmas stockings I'll find that mistletoe
Let's get into the the holiday spirits
And honey ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
I only want you for Christmas, baby
I don't need nothing else
I only want you for Christmas, baby
Tie a ribbon 'round yourself
I only want you for Christmas, baby
I don't need nothing else
I only want you for Christmas, baby
Tie a ribbon 'round yourself
Oh, tie a ribbon 'round yourself
Woo ooh (train noise)
Oh I had a bicycle
I had a train tooI was sitting on top of the world
Deep in love with a blue-eyed girl
But the blue-eyed girl told me goodbye
I fell like rain drops out of the sky
Down at the bottom of a broken heart
You will find her name
Written on a block of stone
That once was a burning flame
Now it's cold, lonely and dark
Way down here at the bottom of a broken heart
I took my love for Sally Ann
And I buried if deeper than a chinaman
Where no one goes and no one can see
There ain't nobody here but me
Down at the bottom of a broken heart
You will find her name
Written on a block of stone
That once was a burning flame
Now it's cold, lonely and dark
Way down here at the bottom of a broken heart
One day true love's gonna set me free
But till then i'll be here deep in misery
Down at the bottom of a broken heart
You will find her name
Written on a block of stone
That once was a burning flame
Now it's cold, lonely and dark
Way down here at the bottom of a broken heartWell I stayed up all night
I've been doing it for years
Sleep is not my friend 'cause dreams just feed my tears
So I laughed my way around
I've been everybody's girl
I drank for forgiveness till I drank up the world
Change
Nobody's here to hold me
Change
And the morning's cold and lonely
But I think I can change my life
Change
There's a light outside my window
Peepin' through the blinds
There's a life out there worth livin'
But there's nothing here to find
Just a book of people's numbers
That are just as scared as me
Dialing for a dimes worth
Of pain and company
Change
Nobody's here to hold me
Change
And the morning's cold and lonely
But I think I can change my life
Change
No matter where I turn
There's no escape I see
I'm just staring in this mirror
And that stranger can't be me
But I think I can change my life
You'll see a change in me
Well I'm sittin' in this room
With my cigarettes and wine
I'm out of all the other stuff
And now I'm running out of time
Change
Nobody's here to hold me
Change
I'm so cold and so lonely
But I think I can change my life
You'll see a change in meThe movers came today
To take our things away
Memories that we held so dear
One by one they're out of here
I hung the "For Sale" sign
On what was yours and once was mine
One last look around to find
Any home we might have left behind
But the emptiness rings true
There's really nothing left to do
[Chorus:]
'Cause I'm not needed here now
You made it clear to me somehow
If it's not built on love
A home is just a house
So I'll close and clock this door
Not comin' back here anymore
It's time to face the fear
I'm not needed here now
That's where he said his prayers
And learned to climb the stairs
Every room has history
That holds a part of you and me
In my heart it's getting through
It's tellin' me that without you
[Chorus]Blue lights flashing in my rear view
The sheriff said, "Boy I should've known it was you
You got fourteen people in the back of this truck
I warned you twice and now I'm writing you up"
I said "Officer, what have I done?"
He smiled and said, "Boy you're having too much fun"
Too much fun, what's that mean?
It's like too much money, there's no such thing
It's like a girl too pretty with too much class
Being too lucky, a car too fast
No matter what they say, I've done
But I ain't never had too much fun
There was a fight Friday night at the stumble inn
Me and 'ole Harley just had to join in
Next thing you know we were both seeing stars
They threw us out, closed down the bar
I said, "The Long Branch is open the night's still young
And we ain't never had too much fun"
Too much fun, what's that mean?
It's like too much money, there's no such thing
It's like a girl too pretty with too much class
Being too lucky, a car too fast
No matter what they say, I've done
But I ain't never had too much fun
I'm a holly terror, a tornado
Wind me up, turn me loose and let me go
Too much fun, what's that mean?
It's like too much money, there's no such thing
It's like a girl too pretty with too much class
Being too lucky, a car too fast
No matter what they say, I've done
But I ain't never had too much fun
No matter what they say, I've done
'Cause I ain't never had to much fun
Give me the reigns and let me run
'Cause I ain't never had to much funLittle sister don't you, little sister don't you
Little sister don't you kiss me once or twice
Tell me that it's nice and then you run
Yeah, yeah, little sister don't do what your big sister done
You know I dated your big sister
Oh, I took her to the show
Hey I went for some candy
Along came Jim Dandy
And they slipped right out the door
Little sister don't you, little sister don't you
Little sister don't you kiss me once or twice
Tell me that it's nice and then you run
Yeah, little sister don't do what your big sister done, hup, hup, hup, hup
I used to pull down on your pigtails
Hey girl, and pinch your turned up nose
Oh, but baby you been growin'
And lately it's been showin'
From your head down to your toes
Little sister don't you, little sister don't you
Little sister don't you kiss me once or twice
Tell me that it's nice and then you run
Yeah, little sister don't do what your big sister done, hup, hup, hup oh get on
Every time I see your sister
Lord, she's with somebody new
Aw, she's mean and she's evil
Like a little ol' boll weevil
Think I'll try my luck with you
Little sister don't you, little sister don't you
Little sister don't you kiss me once or twice
Tell me that it's nice and then you run
Hey, little sister don't you do what your big sister done
Well, little sister don't you do what your big sister done
Aw, little sister don't you do what your big sister doneOh oh
Wall to wall, it's packed
Give your hands a smack
Polish up my watch
VIP is in the back
Hear the beat of the music playing
Rat pack, hi-hat swaying
I'll blaze it up and braise it
I'm saying
Just like the roof is on fire
So turn up the heat
All my friends are here
But the drinks on me
Pretty girls around
Everywhere you look
It's right on my face
You can say I'm hooked on
This crazy life I'm living
This crazy love I'm giving
Sit back, just watch, you'll see
You can try but you can't stop me
You can't stop me
No, you can't, come on T
Oh no, the goose is loose
Just feeling up this groove
Don't it feel nice
Burning up these lights
Those green eyes, I've been watching
Got me all caught up and
The way your hips are talking
I can't stop it
Just like the roof is on fire
So turn up the heat
All my friends are here
But the drinks on me
Pretty girls around
Everywhere you look
It's right on my face
You can say I'm hooked on
This crazy life I'm living
This crazy love I'm giving
Sit back, just watch, you'll see
You can try but you can't stop me
You can't stop me
Ah no, you can't
Bring the heat back
I could party with you, you could party with me
If you party with us, then you better believe
That the lights are up in this town
But they're about, about to go down
And it's about midnight
Oh, I don't think she might
Told her to spin around, all around this town
Feels like the roof is on fire
So turn up the heat
All my friends are here
But the drinks on me
Pretty girls around
Everywhere you look
It's right on my face
You can say I'm hooked on
This crazy life I'm living
This crazy love I'm giving
Sit back, just watch, you'll see
You can try but you can't stop me
You can't stop me
No, you can't
Oh no, girl
Just try to stop me, baby
Try to stop me baby
Try to stop me baby, oh oh
Just try to stop me baby
Just try to stop me baby, na, na, na, na, na, naSometimes when life's poison arrows shoot me to the ground
Dreams come fallin' down, friends just can't be found
I don't worry, I don't wonder, I know what to do
I don't go crazy, I just go for you
Surround me with love, I need you beside me
I want you to hold and hide me
When this world is closin' in on me
Surround me with love, oh and I can make it
Whatever comes, you know I can take it
Just as long as you surround me with love
Who can say what comes tomorrow, what the future holds?
What lies down the road, heaven only knows
But one thing I know for certain, one thing that's true
One thing I'm sure of is I need you
Surround me with love, I need you beside me
I want you to hold and hide me
When this world is closin' in on me
Surround me with love, oh and I can make it
Whatever comes, you know I can take it
Just as long as you surround me with loveTHAT LITTLE BOY OF MINE
(Wayne King - Benny Maroff - Walter Hirsch)
'47 Edwin H. Morris & Co
A tiny turned up nose his cheek's just like a rose
So sweet from head to toe that little boy of mine
He's all the world to me he climbs upon my knee
To me he'll always be that little boy of mine
No one will ever know just what his coming has meant
Because I love him so he's something heaven has sent
A tiny turned up nose his cheek's just like a rose
So sweet from head to toe that little boy of mine
No one will ever know just what his coming has meant
Because I love him so he's something heaven has sent
He's all the world to me he climbs upon my knee
To me he'll always be that little boy of mineWell your mama finds it hard to understand
Why her lovin' son wants to be a rodeo man
And your daddy had a whole lotta great big plans for you
But you hate to disappoint him but you got other things to do
Now your best girl thinks it's time you settle down
You finally graduated and she's ready for a weddin' gown
But there's a great big world just a-waitin' out there for you
And if she really loved ya she can wait another year or two
And nobody really knows how you feel inside
The road gets rough and the goin' gets tough but you know you've got to try
And there ain't no way they're ever gonna change your mind
Don't everybody know a cowboy's got to ride
Now your high school buddies say, man you've gone insane
Don't you know rodeo's a crazy foolish game?
But you can see in their eyes a little bit of jealousy
They're all workin' nine to five, you're footloose and fancy freeI'm a lone country mile from bein' style
Dirty hat an cowboy boots
I cut my teeth on them old outlaw songs
My daddy used to listen to
Guess it's in my genes
I gotta be me
Yeah I say what I think
But sometimes I drink
And when I do I drink too much
Wind up on my back
Eye shinin' black
And I know it's all because bad as it might be
Hey I gotta be me
You can wine me up an dine me
You can polish up an shine me but the real things gonna shine through
It ain't always pretty but the cowboy in me
Couldn't change if he wanted to
Yeah I had a girl her name was Pearl
I think she's up in Arkansaw
She raised her voice and gave me a choice
'Tween singin' in a Honkeytonk or JOB
As u can see I gotta be me
Yeah you can wine me up an dine me
You can polish up an shine me but the real things gonna shine through
It ain't always pretty but the cowboy in me
Couldn't change if he wanted toSome people run some people crawl some people don't even move at all
Some roads lead forward some roads lead back
Some roads are bathed in light and some wrapped in fearful black
Some people never get some never give some people never die and some never live
Some folks treat me mean some treat me kind
Most folks just go their way and don't pay me any mind
Time oh good good time where did you go time oh good good time where did you go
Sometimes I'm satisfied sometimes I'm not
Sometimes my face is cold and sometimes it's hot
At sunset I laugh sunrise I cry at midnight I'm in between and I'm wondering why
Time oh good good time where did you go time oh good good time where did you goSeven years with the wrong woman is more than a man can stand
Seven years with the wrong woman will wreck most any good men
Seven years with the wrong woman it's the same in the mountain or dale
She'll stay awake all night tryin' to start a fight then have you thrown in the jail
Seven years with the wrong woman is punishment there is bad
Seven years with the wrong woman will drive most any man mad
When you married the wrong woman there is only one thing you can do
Dig yourself a hole crawl in the hole then put the ground over you
Listen boys if you're thinking of marriage take warning to what I tell
Don't you marry the wrong woman it's worse than living in jail
Seven years with the wrong woman it'll end you and turn your hair gray
They say love is blind but search till you find a face you can stand every dayWhy do you treat me as if I were only a friend
What have I done that makes you so diff'rent and cold
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be contented again
Will you be happy when you are withered and old
I cannot offer you diamonds or mansions so fine
I cannot offer you clothes that your young body crave
But if you'll say that you long to forever be mine
Think off the heartaches the tears and the sorrow you'll save
When you are weary and tired of another men's gold
When you are lonely remember this letter my own
Don't try to answer though I've suffered anguish untold
If you don't love me I wish you would leave me alone
While I am writing this letter I think of the past
And of the promises that you are breaking so free
But to this world I will soon say my farewells at last
I will be gone when you read this last letter from meWhen I fly off this mortal earth
And I'm measured up by depth and girth
The Father says now what's he worth
May he see Jesus death and birth
Don't measure me by dollar signs
Or bricks and mortar you may find
By Christ alone will I be found
Worthy of that golden crown
Worthy of that golden crown
The value of this life I've lived
How did I love, did I forgive
Where did my treasure truly lay
How did I start and end each day
Don't measure me by battles won
Or some good deed that I have done
By Christ alone will I be found
Worthy of that golden crown
Worthy of that golden crown
May be a pauper or a king
Have nothing or have everything
The question begs, do you belong
Do you sing a resurrection song
Measured by the master's hand
On only one truth can we stand
By Christ alone will we be found
Worthy of that golden crown
Worthy of that golden crownWill it be my Uncle Ronnie, I barely knew him when he left
He was only nineteen when he crashed that red Corvette
Will it be my great grandmother with some cookies that she baked
Oh, I wonder who's gonna greet me at the gate
Will it be my goodfriend Matthew who spent his life in a chair
Will he coming running to me the day I get up there
Or that bully back in high school I told my Mama that I hate
Oh, I wonder who's gonna greet me at the gate
Will it be a choir of Angels with some heavenly refrain
Or Saint Peter like I've always heard with his big book of names
Will it be my old dog, Bailey, who died when I was eight
Oh, I wonder who's gonna greet me at the gate
[Instrumental Interlude]
I pray it's not my wife, my daughter or my son
Cause that would mean the good Lord took em before my time was done
Tonight, they're all sound asleep as I lie here wide awake
And I wonder who's gonna greet me at the gate
We're brought into this world with God only knows how many years
We crawl, we walk, we run, we dance
We cry a million tears
And in a flash our lives are over
And we're face to face with fate
Oh, I wonder who's gonna greet me at the gate
Who's gonna greet me at the gateJesus touch my sinful soul and let my cry for peace come to a hush
Let my footsteps follow Thee and help me walk across the bridge of love
Over the river of life's intentions
Across the bridge of love to the arms of my salvation
Jesus give me strength enough for me to walk across the bridge of love
Over the river of life's intentions
Across the bridge of love
Help me to walk across the bridge of loveI know you think you are hurting me and I must admit this is true
But the hurt I am feeling I know I'll get over but look what you're doing to you
This world holds so many temptations and I have had one or two
But the promise of evening grows dim in the morning so look what you're doing to you
Strange lips taste better then warm so familar
Old words sounds sweeter when new arms are holding you tight
My love isn't new but it's lasting it's real it's strong and it's true
And I love you so much I don't care if you hurt me so look what you're doing to you
[ strings ]
So look what you're doing to youThere's never been a man
who could bring me down
I've walked away from the toughest of towns
But her last words tore me apart
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Brought me to knees like a shot from the dark
Her sweet love found its mark
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Her soft warm touch took me by surprise
I was blinded by the love in my eyes
The moment she left I felt the pain start
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Her good bye hit me in the heart
Brought me to my knees
like a shot from the dark
Her sweet love found its mark
Her good bye hit me in the heartI'm a wanted man

WRITER BOB DYLAN
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Cannot hold you to its heat.
Your temperature's too hot for taming,
Your flaming feet burn up the street.
I am homeless, come and take me
Into reach of your rattling drums.
Let me know, babe, about my fortune
Down along my restless palms.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
I have fallen far beneath
Your pearly eyes, so fast an' slashing,
An' your flashing diamond teeth.
The night is pitch black, come an' make my
Pale face fit into place, ah, please!
Let me know, babe, I got to know, babe,
If it's you my lifelines trace.
I been wond'rin' all about me
Ever since I seen you there.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding,
I know I'm 'round you but I don't know where.
You have slayed me, you have made me,
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
I got to know, babe, will I be touching you
So I can tell if I'm really real.Ah! Du temps que j'etais jeune

And I was gonna be rich no matter how much it cost, and I was gonna win no matter how much I lost all through the years I've kept my eye on the prize, you ask if it's worth the sacrifice, the sacrifice.Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San AntoneOh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh
I wanna see the world
I wanna touch your face
I wanna go right there
And never leave that place
I wanna fall back down
I wanna lose the day
I wanna get it back
In the baddest way
I know it's there
Still see us there
How'd we get away
How'd we get away
Midnight, pick you up
Take you on a slow drive
You and I hanging there
Kissing in the street light
Didn't matter where or when
We just went every time
So tell me will you take me there
Somewhere only you know where
I know we can be better
Than we've ever been
If we could be us again
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh, us again
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh
We were a Friday night
After a football game
We were the coolest car
Moving down the interstate
Oh, I know it's there
Still see us there
How'd we get away
How'd we get away
Midnight, pick you up
Take you on a slow drive
You and I hanging there
Kissing in the street light
Didn't matter where or when
We just went every time
So tell me will you take me there
Somewhere only you know where
I know we can be better
Than we've ever been
If we could be us again
Soaked us, deep in love
We would fall every time
We got back up
So we laid there
And just lose tonight
So baby why don't I
Midnight, pick you up
Take you on a slow drive
You and I
Kissing in the street light
Didn't matter where or when
We went every time, yeah
Midnight, pick you up
Take you on a slow drive
You and I hanging there
Kissing in the street light
Didn't matter where or when
We just went every time
So tell me will you take me there
Somewhere only you know where
I know we can be better
Than we've ever been
If we could be us again
If we can be us again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohMy bills are all due and the babies need shoes,
But I'm Busted
Cotton's gone down to a quarter a pound
And I'm Busted
I got a cow that's gone dry
And a hen that won't lay
A big stack of bills
Getting bigger each day
The county's gonna haul my belongings away,
But I'm Busted
So I called on my brother to ask for a loan
'Cause I was Busted
I hate to beg like a dog for a bone,
But I'm Busted
My brother said, "there's not a thing I can do,
My wife and my kids
Are all down with the flu
And I was just thinkin' about callin' on you,
'Cause I'M Busted."
Lord, I ain't no thief, but a man can go wrong,
When he's Busted
The food that we canned last summer is gone,
But I'm Busted
Now the fields are all bare
And the cotton won't grow
Me and my family's gotta pack up and go
But I'll make a living, just where, I don't know
'Cause I'm BustedI was born to love you so what can I do
Sometimes you've hurt me deep inside
And you're so careless with my pride
But when you touch me the world is new
I was born to love you so what can I do
Sometimes you're distant and you're cold
And it's a stranger that I hold
But when you want me my dreams come true
I was born to love you so what can I do
No matter what I do I think about you
Those lonely hours when you're away
If I try to live my life without you
I couldn't make it for a dayWhere is my love
Where is my love
Horses galloping
Bring him to me
Where is my love
Where is my love
Horses running free
Carrying you and me
Where is my love
Where is my love
Safe and warm
So close to me
In my arms
Finally
There is my love
There is my love
Horses galloping
Bringing him to me
Where is my love
Where is your loveYou don't understand the pattern of my life because my life has got no pattern
You don't see and you can't feel the wind
That's blowing at my back and saying move boy
You think this burning fever in my heart is just a folly
And I'm throwing away my happiness by leaving you
Well it's my life throw it away if I want to
I've tried my best to plant my feet and stay with you but all I feel is roots grow
And what man wants a woman who won't satisfy his heart and soothe his ego
I sleep all day and run all night and you tell me that that ain't right
That ain't what the husbands of your friends do
But it's my life throw it away if I want to
You try to make me think my nonconforming life has colored me some evil shade
You delight and filling up my mind with a little bits of guilt you think I oughta feel
Well I'm tired of feeling guilty and I'm tired of having nothing
And I'm throwing away this life you've had me shackled to
It's my life throw it away if I want to
I've tried my bestI've been with you for a fairly long time
May I call you, may I call you, may I call you mine?
And you are near and been with me
May it always, may it always, may it always be
Please dont leave my side, remember I love you
None of what I have done wrong was really done against you
If you love me and Im weak, then weaker you must love me more
To reinforce whats all so strong and all the love we have in store
By example you showed me, livings alright
Stay here with me, stay here with me, stay with me tonight
And come with me when I go to the bedroom
And well play bride, and well play bride and well play bride and groom
If you had not been born you know
What would I? What would I be then?
I would not have strength to grow
And be counted, and be counted among men
Please dont leave my side, remember I love you
None of what I have done wrong was really done against you
If you love me and Im weak, then weaker you must love me more
To reinforce whats all so strong and all the love we have in store
And in the morning well wrestle and ruin our stomachs with coffee
Wont we be, wont we be, wont be happy?
We will rise in anger, love and ardor
Shining, shining, shimmering in love's armorSlowly I'm falling more in love with you
Slowly you're winning a heart that can be true
I can't hide my feelings no matter what I'd do
'Cause slowly I'm falling more in love with you
More and more I need you and want you by my side
More and more I love you as each day passes by
No need to hide my feelings for it's so plain and true
Slowly I'm falling more in love with you
Slowly I'm falling more in love with youWhy do you treat me as if I were only a friend
What have I done that makes you so different and cold
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be contented again
Will you be happy when you are withered and old
I cannot offer you diamonds and mansions so fine
I cannot offer you clothes that your young body craves
But if you'll say that you long to forever be mine
Think of the heartaches the tears and the sorrow you'll save
When you were lonely and tired of another one's gold
When you were weary remember this letter my own
Don't try to answer though I've suffered anguish untold
If you don't love me I wish you would leave me alone
While I am writing this letter I think of the past
And of the promises that you are broking so free
But to this old world I will soon say my farewell at last
I will be gone when you read this last letter from meWell, a devil like me needs an angel like you
To really tame me down
'Cause if this devil had an angel like you
I'd stop my runnin' around
I'd stay at home like a good man should
And never ever make you blue
'Cause a devil like me needs an angel like you
You bet your little hearty do
Well, I never been one for steady girls
I've always played the field
This warning, that warning, ever other which one
Was just another spinnin' wheel
But when you've walked in with your big green eyes
And your pretty little dress of blue
I knew a devil like me needs an angel like you
You bet your little hearty do
Well, if a devil me had an angel like you
I'd change my reputation
But a devil like me with a shady hairs
Ain't got no recommendation
I give you real love true love, a whole lotta sweet love
And I make your every dream come true
Yes, a devil like me needs an angel like you
You bet your little hearty do
Well, a devil like me needs an angel like youThey buy you dinner open your door
Other then that what are they good for
Men I'm talking about men
They all want a girl just like the girl that married dear old dad
They make me so mad
Men I'm talking about men
[Chorus]
Well you can't beat 'em up cause they're bigger then you
You can't live with 'em and you just can't shoot 'em
Men, I'm talking about men
They love their toys, they make their noise
They're nothing but a bunch of over grown boys
Men, I'm talking about men
If you give 'em what they want they never fall in love
Don't give 'em nothing they can't get enough
Men, I'm talking about men
[Chorus]
In the beginning they always aim to please
They serve a purpose they fill a need
They ensure the survival of the species
They take you for a ride run of gas
Most of the time they're a pain in the Yea, yea
Men I'm talking about menShe was sitting on a stool in a little bar
Called the Seldom Seen
When I walked over and said, "Hi", introduced myself
"And what's your name?", I asked, she just smiled
She was wearin' a tiny gold chain
With the initials SS on the front
And I said, "Wait a minute you are Susie Smith?"
She shook her head
"kay, you're Sally Simpson, Sarah?"
And before I could finish she put her hand on mine
And said, "Look it's not important."
And I said, "Okay, I'll just call you Double S."
And she nodded
And I said, "What are you drinkin' Double S?"
She said, "Scotch'n'Soda."
And I said, "Okay Double S one Scotch'n'Soda comin' up."
"You live around here?", I asked
"No she said just killin' time till the morning."
"I got an early plane back to California."
"I live near San Simeon."
"Oh, and you'll be flyin' on a 7-0-7 no doubt?", I said
"How did you know?" she asked
"Oh, I guess I'm just super-smart."
"You gonna spend the rest of the night in this bar Double S?"
"No," she said,
"I have a motel room I'm at the Surfing Sand."
"Can I give you a lift?"
"Thanks, I rented a car but I don't drive it too well."
She answered
"It's a stick-shift, haha
"Double S you are something-special.", I said.
And paid the man and we walked out
In the cool evening breeze.
She slid across the seat and snuggled up close to my side
And I began to run my fingers through her hair
It was soft'n'silky. I opened the door to her room
My lips found her lips and I held her close
And whispered, ''You are a super-sexy lady
She simply smiled.
I could feel her body slowly soften as her sensuous soul
Swiftly swept me into sublime serenity
Her plane left just as the morning sun
Began to softly streak the starry sky
She kissed me a soft so long, waved a sultry
So long from the window
And I never saw Double S again
Right now she's soaring somewhere above the clouds
And I'm walking home on one
And I just realized I never did find out
What Double S stood for
All I know is our time together was short and sweet...(VERSE 1)
He woke up on a cold floor
In a motel on the south side of nowhere and he swore
That this is the last time
Like the last time before
Just like the last time before
(CHORUS)
But the wheels keep turning 'round
The engines they never slow down
And he knew that these tracks would lead to heartache and pain
But he still got on that train
(VERSE 2)
Theres a girl down in Georgia
Broken home-coming queen, knocked around black and blue
Said this is the last time
This time I know that we're through
Oh this time I swear that we're through
(CHORUS 2)
But the wheels keep turning 'round
The engines they never slow down
And she knew that these tracks would lead to heartache and pain
But she still got on that train
(VERSE 3)
I wake up in a cold bed
Playing shows every night on this long lonely road
I'm thinking of you
And I just wanna come home
Oh but I'm just too far from home
(CHORUS 3)
But the wheels keep turning 'round
The engines they never slow down
And I knew that these tracks would lead to heartache and pain
But I still got on that train
And I knew that these tracks would lead to heartache and pain
But I still got on that train
Got on that train....I heard that warnin' whistle blowin'
I knew that train was comin' fast
The sound of the wheels was hypnotisin'
I could not move from it's path
I just stood there, glued to the tracks
[Chorus]
It was a long time comin'
She was a heartbreak waitin' to happen
And I went right along
It was a long time comin'
Before I knew what hit me, she was gone
She was so gone
Those cold black eyes that burned right through me
Could melt a heart of steel
I just pulled her closer to me
'Cause I loved the way it made me feel
Underneath her wheels
[Chorus]
It was a long time comin'
Before I knew what hit me, she was gone
Before I knew what hit me, she was gone
She was so gone, so gone
So gone
So goneHow many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I could do things my way
But little they know it's so hard to find one rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
Well once I was waiting in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for turned to start in life's game
Then suddenly it happened I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind
[ steel ]
Money won't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person's a proper at times compared to the man with a satisfied mind
When my life has ended my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave there's no doubt
But one thing for certain when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind
I'm gonna leave this old world with a satisfied mindJust getting by is getting old
Locked up inside this pigeonhole
Breaking my back with my bare hands
Some of us can't some of us can
I don't have it in me
A bullet needs a gun
And in the land of plenty
They need a champion
I'm one more of many
Not a lion on the sun
Been hanging ?round and holding on
Here underground way too long
Losing my mind digging for gold
All I can find as life unfolds is
I don't have it in me
A bullet needs a gun
And in the land of plenty
They need a champion
I'm one more of many
Not a lion in the sun
It?s unpopular
To be unpopular
It?s unpopular
To be unpopular
isn't it sad?
The ending won't be a happy one
I'm one more of many
Not a lion in the sunBaby, dance with me slow
Let me fly with you
While the band plays low
Till the night is through
The lights of the candles
Look like stars around the room
I'll try to be careful
But I know I'm not immune
'cause I just can't imagine
How I'd ever come to harm
With this feeling that I'm feeling
As I'm drowning in your arms
Baby, dance with me slow
Till we barely move
Let that crowd rock and roll
While we share this groove
And float like two shadows
In and out and in between
Those faces around us
At the edges of this dream
And it won't even matter
If they stare as we go by
I'm aware of only your love
In this world of you and I
Baby, dance with me slow
Let me fly with you
Let me fly with youI wish the world could feel what we both know is real
Sweetheart you'll always be my ecstasy
You are my dream to share my every hope and care
Sweetheart you'll always be my ecstasy
Your love unveiled the world I'd never known before
When your love fooled inside I softly closed the door
Your heart is tuned with mine in harmony they rhyme
Sweetheart you'll always be my ecstasy
[ ac.guitar ]
Your love unveiled...It was sometime late September
The leaves were gold and green
My baby's eyes were the saddest sight I'd ever seen
Two summers back I loved him
Two years I cried and tried
But I tell you, too many teardrops falling down cannot be dried
It's been a long hard fall
Long hard fall
Long hard fall
So something came between us
A feeling cold as ice
By October there was frost and I knew our love was lost
November made me bitter
As the wind blew through my heart
Oh, so empty in the deepest darkest tiny part
It's been a long hard fall
Long hard fall
Long hard fall
There'd be snow come mid-December
And I'll be frozen to the bone
Oh, but by then it will all be over
It's been a long hard fall
It's been a long hard fall
Long hard fall
Long hard fall
It's been a long hard fall
Long hard fallWe've only known each other since the moment we met
But it seems like forever to me
I haven't figured out the perfect way to say it yet
But I suppose at times like these
A man should get down on his knees
[Chorus]
How'd ya like to be in my wedding?
(And) how'd ya like to walk down the aisle?
You could be the center of attention
Everyone would look at you and smile
We could send our friends invitations
You could wear a long white dress
If you'd like to be in my wedding, darlin'
All ya have to do is say, 'Yes'
Your folks could be seated in the very front row
And cry when we all turn to look at you
We could cut the cake
And we could strike a pose
Like the little, bitty, plastic bride and groom
And then begin our life-long honeymoon
[Chorus]
Tag
Say, 'yes'
Say, 'yes'
(How'd ya like to be in my wedding?)
Please say, 'yes'
(How'd ya like to be in my wedding?)
Say, 'yes'
(How'd ya like to be in my wedding?)
(How'd ya like to be in my wedding?)
(How'd ya like to be in my wedding?)Now, blue ain't the word for the way that I feel,
There's a storm brewin' in this heart of mine.
This ain't no crazy dream, I know that it's real.
You're someone else's love now, you're not mine!
Chorus:
Crazy arms that seek to hold somebody new,
But my burnin' heart keeps sayin' you're not mine!
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed,
And that's why I'm lonely all the time.
Break
Please take these treasured dreams I had for you and me,
And take all the love I thought was mine,
This ain't no crazy dream, I know that it's real,
And that's why I'm lonely all the time!Well I don't care if the sun don't shine I don't care if the bells don't chime
Just as long as you love me
And I don't care if the tops don't spin I don't care if the gins won't gin
Just as long as you love me
So darling let it rain let it snow let the cold north wind blow
Just as long as you love me
North or south east or west you know I will stand the test
Just as long as you love me
Well I don't care if the birds don't sing I don't care if the bells don't ring
Just as long as you love me
I don't care if the world don't turn I don't care if the fire don't burn
Just as long as you love me
So darling let it rain...
Oh darling just as long as you love meIts not the end of the world its not even over
But it will be soon I never learned my lesson
I just changed my tune and no one seems to notice
But you will, you will
Its no big deal
But the last thing I think of when I close my eyes
And the first thing on my mind when I arise
It is a day and you're not really in my life
You can try and you wont find it where you're looking
You can hold it till its putty in your hands
And you cant break a heart that wasn't even yours to break
You can never be there for me in the end
And I will do the right thing I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
You're not fooling me
I'm not the sort of girl that cant see reason
But its nothing that a little bit of time wont heal
I know it don't come easy but I love you, I do
Coming clean
Means never closing curtains I just changed my scene
Oh but you know what I mean and I will learn throughout my life
To never believe what will have been
I can try and I wont find it where I'm looking
I can hold it till its putty in my hands
You cant break a heart that wasn't even yours to break
You can never be there for me in the end
But I will do the right thing I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
I don't think you ever learned a thing from me
But I'm sure that you want me to learn from you
And you've drawn heavy, handed lines around morality
About yourself and I don't share your point of view
Its about time to let you go and I thought its time to let you know
And it has to be the one that you'd regret
I have to say that I'm proud to know you
And ill never be the same because we met
You might not miss this I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I willCan you feel that rush
Makes the whole world hush
Makes your flesh go flush
You break a sweat
Is your soul on fire
With your hearts desire
Out there on the wire
Without a net
Does it take your breath
Are you scared to death
With one kiss we'll be risking it all
If we dance this dance
If we take this chance
We'll be landing in love when we fall
Its an act of God
It's against all odds
And we hold lightening rods
Up in the sky
It's that leap of faith
We all have to take
But hearts don't have to break
When they can fly
Does it take your breath
Are you scared to death
With one kiss we'll be risking it all
If we dance this dance
If we take this chance
We'll be landing in love
One more kiss one more touch
We'll be landing in love when we fallThere's a chill on this evening, nights right for greaving,
Darkness surrounds him as he wanders alone
He walked past the dim lights, the pathways and street lights
They remind him, of nights long ago,
When his love was strong and his muscles hard, His whiskey throat was barley marred,
Seeking misfortune in the lies that he told, Then a brokin heart bought him to his knees,
In the hour of his greatest need, Lost and forsaken by the love, he could not hold
[Chorus:]
On the Border line of love again, Its bound to make you pay
On the Border line, we'll make our stand, Then watch it fall away
And he stands in quiet solitude, The nights reflects upon his mood,
Seeking the vision that had once been so clear, When he felt the touch of his women's love
His pounding heart was warm and young, Now locked inside him with his anger and fear
As he moves on slowly, past the trees, Down the path way home through fallen leaves
He can't believe, how he'd sunken so low, So he learned to live with his injured pride
His purple heart hidden, deep inside, The only reward, for a love he could not holdWho is the biggest fool of the two you for loving me or me for loving you
We were both just out on the town both of us just killing time
When almost before I knew it your lips found their way up to mine
And now here we are doing things we both know we shouldn't do
And darling I wonder just which one of us is the biggest fool of the two
Who is the biggest fool of the two you for loving me or me for loving you
Tomorrow we know we've got to forget this somehow
But in your arms tomorrow seems almost forever from now
But baby you've got another the same as I do
And it all just makes me stop and wonder
Which one of us is the biggest fool of the two
Who is the biggest fool of the two you for loving me or me for loving you
You for loving me or me for loving youAmazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relived
How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed
Through many dangers toils and snares I have already come
Tis grace that has brought me safe thus far and grace will lead me on
When we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun
And than when we first begunLiving below in this old sinful world hardly a comfort can afford
Striving alone to face temptation sore where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go oh where could I go seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to save me in the end where could I go but to the Lord
Life here is grand with friends I love so dear comfort I get from God's own word
Yet when I face the chilling hand of death where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go where could I goYou spurned the love I gave you, darling
A love you once was proud to own
You found someone whom you love better
And in my dreams I walk alone
I'll just pretend that I don't love you
I'll just pretend that I don't care
And when I meet you face to face, dear
I'll turn my head, I'll just pretend
Those happy hours we spent together
Forever in my heart will live
That's all I have for each tomorrow
For we will never meet again
I'll just pretend that I don't love you
I'll just pretend that I don't care
And when I meet you face to face, dear
I'll turn my head, I'll just pretendIf you think, you can depend on me
Your right, you can
If you think, that I'm in love with you
Your right, I am
But nuthin' lasts forever
All good thing's must end
And it's only, a matter, of time
Day after forever
I'm out that door
One way or the other
To return never more
Don't count on me baby
For I will be gone
Day after forever
Honey, you're on your own
If you think, I love you more than life
You're right, I do
If you think, your in my heart and soul
Your right, it's true
But I must leave you someday
Although I worship you
And it's only, a matter, of time
Day after forever
I'm out that door
One way or the other
To return never more
Don't count on me baby
For I will be gone
Day after forever
Honey, you're on your ownThe first time that I stole a song
I changed the words as I sang along
Got a laugh, so I did it again
Gave me a great idea
I changed 'breathe' into 'breath'
Then 'I Shaved My Back' was one of the best
Plowboy got a lot of requests
But I was just getting started
Pretty soon they were suing me
Ended up getting all of the royalties
From every one of those parodies
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
When Toby came out with I Love This Bar
The next day I wrote I Love NASCAR
Sold a half a million at Walmart
It went go-oh-oh-oh-oh-old

I did so good on tour one summer
Came home and bought me Urban's Hummer
Celebrity Fit Club was such a bummer
I hated that show-oh-oh

Row-row-row your boat
Row-oh-oh-oh
Row-row-row your boat
Row-row-row your boat
Row-row-row your boat
Row-oh-oh-ohIt keeps running down the tear-stained face
Of this lonely town and I drown
And I keep reaching for one good reason
Why you said goodbye and turned around
Oh, you're leavin me in this empty state
And all I see are dark clouds as you drive away
Mississippis cryin, baby
Mississippis sad
I think we just figured out
That you aint comin back
The sky can see you leavin
And it cant hold back the tears
Oh, its pourin down and my heart thinks its dyin
Mississippis cryin, Mississippis cryin
The night keeps looking for headlights
Shining in this driveway but they dont shine
And I keep thinkin this crazy storm will
Drive you home but not this time
Oh, my only wish is to change the weather
Are you comin back or is it gonna rain forever?
Mississippis cryin, baby
Mississippis sad
I think we just figured out
That you aint comin back
The sky can see you leavin
And it cant hold back the tears
Oh, its pourin down and my heart thinks its dyin
Mississippis cryin, Mississippis cryin
Where you goin, baby?
Whats in Tennessee?
You never said a word about Memphis
So who is she?
It keeps running down the tear-stained face
Of this lonely town and I drown
Mississippis cryin, baby
Mississippis sad
I think we just figured out
That you aint comin back
The sky can see you leavin
And it cant hold back the tears

Dr. Robert F. Thomas
May his name forever stand
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
Was a mighty, mighty man
And he enriched the lives
Of everyone that ever knew him
And in my song I hope to sing
Some of the praise that's due him
Dr. Thomas was a man
The Lord must have appointed
To live among us mountain folks
In eastern Tennessee
And he delivered more than half
The babies in those mountains
Among those babies
He delivered me
There was no way to drive along
The roads back in those mountains
But Dr. Thomas got there
Just the same
He often rode on horseback
To get where he was needed
But if he had to walk
He always came
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
May his name forever stand
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
Was a mighty, mighty man
And he enriched the lives
Of everyone that ever knew him
And in my song I hope to sing
Some of the praise that's due him
Dr. Thomas was a friend
A neighbor and a doctor
Though he seldom got a dime
For all he'd done
And I remember lots of times
We sent for Dr. Thomas
But I don't recall a time
He didn't come
They say a man is judged
By the deeds he does while livin'
A judgement when he stands
Before the Lord
And I know heaven holds a place
For men like Dr. Thomas
And I know that he'll receive
His just reward
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
May his name forever stand
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
Was a mighty, mighty man
And he enriched the lives
Of everyone that ever knew him
And in my song I hope to sing
Some of the praise that's due himMy first recollection is a day in December
Black iron steam engine covered in ice
Like some Precambrian monster
Moaning and snorting
Nothing was ever going to beat that beast
In a fair fight
I've sat and watched the woodpiles
Grow through the summer
Now I'm sitting, smelling summer burn through the fall
Winter's coming on, days getting dreary
And I'm thinking this is the season
That I leave you all
I've heard a man in crisis
Falls back on what he knows best,
A murderer to murder
A thief to theft
And I don't want you to think
That this is some kind of deathbed confession
But run is what I did when put to the test
My first recollection is a day in December
747 tracing lines through the sky
Like some old gypsy curse
Silently preying upon the dreams of those
Who jealously watch life pass by
I've sat and watched my troubles
Pile through the summer
Now I'm sitting, hearing my youngest cry
Down the hall
Winter's coming on, days getting dreary
And I'm thinking this is the season
That I leave you all
I've heard that the son must bear
The burdens of the father
But it's the daughter that is left
To clean up the mess
And I don't want you to think
That I'm asking for absolution,
But run is what I did when put to the testI will ask for nothing more if you're with me
I'll know what I'm living for if you're with me
I can walk life's many miles every step will be worthwhile
Although weary I'll still smile if you're with me
There's no place that I won't go if you're with me
Through deserts where no flowers grow if you're with me
I'll face up to anything all the worst that life may bring
Through the bad times I'll still sing if you're with me
I will face up to anything...I parked my car 'round back
I've got the shades pulled down
I told everybody including my mama
I was leaving town
But I've been right here
Since you've been gone
Belly-up at the bottom of a bottle
Listening to George Jones
And just playin' possum
Laying low
I've got hundred watts of hurtin'
Coming through the speakers of my stereo
Don't want to see nobody
Nowhere I want to go
I'm just playin' possum
And laying low
I'm gonna hide my heart
And be a love recluse
Oh I could cry on my best friend's shoulder
But there ain't no use
I need an expert on
The pain I'm going through
So I'll keep George on the old turntable
'Til I'm over you
And just playin' possum
Laying low
I've got hundred watts of hurtin'
Coming through the speakers of my stereo
Don't want to see nobody
Nowhere I want to go
I'm just playin' possum
And laying lowWe've decided we can't work it out we might as well call it a day
We agree to disagree and go our seperate ways
We just don't seem to get along we're fightin' and we fuss
So we've agreed to part as friends is best for both of us.
But what's gonna happen to the little folks the little folks the little folks
What's gonna happen to the little folks who live in our house
Since we've decided we can't work it out we might as well ended this time
We fought enough and fussed enough and said too much this time
So we've agreed that the thing to do has set each other free
You'll go your way and I'll go mine that's best for you and me
But what's gonna happen to the little folks...
But maybe someday we'll look back and see how foolish we've been
Cause we might find just the little ones who'd lose in the end
But maybe things are not so bad, we're still in love you and I
And maybe we can work it out if we give it one more try
We owe that much to the little folks, the little folks the little folks
We owe that much to the little folks who live in our house(I want you I need you I love you please grant me this)
One kiss for old time's sake just like it used to be
One kiss for old time's sake could bring you back to me
If you give me a chance to love you one more time
Maybe my lips on yours would change your mind
And you would know how much I want you I need you I love you
Oh my darling please grant me this
One kiss for old time's sake just like it used to be
One kiss for old time's sake could bring you back to me
If there's a spark of love still left from our romance
You owed it to your heart to give me one more chance
Oh can't you see how much I want you I need you I love you
Oh my darling please grant me thisThere must be something fishy goin' on
You said you were goin' on a fishing trip with some old friend
You said that you'd be home tonight somewhere around ten
Well here it is it's two o'clock and you're still not at home
I think there's something fishy goin' on
I think that I'm a sucker that's swallowing your line
I try to make myself believe that it's all in my mind
But you never ask me if I'd like to go along so there must be something fishy goin' on
There's something fishy goin' on on these fishing trips you're goin' on
I'm gettin' tired of staying home alone
Some night when you come home and discover that I'm gone
You can bet there's something fishy goin' on
I guess some large-mouth bass left that lipstick on your shirt
I don't think you're a fisherman honey I think you're a flirt
Well if you're goin' fishing then why don't you bring them home
I think there's something fishy goin' on
here's something fishy goin' on...
Yes you can bet there's something fishy goin' onI saw the light I saw the light no more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight praise the Lord I saw the light
I wandered so aimless life filled with sin I wouldn't let my dear Saviour in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night and praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light
Just like a blind man I wandered along worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like a blind man God gave back his sight praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light
I was a fool to wander and stray straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light
I saw the lightTake me,take me

An' Lisa left you years ago
My eyes are not blue but mine won't leave you
'Til the sunlight has touched your face
She was your morning light
Her smile told of no night
An' your love for her grew
With each rising sun
And then one winter day his hand led hers away
An' she left you here drowning in your tears
Here where you've stayed for years
Cryin', "Lisa, Lisa"
I'm not Lisa an' my name is Julie
An' Lisa left you years ago
An' my eyes are not blue but mine won't leave you
'Til the sunlight shines through your facewritten by Mosie Lister
Once I stood in the night with my head bowed low
In the darkness as black as could be
And I felt so alone and I cried oh Lord don't hide your face from me
Hold my hand all the way every hour every day
From here to the great unknown
Take my hand and let me stand where no one stands alone
[ steel ]
Like a king I may live in a palace so high with great riches to call all my own
But I don't know a thing in this whole wide world that's worse than being alone
Hold my hand all the way...

No one knows shes got the blues
A man alone
Singing her song
Like mockingbirds do
Hangin' on mind to the ground
Ain't nothin' gonna bring her down
Its just her and the sky
She doesn't ask why
So I do you
Worry, ain't no need to worry
She ain't in a hurry no

Shes needs to be
Worry, ain't no need to worry
She ain't in a hurry no

Now you're putting on the style
And you never once looked back
At your home across the track
You're the gossip of the town
But my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it on the ground
Pick me up on your way down
Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When the glamor starts to boar you
Come on back where you belong
You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
When they take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down
Well, they've changed your attitude
Made you haughty and so rude
But underneath, you're still the same
Hey, I know they're to blame
If you find these thing are true
I'll be waiting here for you
As you tumble to the ground
Pick me up on your way down
Yeah, pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When the glamor starts to boar you
Come on back where you belong
You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
When they take away your crown
Pick me up on your way downAnother paper in my front yard
Another wave at the crossing guard
Parking lot spot 29
Ain't nothin' different but the car next to mine
And I let that song on the radio fade before I ever open the door
And it's a Xerox copy, identical twin of the 24 hours before
[Chorus]
Baby in the meantime
In the in-between time
All I do is think about you
Just another hey, hey
Weekends on the way, hey
Just another Monday
And a Tuesday nothin' left to lose day
Wednesday and a Thursday look just like the first day
Friday night to Sunday all roll into one day
Just another day without you, ah baby
It ain't Cheers but they all know my name
A coke can, a beer can, it's all the same
I always leave at 11:03
I know what's good and what's bad for me
I could roll thru this routine in my sleep if only I could sleep at all
And the news and the weather say, it's gonna get better but not if you never call

Baby in the meantime
In the in-between time
All I do is think about you

No, no, noI'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on
I've traveled around this country crossed the waters deep and wide
Made lots of friends and memories brought joy to other's lives
It's Christmas time again another year has come and gone
And I can't keep from wonderin' how the old folks are at home
I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on
When the snow is on the meadow and the sleigh bells jingle bright
And the kids are singing jingle bells around the Christmas lights
As daddy stokes the fire and mama puts the turkey on
There ain't nothing going to slow me down this Christmas I'll be home
I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells onWriter: Doug Supernaw
I should take it like a man
And go and shake his hand
But what I saw today
On the wedding page
Was more than I could stand
All I could do was stare
At you pictured there
You were a lovely sight
All dressed up in white
With flowers in your hair
It should have been me
Wearin' tux and tails
But I never got my initation in the mail
The least you could have done
Was to have me by your side
'Cause I was the one
That gave away the bride
Well I'll bet your dad was proud
When he walked you through the crowd
Walking down the aisle
With his only child
To hear her wedding vows
And when the preacher said
Who gives you to be wed
Did your dad say there were three
Or did he forget me
Like I guess you did[Chorus]
Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little lord Jesus laid down his sweet head
The stars in the sky look down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay
The cattle all glory the baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes
I love the Lord Jesus look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle till morning is ney.
[Chorus]
Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little lord Jesus laid down his sweet head
The stars in the sky look down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.He had plastic bags wrapped round his shoes
He was covered with the evening news
Had a pair of old wool socks on his hands
The bank sign was flashing "5 below
It was freezing rain an spittin' snow
He was curled up behind some garbage cans
I was afraid that he was dead
I gave him a gentle shake
When he opened up his eyes
I said,"Old man are you ok?"
He said,"I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree"
I was runin' from some honey bees
Drip dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
Cause I was almost home
Then he said,"I was comin' round the barn"
Bout the time he grabbed my arm
When I heard Momma holler son hurry up
I was close enough for my own nose
To smell fresh cobbler on the stove
When I saw daddy loadin' up the truck
Cane poles on the tailgate
Bobbers blowin' in the wind
Since July of '55
That's as close as I've been
He said,"I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree"
I was runin' from some honey bees
Drip dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
Cause I was almost home
I said,"old man you're gonna freeze to death"
Let me drive you to a mission
He said,"Boy if you left me alone
Right now I'd be fishin'
He said,"I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree"
I was runin' from some honey bees
Drip dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
Cause I was almost home
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
Cause I was almost home (Almost Home)
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
I wish almost homeThings don't always work out like you plan
But you can't let that hold you back from tryin' again
I've been fallin' for you, you need not fear
I've got this propsition I think you should hear
Consider this, living life together
Consider this, seeing the world
Consider this, building a home of our own, a front porch, picket fence and 3 kids
Girl you and I we can't miss
Consider this
Consider this
Everyday is a new day, take it as it comes
Theres a world out there waiting so seize it and run
You've got nothin' to lose, and everything to gain
Won't you please consider what my heart has to say
Consider this, living life together
Consider this, seeing the world
Consider this, building a home of our own, a front porch, picket fence and 3 kids
Girl you and I we can't miss
Consider this
We can watch every sunset
Every storm roll in over the shore
Through the good and the bad girl we'll have our love
This could be everything you've dreamed of and more
Consider this, living life together
Consider this, seeing the world
Consider this, building a home of our own, a front porch, picket fence and 3 kids
Girl you and I we can't miss
Consider this
Consider this
Consider this.. seein the world
Consider this.. buildin a home
Consider this.. a front porch, picket fence
Consider this.. 3 kids
Consider this.. maybe 2 kids
Consider this.. every sunset
Consider this.. every stormI know what you`ve been waiting for
A little love and happiness
The truth in front of you, so hard to ignore
All you need is tenderness
So drop the Norma Jean
I ain't no James Dean
Just let it flow, no need to fake it, babe
We can make it babe, if we just let it go
It's only natural, baby
You and me dancing close
This could be love
You never know
Just take my hand now, baby
We can move it out on the floor
This could be the love that you've waited for
Don't sit around and dream
Let's do the natural thing
You`re thinking, maybe I'm just breaking the rules
By coming on a little strong
But I got information you can use
Do lighten up and play along
Let`s have a wing ding, a little spring thing
Don`t tell me no
I don`t want no wedding ring, ain`t rushing anything
Just let the good times roll
It's only natural, baby
You and me dancing close
This could be love
You never know
Just take my hand now, baby
We can move it out on the floor
This could be the love that you've waited for
Don't sit around and dream
Let's do the natural thing
So drop the Norma Jean
I ain't no James Dean
Just let it flow, no need to fake it, babe
We can make it babe, if we just let it go
It's only natural, baby
You and me dancing close
This could be love
You never know
Just take my hand now, baby
We can move it out on the floor
This could be the love that you've waited for
Don't sit around and dream
Let's do the natural thingI took all my pictures of you and I,
Threw them all away
I drank down that bottle of wine said that we,
Swore we would save
For some special occasion,
Some big moment somewhere down the line
Tonight I'm celebrating,
The first day of the rest of my life
[Chorus]
Like a storm,
Like a train,
Like the seasons when they change.
Like the dark of night does every day at dawn
Like the air,
That I breathe after it rose out of me
It goes off to find another home
My heart move on
I put a for sale sign on my car and I,
Parked it outside
'Cause that backseat reminds me of our,
Very first time
I don't need any memories,
Hanging around this old place
Sturring up that stuff in me,
That will only get in my way
[Chorus]I just want to be somebody's everything.
You say I've seen too many movies, watched too much TV,
Read too many fairy tales that I live and make believe.
You say the kind of love I'm dreamin' of does not exist.
And there's no one like I'm searchin' for, well, I believe there is.
And I want someone to come alive when they lay eyes on me,
Have a lust within their touch, a passion fire beyond belief.
Reality and fantasy should be one in the same
And I want to be somebody's everything.
I refuse to settle for something less than great.
And if it takes a lifetime, then that's how long I'll wait.
'Cause all I want is everything, is that too much to ask?
Have romance, love and passion; find magic that will last.
And I want someone to think they'll die if they can't be with me.
I want to be their joy, their pride, their dreams,
The very air they breathe.
I want to wake up feelin' loved and go to bed the same.
Yes, I want to be somebody's everything, somebody's everything.
Oh, I want someone to come alive when they lay eyes on me.
Have a lust within their touch, a passion fire beyond belief.
I'd love to wake up feelin' loved and go to bed the same.
Yes, I want to be somebody's everything.
Someone to hold me close and tremble when the lovin's done.
Think it's heaven, call me angel, think I hung the moon and sun.
Get misty eyed just knowin' with a love song people sing.
Yes, I want to be somebody's everything.
And I'm gonna be somebody's everything,
somebody's everything.
I want to be, I'm gonna be somebody's everything.
I want to be, I want to be somebody's everything,
Somebody's everything, somebody's everything
Somebody's everything, somebody's everything
Yes I want to be, I'm gonna be somebody's everything
I want to be, I'm gonna be, I wanna be somebody's everythingTommy's daddy kept a six pack in the fridge
We thought we were old enough to do what daddy's did.
It didn't take us long to go from drunk to really sick
When I walked in my house I stumbled just a bit.
You play it cool but its no use,
Dad ain't no fool and that's the truth
Chewing gum won't cover up that smell
You can't hide one single thought
If you try you'll just get caught
When somebody knows you that well.
We lost daddy in 1999
I took care of everybody's pain, except for mine,
Then one night my wife took my face in her hands
She said, Ã¢??I think its time you cry for your old man."
You play it cool but its no use
She ain't no fool and that's the truth
and my tear drops finally fell,
You can't hide one single thought
If you try you'll just get caught
When somebody knows you that well.
I could probably do more to help my fellow man,
But life gets busy and I hope God understands
Someday when I get time, I'll do more than my share,
Funny how I'm thinkin' it sittin' in my easy chair,
You play it cool but its no use,
God ain't no fool and that's the truth,
And he won't let you fool yourself,
You can't hide one single thought,
If you try you'll just get caught
When somebody knows you that well.
When somebody knows you that wellCrying holy unto the Lord
Crying holy unto the Lord
Oh, if I could I surely would
Stand on the rock where Moses stood
Sinners, run and hide your face
Sinners, run and hide your face
Go and run into the rocks and hide your face
The rocks got no hiding place
Crying holy unto the Lord
Crying holy unto the Lord
Oh, if I could I surely would
Stand on the rock where Moses stood
Lord, I ain't no sinner now
Lord, I ain't no sinner now
I've been to the river and I've been baptized
And I ain't no sinner now
Crying holy unto the Lord
Crying holy unto the Lord
Oh, if I could I surely would
Stand on the rock where Moses stood
Lord, I ain't no stranger now
Lord, I ain't no stranger now
I've been introduced to the Father and the Son
And I ain't no stranger now
Crying holy unto the Lord
Crying holy unto the Lord
Oh, if I could I surely would
Stand on the rock where Moses stoodWhen I cross over
I will shout and sing
I will know my savior
By the mark where the nails have been
[Chorus]
By the mark where the nails have been
By the sign upon his precious skin
I will know my savior when I come to him
By the mark where the nails have been
A man of riches
May claim a crown of jewels
But the king of heaven
Can be told from the prince of fools
[Chorus]
On Calvary Mountain
Where they made him suffer so
All my sin was paid for
A long, long time ago
[Chorus]When life gets you down
What you gonna do?
x2
Are you gonna stick your head in the sand?
Are you gonna turn and run just like that?
Are you gonna take a fall or a stand today?
When hearts break you down
What you gonna do?
x2
Are you gonna pitch a fight and cry?
Are you gonna beg the reasons why?
Are you gonna say and do what's wrong or right?
Well you could always love me
Yeah you can always love me
Yeah you could always love me
And if it don't feel right
At least you tried
When I let you down
What you gonna do?
x2
Are you gonna slip away in the night?
Are you gonna hold the babies tight?
Are you gonna give me more of your maybes and mights?
Well you can always love me
You could always love me x2
And if it don't feel right
At least you tried
You could always love me
And if it don't feel right
At least you tried
But did you try?I just came down from Chippewa
Had as station wagon and a hundred dollars
Thinking about the girl I'd lost a year before
I hadn't seen her for some time
Thought I might go on by when your memory came flooding in and you closed that door.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it didnt have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train.
Well every time I talk to you I hear your jealous lines
I feel like I've been left abandoned on some old railway side
And every time I hear your voice my water just gets cold
My stoker will not stoke and my boiler will not boil.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it didnt have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train.
Well every time I fell behind I could not get ahead
I wish someone would pull the lever and give me a little sand
And every time I slip behind even further back
I wish some switch man would come out of the fog and change my track.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it didnt have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it didnt have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train.The years creep slowly by Lorena snow is on the grass again
The sun is sinking low Lorena frost is where the flowers have been
The music softly plays Lorena happy sounds have left today
The music's sad and low Lorena where once it rang so loud and gay
I hardly feel the snow Lorena I know the darkness soon will pass
We'll sing our songs again Lorena you'll be in my arms at last
Yes you'll be in my arms at lastCould been better for us both had we never
In this wide and wicked world had never met
Why the pleasures we both seemed together
I am sure love I'll never forget
Oh I'm thinking tonight of my blues eyes
Who is sailing all over the sea
Oh I'm thinking tonight of her only
And I wonder if she ever thinks of me
[ fiddle ]
Oh you told me once dear that you love me
And you said that we never would part
But a linking the chain has been broken
Leaving me with a sad and aching heart
Oh I'm thinking tonight...
[ steel ]
When the cold cold grave shall inclose me
Won't you come dear and shed just one tear
And say to the strangers around you
Of your heart you have broken last year
Oh I'm thinking tonight...I wonder if there's anyone remembers me in my hometown
I wonder what the folks would say if I wandered in and just moseyd around
I wonder if they look at me and say what's your name haven't we met before
To me it would seem like a beautiful dream to be in my hometown
[ guitar ]
I'd like to see the little house where I was born in my hometown
I'd like to wade the creek again and see where I hid all the treasures I'd found
I wanna just remember all the places I knew when I was a kid
Oh to me it would seem like a beautiful dream to be in my hometownI was raised knowin' right from wrong
Baptized under that ol' rugged cross
I try to be a good man, I always give it my best
But truth be told, some days, I wanna go
To the wild, wild west
I wanna line 'em up and drink 'em
I wanna love 'em and leave 'em
Sometimes, I just wanna rob a train
Be the first draw in that high noon sun
And feel the kick of my six gun
Yeah, I want "Wanted" above my name
Sometimes, I wanna be like Jesus
Sometimes, I wanna be Jesse James
I know where to draw the line
But there's somethin' 'bout that other side
I've got angels on my left, and demons on my right
It's a never endin' battle, it's a constant fight
I wanna line 'em up and drink 'em
I wanna love 'em and leave 'em
Sometimes, I just wanna rob a train
Be the first draw in that high noon sun
And feel the kick of my six gun
Yeah, I want "Wanted" above my name
Sometimes, I wanna be like Jesus
Sometimes, I wanna be Jesse James
I wanna steal a horse and ride into town
Stare the sheriff down
Tell him there's a new man around here
I wanna walk throught those swingin' saloon doors
And hear my spurs hit the wooden floor
I wanna smell nothin' but fear
Y'hear, law don't go 'round here
I wanna line 'em up and drink 'em
I wanna love 'em and leave 'em
Sometimes, I just wanna rob a train
Be the first draw in that high noon sun
And feel the kick of my six gun
Yeah, I want "Wanted" above my name
Sometimes, I wanna be like Jesus
Sometimes, I wanna be Jesse James
Y'hear that, law dog
Law don't go around hereDon't look so sad I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that were burning
Lay your head upon my pillow hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time for the good times (for the good times)
I'll get along you'll find another and I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
Lay your head upon my pillowThey've read the scriptures, they've passed the plate
They've sung the anthem, they've passed the plate
And we're both prayin' he don't preach late
But he's gettin' amens, that's just our luck
It's eighty five degrees outside and he's just gettin' warmed up
And you and me, we could be soakin' up that sun
Findin' out just how fast your brother's boat will run
I'll tell you there ain't nothin' that'll test your faith
Like a long sermon on a pretty sunday
Well it's been rainin' all week long
Woke up this mornin', dark clouds were gone
We both been raised not to miss church
But on a day like today heaven knows how much it hurts
And you and me, we could be soakin' up that sun
Findin' out just how fast your brother's boat will run
I'll tell you there ain't nothin' that'll test your faith
Like a long sermon on a pretty sunday
See that sunlight shinin' through that stained glass
How much longer is this gonna last
And you and me, we could be soakin' up that sun
Findin' out just how fast your brother's boat will run
I'll tell you there ain't nothin' that'll test your faith
Like a long sermon on a pretty sundayOpen up your heart and let my love come in open up your heart and let my life begin
The sun's gonna shine there'll be blue skies again
When you open up your heart and let my love come in
I know you've been hurt by an old love affair
But darling don't blame me I wasn't even there
Your long lonely nights I will bring to an end
When you open up your heart and let my love come in
Open up your heart...
Someone before me has treated you like dirt
Someone before me has made your heart hurt
Your long lonely nights I will bring to an end
When you open up your heart and let my love come in
Open up your heart...
When you open up your heart and let my love come inFolk always told me that my heart would grow
The older the man, yeah, the stronger the stone
Am I losing my mind?
Am I growing backwards with time?
Some say with age that a purpose comes clear
I see the opposite happening here
Are we losing the fight?
Are we growing backwards with time?
I was young and love was fun
Now it's so serious
Now all the fun has equal pain
There's something wrong with this
For all I know there's more I don't
Oh the little I have learned
For every year of knowledge gained
Is a negative year I've earned
Folk always told me that my heart would grow
The older the man, yeah, the stronger the stone
Am I losing my mind?I went to see the preacher, to teach me how to pray
He looked at me and smiled, then that preacher turned away
Said, "If you want to tell him something, you ain't gotta fold your hands.
Say it with your heart, your soul, and believe it, and I'll say, Amen."
Bang a drum for the sinners, bang a drum for your sins
Bang a drum for the losers and those who win
Bang a drum, bang it loudly, or as soft as you need
Bang a drum for yourself son, and a drum for me
Well I called upon my brother, just the other day
He said, "Jon, I'm gonna die if I don't start to live again.
I work each day and night like clockwork, just tryin' to make ends meet.
Well I could kick this bad world's ass if I could just get on my feet."
Bang a drum for the dying, bang a drum for the truth
Bang a drum for the innocence, lost in our youth
Bang a drum, bang it loudly, or as soft as you need
Bang a drum for your brother, and a drum for me
I don't know where all the rivers run
I don't know how far, I don't know how come
But I'm gonna die believin, with each step that I take
Ain't worth the ground that I walk if we don't walk it our own way
I don't claim to be a wise man, a poet, or a Saint
Just another man who's searchin' for a better way
But my heart beats loud as thunder, for the things that I believe
Sometimes I want to run for cover, sometimes I want to scream
Bang a drum for the tomorrow, bang a drum for the past
Bang a drum for heroes, who won't come back
Bang a drum for the promise, bang a drum for the lies
Bang a drum for the lovers, and the tears they cry
Bang a drum bang it loudly, or as soft as you need
But as long as my heart keeps on banging, I've got a reason to believePiercing words, eyes are red
Watched your taillights in the rain
Empty heart filled with regret
I know we were both to blame
And I'm not sorry that it's over
But for the way we let it end
So I said all I had to say
In letters that I threw away
And you should know, please believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number, but it's been so long
It's never easy, it's like tryin' to spin the world the other way
What can I say?
How did it come to this?
I think about you all the time
It's no excuse, but I wish
That I never made you cry
I'm not sorry that it's over
But for the way we let it end
I couldn't find the words to say
And you should know, please believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number, but it's been so long
It's never easy, it's like tryin' to spin the world the other way
So what can I say? What can I say?
What can I say? What can I say?
I hate to think all you had of me
(I said all I had to say)
Is a memory I left you, space between what was meant to be
(In letters that I threw away)
And the mess that it turned into
And you should know, please believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number, but it's been so long
It's never easy, it's like tryin' to spin the world the other way
It's like tryin' to spin the world the other way
What can I say? What can I say?
What can I say?You put a whole lot of lonesome in me can't you see
You gave me a forest then burnt down the trees
You preached me a sermon until I believed
Then you put a whole lot of lonesome in me
I just wanted someone to take me you took me for all that you could
My friends all said you'd try to break me from drinkin'
But I never thought that you would Tammy
You put a whole lot of lonesome in me can't you see
I bought you that mansion you wanted so much but it never quite felt like home
The dreams that we once shared are shattered in two
And I've had to go on alone Tammy
You put a whole lot of lonesome in me can't you see
Yes I've got a whole lot of lonesome in meTaking chances with this heart each time I hold you
Afraid I might be going too far
Taking chances with these lips each time I tell you
Oh you're the one that I've been waiting for
Someone else is still on your mind
But I'll take a chance that I'll win in time
Knowing I might lose when you got to choose
But yet I stay around just taking chances
Someone else is still on your mind...Bows and flows of angel hair and ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere, I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun they rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done, but clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels the dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real, I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show, you leave 'em laughin' when you go
And if you care don't let them know, don't give yourself away
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud, to say, "I love you" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds, I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange they shake their heads, they say
I've changed
But something's lost but something's gained in living every day
I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at allJust follow the stairway to this lonely world of mine
You'll find me waiting here in Apartment No 9
Not so very long ago you walked away from me
And after all the plans we made you decided to be free
Loneliness surrounds me without your arms around me
And the sun will never shine in Apartment No 9
[ piano - steel ]
I'll keep waiting in this lonely room just in case you change your mind
You'll find me waiting here in apartment No 9
Loneliness surrounds me...
And the sun will never shine in Apartment No 9A candle burning for everything I've ever wanted
A tattoo burned for everything I've ever wanted and lost
I had a long list of names that I kept in my back pocket,
But I've cut it down to one and your name's at the top
Won't you share a common disaster?
Share with me a common disaster
A common disaster
I found myself a friend,
But he's crooked as a stick in water
So now I'm writing fairy tales
To catch the spirit of revenge
He's got a plan to steal my little sister,
But I'm not too concerned
'Cause I will get him in the end
Won't you share a common disaster?
Share with me a common disaster
A common disaster
Going to find me someone to share
A common disaster
Run away with me from a life so cramped and dull
Not worry too much about the happily-ever-after
Just keep the Caddy moving
'Til we're well beyond that hill
Won't you share a common disaster?
Share with me a common disaster
A common disaster(C.W. McCall, Bill Fries, Chip Davis)
Write me a song about singin'
Write me a song about free
Do a little tune about lovin' and a-livin'
Do it just for me
[Chorus]
But please don't make it a sad song
I don't wanna sing the blues
For god's sakes make it a glad song
I got no time to lose
Now, write me a song about rivers
Write me a song about trees
Do a little tune about climbin' the mountain
Play it in the key of me
[Chorus]
But please don't make it a sad song
I don't wanna sing the blues
For god's sakes make it a glad song
I got no time to lose
Lay a little get-down rhythm
Sprinkle in a dash a' soul
Mix it with a little bit a' breakdown country
Plus a lot a' Rock an' roll
[Chorus]
But please don't make it a sad song
I don't wanna sing the blues
For god's sakes make it a glad song
I got no time to lose
Well, write me a song about summer
Write me a song about sun
Do a little tune about good times
Do it just for fun
[Chorus]
But please don't make it a sad song
I don't wanna sing the blues
For god's sakes make it a glad song
I got no time to loseHe may give you diamonds on your birthday
And send you flowers now and then
He may put a new car in your driveway
Take you places you ain't ever been
He'll make you think that you're his one and only
But there's a big surprise in store for you
'Cause that man has an eye for every woman
Except for the one he's married to
You're gonna wish you were still the other woman
You're the one who hears his alibis
And if you think you can keep him home
You got another thing comin'
'Cause there will always be
The other woman
You had best be watchin' every minute
'Cause someday he's gonna cross that line
It's been your game, but I'm about to win it
'Cause now the problems are yours instead of mine
So while you're livin' on all those promises he made you
I'll be havin' all the good times that you'll miss
And the day he don't come home and make love to ya
Is when you'll know he's had enough of wedding bliss
You're gonna wish you were still the other woman
You're the one who hears his alibis
And if you think you can keep him home
You got another thing comin'
'Cause there will always be
The other woman
You're gonna wish you were still the other woman
You're the one who hears his alibis
And if you think you can keep him home
You got another thing comin'
'Cause there will always be
The other woman
And if you think you can keep him home
You got another thing comin'
'Cause there will always be
The other woman
The other womanLivin' on your love livin' on your love livin' on your love day by day
Livin' on your love livin' on your love I'm livin' on your love all the way
You may find another love outside my world
But you'll always have me taggin' at your sleeve
I need all the love you give to go on livin'
So darling keep this thought in mind each time you leave
That I'm livin' on your love...
[ ac.guitar ]
You don't have to lie and say how much you love me
I'm so blind I quest anything you say
I'll just feel my heart excuses when you hurt me
And if I see the truth I'd look the other way
Cause I'm livin' on your love...
I'm livin' on your love all the wayIn the presence of you I wonder
Why I can't say the things that I want to
All the pretty words that I planned to say when I'm with you
I lose them in the presence of you
Your nearness makes my voice tremble
There's a weakness that I feel through and through
Searching for words to describe how I love you
Don't come easy in the presence of you
Love and admiration might make my words silent
But feelings say more than words do
And the feeling of loving you is all around me
Anytime I'm in the presence of you
Love and admiration might make my words silent...The boss needs me to come to work
In the morning, he told me so
My landlord needs me to pay
My rent or out I go
The parakeet needs me
To teach him a song
The puppy dog needs me
To bring him a bone
Everybody needs me
But something's wrong
That ain't the kinda needin' I need, baby
Ain't the kinda needin' I need
I need love, your kind of love
Tender warm and sweet
I need your lips to kiss me
And tell me I'm your man
Talk to me in the language of love
That's all I understand
And that's the kinda needin' I need
My next door neighbor needs me
To help him paint his fence
The kid with the bird and beads
Needs me to talk him some sense
The sailboat needs me to find some wind
Sail it up and down the water again
And you need me just to be your friend
And that ain't the kinda needin' I need, baby
Ain't the kinda needin' I need
That's the kinda needin' I need, baby
Ain't the kinda needin' I need
That's the kinda needin' I need, baby
Ain't the kinda needin' I needSaviour again to Thy dear name we raise with one accord our parting hymn of praise
Once more we bless Thee ere our worship cease
Then lowly bending wait Thy word of peace
(Grant us Thy peace upon our homeward way
With Thee began with Thee shall end the day)
Guard Thou the lips from sin the hearts from shame
That in this house have called upon Thy name
[ strings ]
Grant us Thy peace throughout our earthly life
Our balm in sorrow and our stay in strife
Then when Thy voice shall bid our conflict cease
Call us oh Lord to Thine eternal peace amenWhat a friend we have in Jesus all our sins and grieves to bear
What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer
Oh what peace we often forfeit of what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry everything to God in prayerThere's a place they call The Bottom,
And friends! I've been there once or twice.
It's dark down there and lonely,
And something's missin' in your life.
Tonight I thought I'd had enough,
When I heard a voice said, "Don't give up!"
That whisper had an old familiar ring
I didn't see the angel, but I felt the comfort of her wing.
Daddy always called her angel,
I never knew the reason why.
I was looking for a halo
He was looking in her eye.
She was always there to guide me
With all the love a gentle hand could bring.
I didn't see the angel,
But I felt the comfort of her wing.
Now I'm looking back in time
To a young man stumbling through the kitchen door.
How Mama kept on praying
When she couldn't tell me nothing any more.
I woke up in my bed again,
I guess she must have tucked me in
I can't remember much of any thing.
I didn't see the angel, but I felt the comfort of her wing.
Daddy always called her angel,
I never knew the reason why.
I was looking for a halo
He was looking in her eye.
She was always there to guide me
With all the love a gentle hand could bring.
I didn't see the angel,
But I felt the comfort of her wing.
Now that's why Lord made her an angel.
I feel the comfort of her wingI've been lonesome,
I've been empty
I got an achin',
Way down inside
I need someone,
Someone to hold me
Pull down the shade,
Turn out the light
And love me tonight.
Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door.
I need you so now
Come on let's go now
Kick off your shoes,
Turn out the light
And love me tonight.
Now don't you worry
We're all alone now
Let your hair down
Sit by my side
Turn off the T.V.
Put on some music
Pull down the shade
Turn out the light
And love me tonight
Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door.
I need you so now
Come on let go now
Kick off your shoes
Turn out the light
And love me tonightHoney, if you only knew
What I've the will to do
Endure or take
All for love's sake
Baby, there'd be no denyin'
Any sacrifice that
I'm prepared to make
All for love's sake
As evidence, I offer up my heart
Begging you to use every last part
Baby, I'll stand shielding you
Any it hurt quick to pursue
Each blades embrace
All for love's sake
As evidence, I offer up my heart
Begging you to use every last part
Honey, if you only knew
What I've the will to do
Endure or take
All for love's sake
Baby, there'd be no denyin'
Any sacrifice that
I'm prepared to make
All for love's sake
As evidence, I offer up my heart
Begging you to use every last part
For love's sake
For love's sake
For love's sake
For love's sake
For love's sake
For love's sakeCoutin' the hours countin' the days till I'll be back in your arms to stay
I left Lake Charleston on 72 and I drove the Highway 10
Took a ride at a second light and I turn back right again
Drove till I came to the junction 6 went to the transit 5-0-1
Stopped for gas at the Cumberland pass and dinned in Burlington
Coutin' the hours countin' the days till I'll be back in your arms to stay
[ guitar ]
Now out of Burlington I took old 70 headed west
I found me a picnic table and stratched out and I took a rest
I drove on across Montana dam till I came to Lake Awhoo
Took the prairie to the other side I was a coming home to you
Coutin' the hours countin' the days till I'll be back in your arms to stay
Coutin' the hours countin' the days till I'll be back in your arms to stayJust like an angel you came to me out of a clear blue sky
And knowin' I saw you I fell in love out of a clear blue sky
Like a bowl of lightning you struck my heart
Then old people gave me a shot with the flame and dark
And when I knew dreams can't come true out of a clear blue sky
[ guitar - steel ]
Just like an angel you came to me...
Out of a clear blue skyIf I could see you just one time
Oh how it'd ease my troubled mind
If I could hold you just one time
And then pretend that you're still mine
[Chorus]
Oh, how I miss you so
Oh I need you so
I'd give this heart of mine
If I could see you just one time
Lips that used to thrill me so
They now thrill someone else I know
Gone is the love that once was mine
Wish I could see you just one time
[Chorus]
Wish I could relive just one time
Turn back the pages and there I'd find
That same old love that once was mine
Wish I could see you just one time
[Chorus]I come from the heart of the Heartland
Where pictures shows where the corn grows
In rows and rows of summer greens
And winter snows
And it goes on
Through the crack of the bat
Oh everybody rollin' out their welcome mat
And our hands on our heart under the stars of the Friday night flag
And oh the heart will wander
Beyond that wild blue yonder
When I get lost in the noise like a whisper I hear the voice of the boy
Oh from Illinois
I remember the first time
I saw that name on the marquee sign
Lights so bright could almost make you blind
I'd get lost in
Sweet girls singin' along
Buses rollin' on in the silver dawn
Seein' the world a long, long way from home
And oh the heart will wander
Beyond that wild blue yonder
When I get lost in the noise like a whisper I hear the voice of the boy
Oh from Illinois
It's water through my blood
It's the place I got my roots
It's the fire that's in my soul
It's the mud that's on my boots
Oh Illinois
And oh the heart will wander
Beyond that wild blue yonder
When I get lost in the noise like a whisper I hear the voice of the boy
Oh from Illinois
from Illinois
Oh, oh, Illinois
Takes me back, Illinois
Take me home, take me home, take me home
I come from the heart of the Heartland, IllinoisRoses are red my love violets are blue
Sugar is sweet my love but not as sweet as you
A long long time ago on graduation day
You handed me your book I signed this way
Roses are red my love
We dated through school and when the big day came
I wrote into your book next to my name
Roses are red my love
Then I went far away and you found someone new
I read your letter dear and I wrote back to you
Roses are red my love violets are blue
Sugar is sweet my love good luck may God bless you
Is that your little girl she looks a lot like you
Some day some boy will write in her book too
Roses are red my loveI, I been gone I been gone too long singing my songs on the road.
Another town, one more show and I'm coming home.
Don't give a damn what these keys I hold
I'm gonna knock down that front door, and
I'ma find out what that house is made of.
Been too many nights since its felt us make love.
I wanna rock some Sheetrock, knock some pictures off the wall.
Love you baby, like a wrecking ball.
You, look at you send me one more shot sitting on a bathroom sink.
Damn you really turn me on, painting your toenails pink.
Easy baby before you say but if I can make it just one more day, and
That old house is gonna be shaking.
I hope those bricks and boards can take it.
But I won't be surprised if the whole damn place just falls.
I'm gonna rock you baby, like a wrecking ball.I guess I'm just the fool they call me
For loving you the way I do.
But, I would rather be a fool dear
Than be so lonely without you.
[Chorus]
They tell me that a fool can't miss love.
They tell me that a fool don't know.
But, if I had to live without you
I'd rather be a fool than go.
I guess I'll stay the fool they call me
For without you there's nothing left.
But, I would rather be a fool love,
Than be so lonely by myself.
[Chorus]He's got a fuzzy white beard 'neath a great big smile
A bright red hat you could see for a mile
A bag full of goodies and a great big grin
Here comes Santa Claus, again
All year he been a workin' and a buildin' toys
All for the good little girls and boys
He come down the chimney with the great big grin
Here comes Santa Claus, again
[Bridge]
He's got little toy soldiers, all red and blue
A lots of little vowels that say I love you
A dress for mama and a pipe for dad
Santa sure makes a lotta people feel glad
[Chorus]
So hang your stockings, and go to bed
Say your prayers and cover your head
And while you're sleeping his fun begins
Here comes Santa Claus, again
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
Santa Claus is here, againYou know I'm stubborn, set in my ways, said I'd never
Fall in love, used all the old cliches
But just now when you called and my heart rate hit the roof
I realized it's time to eat my words and face the truth
So come on over tonight we'll sit on the swing
Watch the pigs fly by flappin' their brand new wings
Just sit back and relax and watch me eat my hat
While the oak trees sprout dollar bills
And I look you in the eye
To finally say the words I swore I'd never say
In my whole life
So come on over tonight
I called my buddies, they're comin' too
After the way I ran my mouth they can't
Believe it's true
They're bringin' pizza and sweet tea
And I hope that you don't mind
But they said they've gotta see this
And they promise to be quiet
So come on over tonight we'll sit on the swing
Watch the pigs fly by flappin' their brand new wings
Just sit back and relax and watch me eat my hat
While a big ol' bolt of lightning
Strikes me not just once, but twice
As I say the words I swore I'd never say
In my whole life
Yeah, come on over tonight
Me fallin' in love, that's one of those things
That I swore would never come true
But I'm startin' to think that nothin' is impossible now
That I found you, nothin'
Yeah, come on over tonight we'll sit on the swing
Watch the pigs fly by flappin' their brand new wings
Just sit back and relax and watch me eat my hat
See the premiere performance of demons on ice
As I say the words I swore I'd never say
In my whole life
Say, come on over
Hey, come on over
Said, come on over tonightWell there she goes she hardly knows the heart she's breaking
I spoke to her that I don't think she understood
So just forget about the plans that you were making heart we did all that we could
Don't blame these lips these hungry lips were pleading for you
They used all the tender words that they should
And if you break and fall apart I couldn't blame you heart we did all that we could
These misty eyes these tear filled eyes were picture taken
Grading all the memories that they could
They're the only thing you'll have when you're through breakin'
Heart we did all that we could heart we did all that we couldWe both work hard for money already spent
Blaming each other for where it all went
Never thinking of love only paying the loans
Griping bout' bills and keeping up with the Jones
Just once let's forget about making ends meet
Or whose got the nicest yard on the street
Darlin' let loose, let your hair down
We're staying at home for a night on the town
[Chorus]
So turn the music up, and dim the lights down
Let those old records keep spinning around
Replace all our worries with some romance
Tell me you love me then we'll shut up and dance
When you're in my arms it makes me feel
Like I own a mansion on top of the hil
But it's not how big's the house it's how happy's the home
How poor is a rich man who lives all alone
[Chorus: x2]The magic of love, nobody knows how the trick is done
It's the sleight of hand, the woman and man, the power of one plus one
It takes two, it takes two
Any less than that won't do
To make love it takes two
I spent some time on my own and it sure was rough
It made me strong but all along I was dreaming of a lovers touch
'Cause it takes two, it takes two
Any less than that won't do
To make love it takes two
It takes two
Girl you know it's true
To make love it takes two
Since I met you everything adds up
If we were divided now well I wouldn't amount to much
In the Garden of Eden it was Adam and Eve, throwing caution to the wind
It's just like you, just like me, so baby it ain't no sin
It takes two, it takes two
'Cause any less than that won't do
To make love it takes two
It takes two
Girl I want you
To make love it takes twoLike the ancient Roman empire this world is doin' to fall
And it's much too bigger thing for mortal men
Just take a look around and see the writing on the wall
Somehow we've got to find a helping hand
This world has never been in the awful shape it's in
And people scorn the things our leaders do
It's time the prayer was spoken from the heart of every man
Jesus take a hold and lead us through
The mighty roar of gunfire is now a local sound
And our city streets are filled with angry men
Love is now a mockery throughout our troubled land
And destruction seems to be the current trend
This world has never been in the awful shape it's in
Our leaders seem in doubt of what to do
It's time the prayer was spoken from the heart of every man
Oh Jesus take a hold and lead us through Jesus take a hold and lead us throughHey sister moon you shine and shine
You say you need my lovin' but you want to be free
And you've made up your mind
Ah sister moon I am your sun
You have your independence
Except for the one that you depend on
You say you're tired you'll be living without me
You know what it is to be alone
You'll find yourself another companion
You'll never need to be back home
Ah sister moon I am your sun
You have your independence
Except for the one that you depend on
You say you're tired you'll be living without me
You know what it is to be alone
You'll find yourself another companion
You'll never need to be back home
Sister moon sister moonI got a hundred dollars smokin' in my billfold
I know I ought to save it, but it's burnin' a hole
Right through my pocket and into my skin
Come Monday morning I'll be broke again
It's finally Friday
I'm free again
I got my motor running for a wild weekend
It's finally Friday
I'm out of control
Forget the workin' blues
And let the good times roll
I got a little sugar baby down the road
She's sittin' on a radio and rockin' on roll
We'll dance up a storm, and later, all night
We'll be workin' on doin' all the wrong things right
It's finally Friday
I'm free again
I got my motor running for a wild weekend
It's finally Friday
I'm out of control
Forget the workin' blues
And let the good times roll
Monday, I'll be hurtin' with my head in a vice
Tuesday, I'll be wonderin' if I'll ever survive
Wednesday and Thursday, I'll be slowly tunin' in
Friday, I'll be revin' up my motor again
It's finally Friday
I'm free again
I got my motor running for a wild weekend
It's finally Friday
I'm out of control
Forget the workin' blues
And let the good times roll
It's finally Friday
I got my motor running for a wild weekend
It's finally Friday
Forget the workin' blues
And let the good times rollBecause the light always finds the darkest corner
And the raindrop always will rise to the clouds on high
And the red leaf falls back down to the garden
And the birds in the field know when to circle and fly
The cold it comes down from the mountain
And the river moves on to the ocean blue
Because all these things are true
I'll always be turning to you
Always
The touch of your skin on mine in the morning
And the rhythm of your breath in the moment of grace
It's like cotton, like linen, like velvet, like water, like stars in the
Sky, they'll always be falling
Like a breeze through the door, we lie on the floor, and I look in your face
In your eyes I see my reflection
And there's nothing more I can say or do
I cannot deny it's true
I'll always be turning to you
Always
Everything crumbles and nothing is real
But there's one drop of water in this raging river
Always turning to you
Turning to you
So I look for you in the fiery sunset
I look for you in the new sunrise
I listen for your name in the silence
I meet you behind closed eyes
In everything I do
I'll always be turning to you
Always returning
Always turning to you
Always and always and turning to you
I will always be turning to youShe wakes while you sleep and tiptoes out softly and brings you your coffee in bed
And she crawls in beside you with biscuits and kisses until all your hungers're fed
Then she opens the paper and reads how them rodeo rowdies have rolled into town
Then she's gone with the wind and you shook off again
And here's how it looks from the ground
With a rodeo queen belle of the ball she's out of the shoe and she's tossin' 'em all
And if you think about it you will take the fall lovin' a rodeo queen
[ guitar ]
She's home in the morning looks a bit weary and smilin' a little bit strange
But she fixes your coffee and lays down beside you just as if nothin' had changed
And while she holds you you're holdin' back words you know that you'd better not say
But she makes no excuses shows no regrets and you just better love her that way
She's a rodeo queen belle of the ball...
She's a rodeo queen belle of the ball...(Dolly Parton)
She stands before the mirror
Smiles at her reflection
Striking sexy poses in the glass
She paints her lips a brilliant red
Piles her hair high on her head
Struggles to replace a false eyelash
She powders up her face
Paints her cheeks to match her lips
She wears a dress cut low in the front
Fittin' tight around her hips
And there inside her room
She stands and gazes at herself
Where beauty lives in memory
She lives in fairy tales
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all
She sings as she goes waltzing' cross the floor
She keeps a candle burning
And she waits for his returning
When beauty lives in memory
It lives forevermore
She was a fairy princess once
And was by all adored
They say she was the fairest of them all
They called her Cinderella
And they say that every fella
Would gladly answer to her beck and call
So the story went
They tell of how this handsome prince
Stole her heart and wandered far away
He took her heart and took her mind
Now she has lost all track of time
Forty years has passed and still she waits singing
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all
She sings as she goes waltzing' cross the floor
She keeps a candle burning
And she waits for his returning
When beauty lives in memory
It lives forevermore
Meanwhile back inside her room
The shads are pulled it's half past noon
But in her mind why it's forty years ago
She recalls the beauty of their love
She remembers he was beautiful
And of course she always knew she was
And so the past unfolds
And all at once inside her mind
She sees him at the door
And as he's leading her away
She feels the room begin to sway
Where beauty lives in memory
She falls dead upon the floor
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all
She sings as she goes waltzing' cross the floor
She keeps a candle burning
And she waits for his returning
When beauty lives in memory
It lives forevermoreLove is no excuse for what we're doing
For we both know that's two hearts could break
We tell ourselves we've got to have each other but love is no excuse for us to make
Sure we love each other and it could be so right
But not if someone else have got to pay
Our love for each other looks good in the night
But our love can never see the light of day
It's been going on for much too long now and our wrongs have mounted one by one
We tell ourselves it's cause we love each other
But love is no excuse for what we've done
Sure we love each otherOnce I made a promise that I'd never do no wrong
But I feel the yearn to love you even though I know it's wrong
You'll have to take my hand and lead me slowly through the door
I'll be wrong in what I'm doin' but I can't refuse anymore
Lead me on and take control of how I feel
I can't do this on my own it's against my will
I need love warm and tender in a way I've never known
If you want me I'll go with you but you'll have to lead me on
Lead me on and take control
If you want me I'll go with you but you'll have to lead me onTrying not to love you,falling in every way
With you around I keep losing around day by day
Trying to be fair both to me and to you
Trying not to love you is hard to do
I guess there's no use hiding
What everybody knows
'Cause to other eyes there's no disguise
For the love that shows
If I'm not being clear I'll explain these words to you
Trying not to love you is hard to do
I guess there's no use hiding
What everybody knows
'Cause to other eyes there's no disguise
For the love that shows
If I'm not being clear I'll explain these words to you
Trying not to love you is hard to doHe had a stroke in'95
They thought it best that he reside in a nursing home
His family vowed they'd never leave him
Last time they came to see him was three years ago
He spent his whole life providin'
Now he was down to relyin' on medicare
The nurses took a likin' to him
They'd get his wheelchair out and push him on sunny days
He couldn't walk, he couldn't speak
Seemed so far outta reach
But in his mind, as far as they knew, he could be
Fly fishin'
Workin' on that Firebird engine
Runnin' 99 proof moonshine cross the county line
3,2,1 And ignition off on some space shuttle mission
Playin' QB for the Cowboys
Getting high on the crowd noise and the bright lights
'Cause deep inside things were rockin' in the mind
Of John J Blanchard
One afternoon in June
A nurse saw his finger move she bout had a heart attack
She went screamin' down the hall
"Hey it's a miracle ya'll, I think he's comin' back"
The doctors all rushed in, said
"Do you know what year this is?"
"How many fingers am I holdin', and where've you been?"
And he said
Fly fishin'
Workin' on that Firebird engine
Running 99 proof moonshine cross that county line
3,2,1 And ignition off on some space shuttle mission
An playin' QB for the Cowboys
Getting high on the crown noise and the bright lights
Yeah, this time things were rockin' in the mind
Of John J Blanchard
He had a stroke in '95
They thought it best he reside in a nursing homeThere is no love and there is no hate
There is no feeling at all
I look at you and you look at me
But we might as well stare at the wall
Cause you don't see me and I don't see you
Just a shadow of love that is gone
There is no love and there is no hate
No reason to hurry home
There's no tiny hands to reach out to us
No plans bein' made anymore
We have no tomorrow our future is gone
There's only sadness in store
We don't care enough to even ask questions
And when we're together we still feel alone
There is no love and there is no hate
No reason to hurry home
There is nothing to look forward to
No reason to hurry homeA mason jar full of shine
A CD of Leann Rhimes
Is what I bought for our anniversary tonight
Now here I stand with my petunias in hand
And you've got a headache again
I hit a yard sale cut my toenails
Trimmed my nose hairs just right
I thought you'd be impressed
By my new hunting vest
But there's no chance tonight
It ain't the first time this year
It'll be the TV and beer
I about forgot what's its like to be here
As I sleep on the floor
While she sniffles and snores
Did I shave my back for this
Oh man Aww woo
This things duller than a dag burn butter knife
Now I'll bet she'll regret
That she didn't let
Me take her to that motel with a pool
You know its so hard to find
Free HBO and Showtime
And them vibrating beds sure are cool
I souped up my RV
Fired up my Flobee
Trimmed my toupee just right
I tried self tanning cream it turned my skin green
Uh you know the directions uh said that it might
Well its a mystery to me
Why she don't like Cledus T.
Most find me hard to resist
I'm wearing my brand new drawers
And wondering what the heck for
Did I shave my back for this
Dee-Anna
Did I shave my back for this
Ohh ohh ohh
(Coughs)Don't the moon look pretty
Shining down through the trees
Don't that shining moon look pretty, baby
Shining down through the trees
You know I can see my baby
When he can't see me
Yeah, I tiptoe to his window
Just to see my baby snore
I tiptoe to his window
Just to see how sweetie snores
You know it makes me feel like jumping, lord, lord
Through the keyhole in his door
Come crawl up to your window
Let me whisper in your ear
Come on and crawl up to your window, darling
Let me whisper in your ear
You know, I got something to tell you, baby
I don't want that girl around here
... keep her awayJohn Henry was a little colored boy
You could hold him on the palm of your hand
And his papa cried out this lonesome farewell
Son gonna be a steel drivin' man, Lord, Lord
Gonna be a steel drivin' man
John Henry went upon the mountain
Looked down on the other side
Lord, the mountain was so tall
John Henry was so small
He laid down his hammer and he cried, Lord, Lord
He laid down his hammer and he cried
John Henry told his captain
(What it is?)
I want to go to bed
Now fix me a pallet of straw to lay down
Got money roarin' in my head, Lord, Lord
Got money roarin' in my headOne night while out for a ramble
The hour was just about nine
I met a young maiden in Frisco
On the corner of Geary and Pine
On her face, there was beauty of nature
And her eyes just seemed to expand
With hair so rich and so brilliant
Entwined in a blue velvet band
We strolled down the street together
In my pocket, she placed her small hand
She planted the evidence on me
The girl in the blue velvet band
Well, I heard the scream of the siren
And the girl in the blue velvet band
She left me to face all the trouble
What a diamond that was worth ten grand
Well, at night when bed-time was ringin'
Standing close to the bar
I fancied I heard a voice calling
Far out on the ocean of stars
They sent me to San Quentin for stealing
God knows I'm an innocent man
But the guilty one, now she lies dying
The girl in the blue velvet band
Well, I'll be out in a year and I'm leaving
And I'll carry the name of a man
That served ten years in prison
For the girl in the blue velvet bandEverything is a weather pattern
Everything is a weather pattern
and it flows down to you
and it flows right through you
what were you thinking?
what were you thinking?
didn't somebody tell you?
that life was all loss.
All your friends and your family, your gonna lose
eventually. All your friends and your family, your gonna lose eventually.
What were you thinking?
What were you thinking?
Didn't somebody tell you? that life was not all loss.
That life was not all loss.
That life was not all loss...Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
You see that girl with the red dress on,
Some folks call her Dinah
Stole my heart away from me
Way down in Louisiana
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
The big bee sucks the blossom
And the little bee makes the honey
Poor man throws the cotton
And the rich man makes the money
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
We travel all over this country wide
Playing music by the hour
Always wear this great big smile
We never do look sour
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Would I go
You
Let me off
And I'll walk down to Greenwood
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marryCancel tomorrow, I need no more time
I've wasted our words, running you through my mind
You'll love me forever not counting today
So cancel tomorrow or it will just be in my way
You promised me true love that never would die
You promised no heartaches, no hurt or goodbyes
But now it's all over, what else can I say?
But cancel tomorrow or it will be just like today
Cancel tomorrowDown from the attic in your old things
My new girlfriend has a curious streak
Half lit, in the hall
She's like you
Twenty years ago
Clothes from a case you'd thrown at me
Orange, yellow, red and chartreuse green
Way back in the day
I lost you
Don't tell me here we go again
Seventies girl
Don't come any closer
There's gonna be trouble tonight
You're not staying over
Hey there seventies girl
Never should have told her
You want to be older
Than you were
She was transcendental then
Her beautiful eyes through your rose specs
Way back, in the day
I loved you
Or something like it anyway
Seventies girl
You've been taken over
You never had a cradle to rock
Now you want to go there
Hey there seventies girl
Never should have told her
You want to be older
Than you were
We fell apart
Just like that dress
Then taught ourselves unhappiness
I don't recall much, I confess
But wonder where she's gone
Seventies girl
Don't come any closer
There's gonna be trouble tonight
You're not staying over
Hey there, seventies girl
Never should've showed her
You want to be older
Than you wereSome days are diamonds, Some days are stone
Some days the hard times won't leave us alone
Sometimes the cold wind brought chill to my bones
Some days are diamonds, Some days are stone.
How the face that I see in the mirror
More and more is a stranger to me
More and more I can see there's a danger
In becoming what I never thought I'll be.
Some days are diamonds, Some days are stone
Some days the hard times won't leave us alone
Sometimes the cold wind brought chill to my bones
Some days are diamonds, Some days are stone.
So when you ask how I've been here without you
I like to say I've been fine and so I did
But we both know the truth is hard to come by
And if I told the truth, that's not quit true.
Some days are diamonds, Some days are stone
Some days the hard times won't leave us alone
Sometimes the cold wind brought chill to my bones
Some days are diamonds, Some days are stone.
Some days are diamonds, Some days are stone
Some days the hard times won't leave me alone
Sometimes the cold wind brought chill to my bones
Some days are diamonds, Some days are stone.
Some days are diamonds, Some days are stoneAs I read the letters that you wrote to me
It's you that I am dreaming of
And as I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love
I miss you, darling, more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars above
And with every heartbeat, I still dream of you
And remember our faded love
As I think of the past and all the pleasure we had
As I watched the mating of the dove
It was in the springtime when we said goodbye
I remember our faded love
I miss you, darling, more and more everyday
As heaven would miss the stars above
And with every heartbeat, I still dream of you
And remember our faded love
And remember our faded loveIf a girl could be made of clay then I could mould that girl my way
I got her picture in my mind but there's no need to waste my time
Cause I got you and God knew what to do when he made you
Come the day that you were born an angel took an earthly form
Cause if you take one little girl add all the wonders of the world
Then I'd have you and God knew what to do when he made you
God created the seven wonders in his usual style
Wrapped them up in the piece of sunshine put them in your smile
So if the sun don't ever shine I don't worry cause I got mine
When I got you and God knew what to do when he made you
God created the seven wonders...Funny thing about growing older is I start looking back
Over my shoulder and I start thinking that
Someone else I could have been if I'd done it differently
There I go lost again in some kind of fantasy
Without your love I couldn't keep it real
Without your love I'd be a spinning wheel
Funny thing about dreams is that when they don't come true
When the real world don't do just like I want it to
And the voices in my head start talking and they just won't quit
It's like I'm trying to put the pieces of a puzzle back together and they just won't fit
Now if there ever was a time
When I needed to find a little peace of mind
And I don't know how
It's now(Dolly Parton)
In my mind I've made love to you often
But only in my mind can it be so
'Cause there's someone at home that's countin' on me
And if I did, I'm sure that he would know
Yes, he would know, yes, he could tell
For, he has loved me long enough to know me very well
And if I lied, he'd see it in my eyes
I know my guilt would show and he would know
But I must admit you're someone very special
And it would be so easy to let go
Makin' love to you could be so easy
But if I did, I'm sure that he would know
Yes, he would know, yes, he could tell
For, he has loved me long enough to know me very well
And if I lied, he'd see it in my eyes
I know my guilt would show and he would know
My conscience just won't let me make love to you
I know it would be sweet, but I just can't
When I go home to him I must be able
To look him in the eyes and say I ain't
'Cause he would know, yes, he could tell
For, he has loved me long enough to know me very well
And if I lied, he'd see it in my eyes
I know my guilt would show and he would know
He would knowI cried for you now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning that's one thing you're learning
I cried for you what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found the heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you now it's your turn to cry over me
Now I found two eyesI see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day the dark sacred night
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
They're really sayin' I love you
I hear babies cry I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
Yes I think to myself what a wonderful worldEverytime the tide comes in the tide goes out
Some folks fail some do alright
You could take a john boat all the way to town
Had an angry broken father, in a house beside the water
[CHORUS:]
Shadowland, what secret are you keeping
Are you only sleepin to wake another day
Shadowland, Oh how could I have loved you
I never really knew you, anyway
Funny how the stars down there shine so bright
Breeze comes in just like a prayer
Mama asked Jesus to keep Daddy home at night
I guess it was a pity, but Jesus never did it
[CHORUS:]
Shadowland, what secret are you keeping
Are you only sleepin to wake another day
Shadowland, Oh how could I have loved you
I never really knew you, anyway
[BRIDGE:]
Storms blew up from Mexico, the boats would all come in
Nights like that you could smell salt water on the wind
I was so young back then
Brother was a gifted child so they said
We could build a starship in the yard
Angry voices came from the house at night
So we'd play a game he made up
And stay out a little later
[CHORUS:]
Shadowland, what secret are you keeping
Are you only sleepin to wake another day
Shadowland, Oh how could I have loved you
I never really knew you, anywayLook around little darlin' do you know who I am
I'm as much your reflection as I am my own man
You need not to defend love life's the house where we live
We cannot see tomorrow only feel what we give
Put your head on my shoulders dry the tears from your eyes
Watch the sun's fadin' ember hear the wind as she cries
We talk and hear about loneliness
The cold blue hunger of the soul
But if this world has redemptiveness
Why ever should we be somewhere
Where there's nowhere to go
Put your head on my shoulders dry the tears from your eyes
Watch the sun's fadin' ember hear the wind as she cries
Hear the wind as she criesSometimes I don't know where
This dirty road is taking me
Sometimes I can't even see the reason why
I guess I keep a-gamblin'
Lots of booze and lots of ramblin'
It's easier than just waitin' around to die
One time, friends, I had a ma
I even had a pa
He beat her with a belt once 'cause she cried
She told him to take care of me
Headed down to Tennessee
It's easier than just waitin' around to die
I came of age and I found a girl
In a Tuscaloosa bar
She cleaned me out and hit in on the sly
I tried to kill the pain, bought some wine
And hopped a train
Seemed easier than just waitin' around to die
A friend said he knew
Where some easy money was
We robbed a man, and brother did we fly
The posse caught up with me
And drug me back to Muskogee
It's two long years I've been waitin' around to dieWaves are rollin' in, lazy summer wind
Sittin' in the sand, holdin' to your hand
I was ten and you were nine
Way out on the gulf shore line
You became my girl, I became your man
Underneath the stars, we were makin' plans
You said I do and you've done just fine
Way out on the gulf shore line
The sea will moan, waves will roll
The sea gulls fly, on the winds that blow
And I'll love you till the sun don't shine
Way out on the gulf shore line
Graduation day, Johnny walked away
Hard to say goodbye, harder not to cry
He had to leave his folks behind
Way out on the gulf shore lineThey say men and women are worlds apart
With neither one willing to travel that far
But I've never bought into psychological stuff
And never claimed to be a bonafied genius
But if men are from Mars and women are from Venus
I'm goin' to Venus
Well, strap me in, ship me out, beam me up Scotty
Take me to the land of those heavenly bodies
Stay here if you want to but just between us
If men are from Mars and women are from Venus
I'm goin' to Venus
Women want a man who ain't afraid to commit
And take 'em out to dinner that's candle lit
So I'm givin' in to the battle of the sexes
And callin' up ahead to make reservations
'Cause if men are from Mars and women are from Venus
I'm goin' to Venus
If you come by the house and I'm not in
You can call me long, long, long distance
Got better things to do than sit around and talk
'Cause I'm blastin' off of this big red rockNothing gonna break heart your today
Nothing gonna steal your light away, no
Even when the skies are turning gray
Ah, you're gonna welcome in the rain, yeah
Come on, come on
Ah, let me hear it another time
Come on, come on
I?ll raise the spirit
Nothing gonna chain you once your free
Haven't gotta live in misery, no
Even when you tried out every key
But still another door worth opening, yeah
Come on, come on
Ah, let me hear it another time
Come on, come on
I?ll raise the spirit
Music in your heart, coming on in waves, love
But thunder in your head is rolling away
Nothing gonna twist your arm again
Nothing gonna sway you like the wind, no
Nothing gonna get under your skin
Nothing gonna twist your arm again, no
Come on, come on
Ah, let me hear it another time
Come on, come on
I?ll raise the spirit
Come on, come on
Ah, let me hear it another time
Come on, come on
I?ll raise the spiritWhen the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I would offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
There's no doubt in my mind where you belong
I'd go hungry, I'd go blind for you
I'd go crawling down the avenue
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love
Storms are raging on a rolling sea
Down the highway of regret
Winds of change are blowing wild and free, yeah huh
But you ain't seen nothing like me yet
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
Make you happy, make your dreams come true
To make you feel my loveI tried to love you holding you everything I know to do
Baby I tried I can't love you like I used to
I tried kissing you missing you anything but hurting you
Oh baby I tried just can't love you the way I used to
You know I've been your woman I've given you all of me
I explain how my feelings have changed all I can say is I'm sorry
Yes I believe in you believe in you can find somebody to
To love you and really love you baby I triedFiery kisses linger on two lips that miss you so
As my nervous fingers sort the pages through
Here and there I find the line that makes me want to live
Yesterday's letters take me back to you
Yesterday's letters with yesterday's glow
Will tell me you love me anytime I wanna know
Yesterday's letters so timeless and true
Will always keep me close close to you
[ ac.guitar ]
A world that's held together by some lines of faded blue
Is not exactly what I had in mind
But Cupid's little arrow can't be shared by more than two
Yesterday's letters will be my share of you
Yesterday's letters with yesterday's glow...
Will always keep me close close to youBaby now I understand
How time can alter any plan then gently lead you to know
Truth hopes lies will never show
Oh that love only pauses for a while and is always free to go
Honey I learned not to seek
Any promise hearts must keep after mine had come to know
And disappointedly so
That love only pauses for a while and is always free to go
At every fading glance I reach to take it in my hands
As if that touch might be the one last chance
And though all those distant dreams
Seldom turn out what they seem in the rush to let them grow
Their loss had taught me to know
That love only pauses for a while and is always free to go
At every fading glance I reach to take it in my hands
As if that touch might be the one last chance
Baby now I understand
How time can alter any plan then gently lead you to know
Truth hopes lies will never show
That love only pauses for a while and is always free to go
Yeah love only pauses for a while and is always free to goI was fifteen, she was eighteen
The prettiest thing I'd ever seen in my life
I loved her at first sight
I found her in Marietta, a town north of Atlanta
I brought her home to see my folks
They loved her too
We were together for a long time
Thought it would be for all time
But things change and rearrange
She had to go
She left me cryin' in '79
An airline pilot, in Carolina
I was a wreck, can't drive a check
It broke my heart
My first love was an older woman
There's been many since
But there'll never be another
Built in 1955, snowshoe white, overdrive
I never should've sold her, I'll always love her
She was mine
Years went by, teardrops dried
I got her back, I was surprised
In '93, a gift to me on Christmas Eve
We were both older, so I restored her
Could've sold her, for a lot more
But I will never she's mine forever
Until I go
My first love was an older woman
There's been many since
But there'll never be another
Built in 1955, snowshoe white, overdrive
I never should've sold her, I'll always love her
She was mine
I'll never sell her she's mine forever
I love her soI was headed north on Highway Five
On a star-lit Sunday night
When a pick-up truck flew by me out of control
As I watched in my headlights
He swerved left then back right
He never hit the brakes
As he left the road
I found him lying in the grass
Among the steel and glass
With an empty whiskey bottle by his side
And through the blood and tears
He whispered in my ear
A few last words just before he died
Don't tell Mama I was drinkin'
Lord knows her soul would never rest
I can't leave this world with Mama thinkin'
I met the Lord with whiskey on my breath
I still think about that night
And how that young man died
And how others sometimes pay for our mistakes
The last thing on his mind
As he left this world behind
Was knowing someone else's heart would break
Don't tell Mama I was drinkin'
Lord knows her soul would never rest
I can't leave this world with Mama thinkin'
I met the Lord with whiskey on my breath
Don't tell Mama I was drinkin'Before you make up your mind to leave me
Before you make up your mind to walk out the door
Before you telle me that it's all over
Let me say what I have to say it won't take me all day
And if you still wanna leave don't stay for I won't try to hold you anymore
Does she really love you way that I love you
Does she treat you right even when you've done wrong
If she's woman enough to forgive you way that I'm willing to
If she ain't then don't go for I still love you so we all make mistakes I know
Give these thoughts a little time before you make up your mind
[ guitar ]
Does she really love you way that I love you
Will she treat you right even when you do wrong
If she's woman enough to forgive you way that I'm willing to
If she ain't then don't go for I still love you so we all make mistakes I know
Give these thoughts a little time before you make up your mind
Give these thoughts a little time before you make up your mindHarvest moon
Orange sky
Empty field out of sight
Back-end of a dead-end road
Long necks by the case
Stacked up on Diamond plates
JBL's sitting high on poles
Run a match down the side
Gasoline, stack of pine
Get ready here we go
Tonight we gonna burn it
We gonna turn it up
Bright like a K.C. light
We gonna kill it
We gonna feel it
Till the stars fade out of sight
Full throttle, tipping back bottles
Gonna set this field on fire
Tonight, ooo ooo ooo
Tonight
See the smoke
Rising up
Pour some fire in a cup
Pinch of long cut pass it around
Feel the flame
Feel the heat
Feel her skin next to me
Yeah I'm 'bout to get unwound
Tonight we gonna burn it
We gonna turn it up
Bright like a K.C. light
We gonna kill it
We gonna feel it
Till the stars fade out of sight
Full throttle, tipping back bottles
Gonna set this field on fire

Ain't nothing I'd rather see
Whoa-oh whoa-oh
There's no place that I'd rather be

Tonight
Oh yeah we really gonna rock it
Tonight
Are we really gonna stop it?

Tonight we're throwin' it down
Yeah we're tearing it up
Burning it to the ground
Won't you stand up
Put your hands up
Put your cans up
Mmm let me hear you say
Whoa-oh whoa-oh
Whoa-oh whoa-oh
Whoa-oh whoa-ohWaiting for the lozenge to clear yer throat
So you can stand up and say all the words you wrote
All along the fences, all along the lines
Yer gumption's fading and the honeysuckle's dyin'
Honeysuckle's dyin' and the birds all cry 2X
Rain around the houses, rain around the limbs
Everything yer hating is everything you been
So pass around the roses, shiny up the bell
How dry I once was there ain't no tongue can tell
Ain't no tongue can tell and the rain it fell 2X
Twist another ashbone, make it phat and loose
Apply the isopropyl and play that ol' gray goose
All along the fences, all along the lines
Yer gumption's fading and the honeysuckle's dyin'
Honeysuckle's dyin' and the birds all cry 2XDon't encourage me
I'll do anything
I want to be loving
Who I want to be loving
I can't wait to see
Circumstances changing over
For the chosen few
I want to be loving
Who I want to be loving
I'll say anything
It's almost impossible
To a stranger
I want to be loving
Who I want to be loving
Who I want to be loving
Who I want to be lovingHey good looking.
Hey good looking what you got cooking
How's about cooking something up for me
Hey sweet baby don't you think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe
I got a brand new car and a ten dollar bill
And I know a spot right over the hill
The juke box's jumping the dance is free
So if you want to have fun come along with me
Hey good looking what you got cooking
How's about cooking something up for me
I'm free and ready so we can go steady
How's about saving all your time for me
No more looking, I know I've been cooking
How's about keeping steady company
I'm gonna pull my date book over the fence
And find me one for five or ten cents
I'll keep it 'til it's covered with age
''cause I'm writing your name down in every page.
ChorusTo me, you are the hand that I reach for
When I've lost my way
To me, you are the first star of evening
The sun that warms my day
Just as sure as I'm sure
There's a heaven, this was meant to be
No road is too long
As long as you belong to me
To me, you are the truth I believe in
I believe in you
To me, you are the love I have looked for
My whole life through
Just as sure as I'm sure
There's a heaven, this was meant to be
No road is too long
As long as you belong to meHe stood out in the Cheyenne area dust by the latch on chute number four
The young cowboys were laughin' at him and at the out of date clothes that he wore
Though his trophy buckle was old it told of the glory he surely had seen
And the beard that showed neath his old John B was wirey silver sheen
With a plug in his lip from his back pocket rip and his faded old denim jeans blue
Where a halo show white like a moon in the night
Was a hole where his snoozed worn through
He spat in the dust and he bitterly cussed as the bull tried to tear down the chute
Then he looked up at me with a gleam in his eye
And he placed his old hand on my boot
He said you'll ride this old bull on your worst ever day
With your hind leg chained to a tree
As I am made ready to concur the brute here's an old song my old man sang to me
Go ridin' young cowboy go winnin' and goin' out boy
Don't let him put you on the ground
Go spur him young cowboy de fur him riding out boy
Show 'em that your Oklahoma bound
Well I marked eighty points and I won me the round
The fans in the stands went plum wild
Well I could see my old daddy just a dancin' a jig
Well I looked up to the Lord and I smiled
I said thanks for my good arm and thanks for my luck
And thanks that I'm still fit and young
But thanks most of all for them old bulls that buck
For my dad and the song that he sung
Go ridin' young cowboy...
Well I've been down the road many miles since that day
Things ain't changed much since I've begun
I still think of my dad when I'm ropin' one up and I sing his song to my son
Go ridin' young cowboy...
Go ridin' young cowboy...Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord,
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGeeI always called her old faithful she was always there when I came home
And I never thought the day would come she'd leave me
But for me those kind of thinking days are gone
Cause old faithful ain't faithful anymore she's stepping out to even up the score
She's out there where the lights are bright wineing dining every night
And old faithful ain't faithful anymore
[ steel ]
Night after night she sat waiting just to touch the fool that she loves so
And now for her those waiting days for her are over
For absence makes the warmest heart grow cold
And old faithful ain't faithful...
And old faithful ain't faithful anymoreWhat's that?
I hear angels singing.
Telling me to make my move.
Listen to it, their voices ringing, baby.
If you feel it, get in the groove.
Love is a rhythm of two hearts beating,
pounding out a message steady and true.
Talk to me baby, tell me what you're feeling.
I know what love is, what's it to you?
Time's up, train's a-leavin', baby,
Are you ready to take that ride?
Get on board, don't keep me waiting,
Say you're willing to cross that line.
Love is a rhythm of two hearts beating,
pounding out a message steady and true.
Talk to me baby, tell me what you're feeling.
I know what love is, what's it to you?You find the thrill each time you let me down you know if you need me I'll be around
And when all your love affairs come to an end you know you can fool me again
Fool me again make my heart believe that your sweet sweet love belongs to me
Yes play the part and let my heart pretend come back and fool me again
The same old line that keeps me hanging on is all I think about when I'm alone
And though I know how our love affair will end come back and fool me again
Fool me againYOU GET TO ME
WRITER DON WILLIAMS
You get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me,
You just can't believe how you get to me.
Night after night I've tried holding you tight and then I'll stay away.
I've tried holding your hand, being your man and just anyway.
When it comes down to feelings it's always the same old song ,
My poor hearts just reeling but you act like something's wrong.
Oh you get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me,
You just can't believe how you get to me.
If I could cry, bring a tear to your eye, maybe that's the way.
'Cause were in the strains of living your pains from yesterday.
Really got to keep on growing, looking for the brighter day.
Like the water that keeps on flowing well I just can't stay away.
You get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me,
You just can't believe how you get to me.
Oh you get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me,
You just can't believe how you get to me.Precious Lord Take My hand lead me on let me stand
Lord I'm tired weak and I'm worn
Through the storm through the night
Lead me on to the light
Precious Lord take my hand, lead me on
When my friends don't understand
And they fail to lend a hand
When my load gets to heavy to bear
As I go along life's way
I just slip away and pray
And dear Lord I can always find you there.
When my way groweth drear
And the night's drawin' near
When my life is almost gone
At that river I stand
Guide my feet Lord, won't you take my hand
Precious Lord take my hand, lead me on.
Precious Lord Take My hand lead me on let me stand
Lord I'm tired getting weak and so worn
Through the storm through the night
Lead me on Lord to that blessed light
Precious Lord take my hand, lead me on.(Hank Card/Conrad Deisler)
I was one tough nut until the day you made me crack
I was one tough customer until you paid me back
I was one tough cookie 'til I crumbled in your hand
Since that day I'm half a man
I drive my old nine-wheeler down I-two-and-a-half
The other truckers pity me so they try not to laugh
I pull off in Yreka and check into Motel Three
They've always got a little room for me
Chorus:
Half a man; I'm half a man
Sometimes I try to do the best I can
I know that on my own foot someday I'll have to stand
But right now I don't know how
Because I'm only half a man
I play solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of twenty-six
You might think I'm crazy but that's how I get my kicks
I listen to Rush Limbaugh 'cause he helps to ease my pain
He makes lots of sense if you're a man with half a brain
I buy a tenth of whiskey and a cold three-pack of beer
I drink 'til I see single when I gaze into my mirror
I know that through that looking glass is where I'll have to be
Reunited with the better half of me
Chorus
Someday I'll find a woman and a half and take her hand
But 'til then I don't know when
I will be more than half a manMade famous by Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys
Recorded by many artists, Elvis, Patsy Cline, Ray Price, Johnny
Rodrigues, Willie Nelson and a host of others.
As I look at the letters that you wrote to me
It's you that I am thinking of
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love
I miss you darling more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded love
As I think of the past and all the pleasures we had
As I watch the mating of the dove
It was in the springtime when you said goodbye
I remember our faded loveIf I have wounded any soul today
If I have caused one foot to go astray
If I have walked in my own willful way
Dear Lord, forgive
If I have uttered idol words or fame
If I have turned aside from want or pain
Yes, I offend some other through the strain
Dear Lord, forgive
Forgive the sins I have confessed to Thee
Forgive the secret sins I do not see
Oh, guide me, love me and my keeper be
Dear Lord, forgiveUp above me are the skies like the twinkle in your eyes
These things are the color of the blues
In the mail your letter came, the ink and paper looked the same
Blue must be the color of the blues
Bluebird sitting in the tree seems to sympathize with me
For he's not singing like he used to do
The pretty waters in the sea feel as cold as you left me
Yes, blue must be the color of the blues
There's a rainbow overhead with more blue than gold and red
Blue must be the color angels choose
A blue dress you proudly wore when you left to return no more
Blue must be the color of the blues
Blue days come and blue days go, how I feel nobody knows
Life is mighty empty without you
There's a blue note in each song that I sing since you are gone
Yes, blue must be the color of the bluesJohn Roy was a boy I knew
Since he was 3 and I was two
Grew up two little houses down from me
The only bad apples on our family tree
Kinda ripened and rottened in our puberty
Two kindred spirits bound by destiny
Well now I was smart but I lacked ambition
Johnny was wild with no inhibition
Was about like mixin' fire and gasoline
And he'd say
Hey Romeo, let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls a couple real hillbillies
Got a pocket full of cash and that old Ford truck
Fuzzy cat hangin' from the mirror for luck
Said don't you know all those little brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world
Long around our tenth year
We found two airplane tickets to the hell outta here
Got scholarships to some small town school in Texas
We learned to drink Sangrias 'til the dawn's early light
Eat eggs Ranchero's and throw up all night
And tell those daddy's girls we were majorin' in the rodeo
Aw but my favorite memory of school that fall
Was the night John Roy came runnin' down in the hall
Wearin' nothing but cowboy boots and a big sombrero
And he was yellin'
Hey Romeo, let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls a couple real hillbillies
Got a pocket full of cash and that old Ford truck
Fuzzy cat hangin' from the mirror for luck
Said don't you know all those little brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world
And I say we had a little change in plans
Like when Paul McCartney got busted in Japan
And I said we got waylaid when we set foot on Mexican soil
You see the borderman guard with a fu manchu mustach
Kinda stumbled on John's pocketful of American cash
He said "doin' a little funny business in Mexico Amigo"
But all I could think about was savin' my own tail
When he metioned 10 years in a Mexican jail
So I pointed at John Roy and said
It's all his, now please let me go, I mean it was your idea genius
I was just layin' there in bed, when you said
Hey Romeo, let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls a couple real hillbillies
Got a pocket full of cash and that old Ford truck
Fuzzy cat hangin' from the mirror for luck
Said don't you know all those little brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world
Ah we're still best friends
Temporary cell mates
WhooYou were mine for just awhile,
Now you're putting on the style,
And you never once looked back,
To your home across the track,
You're the gossip of the town,
But my heart can still be found,
Where you tossed it on the ground,
Pick me up on your way down,
[Chorus:]
Pick me up on your way down,
When you're blue and all alone,
When their glamour starts to bore you,
Come on back where you belong,
When you learn these things are true,
I'll be waiting here for you,
When you tumble to the ground
Pick me up on your way down,
--- Instrumental ---
They have changed your attitude,
Made you hoggie, and so rude,
Your new friends can take the blame,
Underneath you're still the same,
You may be their pride and joy,
But they'll find another toy,
When your true love can't be found
Pick me up on your way down,
[Chorus:]
Pick me up on your way down,
When you're blue and all alone,
When their glamour starts to bore you,
Come on back where you belong,
When you learn these things are true,
I'll be waiting here for you,
When you tumble to the ground
Pick me up on your way down...They say that you're a run around lover though you say it isn't so
But if you put me down for another I'll know believe me I'll know
Cause the night has a thousand eyes and a thousand eyes can't help but see
If you are true to me
So remember when you tell those little white lies that the night has a thousand eyes
You say that you're at home when you phone me and how much you really care
Though you keep tellin' me that you're lonely I'll know there's someone in there
Cause the night has a thousand eyes...
One of these days you're gonna be crying cause your game I'm gonna play
And you'll find out without really trying each time that my kisses fail
Cause the night has a thousand eyes and a thousand eyes to see me through
And no matter what I'll do
I could never disguise all my little white lies cause the night has a thousand eyes
So remember when you tell those little white lies that the night has a thousand eyesThis and who I used to be
don't matter much at all to me
The pit you dug to plant your feet's
a far cry from my destiny
Not even the clouds
Not even the past
Not even the hands of God
could hold me back from you
Dark and lonely is the ride
the devil always by my side
Though no match for what lies between
a thought of you, your trust for me
Not even the sun
A bullet from a gun
No nothing that this world could bring
Or anything someone could do
Could hold me back from you
No count of gold placed in my hand
the largest find, the greatest sum
Though some would say it'd easy our pain
we know that it can't be done
Not even the sun
Not even the clouds
Not even the past
No nothing that this world could bring
Or anything someone could do
Could hold me back from you
Could hold me back from you
Could hold me back from youDashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
[Chorus:]
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank and we got up shot
[Chorus]
A day or two ago, the story I must tell
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell
A gent was riding by in a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away
[Chorus]
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! You'll take the lead
[Chorus]Miracles, miracles, that's what life's about
Most of you must agree if you've thought it out
I can see and I can hear, I can tell you why
I can think and I can feel, I can even cry
I can walk, I can run, I can swim the sea
We had made a baby son and he looks like me
Miracles, miracles that's what life's about
Most of you must agree if you've thought it out
Well who is rich and who is poor, who has more than me
Why I have quite enough to eat, And my mind is freeShe cooks with lard,
Loves hot food bars.
A quart of sweet tea,
And fried pork skins.
Can't get enough,
Eats 'til she's stuffed.
Goes to the bathroom,
Then she comes back again.
She thinks she looks just like Madonna,
When she runs her greasy fingers
Through her bleach blonde hair.
Most times, she'll place another order,
And, Lordy, have mercy on that little bitty chair.
She's got a butt bigger than the Beatles,
Eatin' me out of house and home.
Her booty size, well, it outta be illegal.
She has a hard time, sittin' on the throne.
Hamburgers, hot dogs; cheese fries and coleslaw.
A dozen bearclaws; yum, yum, yum.
Loves sausage links; hates diet drinks.
Takes up both seats, in a two-seater car.
Her doctor said: "Lay off the bread,"
But he didn't say nothin' 'bout a Snickers bar.
She drinks sweet milk by the gallon,
And she'd never eat a salad or a lean cuisine.
Then she'll lay spread out on the hammock,
After she's done her damage at the Dairy Queen.
She's got a butt bigger than the Beatles,
Folks make fun 'cause she's overgrown.
Her rump's shaped like a Volkswagen Beetle.
She gives new meaning to the words: "Big boned".
Bagels and cream cheese; vanilla ice cream.
A tub of whipped cream; yum, yum, yum.
No, you won't find her name on the weight loss wall of fame,
Down at Jenny Craig's.
When she cleans 'em out at the waffle house,
They'll bring in more ham and eggs , oh.
She's got a butt bigger than the Beatles.
Her favorite food is chocolate ding-dongs.
It's wide enough to play line-backer for the Eagles.
Deon Sanders better leave her alone.
Try chicken that's baked, or fat-free milk shake.
Enough for God's sake: Stop the insanity.
Weight watchers, yeah.
Weight watchers, yeah.
Yeah, I watched her weight.
I watched it go from one seventeen and a quarter when I married her,
To three hundred and seventeen and a half, two-and-a-half years later. Mooo!
But I still love ya, honey.Dont you ever miss my smiling face?
Looking back at you in loves embrace
Dont you ever miss me too just the way that I miss you?
Dont you? Dont you?
Dont you ever wish you had me back?
Dont you ever think about that?
Dont you ever want me to come around and back to you?
Dont you? Dont you?
Everybodys talking bout the way youre never talking about me
Dont you ever get a little lonely for the way it used to be? Used to be?
Dont you ever stop and wonder why?
Were not really too much satisfied
Dont you really need me too just the way that I need you?
Dont you, baby, dont you?
Everybodys talking bout the way youre never talking about me
Dont you ever get a little lonely for the way it used to be? You and me
Dont you ever want another taste?
Of something you cant get no other place
Dont you ever miss it to D-O-N-T-Y-O-U?
Dont you? Dont you? Dont you baby?
Dont you? Dont you? Dont you baby?
Dont you? Dont you?I don't know how I didn't see it coming
It was too good to be true
I thought she was something that she wasn't
Ah, whatcha gonna do
It was love at first sight, love at first sip
Love at first word, rolling off her lips
Love at first chance at dancing real close with the lights down low
It was love at fist, aw, love at first, yeah
Love at first, baby, let your hair down
Love at first whisper, honey, don't ever let me go
It was love at first and now it hurts
It was love at first and now it hurts
I saw her the other day as she was walking
Another guy by her side
I wish I went on up and started talking
And gave him some good advice
It was love at first sight, love at first sip
Love at first word, rolling off her lips
Love at first chance at dancing real close with the lights down low
It was love at fist, aw, love at first, yeah
Love at first, baby, let your hair down
Love at first whisper, honey, don't ever let me go
It was love at first and now it hurts
It was love at first and now it hurts
Someday maybe she'll get what she deserves
What goes around comes around
She'll be crazy, singing these crazy words
Kinda like I am now
It was love at first sight, love at first sip
Love at first word, rolling off her lips
Love at first chance at dancing real close with the lights down low
It was love at fist, aw, love at first, yeah
Love at first, baby, let your hair down
Love at first whisper, honey, don't ever let me go
It was love at first and now it hurts
It was love at first and now it hurtsi been playin root-five for most of the night
and most of the times, well, i don't really mind
but once in awhile i get the chance to shine
and look out, baby, when the stage is mine
the good lord knows i do the best i can
on the big, bitch, butch, bull fiddle baby here i am
i got the black horsehair on my big bass bow
a little meaner than the sorrel that was on it before
sawin back and forth to meet the big bass drum
and pretty soon you can hear the rhythm section hum
i gotta buy an extra seat when i ride the airplane
or the womens and the childrens and the pilot complain
cuz it sure dont fit in the overhead bin
and leavin her behind is bassically a sin
yes, leavin her behind might save a little space
and i ain't no slouch on the electrical bass
but somethin kinda happens when the f-holes sing
with the snappin and the poppin of the flat wound stringsI know I got a bad reputation
and it isn't just talk, talk, talk
If I could only give you everything
You know I haven't got
I couldn't have one conversation
If it wasn't for the lies, lies, lies
And still I ought to tell you everything
'till I close my eyes
Suddenly I'm on the street
Seven years disappear below my feet
Been breaking down
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Suddenly I'm down in Harold's Square
Looking in the crowd, your face is everywhere
Been turning around
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Don't try to be an inspiriation
Just wasting your time, time, time
You know about the best I'll ever be
See it in your eyes
I know I got a bad reputation
and it isn't just talk, talk, talk
If I could only give you everything
You know I haven't got
Suddenly I'm on the street
Seven years disappear below my feet
Been breaking down
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Suddenly I'm in another place
Looking in the crowd I think I see your face
Been turning around
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
(Down, Down, down)
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
(Down, Down, down)
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
(Down, Down, down)
Don't you think I've heard the talk?
Nobody's going to tell me who to love
Been breaking down
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Suddenly I'm down in Harold's Square
Looking in the crowd, your face is everywhere
Just turning around
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Been breaking down
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
I'm just breaking down, down, down, down
Been breaking down, down, down
Been breaking down, down, downPain is growing like a vine stranglin' my heart
When I think the worst is over, that's right when it starts
Someone says your name, sometimes I don't feel a thing
But then there's days like today, whoa, that are suffocating
When I think it's dead and gone
Then it starts to rain, oh, and it grows again
I find myself out in your driveway
My hands are frozen on the wheel
And I can feel your love still suffocating
The memory of what used to be cuts me like a thorn
Loneliness starts rollin' in like thunder from the storm
My strength starts to sway, I feel the winds of change
It's such a paralyzing place, oh, and it's suffocating
When I think it's dead and gone
Then it starts to rain, oh, and it grows again
I find myself out in your driveway
My hands are frozen on the wheel
And I can feel your love still suffocating
Let the rain wash it all away
Can't you love me another day?
I curse myself
Cause nothin's changed, nothin's changed
When I think it's dead and gone
Then it starts to rain, oh, and it grows again
I find myself out in your driveway
My hands are frozen on the wheel
And I can feel your love still
SuffocatingClose your eyes, close the door
You don't have to worry anymore
'Cause I'll be your baby tonight
Well that mockingbird is gonna sail away
We're gonna forget it
That big fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon
But we're gonna let it, you won't regret it
Kick your shoes off do not fear
Bring that bottle over here
And I'll be your baby tonight
Shut the light, shut the shade
You don't have to be afraid
'Cause I'll be your baby tonight
Well that mockingbird is gonna sail away
We're gonna forget it
That big fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon
But we're gonna let it, you won't regret it
Kick your shoes off do not fear
Bring that bottle over here
And I'll be your baby tonight
And I'll be your baby tonightDon't you tell me if there's ever no more me and you
Just let me keep on thinking the grass is green and the sky is blue
And leave me the sweet illusions faith and hope and truth
Yeah leave me sweet illusions faith and hope and truth
If there's ever no more me and you
Cause I gotta keep on paying the rent
And I gotta keep on making the bed
And I gotta keep on walking around acting normal
And I gotta keep on saying a prayer
And I gotta keep on giving a care
And I gotta keep on breathing
And I don't think I will
If there's ever no more me and you
If its ever the last time
And you know it is the last time
Kiss me til you're convinced I don't know its the last time
And leave me the sweet illusions faith and hope and truth
Yeah leave me the sweet illusions faith and hope and truth
If there's ever no more me and you
Cause I gotta keep on paying the rent
And I gotta keep on making the bed
And I gotta keep on walking around acting normal
And I gotta keep on saying a prayer
And I gotta keep on giving a care
And I gotta keep on breathing
And I don't think I will
If there's ever no more me and you
And I don't think I will
If there's ever no more me and you
Cause I gotta keep on paying the rent
And I gotta keep on making the bed
And I gotta keep on walking around acting normal
And I gotta keep on saying a prayer
And I gotta keep on giving a care
And I gotta keep on breathing
And I don't think I will
If there's ever no more me and youYou've got me under your spell again
Saying those things again
Making me believe that you're just mine
You've got me dreaming those dreams again
Thinking those things again
I've got to take you back just one more time
Well, I swore that the last time you let me down
That I wouldn't see you if you came around
But I can't tell my heart what's right or wrong
And I've been so lonely, dear, since you've been gone
You've got me under your spell again
Saying those things again
Making me believe that you're just mine
You've got me dreaming those dreams again
Thinking those things again
I've got to take you back just one more time
Well, everybody tells me, Lord, that I'm a fool
That I should have never put my faith in you
And way down deep inside I guess I know it's true
But no one else can make me feel the way you doSomewhere in my thoughts there lives a lady
She's walking back and forth across my mind
Blocking out each chance of me forgetting
Assuring me she'll be there for some time
Her golden hair is tied around my memory
The pain she left with me is here to stay
I'm doing all I can to go on living
And yet I die a little more each day
Lead Break
Now that I'm alone with just my memory
I've had some time for counting my mistakes
And loving her stands out from all the others
But that was one I couldn't help but make
Funny how some thoughts can be so painful
And how refuse to go away
I'm doing all I can to go on living
And still I die a little more each day
She lets me die a little more each dayThe sun is slowly sinkin'
The day's almost gone
Still darkness falls around us
And we must journey on
The darkest hour is just before dawn
The narrow way leads home
Lay down your soul at Jesus' feet
The darkest hour is just before dawn
Like a shepherd out on the mountain
A-watchin' the sheep down below
He's coming back to claim us
Will you be ready to go
The darkest hour is just before dawn
The narrow way leads home
Lay down your soul
Let Jesus in
The darkest hour is just before dawn
The darkest hour is just before dawnI've had my back against the wall more times than I can count
Seems I was running into trouble every time I turned around
But now my luck is changing, I've run into a dream come true
I've never been up against anything quite like you
There have been tight situations but baby this is close
You're so soft to touch and you're so easy to hold
For the first time in my life I feel like I just can't lose
And I've never been up against anything quite like you
When the odds are against me I just laugh it off
'cause nothing is as tough as this love I've come across
When we met head on, you really changed my point of view
I've never been up against anything quite like you
There have been tight situations but baby this is close
You're so soft to touch and you're so easy to hold
For the first time in my life I feel like I just can't lose
And I've never been up against anything quite like you
No, I've never been up against anything quite like youTranquei a porta do meu peito
Depois joguei a chave fora
E bem depressa eu mandei
A solidÃ£o embora
E nem dei o primeiro passo
JÃ¡ dei de cara com vocÃª
Me olhando com aquele jeito
Que sÃ³ vocÃª tem
Quando quer me vencer
Dona das minhas vontades
Com a chave da paixÃ£o
Tranquilamente vai e volta
Entra e abre a porta
Do meu coraÃ§Ã£o
JÃ¡ sabe do meu ponto fraco
Das minhas manhÃ£s e desejos
Desliza sobre a minha pele
PÃµe na minha boca
O mel dos seus beijos
Como Ã© que eu posso
Me livrar das garras
Desse amor gostoso
O jeito Ã© relaxar
E comeÃ§ar tudo de novo
Como Ã© que eu posso nÃ£o querer
Se na verdade
Eu quero bis rolar com vocÃª
Nem que seja pra brincar
De ser feliz
Como Ã© que eu posso nÃ£o querer
Se na verdade
Eu quero bis rolar com vocÃª
Nem que seja pra brincar
De ser feliz
Dona das minhas vontades

De ser felizI was left alone
A long time ago
By my mother, who I never got to know
Faded memories of my life
Have been washed in whiskey nights
And I'm living at the bottom of the bottle
I've spent my life on a barstool all alone
Never knowing why she sent me from my home
Was there something wrong with me
That no one else could see?
What's the reason
Only I got turned away?
Mama, please tell me why
You would leave just me behind
You sent me off and then you went and have my brothers
Before me, a little girl
And they're the center of your world
Mama, tell me, why'd you leave the middle child?
I should've gone back home
And asked her to her face
But my life's become too much of a disgrace
And I got the news today
Saying mama passed away
So I'll never know the reason I'm aloneSunday morning in the valley we would gather for the service
You would always run to meet me you'd smile at papa kinda nervous
All the people came from miles around and I can still hear the sound
As they sang thanks to the Lord for the sun up in the sky
For the corn that's growin' high and for the child that didn't die
Thanks to the Lord for the crops and for the farm
For the satrenght in my right arm and for keepin' us from harm
And I say thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks to the Lord for a girl like you
[ steel + clapping ]
Come the day that we were married with all our folks from the congregation
Honey you looked just like an angel the sweetest thing in all creation
Papa hugged me and my mama cried everybody smiled with pride
As they sang thanks...
Thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks to the Lord for a girl like youLaura hold these hands count my fingers Laura touch these lips you once desired
Lay your head upon my chest hear my heart beat
Gently run your fingers through my hair
Touch these ears that's listened to your wishes most of them fullfilled and that's a lot
Let your soft and gentle hands caress my body then tell me what he's got I ain't got
Tell me what he's got I can't give you it must be something I was born without
You took an awful chance to be with another man
So tell me what he's got I ain't got
Laura see the walls I've built for you Laura see the carpet that I layed
See those fancy curtains on the window touch those satin pillows on your bed
Laura count the dresses in your closet note the name upon the checkbook in your bag
And if there's time before I pull this trigger tell me what he's got I ain't got
Tell me what he's got I can't give you it must be something I was born without
If there's time before I pull this trigger then tell me what he's got I ain't got
Loura tell me what he's got I ain't got(Hank Card/Conrad Deisler
The dollar is falling on the japanese market
The Nikei industrial average is shooting up like a rocket
Nervous investors satisfying their craving for yen
And no one is certain which state the economy's in
And now I am waking; now I'm in the shower
And here are the headlines at ten 'til the hour
Gold prices are rising in Paris and London they say
The precious metal is having a wonderful day
And now it is eight; every day it seems later
Can this be my fate? Will there be nothing greater?
I go to the office and back on the freeway and then
I wake up in the morning to the voice of Bob Edwards againHer right hand closed the front porch door
And suddenly a child no more
All the ribbons all the bows, in a box now on her closet floor
Anxious for what's to come
Afraid to leave a place she loves
She's not a woman not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
After 17
Broken hearts and rusted dreams
Sometimes make it hard to leave and
Certainty is out of reach even with some self belief
So she bites her lip and shows a smile
Flips her hair and flaunts her style
She's not a woman not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
After 17
Her memories she stowed away
Pulls them out on rainy days
And brand new faces take their place, beside the ones that never fade
Shes strong and fragile, weak and smart
Whatever the cost she plays the part
She's not a woman not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
After 17
Her right hand closed the front porch door
And suddenly a child no more.Like a wond'rous dream that ends with dawn
Your love touched my heart then you were gone
Though I couldn't keep you for my own you're the only happiness I've known
You're the one who taught me how to smile your love brightened up my world awhile
Warm and tender darling you remain just a little sunshine in the rain
You're the one who taught me
Just a little sunshine in the rainLet's turn it up loud, mix it up strong
Lean it back slow, get your feel good on
Cut 'em off short, roll it up tight
Let it unwind tonight
Drop down, the top down on the Pontiac
Where ever you wind up is where the party's at
Break out the bottle of Bacardi Black
And don't look back 'cause
Here's to the good times, here's to the sunshine
Here's to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearin'
Oh my, my
She's a little bit tipsy, leans in for a kiss,
She's stealin' your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are just a drunken star, just fallin' in her eyes
Here's to the good times, while there's still time
Well lay it all out, spray it on sweet
Carve it in oak and permanent ink
And park it way back, fog it on up
Singin' ohh, ohh
Radio spillin' from a single cab
She looks so good with her silver tabs
Hangin' on a branch by the river
That's a memory that'll get you when you look back
Here's to the good times, here's to the sunshine
Here's to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearin'
Oh my, my
She's a little bit tipsy, leans in for a kiss,
She's stealin' your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are just a drunken star, just fallin' in her eyes
Here's to the good times, while there's still time
Drop down, the top down on the Pontiac
Where ever you wind up is where the party's at
Break out the bottle of Bacardi Black
And don't look back 'cause
Here's to the good times, here's to the sunshine
Here's to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearin'
Oh my, my
She's a little bit tipsy, leans in for a kiss,
She's stealin' your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are just a drunken star, just fallin' in her eyes
Here's to the good times
Here's to the good times and the moonshine
And the blue eyes under the moonlight
Here's to the good times
Well here's to the good times, livin' on moonwine
Loving you all night, under the moonlight
Here's to the good times
While there's still timeI'm looking for that Lonely Street
I've got a sad, sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep
Where's this place called Lonely Street?
A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Where's this place called Lonely Street?
Perhaps upon this Lonely Street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love die
If I could find that Lonely Street
And just by chance someone I'd meet
Someone who feels the way I do
And knows just what false love can doThe kids all laughed at Tommy's doll but Tommy didn't care
Cause he felt so much better when that little doll was there
His mom and dad were busy doing things that parents do
So Tommy's doll was all he had to tell his troubles to
When Tommy reached the age of five his daddy said now son
It's time to trade your dolly in for these soldiers and this gun
But Tommy said oh daddy please my dolly wants to stay
But his father said now be a man and he threw the doll away
Tommy never talked much after that he just sorta went into a shell
But he never cried he just held inside all those things he couldn't tell
Then one day he saw his dolly wave from a trash can cross the street
And like a flash he darted out his little friend to meet
He never saw this speeding car nor heard this screeching sound
And before the driver knew it he had run poor Tommy down
(The people came as people do and look down at the boy
He laid there for a moment like a tragic broken toy)
Then reaching out his little arms he sat up straight and tall
And whispered with his dying breath someone please hand me my dollI came here looking for something I couldn't find anywhere else
Well I don't wanna be nobody just want a chance to be myself
I've done a thousand miles of thumbin' yes I've worn blisters on my heels
Tryin' to find me something better on the streets of Bakersfield
You don't know me but you don't like me you say you careless how I feel
How many of you that sit and judge me ever walked the streets of Bakerfield
[ guitar ]
Spent some time in San Francisco spent a night there in the can
They threw this drunk man in my jail cell I took fifteen dollars from that man
I left him my watch and my old house key I don't want folks thinkin' that I'd steal
Then I thanked him as he was sleeping and I headed out for Bakersfield
You don't know me...
How many of you that sit and judge me ever walked the streets of BakerfieldIf you loved me half as much as I love you
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
You're nice to me when there's no one else around
You only build me up to let me down
If you missed me half as much as I miss you
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
I know that I would never be this blue
If you only loved me half as much as I love you
You're nice to me when there's no one else around
You only build me up to let me down
If you missed me half as much as I miss you
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
I know that I would never be this blue
If you only loved me half as much as I love you
If you only loved me half as much as I love youThe First Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
In fields as they lay, keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel(Dolly Parton)
Say forever you'll be mine
Forever is the love that is filled with understanding
Forever is the love that is true and undemanding
Forever is the love that can stand the test of time
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Trouble clouds may fill our skies
It might even rain awhile
But the rain will go away
There's always a brighter day
Darling, I won't promise you
That we'll be happy all the time
But forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Say forever you'll be mine, forever I am yours
And I'll do anything that you ever ask me to
And I'll do what you want me to(On and on on and on)
All the things come to an end
Yes that means we'll never love again
The end of our love the end of my dreams
The end of almost everything it seems
Except these heartaches these teardrops
And this loneliness goes on and on and on
On and on and on as if there were no tomorrow
As if the night had come to stay and there would be no dawn
Love has stopped time has stopped
Everything on this earth has stopped
Except these heartaches these teardrops
And this loneliness goes on and on and on
(On and on on and on on and on)
On and on and onOh baby why not
Just take one more chance
And risk all we got
On this luckless romance
If someone asks why
We'll say we forgot
And went kinda crazy
Oh baby why not
If love needs a fool
For it to survive
It sure looks to me
Like we both qualify
And a pair of fools
Will always beat one
So let's play the cards
And get this deal done
Oh baby why not
Bet big on the bliss
And laugh in the face
Of what all odds insist
If someone asks why
We'll say we forgot
And both lost our minds
Oh baby why not
Oh baby please
You and I
Are exactly what we need
So let's throw away all care
Move out on the edge somewhere
Find a place and just swing
there in the breeze
Oh baby why not
Just take once more chance
And risk all we got
On this luckless romance
If someone asks why
We'll say we forgot
And threw our lives away
Oh baby why not
And went kinda crazy
Oh baby why not
And both lost our minds
Oh baby why notPlay your rock 'n' roll on the stereo
Push the cruise control
Disappear into the groove
Take the photograph, try to make it last
In the awkward laugh and make it true
Everyone's got their own set of troubles
Everyone's got their own set of blues
Everyone's got their own set of struggles
Walk a mile in another man's shoes
In her rocking chair, playing with her hair
Singing in the air a midnight tune
She can't fall asleep
Heart is on her sleeve, waiting on a call
It never comes through
Everyone's got their own set of troubles
Everyone's got their own set of blues
Everyone's got their own set of struggles
Walk a mile in another man's shoes
If you ain't learned that by now
Go ahead, walk another mile
If you ain't learned that by now
Go ahead, walk another mile
If you ain't learned that by now
Go ahead, walk another mile
If you ain't learned that by now
Go ahead, walk another mile
Everyone's got their own set of troubles
Everyone's got their own set of blues
Everyone's got their own set of struggles
Walk a mile in another man's shoes
Everyone's got their own set of troubles
Everyone's got their own set of blues
Everyone's got their own set of struggles
Walk a mile in another man's shoes
Walk a mile in another man's shoes
Walk a mile in another man's shoesWell, it looks like he's doin' what I didn't do
Givin' you love and money too, it's over
Where do I go from here
Well, I appreciate the nice goodbye
Not even a letter so that I
Could fool myself into thinkin' that you really cared
I tried to give you everything you wanted
But it looks like I got buried by the flame I started
Money can't buy the love we had
You can't do a thing for a love gone bad
But it cost me everything that I ever had
And even money can't buy back the love we had
Now there's nobody left for me to blame
If I could do it over I'd do it the same
I gave you my very best
You said you'd love me through thick and thin
But when one heart lies the other can't win for losin'
Where do I go from here
Money can't buy the love we had
You can't do a thing for a love gone bad
But it cost me everything that I ever had
And even money can't buy back the love we hadWho will get a song of the coo coo who will get a bark of the dog
Who will see the stars who will point to Mars who will taste the smell of the fog
Who will pick the strings of the banjo who will feel the heat of the sun
Who will whisper words like I love you when this old world is gone
I've built me a house in the country beside it I plant me a vine
How long it grows God only knows will I be around to see it climb
But if I should marry my darling and my darling gives me a son
Will he get a song of the coo coo before this world is done
Who can answer these questions who knows the facts of the case
There is a man answers in his hand in your mirror you can see his face
This world is ours for the taking or this world will soon burn away
And in you and I and the coo coo we will have had our dayCALL ME INSANE
IVE BEEN HERE MANY TIMES
THINKN THINGS WOULD CHANGE
WITH A NEW FRAME OF MIND
CALL ME INSANE
I PUT MY HEART ON THE LINE
BUT IT STILL ENDS THE SAME
SO CALL ME INSANE
CHORUS
WILL I EVER LEARN
EVER TIRE OF THE BURN
OR IS MY DESTINY
THIS INSANITY
THERE'S STILL HOPE IN MY HEART
BUT THAT PART IT ISN'T SMART
CAUSE IT STILL ENDS THE SAME
CALL ME INSANE
2 BREAKS
REPEAT CHORUS
ITS STILL ENDS THE SAME
SO CALL ME INSANE
CALL ME INSANE
CALL ME INSANE
CALL ME INSANE
CALL ME INSANE
CALL ME INSANE
I GUESS I'M INSANE(It's so good to touch the green green grass of home)
The old hometown looks the same as I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa
And down the road I look and there runs Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to meet me arms areaching and smiling sweetly
It's so good to touch the green green grass of home
The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
And down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Then I awake and look around me to the four grey walls that surround me
And I realize that I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's that sad old padre arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
And again I'll touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me neath the green green grass of homeI'll never get out of these blues alive
No, I'll never, I'll never get out of these blues alive
Well, he gone and left me
I don't know what I'll do the rest of my life
Drinking black coffee and smoking cigarettes
Drinking black coffee, yeah and smoking cigarettes
I can't see no use to try
I'll never get out of these blues alive
No, I'll never, I'll never get out of these blues alive
He gone and left me
Says, he'll never come back home
I'll never come out of these blues alive
No, I'll never, I'll never come out of these blues alive
He gone and left me
I don't know what I'll do the rest of my life
Working up a sweat all night long and jumping over my bed
[Unverified] sweat all night long and jumping over my bed
I can't see no use to try
Well, I'll never, never come out of these blues alive
I'll never, never come out of these, out of these blues alive
You know I miss him
[Unverified] to the day I die
You know I miss him
[Unverified] to the day I die(Bill Fries, Chip Davis)
Well, I found him on the corner of Seventh and Main
In the Iowa township of Sloan (Township of Sloan...)
He's tired, and he's hungry, he's old, and he's grungy
And parked in a no-parkin' zone
Well I bent down an' says "How ya doin', old fella?"
He tried to get up on his own (On his own...)
When I gave him a piece a' my ham salad sandwich
He reached up an' licked on my nose
[Chorus]
He gave him a piece of his ham salad sandwich
And reached up and licked on his nose
Old Sloan...
Well, I opened the door of my old beat-up semi
Threw an old dirty shirt on the floor (On the floor...)
He hopped in an' laid hisself down by the gearshift
Curled up and started to snore
For years we went truckin' them highways together
On the byways of life we did roam (They did roam...)
With his paws on the dashboard an' his head out the winda
An' his ears in the breeze, gently blowin'
[Chorus]
With his paws on the dashboard, his head out the winder
And his ears in the breeze gently blowin'
Old Sloan...
When one mornin' last May, four miles north a' Mondamin
I stopped to use a pay telephone (Pay telephone...)
Old Sloan made a fireplug, while I made a phone call
An' when I come back, he was gone
Well I searched forty miles of that Interstate highway
And the byways that we used to roam (Used to roam...)
From Ricketts to Red Line, Magnolia to Woodbine
But I just couldn't find poor ol' Sloan
[Chorus]
From Fiscus to Jacksonville, Quick to Correctionville
Looked like the end for old Sloan
Poor ol' fella. He didn't have no license, nor shots, nor nothin'.
I thought he's a goner.
When on a cold winter day on the ninth of November
I's drivin' my rig all alone (All alone...)
When my eye caught a blur in my left rear-view mirror
An' my ears heard the sound of old Sloan
He's runnin' as fast as his old legs could run 'im
An' cryin' for me to slow down (To slow down...)
His tail was a-waggin', his tongue was a-draggin'
An' I opened the door for old Sloan
[Chorus]
His tail was a-waggin', his tongue was a-draggin'
And he opened the door for old Sloan
Old Sloan...
Well I gave him a hug as he licked me all over
An' I threw him his old dirty bone (Old dirty bone...)
Then in through the winda jumped a poodle from Pisgah
An' she set on down beside Sloan
[Chorus]
Then in through the winder come a poodle from Pisgah
And set herself down beside Sloan.
Old Sloan...
So that's where ya been, boy.
Hey! She's kinda purty.
Aw, Sloan.The guys down at the job all want to know how things are going since I let you go
I laugh and say my heart ain't missed a beat I've convinced everybody but me
I'm all right I'm okay that's what I always say
When they ask me how I'm doing without you
I say I'm glad I'm free and if they all believe I've convinced everybody but me
[ fiddle ]
I'm the life of the party every night nobody knows I'm dying deep inside
I don't hurt at all as far as they can see I've convinced everybody but me
I'm all right I'm okay...
I smile in every mirror like I'm such a happy man but my heart knows what a liar I am I'm all right I'm okay...
Yes I've convinced everybody but meSYMPATHY
Writers Bobby Bare, Charlie Williams
Oh well, I look in your eyes
And what do I see
Well, I don't see love
All I see is sympathy
Before she came along
You belonged to me
She stole your heart away
But yet you stayed in sympathy
If you can't say you love me
Then don't say you're sorry
Please don't you pitty me
If I can't have your lovin'
I'd rather have nothing
I don't want sympathy
Do you think I'm blind?
Why any fool can see
That a-you don't care
And all that's there there is a-yeah honey, sympathy
If you can't say you love me
Then don't say you're sorry
Please don't you pitty me
If I can't have your lovin'
I'd rather have nothing
I don't want sympathy
Do you think I'm blind?
Why any fool can see
That a-you don't care
And all that's there there is a-yeah, sympathy
And it's all for me
I don't want sympathyMy car broke down on our first date;
We missed the movie an' we never ate;
It was freezin' cold an' the heater broke.
I apologized, you kissed me goodnight,
An said: "It couldn't have been any better."
Girl, if you like that, you're gonna love forever.
If you like that ring you saw in the window,
In the jewelery store down town.
If you like tuxedos an' white satin dresses,
Maybe you better sit down.
If you like driftin' off to soft pillow talk,
An wakin' up together,
Girl, if you like that, you're gonna love forever.
If you like livin' on a rural route,
Fixin' up an' old farmhouse.
Hugs with your coffee and your good mornin's with a kiss
If you like startin' a fire on a cold winter's night,
An' makin' dreams come true together:
Girl, if you like that, you're gonna love forever.
If you like that movie we saw last September:
The one you cried half way through.
If you liked that scene where he got down on one knee,
Girl, have I got somethin' for you.
If you like love like wine that grows sweeter with time,
An' keeps gettin' better an' better,
Girl, if you like that, you're gonna love forever.You tell me some days you wake up and you don't believe
Let's go climb the mountain if that's what it takes you to see
How far together we have come
Through days of rain and days of sun
It's all around you
Above and below you
Everywhere you go
It's all around you
Never ever doubt it
'Cause you never are without my love
If you need to see me cry I'll fill the ocean blue
If you need, really need to see me bleed I'll open up for you
But if you only need reminding
Let my smile ease your mind, 'cause
Trouble follows trouble
If trouble's all you choose to see
But faith just brings you more faith
We can make all the love we need, 'causeThat's all it took
The mention of your name
And all my love for you burst into flames
I tried so hard
To let you got but look
How I still tremble at your name
That's all it took
That's all it took
To make me know that I still care
It seems my heart just can't give up
The dreams we used to share
I tell my friends I'm happy
But they read me like a book
And when today I heard them say your name
That's all it took
That's all it took
To make me yearn for your embrace
I guess I might as well admit
No one can take your place
I fell for you completely
Sinker, line and hook
And when today I heard them say your name
That's all it took
And when today I heard them say your name
That's all it tookLet me live again
Let me live again
A little taste of heaven that I had before
Was just enough to keep me coming back for more
After loving you, losing you was more than I could stand
Now I'm the ghost of what was once a man
[Chorus]
Let me live again, let me live again
Reach into my heart and light the light of love again
Let me see the sun let this darkness end
Take me back into your arms and let me live again
It would have been much better that we never met
An angel's love like yours is too much to forget
I can't help myself 'cause I can't be stronger than I am
I'm just the ghost of what was once a manWho makes me forget all the other girls I've met
Sweet little miss blue eyes
Who's sweeter to me that she really ought to be
Sweet little miss blue eyes
Little miss blue eyes looks so good
I'm gonna bring her to the neighborhood
I'm gonna make every girl in town
Jealous when she's around
I'm walking the line 'cause I'm glad that she's mine
I'm living in paradise
I know I can't go wrong by just stringing along
With sweet little miss blue eyes
Who's gonna start taking care of my heart
She makes me realize
It's love, she's for me, and I really want to be
With sweet little miss blue eyesI'm gonna change your mind
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna keep on trying
'Til I can make you love me
There's never been anything I've wanted to bad
You gotta know I'm never gonna stop 'til I have you
Baby, it might sound crazy
But I'm gonna make you love me
There's a red rose
Lying on your front porch
And I left it last night
By the light of the moon
'Cause I just can't sleep
When I'm thinking 'bout my arms around you
I just gotta have you
So I'm gonna change your mind
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna keep on trying
'Til I can make you love me
There's never been anything I've wanted to bad
You gotta know I'm never gonna stop 'til I have you
Baby, it might sound crazy
But I'm gonna make you love me
I slipped a love note
Under your front door
And I wrote it all straight down
Straight from my heart
Like a song in my head
That I can't stop
Singing about you
I just gotta have you
So I'm gonna change your mind
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna keep on trying
'Til I can make you love me
There's never been anything I've wanted to bad
You gotta know I'm never gonna stop 'til I have you
Baby, it might sound crazy
But I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna change your mind
I'm gonna make you love meOh it's crying time again you're gonna leave me
I can see that faraway look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling it won't be long before it's crying time
They say that absence makes the heart grow fonder
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
But my love for you could never grow no stronger if I live to be a hundred years old
Oh it's crying time again
You say you found someone that you love better
That's the way it's happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow
Crying time will start when you walk out the door
Oh it's crying time againIf she knew that I was here with you
There ain't no doubt about what she would do
So lets get dressed and ill be on my way
You knew that I was passing through
I never meant to stay.
And I think id better go back to Atlanta
Before my conscience makes a fool of me
I never should have stepped across loves Mason Dixon line
And I think its time to go back to Atlanta
I've been on the road for a long long time
She was out of sight and out of mind
But she still wears my ring upon her hand
All that I could be to you is
Just a one night standI've done everything a girl suppose to do
When she's trying hard to prove her love is true
I've given up the things you asked me to tell me darling what else can I do
Must I fall down on my knees and beg your mercy or cry until my eyes no longer see
When I give all I can give and my fate is left with you
Tell me darling what else can I do
[ steel ]
Must I fall down on my knees...
Tell me darling what else can I doNow I really should have known
That you'd
Show up sooner or later
Knowin' every Friday night
They always have
Your favorite band
Though someone new
Is with you at our table
Would it be too much
For me to ask
To ask you not to dance
Not tonight, not until
My heart's had some time to heal
Not right now, til I'm gone
I won't be here very long
And when I leave, you can stay
And just dance the night away
But 'til then, do you think
That there's a chance
I could ask you not to dance
I saw you slip the leader of the band
A piece of paper
I knew what song they'd play
Before he took it from your hand
I wonderin' if you'd do me
One last favor
And if the answer's no
I'll understand
Could I ask you not to danceLove starts with a toothbrush
A Bic razor and a Dixie cup
A little splash of aftershave
Before you leave for that first date
I see stars in both your eyes
After that long kiss goodnight
Forever starts with a suitcase
Sneaking out the window to get away
To the car parked by the curb
Gassed up for Gatlinburg
A little chapel and a couple of rings
Will get you two toothbrushes by the bathroom sink
Everything that's anything
Starts out as a little thing
Just needs a little time and room to grow
Step by step, day by day
It all adds up along the way
And the next thing that you know
Life starts with a little house
A corner lot on the edge of town
A weed eater and a picket fence
You think it's good as the getting gets
Then she wakes up feeling bad
You both wonder what's up with that
Everything that's anything
Starts out as a little thing
Just needs a little time and room to grow
Step by step, day by day
It all adds up along the way
And the next thing that you know
One night around eight o'clock
You scrub him down and you dry him off
You pick him up and put his little feet
On the stool by the bathroom sink
You grab the crest and a Dixie cup
It all hits you as he opens up
Love starts with a toothbrushEverybody waitin' for the weekend
Getting off 5 in the P.M.
Wanna blow off a little steam and
Go cut loose somewhere
Folks start showin' up at 7
Order up a Crown or a cold one
Nobody buyin' rounds for no one
No girls dancin' on the bar in there
But in the A.M.
They go from getting buzzed into wasted
Might not remember what they're sayin'
Radio turned up and playin' loud
A honky-tonk station
Spendin' what you spent the week makin'
Ask a little hottie what her name is
The whole world's asleep and we're wide awake in the A.M.
Leave around 10 and you're all right
Everybody's cool, never uptight
But if you stay longer than midnight
You might end up in the middle of a fistfight
Cause in the A.M.
They go from getting buzzed into wasted
Might not remember what they're sayin'
Radio turned up and playin' loud
A honky-tonk station
Spendin' what you spent the week makin'
Ask a little hottie what her name is
The whole world's asleep and we're wide awake in the A.M.Here's my keys, I want you to take 'em
I think I'm gonna need you to get back home
Hold on to my hat, I don't wanna lose it
I couldn't stand for something else to be gone
I'm sure you know the reason I'm here cryin'
I think you'll understand why
[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm the designated drinker
I just lost the one that wrapped me around her finger
I need to get to where I can't think of her
So tonight, I'm the designated drinker
I came here to get you to help me
I need a friend to see me through
I hated to call, I knew you wouldn't mind at all
I know you know I'd do the same for you
I'm not the kind that likes to drown my sorrow
I may hate myself tomorrow
Oh but
[Chorus]Babe, somewhere I know I'm gonna find it, babe.
It'll have my love behind it.
And it will be a symphony of all you mean to me.
A Very Special Love Song
And babe, if there's a way you know I'm gonna say it babe,
If there's a melody I'll play it.
I'll play it through especially for you and all the words are true.
A Very Special Love Song
So don't be surprised if you're sittin' alone and you hear it.
'Cause I'm goin' to sing it to the whole big lonely world.
So turn your radio way down low and get near it.
And I'll tell the world I love you, girl.
Babe, if there's an ounce of love I'm gonna give it to you
Babe, if there's a breath of life I'm gonna live it every day for you
And all the whole night through, singin' just for youTonight's the kind of night where anything goes
What's gonna happen here nobody knows
Was a time I'd have been frightened out of my mind
But it's so alright
Alright
Alright
I'm feelin brave tonight
Just like an arrow
Pulled back in a bow
This is my moment
And I'm dying to go
There's no turning back
When I finally take flight
And it's alright
Alright
Alright
I'm feelin brave tonight
Chorus:
If I said playing it safe was ever enough
Then I was a liar
'Cause at the end of the day
Don't we all want a love
That sets the whole world on fire
Call me crazy
You're probably right
But I'm feelin' brave
Tonight
When I woke up today
I won't let nothin' or no one stand in my way
A revelation I can't deny
But it's alright
Alright
I'm feeling brave
Chorus:
If I said playing it safe was ever enough
Then I was a liar
'Cause at the end of the day
Don't we all want a love
That sets the whole world on fire
Call me crazy
You're probably right
But I'm feelin' brave
Tonight
Chorus:
If I said playing it safe was ever enough
Then I was a liar
'Cause at the end of the day
Don't we all want a love
That sets the whole world on fire
Call me crazy
You're probably right
That's the thing about maybe
It means that I might
And I'm feelin' brave
TonightWhen the rain comes down
Through the hole in the roof
And every nail in the house
Is coming loose
A for sale sign stuck in the yard
The day it sells is gonna break her heart
She knows I'm out there doing the best I can
Trying to keep these wolves away with my bare hands
We work and scrape and fight and pray until it hurts
I lean on her, she leans on me
That's what we do
When ends don't meet
When I drag it home
Dead on my feet
If she worries at all
She don't let on to me
Her simple smile can say so much
Her ten dollar dress looks like a million bucks
She knows I'm out there doing the best I can
Trying to keep these wolves away with my bare hands
We work and scrape and fight and pray until it hurts
I lean on her, she leans on me
That's what we do
When ends don't meet
We hold on a little longer
A little tighter, a little stronger
We love a little deeper
And we dance across the kitchen
She knows I'm out there doing the best I can
Trying to keep these wolves away with my bare hands
We work and scrape we fight and pray until it hurts
I lean on her, she leans on me
That's what we do
Yeah that's what we do
When ends don't meet
When ends don't meetIt's hard for me to smile I feel like crying yet I always manage to grin
Friends won't know the pain that I feel or know the misery I'm in
Everyone thinks I'm happy for I smile and never frown
But looks are deceiving and nobody knows the hurt behind the face of a clown
I've got a little pride my tears I'll hide whenever you're around
You'll never know you hurt me so for I have a face of a clown
I'll try to conceal the pain I feel I won't let it get me down
You won't have a pleasure of knowin' the hurt behind the face of a clown
The hurt behind the face of a clownWell, I used to roll and I used to ramble
Out on the wilder side of town
Every night I hear the bright lights calling
I never thought I could ever settle down
Well, I seen a whole lot of pain and trouble
In this lonesome life of mine
But you gave me love and you gave it double
And I'll always be your sweetheart of the pines
I'll always be your little sweetheart of the pines
Now you searched the dark side of the mountain
Just to find what you thought true love should be
But you found a heart that could love you better
When you got around to the other side of me
Well, I seen a whole lot of pain and trouble
In this lonesome love of mine
But you gave me love and you gave it double
And I'll always be your sweetheart of the pines
I'll always be your little sweetheart of the pines
Now you make me feel lovesick, darlin'
The way I did back when my heart was young
But I'm young enough to start all over
And old enough to show you how it's done
Well, I seen a whole lot of pain and trouble
In this lonesome life of mine
But you gave me love and you gave it double
And I'll always be your sweetheart of the pines
I'll always be your little sweetheart of the pinesYou fuckin' douche-bag!
I don't have to be a hero
I can just walk these streets
Wait around for a drive-by wake-up call
I don't have to go work just to get the job complete
That kind of work always makes me feel so small
It's your concern, it's my concern
You tell me that you love me, but love is such a funny word!
I could hitch a ride to Phoenix or up to Ontario
There'll always be a stranger with a light for my smoke
I could dream about the big time
I could play the lottery
Make my first million from a gas station scratch-off machine
It's your concern, it's my concern
You ask me if I love you
Don't ask a question, with such a funny word!
It's really funny, funny!
You let me sleep all morning
You let me share your bed
And you say that I need to make a few new friends
Love works both ways, you tell me every day
But love is such a funny word,
Oh baby, love is such a funny word
I tell you that love is such a funny word
I tell you that love is such a funny word
I tell you that love is such a funny word
I tell you that love is such a funny word
Funny, funny!We've been working real hard and the bills are caught up
For three weeks at church we've been sitting up front
Even had your Mamma over for lunch
We've been good little angles but enough's enough
It's early to bed and early to rise
Crossing out T's and dotting out I's
We've paid our dues and we've paid our tithes
But for goodness sake it's Friday night
[Chorus:]
We need time off from good behavior
Spend a lil' too much, stay up a lot later
Get a little naughty, do ourselves a favor
Take a little time off from good behavior
We've been all wrapped up in our daily grind
We'll come unwound if we don't unwind
We'll mind our P's and Q's some other time
I think a little R and R's in lineMiracles appear in the strangest of places
Fancy me finding you here
The last time I saw you was just out of Houston
Let me sit down and buy you a beer
Your presence is welcome with me and my friend here
'Cause this is a hangout of mine
We come here quite often to listen to music
And to taste yesterday's wine
Yesterday's wine, yesterday's wine
Agin' with time like yesterday's wine
Yesterday's wine, yesterday's wine
We're agin' with time like yesterday's wine
You give the appearance of one widely traveled
But lord, I'll bet you've seen things in your time
Come sit down here with us and tell us your story
If it's true you like yesterday's wine
Yesterday's wine, yesterday's wine
We're agin' with time like yesterday's wine
Yesterday's wine, yesterday's wine
We're agin' with time like yesterday's wineI see a million old memories each day
That remind me of what used to be
My aching heart tells me they are here to stay
Since you made a memory of me
I tossed and I turned night after night
Those memories just won't let me sleep
The flame in my heart is still burning bright
Though you made a memory of me
I passed by the house we once loved in
For a glimpse of what I thought was our dream
But these days I find the dream was all mine
Cause you made a memory of me
I passed by the house we once loved in
For a glimpse of what I thought was our dream
But these days I find the dream was all mine
Cause you made a memory of meShe grew up in the backwood country
Found her dreams in movie magazines
Now she's gone looking for her castle
What chance is there for a poor boy like me
City lights oh you took my darling
And the love that she promised me
After wine and big city parties
What chance is there for a poor boy like me
Sold my house to Raverend Smith last Sunday
Left my farm with Abraham McGee
Had to go and rescue my darling
From the life like your city folks lead
I found her dressed in fancy silks and satin
Spending money like it grew on trees
Living high in a big white mansion
What chance is there for a poor boy like me
What chance is there for a poor boy like meHey, maybe I'll dye my hair
Maybe I'll move somewhere
Maybe I'll get a car
Maybe I'll drive so far
That I'll lose track
Me, I'll bounce right back
Maybe I'll sleep real late
Maybe I'll lose some weight
Maybe I'll clear my junk
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine
Me, I'll be just
Fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow get me way down
Hey, maybe I'll learn to sew
Maybe I'll just lie low
Maybe I'll hit the bars
Maybe I'll count the stars until dawn
Me, I will go on
Maybe I'll settle down
Maybe I'll just leave town
Maybe I'll have some fun
Maybe I'll meet someone
And make him mine
Me, I'll be just
Fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
'Cause I'll be fine
(I'll be fine)
Oh, I'll be fineWay back on the radio dial,
The fire got lit inside a bright-eyed child
Every note just wrapped around his soul,
From steel guitars to Memphis, all the way to rock and roll
Oh, I can hear em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol guitar
Oh, I can hear em singin',
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"
Downtown is where I used to wander
Old enough to get there but too young to get inside
So I would stand out on the sidewalk,
Listen to the music playin' every Friday night
Oh, I can hear em playin'
I can hear the ringin of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear em singin,
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"
Some dreams stay with you forever,
Drag you around but bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on gettin' better,
Gotta keep believin' if you wanna know for sure
Oh, I can hear em playin'
I can hear the ringin of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear em singin',
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"
Oh, I can hear em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear em singin',
"Keep on dreamin, even if it breaks your heart"
Keep on dreamin, even if it breaks your heart
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, keep on dreamin', oh oh oh
oh oh oh, don't let it break your heartWhy must I love a heartless one who'll never know the harm she's done
Though love is blind I should have known just call me lonesome from now on
I climb the stairs up to my room but no one meets me in my gloom
The silence tells me she is gone just call me lonesome from now on
[ steel ]
These walls will hide me when I cry I pray to heaven I could die
What good is life when love is gone just call me lonesome from now on
I pray my memories at last will fade into the distant past
If I must live and love alone just call me lonesome from now onShe came on to him like a slow moving cold front
His beer was warmer that the look in her eye
She sat on the stool, and she said "What do you want
She said Give me a love that don't freeze up inside
He said, I have melted some hearts in my time dear
But to sit next to you Lord I shiver and shake
And if I knew love, well I don't think I'd be here
Askin' myself if I had what it takes
To melt your icy blue heart
Should I start to turn what's been frozen for years
Into a river of tears
These days we all play cool calm and collected
Our lips could turn blue just shooting the breeze
But under the frost, wee thought he detected
A warm blush of red, and the touch of her knee
He said you're a beauty like I've never witnessed
And I've seen the northern lights dance in the air
I've felt the cold that can follow the first kiss
And there's not enough heat in the fires burning there
To melt your icy blue heart
Should I start to turn what's been frozen for years
Into a river of tears
To melt your icy blue heartIf he brings you happiness then I wish you both the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if he ever breaks your heart if the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
Though it hurts to let you go darling I want you to know
And I'll stand by you if ever you should call
And if I should ever hear that he made you shed a tear
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
To dry away every teardrop that you cried
If he ever leaves you blue just remember I love you
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
If he ever leaves you blue...Look at your window a thousand miles away
Look at your window a thousand miles away
And you will see me and see that I am true
A thousand lonely days a million sleepless nights won't stop my love for you
I remember the sad times I had to go from you
You said think of me often and every time you do
Look at your window
Yes I do think of you often it always brings me tears
And whenever I get lonely your gentle voice I hear
Look at your window
A thousand lonely days a million sleepless nights won't stop my love for youWell if you're wondering

When you come around
Come around, come around
When you come around
Come around, come around
Come aroundWoke up this morning in a cold, cold sweat
Heart broke and beating out of my chest
I cried out your name against my will
A memory I can't kill
I buried your love alive (Buried your love alive)
I buried your love alive (I buried your love alive)
I buried your love alive (Buried your love alive)
Deep inside me, there's a shallow grave
That haunts me every day, yeah
I buried your love alive
Getting tired and I don't wanna deal
You left me holding too damn much to feel
So I found a bottle, drank some booze
I did what I had to do, yeah
I buried your love alive (Buried your love alive)
I buried your love alive (I buried your love alive)
I buried your love alive (Buried your love alive)
It drives me crazy and it makes me cry
Wish I could make it die
I buried your love alive
Yes, I did
I got what I wanted, I guess
I confess I did not want to let you go
So I buried your love alive
Yeah, I buried your love alive
Oh, no
Oh, I buried your love alive (Buried your love alive)
Oh, no (I buried your love alive)
Oh, no, I buried your love alive
Woke up this morning in a cold, cold sweat
Heart broke and beating out of my chest
I cried out your name against my will
A memory I can't killWhile they dance
How she holds him
Pulls him close
And loves him so
While he dreams of another
And counts the days
Until he lets her go
Same old story
That everybody knows
It's one heart holdin' on
One letting go
While they ride
Lord, he tells her
How they two
Will settle down
But she only hears the highway
And a voice
In some other town
And the harder
He holds her
The more she slips awayWell I work for the city in the town where I grew up.
Some days I run a backhoe some days I run a dump.
If I had other plans on my graduation day,
Then several years ago I guess I hauled em all away.
Yeah I hauled em all away.
She told me she was pregnant on the day I turned 18.
I did what your supposed to do. I bought her a ring.
He didn't have to ask us, but he asked us anyway.
We stood up and said, I do. what else were we gonna say?
What else were we gonna say?
Well I'm thankful for the things I have,
And all the things I don't.
And I've got dreams that will come true,
And I've got some that won't.
Most the time I just walk the line wherever it goes.
Cuz you can't hang yourself if you ain't got enough rope.
My boss man is mad. I did just what he asked.
I mowed the courthouse lawn watched the prisoners walkin' past
I'm happy to be working, instead of wearin' chains.
Like my cousin Willy, he's locked up in the grange.
He's locked up in the grange.
But I'm thankful for the things I have,
And all the things I don't.
And I've got dreams that will come true,
I've got some that won't.
Most the time I just walk the line wherever it goes.
Cuz you can't hang yourself if you ain't got enough rope.
There's a tavern down the highway, I go to drink some beers.
And wash down all I'm missin' by hangin' around here.
Then I drive back to the trailer; I'll makeup with my wife.
I kiss my sleeping children, and I get on with my life.
Yeah I get on with my life.I held you close to me
Once in a distant dream
Far from the shores of my fear
I sailed on this ocean
all i imagined could happen
And now you are here
It's so hard to touch what is out of our hands
To know and to trust what the heart understands
[Chorus]
Only the ones who believe
Ever see what they dream
Ever dream what comes true
Life gives us magic
And life brings us tragedy
Everyone suffers some loss
Still we have faith in it
Childlike hope
There's a reason that outweighs the cost
And gravity throws all these rules in our way
And sometimes the spirit refuses to play
[Chorus]
Oh love
Turn me around in your arms
And in this dream we share
Let us not miss one kiss
And add my regrets to the tears in the rain
That's what the color of roses contain
[Chorus]I wish I had button eyes and a red felt nose
A shaggy cotton skin and just one set of clothes
Sittin' on a shelf in a local department store
With no dreams to dream and nothin' to be sorry for
[Chorus:]
I wish I was a teddy bear
Not livin' or lovin' nor goin' nowhere
I wish I was a teddy bear
And I'm wishin' that I hadn't fallen in love with you
I wish I had a wooden heart and a sawdust mind
Then your memory wouldn't come around hurtin' all the time
I'd have a sewed-on smile and a painted twinkle in my eye
And I never would have ever had to learn how to cry
[Chorus]
I wish I had a string you could pull to make me say
"Hi, I'm Teddy - ain't it a lovely day?"
Then I'd know every time I spoke the words were right
And none would know the mess I made of my life
[Chorus]
And I'm wishin' that I hadn't fallen in love with youHey Mr Tambourine man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr Tambourine man play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into the sand
Vanished from my hand left me blindly here to stand
But still not sleeping my weariness amazes me
I'm branded on my feet and I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty streets too dead for dreaming
Hey Mr Tambourine man play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
[ ac.guitar ]
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship
My senses have been stripped and my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step wait only for my bootheels to go wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade cast your dancing spell my way I promise to go under it
Hey Mr Tambourine man...There was a time when I thought of no other and we sang our own love's refrain
Our hearts beat as one and we had our fun but time changes everything
When you left me my poor heart was broken our romance it seemed all in vain
The dark coulds're gone and there's blue skies again
'Cause time changes everything
Time has passed I've forgot you mother nature does wonderful things
I guess that it's true for me and for you 'cause time changes everything
You change the name of an old song rearrange it and make it a swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you but time changes everything
Good luck to you may God bless you I can't say I won't love again
But you go your way and now I'll go mine cause time changes everythingWon't you please turn up the lights
I can't hardly see
Thank you kindly but that don't help
Maybe it's just me
It seems I've had this problem since
My baby packed up to leave
You see she used to be my sunshine
Now we're far apart
Night is fallin' in my heart
Oh, the light is slowly fading
Skies are growing dark
Night is fallin' in my heart
Could you pull those curtains back
And let the morning in
What's that you say? Oh, is that a fact?
Well it still seems mighty dim
I guess I'll just have to live this way
Unless my baby comes back again
You see she used to be my sunshine
Now we're far apart
Night is fallin' in my heart
Oh, the light is slowly fading
And as the last ray of love
Slowly disappears
Alone in this endless night
I just see one thing clear
You see she used to be my sunshine
Now we're far apart
Night is fallin' in my heart
Oh, the light is slowly fadingI'm driving in my car alone
You called me on the telephone
How many times will it take till I'm convinced
That you're using me, I'm just a used-to-be?
It's a lie, I know it's a lie
But I just can't go on dying like this
Can I see you tonight?
Baby, I'll act just like you want me to
Or is that just exactly what I'm not supposed to do?
I'll just stop in here, have a glass of beer
I'm just a fool I guess
But I just can't go on dying like this
Here I am again, it's four AM
I think I'll play that song again
The one called "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"
And I'll wonder where you are tonight
I don't know, I just don't know
But I just can't go on dying like this
Can I see you tonight?
Baby, I'll act just like you want me to
Or is that just exactly what I'm not supposed to do?
I'll just stop in here, have a glass of beer
I'm just a fool I guess
But I just can't go on dying like this
Lord knows I just can't go on dying like thisWhile he's still around
I'm gonna take him out to fish
So we can catch up on them stories
That we ain't got to yet
And while he's still around
I'm gonna make a couple of notes
About how's love my mother
Since all those years ago
'Cause you never know when the phone is gonna ring
Sayin' heaven had it out to make you wings
And all those things that you were gonna do
Are just tear drops rainin' on a church pew
So I'm gonna try to say before I gotta pray it
Hopin' that he's lookin' down
And tell him that I love him while he's still around
While he's still around
We're gonna fix up that old car
So one day when it's all mine
He'll be there every time it starts
And while he's still around
Yeah, I want to meet the one
Watch him try and hold them tears back
When I see him holdin' my son
'Cause you never know when the phone is gonna ring
Sayin' heaven had it out to make you wings
And all those things that you were gonna do
Are just tear drops rainin' on a church pew
So I'm gonna try to say before I gotta pray it
Hopin' that he's lookin' down
And tell him that I love him while he's still around
I'm gonna try and catch a game with him
Take a road trip, get on out of state with him
Thank every memory I can make with him
Live it up before it's too late with him
You never know when the phone is gonna ring
Sayin' heaven had it out to make you wings
And all those things that you were gonna do
Are just tear drops rainin' on a church pew
So I'm gonna try to say before I gotta pray it
Hopin' that he's lookin' down
And tell him that I love him while he's still aroundwas young and so was she
Love didn't stay a mystery for very long
We could do no wrong
Then she called to say
She was late
So we took a little drive upstate
And took care of that
Yeah, we just took care of that
Now I'm looking back on
Some of my decisions
Now that it's much too late to change
How a father could have held his son
If I could undo what's been done
But I guess everyone is living
With water and bridges
My old man
He had it rough
Cause like his daddy
When he drank too much
He'd get mean
And take it out on me
So with angry words
I was gone
And I never even tried to come back home
The night he died
Momma said he apologized
Now I'm looking back on
Some of my decisions
Now that it's much too late to change
How a father could have held his son
If I could undo what's been done
But I guess everyone is living
With water and bridgesDrinkin' from the bottle and singin' from the heart
Cryin' blues in motel rooms Lord the hard times weren't that hard
And some fell in and some fell out and some just fell apart
Drinkin' from the bottle and singin' from the heart
Harlan sang us Heartaches By The Number one more time
Johnny tell us how that woman helped you walk the line
Willie sing us Hello walls cause we all know our flaws
We've been drinkin' from the bottle and singin' from the heart
That blonde there sittin' on the floor my sad song made her cry
I think she caught my zipper bout the time I caught her eye
Well she can take my body home but who's gonna drive the car
We've been drinkin' from the bottle and singin' from the heart
Drinkin' from the bottle...
[ steel ]
Now I sip my Chivits from a fancy crystal glass
A young ambitions eight piece pot band a pushin' at my ass
While we're singin' for the money I think back to the start
When we were drinkin' from the bottle and singin' from the heart
So let's start drinkin' from the bottle...You can write your own ticket now
I'll get by without you somehow
Don't you worry 'bout what I'll do
I'll be fine without you
You say you think the change will do you good
If you feel that way well I guess it would
I can live my life without you
I've got places to go and things to do
But I'll never be in love again
My poor old heart will never mend
Oh I'll find someone to hold now and then
But I'll never be in love again
Something went wrong along the way
And there's nothing I can do to make you stay
Well I never tried to put holds on you
That's the last thing I'd ever want to doI know this feeling from somewhere, I know I've been here before.
The one I love forever doesnÃ¢??t love me anymore.
So here I am heartache.
My only friend, wrong end of the rainbow again.
I was lookin' for true love but I didn't get far before
I tied all my heartstrings to some falling star.
My only friend, wrong end of the rainbow again.
Between the winning and losing there's a very fine line.
This time I felt like a winner, when I was losin' all the time.
I get this rainy day feeling that I'm gonna be blue.
I thought the day I found her I'd seen the last of you.
But here I am heartache.
My only friend, wrong end of the rainbow again.This track is an instrumental and has no lyrics.When a man loves a woman the way that I love you
He's just asking for trouble for a one way love won't never do
He can't see the forest for the trees he can't hear the wind blow for the breeze
He can't see the rainbow for the blue
When a man loves a woman the way that I love you
When a man loves a woman the way that I love youBy the time I get to Phoenix
She'll be rising
She'll find the note
I left hanging on her door
She'll laugh when she reads the part
That says I'm leaving
'Cause I've left that girl
So many times before
By the time I make Albuquerque
She'll be working
She'll probably stop at lunch
And give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringing
Off the wall that's all
By the time I make Oklahoma
She'll be sleepingWaterloo Waterloo where will you meet your Waterloo
Every puppy has his day everybody has to pay everybody has to meet his Waterloo
Now ol' Adam was the first in history with an apple he was tempted and deceived
Just for spite the devil made him take a bite
And that's where ol' Adam met his Waterloo
Waterloo Waterloo...
Little General Napoleon of France tried to conquer the world but lost his pants
Met defeat known as Bonaparte's reterat and that's where Napoleon met his Waterloo
Waterloo Waterloo...
Now a feller who's darling proved untrue took her life but he lost his too
Now he swings where the little birdie sings
And that's where Tom Dooley met his Waterloo
Waterloo Waterloo...Bartenders, barstools, and barmaids
A jukebox and a pocket full of change
Just a few of my favorite things
Bartenders, barstools, and barmaids
Bartenders will listen when you talk
And barstools are there when you can't walk
And I'll always make a waitress my best friend
Until the music stops and closin' time begins
Bartenders, barstools, and barmaids
A jukebox and a pocket full of change
Just a few of my favorite things
Bartenders, barstools, and barmaids
Outside lies a heart that's been broke
But in here it's a world of song and smoke
That way my eyes and ears can lie to me
While I drink another shot of make believeI don't need a perfect lover to hold me in the rain
Someone to ease my pain when I feel blue
If I lost you to another, think I'd drown out here for sure
Won't you stay with me and be my only cure?
Dark skies may cloud my day
But that don't bother me
As long as I can hold you close to me
I don't need a part time lover to leave me in the cold
With empty arms to hold when I need you
Tell me that there is no other, send the cold wind from my door
Give you all my love and more if you want me to
Dark skies may cloud my day
But that don't bother me
As long as I can hold you close to meYour lips are saying goodbye you tell me not to cry
But you can't stop my heart from breaking
I'll play the rules of the game I'll learn to hide the pain
But you can't stop my heart from breaking
You can tell your new love I'll smile and let you go
But what it cost me you both will never know
I'll say I'm happy for you but if you think it's true
What a sad mistake you're making no you can't stop my heart from breaking
I'll say I'm happy for youI was framin' houses in Houston one August afternoon
When the foreman's wife pulled up in her Lincoln and she said I been looking for you
The old man went home early do you wanna take a ride to town
I said I guess it couldn't do no harm and I threw my hammer down
We were shootin' straight tequila when the foreman came stormin' in
He said honey now didn't I warn you what I'd do if I caught you again
She pulled out her little pistol she fired and he hit the ground
She grabbed my arm we jumped into that Lincoln and I put that hammer down
Hammer down hammer down don't look back it's too late now
Ain't nothin' you can do about it anyhow
Just put that hammer put that hammer down
Well I heard the sirens moanin' just east of New Orleans
She cried out to the trooper thank God you rescued me
When they dragged me into the courtroom I knew where I was bound
That old judge threw the book at me then he threw his hammer down
Hammer down hammer down don't look back it's too late now
Ain't nothin' you can do about it anyhow
Just throw that hammer throw that hammer down
On a chain gang out of Houston one August afternoon
I see that same old Lincoln and at the wheel there's a brand new fool
Then the warden taps my shoulder says son quit your foolin' around
In ninety-nine years you can lay that hammer down
Oh hammer down hammer down don't look back it's too late now
Ain't nothin' you can do about it anyhow
Throw that hammer throw that hammer down
Just swing that hammer swing that hammer down swing that hammer downIn the bicentennial summer of our faded glory land a bright new face appeared upon the scene. Of an honest peanut farmer by the name of Jimmy Carter. His eyes were set on every school boys dream.
Chorus: Well the odds were stacked against him but he was not afraid to fight, the mighty facist empire lined up on the right. So shake the hand of the man, with a handful of love, the one and only Jimmy Carter.
There was joy throughout the nation, at that great inauguration, the GOP stood shakin in their shoes. Serenaded by Willie, and toasted by Billy, this president with honest peanut roots.
Chorus: Well he said I'd never lie to you, and what's more he never did. Though the times grew mighty tough, he never flipped his lid. So shake the hand of the man, with a hand full of love. The one and only Jimmy Carter.This old highway she's hotter than nine kinds of hell
The rides they is scarce as the rain
When you're down to your last shuck with nothing to sell
And too far away from the train
Been a good month of Sunday's and a guitar ago
I had a tall drink of yesterday's wine
Left a long string of friends, some sheets in the wind
And some satisfied women behind
So won't you ride me down easy, Lord ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy come, easy go
And easy to love when I stay
I've put snow on the mountain, raised hell on the hill
Locked horns with the devil himself
Been a rodeo bum, a son of a gun
And a hobo with stars in his crownEarly this morning, he knocked on my door
Early this morning he knocked on my door
I said "Hello, Satan, I believe it's time to go"
Me and The Devil are walkin' side by side
Me and The Devil are walkin' side by side
Well, I'm goin' to beat my man until I get satisfied
He says I don't do him right
That I dog him around
Well, babe, you know you ain't treating me right
He says I don't do him right
That I dog him around
Well, it must be this old evil spirit
So deep down within the ground
You may bury my body down by the highway side
... Oh, babe I don't care what you do with my body
You may bury my body down by the highway side
So my old evil spirit can catch a Greyhound bus and ride
Early this morning, he knocked on my door
Now me and The Devil are walking side by side

Where did you come from Cotton-Eye JoeTouch my heart feel the hurt the pain and misery
Then tell me again what love can do for me
If you lived in my world awhile you'd soon forget how to smile
In my world there's a million ways to cry
If you had my eyes you could see how woman changed my destiny
I'm a man who can't live and yet can't die
See these hands of mine and how they shake all because I can't break
The habit of remembering yesterday
Another love couldn't help this ache I know I'd make the same mistakes
Her mem'ry's always standing in my way
Touch my heart feel the hurt it's destroying me
I've tried but can't seem to shake her memory
Touch my heart feel the hurt the pain and misery
Then tell me again what love can do for meI was sittin' there sellin' turnips on a flatbed truck
Crunchin' on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinkin' this is where rednecks come from
She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and lookin' for the interstate
Needin' directions, and I was the man for the job
I told her way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You gotta stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me
I was sittin' there thinkin' 'bout her pretty face
Kickin' myself for not catchin' her name
I threw my hat and thought, 'you fool, that it coulda been love.
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear in a cloud of dust
I told her way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You gotta stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me
Is this Georgia heat playin' tricks on me
Or am I really seein' what I think I see?
The woman of my dreams comin' back to me
She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why, but somethin' felt right
When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Mama gave her a big 'ol glass and sent her right back here to me
Thank God for good directions...and turnip greensO Lord my God, When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!
When through the woods, and forest glades I wander,
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.
When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur
And see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!
And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing;
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!
When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration,
And then proclaim: "My God, how great Thou art!"
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!I guess you noticed there's only eleven roses
I chosen from our garden where they grew
Take the roses and look into the mirror
And the twelfth rose will be looking back at you
There's just something about us bringing roses
To a woman they say a more than a man can say
After what I've done you may not keep the roses
But I just thought I would send them anyways
There's just something about us bringing roses
To a woman they say more than a man can say
After what I've done you may not keep the roses
But I just though I would send them anyways
After what I've done you may not keep the roses
But I just thought I would send them anywaysI don't want to hear a love song
I got on this airplane just to fly
And I know there's life below me
But all that it can show me
Is the prairie and the sky
And I don't want to hear a sad story
Full of heartbreak and desire
The last time I felt like this
I was in the wilderness and the canyon was on fire
And I stood on the mountain
In the night and I watched it burn
I watched it burn, I watched it burn
I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace
I would walk all the way from boulder to Birmingham
If i thought I could see, I could see your face
Well you really got me this time
And the hardest part is knowing I'll survive
I have come to listen for the sound
Of the trucks as they move down
Out on ninety five
And pretend that it's the ocean
Coming down to wash me clean, to wash me clean
Baby do you know what I meanI`am missing mississippi miss that misty delta dawn. I`am missing mississippi how i miss my mississippi home.
The kids have grown up mama passon and daddy`s age is starting to show thangs have changed theres a big four lane where that delta cotton use to grow. But time hasen`t touched my daddys love or his hard working share croping life couse i over heard his soft tender words when he talked to her picture last night.I cry myself to sleep each night wishing I could hold you tight
Life seems so empty since you went away
The pillow where you lay your head now holds my lonely tears instead
And it keeps right on a hurtin' since you've gone
It keeps right on a hurtin' every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a hurtin' since you've gone
[ steel ]
They say a man should never cry but when I see you passing by
My heart breaks down and cries a million tears
You broke my heart and set me free but you forgot your memories
And it keeps right on a hurtin' since you've gone
It keeps right on a hurtin'...
Yes it keeps right on a hurtin' since you've goneYesterday the odds were stacked in favor of my expectations
Flyin' above the rest, never fallin' from the nest
Tuesday came and went and I'm in a little situation
Maybe it's for the best
I could live alone, I guess
Maybe I could stand alone
Maybe I'm strong as stone
Even though the bird has flown
Maybe she'll fly on home
Excuse me if I'm keeping you apart from better conversation
Hung up on all my doubt
Trying to sort the whole thing out
Tell me that I'm smart enough to deal with all the information
Spinning inside my head
Every word she ever said
Maybe I could stand alone
Maybe I'm strong as stone
Even though the bird has flown
Maybe she'll fly on homeI broke the link that snapped the chains that bound my heart
I tell the world I'm glad each day you're gone
And people think I'm happy though we're many miles apart
When the truth is I still miss you off and on
Off and on from time to time now and then you cross my mind
I'm not free as the picture I've drawn yes I'm always gonna love you off and on
I'd rather live a lie than not to live at all
But living's more than dying since you've gone
That's why I've retreated here behind this wall
Where I can turn your memory off and on
Off and on
Off and on off and on off and onSince the day they got married,
He'd been praying for a little baby boy.
Someone he could take fishing,
Throw the football and be his pride and joy.
He could already see him holding that trophy,
Taking his team to State.
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket,
All those big dreams changed.
And now he's wrapped around her finger,
She's the center of his whole world.
And his heart belongs to that sweet little beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American girl.
Sixteen short years later,
She was falling for the senior football star.
Before you knew it he was dropping passes,
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her.
The coach said "Hey son, what's your problem?
Tell me, have you lost your mind?"
Daddy said "You'll lose your free ride to college.
Boy you better tell her goodbye".
But now he's wrapped around her finger,
She's the center of his whole world.
And his heart belongs to that sweet little beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American
And when they got married and decided to have one of their own,
She said "Be honest, tell me what you want?"
And he said "Honey, you wanna know,
Sweet, little, beautiful, one just like you.
Oh, a beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American."
Now he's wrapped around her finger,
She's the center of his whole world.
And his heart belongs to that sweet little beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American girl
All American girl.Oh it's late, I know I should be leaving
We've both got someone waiting we'll have to go
And it's so strange to think that I just met you
I almost wish I'd met you long ago
In your eyes I see a certain look
And that same look must be in mine
And who knows what we might have been
Another place, another time
I'll admit in time that I'll forget you
Cause the truth is I still love her after all
But even though we knew it couldn't happen
For a moment we felt something oh so strong
And in your eyes.....Well, the turn signal's clicking and the seconds are slipping away
Just a little bit more of this turnpike and so much to say
The airport traffic it slows us to a still
You turn the radio down and leave one hand on the wheel
Well, I don't know how to tell ya what you wanna hear
You see guys like me, we just disappear
And you deserve someone who'll never leave
But girl the last few days are the best we'll ever be
Chorus:
Isn't every goodbye a chance to become
A bittersweet memory for someone
Don't you ever look back with regret
Share with me a moment for all time
In a corner of your mind
If you've never seen New England in the fall
Should you find yourself up there give me a call
But before I make my way into the crowd
Could I share one more kiss while we're still in the clouds?
Repeat Chorus Twice
In a corner of your mindWhat's happaned to us all we do now is fuss
And our love is not the same as it used to be
You say I'm untrue I feel the same way bout you
Oh darlin' please tell me what's happened to us
That old feeling's gone and we can't go on living together and yet so alone
Oh let's stop it over oh darlin' don't fuss
And we'll figure out just what's happened to us
[ fiddle - steel ]
That old feeling's gone...Beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly
For I'm a young cowboy I know I've done wrong
As I walked out in the streets of Laredo as I walked out in Laredo one day
I spied a poor cowboy wrapped in white linen
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay
I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy
These words he did say as I boldly stepped by
Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story
Got shot in the breast and I know I must die
Beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly
Play the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the graveyard and throw the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy I know I've done wrong
Twas once in the saddle I used to go dashing
Twas once in the saddle I used to go gay
First got to drinking then two card playing
Got shot in the breast and I'm dying today
Beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly
For I'm a young cowboy I know I've done wrongIt's finally come
Is that sorry on your breath?
Where were you when
I was sitting back here
Missing you to death?
It don't matter now
How, I want to know
Can you tell me plain and true
How high will you fly
Without me there to be your sky?
Well, it don't matter now
Don't mean to leave you
Standing on your own
I think back on days and nights
We had long ago
Maybe love
Is just a game you play
This much I do know
It don't matter now
It's finally come
Is that sorry on your breath?
Where were you when
I was sitting back here
Missing you to death?
It don't matter now
Now I don't tell stories
And I don't pretend
I won't be around
To say I told you then
'Cause it seems like something's
Finally broken
That'll take a lot of mend
But it don't matter now
Is that sorry on your breath?
Where were you when I
Was sitting back here
Missing you to death?
It don't matter now
It don't matter now
It don't matter nowYou can really fall
Wake up in a ruined house
Wrapped in a torn down curtain
And when I get to hell
Will the lovely girls come down
To the banks of that red, red river
I can hear the laughs
When they find I've fallen down again
I can hear the laughs
And it hurts so bad I have to smile
You can take a lot
Put back not a thing
Still come home looking thinner
And when I get to Oz
Will the lovely witch come down
Kiss my pale bleeding brow
I can hear the laughs
When they find I've fallen down again
I can hear the laughs
And it hurts so bad I have to smileCold as ice, your words cut like knives
I deserve a prize, for sticking around this long
You say I'm nothing without you
And no one loves me like you do
Always left me feeling black and blue
Well this can go on and on and on and on
But I hey I'm breaking free just watch me walk away
Had your hooks in me but I escaped
I don't need excuses
Done with your abuses
Telling me that I'm not strong baby
Hey just listen to the song cause
I, I, I proved you wrong
I, I, I proved you wrong
It's easier letting go of us
Said I didn't even have the guts
Yeah, here I am backing up
I'm taking my heart back cause I've had enough
But I hey I'm breaking free just watch me walk away
Had your hooks in me but I escaped
I don't need excuses
Done with your abuses
Telling me that I'm not strong baby
Hey just listen to the song cause
I, I proved you wrong
Yeah, I proved you wrong
Hey I'm done with you and all the lies you made
You were such a mistake
Hey I'm breaking free just watch me walk away
Had your hooks in me but I escaped
I don't need excuses
Done with your abuses
Telling me that I'm not strong baby
Hey just listen to the song cause
I, I, I proved you wrong

Oh and you just might miss it all together
Just an old BP and a Dairy Queen
Where the farmers meet to talk about the weather
It's a tailgate town
Just a needle on a map dot route
Hundred miles from the highway sound
In the middle of nowhere
Where time came and went
Flying by like a new Corvette
Oh, but we ain't left it yet
We're still kickin around this tailgate town
Friday night
Every soul for miles is underneath the light
Cheering all together
In '88, yeah we went to state
There wasn't any place that was any better
In this tailgate town
Just a needle on a map dot route
Hundred miles from a highway sound
In the middle of nowhere
Where time came and went
Flying by like a new Corvette
Oh, but we ain't left it yet
We're still kickin around this tailgate town
Church of Christ
Chairs out in the aisle
Where someone gets baptized or sent up to Heaven
And they'll rest in peace
Beneath that old oak tree
Yeah and just like me, they'll be here forever
Woah woah woah oh, woah woah oh, woah
In a tailgate town
Woah woah woah oh, woah woah oh, woah

Down to the river sideWell before she came along he was lonesome onry and mean
It was his way or the high way
But she had a way that hed never seen
Hed been livin hard and fast
All his takin was takin its toll
And it took a good hearted, hard headed angel
To help him gain control
He wore his own kind of hat
And for that folks called him an outlaw
Well some even cussed his name
Cause they couldnt see the same man she saw
He strummed the beat of a different drum
And his hair was always long and messy, yes it was
And he said he wouldnt change for no one
Except for Jessie
Well she never tried to change him
But she loved him and gave him a son
And that aint easy with a honky tonkin man
Makin music on the run
And Lord knows she was a good wife
Always good at findin ways to right his wrongs
She was the love of his life, the inspiration for his songs
He wore his own kind of hat
And for that folks called him an outlaw
Well some even cussed his name
Cause they couldnt see the same man she saw
He strummed the beat of a different drum
And his hair was always long and messy, yes it was
And he said he wouldnt change for no one
Except for Jessie
He wore his own kind of hat
And for that folks called him an outlaw
Well some even cussed his name
Cause they couldnt see the same man she saw
He strummed the beat of a different drum
And his hair was always long and messy, yes it was
And he said he wouldnt change for no one
Except for JessieThere's a slow moon rising,
It's shining on your skin.
And the way about it moves me.
I know there's no holding back, no holding back.
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this.
I wouldn't be a man if a woman like you, was anything I could resist.
I'd had to be from another planet where love doesn't exist.
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this.
I can feel passion flowing,
As you fall into my arms,
And the secret way you touch me,
I know there's no holding back, no holding back.
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this.
I wouldn't be a man if a woman like you, was anything I could resist.
I'd had to be from another planet where love doesn't exist.
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like:
Rose me baby whole nightlong,
Soul to soul baby all night long.
I'd had to be from another planet where love doesn't exist.
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this.
Baby, baby please.
Go easy on me.
I wouldn't be a man, noI ain't gonna marry in the fall I ain't gonna marry in the spring
Cause I'm in love with a pretty little girl who wears a diamond ring
And I'm just a country boy money have I none
But I've got silver in the stars
And gold in morning sun gold in morning sun
Never gonna kiss the ruby red lips of the prettiest girl in town
Never gonna ask her if she'd marry me I know she'd turn me down
Cause I'm just a country boy
Never could afford a store bought ring with the sparkling diamond stone
All I could afford is a loving heart the only one I own
Cause I'm just a country boyCouldn't roll me a seven
If you gave me loaded dice
I couldn't draw a hand
If I sat here all night
Scared money bad whiskey
There ain't no way to win
This ain't the first time
It's the way it's always been
You know the Lady's a lot like Reno
She ain't got a heart
And she don't care when your down
Just like the lights of a casino
She'll pull you in
And play with you awhile
But there ain't no way to win
I know, she's a lot like Reno
They're both out to break you
Take everything you got
When you finally win the hand
There ain't nothing in the pot
A gamble that I'm taking
But either one I choose
Lady or Reno either way I lose
You know the lady's a lot like Reno
She ain't got a heart
And she don't care when you're down
Just like the lights of a casino
She'll pull you in
And play with you awhile
But there ain't no way to win
And I know, she's a lot like Reno
You know the lady's a lot like Reno
She ain't got a heart
She don't care when you're down
Just like the lights of a casino
She'll pull you in
And play with you awhile
But there ain't no way to win
I know, she's a lot like Reno
Couldn't roll me a seven
If you gave me loaded diceBlackbird singing in the dead of night,
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All you life,
You were only waiting for this moment to arise.
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All you life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise.
Blackbird, fly
Blackbird, fly
Into the light of a dark, black night
Blackbird, fly
Blackbird, fly
Into the light of a dark, black night.
Blackbird singing in the dead of night,
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All you life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise.Come and look out through the window
That big old moon is shinin' -down.
Tell me now don't it remind you
On a blanket on the ground.
Remember back when love first found us
We'd go slippin' out of town.
And we'd love beneath the moonlight
On a blanket on the ground.
I'll get the blanket from the bedroom
And we'll go walking once again
To that spot down by the river
Where our sweet love first began
Just because we are married
Don't mean can't slip around
So let's walk out through the moonlight
And lay the blanket on the ground.
Oh remember how excited
We used to get when love was young
That old moon was our best buddy
We could'nt wait for night to come
Now you know you still excited me
I know you love me like I am
Just once more I wish you'll love me
On a blanket on the ground.
I'll get the blanket from the bedroom
. . .When I got the word that our Uncle Joe died
I did what we all did, I sat down and cried
Got into my car, headed home for the hills
Back home to Kentucky where the funeral was held
I cried all the way to Kentucky
His memory so sweet to recall
Uncle Joe lived such a good life
Love and respected by all
His jokes were the talk of the county
He knew how to make people laugh
I cried all the way to Kentucky
And then I smiled all the way back
The Preacher said Joe was a wonderful guy
And God has a project for him in the sky
His stories are binging the Angels a smile
To turn us into new ways to cheer us awhile
Joe once brought a skunk into Sunday School class
Had even made grouchy old Deacon Jones laugh
He says it's been fixed and smells like a rose
All of you good christians turn loose of your nose
I cried all the way to Kentucky
His memory so sweet to recall
Uncle Joe lived such a good life
Love and respected by all
His jokes were the talk of the county
He knew how to make people laugh
I cried all the way to Kentucky
And then I smiled all the way back
At helloween night no one meant any harm
When the outhouse was purched upon Grandpa's old barn
I think of those things when I tell Joe goodbye
A smile on my lips and a tear in my eye
I cried all the way to Kentucky
His memory so sweet to recall
Uncle Joe lived such a good life
Love and respected by all
His jokes were the talk of the county
He knew how to make people laugh
I cried all the way to Kentucky
And then I smiled all the way back
I cried all the way to Kentucky
And then I smiled all the way backYou could've loved me, but I did it all wrong
Running around, taking my time, taking too long
You were an anchor, I was wild and free
But you could've loved me
Now it's crazy to see you wearing that ring
We could've been young and dumb and restless
Could've been everything
You had your reasons
I had my dreams
But you could've loved me
Sometimes love falls in your hands
Sometimes love has other plans
Sometimes good good things just get away from us
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have any regrets
I just know it has to be this way because
I'm still exactly who I was
But you could've loved me
If it happened just right
But we rise and we fall and we can't win them all
'Cause that's just life
It ain't like the stories you see in the movies
But you could've loved me
Sometimes love falls in your hands
Sometimes love has other plans
Sometimes good good things just get away from us
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have any regrets
I just know it has to be this way because
I'm still exactly who I was
But you could've loved me
If I could've stayed
But the world kept pulling me out of this town
And it's better that way
'Cause I'm still a dreamer, wild and free
But you could've loved meHere comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
Pulling on the rein
Bells are ringing and children singing
All is merry and bright
So hang your stockings and say your prayers
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonightI been working so hard
I'm punching my card
Eight hours for what
Oh, tell me what I got
I get this feeling
That times just holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town
Tonight I gotta cut loose, footloose
Kick off the Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose
You're playing so cool
Obeying every rule
Dig way down in your heart
You're burning yearning for some
Somebody to tell you
That life ain't passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try
You can fly if you'd only
Cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Oh-wee Marie, shake it, shake it for me
Woah, Milo, come on, come on let's go
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose
(Cut footloose)
Woah-oh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose)
Woah-oh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose)
Woah-oh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose)
Woah-oh-oh-oh
We got to turn you around
And put your feet on the ground
Now take a hold of your soul
I'm turning it loose
Footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose
(Footloose) footloose (footloose)
Kick off the Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
(Everybody) everybody cut footlooseWe go on pretending
The whole world is ending
We follow the tragic and forgo the magic
I'm done yeah, I'm through with singin' the blues and
I'm learning the best things in life are free
And we're all crazy
But that don't phase me
Even in the dark
Just wait and see...
The world smiles
The world smiles at me
If I believe in the good stuff and open my eyes up
The world smiles
I've been there, the sadness
The breakdowns, the madness,
The lesson in the story that goes on before me
Sometimes I don't know
When to fight and when to let it go
I won't let the question bring me down
A little baby
What's she gonna be
She may have al the answers
Wait and see
The world smiles
All the world smiles at me
If I believe in the good stuff and open my eyes up
The world smiles
Oh, call me crazy
But that don't phase me
Even in the dark
Just wait and see...
The world smiles
The world smiles at me
If I believe in the good stuff and open my eyes up
The world smiles
If I believe in the good stuff and open my eyes up
The world smilesIf leaving was easy I'd have done it before
When heartache first knocked on that old hurting door
But knowing and doing are two different things
It's like standing in winter and praying for spring
Where does a heart cross the leaving line
Have we become strangers one too many times
Can I live knowin' you used to be mine
Where does a heart cross the leaving line
If love was a perfection baby we had it all
But when you climb a mountain there are two sides to fall
I'm coming closer and closer to gone
But I don't want to leave you and find I was wrong
Where does a heart cross the leaving line
Have we become strangers one too many times
Can I live knowin' you used to be mine
Where does a heart cross the leaving lineYou may not know it
I don't always show it
But you're so important to me
So much that we've shared
You've always been there
I hope you always will be
Chorus:
'cause you are something special, ooh-wee
Yes, you are something special to me
When I'm around you
The love that surrounds you
Brings comfort and warmth to my heart
A god-given treasure
You give me such pleasure
You are a true work of art
Chorus:
Yes, you are something special, yes indeed
Yes, you are something special to me
Bridge:
You're the wind 'neath my wings
Like the song that they sing
But there's so many things that you are
An angel in my life
You are the sunlight
And you hung the moon and the stars
Yes, you're special
Turnaround
Chorus:
Yes, you are something special, ooh-wee
Yes, you are something special, yes indeed
Yes, you are something special to me
Mm-mm
Fade:
You are something special
Mm-mm, you're something special
You are something specialDarling, you toyed with toy heart
I think you played the game right from the start
This toy heart was broken
When parting words were spoken
Darling, you toyed with a toy heart
You played with my poor heart like a toy
That toy broke and then we had to part
It never can be mended
I hope this romance's ended
Darling, you toyed with a toy heart
Now darling my time will come some day
Time alone will heal my broken heart
The clouds will roll away,
The sun will shine someday
Darling, you toyed with a toy hear
Now darling you know you've done me wrong
Your love for me has passed and gone
I'll find somebody new,
I hope that they'll be true
Darling you toyed with a toy heartIf I had married JFK
I would have lost my mind
'Cause everybody seemed to know
How he spent his leisure time
Well I guess that things were different then
A wife just turned her head
But do you think she cried
When the president didn't make it home to bed
How did she survive
That kind of life
If I were Jackie
I'd got in one of those black sedans
And left the secret service in the dust
If I were Jackie
I'd of told Marylin - you can keep that man
'Cause he's gonna cheat on you like he cheated on us
She kept on facing forward and she held her head up high
Even when she smelled a strange perfume
She stood there by his side
She'd smile and she would wave
Like she had grown accustomed to
The picture of perfection like a debutante would do
Did she ever ask him
Where the hell have you been
If I were Jackie
I'd got in one of those black sedans
And left the secret service in the dust
If I were Jackie
I'd of told Marylin you can keep that man
'Cause he's gonna cheat on you like he cheated on us
Well, I guess it's easy to sit here today and say what I would do
Yeah, but we'll probably never know
If it was her weakness or strength
That covered up the truth
If I were Jackie
I'd got in one of those black sedans
And left the secret service in the dust
If I were Jackie
I'd of told Marylin you can keep that man
'Cause he's gonna cheat on you like he cheated on us
If I were Jackie
I'd got in one of those black Seans
And left the secret service in the dustTake my lips and give me yours
Take my arms and give me yours
Take my heart and give me yours
Till we two are one
Just one kiss if we should dare
Just one love for us to share
Just one ecstasy is there
Till we two are one
There could be heavenly dreams
We take and give for
Thrillingly willingly
Moments that we live for
Take my love and give me yours
Take my life and give me yours
Take my soul and give me yours
Till we two are one
[ guitar ]
There could be heavenly....No sun on the Rockies, not even the light of day
I feel that old cabin fever coming on
But I know where I'll be when lady luck finally blows my way
She'll put the wind in my sails and I'll be gone
It won't be long before my ship comes in
Gonna sail right out of Colorado
Catch a ride on a warm trade wind to Puerta No-One-Knows
She'll find me waiting when my ship comes in
Gonna board and go whichever way the wind blows
I'll be off to find myself once again in Puerta No-One-Knows
When my ship comes in
Maybe I'm only dreaming but it sure seems real
Somehow the wind doesn't chill quite to the bone
Or could it just be the fever I'm running on an uneven keel
Not losing sight of why I'm up here alone
It won't be long before my ship comes in
She'll find me waiting when my ship comes in
It won't be long before my ship comes in
She'll find me waiting when my ship comes in
When my ship comes inSing a song of Madeleine Mary
A tune that all can carry
Burly says if we don't sing
Then we won't have anything
All the boys on ship set sail
And the mate was Madeleine Mary
When her eyes did fill with tears
It was extraordinary
It was extraordinary
For we, none of us could see it
For she kept herself below
And all her feelings private
Sing a song of Madeleine Mary
A tune that all can carry
Burly says if we don't sing
Then we won't have anything
None of us could get a glimpse
But all of us did want it
At night above our sleeping heads
Our sleeping dreams were haunted
So now my kids you'd like to hear
Of one who reached and got her
Well, if there was, well, I think
He sleeps beneath the water
Sing a song of Madeleine Mary
A tune that all can carry
Burly says if we don't sing
Then we won't have anythingLove lifts me up
When I'm down at heart
And fills me with a hope that we can start
To change the way we feel
With just a glimpse
Of something real
Every night
We hold on tight
Love makes us strong
If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong
When the world is wicked
And worse for wear
Love's the ticket
To anywhere
It's a journey deep inside
Lift you up into
The wild blue sky
A better life
Is clear in sight
So come along
If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong
What a complicated
Work of art
This power driven thing
We call the heart
It runs on pure emotion
Stronger than a ragin' ocean
Heaven knows how it flows
On and on
If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong
If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong
If your heart is right
You can't go wrongSome folks sit and wait on the government check
Some of us have the sun beatin' down on our neck
But we've all got the same damn thing in mind
An old screen door that swings 'neath the neon sign
No we don't need a reason to get down
Turn the jukebox up to ten, son, throw 'em down
Keep those long necks cold on ice
'Fore too long, it'd sure be nice
Just might have to buy the house a round
In this little ol' lonesome Dixie town
Someone throw some cornmeal down on the floor
So me and my baby can shuffle just a little bit more
But they might think we look funny the way that we move
But that's our thing and we got our own groove
No we don't need a reason to get down
Turn the jukebox up to ten, son, throw 'em down
Keep those long necks cold on ice
'Fore too long, it'd sure be nice
Just might have to buy the house a round
In this little ol' lonesome Dixie townMary grab the baby river's rising
Muddy water's taking back the land
Well this old house it won't take one more beating
Ain't no use to stay and make a stand.
The morning light showed water in the valley
Daddy's grave just went below the line
Things to save you just can't take them with you
The flood will swallow all we leave behind.
I won't be back to start all over
'Cause what I felt before is gone
Mary grab the baby river's rising
Muddy water's taking back our home.
Now the road is gone there's just one way to leave here.
I'll turn my back on what I've left below
Shifting land and broken farms around me
Muddy water's changing all I know.You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Rudolph, with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history"
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer

And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

"Rudolph, with your nose so bright

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history"Old Badger was an outlaw that no man could ever ride
So tough the devils pitch fork couldn't penetrate his hide
To beat him was the dream of every cowboy in the land
But try they might as sure is right they'll wind up in the sand
A brag came up from Texas by the name of Too Oaks Tall
Was out to get old Badger cause old Too Oaks rode 'em all
He said he'd tie a granny knot in Badger's twisting tail
So thousands came to stake his claim or to see how bad he'd fail
A mighty crowd had gathered with old Badger in the cute
The stirrups felt the boating weight of Too Oaks heavy boots
Then the cute swang open and the crowd began to roar
Cause shirt tail feet upon the seat like waves upon a shore
They circled that area Badger pawing out his hate
But Tall stuck in the saddle like his tail was made of paste
Badger then exploded as his hooves beat on the air
But Tall did stay like children's play in grandmas rockin' chair
The outlaw's eyes were blazin' and old Talls face was turnin' red
They take off to the right but wind up goin' left instead
They busted through the fence and crashed the stillness of the night
They filled the air with dust and hair and vanished out of sight
Some say they died of thirst and time turned them into stone
Others say they withered and buzzards picked their bones
But somewhere on that prairie is a scene we all ain't saw
Did Tall get throwed or Badger rode or was it called a drawShe said, baby things change
I said, but I feel the same
She said, well let me explain
Baby, how things can change
I said, but that doesn't show
How a love that could grow
Would become so strange
She said, well baby, things change
She said, Na, na, na, na, na
Now, now, now baby, don't try
To figure this out
Or ask questions 'bout why
Forever's a promise
No love can survive
And trust with hearts
Just don't apply
She said,
'Cause baby, things change
Na, na, na, na, na, now, now
So baby I quit tryin'
To figure things out
About all your hearts lyin'
Forever's a promise
We couldn't survive
Hey, I may be slow
But I ain't blind
She said, I still love you so
I said, I don't care to know
She said, you once cried my name
I said, well baby, things change
And let's don't go placing no blame
'Cause you know things can change
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
She said, you once cried my name
I said, well, baby, things change
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Let's don't go placing no blame, yeah
'Cause you know things can change
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, naOh girl I don't know what to say
I feel you love me less each day
You seem so far away
And there's not a kiss that's strong enough
I could give to keep your love
To change your mind to stay
So you packed your bags
Said you need a break
And you left me here to wait
Said you might come back some day
So I'm holding on
In spite of what they say
They say "man she's gone"
And only a fool would wait
And call me a fool
'Cause I'm a fool
I've nowhere else to be
And nothing left to do
Call me a fool
'Cause I'm a fool
And there's nowhere I'd rather be
Then waiting here for you
So call me a fool
Oh girl the time goes by so slow
Just staring at the door
Hoping you'll walk through
So if I hang on long enough
Would I be worth your love?
'Cause its something I could do
I'm just holding on
In spite of what they say
They say "man she's gone"
And only a fool would wait
So call me a fool
Still holding on
In spite of what they say
They say "man she's gone"
And only a fool would wait
Then call me a fool
'Cause I'm a fool
I've nowhere else to be
And nothing left to do
Call me a fool
'Cause I'm a fool
And there's nowhere I'd rather be
Then waiting here for you
So call me a fool
Oh girl I don't know what to say
I feel you love me less each day
You seem so far away
And there's not a kiss that's strong enough
I could give to keep your love
To change your mind to stay
So you packed your bags
Said you need a break
And you left me here to wait
Said you might come back some dayHey girl, I wanna give you some friendly advice
He's got you cryin', oh, he's done it again
He's made a date and he didn't show
You know he's done this to you so many times
When you gonna let him go?
He doesn't treat you little a lover should
He could be so downright cruel
Can't understand why you're hangin' with him
Girl, don't you be a fool
Go on and dump the dude
You know he's got a rotten attitude
He always leaves you in a cryin' mood
Take my advice, don't you think twice
Listen to what I'm telling you
Go on and dump the dude
You know that we've been friends for so many years
And I've never ever seen you this way
So torn apart, how he gets to your heart
With all the little games that he plays
Just give him up, get him out of your life
Promise me that once and for all
You're gonna tell him that it's over and done
The very next time he calls, ain't you now?
Dump the dude
You know he's got a rotten attitude
He always leaves you in a cryin' mood
Take my advice, find somebody nice
Listen to what I'm telling you
Go on and dump the dude
Girl, I know you may think this is none of my business
But the fact that we're friends, I believe that makes it my business
I care about you but I ain't preachin'
I think you should dump the dude
I don't know why you'd want to settle for less
When you could have so much more
You know that you deserve only the best
So what are you waiting for?
Go on and dump the dude
You know he's got a rotten attitude
He always leaves you in a cryin' mood
Take my advice, don't you think twice
Find yourself somebody nice
Go on and dump the dudeMy heart is sad my soul is weary
While sailing oe'are life's rugged plain
The clouds are dark the day is dreary
It seems
Angels rock me to sleep in the cradle of love
Bear me over the deep to heaven above
When the shadows shall fall and the savior shall call
Angels rock me to sleep in the cradle of love
There is no earthly friend to guide me
No one to call to heaven's goal
But Christ the savior stands beside me
To cheer and comfort my poor soul
At last the harbor I am nearing
I see the lights along the shore
I hear my friends and loved ones cheering
I'll soon be safe for ever moreI went on the search for something true.
I was almost there when I found you.
Sooner then my fate was wrote
Perfectly it slit my throat
And beads of lust released into the air.
When I awoke you were standing there.
I was on the mend when I fell through.
The sky around was anything but blue.
I found as I regained my feet
A wound across my memory
That no amount of stitches would repair.
But I awoke and you were standing there.
There's no fortune at the end of the road that has no end.
There's no returning to the spoils
Once you've spoiled the thought of them.
There's no falling back asleep
Once you've wakened from the dream
Now I'm rested and I'm ready,
I'm rested and I'm ready to begin.
I'm ready to begin.
I went on the search for something real.
Traded what I know for how I feel.
But the ceiling and the walls collapsed
Upon the darkness I was trapped
And as the last of breath was drawn from me
The light broke in and brought me to my feet.Goodbye good luck God bless you may you find what you're searching for
May your guardian angel walk with you as you walk away from my door
Oh I made my first big mistake dear when I tried to be someone that I can't
And I can't live a life any longer no I just can't be something that I ain't
Goodbye good luck...
[ steel - guitar ]
Oh you tried so hard to make me over and do something that you were searching for
And there's no use to go on pretending I could never live up to the part
Goodbye good luck...Well, I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming
Saying something about a queen
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the twentieth century
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the twentieth century
I was lying in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eyes
I was hoping for replacement
When the sun burst through the sky
There was a band playing in my head
And I felt like I could cry
I was thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
Thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
I dreamed I saw the silver space ships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There were children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loading had begun
Flying Mother Nature silver seed
To a new home in the sun
Flying Mother Nature silver seed
To a new homeSun's gonna shine in my backdoor someday sun's gonna shine in my backdoor someday
Sun's gonna shine in my backdoor someday March wind's gonna blow my blues all away
[ fiddle ]
My mama told me long years ago never to marry no boy I know
You won't give you money no decent cost what will become with you God only knows
Sun's gonna shine...
[ dobro ]
Hard times're comin' I've been told never sell love for a rich man's gold
Hard times're comin' that much I know
Love won't help you when you're hungry and cold
Sun's gonna shine...Well I was born in a small border town
And I left home at a young age and headed on down
And I started walking
Following a white line
I was on the side of a wild rush end freeway
With one pair of clothes and nothing else to my name
When a lorry would pass I would pick myself up with
A new coat of grit and a fresh layer of dust
I was dirty, fully covered
And just when the dirt started stinging my eyes
And I couldn't decide the ground from the sky
A man pulled over and offered a ride
So I took it, I ran right over
And I got in his truck and sat perfectly still
And he said 'I just gotta stop off at the mill'
I said 'You can take me wherever you will'
And I asked him 'What do they call you?'
And he answered 'Chicken Bill, they call me Chicken Bill'
Well, on account of the dirt he thought I was a man
And he reached out his mint and he shook my filthy hand
He said 'Boy, I got me a farm 'round the bend
And I could sure use the help if you got time to land,
Catching chickens, chopping their head off, locking them up'
All right, run around
So I worked for old Bill and his beautiful wife
Who would cook up a chicken for us every night
And just when I thought everything was alright
He sat me down, he said 'I'm skipping town,
Going ...around'
And I said 'How could you live such a woman behind?'
Then the look on his face helped me open my eyes
And for the first time I saw Chicken Bill's other side
He sat down beside me, all nervous and shy
And he told me the real story of Chicken BillLonely is everything you said it would be
A cup of coffee by myself starts off my day
With eyes so red from crying I can't see
The minutes seem like hours since you went away
Yes lonely is everything you said it would be
You said that I'd be sorry for the things I've done
That someday it would all come back to me
Well you were right I'm payin' now for all my fun
And lonely is everything you said it would be
The telephone at my house doesn't ring anymore
And there's never any letters left for me
Old friends we knew don't come by like they did before
Yes lonely is everything you said it would be
You said that I'd be sorry...It ain't always easy
To love somebody
You can't live without
You drive me crazy
But somehow babe
You pull me back around
Even on our worst day
When we're fighting
Like we're enemies
There ain't no doubtin'
You're the only one for me
I wouldn't get in my car
Drive across town
If you were anyone else
I wouldn't stand out in the rain
Willing to make a fool of myself
No I wouldn't give in
Just to taste your kiss
And you know damn well
I wouldn't fight like hell
If you were anyone else
If you were anyone else
Sometimes I hate you
Or at least I want to
But I can't stay mad
Cause I love you enough
To take off my gloves
And reach out my hand
I may get far enough
To let the dust
Settle down
But fast as I leave
I'm always turning back around
I wouldn't get in my car
Drive across town
If you were anyone else
I wouldn't stand out in the rain
Willing to make a fool of myself
No I wouldn't give in
Just to taste your kiss
And you know damn well
I wouldn't fight like hell
If you were anyone else
If you were anyone else
If I could imagine
Life without you in it
And forget that I love you
I wouldn't get in my car
Drive across town
If you were anyone else
I wouldn't stand out in the rain
Willing to make a fool of myself
No I wouldn't give in
Just to taste your kiss
And you know damn well
I wouldn't fight like hell
If you were anyone else
If you were anyone else
If you were anyone else (4x)Fight and scratch fight and scratch that's all we ever do
There surely must be more to love than to fight and scratch with you
You you to fight and scratch with you
Well you just bought a foal last month now you want a wig
It looks like you couldn't understand my paycheck ain't that big
Well what about the dough you lose in them poker games downtown
(I figured you'd mention that smart aleck)
Yeah and that brand new boat and that fishin' gear
But no uhhuh I don't reckon that'd count really
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...
Sometimes I swear I think that you're the devil in disguise
Cause when you're mad you oughta see the fire fly from your eyes
Well you don't look so cute yourself when you're mad at me
And if you don't like the way I look then you know how to leave
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...
Well I love you and you love me but we're always findin' fault
But the way we fight you wouldn't know we had any love at all
We just fight like cats and dogs we'll leave then come right back
For what excitement would we have if we didn't fight and scratch
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...
Why don't you drop dead oh you'd like me to and I'll live forever just for spite
Why don't you keep your big mouth shot
Well why don't you just make me if you think you're big enough
Yeah and I could whip you with both hands tied behind
Yeah you just try it with me and I'll knock your brains out
With a stick of soap that's good Catfish
What's a catfish why'd you call me that
They're all mouth and no brains boy that's really good
It's all I can do to keep from laughin' hah
That's funny you sure are a funny little fellowI'll hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms
Like you'd never been held before
I'll think of you each day and then I'll dream the night away
Till you are in my arms once more
The stars up in the sky know the reason why
I feel so blue when I'm away from you
I'll hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms
So darling please wait for me
[ steel ]
The stars up in the sky...I'd be lyin' if I said, I never prayed for this
I can show you here and now, how much love you've missed
I'm happy that you're sad, I know that sounds so wrong
But darlin' you must know the pains gone on too long
Come in out of the pain, let me dry your tears
Well he's been gone for days and I've loved you for years
Lay down in my arms there ain't no shame
Now don't just stand there girl, come in out of the pain
Well I know how, a heartache feels shattered when it breaks
And if you believe in me, he'll be your last mistake
I can't stop the wind and I can't stop the rain
But I can promise you that I can stop your pain
Come in out of the pain and let me dry your tears
Well he's been gone for days and I've loved you for years
Oh lay down in my arms, there ain't no shame
But don't just stand there girl, come in out of the painI'll be on that good road some day I'll be on that good road some day
That same old train's gonna come back again and roll all my blues away
Now darlin' you can't love one darlin' you can't love two
Darlin' you can't love three or four and still think my love belongs to you
I'll be on that good road...
[ fiddle - dobro ]
I've counted all lonely nights I've counted stars in the sky
I don't know why I counted on you I know it's too late now goodbye
I'll be on that good road...
[ banjo - harmonica ]
Now if I had wings of a dove I'd be on my way back home
But I am bound to a false hearted love till I wished I was living alone
I'll be on that good road...I know what's going through your mind you planned to leave my love behind
You're wondering how to break the news to me
I hate to see you worry so I love you but I'll let you go
First you'll have to help me set you free
Lie a little and tell me you still care lie a little and ease the pain I bear
Say you love me once more before we part lie a little before you break my heart
And now that I'm losing you what harm will make believe in you
Before a little longer I pretend
If you have ever cared at all give me a chance to break the fall
Lie a little say it's not the end
Lie a little and tell me you still careGot the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
Lucky me can't you see I'm in love.
Got the world on a string
I can make the rain go
any time I snap my fingers
Lucky me can't you see I'm in love
Life is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so and so
If I should ever let go
I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world what a life
I'm in loveI've got a four leaf clover
I hung a horseshoe on the wall
I threw salt over my left shoulder
I'll try anything at all
To get lucky with you
I want you so much
Until you want me too
I ain't gonna give up
I'll throw another nickel in the well
Tell myself this time maybe it'll help
To make my dreams come true
Just in case you're out in your backyard
Lookin' up there too
With a lot of love and a little luck
You'll fall like I fell
I'll just cross my fingers
And throw another nickel in the well
If I could get Houdini
To teach me a trick or two
Then maybe you would see me
In the way I want you to
Gonna knock on wood
It ain't been easy
I've done everything I could
To make you need me
I'll throw another nickel in the well
Tell myself this time maybe it'll help
To make my dreams come true
Just in case you're out in your backyard
Lookin' up there too
With a lot of love and a little luck
You'll fall like I fell
I'll just cross my fingers
And throw another nickel in the well
With a lot of love and a little luck
You'll fall like I fell
I'll just cross my fingers
And throw another nickel in the well
Yeah, just cross my fingers
And throw another nickel in the wellWe know this love that we're stealing is hopeless and we'll never win
Yeah you know and I know we're helpless so the eyes of the world can't come in
Tonight we can dream of the future but we know tomorrow can't be
For now let's don't talk about her right now you belong to me
She doesn't know that she's keeping us apart
And she doesn't mean to break her heart
In the eyes of the people around us we would be committed a sin
But we need the love that surrounds us so the eyes of the world can't come inAfter you have known me better and the new wears off
Will you want me, just as much as you do now?
After I am your possession, will the thrill be gone?
Will you want me then, as much as you do now?
How long, does forever mean to you?
Does it mean, you'll always love me? Or is it just a line you use?
After I am yours completely, will you change your mind?
Will you want me, just as much as you do now?
How long, does forever mean to you?
Will you want me then, as much as you do now?How Did You Do It

Album: I Turn The Page
You don't seem to be doing all that bad
In fact you look good
You don't seem to be feeling all that sad
Like I thought maybe you would
CHORUS:
How, how did you do it
How did you let it go
How, how did you do it
I need to know
Now you've got friends to help you when you're sad
There's even someone you've been seeing
Now I know there's nothing wrong with that
In fact it's a good thing
CHORUS:
How, how did you do it
How did you let it go
How, how did you do it
I need to know
One last question before you go
If you're really over you and me
How did you get there, I need to know
Cause that's where I'd like to be
CHORUS:
How, how did you do it
How did you let it go
How, how did you do it
I need to know
CHORUS:
How, how did you do it
How did you let it go
How, how did you do it
I need to knowIt's hard describing a heartache
All because it's a one of a kind of thing
A serious injury
And a whole lot of endless pain
If it was a storm
I'd compare to a hurricane
Oh it's even got a name
If it was a drink
It would be a strong one
If it was a sad song
It would be a long one
If it was a color
It would be a deep deep blue
But if we're talking about a heartache
It would be you
If it was a full moon
It would be a total eclipse
If it was a tidal wave
It would sink a thousand ships
If it was a blizzard
It would be a record breaking cold
If it was a lie
It would be the biggest story you've ever told
If it was a drink
It would be a strong one
If it was a sad song
It would be a long one
If it was a color
It would be a deep deep blue
But if we're talking about a heartache
It would be youFunny how the circle turns around
First your up and then your down again
Though the circle takes what it may give
Each time around it makes you live again
Funny how the circle is a wheel
And it can steal someone who is a friend
Funny how the circle takes your flight
And if it's it right it brings you back again
Funny how the circle turns around
You think your lost and then you're found again
Though you always look for what you know
Each time around it's something new againChicken every Sunday mama everything's all right
Johnny was just a little boy the day his daddy died
And his mama had a hard time keepin' them both but the Lord knows how she tried
And sometimes she'd tell him son we got heaven on our side
There's chicken every Sunday Johnny everything's all right
Although he was just a little lad he never did forget
His mama special way of sayin' how their little home was blessed
And sometimes she would said when she said her prayers at night
She'd bowed her head and said chicken every Sunday Lord and everything's all right
Well Johnny grew to be a man and his mama passed away
And this fate would have happened Johnny's the rich man today
In fact they held the dinner to honor Johnny's name
And with his fame and his riches you might think that Johnny had changed
But thirty rich men sat around and passed the golden cup
And Johnny God bless his honor looked around and then stood up
Thirty rich men bowed their heads and everything grew quiet
And Johnny said chicken every Sunday mama everything's all right
Chicken every Sunday mama everything's all rightGot my eye on a boy
He's eyeing me back
It's looking real good
This could be it
And I know that all of you girls
Would love to steal him away
He bought me a drink
I thanked him real sweet
It's always so nice when you first meet
And I know that all of you women would love to steal him away
So I'm warning you
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Building up an appetite
You can look but you can't buy
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Pretty as a picture
Comin' on so strong
He's twisting my ignition key
Turn my motor on
But anyone can see, all his attention's on me
Give us some privacy
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Better keep your hands off my
It's a welcome turn to try
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Leave us alone tonight
Then if it don't work out right
He's all your's
Until then
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
They keep crowdin' in on me
He smiles rather unsuspiciously
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Building up an appetite
You can look but you can't buy
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriendWe've been friends for a long long time
You tell me your secrets and I tell you mine
She's left you all alone and you feel like no one cares
But I have never failed you I've always been there
You tell your story it sounds a bit like mine
It's the same old situation it happens every time
Can't we see oh maybe you and me
Is what's meant to be
Or do we disagree
What if I told you (what if I said)
That I loved you
How would you feel
What would you think
What would we do
Do we dare cross that line
Between your heart and mine
Or would I lose a friend
Or find a love that would never end
What if I said
She doesn't love you
Oh it's plain to see
I can read between the lines of what your telling me
And he doesn't hold you the way a woman should be held
How long can I go on keeping these feelings to myself
What if I told you -(what if I said)
That I loved you
How would you feel
What would you think
What would we do
Do we dare cross that line
Between your heart and mine
Or would I lose a friend
Or find a love that would never end
What if I said
Oh we've both had our share of loneliness
So who's to say we can't have a little happiness
And if I found that in you
It would make my dreams come true
Or would you walk away
Hear what I have to say
What if I told you -(what if I said)
That I loved you
How would you feel
What would you think
What would we do
Oh do we dare cross that line
Between your heart and mine
I've always wondered
From that day that we met
What if I said
What if I said
Oh
What if I saidMy grandpa gave me a wee penny and I kept it in my pocket
I had big plans in my backyard to build me a space rocket
I talked to my brother on a fake C-P that I made from a Tic-Tac box
Packed my snowballs nice and tight and in the middle I put rocks
Don't trade in your Tic-Tac box for a ball on the end of a chain
And don't go spending Grandpa's pennies buying into the game
You gotta keep your heart young
Don't go growin' old before your time has come
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart young
Dad took the wheels off of my bike and he pushed me down the hill
But speed got the best of me and I took my first spill
That was back when alcohol was only used on cuts
Stung like hell so I shook my leg and mama said it would give me guts
Don't trade in your Tic-Tac box for a ball on the end of a chain
And don't go spending Grandpa's pennies buying into the game
You gotta keep your heart young
Don't go growing old before your time has come
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart young
So take a picture of the one you love and put it in a locket
Go dig up your time capsule and the blueprints for your rocket
Keep in touch on a fake C-P and that same old Tic-Tac box
Pack your snowballs a little less tight but in the middle still put rocks
And keep your heart young
Don't go growing old before your time has come
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart young
You gotta keep your heart young
Sometimes you don't die quick
Just like you wished you'd done
Though love is a loaded gun
You've gotta keep your heart young
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart youngThey gave him his orders at Monroe Virginia
Sayin' Steve you're way behind time
This is not '38 but this it's old '97
You must put her in Spencer on time
He turned around and said to his black greasy fireman
Just shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross that White Oak Mountain
You can watch old '97 roll
He was goin' down the grade makin' ninety miles an hour
His whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
A scalded to death by the steam
It's a mighty rough road from Lynchburg to Danville
With a line on a three mile grade
It was on this grade that he lost his air brakes
And he see what a jump we made
He was goin' down the grade
So come on you ladies you must take a warning
From this time on and learn
Never speak harsh words to your true loving husband
He may leave you and never returnWho's in Houston that's keepin' you from talkin' to me
I ain't used to layin' down without the sound of your voice
Before I drift off to sleep
Girl, you got me climbin' the walls
If you can't find the time to call
Come on and text me, Texas
Before you turn off your phone
I'm a wreck and I'm restless
Got a feelin' that you're not alone
It's breakin' my heart and I'm startin' to get the message
Come on and text me, Texas
I pray what you ain't sayin' don't mean what all my friends say it means
Maybe you can give me just a couple of lines that I can read between
You could even tell me a lie
Anything to get me by
Come on text me, Texas
Before you turn off your phone
I'm a wreck and I'm restless
Got a feelin' that you're not alone
Yeah it's breakin' my heart and I'm startin' to get the message
Come on and text me Texas
Whatever you can't tell me now
Baby, you could spell it out
Come on and text me, Texas
Before you turn off your phone
I'm a wreck and I'm restless
Got this feelin' that you're not alone
Yeah it's breakin' my heart and I'm startin' to get the message
Come on and text me TexasLove it's not I who didn't try
Hard enough, hard enough
And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough
Love you don't see
The pain in me
That's plain enough, plain enough
You're never here to catch the tears
I cried for us, I cried for us
I'll take my share but I'll be fair
There's not much stuff
Easy enough
And if you choose I'll break the news
This part is tough, so very tough
I've tried and tried to put aside
The time to talk, but without luck
So I'll just pin this note within your coat
And leave the garden gate unlockedStraight up strong and steady
Hard falls I don't take any
Both feet right beneath me
Firmly on the ground
But each time I see you comin'
The earth moves
Girl you're somethin'
I start right into stumblin'
Catch me now
I'm heart over head over heels over you
Look at what I fell into
You throw me girl like a tumbleweed on a Tilt-A-Whirl
I'm all turned around, got my down side up
Either way it looks like what they say about true love's true
'Cause I'm heart over head over heels over you
I need you to hold me real tight
Next thing you know I just might
Break loose and I could fly right into the stratosphere
Oh girl, are you with me
Do you feel a little dizzy
This view is a thing of beauty
Way up here
I'm heart over head over heels over you
Look at what I fell into
You throw me girl like a tumbleweed on a Tilt-A-Whirl
I'm all turned around, got my down side up
Either way it looks like what they say about true love's true
'Cause I'm heart over head over heels over youTHE TRUTH IS I LIED
Writers Bill Anderson, Skip Ewing
RECORDED BY GENE WATSON AND BY RICOCHET
I said it was over
I said we were through
I said when I left I
Was done loving you
But I'm fighting a feeling
that cant be denied
Forget what I told you
the truth is I lied
I know you weren't expectin'
This visit from me
With my hat in my hand and
My heart on my sleeve
But I've stopped my pretending
And I've swallowed my pride
I'm not above saying
The truth is I lied
The truth is I'm not quite as strong as
I thought this battle is harder
than an war that we've fought
I said I could just push your memory aside
I meant it when I said it but the truth is i lied
is it asking to much to forget and forgive
Dying for your love
Is no way to live
and the truth is I'm just not as strong as I thought
this battle is harder
Than any war that we've fought
I said I could just push your memory aside
I meant it when I said it but the truth is I lied
Oh, I meant it when I said it, the truth is I liedBaby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey baby
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She's poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
It'd look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
She was sippin' on southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
It'd look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Cause it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right
I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell I can't get you out of my head
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
It'd look a hell lot better with you up in it
Come on
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Come on girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aw yea4 o'clock in the morning, city lights
Like diamonds lighting up the night
The party's over but we're not
Take a taxi down to the water
Moon is out, but it's getting hotter
It's been hours now, haven't had a drop
And this feeling won't stop
Yeah, you're my champagne, baby you go straight to my head
Just one taste, I'm about as high as I can get
Words tripping, heart skipping
One look and my world's spinning out
You're my champagne
You're my champagne
Long walk home cut through the park
Give away our secrets underneath the stars
Getting lost, but we laugh it off
Don't got cash, but we got time to spend
Don't stop, don't want this night to end
Wanna drink it up, every sip of you
Yeah you're my champagne, baby you go straight to my head
Just one taste, I'm about as high as I can get
Words tripping, heart skipping
One look and my world's spinning out
You're my champagne
You're my champagne
No, I'll never get enough of you
Yeah, you're my champagne, baby you go straight to my head
My Champagne, (my champagne) baby you go straight to my head
Just one taste, I'm about as high as I can get
Words tripping, heart skipping
One look and my world's spinning out
You're my champagne
You're my champagneDon't know why there's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time
Life is bare, gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor old self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all the time
When she went away, the blues walked in and they met me
If she stays away, that old rockin' chair's gonna get me
All I do is pray the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more
Can't go on, everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time
Keeps rainin' all the time
[all backups](When she went away, the blues walked in and met
me)
[female backups only] (If he stays away, old rockin' chair will
get me)
[all backups] (All I do is pray the Lord above will let me)
[all backups] (Walk in the sun once more)
Can't go on, everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time, the time
Keeps rainin' all the timeHere I am all worn down to the muscle the bone
Done all I can
Seems like everything I do turns into don't
Still I stand still I try
And I know I'm gonna get it wrong it's alright
When the wheels come off
And somewhere between the shoulder and the ditch
Neither found nor lost
And I can't say I'll ever know which is which
There's a road and so I drive
And I know I'm gonna get it wrong it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
It's alright if I find a thousand ways
Just to fall from grace
Got a true blue heart
But every now and then it must get beat
And if it falls apart
And shatters like a whiskey glass around my feet
Pick it up one more time
And I know I'm gonna get it wrong
Yeah I know I'm gonna get it wrong it's alrightHere's a man of sorrows, children
As constant as the sea
Searching for a heart
That's lost it's stone.
She moves like a serpent, baby
Through time she drags her tail
Of all the broken hearted
Left behind.
Let's just sit here a little bit longer
With these bruised and battered hearts
Let's just say they were damaged
From the start.
There they go like shadows, darling
Between this world and that
Never knowing where the light
Will shine.
But I can tell you one thing, sweetheart
We share a place in time
Nothing more is needed
'cause you're mine.
Let's just sit here a little bit longer
With these bruised and battered hearts
Let's just say they were damaged
From the start.
Such a perfect pairing, dear one,
The Pacific and it's rock
A battle weighed on scales
We can not know.
Let's just sit here a little bit longer
Oh how we broke each others hearts
Let's just say they were damaged
From the start.
Let's just sit here a little bit longer
These scarred and healing hearts
Let's just say they were damaged
From the start.Beautiful night
Stars shining down
All of God's glory
All around
The rains gone away
And there's no clouds in sight
We're singing His praises
This beautiful night
The moon's glowing silver
Down on blue water
Sweet meditation bathes me in white
I feel His spirit and I relive creation
I feel His blessings
This beautiful night
chorus: Beautiful night
Stars shining down
All of God's glory
All around
The rains gone away
And there's no clouds in sight
We're singing His praises
This beautiful night
Quiet takes over, blends with our voices
Just stillness and prayer
While the angels unite
He is our rock He is our refuge
He is our savior
This beautiful night
(repreat chorus)
And when morning breaks
His light again shines
Fulfilling our souls
So warm and so bright
But come again evening
We'll gather our loved ones
And lift up our voices
This beautiful night
(repeat chorus)
(repeat chorus and fade)You can put it in the bank, hide it in a jar
Scrap it up, save it up for a rainy day or blow it on a car
It doesn't matter if you're rich or just plain dirt poor
Totally set, swimming in debt
Everybody wants a little more
Moola, Greenback, Bread, Dough, Cash, Yeah Money

Houses, Boats, Cars Ka-Ching, Money
Then Benjamin Franklins, Abraham Lincolns, Hamilton's, Washington's
I know what you're thinking, Money.
You can bet on a race, win it in the mail
Do a lot of bad stuff and if ya got enough
It'll keep you out of jail
It'll rent a limousine, drive you to the mall downtown
Where you can eat til you pop or shop til you drop
But don't leave how without

Gotta have Gold, Pearls, Diamond Rings
Houses, Boats, Cars Ka-Ching, Money
Then Benjamin Franklins, Abraham Lincolns, Hamiltons, Washington's
I know what you're thinking, Money
It's printed, stacked and stamped
Before it gets to you and me
It might be made out of wood
But it don't grow on trees
Moola, Greenback, Bread, Dough, Cash, Yeah Money
Gotta have Gold, Perals, Diamond Rings
Houses, Boats, Cars Ka-Ching, Money
Then Benjamin Franklins, Abraham Lincolns, Hamilton's, Washington's
I know what you're thinking, MoneyI filled up two shopping carts late last night
The one was full of fishing gear, the other Miller Lite
The checkout-lady laughed and said 'You think you got enough'
And I said 'Yeah, You're probably right', and filled another two carts up
Gonna catch all the fish
Gonna drink all the beer
Gonna head outta town
We're not staying here
Might take all day
Might take all year
Till we catch all the fish
Till we drink all the beer
So I picked up the boys at dawn and we were on our way
It hadn't been ten minutes before Jimmy's cellphone rang
His old lady asked him how we'd be on the lake
And I said You tell her 'We're staying here however long it takes'
Gonna catch all the fish
Gonna drink all the beer
Better warn her now
Better make it clear
Might take all day
Might take all year
Till we catch all the fish
Till we drink all the beer
Just as long as there's a can left in that cooler
Just as long as there's a bass left in that lake
That just means we still got some work to do here
Just as long as there's still gas left in that tank
As long as there's a can left in that cooler
As long as there's a bass left in that lake
That just means that we still got some work to do here
As long as there's still gas left in that tank
Well, we caught all the fish
And we drank all the beer
And we ran outta gas
Now we're stuck out here
With lots of empty cans
And worthless fishing gear
'Cause we drank all the fish
And we caught all the beer
Well, I mean we caught all the fish
And drank all the beerIt used to be that
You could up and thumb a ride from Nashville to L.A.
And everyone who stopped and picked you up
Would get you high along the way
And it used to be that
You could fall in and out of love in an afternoon
And then fall again that evening
And not think that it was happening too soon
[Chorus]
But it's hard to be a hippie anymore
It hurts more now
Waking up on the floor
Oh, it's still free
But it ain't easy like before
It's hard to be a hippie anymore
Fire it up boys
It used to be just walking down the street
Would make the people stop and stare
Now all the cowboys and the preppies
And the rednecks and the yuppies have long hair
But I was always going places
In my head and seeing things that blew my mind
Now the only thing I'm trippin' on
Are my own two feet, trying to keep up with the times
Ah yeah, you know that's right
[Chorus]
But it's hard to be a hippie anymore
It hurts more now
Waking up on the floor
Oh, it's still free
But it ain't easy like before
It's hard to be a hippie anymore
Lord, it's still free
But it ain't easy like before
It's hard to be a hippie anymoreBad news travels like wild fire good news travels slow
They all call me a Wildfire cause everybody knows
That I'm bad news everywhere I go
Always a gettin' in the trouble ha ha ha
And leavin' little girls who hate to see me go
I've picked peaches down in Georgia lumber-jacked up in Maine
I've been hired and jailed in every state you can name
Because I'm bad news
From north to south from east to west the story is the same
From one state to the other I have to change my name
Because I'm bad news
Now they tried to hang me down in Oakland and they did in San Frisco
But I wouldn't choke and I broke their rope they had to let me go
Because I'm bad newsYeah that's my old girlfriend
Saw her when she walked in
Her hair's a little longer but she's still lookin' stronger than sin
No, I don't care if you buy her a drink
But she's not the kind of girl you think
Oh, cause back when we were lovin' she thought cowboys were something
Now' they ain't
Cause she's over buckles
She's over spurs
To her you're just a heartache in a pearl snap shirt
Been lassoed and let go for the last time
No, she ain't just over me, she's over me and my kind
I guess I ruined it for the rest of us
When I left her standing in my dust
Oh, and lately she's been hating rodeos and Copenhagen
And trucks, ha-ha
Yeah she's over buckles
She's over spurs
To her you're just a heartache in a pearl snap shirt
Been lassoed and let go for the last time
No she ain't just over me, she's over me and my kind
Yeah she's over buckles
She's over spurs
To her you're just a heartache in a Wrangler pearl snap shirt
Lassoed and let go for the last time
She ain't just over me, she's over me and my kind
She ain't just over me, she's over me and my kindGood morning captain good morning son
Do you need another mule skinner
Out on your new road line
Well I like to work
I'm rolling all the time
Lord I like to work boy
I'm rolling all the time
I can pop my initials
Right on a mule's behind
Well it's hey little water boy bring your water 'round
Lord it's hey little water boy bring your water 'round
And if you don't like your job just set that water bucket down
I work out on the new road from a dollar and a dime a day
Lord I work out on the new road I make a dollar and a dime a day
I've got three women on Saturday night
Waiting to draw my pay
Well I'm going to town honey what can I bring you back
Well I'm going to town baby what can I bring you back
Just bring a pint of good rye
And a John B.Stetson hat
Lord it's raining here and it's storming on the deep blue sea
Lord it's raining here and it's storming on the deep blue sea
Can't no blonde headed woman make a monkey out for me
If your house catches fire and there ain't no water 'round
If your house catches fire and there ain't no water 'round
Just throw your good gal out the window let your house just burn on down
Well I'm leaving here and I ain't gonna take no clothes
I'm leaving here and I ain't gonna take no clothes
There may be good times in this old town but it's better on down the roadTell me that you love me
Say "we'll always work it out"
I know it's kinda scary
But it's only temporary doubt
I've done a lot of stupid things
But promise that you're gonna stay long enough to grow old with me
We're gonna see the good times love each other through the bad
It's gonna hurt like hell when we lose our moms and dads
So let my shoulder hold your tears
Walk beside me through the years
Baby let's see, where this love could lead
Let's hold hands on your favorite beach
Fix up a house that we found in the city limits
Tangled up in a satin sheet
And get a little loud when we've had to much to drink
And learn to love from a church pew
Laugh about all the times we counted pennies
Buy some land with a good view
To start a family
Baby grow old with me
It's gonna take a little time we'll have to work at it everyday
We're gonna lose a lot of sleep and learn to eat out of a microwave
You know we'll probably never have it all
But that's part of building up the walls strong enough to stand up through the rain
We'll make some love on your favorite beach
And at the house that we found in the city limits
Talk our babies through the bad dreams
When they get a little older we'll tell them not to drink
Book a church when she finds a groom
Laugh about all the times they'll count the pennies
Give them land with a good view
To start a familyFor your love
I'd rope the moon
And put it
In a blender
Mix up a conception
That might
Make you surrender
I'd bide the brand
Off a buckin' branded bull
Rob me a gin mill
I'd fill the ocean full
I'd take on the army
Her majesty's marine
Your love
Ain't just a cover
It's a whole magazine
For your love
I'd stop a freight train
Single handed
Spreadin out the bins
In the Rio Grande
I'd climb the tower
At the TV station
Broadcast my affection
To the united nation
I'd take on the governor
In Washington DC
Your love
Ain't just an engine
It's a rockin' machine
[Chorus]
For your love
I'd stop the hands of time
For your love
I'd dig a diamond mine
For your love
I'd do it all the time
Yes I would
For your love
I'd walk a tight rope
And wrestle anacondas
Jump a motorcycle
Over half a dozen Hondas
Carve your initials
On a forest of bamboo
Paint the Brooklyn bridge
Baby paint with a broom
I'd take on the press
From Tokyo to Prada
Your love ain't just
A hot sauce
It's a whole enchilada
[Chorus]
Yeah nowSearching, I've spent a lifetime, darling
Searching, looking for someone like you
Dreaming, in all my dreams I dream that someday
I'd find
Someone like you
Other loves have come my way
But they were not for me
Tell me that you're here to stay
Don't ever set me free
'Cause I've been searching
I've spent a lifetime, darling
Searching, looking for someone just like you
Other loves have come my way
But they were not for me
Tell me that you're here to stay
Don't ever set me freeJust how far does the universe go
Does it ever end, you say you want to know
Just how high can you count
Before the numbers all runs out
Who built the Pyramids
Do aliens exist
Where does God come from
One more phenomenon
But if you know how strong my love is
And your heart and mind can comprehend
Just how long I'm gonna feel like this
Then you'll know what infinity is
Then you'll know
They say that time goes on and on
Even after we're long gone
And there's a black hole up in space
That pulls so strong, light can't escape
They'll find the answers to all those mysteries
But they won't understand what's between you and meI don't need another drink of Johnny Walker Red
And I don't need another drag off a Marlboro cigarette
And I don't need me telling myself everything's gonna be alright
And I don't need me lying here alone again tonight
I need my girl, I need my baby
I need you, ninety miles an hour down the interstate
Headlights shining in the driveway
In my arms, and I need you right now
I don't need nothing else, baby, in this world
I just need my girl
I don't need those buddies of mine taking me on the town
Or a TV preacher warning me bout the road I'm going down
I don't need to let 'I'm sorry' not roll off my lips
And I don't need to let my pride talk me out of this
I need my girl, I need my baby
I need you, ninety miles an hour down the interstate
Headlights shining in the driveway
In my arms, and I need you right now
I don't need nothing else, baby, in this world
I just need my girl
Like I never needed anything before
Like my life depends on you walking through that door
I need you, girl
Oh, I need you, girl
I need my girl, I need my baby
I need you, ninety miles an hour down the interstate
Headlights shining in the driveway
In my arms, and I need you right now
I don't need nothing else, baby, in this world
I just need my girl
I just need my girl
I just need my girl
I just need my girlCutting hay in a nowhere town
Sun up to sundown
Making that summertime money
Damn it was hot as hell
Stacking it bail by bail
Come quitting time man I was running
Little sweat on my shirt
Little sun on my burn
Little hard in that work
But it was worth it
'Cause it put gas in the tank
Put a little smoke in that tray
Put a little feel good in our crazy
Put a little 5th on ice
Put a little look in her eye
Sure bought a lot of time with my baby
Got us out on the edge of town
She'd light me up, I'd lay her down
Those nights got hotter
Spending those blue collar dollars
Those blue collar dollars
That dusty red clay was on my boots and my face
Still I showed up everyday
Praying for Friday
Putting that pedal to the floor
Picking her up at the door
Cashing that check at the store
And we were gone
'Cause it put gas in the tank
Put a little smoke in that tray
Put a little feel good in our crazy
Put a little 5th on ice
Put a little look in her eye
Sure bought a lot of time with my baby
Got us out on the edge of town
She'd light me up, I'd lay her down
Those nights got hotter
Spending those blue collar dollars
Those blue collar dollars
Little sweat on my shirt
Little sun on my burn
Little hard in that work
But it was all worth it
'Cause it put gas in the tank
Put a little smoke in that tray
Put a little feel good in our crazy
Put a little 5th on ice
Put a little look in her eye
Sure bought a lot of time with my baby
Got us out on the edge of town
She'd light me up, I'd lay her down
Those nights got hotter
Spending those blue collar dollars
Those blue collar dollars
Those blue collar dollarsI'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be
I got heartaches in my pocket
I got echoes in my head
And all that I keep hearing
Are the cruel cruel things that you said
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be
Oh, I
Oh, I
Oh, I
Oh, I
Oh, I
Oh, I
I got bruises on my memory
I got tear stains on my hands
And in the mirror there's a vision
Of what used to be a man
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be
Oh I'm
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
I'm a thousand, I'm a thousand, I'm a thousandThe lynch mob gathered in the square across from the jail
Young Billy watched them from his cell and felt his courage fail
Bill swore he wasn't guilty but the evidence was plain
Tomorrow he would go on trial for killing Mary Jane
They shouted, feed the prisoner hardy, we're gonna have a lynchin' party
Gonna hang him high, watch him die for killing Mary Jane
The mob is closer to the jail excitement all around
The deputies kept moving back, afraid to hold their ground
Then the young girl cried, you cowards
But the lynch mob surged ahead
Dragged young Billy from that jail and soon the kid was dead
They shouted, feed the prisoner hardy, we're gonna have
a lynchin'party
The weeks went by and no one spoke about it anymore
Or seemed to see the wreath, Billy's mother hung upon the door
Then one night they dragged a ragged hobo from a train
And he confessed he was the one who killed young Mary Jane
They shouted, beat the prisoner hardy
Gonna hang him high, watch him die for killing Mary JaneBaby, when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside, there was somethin' going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got somethin' goin' on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel
Needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah-ah
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothin' if you got no one
And you did walk in tonight
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one, in love forever
We can ride it together, ah-ah
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah
Sail away
Oh, come sail away with me
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ahStanding room only
You must think my bed's a bus stop
By the way you come and go
I ain't seen you with the lights on
Two nights in a row
So pack your rusty razor
And don't bother with goodbye
Your cup runneth open
But mine is always dry
[Chorus]
Standing room only
But I can't stand no more
Standing room only
Outside my door
Don't help me set the table
Cause now there's one less place
I won't lay mama's silver
For a man who won't say grace
If home is where the heart is
Then your home's on the street
Me, I'll read a good book
Turn out the lights and go to sleep
[Chorus: x2]I was hoping it wouldn't rain, no not today
There's so many things that I gotta do
There's eight hundred miles to go on this old highway
Each turn I take brings me back to you
I can't forget
You're like a song stuck in my head
Going 'round and 'round again
No I can't shut it off, I can't make it stop
I remember the last word you said
You're like a song stuck in my head
You said I'll always love you, like you love me
You kissed me and whispered goodbye
Your eyes filled with tears as I turned to leave
That picture still burning in my mind
I can't forget
You're like a song stuck in my head
Going 'round and 'round again
And oh I can't shut it off, I can't make it stop
I remember the last word you said
You're like a song stuck in my head
I don't know where tomorrow is gonna take me
Maybe run away again or maybe run back to you
You're like a song stuck in my head
Going 'round and 'round again
No I can't shut it off, I can't make it stop
I remember the last word you said
You're like a song stuck in my head
Stuck in my headcome all you fair and tender ladies
take warning how you court your men
there like a star on a summer morning
they first appear and then there gone
they'll tell to you some loving story
then they make you think that they love you well
then away they'll go to court some other
and leave you there in grief to dwell
(mandolin break)
i wish i was on some tall mountain
where the ivy rocks are black as ink
i'd write a letter to my false true lover
whose cheeks are like the morning dew
(dorbo and fiddle solo)
oh love is handsome love is charming
and love is pretty while it's new
but love grows cold as love grows old
and fades away like morning dew
(repeat chours)Sitting in a square room
My voice is freezing
And the beams that are bouncing off the moon
Are hanging from my window like icicles
Just a tired old alcoholic, waxing bucolic
Shivering and homesick
Staring at a wooden floor
Staring at a wooden floor
Last night I nearly killed myself
Chasing rum with rum
There were crows flying all around my head
And I sure caught and ate me some
It's funny how I alienated
Those who I was trying just so
So hard to impress
Now half those fuckers hate me
And I'm just a fool to all the restDesigner names and diamond rings, are just some of the finer things
I thought it took to keep her satisfied
But a bank account and credit cards, a circle drive through an acre yard
Couldn't feel that lonesome feeling, that she had inside
I bought her fancy clothes, for all occasions
And that new car so she could go just any ole where she pleased
I bought the golden band she wore, on the hand that closed the door
And I bought the shoes that just walked out on me
Leaving early and stayin out late, I thought for sure her love would wait
Until the day that I could find the time
But all the things that she expected, were all the things that I neglected
What she wanted from me would not have cost a dime
I bought her fancy clothes, for all occasions
And that new car so she could go just any ole where she pleased
I bought the golden band she wore, on the hand that closed the door
And I bought the shoes that just walked out on me(Tell me the story of Jesus sweetest that ever was heard)
Tell me the story of Jesus write on my heart every word
Tell me the story most precious sweetest that ever was heard
Tell how the angels in chorus sang as they welcomed his birth
Glory to Thy in the highest peace and the tidings to earth
Tell me the story of Jesus
Tell of the cross where they nailed him right in the anguish and pain
Tell of the grave where they laid him tell how he lived it again
(Tell me the story so tender clearer than ever I see
Still let me weep while you whisper love great and grand some for me)
Tell me the story of JesusGot up at dawn just to be out on the water
Weather man said hot and gettin' hotter
But he didn't say nothin' bout it rainin' like hell (Oh well)
A bad day of fishin' beats a good day of anything else
Had a big one on and man I woulda got 'im
But he took my pole straight down to the bottom
Leavin' me with nothin', but a big ol' story to tell (Aw hell)
A bad day of fishin' beats a good day of anything else
We should probably go to work, I mean everybody does
Instead of sittin' out here in the middle of nowhere workin' on a pretty good buzz
Didn't catch a damn thing, guess you could say we took a lickin'
Tonight's fish fry is gonna taste like chicken
But we did just fine, if I do say so myself
A bad day of fishin' beats a good day of anything else
We should probably go to work, I mean everybody does
Instead of sittin' out here in the middle of nowhere workin' on a pretty good buzz
Didn't catch a damn thing, guess you could say we took a lickin'
Tonight's fish fry is gonna taste like chicken
But we did just fine if I do say so myself
You know a bad day of fishin' beats a good day of anything else
You know a bad day of fishin' beats a good day of anything else
That's right.Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
'Cause no matter how far away your roam
If you long for the sunshine and a friendly gaze
For the holidays you can't beat home sweet home
I met a man who lived in Tennessee
And he was looking for
Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie
Now in Pennsylvania folks are traveling
Down to Dixie's sunny shore
The Atlantic to Pacific
Oh, the season is terrific
Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
For the holidays you can't beat home sweet homeAh-ah-ah-aaaaah
Ah-ah-ah-aaaaah
My own true love
My own true love
At last I've found you
My own true love
No lips but yours
No arms but yours
Will ever lead me
Through Heaven's door
I roamed the Earth
In search of this
I knew I'd know you
Know you by your kiss
And by your kiss
You've shown true love
I'm yours forever
My own true love
My own true loveStrange things are happening everyday
I hear the music up above my head
Though the side of my heart has left me again
I hear music up above
Secrets are written in the sky
Looks like I've lost the love I've never found
Though the sound of hope has left me again
I hear music up above
Standing in my broken heart all night long
Darkness held me like a friend when love was lost
Looking for the land that's hidden in the cross
The finders love
I know I loved you too much
Ill go alone to get through
I hear Rosetta singing in the night
Echo's of lighting shine like stars after there gone
And tonight shes my guide as a girl on the moon
With the music up aboveLife is beautiful, but beauty is a dying art
Life is wonderful, there's only so much you can wonder about
Before life drives you mad, and before nobody cares
Before life drives you mad, and before nobody cares
There are only words, and words mean nothing at all
There's not a single word, to speak for my rambling around
But I was searching for something, a sleepless night, painless and drugged
Oh I was searching for something, a sleepless night, painless and drugged
Time means nothing at all, it's a mark of the living to die
Space is gonna fall, and the Sun's meant to stare us straight in the eye
So maybe you will feel fire, maybe some day your love is wild
Maybe you will feel fire, maybe some day your love is wild
Heaven is an endless pit, I can fall forever but I'd never make it
Hell is all that you know, cause you've been hurt and you've walked on coals
And you crush under every command, hell on Earth is what life's always been
Yeh, you crush under every command, hell on Earth is what life's always beenYou see I'm always talkin'
When I should be drivin'
But everybody does it these days
You say I'm gettin' cancer
Every time I answer
Yeah, whatever you say
Wish I could change my service
Should have never signed up
Heck it never works anyway
The signal's always breakin'
I can't hear nothin'
Hey, what did you say?
I know you can't hear me
There ain't no use in listenin'
I can't tell what you're sayin'
All I hear is hissin'
Yeah, the more that I roam
The more I gotta pay
I'm on my cell phone
What the *$@# did you say?
I ought to get a beeper
It be a whole lot cheaper
Just throw this cell phone in the lake
I'd really love to call you
But even when I get through
It's always what did you say?
Can anybody hear me?
Or am I just wastin' minutes?
I'm in 1500
750 was my limit
Hey, I gotta go
I can't hear you anyway
I'm on my cell phone
What the *$@# did you say?
Oh, the more that I roam
The more I gotta pay
I'm on my cell phone
What the *$@# did you say?Come ride the little train,
that is rolling down the tracks,
to the junction.
Forget about your cares,
it is time to relax,
at the junction.
Lotsa curves, you bet.
Even more, when you get,
to the junction.
Petticoat Junction.
There's a little hotel,
called the Shady Rest,
at the junction.
Petticoat Junction.
It is run by Kate,
come and be her guest,
at the junction.
Petticoat Junction.
And that's Uncle Joe,
he's a movin' kind of slow,
at the junction.
Petticoat Junction.
When they hear the dinner bell,
from the Shady Rest Hotel,
at the junction.
Folks will walk a country mile,
for that chicken country-style,
at the junction,
But the dishes, to observe,
are those pretty gals, who serve,
at the junction,.

Well it's good to have ol' Bob back
For a while we though he'd found his mind
But all he found was heartache outside these walls
From friendly consolation to total humiliation
He ain't fit for the real world, no not at all
Bill tired to escape us
His new wife thought he'd walk the line
But she walked in to find him here almost every time
She had him committed
But this jury is acquitted
Any wrong that might have come from doin' right
Chorus:
And we're all here, 'cause we're not all there
Some ramble aimlessly, some sit and stare
But there's one thing that we all share
We're all here, 'cause we're not all there
As for me I feel at home here
And I like the folks who care for me
'Cause they don't care if I'm half the man I used to be
It's not your normal institution
Just a run down bar in Houston
With a sign on the door that proudly reads
(Chorus)
We're all here, 'cause we're not all thereWhen you left, I never thought I'd say
I'm alright without you anyway
But just because I say the words
Don't mean I think they're true
It's just that it's the best that I can do
I don't go to places you might be
I can't take the chance that we might meet
But just because I've stayed away
Don't mean I wanted to
It's just that it's the best that I can do
Someday I'll do better, but till then
I can't let you know how hurt I've been
I wish I had you back with me
But I won't play on your sympathy
To get you in my arms once again
I admit there are others I have seen
Sometimes I need the company
But just because I'm loving them
Don't mean I'm over you
It's just that it's the best that I can doI lost my fear in your arms
I lost my tears in your car
I lost my will in your candle lit eyes
And all my love in your yard
Baby would you leave me if you knew that I was making it up?
And underneath the love you got to wonder am I giving you up?
No way am I, it goes on.
Violent is the motion in my heart
And in my body and mind.
And silent is the feeling
That I lost but I'm determined to find.
And love is but an ocean,
Unrealistic notion,
But I cling to her devotion,
And I let it pull me down to the floor.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
I found my will in your car
I caught my tears in your arms
I found myself on that poor county drive
And found my love in your guard
Oh, Baby would you leave me if you knew
That I was making it up?
And underneath the love
You got to wonder am I giving you up?
No way am I, it goes on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on.Away beyond the blue
One star belongs to you
And every breath i take
I'm closer to that place
Yeah, baby
I'm gonna meet you there
On the outskirts of the sky
Yeah, baby
I'm gonna meet you there
And we will fly
Away beyond the blue
One star belongs to you
This life is but a dream
Go gently down the stream...
Is nind se, prabhu, kya mujheuthaoge?
(from this steep, lord will you wake me?
Is swapan se, prabhu, kya mujhe jagoge?
From this dream, lord will you wake me?
Tum hi mai dubu, turn hi mai uthu,
In thee i dive, in thee i rise,
Tere sagar me, tum hi me
In thy sea, in thee.)
Tere sagar me, tum hi meMay you always walk in sunshine slumber warm when night winds blow
May you always live with laughter for a smile becomes you so
May good fortune find your doorway may the bluebirds sing your song
May no trouble travel your way may no worry stay too long
May your heartaches be forgotten may all tears be spilled
May old acquaintance be remembered when your cup of time is filled
And may you always be a dreamer may your wildest dream come true
May you find someone to love as much as I love you
(Should old acquaintance be remembered)Chorus:
Bury me along the big sandy
Down in the blue gray mountains
Rest my soul in those hills of coal
Until this old earth does tremble
Now don't you mourn for me when my soul is free
Woman don't you cry
Just bury me along the big sandy
Under a blue Kentucky sky
This old town of sin, it's about to do me in
I don't know how much I can stand
With my knees on the street and my heart at their feet
I'm forced to beg from Satan's hand
Chorus:
So bury me along the big sandy
Down in the blue gray mountains
Rest my soul in those hills of coal
Until this old earth does tremble
Now don't you mourn for me when my soul is free
Woman don't you cry
Just bury me along the big sandy
Under a blue Kentucky sky
When I came to this land I was strong and I could stand
But now I've somehow gone astray
Yet I still see the truth in the teachings of my youth
And I know that the Lord ain't turned away
Chorus:
So Bury me along the big sandy
Down in the blue gray mountains
Rest my soul in those hills of coal
Until this old earth does tremble
Now don't you mourn for me when my soul is free
Woman don't you cry
Just bury me along the big sandy
Under a blue Kentucky sky
Under a blue Kentucky skyYour cheatin' heart will make you weep
You'll try and try and try to sleep
But sleep won't come the whole night through
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
When tears come down like falling rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You're gonna walk the floor the way I do
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
When tears come down like falling rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You're gonna walk the floor the way I do
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
Your cheatin' heart will tell on youOh you must pray every day pray every day pray to God up above
You've got to go all the way get down on your knees and pray show him all your love
When your life is lonely and everything is wrong and you don't know what to do
Just get down on your knees and look up to heaven and say a prayer or two
Oh you must pray every day
If old Satan comes a knockin' on your door don't let him in he's got his eye on you
Don't be tempted my friend cause all he is a sin and he'll only bring sorrow to you
Oh you must pray every day.I'm used to being alone.
Except for six month flings with diamond rings and phone bills that outweigh the phone...
This is the life that I choose.
I got no complaints if he is;
if he ain't, I guess he'll send me a rose.
Just don't ask me for the truth if you choose to lie honey.
And don't try to open my door with your skeleton key.
Some folks seem to think I only got one problem.
I can't find nobody as crazy as me.
I still love what I know.
I love to ride alone and sing a song and listen to the radio.
You can ride alone and if you change your mind, well, that's just fine, but there is somethin' that you got to know:
Just don't ask me for the for the truth if you choose to lie honey.
And don't try to open my door with your skeleton key.
Some folks seem to think I only got one problem.
I can't find nobody as crazy as me.Before the ice was broken
I thought it was only me
Before the words were spoken
We crept into other dreams
Now our shadows whisper
We're getting closer
We know we're falling
We can go on forever
We can go on forever
We can go on 'til we hit the ground
Don't try to understand it
The pleasure is worth the fear
They'll watch us launch our rockets
We'll grow wings and disappear
Cause our shadows whisper
We're getting closer
We know we're falling
We can go on forever
We can go on forever
We can go on 'til we hit the ground
We can go on forever
We can go on forever
We can go on 'til we hit the groundI want to tell you a story every girl oughta know
If you want a little loving you gotta start real slow
He's gonna love you tonight if you just treat him right
Hmm squeeze a real gentle you gotta make him feel good
Tell him that you love him like you know you should
Cause if you don't treat him right he won't love you tonight
Hey hey hey hey
[ Fiddle ]
If you practise my maintenance just as hard as you can
You gonna get the reputation that you can love your man
And you'll be glad every night that you treated him right
Hey hey hey hey
[ Guitar ]
I want to tell you a story...
He's gonna love you tonight if you just treat him right
And you'll be glad every night that you treated him right
And you'll be glad every night that you treated him rightIt's midnight Cinderella
But don't you worry none
'Cause I'm Peter, Peter the Pumpkin Eater
And the party has just begun
I guess you're prince charming
Wasn't after all
'Cause he sure seemed different right after the ball
I guess that more than horses
Are turnin' into rats
And by the way he's walkin'
I can guess where your slippers at
It's midnight Cinderella
Time that you should know
There's gonna be some changes in the way this story goes
It's midnight Cinderella
But don't you worry none
'Cause I'm Peter, Peter the pumpkin eater
And the party has just begun
I'm gonna help you get over
Bein' under that spell
You're gonna learn to love midnight
Inside this pumpkin shell
I gotta few new magic tricks
Your Godmother can't do
And I'll show you want it means to bip, bip, bip, bip, boppity, boo hooHalf of this morning and most of last night
I've been taking tally on the last years of my life
I've been pretty righteous but God only knows
A couple of calls were not even close
At least my indiscretions were sweeter than most
Oh, those loving arms, those sweet, sweet loving arms
Count the bad, count the good
And all I wouldn't change even if I could
I used to stumble back when I was young
And I'm still stumbling but now it's a lot more fun
And I'm falling, I'm falling, I flew too close to the sun
To get your loving arms, your loving arms, your loving arms
Your sweet, sweet loving arms
To get to your loving arms, your loving arms, your loving arms
Your sweet, sweet loving arms
Empty pockets, motel beds
Airline tickets, words better left unsaid
Strange kisses get the ghost
What I miss is what she'll never know
Everyday another mountain, another mountain to climb
To get to your loving arms, your loving arms, your loving arms
Your sweet, sweet loving arms
To get to your loving arms, your loving arms, your loving arms
Your sweet, sweet loving arms
And the world could be perfect even if we are not
If everything is forgiven even if not forgot
And when the morning comes a breaking
And I call out your name, my heart will be running
Oh, running to get to your loving arms, your loving arms, your loving arms
Your sweet, sweet loving arms
To get to your loving arms, your loving arms, your loving arms
Your sweet, sweet loving arms
To get to your loving arms, your loving arms, your loving arms
Your sweet, sweet loving arms
Your loving arms, your loving arms, your loving arms
Your sweet, sweet loving arms
To get to your loving armsI'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
Oh, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases
All your Christmases
May all your Christmases be whiteOh, the power and the blow of that first kiss
I swear, it almost knocked me to my knees
I wasn't ready, caught my heart off guard
For the first time in my life I felt week
And I could not stop myself from lovin' you
It's a feelin' if I fought, I know I'd lose
I could never let it go, I could never walk away
If I did, it would tear me in two
Even if I tried, I could not stop myself from lovin' you
It was over, oh, I never had a chance
I fell and I was never comin' back
I surrendered, your love was just too strong
I knew that I had finally met my match
And I could not stop myself from lovin' you
It's a feelin' if I fought, I know I'd lose
I could never let it go, I could never walk away
If I did, it would tear me in two
Even if I tried, I could not stop myself from lovin' youAnswer me oh my love just what sin have I been guilty of
Tell me how I came to lose your love please answer me my love
You were mine yesterday I believed that love was here to stay
Won't you tell me where I've gone astray please answer me my love
If you're happier without me I'll try not to care
But if you still think about me please listen to my prayer
You must know I've been true won't you say that we can start anew
In my sorrow now I turn to you please answer me my love
[ guitar ]
You must know I've been true...Thanks, thanks a lot
I got a broken heart that's all I got
You made me cry and I cried a lot
I lost your love baby thanks a lot
You told our friends as I was passing by
That you're not sorry that you made me cry
You said I deserved just what I got
Well if that's how you feel baby thanks a lot
Thanks, thanks a lot
I got a broken heart that's all I got
You made me cry and I cried a lot
I lost your love baby thanks a lot
You wanted a fool and I played the part
Now all I've got is a broken heart
We loved a little and laughed a lot
Then you were gone
Honey thanks a lot
Thanks, thanks a lot
I got a broken heart that's all I got
You made me cry and I cried a lot
I lost your love baby thanks a lotIf you got it on nine, you got it too low
Crank that ten 'til the Kenwoods blow
Two in the morning ain't late enough
We gon' be here 'til the sun shows up
You had one shot, baby take one more
If you had two, make it three, maybe four
Feeling like you're ten feet off the floor
You know what you came here for
Whatever you got to raise up
You can't get it high enough
Your hands or your phone or your cup
Set it off like the 4th Of July
And take it up to the sky
We'll be flying up in the clouds
Like we're never gonna come back down
Like we're running out of runway lights
Gonna take it up to the sky
We're gonna touch the stars,
Baby no it ain't that far
If you sitting down, get up on your feet
If you're standing up, get up on your seat
If you on your seat, find a girl who don't know you
Spin a little game, get her up on your shoulders
If she wants to dance, give her what you got
Turn a cool night into sunburn hot
If she starts getting that look her in her eye
Take her to the moon at night
Whatever you got to raise up
You can't get it high enough
Your hands or your phone or your cup
Set it off like the 4th Of July
Take it up to the sky
We'll be flying up in the clouds
Like we're never gonna come back down
Like we're running out of runway lights
Gonna take it up to the sky
We're goin' up to the sky, we're goin' up to the sky
We're goin' up to the sky, we're so high, oh yeah
Whatever you got to raise up
Whatever you got to raise up
You can't get it high enough
Your hands or your phone or your cup
Set it off like the 4th Of July
Go on and take it up to the sky
We'll be flying up in the clouds
Like we're never gonna come back down
Like we're running out of runway lights
Gonna take it up to the sky
We're gonna touch the stars
Baby, no it ain't that far, come on
Go on and take it up to the sky
We'll be flying up in the clouds
Like we're never gonna come back down
Like we're running out of runway lights
Take it up to the skyWell it's hard to find a night horse
That one sure-footed right horse
To ride a cowboy safely through the dark
The finest one I ever rode
Was a short-leg bay named Little Joe
When I signed on with this outfit in South Park
Well the night was still and the moon went down
Through the herd there was not a sound
That's the time an old hand knows a cow might run
Sure enough they jumped and ran
Went crashin' through the smooth strand
And twenty buckaroos knew what was to come
[Chorus:]
They're runnin' boys, they're runnin'
You all go run along
Don't try to turn 'em back 'til they tire
Just let 'em run their course
Turn it over to your night horse
Let him bring you back on home to the fire
Well a lot of things that night happened
That later got us laughin'
'Though in the moment we were all strung out pretty tight
Joe Petty thought a clump of chimeeza
Was a bedded down herd of cows
So he circled around 'em singin' 'til daylight
Then his night horse stolen by the cook
Old Bill Jim got set afoot
Cussin' out that cook as they rode away
But they didn't go far and they had a bad wreck
Bill's horse died of a broken neck
And the cook stumbled through the night in a daze
[Chorus]
Well it's gopher holes and steep ravines
That in the night cannot be seen
So he must use somethin' other than his eyes
Whatever birds fly south on
I guess that's what he counts on
Little Joe could carry me through to sunrise
[Chorus]
Just let 'em run their course
Turn it over to your night horse
Let him bring you back on home to the fireThere's a well beaten path in the old mountainside
Where I wandered when I was a lad
And I wandered alone to the place I call home
In those Blueridge hills far away
Oh I love those hills of old Virginia
From those Blueridge hills I did roam
When I die won't you bury me on the mountain
Far away near my Blueridge mountain home
Now my thoughts wander back to that ramshackle shack
In those blue ridge hills far away
Where my mother and dad were laid there to rest
They are sleeping in peace together there
I return to that old cabin home with the sigh
I've been longing for days gone by
When I die won't you bury me on that old mountain side
Make my resting place upon the hills so high(Take these chains from my heart and set me free)
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
You've grown cold and no longer care for me
All my faith in you is gone but the heartaches linger on
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take these tears from my eyes and let me see
Just a spark of the love that used to be
If you love somebody new let me find a new love too
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Give my heart just a word of sympathy be as fair to my heart as you can be
Then if you no longer care for the love that's beating there
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
(Take these chains from my heart and set me free set me free)(Uh huh there is always me)
When the evening shadows fall and your wondering who to call
For a little company there's always me
Or if your great romance should end and you're lonesome for a friend
Darling you need never be there's always me
I don't seem to mind somehow playing second fiddle now
Someday you'll want me dear and when that day is here
Within my arms you'll come to know other loves may come and go
But my love for you will be eternally
Look around and you will see there's always meSteel rails, chasing sunshine round the bend
Winding through the trees, like a ribbon in the wind
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track
Cause I'm looking out ahead, to keep my mind from turning back
It's not the first time I've found myself alone and known
If I really had you once, then I'd have you when I'm gone
Whistle blows, blowin' lonesome in my mind
Calling me along that never ending metal line
Steel rails, chasing sunshine round the bend
Winding through the trees, like a ribbon in the wind
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track
Cause I'm looking out ahead, to keep my mind from turning back
Sun is shining, through the open boxcar door
Lying in my mind with the things I've known before
I've lost count of the hours, days, and nights
The rhythm of the rails keeps the motion in my mind
Steel rails, chasing sunshine round the bend
Winding through the trees, like a ribbon in the wind
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track
Cause I'm looking out ahead, to keep my mind from turning back
Cause I'm looking out ahead, to keep my mind from turning backI know she's a long way from an angel and of man's a fool to love her kind
And I also know one of these days she'll go back to her cheatin' ways
But my heart just won't listen to my mind
No my heart just won't listen if I woke up and found her missin'
I guess I'd come very close to dyin'
I know I'm making a bad mistake headin' straight for a big heartache
But my heart just won't listen to my mind
She's tryin' God knows by baby's tryin' but she's getting more restless all the time
So I'm gonna live from day to day let the chips fall where they may
For my heart just won't listen to my mind
No my heart just won't listenWe'll sing in the sunshine we'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine then I'll be on my way
I will never love you the cost of love's too dear
But though I'll never love you I'll stay with you one year
And we'll sing in the sunshine...
I'll sing to you each morning I'll kiss you every night
But darling don't cling to me I'll soon be out of sight
But we'll sing in the sunshine...
My daddy he once told me don't you love you any woman
Just take what they may give you and give but what you can
And we'll sing in the sunshine...
And when our year has ended and I have gone away
You'll often speak about me and this is what you'll say
We sang in the sunshine we laughed every day
We sang in the sunshine and I went on my wayLord, I hope this day is good
I'm feelin' empty and misunderstood
I should be thankful Lord, I know I should
But Lord, I hope this day is good
Lord, have you forgotten me
I've been prayin' to you faithfully
I'm not sayin' I'm a righteous man
But Lord, I hope you understand
I don't need fortune and I don't need fame
Send down the thunder Lord, send down the rain
But when you're planning just how it will be
Plan a good day for me
You've been the king since the dawn of time
All that I'm asking is a little less crime
It might be hard for the devil to do
But it would be easy for youI'm gonna live my life
Like every day's the last
Without a simple goodbye
It all goes by so fast
And now that you're gone
I can't cry hard enough
I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now
I'm gonna open my eyes
And see for the first time
I've let go of you
Like a child letting go of his kite
Oh, there it goes up in the sky
There it goes beyond the clouds
For no reason why
I can't cry hard enough
No, I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now
Gonna look back in vain
And see you standing there
When all that remains
Is just the empty air
And now that you're gone
I can't cry hard enough
No, I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now
There it goes, up in the sky
There it goes, beyond the clouds
For no reason why
I can't cry hard enough
No, I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now
I'm gonna live my life
Like every day's the last
I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me nowOh great mountain
You won't be moving any time soon
Over the blue, shimmering water
It's the same moon
Down on the eastern shore,
So like home you feel you've been before
Never left wanting more
So lovely and familiar
I love it that way,
Constant sea I pray
My heart's on the old highway
Oh, my heart's on the old highway
Prairies open wide
Brilliant stars and biggest skies
It's always there with sweet surprise
I soak up the night
The more you see
The more you know
Days move slow
But the loneliness will leave you
I love it that way
Far as I can see any time of day
My heart's on the old highway
Oh, my heart's on the old highway
The moon is high, the tides are low
Seas roll and winds blow
People come and people go
But the loneliness will leave you
The loneliness will leave you
Oooh oooh
oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
I miss home,
I miss my momma
I miss the babies too
When I'm on the road,
I'm out singing,
Singing the play for you
The more you see
The more you know
Days move slow
But the loneliness will leave you
The more you see
The more you know
Days move slow
But the loneliness will leave you
I love you that way
Home and family I crave
My heart's on the old highway
Oh, my heart's on the old highway
My heart's on the old highway
Oh, my heart's on the old highwayThey're not teardrops just sincere drops
They're I love you drops cause I love you (I love you)
They were on my pillow when I woke up this morning
They were on the letter I tried all day to write
And just a little while ago I saw them falling on your picture as I kissed it goodnight
I love you drops I miss you drops hurry home drops you've been gone so long drops
They're not teardrops just sincere drops
That say I'm lonesome and I love you (I love you)
Never knew this heart could hurt the way it hurts for you
Never lived so many lifetimes in a week
Why don't you come back to me the way you said you would
And kiss these little crystals off my cheekAin't the snow fallin' just a bit deeper these days
Ain't they're building the stairs a bit steeper these days
And the town's really changin' in so many ways it's time time
The young folks you're growin' uncommonly tall
And the newspaper print is becomin' so small
And folks talk so soft you can barely hear at all it's time just time
Jokes aren't as witty as the old jokes once were
And the girls ain't half as pretty as I remember her
And today on the bus a grown man called me sir it's time just time
You know I ain't quite as anxious for fame or success
And my eye finds the girl in the plain simple dress
And I cling a bit longer to each warm caress that's time just time
So it takes a bit longer to walk up a hill
What of it but my life now is much more fulfill
But they're tearin' down the buildings that I watched them build it's time timeYOU BELONG TO ME
Writers Pee Wee King, Chilton Price, Redd Stewart
See the pyramids along the Nile Watch the sun rise on a tropic isle Just remember, darling, all the while You belong to me. See the marketplace in old Algiers Send me photographs and souvenirs But remember when a dream appears You belong to me. I'll be so alone without you Maybe you'll be lonesome too---and blue Fly the ocean in a silver plane Watch the jungle when it's wet with rain Just remember till you're home again You belong to meI'll be home for Christmas you can count on me
Fileds have snow and mistletoe and presents under the tree
Christmas Eve will find me where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas if only in my dreams
Christmas Eve will find me...
If only in my dreams
Yes I'll be home I'll be home for ChristmasI love you because you understand dear
Every single thing I try to do
You're always there to lend a halping hand dear
Most of all I love you cause you're you
No matter what the world may say about me
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you cause you're you
[ piano ]
I love you because my heart is lighter
Every time I'm walking by your side
I love you because the future's brighter
The door to heaven dear is opened wide
No matter what may be the style or season
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
But most of all I love you cause you're youI never had much luck with romance
Anytime it ever got near me
Love seemed to slip through my hands
Took me low as a girl could be
So if I act a little gun shy
Don't think it's 'cause I don't want you
I know you'll understand just why
When I tell you what my heart's been through
It's been bulldozed
Deep froze heaven knows
It's a true connoisseur of pain
It's been lost, double crossed
Rolled up and hand tossed
Left out in the pourin' rain
It's been beat down, kicked around
Stomped into the hard ground
Slammed like a finger in the door
But honey, you're the break
My heart's been waitin' for
You're like a breath of fresh air
Dry land to a ship at sea
Boy, I'm sendin' up my last flare
I think you're gonna rescue me
Baby, I'm countin' on your touch
To get us back on the mend
My heart's gotten hurt so much
It sure could use a friend
'Cause it's been bulldozed
Deep froze heaven knows
It's a true connoisseur of pain
It's been lost, double crossed
Rolled up and hand tossed
Left out in the pourin' rain
It's been beat down, kicked around
Stomped into the hard ground
Slammed like a finger in the door
But honey, you're the break
My heart's been waitin' for
It's been beat down, kicked around
Stomped into the hard ground
Slammed like a finger in the door
But honey, you're the break
My heart's been waitin' for, yeahI'm a gonna leave here monday morning
Oh, I'm a gonna leave here monday morning
Oh, I'm a gonna leave here monday morning
Oh, I never expect to see you anymore
My home's across this blue ridge mountains
My home's across the blue ridge mountains
My home's across the blue ridge mountains
Oh, I never expect to see you anymore
(Break)
How can I keep from crying?
How can I keep from crying?
How can I keep from crying?
While I never expect to see you anymore
(Break)
Rockin' feet my baby candy
Rockin' feet my baby candy
Rockin' feet my baby candy
Oh, I never expect to see you anymore
(Chorus)
(Break)
How can I keep from crying?
How can I keep from crying?
How can I keep from crying?
When I never expect to see you anymore
(Chorus)You make me promises that you don't keep
Tears are expensive, honey, words are cheap
You tell me one thing then do something else
And even though I know that all too well
I keep forgiving
I keep forgetting
I keep expecting you to change
You say you will
You say you will
You say you will
But you never do
Love doesn't come with any guarantee
It's give and take a little, that's the key
So I give you every little thing you choose
An you give me back a stack of I.O.U.'s
There seems to be a pattern here
How can I tell if you're sincere
You say you will
You say you will
You say you will
But you never do
You say you will
You say you will
You say you will
But you never doMonday's promise is Tuesday's lie
Saturday's party is Sunday's fight
Somethin's wrong with you and I
Love's gone wrong that used to be right
And I can feel it slippin' away
Slowly, slowly slippin' away
It'll be gone in a few more days
If we don't stop this love of ours
From slippin' away
Wednesday's kisses are Thursday's frowns
We can't live two days in a row
When our world's not upside down
Here we stand watchin' it go
And I can feel it slippin' away
Slowly, slowly slippin' away
It'll be gone in a few more days
If we don't stop this love of ours
From slippin' away
Roses are red, violets are blue
Sugar is sweet some of the time
This puzzle's missin' a piece or two
We've got the grapes but never the wine
And I can feel it slippin' away
Slowly, slowly slippin' away
It'll be gone in a few more days
If we don't stop this love of ours
From slippin' away
And I can feel it slippin' away
Slowly, slowly slippin' away
It'll be gone in a few more days
If we don't stop this love of ours
From slippin' away
And I can feel it slippin' away
Slowly, slowly slippin' away
It'll be gone in a few more days
If we don't stop this love of ours
From slippin' awayHe's just leadin' you on honey he'll be gone
Before the ring on your finger turns green
Your new love is the playboy kind he's not looking for the ties that bind
He'll leave you with a tortured mind before the ring on your finger turns green
He's just leadin' you...
He's fickle cheap and phoney too just like the ring he gave to you
I know cause I've been through it too when the ring on my finger turned green
He's just leadin' you...
Before the ring on your finger turns greenAlways friend
Always friend
Still some fences
We may never mend
In our time
Broken hearts
Broken lines
Every now and then
Ya spring ta mind
And we are
Always friends
Always friends
Always and forever
Thick or thin
Push it away before I let you in
And make the same mistakes twice
Dim the lights
Such is hell
Hey and such is life
And we are always friends
Always friends
Always friends
Broken hearts
Broken lines
Pray there never comes a second time
Because it?s such a court
Such a crime
Find the strength to leave the past behind
And we are always friends
Always friends
Always friends
Always
Push it away before I let you in
Commit the same wrongs twice
Such is hell
Hey and such is life
And we are always friendsThey say a man's home is his castle
He's like a king on a throne
It may be a shack down alongside the track
But everything in it's his own
So don't think of taking his loved one
It's written Thou shall not steal
Don't rob another man's castle
No matter how lonesome you feel
Don't rob another man's castle
Don't take his treasures away
Strange as it seems when you steal a man's dreams
You'll never know then how you'll pay
So don't rob a man of his loved one
You'll break his heart don't you see
I robbed another man's castle
Now someone just stole her from meTrains and boats and planes
Are passing by,
Could mean a trip
To Paris or Rome
For someone else
But not for me
The trains and boats and planes
Took you away, away from me.
We were so in love,
And high above
We had a star
To wish upon, wish
And dreams do come true,
But not for me
The trains and boats and planes
Took you away, away from me.
Trains and boats and planes
Took you away,
But every time I see them I pray
And if my prayers
Can cross the sea,
The trains and boats and planes
Will bring you back,
Back home to me...We've had some good we've had some bad but mostly in-between
Used words like love words like hate and words we didn't mean
We've put it down we've patched it up we both have had our say
Divorce ain't black divorce ain't white just a sad ole shade of gray
Neither one of us was always right neither one was always strong
We never put I love you in the place where it belonged
When one was up the other was down and love can't grow that way
Divorce ain't black divorce ain't white just a sad ole shade of gray
You'll find a love to take my place and I'll find me someone
For when it's all been said and done more was said than done
So you take yours and I'll take mine
We'll go our seperate ways
Divorce ain't black divorce ain't white just a sad ole shade of gray
Divorce ain't black divorce ain't white just a sad ole shade of grayIf you were mine Mary know what I'd do
I'd take the stars Mary and give them to you
If you were mine Mary know what I'd say
I'd say that I love Mary over again
All through the day
So if you love me please don't pretend
For there's a lifetime of happiness waiting round the bend
If you were mine Mary know what I'd do
I'd take my heart Mary and with all my love I'd give it to you
I'd take my heart Mary and with all my love I'd give it to youI heard you drink
I heard you had a crazy side under your skin,
but you cover up under there and scared of what I think
But tell me why that matters though as long as you stay honest girl
I heard you had
I heard you had a crazy ex that made you bad, they scared to go and trust again
so love is not the plan
tell my why he mad as fuh as long as you stay honest girl
I want the good and bad in you, everything that you are
I want every single side, everything part of you
without the good and bad in you, you wouldn't be the same
so take the time that you need, you'll be worth the wait
ay ay, ay ay, you'll be worth the wait,From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
From the green old flowing mountains to the south down along the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome, she's known quite well by all
The regular combination on that Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine, hear the lonesome hobo's call
As you ramble across the country on that Wabash Cannonball
Well, the eastern states are dandy, most people always say
From New York to St. Louis and old Chicago by the way
To the hills of Minnesota where them rippling waters fall
No changes need be taken on that Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine, hear the lonesome hobo's call
As you ramble across the country on that Wabash Cannonball
Here's to Daddy Claxton, may his name forever stand
In the hills of Tennessee many places throughout the land
When his earthly race are over and them curtains 'round him fall
[Incomprehensible] him back to Dixie on that Wabash Cannonball
We came down to Nashville on a warm November day
As we rolled into that station I heard somebody say
There's a boy from Carolina, they're wide and fat and tall
They came down to pick us a few, they rode the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to that jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine, hear the lonesome hobo's call
As you ramble across the country on that Wabash CannonballLove is a burnin` thing
And it makes a firy ring
Bound by love`s desire
I fell into the ring of fire
[Chorus]
I fell into your burnin` ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
Taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Ooh, but the fire went wild
[Chorus]
[Chorus]
Love is a burnin` thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into the ring of fire
[Chorus]
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fireHeartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you come back again
You came back and never meant to stay
[Chorus]
Now I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Everyday you love me less, each day I love you more
Yes I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting, that's the day my world will end
Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited but you must have lost your way
[Chorus]By David Allan Coe
Every night another woman
Every day a different town
If I'm not accused of speeding
I'm accused of coming down
With a legal dose of something
That you heard was going 'round
And you wondered why I lost my sense of humor
Every song another record
Every day just like a clock
Knowing well I've had to take it
Till I make it to the top
With the devil right behind me
And my heart about to stop
Then you wondered why I lost my sense of humor
Twenty years I was in prison
More than that I was alone
Some lily-white reporter
Thinks it's time that I was stoned
Without sin, he wrote the story
And it chilled me to the bone
Then he wondered why I lost my sense of humor
I shaved my beard and cut my hair off
It don't matter anyhow
It was truth that told the answers
To the questions up till now
"Crucify him," someone shouted
From the safety of the crowd
Then they wondered why I lost my sense of humor
Hey, take them crosses from my doorstep
There's no reason to my rhyme
Everybody knows somebody
Will take care of me in time
I made friends of all you stand for
But the blind can't lead the blind
Just be glad I haven't lost my sense of humor
Just be glad I haven't lost my sense of humor
'Cause if I ever catch you I'm gonna kick your assThese dance hall girls, they don't treat you kind
They give you their bodies but you never reach their minds
Well, they fill you up with lipstick lies
When they put you down some, don't ya be surprised
Is this the way it always is, here in Baltimore?
Well, I saw her mountains and I kissed her plains
I held her sunshine and I drank her rains
Well, I went so far that I broke too fast
Thought I had me a winner picked but I came in last again
Is this the way it always is, here in Baltimore?
I must have chosen the wrong season to come down
I never realized they called this sacred ground
My sense of time, hell, I'm a week behind
I sent me a letter home but this all takes time
Gonna get some cash, gonna go back home
These dance hall girls really know how to make a man feel alone
Is this the way it always is, here in Baltimore?
My sense of time, hell, I'm a week behind
I sent me a letter home but this all takes time
Gonna get some cash, gonna blow this town
These dance hall girls really know how to drag a poor boy down
Is this the way it always is, here in Baltimore?
Is this the way it always is, here in Baltimore?If I said you have a beautiful Body
would you hold it against me?
If I swore you were an angel
would you treat me like the devil tonight?
If I was dying of thirst
would your flowing love come quench me?
If I said
you have a beautiful Body
would you hold it against me?
Now
we could talk all night about the weather
could tell you about my friends out on the coast.
I could ask a lot of crazy questions
or ask you what I really want to know.
If I said ...
Now
rain can fall so soft against the window;
The sun can shine so bright up in the sky.
But daddy always told me
don't make small talk;
He said: "Come on out and say what's on your mind".
So if I said ...
If I said ...
If I said
you have a beautiful body
would you hold it against me?Girl don't look at me that way for the things I must do
For it's not that I love you less there's just nothing left to do
But understand my reasons that I ask to be set free
They're small ones but they mean the world to me
Little reasons that say daddy I love you bring me a prize
Little faces that light up each night when I pull in the drive
I wouldn't have you hurt girl and you know love's flame hasn't dimmed
But I can't take the chance of losing them
She doesn't know about us but I've got to do what's right
For it's my fault not hers that loves sweet dawn has turned to night
It was good between us once so it's up to me to try
And hope little reasons can save old love's life
Little reasons that sayIf there's someone out there their heart is filled with doubt
If they standing in the shadow and the candles blows out
And the devil is there with you, he's got you in his hold
You think you're no match for him but don't surrender your soul
When the devil wants to wrestle put Jesus in the ring
When you're down for the count just call out His name
If he's got you in his grip, oh, remember this one thing
When the devil wants to wrestle put Jesus in the ring
There I was, all alone fearing for my life
There was darkness all around me on that lonely night
When the devil made a move, he got a hold of me
Then I called out for help and the Lord set me free
When the devil wants to wrestle put Jesus in the ring
When you're down for the count just call out His name
If he's got you in his grip, oh, remember this one thing
When the devil wants to wrestle put Jesus in the ring
When the devil wants to wrestle put Jesus in the ringTwo men sittin' in straight back chairs
Feet propped up on the railin'
Sittin' in front of the country store
Discussin' how the crops were failin'
About that time a car drove by
With an Ace Insurance bumper sticker
Well that must be the man been courtin' Abell
He's somethin' of a city slicker
(Ah, you can tell just from the way he's drivin' that car)
Do you reckon he's goin' up to see Abell
You know her daddy went to Maben this day
And her mommas been in Arkansas with her ailin' pa
Ain't nobody home that way
(Ha ha, 'cept Abell)
Now, I don't mean nothing by what I say
But if you won't say it, I can
She ain't got no bid'ness alone
With that Ace Insurance man
(Why there's just no tellin' what might happen)
People ought to keep an eye on they're kids
You remember 'bout Abby Mcguinness
Why'it, lik'ta kill'ed her ma when she found out about it
Course I know it ain't none of my bid'ness
But uh, well, if it was me, if it was me
It might be too late and it would be a pity
Better call up the sheriff in Calhoun city
And have the preacher organize a 'vestigating committee
To see what's going on
(Yes, sir, and we'd better hurry)
Tearing down the road in a pickup truck
With Bentley out taking the lead
Followed by a tractor and a half lame mule
Dust flyin' as they picked up speed
Faces beaming goodness and their jaw's set hard
Good people just doin' what's right
And off in the distance was Abell's house
And there wasn't a soul in sight
Aw, I could'a told you
(Oh, I just knew it)
Now the gravel was flying as he turned the bend
And screeched to a grinding halt
They went through the fence, into the flower bed
And hit pa's first-prize hog in the head
And left half a dozen mama's chickens for dead
But it wasn't nobody's fault
Oh, look at Harvey's prize hog
And all of them darlin' old grown bad trusty chickens
(We got more important things to tend to, boy)
I wonder if they're covered?
Committee bounded on the front porch
To meet the enemy face to face
But Abell yelled at 'em through the screen door
"y'all messed up my daddy's place"
But in her hand she waved a policy
Sayin' with a Mona Lisa grin
"Well, y'all timed that one just about right
'Cause Ace done struck again"I'm weary and tired I've done my day's ridin'
Nighttime is rolling my way
The sky's all on fire and the light's slowly fadin'
Peaceful and still ends the day
And out on the trail, the night birds are callin'
Singin' their wild melody
Down in the canyon, the cottonwood whispers
A song of Wyoming for me
I've wandered around the town and the city
Tried to figure the how and the why
I've stopped all my schemin'
I'm just driftin' and dreamin' and watching the river roll by
And here comes that big ole prairie moon risin'
Shinin' down bright as can be
And up on the hill there's a coyote singin'
A song of Wyoming for me
Well now it's whiskey and tobacco and bitter black coffee
A lonesome old doggie am I
Waking up on the range, Lord, I feel like an angel
Free like I almost could fly
Drift like a cloud out over the badlands
Sing like a bird in the tree
The wind through the sage sounds like Heaven singin'
A song of Wyoming for me
A song of Wyoming for meWhen the numbers get so high
Of the dead flying through the sky
O, I don't know why
Love comes to me
Love comes to me
When your mouth is laying ope
Head knocked back you don't cope
You're out of rings and flowers and soap
Love comes to me
Love comes to me
Love comes to me
Love comes and all
It's my hands, my heart, my lips
And that is all
When the fever hits your forehead
Intrusive mice chew up your bed
And you call on God and God is dead
Love comes to you
Love comes to you
O, sugar won't you be my only
I'm a hard-hearted honey-pot hungry shepherd
And I'm longing to be born for you, that's her
Love comes to you
Love comes and all
It's your hands, your heart, your lip
And that is all
In the night time when you feel me
And the backs of your knees conceal me
And your eyeballs unreal me
Love comes to me
Love comes to meLonesome, crying heartaches
That's human emotions
I never knew, lord
Till she went away
Begging, pleading, forgiveness
That's human emotions
Three's nothing as lonesome
As hearing her say
She don't mean to hurt me
She just wants her freedom
Revenge ain't worth having
When it comes so slow
We hurt her too much now
For her to get even
Even if leaving
Means no place to go
She packed up her suitcase
Along with the babies
But she left her paintings
They hang on the wall
It's her way of telling me
Just what I'll be missing
Missing her's something
I hate most of allLord I ain't no stranger now
Lord I ain't no stranger now
I've been introduced to the Father and the Son
Lord I ain't no stranger now
Cryin' holy unto my Lord
Cryin holy unto my Lord
Lord if I could I surely would
Stand on that rock where Moses stood
Sinners run and hide your face
Sinners run and hide your face
Run to the rocks and hide your face
The rocks won't have no hiding placeHe was a friend of mine he was a friend of mine
He died without a penny he didn't have a dime he was a friend of mine
He died neath the midnight sun he died neath the midnight sun
His wanderin' days are over his loneliness is done
Yes he died neath the midnight sun
I have a lot of buddies in my time but he was the best buddy I ever had
The kind of friend you can lean on and turn to when times 're goin' bad
He could have been a rich man or maybe he could be the President
But he was just a friend of mine the one who had died without a cent
I soughed away and cried I soughed away and cried
Tears fell like raindrops the night my best friend died
He was a friend of mine he was a friend of mineIt was dark and I was driving down a lonely Texas road
The night was hot and sleep pulled at my eyes
I was thinking bout the wild times and the women that I'd had
The deceitful things I'd done and those lies
When standin' in the shadows at the side of the road
Stood the figure of a withered old man
He wore a black bandana a ropin' stetson hat
With a two inch scarlet hat band
He held his wrinkled hand up as a sign to shut 'er down
So I pulled over and stopped at his side
He opened up the door slid in and sat down
And said my ain't it hot tonight
I studied this old man and it seemed mighty strange
For him to be out here all alone
And then he started talking and he told me many things
Of times that both of us had known
He told me of the wild life and the women that he'd known
How none of them had ever meant a thing
He told me of a black night much the same as this
Of the strange and awesome things he'd seen
A man beside the road had raised his hand
And flagged him down so he stopped and let him in
That stranger told him stories that I am hearing now
Bout the wild times and all the sin
And the car got cold and clammy and this old man looked at me
He said boy I've come here for you
Your days of wicked sinnin' have come to an end
As a mortal on this earth you are through
Then his eyes got red and firey as he took his stetson off
To reveal his evil horns shiney and black
My God the fear came o'er and my senses were all lost
I fought with him until we finally crashed
Next day they found the car at the bottom of the draw
The young cowboy was found beside the wreck
The car had been consumed by fire
But the cowboy had no marks
Except the smokin' pitchfork brand upon his neckDo not forsake me, oh, my darling
On this our wedding day
Do not forsake me, oh, my darling
Wait, wait along
I do not know what fate awaits me
I only know I must be brave
And I must face a man who hates me
Or lie a coward, a craven coward or lie a coward in my grave
Oh, to be torn twixt love and duty
Supposin' I lose my fair haired beauty
Look at that big hand move along nearing high noon
He made a vow while in state prison
Vowed it would be my life or his
I'm not afraid at all
What will I do if you leave me
Do not forsake me, oh, my darling
You made that promise as a bride
Do not forsake me, oh, my darling
Although you're grieving, don't think of leaving
Now, that I need you by my side
Wait along, wait along, wait along, wait alongI know all about black clouds
There's one that follows me around
It may sound funny
But somehow it only rains on me
It follows me almost everywhere
And it seems it's hardly fair
People will stop and people stare
But it only rains on me
Broken dreams and drowned parades
Lovers who just slip away
Guess I learn to live that way
It only rains on me
Seems to me there was a time
It used to rain on friends of mine
Now I look around and find
It only rains on me
I'll bet this won't hurt you much
You'll find someone soon enough
I'm the one that loses in love
It only rains on me
It's time we said goodbye
And so I'll just take my cloud and go
Don't worry you'll forget I know
It only rains on meSometimes, Lord, it feels like,
The cards'll never fall my way.
And it seems like I spend a lot of time,
Just waitin' for my luck to change.
But I can see the end in the distance up ahead.
An' though I'm not there yet, I keep on going.
'Cause I made up my mind, somehow I will survive:
One a step at a time.
I know I'm gonna find a place,
To rest this weary soul,
Leave all the heartaches and tears behind,
An' get off this lonesome road.
So I'll be walkin' with tunnel vision,
To keep my mind off lookin' back.
'Cause fallin' for the wrong one,
Is what led me down this path.
But my day is comin' soon, mountains are in my rear view.
Already made it through the hardest part.
Nothin's gonna slow me down till I reach that sacred ground,
Won't be too long now.
I know I'm gonna find a place,
To rest this weary soul,
Leave all the heartaches and tears behind,
An' get off this lonesome road.
Instrumental break.
Someday I'll lay down those memories.
Feel, the sun on my face and the freedom under my feet.
I know I'm gonna find a place,
To rest this weary soul,
Leave all the heartaches and tears behind,
An' get off this lonesome road.
Get off this lonesome road.Listen to me baby, there's something that you must see
I want to be with you, babe, if you want to be with me
But if you gotta go, it's all right
But if you gotta go, go now, or else, you got to stay all night
It's not that I am asking you to take part in any kind of quest
It's just that I ain't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is
But if you gotta go, it's all right
But if you gotta go, go now, or else, you got to stay all night
I am just a poor girl trying to connect
I certainly don't want you thinking that I ain't got any respect
But if you gotta go, it's all right
But if you gotta go, go now, or else' you got to stay all night
It ain't that I am wanting anything that you never gave before
It's just that I'll be sleeping and it will be too dark for you to find the door
But if you gotta go, it's all right
But if you gotta go, go now, or else, you got to stay all nightWheels turn like my memories
And the head-lights shine like my used-to-be's
And time, time's taking way too long
And forgiveness, well I hope its not too far gone
[Chorus]
A hundred miles from her is where I need to be
And a hundred miles from now I'm gonna hit my knees
Say I miss you oh I love you and I'm sorry
And if she can find the way to take me back
I'll spend the rest of my life making up for the past
All my answers, all my hopes, All my fears
Are a hundred miles from here
I, I told her I had to go
And now I know what I didn't know
And this road could lead me back to your door
But can it take me to a girl who can love me more
[Chorus]I know what you think, here we go again
The same waste of potential that I've always been
I've been given the chances and I've burned some bridges up
Had a million excuses why I self-destruct
But this time around I'm a little more ready now
I'm a little bit older, a little more figured out
This time around
I see what I want, I've had a taste
I'm aware of the sacrifice it's gonna take
I ain't afraid of failure 'cause I ain't supposed to win
It took a while to find it but I'm back again
And this time around I'm a little more ready now
I'm a little bit older, a little more figured out
This time around
Yeah, this time around I'm a little more ready now
I'm a little bit older, a little more figured out
Yeah, this time around I'm a little more ready now
I'm a little bit older, a little more figured out
This time around
Yeah, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time aroundTwo kids holding hands in the driveway dreaming 'bout where to go
Ten miles out of town on the highway, Petty on the radio
You'd do anything to make me laugh
Yeah there's no wonder why I fell so fast
From the first time you opened the door
Well it felt like the beginning of something more
When this love, this love
Was nothing but a spark
And the dashboard has seen every kiss
And every downpour, every we're gonna make it through this
I know I'm home
No matter where we are
Me and you and
This car, this car,
This car, this car
Five years in the blink of an eye still smiling cause you're next to me
We fought, made up, got lost, made love in the back seat
So many stories in this steel and glass
Yeah there's no wonder why we fell so fast
From the first time you opened the door
Well it felt like the beginning of something more
When this love, this love
Was nothing but a spark
And the dashboard has seen every kiss
And every downpour, every we're gonna make it through this
I know I'm home
No matter where we are
Me and you and
This car, this car,
This car, this car
This car, this car,
This car
It's all I need
Baby I'll go anywhere just you and me
And this car, this car,
This car, this car
This car, this car
From the first time you opened the door
Well it felt like the beginning of something more
When this love, this love
Was nothing but a spark
And the dashboard has seen every kiss
And every downpour, every we're gonna make it through this
I know I'm home
No matter where we are
Me and you and
This car, this car,
This car, this car,
This car, this car,
This car
This car, this car,
This car, this car,
This car, this car,
This carScreamn' whitewall tires and a guitar by his side
Billy's got the fever as he rolls on through the night
Some were born to listen, some were born to play
He was lightning on the high strings and thunder on the bass
[Chorus]
He could play it high, he could play it low
He could make it cry, he could make it moan
He knows when push comes to shove
The proof's in the pickin'
In a smoky little tavern just off of Bourbon Street
Tobacco stained fingers waited on the down beat
Conley was the master, the undisputed king
He'd ruled the town for thirty years
With an army of six strings
[Chorus]
Sometimes after midnight Billy drives through New Orleans
Straight to the French Quarter there's a man he has to see
The music is a raging like a city that's on fire
Billy felt just like an altar boy at the feet of a higher power
Conley watched as Billy walked across the room
Opened his case and started a tune
The whole club was silent and the lights were turned down low
Billy stepped up on the stage and Conley whispered "Go son, go"
[Chorus]
Conley held his hand up, no one made a sound
And he handed Bill his old arch-top and stepped into the crowd
Billy played it soft, Billy played it sad
Then he made it talk and in came the band
Soon the room was shaking before Billy's wall of sound
And just a block off Bourbon Street, a new king's been crowned.
[Chorus]You have heard and read about the state of Tennessee
Down in the southern states is where I wanna be
Where the valleys are so green and mountains are so tall
You will know just what I mean when you hear them say "You all"
Tennessee
(Tennessee)
I hear you callin' me
(I hear you callin' me)
The home of Davy Crockett in the hills of Tennessee
When I was a little boy around the folks at home
My mama always said to me, "Jimmy, please don't roam"
Now that I have straight away my heart is full of woe
When I think of Mom and Dad that's where I wanna go
Tennessee
(Tennessee)
I hear you callin' me
(I hear you callin' me)
The home of Davy Crockett in the hills of Tennessee
If ever I get back to that state of Tennessee
I tell you there'll be no more roamin' for me
There lives a sweetheart who said, "She'd marry me"
As soon as I get back to that state of Tennessee
Tennessee
(Tennessee)
I hear you calling me
(I hear you calling me)
The home of Davy Crockett in the hills of TennesseeShe bloomed for me near a little village
In a cabin on the hill
We made our vows we'd love each other
And I know we always will
She's my rose of old Kentucky
I watched her bloom as the years roll by
And to me there'll never be another
I'll love her 'til the day I die
Oh in dreams I see my darling
In a gingham dress she looks so sweet
Oh I long for old Kentucky
And my darling was more to me
Oh I know you often wonder
So I'll tell you the reason why
She's my rose of old Kentucky
And I know she'll never lieI don't pick up the mail,
I don't pick up the phone,
I don't answer the door,
I just soon be alone
I don't keep this place up,
I just keep the lights down,
I don't live in these rooms,
I just rattled around
I'm just a ghost in this house,
I'm shadow upon these walls,
As quietly as a mouse,
I haunt these halls,
I'm just a whisper of smoke,
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire,
That once burned out of control,
You took my body and soul,
I'm just a ghost in this house
I don't care if it rains,
I don't care if it's clear,
I don't mind stayin' near,
There's another ghost here,
He sits down in your chair,
And he shines with your light,
And he lays down his head,
On your pillow at night
I'm just a ghost in this house,
I'm just a shadow upon these walls,
I'm living proof of the damage heartbreak does,
I'm just a whisper of smoke,
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire,
That once burned out of control,
You took my body and soul,
I'm just a ghost in this houseCrank it
Where she grew up there ain't no roads
Out in the sticks where the ginsing grows
She float down the river to get to school
Then her daddy come get her on a ole pack mule
She runs back and forth from shed to shack
Checking on the moonshine brewing out back
If you don't get the picture by now
Then wait a minute
(Chorus)
She got a bible, she's born again
She got a shotgun, she ain't afraid of sin
She's got rebel rising routy friends singing oohhh ohh ohhh
She got a Trans Am with a trailer hitch
She got horses, cows, and Dixie Chicks
She goes honky tonking just for kicks
If that ain't country
I, don't, know, what, is
She plant 50 acres, the seed in the hole
Come fall you get lost in the tall corns rows
Don't need know phone where she come from
She just holler from the mountain and the boys all run... fast
You might see her truck rolling out of the woods
With a 12 point buck laid across the hood
If you don't get the picture by now
Then wait a minute
Chrous
If you don't get the picture by now
Then wait a minute
Chrous
I don't know what is
I don't know what
I don't know what isI used to get more women than I put my hands on
And I put my hands on more than I can get
If I knew I have to do what I used to love to do
I got it back to do it on I bet
It takes me all night on to do what I used to do all night long
The wild and wooly days have come and gone
It takes me all night on to do what I used to do all night long
I'm not the young rooster but I was in my day
But I still like to close on anyway
I'm not the king of a chicken yard but I would keep all hens tired
To keep 'em up and it ain't rainy day
It takes me all night on...I can't believe the things I hear and see but there you are
Just as real as I can be
You made me happy baby so very happy baby
Loving you has sure been good to me
It's really you this time it's really true cause I can feel
Something tingling through and through
Well I want to thank you baby for everything you gave
Loving you has sure been good to me
Loving you has sure been good to me
When I was tired and down on livin'
Before my heart done high on lovin' you
I can't recall one day it didn't rain on me
You made my dreams worth dreamin'
You made my song worth singin'
You made the sun come out and shine for me
Know for now I got alone without you up till now
You're what love is all about
You came along and loved me when I was cold and lonely
Loving you has sure been good to me
Loving you has sure been good to me
Loving you has sure been good to me
Loving you has sure been good to meIt only hurts for a little while that's what they tell me that's what they say
It only hurts for a little while then all your heartaches will fade away
It's so easy to be smart with somebody else's heart
But I don't know how to start forgetting you what can I do
Oh it only hurts for a little while that's what they tell me just wait and see
My heart will break till you come back to me
My heart will break till you come back to me
(It only hurts for a little while)The coffee's all gone and my eyes burn like fire
It's way past the hour when most folks retire
You said that you'd call me but you haven't yet and I'm down to my last cigarette
I'm down to my last cigarette you're down to the last chance you'll get
For you're out there somewhere with someone you've met
And I'm down to my last cigarette
I can't leave this room you might call while I'm gone
The minutes seem hours soon will be dawn
And with every minute I give more upset and I'm down to my last cigarette
I'm down to my last cigaretteSee what you lost when you left this world, this sweet old world
See what you lost when you left this world, this sweet old world
The breath from your own lips, the touch of fingertips
A sweet and tender kiss
The sound of a midnight train, wearing someone's ring
Someone calling your name
Somebody so warm cradled in your arm
Didn't you think you were worth anything
See what you lost when you left this world, this sweet old world
See what you lost when you left this world, this sweet old world
Millions of us in love, promises made good
Your own flesh and blood
Looking for some truth, dancing with no shoes
The beat, the rhythm, the blues
The pounding of your heart's drum together with another one
Didn't you think anyone loved youI been walking, walking in the moonlight
Tripping in the starlight, Lord and I'm feeling down
Walking in the shadows, sneaking down a side road
Come early morning I'll be there on the edge of town
I was a thinking, thinking about a good thing
Thinking bout a sweet dream, in my honey's eyes
And I was a sinking', feeling kind of lonesome
Come early morning I'll be home at my honey's side
I have drifted up across the mountain
And I have stumbled down the other side
And I've been tempted, tried and troubled
Come early morning I'll be home and satisfied
She give me little loving, gives me little sunshine
Makes me have a good time, Lord when I'm feeling' blue
I couldn't refuse her, well I couldn't misuse her
Come early morning I'll be home with my honey dewHigh on the mountain tell me what do you see
Bear tracks bear tracks a lookin' back at me
Better get your rifle boys before it's too late
Cause bear's got a little pig and headed through the gate
Well he's big around the middle and he's broad across the rump
Runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' forty feet a jump
Ain't never been caught he ain't never been treed some folks say he's a lot like me
[ banjo ]
Saved up my money and I got me some bees
They started makin' honey way up in the trees
Cut down the trees cause my honey's all gone
Old Slew Foot's done made himself at home
Well he's big around the middle...
[ fiddle ]
Well winter's comin' on and it's twenty below
The river's froze over so where can he go
We'll chased him up to gully and we'll run him in the well
We'll shoot him in the bottom just to listen to him yell
Well he's big around the middle...
Some folks say he's a lot like meYou kindle the fire of love inside me
Each time our lips meet
I'm not strong when we're alone
Your kisses make me weak
You must know how I feel
But do you feel the same
Everytime you kiss me
You add fuel to the flame
My eyes light up when I see you
I burn with desire
Each time you're near
You say you'll care
But still I'm not sure
But please don't ask me to love you
If you're not gonna change my name
Everytime you touch me
You add fuel to the flame
This fire you started inside me
Has reached my very soul
You're adding fuel to a flame
That's already burning out of control
When you give me your name
I give you everything
Everytime you kiss me
Adds fuel to the flame
Yes everytime you touch me
You add fuel to the flameWhy'd I give my love away
Why'd I call out the unspoken
Why'd I change what seemed alright
To bring my love out in the open
When I socked it away for years
I guess I'd made a barricade
And hung my key by the door
So that's what secrets are for
There's a storm coming down in the morning
With a freezing rain to add to our worries
And I won't speak of these things anymore
I'll just bury them down in drifts of snow
Where spring may come to see them grow
There's a storm coming down from Virginia
And a woman's heart that yearns for the sun
And I won't speak of these things anymore
I'll just bury them down under drifts of snow
Where spring may come to see them growAll gathered 'round in our Sunday best
After the service on them old church steps
Congregation spilling into the streets
Ain't it funny how the preacher's words
Disappear out here on the curb
Once the weight of an old friend's body and your hands meet
Tending bar up in Syracuse
Momma called when she got the news
Hell, I don't know who she'll miss more, you or me
No, it didn't feel real, no not 'til now
Behind this long black Lincoln in our little town
Rolling by buildings I never thought again I'd see
Chorus:
And I can't help but think about all that we could have been
Had you not stayed here and settled for a life with him
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Buried is the secret that was us
I can still see you standing there
Swollen eyes and snow in your hair
And your shaking voice say you couldn't get past the shame
Eight weeks into a nine month ride
Either way it's still a lie
Carrying your child with another man's name
Repeat Chorus
I walk up and shake his hand, tell him just how sorry I am
And what I wouldn't give to have you back
I wonder if you're looking down on all who is gathered 'round
Knowing one day I too will find peace
Repeat Chorus
Buried is the secret that was usI was dancin' with my darlin to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see.
I introduced him to my darlin' and while they were dancin'
My friend stole my sweetheart from me.
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darlin' the night they were playin'
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz
Now I wonder how a dance like the Tennessee Waltz
Could have broken my heart so complete
Well I couldn't blame my darlin', and who could help fallin'
In love with my darlin' so sweet
Well it must be the fault of the Tennessee Waltz
Wish I'd known just how much it would cost
But I didn't see it comin', it's all over but the cryin'
Blame it all on the Tennessee Waltz
She goes dancin' with the darkness to the Tennessee Waltz
And I feel like I'm falling apart
And it's stronger than drink and it's deeper than sorrow
This darkness she left in my heart
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
'Cause I know just how much I have lost
Yes I lost my little darlin' the night they were playin'
That beautiful Tennessee WaltzJesus Christ, with signs followin',
serpents in the air.
Hellbent on heaven bound,
your earthly end is near.
Guarded by the divine,
we're practicin' our faith.
There's more than chance at work here,
or strychnine in this place.
Jesus Christ, with signs following,
serpents up in the air.
Hellbent on heaven bound,
your earthly end is near.
Hellbent. For heaven bound!
Hellbent for heaven bound...
Lost me 15 years ago,
they say I lost my faith.
Now at home with the Lord of you,
someone has taken my place.
Jesus Christ, with signs followin',
serpents up in the air.
We're hell bent upon heaven bound,
your earthly end is near.
Hellbent. For heaven bound!
Hellbent for heaven bound.
Hellbent for heaven bound
Hellbent for heaven bound...When no one else can understand me when everything I do is wrong
You give me hope and consolation you give me strength to carry on
And you're always there to land a hand in everything I do
That's the wonder the wonder of you
And when you smile the world is brighter you touch my hand and I'm a queen
Your kiss to me is worth a fortune your love for me is everything
I guess I'll never know the reason why you love me like you do
That's the wonder the wonder of you
And I guess I'll never know the reason whyWe spend our lives in searching for happiness
I found it once and tossed it a side
I paid for it
With hours of lonelyness
I've nothing to hide
I'd bury my pride for
Just one more chance
To show that you alone I'd care for
Each night I'd say a little prayer for
Just one more chance
Just one more night
To taste the kisses that enchants me
I'll want no others if you'll grant me
Just one more chance
I've learned the meaning of repentance
Now you're the jury at my trial
I know that I should serve my sentence
Still I'm hopin all the while that you'll give me
Just one more word
I know that I was glad to start out
But now I'm back to crying my heart out
For just one more chanceI had to have the gun to get the gold and I had to have the gold to get the girl
She wanted things I couldn't buy I knew I'd lose her love
And she was everything in life that I've been dreaming of
And desperation one dark night began my life a crime
I knew where someone captured a gun and now the gun was mine
I had to have the gun to get the gold and I had to have the gold to get the girl
I robbed and stole I even killed to win her for my own
Then found her in an another's arms one night when I came home
I drew my gun they tried to run never made the door
And by their side I threw the gun I wouldn't need no more
No I wouldn't need the gun to get the gold
For I wouldn't need the gold to get the girl
Now very soon I'll meet my doom the rope hangs just outside
But when I found her in his arms that's when I really died
Oh I had to have the gun to get the gold and I had to have the gold to get the girl
Oh I had to have the gun to get the gold and I had to have the gold to get the girlThere's no reason I should go
When I really want to stay
There's no place that I know
I'd go to anyway
If ya ask me, I'll take Texas any day
There's folks who travel 'round
Ain't no place they will stay
And never can be found
Anywhere but on their way
But you can find me here in Texas any day
There's everything and more than you could hope to find
From the sandy beaches to the mountains and the pines
My mind's got room to wander
But my heart will never stray
And you can find me here in Texas any day
There's no reason I should go
And you really ought to stay
By now you've got to know
There's only one thing I could say
If ya ask me, I'll take Texas any dayWell I love her
And I love to fish
I spend all day out on this lake
And hell is all I catch
Today she met me at the door
Said I would have to choose
If I hit that fishin' hole today
She'd be packin' all her things
And she'd be gone by noon
Well I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lake shore
And I'm sittin' in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
That I'm gonna miss her
Oh, lookie there, I've got a bite
Now there's a chance that if I hurry
I could beg her to stay
But that water's right
And the weather's perfect
No tellin' what I might catch today
So I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lake shore
And I'm sittin' in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
Yeah, I'm gonna miss her
Oh, lookie there, another biteShe just started liking cheatinsongs
Chorus
She just started liking cheatinsongs
And what's bothering me
I don't know if it's the cheatinshe likes
Or just the melody
I've never had any reason to doubt her
As far as I know she's been true
But lately she's had a different look in her eyes
I wonder if she's seeing somebody new
You can't blame a body for looking
And there's a world of people out there
But I hope she's not taking any closer looks
I tell you lately, frankly I've been scared
Chorus
I've got to admit I do some looking too
But she's the only one I love
She still tells me she loves me
But I wonder if my love's enough
Chorus
Yeah, I don't know if it's the cheatinshe likes
Or just the melody1. If Jesus comes tomorrow to spend some time with you
Would you answer all His questions or lie to hide the truth?
Would you welcome Him with open arms, or even let Him in?
If Jesus comes tomorrow, what then?
2. If Jesus calls your number, could you leave today?
Are you ready to lay down your worldly goods and walk away?
Would it take a month of Sundays just to tell Him of your sin,
If Jesus comes tomorrow, what then?
3. If the sky turns black as midnight in the middle of the day
and somehow you knew that Jesus would soon be on His way,
Would you have to beg forgiveness, or could you reach out and take His hand?
If Jesus comes tomorrow, what then?It seems like I was there from the start
A witness to your wild and reckless heart
You showed me the way but now you're gone
Quicker than the trigger of an outlaw's gun
Living fast and dying young
A victim of this road you left me on
White line took my baby
Led him down that dark highway
Headlight-blind driving crazy
If my wheels keep turning
Gonna roll that white line away
We worked the road as hard as we could drive her
But now I am the only survivor
From night to night at every place I play in
The sweetness of your song remains
I'll be the keeper of the flame
'Til every soul hears what your heart was saying
White line took my baby
Led him down that dark highway
Headlight-blind driving crazy
If my wheels keep turning
Gonna roll that white line away
All the nights you spent alone
All the love I'd never shown
All the words I could not say
That white line took you away
White line took you away
I'll follow this white line down where it's winding
'Cause somewhere up ahead your light's still shining
The sound of the silver strings will guide me
I've stood and watched the bridges burn
I'm past the point of no return
Oh how I wish that you were here beside me
White line took my baby
Led him down that dark highway
Headlight-blind driving crazy
If my wheels keep turning
Gonna roll that white line away
White line took my baby
Led him down that dark highway
Headlight-blind driving crazy
If my wheels keep turning
Gonna roll that white line away
White line took my baby
Led him down that dark highwayI got high hopes that tomorrow is gonna be better than today
It don't look like it's comin' I know, why not believe it anyway
Call it a prayer, call it a dream, Call it a leap of faith, call it anything
I got high hopes that tomorrow is gonna be better than today
I got two hands that ain't afraid to work hard and I jump out of bed every day
I know these times are real hard, lookin' on the bright side always pays.
Call it a prayer, call it a dream, Call it a leap of faith, call it anything
I got high hopes that tomorrow is gonna be better than today
I know it's dry, but that's gonna change,
No I ain't felt a dropbut I can smell the rain,
Call it a prayer, call it a dream, Call it a leap of faith, call it anything
I got high hopes that tomorrow is gonna be better than today
It don't look like it's comin' I know, why not believe it anyway
Oh why not believe it anywayMy love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop
Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear
The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you
I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenueGod rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
From God our heavenly father
The blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Fear not said the angel
Let nothing you alright
This day is born a savior
Of the pure virgin bright
To free all those who trust in him
From Satan's power and might
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear savior lay
They found him in the manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His mother Mary knelled down
And to the Lord did pray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joyPeace in the valley for me some day
Well, I'm tired and so weary, but I must travel on
'Til the Lord comes and calls me away, oh, yes
Where the morning's so bright and the Lamb is the light
And the night is as bright as the day, oh, yes
There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see
Only peace in the valley for me, oh, yes
Well, the bear will be gentle and the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh, yes
And the beasts from the wild shall be led by a little child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh, yesShe sits among the pieces of broken glass and photographs
Reluctantly releases the last of what was her past
It struck without a warning or did she just ignore the signs
In those dark clouds forming behind her silver lines.
Then the door it slammed like thunder and the tears they fell like rain.
And the warnings from her family whirl like a hurricane.
Oh, she's drowning in emotions and she cannot reach the shore.
She's alive but can she survive the storm.
A broken jewel box dancer lies in pieces down the hall.
She's finding out the answers don't change nothing at all.
It's time that she stopped searching for who's to blame or what went wrong.
The only thing for certain is he's gone,
she's got to move on.
Then the door it slammed like thunder and the tears they fell like rain.
And the warnings from her family whirl like a hurricane.
She's drowning in emotions and she cannot reach the shore.
She's alive but can she survive the storm.
Someday days just roll on by without a gray cloud in the sky.
She keeps telling herself, "I will make it on my own".
And her friends they've all gone back to their lives,
Thinking she will be alright,
As she races through the night to make it home.
The door it slams like thunder and the tears they fall like rain.
And the warnings from her family whirl like a hurricane.
Oh, she's drowning in emotions and she cannot reach the shore.
She's alive but can she survive the storm.In grave in my mind there are pictures mem'ries of a love I knew one time
So I find in my thoughts I stand looking
At the mem'ries hanging on the walls of my mind
I see a mem'ry of raindrops falling in the park on the day we met
Walking with each other through the rain laughing talking as we both got soak and wet
The mem'ry made that day I could never put away
That's the day he told me he'd be mine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
And I have a mem'ry of springtime cherry blossoms and bird singing on the vine
And the secret place we'd hide and laid together side by side
And the love that shined so brightly in his eyes
Springtime I recall was the sweetest time of all
That's the season our hearts became entwine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
Through the spring and summer he loved me and his love died with autumn leaves
His love was the wild and restless kind
When he left he left with me so many memories
He left them hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
Mhm mhm hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
He left them hanging on my mindI was walking after midnight
Yeah, out in the moonlight the way we used to do
I'm always walking after midnight
Searching for you
I'm always walking after midnight
Searching for you
I stop to see a weeping willow crying on his pillow
Maybe he's a-crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
The night winds whisper to me I'm lonesome as I can be
I'm always walking after midnight
Searching for you
I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that's just my way of saying love you
I'm always walking after midnight
Searching for you
I walk for miles along the highway
Searching for you
I'm always walking after midnight
Yeah, out in the moonlight
Hoping you may be somewhere
A-walking after midnight searching for me
I'm always walking after midnight
Searching for youWell, I asked you to dance
Now my nose is broken
Must've said somethin' wrong
Gosh, I was just jokin'
But it's hard not to cry
With a gussied up eye
My face sprayed with mace
If ya didn't want to dance
You could've just said so
And if I'd only ducked fast
Then I wouldn't have bled so
Do you think there's a chance
You could call an ambulance?
Oh God, I'm in pain
You have no right to remain violent
That kick to my crotch
Uh, that was very uncalled for
You continued to beat and beat me
'Till I was black and blue
I've been wantin' you
But not any longer
'Cause it's brutally clear
That you're so much stronger
I'm madder than fire
My jaws are both wired
One hell of a date
I didn't know my bladder had failed me
Until I looked down at my pants
I think I'm in desperate need of hospitalization
But I ain't got no danged insurance
You have no right to remain violent
That kick to my crotch
Uh, that was very uncalled for
You continued to beat and beat me
'Till I was black and blue
I've been wantin' you
But not any longer
'Cause it's brutally clear
That you're so much stronger
'Cause I'm madder than fire
My jaws is both wired
That's one hell of a date
I bought a camcorder
Got a restrainin' order
Now lay you're hands on me
I guess that's what you get when you ask a perfect strangerSometimes I think about the touch of your skin
The taste of your lips and It all comes rushing back again
And I start to spin
I think about you when the skies turn grey
Always reminds me of the love we made
Back when you were here
Well, here come the tears
Of yesterdays rain
Yesterday's rain
Well, it's better to have loved and lost than not at all
But I still love to feel it fall
Yesterday's rain
It's just yesterday's rain
Well, I've been told I shouldn't stand in your rain
That's the only place I see your face
I can see you face
It took sometime to heal but I've moved on
I still go back in time and stand in your storm's
Familiar's ones
Always feels like home
Of yesterdays rain
Yesterday's rain
Well, it's better to have loved and lost than not at all
But I still love to feel it fall
Yesterday's rain
It's just yesterday's rainEveryday I rush right home,
Just like you were there waitin' on me,
To put the final touch on one more day.
There's always no answer when I call your name,
But I act as though nothing's changed;
It's easier for me to live this way.
As if I didn't know you left me,
I pretend you're right here in my arms.
I don't see what it hurts to still love you;
No, I don't see any harm.
So I go on as if I didn't know,
As if I didn't know.
Every night it's the same routine,
Off to sleep in search of a dream,
Where we're as happy as we ever were.
And I'll admit I've gotten good,
At makin 'em end the way the way they should;
That way I can deal with all this hurt.
As if I didn't know you left me,
I pretend you're right here in my arms.
I don't see what it hurts to still love you;
No, I don't see any harm.
So I go on as if I didn't know,
As if I didn't know.Ya know sometimes in your life
You may find it hurts to be in love
Specially when you and the one ya love
Already belong to somebody else
You're tied to her and I'm tied to him
And we don't wanna hurt either one of them
That's how it is
When you're married but not to each other
Ya gotta go home in the middle of the night
Try and pretend every things alright
But it ain't, no it ain't
When you're married but not to each other
Make believe that you've been good
Give your love to the one you should
But you can't, no you can't
'Cause you're tied to her and I'm tied to him
We don't wanna hurt either one of them
So what can you do, what can you do?
When you're married but not to each other
Ya gotta be careful everywhere you go
Tryin' to avoid everyone you know
'Cause people talk, you know they talk
When you're married but not to each other
You've gotta make up alibis
Hopin' they don't sound like lies
'Cause if you get caught, and ya might get caught
Hurry up and love him
Hurry up and please him
And when it gets right
You've got to leave him
You better leave him
'Cause you're tied to her, I'm tied to him
We don't wanna hurt either one of them
That's how it is, that's how it is
When you're married
But not to each other
Hurry up and love him
Hurry up and please him
And when it gets right
You've got to leave him
You better leave himHe's got a split finger wrap
And his rope's pulled way too tight
He's got a lunatic smile
'Cause he's really drawn deep tonight
He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever
Grab a hold-a anythin' and hold on tight
It hits you like a venom from a rattlesnake bite
We're all here 'cause he's not all there tonight
He takes one last breath
And time turns inside out
Then the gate busts open
To the world he dreams about
He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever
Stick a rope on anything 'cause he don't care
He'd even take a ride in an electric chair
We're all here 'cause he's not all there tonight
He says it's really kind of simple
Keep your mind in the middle
While your butt spins 'round and 'round
Take heed to Sankey's preachin'
Keep liftin' and reachin'
And ridin' like there ain't no clowns
Well what he loves might kill him
But he's got no choice
He's a different breed
With a voice down deep inside
That's screamin' he was born to ride
He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever
Fever makes you crazy 'cause it makes no sense
Like runnin' from your shadow out of self-defense
But he won't run and baby he can't hide
He thinks the odds are even leavin' one hand tied
He gets so tired of hangin' on so tight
I know you think he's crazy, well I think you're right
We're all here 'cause he's not all there
That's right!(Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way)
Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Oh jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way..
(A day or two ago I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny bright was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank misfortune seem'd his lot
He got into a drifted bank and then us got upsot)
Oh jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way...
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the wayMy parents raised me tenderly,
They had no child but me.
My mind being placed on rambling,
With them I couldn't agree
Just to leave my aged parents
And them no more to see.
There was a wealthy gentleman
Who lived there very near by.
He had a beautiful daughter,
On her I cast an eye.
She was so tall and slender,
So pretty and so fair.
There never was a girl in this whole wide world
With her I could compare.
I asked her if it differed
If I crossed over the plain.
She said, "It makes no difference
If you never return again."
We too shook hands and parted,
And I left my girl behind.
I started out in this wide world
Strange faces for to see.
I met little Maggie Walker
And she fell in love with me.
Her pockets all lined with greenback
In her labor I'll grow old,
Now if you'll consent to marry me
I'll say I'll roam no more.
I traveled out one morning,
To the salt works I were bound.
And when I reached the salt works
I viewed the city all around.
Work and money were plentiful
And the girls all kind to me.
But the only object to my heart
Was a girl in Tennessee.
I traveled out one morning
Down on the market square.
The mail train being on arrival,
I met the carrier there.
He handed me a letter,
So's I could understand
That the girl I left in Tennessee
Had married another man.
I drove on down a little further
And found that it was true.
I turned my horse and buggy around
But I didn't know what to do.
I turned all around and about there --
Bad company I'll resign;
I'll drive all about from town to town
For the girl I left behind.She says, 'I'm getting that lonely sinking feeling,
You know what I mean?'
With his hand on her back he's thinking,
'Where does that leave me?'
Just when I think I've uncovered the secret
To peace and tranquility
That lonely sinking feeling creeps up on me
He says, 'I'm seeing those doubt filled
Questioning eyes
And I can't believe it's true'
With her head in her hands she sighs,
'It's me, not you'
Just when I thought that I'd discovered the joy
Of loving one so completely
That lonely sinking feeling creeps up on me
Here in this silent room we wait on ancient ritual
Staring at our hearts
As if they were two caged animals
If I am the first to unlock those rusty doors
Will I be the first found bleeding on the floor?
She says, 'I'm getting that lonely sinking feeling,
You know what I mean?'
With his hand on her back he's thinking,
'Where does that leave me?'
Just when I think I've uncovered the secret
To peace and tranquility
That lonely sinking feeling creeps up on me
Just when I thought that I'd discovered the joy
Of loving one so completely
That lonely sinking feeling creeps up on me
That lonely sinking feeling creeps up on meVerse 1
Now the season is turning, turning
The air is getting colder,
as we get a little older
We remember all the fun and games
weve had over the years
it goes by slow, but dont let go
'cause soon it disappears
Chorus
Suddenly its over
As quick as it began
A graduates party
To warm nights on the sand
but this isnt California
Our summers have to end
just remember our hometown
Where everything began
Verse2
By now I hope your learning
that Your not the only one
Wishing for the spring to come
Then you notice how the years
flown over us so fast
no more hellos, time to let go
'cause now its in the past
Pre-chorus
Im not the only one at night
who wonders what it will be like
To finally live out our life
if well be alright
i think its right to sing a song
for everyone to sing along
it wont be long until were gone
Dont let go, Hold on.
Chorus
Suddenly its over
As quick as it began
A graduates party
To warm nights on the sand
but this isnt California
Our summers have to end
just remember our hometown
Where everything began
Bridge/Pre-chorus
Now look where weve gone
Weve been together so long
its hard to Move on
i think its right to sing this song
for everyone to sing along
it wont be long until were gone
Dont let go, Hold on.
Chorus
Suddenly its over
As quick as it began
A graduates party
To warm nights on the sand
but this isnt California
Our summers have to end
just remember our hometown
Where everything Began. X4Looking back
On the memory of
The dance we shared
'Neath the stars above
For a moment
All the world was right
How could I have known
That you'd ever say goodbye
And now
I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end
The way it all would go
Our lives
Are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd have had to miss
The dance
Holding you
I held everything
For a moment
Wasn't I a king
But if I'd only known
How the king would fall
Hey who's to say
You know I might have changed it all
And now
I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end
The way it all would go
Our lives
Are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd have had to miss
The danceI gave my love a cherry without a stone
I gave my love a chicken without a bone
I gave my love a ring without an end
I gave my love a baby with no cryin'
How can there be a cherry without a stone
How can there be a chicken without a bone
How can there be a ring without an end
How can there be a baby with no cryin'
A cherry when it's blooming it has no stone
A chicken when it's pipping it has no bone
A ring when it's rolling it has no end
A baby when it's sleeping has no cryin'(Steve Rhymer/Elizabeth Rhymer)
Hail, hail to the newborn king
Let our voices sing him our praises
Hail, hail to the guiding light
That brought us tonight to our savior
Ale, alleluia, alle, alleluia
Ale, alleluia, alle, alleluia
Come now, there it shines so bright
To the knowing light of the stable
Lean close to the child so dear
Cast aside your fear and the thankfulI was cleaning out the closet, throwin' things away
I'd forgotten all about it, when I looked, there it lay
I picked it up, found a frame and hung it in the hall
But there's more behind this picture than the wall
It was taken on that trip we took back in '92
Casey sure didn't look like me, Lord, he looked like you
We had no way of knowing then, just how the cards would fall
Yeah, there's more behind this picture than the wall
Casey joined the army, they sent him far from home
Lori moved to Hollywood, pre-tending she was grown
You and I held on and tried, to make sense of it all
There's more behind this picture than the wall
Too soon our little family, was scattered to the wind
You fell out of love with me, wouldn't fall back in
I was sleepin' by myself the night I got that call
Yeah, there's more behind this picture than the wall
Casey died a hero, that's what the Chaplin said
We couldn't find sweet glory, our doubt ain't over yet
You and I still tortured by the memories we recall
There's more behind this picture than the wall
Four happy lovin' faces, back then we had it all
But there's more behind this picture than the wall
Than the walGod gave me the will to survive, a good strong back and a mind
And all the tough stuff it takes to fill a man's shoes
Then God put this heart in me for you
It pushes the blood through my veins
To swing this nine pound hammer one more day
But there's only one reason why it beats so true
God put this heart in me for you
This heart really don't belong to me
This heart will be yours eternally
The man upstairs put it there 'cause
He knows what to do
I'd be nothin' but flesh, blood and bones
If I had to walk through this world alone
Just a ramblin' fool, a blind, stubborn brute
Without this heart in me for you
This heart really don't belong to me
This heart will be yours eternally
The man upstairs put it there 'cause
He knows what to do
God put this in my for you
Yes, God put this heart in me for youShe's got three kids, no husband
She's two weeks late on last month's rent
She's waitin' on the child support
He keeps swearin' that it's coming
But if she knows him, she knows where it went
And that pile o' bills ain't gonna pay themselves
It's been a forty-hour week and it's only Tuesday
And there's homework and dinner to make
Somebody wants a lullaby
Somebody wants a different channel
Somebody's dealin' with their first heartbreak
And the dishes in the sink ain't gonna wash themselves
She lights a cigarette out on the balcony
When she gets a couple minutes to herself
There's how you plan it out, and how it turns out to be
And a broken home, it ain't no fairytale
She's got three kids, no husband
And a hairnet job at a diner down on Main
She knows damn well
She don't make the best cup o' coffee
But she's quick with a smile and good with names
Those lunch tickets ain't gonna tip themselves
She smokes a cigarette out by the loading dock
And tries not to pick the polish off her nails
She thinks about a guy who's been coming in a lot
She starts to dream and then she stops herself
She's got three kids, no husband
So she's a mom and a dad and a taxi driver
When the baby's sick, she's an up-all-nighter
A hand and a shoulder and a referee
A real-life hero if you ask me
'Cause those kids ain't gonna raise themselvesWould you lay with me in a field of stone
If my needs were strong would you lay with me
Should my lips grow dry would you wet them dear
In the midnight hour if my lips were dry
Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
Wipe the blood away from my dying hand if I give myself to you
Would you bathe with me in the stream of life
When the moon is full will you bathe with me
Will you still love me when I'm down and out
In my time of trials will you stand by me
Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
Wipe the blood away from my dying hand if I give myself to you
Would you lay with me in a field of stone
If my needs were strong would you lay with meI was headed north on Highway 5
On a starlit Sunday night
When a pick-up truck flew by me out of control
As I watched in my headlights,
He swerved left and then back right
Never hit the brakes as he left the road
I found him lying in the grass among steel and glass
With an empty whiskey bottle by his side
Through the blood and tears, he whispered in my ear
A few last words just before he died
And he said, "Don't tell mama I was drinking
Cause Lord knows that her soul would never rest
Now I can't leave this world with my mama thinking
That I met the Lord with whiskey on my breath"
I still think about that night
And how that young man died
And how others sometimes pay for our mistakes
Well the last thing on his mind
As he left this world behind
Was knowing someone else's heart would break
And he said, "Don't tell mama I was drinking
Cause Lord knows that her soul would never rest
Now I can't leave this world with my mama thinking
That I met the Lord with whiskey on my breath"
"Don't tell mama I was drinking
Cause Lord knows that her soul would never rest
Now I can't leave this world with my mama thinking
That I met the Lord with whiskey on my breath
That I met the Lord with whiskey on my breath"I got back in town a day before I'd planned to
I smiled and said I'll sure surprise my wife
I don't think I'll phone I'll just head on home
For I didn't know the cold hard facts of life
I passed a little wine store on the corner I pictured pink champagne by candle light
I stopped the car right then got out and hurried in
My mind not on the cold hard facts of life
A stranger stood there laughing by the counter
He said I'll take two bottles of your best
Her husband's out of town and there's a party
He winked as if to say you know the rest
I left the store two steps behind the stranger
From there to my house his car stayed in sight
But it wasn't till he turned into my drive I learned
I was witnessing the cold hard facts of life
I drove around the block till I was dizzy each time the noise came louder from within
And then I saw our bottle there beside me
And I drank a fifth of courage and walked in
Oh you should have seen their frantic faces
They screamed and cried please put away that knife
I guess I'll go to hell or rot here in the cell
But who told who the cold hard facts of life who told who the cold hard facts of lifeThat lonely night we got carried away with each other
Remains with me though they'll never be another
Warm drinks soft lights and slow dances
When two blue people were the victim of circumstances
Circumstances the wrong arms the right time
Circumstances was her charms or just a wine
Would it happen again if we had enough chances
Or would we even want each other under different circumstances
What is done is over and just a memory the night they set a sign for you and me
Oh but the dreams this foolish heart romances
Of the night when we were victim of circumstances
Circumstances the wrong armsJust passin' time with everyone I meet
I'm just passin' time as I wander through the streets
Just passin' time, wrestlin' with thoughts that fight my sleep
She left behind, just passin' time
I'm just passin' time inside these empty rooms
I'm just passin' time where small lost hopes still loom
Just passin' time appears unlikely to heal any wounds
Love is kind, I'm just passin' time
And time hangs around more every day
Why I keep searching
For a place that old thoughts might stay
And not just end up right back in my heart's way?
Time don't ever answer nothin' new
Least not here lately
In any way that I could use
For figurin' out what's left to loseHey it was bumper to bumper on the town square
Windows rolled down feel the summer air
We would bark the tires peeling outta there
To make the girls stare, make the girls stare
Drive from the Sonic across the railroad tracks
Down to the mall then make your way back
Take your Route 44 coke and pour out half
Make room for Jack, fill it up with Jack and it was
Oh oh
Yeah, were kings and queens
Oh oh
Cruising South Jackson Street
Oh oh
Riding up and down that all night merry go round
Oh oh
Just more of the same old same
Oh oh
Making memories with time to waste
Oh oh
And it ran out we took
One last lap around this town
Hot little honey climbing up on in my truck
Rolling along sitting shotgun
Look like a firecracker coming undone
Make your heart jump, jump, jump, like
Oh oh
Yeah, were kings and queens
Oh oh
Cruising South Jackson Street
Oh oh
Riding up and down that all night merry go round
Oh oh
Just more of the same old same
Oh oh
Making memories with time to waste
Oh oh
And it ran out we took
One last lap around this town
And every time I come back here
It takes me back to the years
When we would drive around and around
And around and around singing
Oh oh
Yeah, were kings and queens
Oh oh
Cruising South Jackson Street
Oh oh
Riding up and down that all night merry go round
Oh oh
Just more of the same old same
Oh oh
Making memories with time to waste
Oh oh
And it ran out we took
One last lap around this townThere's no room in my heart for the blues
Love is satisfied to either win or lose
Darling if our pathway parts let's that be no broken hearts
There's no room in my heart for the blues
There's no room in my memory for tears
We left back on and be forgotten souvenirs
If your hungry heart forgets let there be no sad regrets
There's no room in my heart for the blues
There's no room in my life for a sigh
We'll be strong enough to face our last goodbye
Darling when our romance ends let us part as best of friends
There's no room in my heart for the blues
There's no room in my heart for the blues
Love is satisfied to either win or lose
Darling if our pathway parts let's that be no broken hearts
There's no room in my heart for the bluesHang down your head Tom Dooley hang down your head and cry
Hang down your head Tom Dooley poor boy you're bound to die
I met her on the mountain and there I took her life
I met her on the mountain and stubbed her with my knife
Hang down your head Tom Dooley
This time tomorrow reckon where I'll be
If it hadn't been for Grayson I'd've been in Tennessee
Hang down your head Tom Dooley
This time tomorrow reckon where I'll be
In some lonesome valley a hangin' on a white oak tree
Hang down your head Tom DooleyLet the beer bottle
Rattle on my pistol
On the seat of my Chevy pick up truck
And I'm taking these gravel roads
As fast as my truck will go
I'm running like a scared white tail buck
It was a long night card game
With Earl Ray and Bobby
And some ol boy they worked with from Adair
That boy didnt like me
Then he said I was cheatin
Gun shots rang out on the midnight air
I dont wanna see the day light
But my Becky's alone tonight
I wonder if shes waiting up for me
I'm gonna hide out in the bottom
Where I hunted deer and turkey
I know that swamp like the back of my hand
Hell I was born and raised here
Just wanted to be a good ol boy
Never thought I'd ever be a wanted man
But soon they gonna catch me
Aint no way around that
Cause I dont know any other place to hide
I wonder if Becky's Bible is still in the glove box
Cause I'm sure gonna need it if that boy died
I dont wanna see the daylight
But my Beckys alone tonight
I wonder if she's waiting up for me
Sometime tomorrow morning
When I ought to be fishing
They'll probably be hauling me in
I'll be sittin in the jail house
No need to be wishing
I'll ever get to fish the green river again
I"ll be prayin for some daylight
Cause my Becky's alone tonite
I wonder if she's waiting up for me.
I Wonder if shes waiting up for me.I don't love you anymore
We've all heard those words before
Somebody takes your heart and then
Leaves you the pieces
Lying shattered on the floor
They say that when you close a door
Another one is waiting there
For you to open, if you believe!
[Chorus]
Love will come back
Hit you when you least expect it
Fill in the cracks
Of a broken heart you thought
That you could never mend
You, you can start again!
When you're barely getting by
And it's hard to find the strength to try
And loneliness is all you've known
If you let go, then you will find
[Chorus]
Oh, when you think you've lost the only way
All you really need
Is a little faith
[Chorus]
Just let love return to you
You can start again!I've been around
a block or two
I've never seen nothin quite like you
You like to drink
smoke, tell dirty jokes
Your not the kinda girl
take home to your folks
But I'm so into you
and the things you do
I wouldn't change one thing
If you'd only take this ring
cause I'm so into you
I hope you say I do
Cause I'm so into you
I love your soft brown hair
big brown eyes
that beautiful smile
drives me wild
and no other could make me feel
the way you do
Cause I'm so into you
and the things you do
I wouldn't change one thing
If you'd only take this ring
cause I'm so into you
I hope you say I do
Cause I'm so into you
Cause I'm so into youWell, you've called my kinfolk trash all their lives
And I'm a chip off the heap, ask any one of my ex-wives
I'm a social drinker, and I stay social all I can
I'm a deer-snuffin', chain-smokin', simple kinda southern man
First you gut our farms, strip-mall all the five-and-dimes
Then you tax our so-called sins, call our pleasures a crime
Now you're turnin' our music into some strange elevator noise
Think it's time for us to win one back for the good ol' boys
You can paint stripes on a billy goat/call it a tiger if it floats your boat
You can make a star of a teenage girl
But one million dollars won't make her Merle
Laser beams, navel rings, and a pretty face might be something
But you can kiss my Ozark ass, if that's country
There's a certain song that's got my local station stuck
It's got a steel guitar, and I believe it mentions a truck
But the singer don't sound like he ever worked a stick shift
Sounds more like bad Phil Collins with a hick facelift
Now I ain't denyin' them suburban moms their fun
But don't you try to tell me it's the way hank wanted it done
You better keep your money-grubbin' hands off the poor man's song
And make sure Chris Gaines stays the hell offa my front lawn
You can take an ear from a barnyard sow/milk it 'til it turns into a cash cow
You can lead a chick to a watering-hole
But you can't make her drink 'til she gets white soul
Might be rock, might be schlock, might be the Beatles or monkeys
But you can kiss my Ozark ass, if that's countryOnce I was a slave at the saw mill
Talk about a poor boy talk about a poor boy let me have a dollar bill
My work was so hard at the saw mill
Talk about a poor boy talk about a poor boy let me have a dollar bill
See my teardrops falling down my wife left the saw mill town
She said saw mill life had been a sin the gravy were too thin
I can't work no more at the saw mill
Talk about a poor boy talk about a poor boy let me have a dollar bill
[ steel ]
Well if you bring your wife to the saw mill
How you gonna please her how you gonna please her when she wants a dollar bill
She'll run away and leave you at the saw mill
Women like a dollar women like a dollar yes and women always will
See my teardrops falling down...
Women like a dollar women like a dollar yes and women always willI'm glad you called me, I still feel your voice
Touch something inside me but I have no choice
But to tell you I'm no longer one of boys
And I can't get to you from here
Now I don't think you'd know me if you saw me up close
I've built me a family and I don't like to boast
But I'm all settled in to what I need the most
And I can't get to you from here
I can't turn back the years
And get crazy again and have nothing to fear
Easy as it might appear
I just can't turn my back and get there from here
I only bet when I've got all the cards
I don't take on all comers when they come on too hard
I'm a daddy and a voter and I go to bed tired
And I can't get to you from here
I can't turn back the years
And get crazy again and have nothing to fear
Easy as it might appear
I just can't turn my back and get there from here
Well I only bet when I've got all the cards
I don't take on all comers when they come on too hard
I'm a daddy and a voter and I go to bed tired
And I can't get to you from hereWell lovin' you sure is great I follow every step you take
I'm watchin' every move you make oh baby
Don't you know honey child you really got a lovin' kind
I'm lovin' everytime you smile oh baby
Oh oh oh I get this feeling when I'm close to you
Oh oh oh now I can think of anything better
When you and me alone together
I love lovin' you baby
You got to be one of the kind cause everything you do is so fine
Well I think it's all a dream some time oh baby
Lovin' you sure is great I'm watchin' every move that you make
And I follow every step that you take oh baby
Oh oh oh I get this feeling when I'm close to you
Lovin' you sure is great I'm watchin' every move that you make
And I follow every step that you take oh babyOklahoma Girl
Fell in love with an Oklahoma girl
She stole my heart took over my world
She lit my cigarette and never had to ask
One look and I was gone like that
That's ok I don't mind
This Texas boy just might find something in that Oklahoma girl
Met that girl she took me where I've never been before
Miles away from my so-called live I didn't really care
She took me there.....
Made a 2-hour drive to stay one night
A kiss on the lips made it all feel right
Her hands through my hair and her head on my chest
The whole day we stayed in bed
That's ok I don't mind
This Texas boy just might find something in that Oklahoma girl....
Met that girl she took me where I've never been before
miles away from my so-called life I didn't really care
she took me there....
I crossed the state line about an hour ago
got all week to brag to everyone I know
who roll their eyes and shake their heads
have their doubts
make their bets.....
But that's ok, I don't mind
This Texas boy just might find something in that Oklahoma Girl....
Met that girl she took me where I've never been before
Miles away from my so-called life I didn't really care
she took me there...
[Thanks to Noah for lyrics]By a lonely prison wall
I heard a young girl calling
Micheal they are taking you away
For you stole Trevelyn's corn
So the young might see the morn.
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay.
Low lie the Fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly.
Our love was on the wing we had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry.
By a lonely prison wall
I heard a young man calling
Nothing matter Mary when your free,
Against the Famine and the Crown
I rebelled they ran me down
Now you must raise our child with dignity.
Low lie the Fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly.
Our love was on the wing we had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry.
By a lonely harbor wall
She watched the last star falling
As that prison ship sailed out against the sky
Sure she'll wait and hope and pray
For her love in Botany Bay
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry.
Low lie the Fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly.
Our love was on the wing we had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry.Come and sit by the side of your mother my boy
You have only a moment I know
And stay while I give you this parting advice
It is all that I have to bestow
Hold fast to the right hold fast to the right
Wherever your footsteps may roam
Oh for sake not the the way of salvation my boy
That you've learned from your mother at home
In your satchel you'll find there's a Bible my boy
It's the book of all others the best
It will teach you to live and prepare you to die
And will take to the gates of the blest
Hold fast to the right hold fast to the right...
[ ac.guitar ]
Hold fast to the right hold fast to the right...
Oh hold fast to the rightWe don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee and we don't take trips on LSD
We don't burn our draft cards down on Main Street
Cause we like living right and being free
And we don't make a party out of loving but we like holding hands and pitching woo
We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy like the hippies out in San Francisco do
And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball
We still wave Ol' Glory down at the courthouse
And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all
Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen
Football's still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids here still respect the college dean
And I'm proud to be an OK
And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all (in Muskogee Oklahoma USA)My little boy on the kitchen floor
(My little Basquiat)
Stick men fighting stick dinosaurs
(My little Basquiat)
Colors leaping all over the mat
(My little Basquiat)
The kitchen floor is where it's at
For my little Basquiat
One day he'll be golden
Maybe chosen perhaps to lead
One day he'll be shaken
Maybe taken perhaps to bleed
My big girl swinging from the bars
(My little comaniche)
Fist of stone flying above the yard
(My little comaniche)
Halfway up is halfway down
(My little comaniche)
Now maybe it's the other way around
For my little comaniche
One day she'll be moonlight
Maybe too bright perhaps to shine
One day she'll be found out
Maybe ground down, perhaps she'll cry
My little girl on her mother's lap
(My little panchen lama)
Sucking on her fingers, surveying the road map
(My little panchen lama)
Seems to be the only one around
(My little panchen lama)
That sees the red lights at the end of town
My little panchen lama
One day they'll be older
Maybe bolder perhaps than me
One day they'll be rising
Maybe living perhaps in peace
One day they'll be older
Maybe bolder perhaps than me
One day they'll be rising
Maybe living perhaps in peace
Perhaps in peace
Perhaps in peace
Perhaps in peaceThere's a cabin in a valley my grandpa built on your land
Your mountains are a canvas for the Maker's hand
Tonight I'm fishing up a river if only in my mind
No, I haven't seen her banks in such a long, long time
I carry you in my heart
Your memory comes over me like the dark and
Like a phone call from my baby
Sayin' honey I miss you like crazy
Like a sound of a siren song
Oh Carolina you callin' me home, callin' me home
Sometimes I grow weary from goin' all the time
I love to take a minute let you ease my mind
I'd love to see my mama, maybe go for a drive
But I gotta play the star in some little town again tonight
Don't get me wrong I love what I do
It's just another song about missing you
Like a phone call from my baby
Sayin' honey I miss you like crazy
Kind of like a siren song
Oh Carolina you keep callin' me home, callin' me home
Callin' me home, callin' me home, yeah
Oh, oh, I'm almost home
Like a phone call from my baby
Sayin' honey I miss you, I miss you like crazy
Just like a sound of a siren song
Oh, Carolina, Carolina, Carolina keep callin me home, callin' me home
Callin' me home, callin' me home
Carolina, Carolina keep callin' me homeOh, I know a place called Good Time Charley's
A little four piece band swingin' out of sight
And I'll be here if you want to party
Come nine in the morning 'til twelve at night
Two miles from town 'cross the railroad track
Turn right at the light and park in the back
You're always welcome, don't forget to drop in
Old Good Time Charley's, any time you can
Well, I heard talk 'bout a trouble-maker
Dropped in one night and never came again
Well, they said he left with an undertaker
Old Charley's done time, two years in the pen
Well, the beat goes on, there's a hardwood floor
And the sound of laughter runnin' out the door
Wall to wall women, plenty of ice-cold beer
Anything you're after you can find in hereYou'll never be sorry if you let me love you
You'll never be lonely if you let me care
If you'd let me hold you, you'll know what I told you is true
You'll never be sorry if you let me love you
The first time I saw you I could not forget you
I felt I had known you all of my life
I have been faithful to you since the moment our eyes said hello
You may think I'm crazy, there's only one way you will know
You'll never be sorry if you let me love you
You'll never be lonely if you let me care
If you'd let me hold you, you'll know what I told you is true
You'll never be sorry if you let me love you
Once in forever fate brings us together like this
Someday when we're older we'll laugh and remember
Those moments before we first kissedMy Jesus sandals are missing
I think I left them on the back of the stage
With the angry divorcee
Who was trying to help me get away
They were like sleds made of gentle leather
They would always carry me safely through
I don't wanna put back on my boots...
I don't wanna but I'm gonna put on my boots
And this really is no hoax
My toenails are buried and not breathing
Bending, yellow, and coarse
I don't wanna put back on my boots...
I don't wanna but I'm gonna put on my bootsI'm a ship, I'm a ship, I'm a ship
Out on the sea
None of my love
Floating wild come back to me
So I write you a letter, I'll write you a letter
With this here pen
Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
'Cause I'm your friend
I'm in love with the garden
That is down the street
And the earth is a warm thing under my feet
And the earth is a warm thing under my feet
Oh, long streams of light
Lift me from this dirty town
'Cause I am losing stain
Soak me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
With rain, rain, rain, rain
Oh, I'm a ship, I'm a ship, I'm a ship
Out on the sea
And all these clouds flying by so fast
Well, they confuse me
And the long leaves in the tall trees
Pale in the sunshine
And I was twistin' and turnin'
In the cool sheets past bed time
Plant me in the garden
Don't you let me roam
'Cause love is a feeling like a warm dark stone
Plant me in the garden
Don't you let me roam
'Cause love is a feeling like a warm dark stone
Yeah, love is a feeling like a warm dark stone
Love is a feeling like a warm dark stone
Plant me in the garden
Don't you let me roam
'Cause love is a feeling like a warm dark stone
Yeah, love is a feeling like a warm dark stone
Love is a feeling like a warm dark stoneThe groceries are gone, my pay cheque is spent.
They turned off the water; I'm behind on my rent.
Last night I drank my last beer,
And where do I go from here?
I've been laid off since Monday before.
The union is holdin' out, hopin' for more.
Well, I could be laid off for years.
Oh, where do I go from here?
Where do I go from here?
Sittin' at the kitchen table,
Staring at my unpaid bills.
Sometimes I feel so unable:
It's the boredom, not the worry that kills.
Oh where do I go from here.
Where do you go when nobody needs you?
Why can't you sleep when there's nothin' else to do?
And why are your thoughts so unclear?
Oh, where do you go? Where do you go?
Where do you go from here?
I don't like complaining and I could use a rest,
But my sofa and chairs just got repossessed.
And my pride is the next thing, I fear.
Oh, where do I go? Where do I go?
Where do I go from here?
Tell me where do I go? Where can I go?
Where can I go from here?You've come to tell me something you say I ought to know
That he don't love me anymore and I'll have to let him go
You say you're gonna take him oh but I don't think you can
Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man
Women like you they're a dime a dozen you can buy 'em anywhere
For you to get to him I'd have to move over and I'm gonna stand right here
It'll be over my dead body you better get out while you can
Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man
[ ac.guitar ]
Sometimes a man start lookin' at things that he don't need
He took a second look at you but he's in love with me
I don't know where they leave you oh but I know where I'll stand
And you ain't woman enough to take my man
Well women like you...
No you ain't woman enough to take my manWe were twins to be born that day
But I could never let it be that way
Mama's life line proved a good noose
With a taste for killing, I was on the loose
My folks hated me for what I did that day
So I slit their throats, sent 'em to their grave
I headed for the Smokie's in Tennessee
Yeah, lot of good killing was ahead of me
I'm a killer on the lamb
Hey, I don't mind living with some blood on my hands
Your life to me ain't worth a damn
To this killer on the lamb
Met a mountain girl from a mining town
Our first time when the sun went down
All she wanted was to marry me
So I cut her where she loved me
And watched her bleed
Her daddy from the holler saw her blood so red
So I drug him in the river and I drowned him dead
I'm a killer on the lamb
Hey, I don't mind living with some blood on my hands
Your life to me ain't worth a damn
To this killer on the lamb
Wore out my welcome in Arkansas
Killed a Christian family of the Pentecost
Georgia Cracker was a talking at me
So I cut out his tongue, hung from a tree
Now the southern law wants to put me in jail
But I'll still be killing when I'm burning in hell
I'm a killer on the lamb
Hey, I don't mind living with some blood on my hands
Your life to me ain't worth a damn
To this killer on the lamb
To this killer on the lamb
To this killer on the lambLet me be your baby, hold me close tonight
Kiss away the teardrops till the mornin' light
Help a lonely lady make it through the night
Let me be your baby, tell me it'll be all right
Rock me in the cradle of your lovin' arms
Wrap your love around me, keep me safe & warm
Tell a bedtime story & gently tuck me in
Let me be your baby, don't let me be alone again
Be my lovin' daddy & sing a lullaby
Promise me you'll never make your baby cry
Help a lonely lady make it through the night
Let me be your baby, tell me it'll be all right
Let me be your baby, tell me it'll be all rightThere's a big bright moon above and the night's just made for love
Baby I'm ready if you're willing
Well that twinkle in your eye is a darin' me to try baby I'm ready if you're willing
Now baby can't you see I'm waitin' for you to make up your mind
No use in hesitatin' can't you see we're wastin' time
Don't you think that love is grand let me be your lover man
Baby I'm ready if you're willing
Well I like the way you smile would you like to spoon awhile
Baby I'm ready if you're willing
And I like the way you kiss oh let's go on like this baby I'm ready if you're willing
Now baby can't you see I'm waitin'...Like a desert calls the rain on the hottest driest day
And when those storm clouds hit it comes alive
Like a guitar calls for strings, without 'em it can't sing
About that girl, she's my world, the one thing on my mind
Is that riding down the road, her shotgun with me
Those come-to-bed eyes when she's had too many
That way she don't have to say a thing
She's callin' my name
That wink when her dress starts falling
The way she's gotten my heart wrapped up all in one look
She don't even say a thing
And she's callin' my name
Like a jukebox calls for change so it can pick a love song to play
Just like last call calls for one more drink
Is that riding down the road, her shotgun with me
Those come-to-bed eyes when she's had too many
That way she don't have to say a thing
She's callin' my name
That wink when her dress starts falling
The way she's gotten my heart wrapped up all in one look
She don't even say a thing
She's callin' my name, callin' my name
Her kiss, her touch says please stay longer
Every day her love gets stronger
She's callin' my name
With every glance it just gets louder
I can't help but think about her
She's callin' my name
Is that riding down the road, her shotgun with me
Those come-to-bed eyes when she's had too many
That way she don't have to say a thing
She's callin' my name
That wink when her dress starts falling
The way she's gotten my heart wrapped up all in one look
She don't even say a thing
She's callin' my name
That girl is callin' my nameUp against the wall
You don't stand so tall
Better run run run put your armor on again
She is 12 years old
Nothing she don't know
She says you're 32 but you want to be 16
I know that you did not receive
What it was that you needed when you were
Growing
But tell me what's the worth
You're repeating history verse by verse
What do you prove
No matter what you say I think you'll lose
You'll lose
You'll lose her
Up against the wall
You don't stand so tall
Better run run run put your armor on again
Isn't it time we recognized that we all live
Such broken lives sometimes
And it's sad but true that you still carry so
Much with youI remember when you first arrived
Medicated, till barely alive
And I watched with wonder as color returned to your cheeks
Thinking of the words I'd say, should we ever get the chance to speak (I'd say)
Stand up, don't be foolish
You got one life to live, may as well start it now
Get your hands up, come on let's do this
It's just you and me baby and all the time we're allowed
I remember when you first awoke
Eyes like steel, voice like velvet rope
You said you'd been dreaming of a man who looked like me
Who gave the most sincere advice without the slightest hint of irony
(saying)
Stand up, don't be foolish
You got one life to live, may as well start it now
Get your hands up, come on let's do this
It's just you and me baby and all the time we're allowed
We all thought you would grow strong
Who knew we could be so wrong
I remember when you first broke loose
Some chased after, I said what's the use
Everybody comes around here looking for a change
Happy are the ones who learn it's not so odd to be strange
Stand up, don't be foolish
You got one life to live, may as well start it now
Get your hands up, come on let's do this
It's just you and me baby and all the time we're allowIts hard to keep tears out of my eyes
This might be our last goodbye
Our country calls you to defend a great land
So do your part just like a man
Down where the river bends
With God's help we'll meet again
Under the same old sycamore tree
Proud of each other and the land of the free
I go down to the ocean blue
Its just as close as I came to you
This old ocean might keep us apart
But it won't keep you dear out of my heart
If the worst should happen and the poppies should wave
Over your far distant, lonely grave
All the rest of my life I'll spend in prayer
I'll meet you in heaven there'll be no war thereWhen I bought this guitar it had brand new strings
brand new strap all those things
brand new pick both thumb and flat
all the elementary things like that
I went ahead and took it everywhere I went
couldn't count the hours that I must have spent
I heard the girl was lookin' for a guitar man
An' I'll oblige her anyway I can
'Cause I can win her over
like Romeo an' Juliet
If I can only show her
I can learn to pick that legato lick like Chet
It'll take more than Mel Bay 1, 2, & 3
If I'm ever gonna play like CGP
My legato is staccato but what I don't fret
is droppin' any note that I don't get
'Cause I can win her over
like Romeo an' Juliet
If I can only show her
I can learn to pick that legato lick like Chet
I can win her over
like Romeo an' Juliet
If I can only show her
I can learn to pick that legato lick like Chet(Precious sacred seems unfold)
Twenty one boy twenty one
Now you were just a young feller son the night your mama died
You don't remember but we were right there by mama's side
Your ma had a sickness son all the works she'd done
And she prayed all her life that God would let her raise you to be twenty one
Now me and you never moved the town boy we just kept on living here
And life's been pretty tough son with the past twenty one years
I remember when you were just a little feller I sued to take you to church
And it seemed my boy in the choir
With the other boys kinda give old dad's heart a jerk
You sounded like a little angel boy and to me you sure did look sweet
Even though your little ragged britches came halfway to your little feet
After the service was over it filled your papa's heart full of joy
When the preacher petted you on your little head
Looked over me and say you sure got a fine little boy
Then me and you we'd get in the wagon and you'd look over me and smile
Then I'd hand you the line and let you drive the team for a while
Yeah boy me and you had lot of fun we smiled through a lot of tears
And I wish you could have been a boy for a many million years
But if it's true son that time takes its toe
That's why the boys grow up and men grow old
Yeah life's been tough for you and me too son
And I prayed to God to let me raise ye to be twenty one
But tonight my life's bout over and my work on earth's bout done
I guess I'll go to see the Lord and live with your mama
Cause tonight son you're twenty oneWell I'm crazy about fast cars, football and guitars
All them old country songs Daddy used to play
I'm crazy about Friday nights, cold beer and good times
Crazy about a summer day out on the lake
But I'm ten times crazier without about your lovin', girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy bout a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you
Well I'm all about a weekend, kickin' with my good friends
Every now and then I like to make a little noise
But don't you go thinkin' that I won't leave 'em hanging
'Cause even though I'm crazy about them good ol' boys
I'm ten times crazier about your lovin' girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy bout a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you
I know you love me girl that's easy to see
But as crazy as you say you are about me
I'm ten times crazier about your lovin' girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy bout a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you
I'm ten times crazier about your lovin' girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy bout a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about youI've been waiting here in Louisville
Lots of time to kill, waiting here for you
I've had to get a job in Louisville
Cause my hotel bill is six weeks overdue
You called to say you were leaving
That Kentucky was half away
I love this old river town but I never meant to stay
I've been waiting here in Louisville
You got until my bus leaves for L.A.
Let's not fool ourselves there's something wrong
You don't belong to me now I can tell
Six long weeks it took, but it's a game
You never meant to come to Louisville
You come to see here believing
That Kentucky was half away
I love this old river town but I never meant to stay
I've been waiting here in Louisville
You got until my bus leaves for L.A.
You come to see here believing
That Kentucky was half away
I love this old river town but I never meant to stay
Six long weeks this took but it's a game
You never meant to come here anyway
I've been waiting here in Louisville
You got until my bus leaves for L.A.
You got until my bus leaves for L.A.I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreamsWe're far apart but our hearts are holding hands
Yes it's hard to sit here by myself each night
Not knowing where you are or when I'll hold you tight
Yes I have temptations sometimes it's pretty rough
But temptation's never strong as our sweet love
Cause our hearts are holding hands across the miles
Even though we're lonely we can smile
Cause I know you're my woman and I know you're my man
We're far apart but our hearts are holding hands
[ steel ]
Today a stranger looked my way and flashed his gold
And said he'd buy me all the treasures I could hold
But I took out your last letter where you wrote you love me so
And there I found the strength to tell him no
Cause our hearts are holding hands...
And come what may our hearts are holding handsI know I'm ready now
To love you like you want me to
I've finally figured out
That I depend on you
I haven't started loving you yet
So don't stop loving me now
Don't do something we'll both regret
Don't stop loving me now
You've seen me running round
Trying to live to fast
I swear I'm slowing down
I know what I want at last
Don't say you're walking out
Now that I've finally changed
My life is turned around
So don't stop loving me now
I know I'm ready now
To love you like you want me to
I've finally figured out
That I depend on you
I haven't started loving you yet
So don't stop loving me now
Don't do something we'll both regret
Don't stop loving me now
Don't stop loving me nowIt can happen any moment
Without reason or rhyme
It might be right around the corner
Or it'll come up from behind
A picture that I thought would fade
I still clearly see
When the thought of you
Catches up with me
it can happen on a Sunday drive
The sky above a shade of blue
Headed down some lonesome highway
Then you come into view
Mile after mile goes by
But you're all I see
When the thought of you
Catches up with me
when the thought of you comes to mind
It'll carry me away to a better place and time
it can happen in the dead of night
Any day of the week
Sometimes you'll come find me
When I'm in bed asleep
And I'll have that dream about you
I sure love what I see
When the thought of you
Catches up with meWell I guess I've been traveling light my whole life through
Thought if you never own nothing much, nothing ever owns you
Until I looked at you I swear I never gave one thought to forever
Girl, I never wanted to
Find a little spread with a creek running through
Build a little dream and make it come true
But now I want to with you
Girl, I want to with you
Put a little ring, third finger, left hand
Stay with somebody
Who will love and understand
Girl, I want to with you
When a man ain't looking no telling what he may find
Until I saw the light of your love I was walking round blind
I kept running with my restless heart
Thinking that's just the way things are
Girl it never crossed my mind
I think it's time
Just find a little spread with a creek running through
Build a little dream and make it come true
But now I want to with you
Girl, I want to with you
Put a little ring, third finger, left hand
Stay with somebody
Who will love and understand
Girl, I want to with you
I'm gonna find a little spread with a creek running through
Build a little dream and make it come true
But now I want to with you
Girl, I want to with you
Put a little ring, third finger, left hand
Stay with somebody
Who will love and understand
Girl, I want to with youHey Mr ting-a-ling steel guitar man
Play me some lonesome as sad as you can
My baby has left me for some other man
Play on Mr ting-a-ling steel guitar man
Play me a song that will bring on the tears
Make me remember those beautiful years
Play me a picture of her if you can
Play on Mr ting-a-ling steel guitar man
[ steel ]
Play me the shadows of my lonely room
Cry like a whippoorwill lost in the gloom
I love her I miss her don't you understand
Play on Mr ting-a-ling steel guitar man
Hey Mr ting-a-ling steel guitar man...I remember the day when the snow melted away and the great snowman was wed
He said yes I do and little Linda said it too and the great snowman was wed
Well Jimmy Jones was the snowman's name he put all the other local lovers to shame
He had good looks and a real fine car went around breaking all the pretty girls' hearts
Until one day the great snowman found Linda Lou started melting him down
He bought the ring and they named the day
And the great snowman started melting away
I remember the day...
Now the great snowman and his loving spouse live in a little subdivision house
They've got six kids and a mother in law another kiddie comin' in the fall
His old Cadillac needs the paint retouched it's full of baby diapers and bottles and such
The great snowman he has outgrown all his fancy cuddy clothes
I remember the day...
And the great snowman was wedI gave you a child, and you didn't want it
Thats the most that I have to give.
I gave you a house, and you didn't haunt it
Now where am I supposed to live.
I gave you a tree and you did not embrace it
I gave you a nightmare and you didn't chase it
I'd give you a dream and you'd only wake from it
Now I'll never go to sleep again.
I'd give you a treasure and you'd only take from it
Look at the hole where jewelry had been
Baby oh baby
Why must you escape from it
This love that we once called our friend.
(hoo ooo, ooo. hoo ooo ooo...)
I gave you my body and you ate aplenty
I gave you ten lives and you wasted twenty.
Now I'm standing empty, helpless and bare, without a morsel left of me to give
And you, you have vanished, into the air
The air in which I must liveLove me and I'll be your best friend and you won't have to be alone ever again
I'll sing with you in the sunshine I'll shelter you from the raindrops and the wind
Love me and I'll be your best friend
I wanna be your lover and and slowly spread your hair down on my pillow
I wanna hold you close to me and feel your gentle breathing on my skin
And when the loving's over I'm gonna wrap my arms around your shoulders
Look you in the eyes whisper baby that's the best it's ever been
Then I wanna lie with you and listen to the thoughts that you've been thinking
Found out where you coming from what it really is that makes you fly
I want you to know I'm somene you can go and rest your troubles
Whatever you can cross or a mountain you can climb up to the sky
Love me and I'll be your best friend...Everybody always knew she belonged to him
Since kinder garden they were best of friends.
Their parents called it puppie love
But puppies know the deal
Jamie and jen knew it was real.
Her first day with glasses on jen wouldnt go to school
Jamie showed up at her door grinning like a fool
In his Daddys horn rims she laughed until she cried
He said let them call us both four eyes
(Chorus)
And he said God made your Mother so you would always have a friend
Your sister and brother to fight with now and then
God made your Father to show you what a man should be
And he knew youd need someone to always love you thats why God made me
Her senior year of high school they drifted apart
They both experienced their first broken heart
Jen met a new boy made a bad mistake
She hasnt seen him since that day
She waited for her Mom and Dad to come home from work
She didnt know her best friend called Jamie first
He showed up at her door and said I know things look bad
Why dont we tell them im the Dad?
(Chorus)
In five years they've added to their family
and the one who dont look much like jamie
last night at bed time he said where did I come from?
I dont look like the babies, I dont look like you and mom
(Chourus)
god made your father and thats who ill never be but he knew you would need someone to always love you..thats why God made meDeath is an angel sent down from above sent for the buds and the flowers we love
Truly 'tis so for in heaven's own way each soul is a flower in the Master's bouquet
Gathering flowers for the Master's bouquet beautiful flowers that will never decay
Gathered by angels and carried away forever to bloom in the Master's bouquet
Loved ones are passing each day and each hour passing away as the life of a flower
But every bud and each blossom some day
Will bloom as a flower in the Master's bouquet
Gathering flowers for the Master's bouquet...
Now let us be faithful till life's work is done
Blooming with love till the reaper shall come
Then we'll be gathered together that day
Transplanted to bloom in the Master's bouquet
Gathering flowers for the Master's bouquet...Your broken heart is fading fast
You found a love you think might last
and last
The sweetest thing you've ever seen
The kind thats always in your dreams
in your dreams
She don't know that she's perfect
She does not have a clue
What she's done to you
She don't know that she's perfect
Better find the words to say
Don't let her walk away
Don't get me wrong
Don't think me strange
There's nothing about you girl
I wanna change
I'd never change you
But the day has come and now's the time
I'll find a way to make you say you're mine
Mine, all mine
She don't know that she's perfect
You'd better let her know
Before she turns to go
I hope and pray she'll understand
That one fine day
I might be her man
Be her man
We'll find a place down in the sun
Where she and I can live as one
By faith
Till the endOh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time
Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
But my love for you could never grow no stronger
If I lived to be a hundred years old
Oh it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time
Now you say you've found someone that you love better
That's the way it's happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow
Cryin' time will start when you walk out the doorI wish I could step out of my mind
Then I could be someone that's never known you
But I can't change the way I am much less the way you feel
Or you'd be loving me forever still
I can't stop the winter from turning into spring
Or summer giving way to autumn winds
But if I could take the world and make it face the other way
Then you'd love me forever again
If I had a way of changing time
I?d stay busy turning back the pages
If I could make a miracle, I'd make one just for you
And you'd be loving me forever too
I can't stop the winter from turning into spring
Or summer giving way to autumn winds
But if I could take the world and make it face the other way
Then you'd love me forever again, you'd love me forever againPacked my things and went away a thousand years ago today
For I had places to go and things to see
I had a girl who loved me so and she begged me not to go
But I left and took her pleading words with me
I'll be waiting always waiting I love you and I'll miss you while you're gone
I know you have to do what your heart tells you to
So I'll be waiting till it tells you to come home
All the things I'd hoped to find I soon learned I'd left behind
So I told myself oh boy let's us go home
Cause our darling's waiting there and she said she'd always care
And the echo of her promise leads me on
I'll be waiting always waiting I'll be waiting till your heart tells you come home
I'll be waiting always waiting
Well I got back home today and I almost wished I'd stay away
For I left here with a smile and now I weep
Oh she kept her promise alright and she's waiting here tonight
Still waiting neath the ground where she's asleep
I'll be waiting till your heart tells you come homeThe moment I gave in
To the pleasures of man
Some they called it weakness
While others called it sin
Oh brother, hear the trouble
That I'm in
Well I made a lot of money
And I bought a lot of things
And I held many women
'N they tried to marry me
But the pardon never came
Before the plea
Now they're long gone
And things I've said and done
Have always been completely if I please
Now I feel I can say
In the morning that is today
Trying to find a better way to be
For a man like me.
I remember as a young man
Well I played the hand they dealt
While I tried to bury
All the ways it felt
But as a man I thought you knew me
Fairly wellHoney I know you got a good job
Out there making all that dough
They keep late working that overtime
And I don't ever see you no more
Guess your not checking your message machine
Seem like your never in
Oh but I got a hunch, if we can just do lunch
I can get your attention again
I know you got your schedule and your keeping it tight
You got something going morning noon and night
But I got something here I think your gonna like
Honey can you squeeze me in
Who ever said it's a mans world
Don't know what he's talking about
You got me working around the clock
Honey trying to figure you out
I know time is money
There's more to life honey
Than how much you can spend
You gotta make a little time for the good times
Honey can you squeeze me in
I got it circled in red on the calendar, baby
You told me that tonight's the night
I've got the Champaign chilled
I've got a gourmet meal, soft music and candlelight
I try to get you on the phone and I get stuck on hold
I guess you keep getting sidetracked
I've been faxing you love notes all day long
I know you got your schedule and your keeping it tight
You got something going morning noon and night
But I got something here I think your gonna like
Honey can you squeeze me in
Who ever said it's a mans world
Sure knows what he's talking about
You got me working around the clock
Honey trying to figure you out
I know time is money
There's more to life honey
Than how much you can spend
You gotta make a little time for the good times
Honey can you squeeze me in
Who ever said it's a mans world
Don't know what he's talking about
You got me working around the clock
Honey trying to figure you out
I know time is money
There's more to life honey
Than how much you can spend
You gotta make a little time for the good times
Honey can you squeeze me in
Let's make a little time for the good times
Honey can you squeeze me inWind blowing on my face
Sidewalk flying beneath my bike
A five year old's first taste
Of what freedom's really like
He was running right beside me
His hand holding on the seat
I took a deep breath and hollered
As I headed for the street
You can let go now, daddy, you can let go
Oh, I think, I'm ready to do this on my own
It's still a little bit scary but I want you to know
I'll be okay now, daddy, you can let go
I was standing at the altar
Between the two loves of my life
To one, I've been a daughter
To one, I soon would be a wife
When the preacher asked
"Who gives this woman?"
Daddy's eyes filled up with tears
He kept holding tightly to my arm
'Til I whispered in his ear
You can let go now, daddy, you can let go
Oh, I think, I'm ready to do this on my own
It's still feels a little bit scary but I want you to know
I'll be okay now, daddy, you can let go
It was killing me to see the strongest man I ever knew
Wasting away to nothing in that hospital room
You know he's only hanging on for you
That's what the night nurse said
My voice and heart were breaking
As I crawled up in his bed and said
You can let go now, daddy, you can let go
Your little girl is ready to do this on my own
It's gonna be a little bit scary but I want you to know
I'll be okay now, daddy, you can let go, you can let goI'm the prettiest boy that you will ever see
Life keeps bringing me down
Whenever I'm trying living above my means,
Life keeps bringing me down
Yeah, life keeps bringing me down
Blues keep coming around
Hard living's gonna be the death of me,
Life keeps bringing me down
When the times roll in and the sun won't shine
Life keeps bringing me down
Now I'm hard on the bills and work for a dime
Life keeps bringing me down
Yeah, life keeps bringing me down
Big tears drops hitting the ground
Well, it won't stop raining on this heart of mine
Life keeps bringing me down
Yeah, I hate to wake up when the morning comes,
Life keeps bringing me down
But I frank upon a coffee and I'm on the run
Life keeps bringing me down
Yeah, life keeps bringing me down,
The world keeps spinning around
Yeah, if ain't no racing, ain't no fun,
Life keeps bringing me down
I've got a number of death to crawl out from under
Life keeps bringing me down
But one of these days I'm gonna hit the numbers,
Life keeps bringing me down
Yeah, life keeps bringing me down,
I won't cry down to the ground
Yeah, it's been a bummer the whole damn summer,
Life keeps bringing me down
Yeah, life keeps bringing me down
Yeah, life keeps bringing me downCome back to me when roamin' days are over
Go have your fling go dance and sing and get it over
Come back to me when laughter turn to sorrow
Though you must roam love's best at home think of tomorrow
Come back to me when life has lost its lure I'll be near sincerely yours
I understand I know that you must leave me
Go on and roam then come back home come back to me
Come back to meOh the games people now every night and every day now
Never meanin' what they say now and never sayin' what they mean
While they wile away the hours in their ivory towers
Until they're covered up with flowers in the back of a black limousine
Lotten da da da da lotten da da a dee da dee
Yes we're talkin' bout you and me and the games people play
Make one another cry break a heart then we say goodbye
Cross our hearts and we hope to die that the other one's to blame
But neither one will ever give in so we gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' bout the things that might have been and it's a dirty rotten shame
Lotten da da da da...
Your friends're walkin' up to ya singing glory hallelujah
As they're tryin' to sock it to ya in the name of the Lord
They're gonna teach you how to meditate read your horoscope and cheat your fate
And furthermore to hell with hate come on and get on board
Lotten da da da da...
Look around and tell me what you see what's happened to you and me
God grand me the serenity to just remember who I am
Cause we've given up our sanity for our kind and our vanity
Turn our back on humanity and we don't give a lot
Lotten da da da da...
Yes we're talkin' bout you and me and the games people playWell, I wish that I was on old Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Cause there ain't no smog, no smoke on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bill
Now but once I had me a man on Rocky Top
Half bear the other half cat
Well, he was wild as a mink but he was sweet as soda-pop
I often think about that
Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee
Now once two strangers climbed ol' Rocky Top
Lookin' for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top
And some say they never will
Did you know corn don't grow at all on Rocky Top?
The dirt's too rocky by far
And that's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar
Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee
Now I've had years of cramped up city life
Trapped luck a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a dad-burn pity
Life can't be simple again
Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee
Rocky Top, Tennessee
Tennessee, Rocky TopBaby, I couldn't hide
No matter how hard I tried
Was foolish to have begun
To believe I'd ever outrun
And honey I had no call
To try and escape at all
'Cause by the time I got free
Love caught up to me
Baby, I used to have ways
To avoid anyplace
That even had half the chance
To cut in on my dance
Yeah, my cool heart hung around
Only if it couldn't be found
But showed up permanently
When love caught up to me
The fascinations of each lie
I told myself were reasons why
The feeble boast I made alone
Sound faded worn and all outgrown
Hey, I could never afford
Honey, all it would cost
To replace what you do
If it ever got lost
But baby, I'd beg and steal
Just to keep how I feel
A way I never did need
Till love caught up to me
The fascinations of each lie
I told myself were reasons why
The feeble boast I made alone
Sound faded worn and all outgrown
Baby, I couldn't hide
No matter how hard I tried
Was foolish to have begun
To believe I'd ever outrun
And honey,I had no call
To try and escape at all
'Cause by the time I got free
Love caught up to me
Yeah, by the time I got free
Love caught up to meIt's two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe
The onions are frying the neon is bright and the jukebox is startin' to play
And the sign on the wall says In God We Trust all others have to pay
And it's two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe
The short order cook with the momma tattoo he's a turnin' them hamburgers slow
Eggs over easy whole wheat down, y'all want that coffee to go
He never once dreamed as a rodeo star that he'd wind up here today
At two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe
There's a tall skinny girl in the booth in the back wearin' jeans and a second hand fur
She's been to the doctor then called up a man
And now wonders just which way could turn
She stares at her coffee then looks toward the ceiling
But Lord it's a strange place to pray
At two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe
There's a guy in a tux and he stands in the corner feedin' the jukebox his dimes
He just had a woman and thought that he'd bought
But found he'd just rented some time
And he couldn't sleep so he came back to see if anyone else wants to play
At two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe
Now there's an old dollar bill in the frame on the wall
The first one that Rose ever made
It was once worth a dollar a long time ago but like Rose it's beginnin' to fade
She's back of the register dreamin' of someone and how things would be if he'd stay
But it's two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe
The stoop shouldered man and his frizzy haired woman
It's strange how their eyes never meet
He's playin' the pinball she's fixin' the blanket of the baby asleep on the seat
He's out of work she's puttin' on weight and they never did have too much to say
It's two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe
The waitress Darlene she sits at the counter paintin' her fingernails blue
And the short order cook he yells move it or lose it and pick up an order of stew
But someday a rich handsome man'll walk in and carry her far far away
From two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe
The shaggy haired hippie he's finished his meal
And he's countin' the change in his jeans
Burger and coffee are 85 cents and he's only got 23
He smiles at Rose and she winks back at him but Lord that's a high price to pay
At two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe
The baby faced sailor he leans on the phone and dials the number again
While the guy in the tux tells the girl in the jeans bout wonderful places he's been
And a wino comes in off the street and starts shoutin'
Bout fortunes that he threw away
And Rosalie's asking the shaggy haired hippie if he's got a warm place to stay
And the short order cook takes a five from the till while Rosie's looking away
And the onions keep frying the neon is bright and the jukebox continues to play
And it's two in the morning on Saturday night at Rosalie's Good Eats Cafe[CHORUS]
Got no reason now for go-in' home
All my rea-son's now she is gone
Got no one there to talk to talk to and e-ven though I know
I ought to got no rea-son now for go-in' home
[VERSE 1:]
Once I had every rea-son a man could want
For go-in' home and mak-in' love, but now I don't
So I end up in here each night sit-tin' and a-think-in'
Miss-in' her, hurt-in' so and drink-in'
REPEAT CHORUS:
[VERSE 2:]
It's so hard now just know-in' there's an-oth-er
That she's out with him know-in' that I love her
So I end up in here each night sit-tin' and a-think-in'
Miss-in' her, hati-n' him and drink-in'Caravan of yellow wire
And crawling across the plains
Rolling along in a single file
Like a slow moving train
It rumbled down out of the mist
Into the early morning light
Said they stay till the job was
Finished if it took them till midnight
There were cats and scrapers
All caterpillars packed up by mile high crane
And it looked like monsters from the old
B movies the drive-ins use to play
And we'd sang goodbye Saturday
Under the stars, wake up little Suzy
In my daddy's car
So many memories, got lost and found
When a piece of history hit the ground
The day they tore the last drive-in down
Memories thick as the smoke clouds
They made man and machine became one
Boards snapped like toothpicks
On their blades but to us it sounded like guns
Cowboys soldiers gangsters and thieves
James Bond and his golden girls
Well you could sit in your car
And never turn the key and go
Half way around the world
And it stood like a landmark for forty years
We never thought we'd live to see
It fall it to the ground and then
Just disappear like so many childhood dreams
And we'd sang goodbye
A lot of the drivers had tears in their eyes
But I don't think it was just the dust
See I still believe there's a little piece
Of that old drive-in left in all of us
Nobody moved through what seemed like hours
And slow motion it came tumbling down
We just stood there with a taste of metal
In our mouths and a silence all around
The day they tore the last drive-in down
And we'd sang goodbyeI can't count the times we've sat and cried
Up all night, trying to work it out
But this feels different than it ever was
This is serious
Are we over now
Everything I've ever learned about love
Baby, I've learned it from us
Love can make you really believe
Love can knock you straight to your knees
Love can make you fight for the things you wanna hold
But sometimes, baby, love lets go
You're the only one who ever thought
That I was strong and I liked it
And I'm the only one you'd ever tell
When you needed help, like I did
I know it hurts you to do this to me
But baby, don't stay where you don't want to be
Love can make you really believe
Love can knock you straight to your knees
Love can make you fight for the things you wanna hold
But sometimes, baby, love lets go
Sometimes, baby, love lets go[ Both ]
Well it's all right it's all right long as I've got my Lord beside me well it's all right
Long as I've got his hand to hold long as he's a watchin' to warm my soul
Long as everything's in his control well it's all right
[ Connie ]
Moses said it's all right when chariots of payroll followed them in their flight
Well to see divided in two moses and the children walk right through
Through of wall of water on their left and on their right
[ Both ]
Well it's all right it's all right...
[ Nat ]
Then David said it's all right
When the life marked them many challenged them to a fight
Little David said a prayer and then slunk a little stone and done 'em in
And the people say they may embrace the almighty's might
[ Both ]
Well it's all right it's all right...
[ Connie ]
Daniel said it's all right when they threw him in the lion's den that awful night
While the hungry lion's walked about Daniel said Lord please help me out
And the Lord has shut the lion's mouth and he shut it tight
[ Both ]
Well it's all right it's all right...Hurt is no stranger to me
And oh how well I know misery
You've always hurt me
But I always forgive
And I'll hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live
Oh it's my fault for loving you so deeply
I'd give you my love completely
I'd give you love but hurt is all you give
And I hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live
For as long as I love you, there'll be pain
Though tears come and go
My love remains the same
I'll always forgive you
You know that I will
And I hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live
Yes I've hurt for as long as I loved you
And I'll love you for as long as I liveCause your love takes good care of me yes your love takes good care of me
And when the rain falls and the wind blows and the storm is on the sea
I'll be safe your love takes care of me
When life for me gets weary and the sun refuses to shine
I run to the arms of the one I love and there I'll hide
You know just what to do and say you make my life worthwhile
And when I look upon your face I see heaven in your smile
Cause your love takes good care of me...
I'll be safe your love takes care of meI'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone baby
It's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You said it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone baby
It's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more fucking love song I'll be sick
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone baby
It's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more fucking love song I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone...You didn't notice me right beside you
I said you looked like someone that I knew
A little lie to get you to talk to me awhile
You're eyes oh how they melt me
Your smile, girl heaven help me
Your lips kiss and tell me a thing or two
Oh, the happy ending this could be
Swept away in love and all it's glory
One minute hearts are lonely
The next each other's only
Then darlin', I just know we'd fall that fast
So don't you ever think it can't
Love happens just like that
I could try and act like I don't care
But, bein' shy that gets me nowhere
Though I admit, I'm a little bit scared to talk to you
A risk, yeah maybe
But it's one worth taking
'Cause I see a love in the making here with you
Oh, the happy ending this could be
Swept away in love and all it's glory
One minute hearts are lonely
The next each other's only
Then darlin', I just know we'd fall that fast
So don't you ever think it can't
Love happens just like
Lightning striking, flames igniting
In an instant, souls igniting
One minute hearts are lonely
Then the next each other's only
Then darlin' I just know we'd fall that fast
So don't you ever think it can't
Love happens just like
Don't you ever think it can't
Love happens just like that
It happens just like that
Love happens just like thatSometimes you may think I take you for granted
And granted, sometimes maybe I do
'Cause I've grown so used to you lying next to me
That I wouldn't want to live if you didn't love me
[Chorus]
No I wouldn't want to get up in the morning if you weren't there
To kiss me and start my day off right
And to be waiting when I get home with loving just for me
No I wouldn't want to live if you didn't love me
It's love that makes the world go round
And my love for you just grows with leaps and bounds
'Cause you know just what to do when the world has turned all blue
And I wouldn't want to live if you didn't love meLet's turn the lights down soft and low
And watch the fire embers glow
Let's lock the world outside the door
This is the night we've been waiting for
The moon is shining through the window pane
I hear the echo of a passing train
Taking someone's lover far away
But in your arms is where I wanna stay
Tonight I'm the luckiest man in the world
Wrapped in the arms of a beautiful girl
And now that I've found you
I'm never gonna let you go
Let your hair fall across your breast
Show me the warmth of your soft caress
The music's playin' soft and slow
We're driftin' into the afterglow
Tonight I'm the luckiest man in the world
Wrapped in the arms of a beautiful girl
And now that I've found you
I'm never gonna let you go
I'm never gonna let you go
I'm never gonna let you goSatan, Yer Kingdom Must Come Down
Satan yer kingdom must come down
Satan yer kingdom must come down
I heard the voice of Jesus say
Satan yer kingdom must come down
Shout til I tear your kingdom down
Shout til I tear your kingdom down
I heard the voice of Jesus say
Shout til I tear your kingdom downI bet you're kickin' yourself for lettin' me walk away
Makin' yourself a list of things you wish you didn't say
Sitting by the phone hoping it's gonna ring
Tell me you get lonely when it's cold outside
Tell me that you're only barely gettin' by
I need to know it hurts every time that you hear my name
It ain't the same without me, girl
Tell me you get lonely
Sometimes you're up all night cryin' over me
You've gotta take off of work to catch up on your sleep
But that just don't work, now does it, baby
So tell me you get lonely when it's cold outside
Tell me that you're only barely gettin' by
I need to know it hurts every time that you hear my name
It ain't the same without me, girl
Tell me you get lonely
Tell me you get lonely, and I'll come back
All you've gotta do is call me, my bag's been packed
I'm dyin' of pride, but I want you to know
That I get lonely when it's cold outside
Baby, I'm only barely gettin' by
And it still hurts every time that I hear your name
It ain't the same without you, girl
Baby, I get lonely, yeah, I get lonely
Tell me you get lonely too
Tell me you get lonelyThere are lots of hard times Christians living round us every day
Six days for earthly pleasure leaving one day off to pray
But they're standin' face to Saviour if it was a judgment day
Would they be ready if Jesus came today
Would you be ready if Jesus came today would you be ready to follow in his way
Would he take you by the hand or would he have you turn away
Would you be ready if Jesus came today
Well he tells us in the Bible just exactly what to do
You'd better read it brother it's meant for me and you
Better have your answer ready if today should be the day
Would you be ready if Jesus came today
Would you be readThree minute positive not too country
Up-tempo love song
This is a three minute song
To tell her that I love her
And how wonderful we get along
A sweet sentiment that's borderline stick
A lot of right and not much wrong
It's a little bit edgy, but softer than spaghetti
Weak yet redundantly strong
It's a three minute positive
Not too country up-tempo love song
[Chorus]
Yeah, it's a three minute positive
Not too country up-tempo love song
It's a way for me to tell her that I love her
But it can't be too long
There will be no drinkin' no cheatin'
No lyin' no leavin'that stuff it just don't belong
In a three minute positive
Not too country up-tempo love song
You won't hear four-letter words
Just me tellin' her
That she's the every breath I draw
And how I can't live without her
And I could never doubt her
'Cause she could never do no wrong
Well it's the right amount of timin' the proper form of rhymin' a little guitar
Then it's gone
It's a three minute positive
Not too country up-tempo love song
[Chorus]
Yeah in a three minute positive
Not too country up-tempo love song
There will be no drinkin' no cheatin'
No lyin' no leavin' that stuff it just don't belong
In a three minute positive
Not too country up-tempo love song
Yeah in a three minute positive
Not too country up-tempo love songI overlooked a love I couldn't see until that day you walked away from me
That's what it took for this poor fool to find
That your sweet love was right here all the time
When we broke up I started searchin' to
For our love hid from me as well as you
How could I be so foolish and so blind
When your true love was right here all the time
Right here was love when neither one expected it to be
Right here was love before our eyes that neither one could see
We'll let the world go by dear we won't mind
For our true love was right here all the time
[ guitar ]
Right here was love...Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die
Once upon a time there lived a man and his name was Isaac
He walked with God both day and night but he didn't wanna die
He cried, oh Lord, please let me live, death is close I know
God smiled down on Isaac and gave him fifteen years to go.
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die
Lord I wanna go to heaven but I don't wanna die
Well, I long for the day when I'll have new birth 'cause I love the livin' here on earth
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die.
When Jesus lived here on this earth he knew his father's plan
He knew that he must give his life to save the soul of men
When Judas had betrayed him his father heard him cry
He was brave until his death but he didn't wanna die hey.
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die
Lord I wanna go to heaven but I don't wanna die
Well, I long for the day when I'll have new birth 'cause I love the livin' here on earth
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die.Maybe tonight I'll get lucky
I've been lonely too long
Maybe tonight some dark stranger
Will hear me singing this song
I've been down, I've played around
I don't like it that way
Love, won't you treat me right?
Maybe tonight
Maybe this time I'll be saying
The words that I've wanted to say
Maybe this time I'll be staying
For more than just a day
I've been down, I've played around
I don't like it that way
Love, won't you treat me right?
Maybe tonight
I'm so tired of being free
Of living just for me
Oh love, won't you treat me right?
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight I'll get lucky
I've been lonely too long
Maybe tonight some dark stranger
Will hear me singing this song
I've been down, I've played around
I don't like it that way
Love, won't you treat me right?
Maybe tonight
Well, I'm so tired of being free
Of living just for me
Oh love, won't you treat me right?
Maybe tonight
Well, I'm so tired of being free
Of living just for me
Oh love, won't you treat me right?
Maybe tonight
Oh love, won't you treat me right?
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonightCowboys and outlaws, right guys and south-paws
Good dogs and all kinds of cats.
Dirt roads and white lined, and all kinds of stop signs
I'll stand right here where I'm at
Cause I wear my own kind of hat.
There's two kinds of lovers, two kinds of brothers
Two kinds of babies to hold.
There's two kinds of cherries, two kinds of fairies
Two kinds of mothers I'm told, I'm told
Cowboys and outlaws, right guys and south-paws
Good dogs and all kinds of cats.
Dirt roads and white lines and all kinds of stop signs
I'll stand right here where I'm at
Cause I wear my own kind of hat.
There's two kinds of brother, two kinds of lovers
Two kinds of babies to hold
There's two kinds of cherries, two kinds of fairies
Two kinds of mothers I'm told, I'm told(Walk out backwards and I'll think you're walking in)
I'd rather live a life of lies and fantasy
Than to face the truth and realize you're leaving me
You built me up so high my heart can't stand the fall
And life without your love just isn't life at all
So walk out backwards if you must go
And please don't wave goodbye just wave one last hello
The truth won't hurt so much if I can't just pretend
So walk out backwards and I'll think you're walking in
You walked into my heart in search of sympathy
And from that day down to this you've walked all over me
And now you're walking out to find somebody new
But you're not by yourself cause my heart's leaving too
Walk out backwards
Walk out backwards and I'll think you're walking inI love you and your tango dress
And going where the music says
I pray this love song never ends
?cause when we spin like this
I know where heaven is
Right here in the moment that we're in
Love happens when we get this close
Whatever you do don't let go
I want to be there
When you dance
When you laugh
When you cry
For the rest of our lives
I want to be there
In your arms
In your world
In your heart
Wherever you are
I want to be there
Every night's like New Year's Eve
Every day that you're here with me
Every touch is a cause for celebration
I want to be your birthday kiss
I want to be your every wish
I want to be your strongest temptation
Through all of the years that go by
You'll find me here by your side
I want to be there
When you dance
When you laugh
When you cry
For the rest of our lives
I want to be there
In your arms
In your world
In your heart
Wherever you are
I want to be thereLast night I thought I felt your arms around me
But woke to find that it was just a dream
Though you're gone I find you constantly surround me
Ohh, just something else that keeps your memory green
I go out and try my hand at startin' over
But find it hard to break the old routine
'Cause I wind up seein' you in each new lover
Ohh, just something else that keeps your memory green
Time should be a cure for a heartache
A healing melody for shattered dreams
But I swear sometimes I hear you say you love me
Ohh, just something else that keeps your memory green
Time should be a cure for a heartache
A healing melody for shattered dreams
Oh, but I swear sometimes I hear you say you love me
Ohh, just something else that keeps your memory green
Just something else that keeps your memory greenBack in 1953, we stole a car old Merle and me
Never thinking wed be put in jail
You might say that we were green, I was barely seventeen
When they put those bars between old Merle and me
Late one night we hit the wall, twenty feet we had to fall
To the ground where we could craw into the weeds
Waiting for that shotgun blast, never thinking we could last
We sure had to grow up fast, old Merle and me
We were young and crazy then, it was easy to pretend
Acting like wed never been in reform school
Looking danger in the eye, walking with our heads held high
We were not afraid to die, old Merle and me
We were living by the gun, never caring what wed done
Swearing it was all just fun and games you know
We would die and go to hell before we broke our vow to tell
How we escaped that prison cell, old Merle and meWhere did I go wrong
You know I've never had a clue
I must have just been born no good
'Cause bad's the best that I can do
Was it just my fate in life
To end up here this way
Lost and all alone
One more black lamb
That's gone astray
Lonesome roads are the only kind
I ever travel
Empty rooms are the only place
I ever stay
I'm just a face out in the crowd that looks
Like trouble
Poor ol' worthless me is the only friend
I ever made
Lonesome roads are the only kind
I ever travel
Empty rooms are the only place
I ever stay
I'm just a face out in the crowd that looks
Like trouble
Poor ol' worthless me is the only friend
I ever madeI am a Rose of Sharon
A lily of the valley
As a lily grows
Among the thorns
Love in this world
Has found me
As an apple tree
Among the trees
That grow deep in the forest
My lover's form is comely
With life and limb most joyous
Rise up my love and come away
the rain is over and gone
Your love is the fruit of my darkest day
And I am your Rose of Sharon
His gentle hand lies under my head
His shoulders turned to face me
I shall not stir him from my bed
While he doth so embrace me
Oh bring me wine to pass the time
Though none but him can soothe me
I am my beloved's
And he is mine
Desire for his pleasure moves me
Rise up my love and come away
the rain is over and gone
Your love is the fruit of my darkest day
And I am your Rose of SharonEverybody stops and stares at me
These two teeth are gone as you can see
I don't know just who to blame for this castastrophe
But my one wish on Christmas Eve is as plain as can be
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
See my two front teeth
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth
Then I could wish you, "Merry Christmas"
It seems so long since I could say
"Sister, Susie sitting on a thistle!"
Gosh, oh gee, how happy I'd be, if I could only whistle
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
See my two front teeth
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth
Then I could wish you, "Merry Christmas"
It seems so long since I could say
"Sister, Susie sitting on a thistle!"
Gosh, oh gee, how happy I'd be, if I could only whistle
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
See my two front teeth
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth
Then I could wish you, "Merry Christmas"I remember the summer I turned sixteen,
And that old jalopy Daddy gave to me,
It had holes in the floor and just a 305
But I didn't care 'cause I could finally drive.
There wasn't much to do in my home town,
So every weekend night, we would all go down
There were freaks and hippies in my high school;
Football players all tryin' to be cool.
And everybody scramblin' to hide their beer'
When the cops drove by till the coast was clear.
Kids fallin' in and out of love,
On the hoods of Chevys, in the beds of trucks
We were stumblin' our way through life 'til our senior year,
But man we sure did learn a lot in that Wal-Mart parking lot.
She had long blonde hair and sea-green eyes;
The most beautiful thing I'd ever seen in my life.
But I was young and dumb and didn't have a line,
And all I could say was can i call 'ya sometime?
She just said no and walked away,
But she just said no and walked away,
And that was the first time I felt my heart break.
There were freaks and hippies in my high school;
Football players all tryin' to be cool.
And everybody scramblin' to hide their beer'
When the cops drove by till the coast was clear.
Yeah, we all did alot of livin'.
It was small-town teenage heaven.
There were freaks and hippies in my high school;
Football players all tryin' to be cool.
And everybody scramblin' to hide their beer'
When the cops drove by till the coast was clear.
Well, I had my first kiss, my first love,
Got my ass kicked but I got back up.
Lost my way, found it again,
Had one long buzz and a dozen best friends
In that Wal-Mart parking lot.
In that Wal-Mart parking lot.Heah hah hah!

Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]He sends her roses and lines he composes
Things a lady loves
Well he's there to hold her when she needs a shoulder
If life gets too rough
Oh now that she's left I keep kickin' myself
Whenever I start thinkin' back
He says he needs her, tells her he loves her
Why didn't I think of that
When she gets down well he's always around and
He makes her smile again
He mends her heartaches, remembers her birthday
And tries to be a friend
Now that she's gone I know ah I did her wrong
It's all so simple and fact
He says he wants her, can't live without her
Why didn't I think of that
Ooooooh I've been watchin'
Every move he makes
Ooooooh I've been thinkin'
It could&'ve been different somehow
If I'd known what I know now
He sings her love songs, and tells her his love's strong
Things she needs to know
He tries to please her, and calls for no reason
Just to say hello
He says he loves her and he'll never leave her
And I never will get her back
I did my best, thought of everything else
Why didn't I think of that
Oooooooh I been watchin'
Every move that he makes
Oooooooh I been thinkin'
Oh it could've been different somehow
If I'd known what I know now
He sends her roses, and lines he composes
Things a lady loves
He's there to hold her when she needs a shoulder
If life gets too rough
Oh now that she's left I keep kickin' myself
Whenever I start thinkin' back
He says he needs her, tells her he loves her
Why didn't I think of that
He says he loves her and he'll never leave her
Why didn't I think of thatWill the roses bloom where she lies sleeping
Will the flowers shed their pedals there
Will the dewdrops fall upon the roses
Where my darling sleeps beneath the sand
Her lips were like a bunch of roses
Her eyes were like the starlit sky
Her hair was dark and it was curly
I'll miss her till the day I die
I miss my darling she is sleeping
Underneath the beautiful sky
I miss her now since she has left me
I will miss her til the day I dieI was a sailboat
I was a sailor
I was a son of a gun of a gun
I made it happen
Down in the schoolyard
I was a firecracker exploding
Hallelujah! The sparks flew up to heaven
They saw my smile
And I was laughin' so hard
Hallelujah! The sparks flew up to heaven
And I left the sober people
With their cold hearts
Sometimes there is someone
Someone who knows you
But when you are sad
There is no one
But I'm a red bicycle
Rollin' and rollin'
I'm quicksilver, I'm a dealmaker
Don't you cross me once
Hallelujah! The sparks flew up to heaven
They saw my smile
And I was laughin' so hard
Hallelujah! The sparks flew up to heaven
And I left the sober people
With their cold hearts
Nothin' can hold me
To this earth that don't roll me
And I don't know
If I'm dirty or clean
Well I was a sailboat
I was a sailor
And I was a firecracker exploding
And o! why do you cry,
Sister, cry?
I've been talkin' with angels and it's gonna be fine
Hallelujah! The sparks flew up to heaven
And I left the sober people
With their cold heartsYou know where I might be
Any given Saturday night
You know what dress to wear
How to make it look just right
When you walk by
How to smile like you just don't care
You know what drink I like
You know which songs I love
When you hit that dance floor
You know how to mess me up
How to make me love ya
No, girl, it just ain't fair
You've got my number
Yeah, baby, you know me
You've got me wonderin'
How good that end might be
If I could kiss you
Spend a little time with you, girl
You love to drive me
A hundred miles right out of my mind
You love to make me
Think what it might be like
If I could hold ya
But, no, you're just a tease
You've got my number
But you ain't callin' me
I know you remember
We shared that dance one night
Yeah, we got so close
Underneath that neon light
Then, it was over
You said you had to go
But I made you hold up
Put my number in your phone
I thought you'd hit me up
Later, when you got back home
But I never heard from you
And I'm still hangin' on
You've got my number
Yeah, baby, you know me
You've got me wonderin'
How good that end might be
If I could kiss you
Spend a little time with you, girl
You love to drive me
A hundred miles right out of my mind
You love to make me
Think what it might be like
If I could hold ya
But, no, you're just a tease
You've got my number
But you ain't callin' me

And girl it ain't right
You push my buttons
And act like it ain't nothin', baby

You've got me wonderin'
How good that end might be
If I could kiss you
Spend a little time with you, girl

A hundred miles right out of my mind
You love to make me
Think what it might be like
If I could hold ya
But, no, you're just a tease
You've got my number
But you ain't callin' me
Yeah, you've got me fallin'
But, girl, you ain't callin'
Ain't callin' meeDeep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San AntoneWhen I get where I'm going
On the far side of the sky
The first thing that I'm gonna do
Is spread my wings and fly
I'm gonna land beside a lion
And run my fingers through his mane
Or I might find out what it's like
To ride a drop of rain
Yeah, when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah, when I get where I'm going
Don't cry for me down here
I'm gonna walk with my grandaddy
And he'll match me step for step
And I'll tell him how I missed him
Every minute since he left
Then I'll hug his neck
Yeah, when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah, when I get where I'm going
Don't cry for me down hereAs I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the starry crown
Good Lord, show me the way!
O sisters, let's go down,
Let's go down, come on down
O sisters, let's go down
Down in the river to pray
As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the robe and crown
Good Lord, show me the way!
O brothers, let's go down
Let's go down, come on down
Come on, brothers, let's go down
Down in the river to pray
As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the starry crown
Good Lord, show me the way!
O fathers, let's go down
Let's go down, come on down
O fathers, let's go down
Down in the river to pray
As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the robe and crown
Good Lord, show me the way!
O mothers, let's go down
Let's go down; don't you want to go down?
Come on, mothers, let's go down
Down in the river to pray
As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the starry crown
Good Lord, show me the way!
O sinners, let's go down
Let's go down, come on down
O sinners, let's go down
Down in the river to pray
As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the robe and crown
Good Lord, show me the way!It's a long trip alone over sand and stone
That lie along the road that we all must travel down
So maybe you could walk with me a while
And maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Everybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to hold
'Cause it's a long trip alone
It's a short piece of time but just enough to find
A little peace of mind under the sun somewhere
So maybe you could walk with me a while
And maybe I could rest beneath your smile
You know we can't afford to let one moment pass us by
'Cause it's a short piece of time
And I don't know where I'd be without you here
'Cause I'm not really me without you there
Yeah, yeah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, oh
So maybe you could walk with me a while
Maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Everybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to hold
So maybe you could walk with me a while
Maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Maybe I could feel right beside you till I'm home
'Cause it's a long trip alone, a long trip aloneWhat if I told you about my little nothing town
The two room house where I came from
The man that I got my name from
I don't even know where he is now
What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you there is no fixing me
'Cause everybody has already tried
Would you stay?
Would you leave?
I could wait
It'll all come out eventually
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I've blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way?
Could you love me anyway?
What if I told you I don't plan on staying here
My dreams are a million miles away
And I know your family is gonna want you to stay
You know what I don't blame 'em
So I'll say
What I don't want to
And I'll just pray
You want what I do
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I've blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way?
Could you love me anyway?
Aww, could you love me anyway?
So before we go any further here
Let a week turn into another year
There some things you probably don't wanna hear
But you have to
If I told you sometimes I get jealous
Sometimes I'm half crazy
Would you say the hell with me, the hell with me
If I told you I barely know what love is
But girl if that's what this is
I don't want to let it slip away
No, no, no
Could you love me anyway?
Please
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway? Oh
Could you love me anyway?I'm a runner that's what I do
Don't be surprised when I run from you
When you turn around I'll be gone.
I won't leave cause of something you said
Nobody will know which way that I went
Beat ya to the door before you get the chance
It ain't the falling in love I'm scared of
It ain't the moonlight shining in your eyes
It ain't the falling baby cause the fallin' I've always liked
I'm good at being lonely, lonely's all I got
It ain't the fallin' in love that'll kill me, it's the sudden stop.
Love me now we can't waste time
I'm not the kind who likes to stay all night
Once the sun comes up there's too much at stake
Never wanted a one night stand
A broken heart can really change a man
You're the kind of girl who really hurt me bad.
It ain't the falling in love I'm scared of
It ain't the moonlight shining in your eyes
It ain't the falling baby cause the fallin' I've always liked
I'm good at being lonely, lonely's all I got
It ain't the fallin' in love that'll kill me, it's the sudden stop.
I can't afford to fall again,
Cause if you leave, yeah you know nobody wins.
It ain't the falling in love I'm scared of
It ain't the moonlight shining in your eyes
It ain't the falling baby cause the fallin' I've always liked
I'm good at being lonely, lonely's all I got
It ain't the fallin' in love that'll kill me, it's the sudden stop.Big Jimmy Baker and Marty Gray met at a teenage party
Jimmy took Marty to school the next day both of them were tardy
Sittin' in the parking lot talking over things, waitin' for the morning bell to ring
Two little love birds loose on wing Jimmy Baker and Marty
Kids in love now what can you do but listen to the cooing
Pretty little blonde haired Marty Gray does your mama know
What you're doing? Bet your mama don't know what you're doing
Big Jimmy Baker's on the football team Marty's wearin' his sweater
Listen to them talking in the locker room man he's a real go getter
Telling Marty bout the facts of life says there'll never be another
Someday she's gonna be his wife he learned that line from his brother
Kids in love now what can you do but listen to the cooing
Pretty little blonde haired Marty Gray does your mama know
What you're doing? Bet your mama don't know what you're doing
Down at the drive-in Friday night didn't come to see the movie
Parked in back and away from the light Jimmy says isn't this groovy
Under the seat a bottle in a bag made to affect the senses
Poured out a drink for Marty Gray broke down her defense
Kids in love now what can you do but listen to the cooing
Pretty little blonde haired Marty Gray does your mama know
What you're doing? Bet your mama don't know what you're doing
Big Jimmy Baker and Marty Gray no longer goin' together
Fire of love burned out they say Marty's feelin' under the weather
Town turns out to have a big day the football hero's goin' away
But Marty's got the price to pay and Jimmy's gonna let her
Kids in love now what can you do but listen to the cooing
Pretty little blonde haired Marty Gray does your mama know
What you're doing? Bet your mama don't know what you're doing
Bet your mama don't know what you're doingI thought it was over
I thought I could move on
But I was wrong
I woke up last night
Calling your name
Feeling the blame baby
Thought I could quit you but
I still miss your love
What was I thinking
Thinking that I could still
Walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me
Girl I shoulda known it
I couldn't last a moment without you
You've got every right
To turn and walk away
I can't make you stay
I broke your heart
I wasted so much precious time baby
I see you with your friends
Wearing a smile again
What was I thinking
Thinking that I could still
Walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me
Girl I shoulda known it
I couldn't last a moment without you
Thought I could quit you
But I still miss your love
What was I thinking
Thinking that I could still
Walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one nightBy: David Allan Coe and Ann McGowan
SEE THOSE TUMBLEWEEDS A-BLOWING'
LORD, IT MAKES ME WANT TO CRY
IT REMINDS ME OF MY DADDY
AND THAT TEXAS LULLABY
SEE THOSE CACTUS FLOWERS BLOOMING'
LIKE THE TWINKLE IN HIS EYE
EVERY TIME HE STARTED SINGING' THAT OLE TEXAS LULLABY
YIPPEE YI LITTLE DOGGIE ROLL ALONG ROLL ALONG
YIPPEE YI LITTLE DOGGIE TAKE ME HOME, TAKE ME HOME
IT'S SO COLD ON THE DESERT, I'M CHILLED TO THE BONE
YIPPEE YI LITTLE DOGGIE, YIPPEE YI
LOOK YONDER THERE'S A DUST CLOUD PAINTING PICTURES IN THE SKY
DADDY TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT, IN THAT TEXAS LULLABY
THEM OLE LONGHORNS ARE A BALLWIN', LORD I KNOW I MUST BE HIGH
WISH MY DAD COULD HEAR ME SINGING' THIS OLD TEXAS LULLABY
DADDY LEFT ME THIS OLD GUITAR, THOUGH I NEVER QUITE KNEW WHY
HE SAID SOMEDAY I'D BE FAMOUS LIKE THAT TEXAS LULLABY
BUT IT'S BEEN A MONTH OF SUNDAYS SINCE I SEEN THAT EDGE FLY
AND NOBODY WANTS TO LISTEN TO A TEXAS LULLABYIf time has no end and if time has no end
A billion years a trillion years what then is infinity
A circle an eternal loop
It can drive you crazy searching for the truth
Someday will we know all about it
Have no reason to doubt it
Someday
Before we were babies
There's nothing we recall and when we go back
Will it fade to black and that's all
Or could we be destined for some other time and place
And have we lived other lives our memories have erased
Someday will we know all about it
Have no reason to doubt it
Someday
Will we see Jesus comin' as the sunshine fills the night
Or when we die will we fly into the light
Will we all be reunited with the ones who've gone away
And will we love each other the way we do today I believe
Someday we'll know all about it
Have no reason to doubt it
SomedayI come from just the other side of nowhere to this big time lonesome town
They got a lotta ice and snow here half as cold as all the people I found
Every way I've tried to go here seems to bring me down
And I seen about enough to know where I belong
I've got a mind to see the headlight
Shinin' on that old white line between my heart and home
Sick of spendin' Sundays wishing they were Mondays sittin' in a park alone
So give my best to anyone who's left who's ever done me any lovin' way but wrong
And tell 'em that the pride of just the other side of nowhere's going home
Taking nothing back to show there for these dues that I've paid
But the soul I almost sold here and the body I've been given away
Fadin' from the neon night time glow here headin' for the light of day
Just the other side of nowhere's going home
I've got a mind to see the headlightIt's just an old beat up truck,
Some say that I should trade up
Now that I got some jangle in my pocket
But what they don't understand
Is it's the miles that make a man
I wouldn't trade that thing in for a rocket
What they don't know is my dad and me
We drove her out to Tennessee
And she's still here and now he's gone
So I hold on
It's just an old beat up box,
Its rusty strings across the top
It probably don't look like much to you
But these dents and scratches in the wood,
Yeah, that's what makes it sound so good
To me it's better than brand new
You see this here flat top guitar,
Has had my back in a million bars
Singing every country song
So I hold on
To the things I believe in
My faith, your love, our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
Yeah, I hold on, I hold on
Like the stripes to the flag,
Like a boy to his dad
I can't change who I am, right or wrong
So I hold on
Yeah, baby, looking at you right now,
There ain't never been no doubt
Without you I'd be nothing
So if you ever worry about
Me walking out
Yeah, let me tell you something
I hold on
I hold on
Can you hear me, baby?
I hold on
Yea,
I hold on
To the things I believe in
My faith, your love, our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
To the things I believe in
My faith, your love, our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
Yeah, I hold on
I hold on
I hold on and on and on and on and on
I hold on and on and on and on and onI've seen her smile in the morning light
It would take my breath away
I'd hold her close and hold her tight
Hopin' she'd let me stay
Inside her heart forever
And let me be
The air she breaths, the song I sing
Her destiny, what tomorrow brings
I'd give to her all I have
My heart and soul would be
Her everything
Each night I pray to the lord above
Hopin' she'll never leave
And I can't help but wonder why
She gives this love to me
And when we're old and gray
Will I still be
The air she breaths, the song I sing
Her destiny, what tomorrow brings
I'd give to her all I have
My heart and soul will be
Her everything
She must be an angel
To change my life this way
'Cause all I want to be to her
Is what she is to me
The air she breaths, the song I sing
Her destiny, what tomorrow brings
I'd give to her all I have
My heart and soul will be
Her everything
I'd give to her all I have
My heart and soul will be
Her everythingPapa writes to Johnny
But Johnny can't come home
Been too much time now
Too many nights on the road
Oh, too many nights on the road
Blues on the table
There's blues every week
Pouring out of the coffee pot
With the first cup of the day
Oh, the first cup of the day
Now where are my friends
When I'm taking the heat
Only help I got today
Was from a stranger on the street
Oh, a stranger on the street
And why would you laugh
If you wanted to cry
And why would you say things
If you knew it was a lie
Oh, you knew it was a lie
Dark was the night
Cold was the ground
I couldn't sleep
So I got up and walked around
Oh, I got up and walked around
And I walked into Dallas
Crying all the way
Running over in my mind
Everything I meant to say
Oh, everything I meant to say
Papa writes to Johnny
But Johnny can't come home
Been too much time now
Too many nights on the road
Oh, too many nights on the roadjust to see my holly home
evil jack he walks alone
swings a club and stinks something awful
well give him a painful jawful
sara walks a slinky strut
very gorgeous and anxious slut
has a love scar on her wrist
well give her our painful fist
just to see my holly home
just to see my holly home
we will live just us alone
safely in our holly home
in come babies one, two, three
like to bounce them on our knee
want to stay and grow up with us
baby stew will surely fill us
just to see my holly home
just to see my holly home
we will live just us alone
safely in our holly home
pound them down, pound them out
older ladies scream and shout
hide their bodies in the reeds
shallow bed of soil and leaves
out will grow ideas and laughter
up will rise our earthly daughter
water floods and all upon it
up upon our bloody planet
now weve ended all whod harm us
no one left here to alarm us
and we live just us alone
safely in our holly home
just to see my holly home
just to see my holly home
we will live just us alone
safely in our holly homeAnother party's over another night with friends
Their laughter's cold and left alone and now my mem'ries begin
I beg of you my darling and pass the hours away
These mem'ries of mine like reddest wine
Grow stronger with each passing day
Ours was a special love and once in a lifetime love
That's what I'd rather dream of
The past with you than search for someone new
Life without you is empty like the seasons without the fall
But I'd rather have loved and lost you than never have loved you at all
But I'd rather have loved and lost you than never have loved you at allMoody River more deadly than the vainest knife
Moody River your muddy water took my baby's life
Last Saturday evening I came to the old oak tree
That stands beside the river where you were to meet me
On the ground your glove I found with a note addressed to me
It read dear love I've done you wrong now I must set you free
No longer can I live with this hurt and this sin
I just couldn't tell you that guy was just a friend
[ piano ]
Moody River more deadly...
I looked into the muddy water and what could I see
I saw a lonely lonely face just looking back at me
Tears in his eyes and the prayer on his lips
And the glove of his lost love at his fingertips
[ piano ]
Moody River more deadly...O LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM
Writers Reverend Phillips Brooks, Lewis H. Redner
O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie. Above the deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by. Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light; The hopes and fears of all the years are met in Thee tonight. For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above, While mortals sleep, the angels keep their watch of wondering love. O morning stars, together proclaim the holy birth. And praises sing to God the King, and peace to men on earth. How silently, how silently, the wondrous Gift is giv'n. So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of his heav'n. No ear may hear His coming, but in this world of sin, Where meek souls will receive Him still, the dear Christ enters in. O holy Child of Bethlehem, descend to us we pray. Cast out our sin and enter in, be born in us today. We hear the Christmas angels the great glad tidings tell; O come to us, abide with us, our Lord Emanuel.For just one chance to find
Love was someone that you loved to find
For just the sense to try
To walk ahead and leave the pain behind
If the days aren't easy and the nights are rough
When they ask you what you're thinking of
Say love, say for me love
Say love, say for me love
Your heart says not again
What kind of mess have you got me in
But when the feelings there
It can lift you up and take you anywhere
But the gravel beneath you and the limbs above
If anybody asks you where your coming from
Say love, say for me love
Say love, say for me love
Say yes we live uncertainty
And disappointments have to be
And everyday we might be facing more
And yes we live in desperate times
But fading words and shaking rhymes
There's only one thing here worth hoping for
With Lucifer beneath you and God above
If either one of them asks you what your living of
Say love, say for me love
Say love, say for me love
Say love, say for me love
Say love, say for me love
Say love, say for me love
Say love, say for me loveYou make my heart beat too fast
You make me want this to last
You make me spend all my money
Oh I think I love you honey
You make me think I could miss you
You make me think I should kiss you
You make me want your affection
We need to make a connection
You're so angelic
I'm psychedelic with emotion
And I can't come down
Well my heart was playing dead
But love changes everything around
I wanna ride in your car
I wanna know where you are
Why don't you make me your fool
Come on baby take me to school
You make me want to be sweet
You make me walk down your street
You make me dance to your beat
I'm gonna save you a seat
You're making me lose my focus
You've got some bad hocus pocus
You make me think you're clever
I'm gonna love you foreverAll this time I've searched for you
Down every road I've travelled
I wove a thousand fantasies
But each one came unravelled
You've haunted places in my mind
Where no one else has been
And now our paths have led us
To a love that has no end
Anywhere with you
Is where I want to be
Anywhere will do
As long as you're with me
Your love has brought me happiness
That time cannot undo
And paradise will fill my life
Anywhere with you
The dream that filled my lonely nights
Is finally unfoldin'
And given me someone to share
The love that my heart's holdin'
As years turn into memories
Our love will still remain
Till the moment passes forever
My heart will call your name
Anywhere with you
Is where I want to be
Anywhere will do
As long as you're with me
Your love has brought me happiness
That time cannot undo
And paradise will fill my life
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Is where I want to be
Anywhere will do
As long as you're with me
Your love has brought me happiness
That time cannot undo
And paradise will fill my life
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with youBitter Side Of Sweet
(Clint Black/Hayden Nicholas)
She asked me how love gets along with me all by myself.
Wonders how I keep from getting dust upon that shelf.
She wanted to know how a man like me ends up alone, anyway.
'Was I breakin' all the rules of love and the games that people play.
I said not too many hangin' round of all the ones I meet.
In time they always find that I'm on the bitter side of sweet.
She huddled on the gate on my block where I always catch my bus.
An' I hoped it wouldn't stop today, there'd just be the two of us.
But it showed up like it always does, about twenty minutes late.
I told her it'd right along but she said she couldn't wait.
She didn't need any assistance in putting some distance, between us on that
empty street.
She was of a mind, in record time that I'm on the bitter side of sweet.
That I act this was is really no my fault.
It just means all the sweet things I got to say,
Come along with a grain of salt.Tonight I'm all alone no place to call my own
Don't have no one to love me anymore
I'm gonna pack up my grip and take a long long trip
Back to the one that I love so
Oh I long to go back to my darling
Back to the one I love so well
I know she'll be my wife and we'll settle down for life
Cause she's the one that means the world to me
I can't forget the day I left and went away
You told you me I'd be sorry some old day
I found it to be true so I'm heading back to you
Sweetheart I'm tired and I want to settle down
When I get back to her my rambling days are over
We'll build a little cottage on the hill
We'll think of days gone by sweetheart just you and I
And there we'll live so happy ever moreI got a buddy named Stacy Fay
He's been known to stay up for days
Pulls the shades and locks himself in the house
Sits in his room with his hand on his mouse
His phone's been busy now for over a week
So I dropped by to see what in Sam Hell is going on
And here's what he said to me:
Come on in and let's burn one Cledus
No need to go to the record store
I've got every song that you're looking for
On my PC
And they're all free
Just click and download you some MP3s Presto you can make your own CDs
I'll show you how it's done
Fire up the computer and let's burn one
Before my eyes could not believe my ears
Every song ever sung in the last fifty years
He made me Conway Twitty's greatest hits
And threw in the Flock Of Seagulls for the flock of it
Time sure flies when you're burning one
It was three A. M. when I got home
My wife was mad at me
Till I gave her that CD
With a mix of her favorite songs
And I said
Lemme show ya how to burn one baby
No need to go to the record store
I found every song you're looking for on the PC
Even got me
No you won't ever find me downloading porn
Just Haggard and Jones, Limp Bizkit and Korn
And I could use some Brooks and Dunn
So Fire up the computer and let's burn one
Country jazz rap and pop
A lotta Bocephus and a little Kid Rock
And like Toby says "Get'chya some
Fire up the computer and let's burn one
I don't know if it's wrong I ain't saying it's right
But I'd sure love to hear some Metallica tonight
And I'm a little low on funds
So fire up the computer and let's burn one
Fire It upThe streets are dark and empty and you walk them all alone
You think about your love affair and wonder what went wrong
You go to bed each night and pray you'll never see the dawn
Afraid of each tomorrow with its heartless cold unknown
And that's what it's like to be lonesome without your love it's such an empty world
And that's what it's like to be lonesome I know cause I'm a mighty lonesome girl
You search to find a tavern where the music's playing loud
You try to lose your heartache in the laughter of the crowd
But the happy couples make you think of things that might have been
And you have to fight the teardrops 'till you're by yourself again
And that's what it's likeWhere did the sunshine go why is it raining so
Where is the love I used to know where did the sunshine go
Where did the sunshine go why do the cold winds blow
Where is the one I needed so where did the sunshine go
I discovered the sunshine in my darling's loving smile
Like a fool I thought the sun had come to stay
Then she fell for another and the sun went out of style
And the springtime vanished when she went away
Where did the sunshine go
Where did the sunshine go
Where did the sunshine goIt was the third of June, another sleepy dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was bailin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And mama hollered at the backdoor, "You all remember to wipe your feet"
And then she said, "I got some news this morning from Choctaw Wridge
Today Billie Joe Macallister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge"
Papa said to mama as he passed around the black eyed peas
"Billie Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits please"
"There's five more acres in the lower forty I got to plow"
And mama said, "It was a shame about Billie Joe anyhow
Seems like nothing ever comes to no good upon Choctaw Wridge
Now Billie Joe Macallister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge"
Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Caroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
I'll have another piece of apple pie, you know it just don't seem right
I saw him at sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Wridge
Now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
Mama said to me, "Child what's happened to your appetite?"
I've been cooking all morning and you haven't touched a single bite
And nice young preacher brother Tailor dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
Said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you upon Choctaw Wridge
She and Billie Joe was throwin' something off the Tallahatchie Bridge
Year's come and gone since we heard the news about Billie Joe
Brother married Becky Thompson and they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus goin' 'round, papa caught it and he died last spring
Now mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything
And me I spent a lot of time pickin' flowers upon Choctaw Wridge
And dropped 'em into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie BridgeI ain't gonna work on the railroad
I ain't gonna work on the farm
I'll lay around the shack till the mail train comes
Back
I'm rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
Gonna lay around the shack till the mail train comes
Back
I'm rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
Now where was you last Friday night while I was lyin'
In jail
Walkin' the streets with another man you wouldn't even
Go my bail
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms...
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
Gonna lay around the shack till the mail train comes
Back
I'm rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
Sister's a beauty operator
Mamma can weave and can spin
Dad owns an interest in that old cotton mill
Ought to watch that old cotton rolls in
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
Gonna lay around the shack till the mail train comes
Back
I'm rollin' in my sweet baby's armsBlue lonely winter blue lonely nights so long
Blue snowflakes falling and the blue lonely winter alone
Where are the flowers the sun and the moon
He must have taken them cause they're gone
And he left me right here in the middle
Of a blue lonely winter alone
Blue lonely winter...
[ guitar - steel ]
Blue snowflakes falling and the blue lonely winter aloneMaybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
That I am so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mindPass me not oh gentle Saviour hear my humble cry
While all others now are calling do not pass me by
Saviour Saviour hear my humble cry
While all others now are calling do not pass me by
Trusting only in Thy merit would I seek Thy face
Heal my wounded broken spirit save me by Thy grace
Saviour Saviour( Edith Frost EP )
My god insane
He makes me say
The strangest things
The meanest things
My god is blind
He asked me not
To see these things
To just believe in him
So occluded we
Choose not to see
What it means
And we'll fail to ask
Where we standI'll meet you in the morning by the bright riverside
When all sorrow has drifted away
I'll be standin' at the portals when the gates open wide
At the close of life's long weary day
I'll meet you in the morning with a 'How do you do?'
And we'll sit down by the river and when rapture of the plane is renewed
You'll know me in the morning by the smile that I wear
When I meet you in the morning, in the city that is built four square
I will meet you in the morning in the sweet by and by
And exchange the old cross for a crown
There will be no disappointments and nobody shall die
In that land when life's sun goeth down
I'll meet you in the morning with a 'How do you do?'
And we'll sit down by the river and when rapture of the plane is renewed
You'll know me in the morning by the smile that I wear
When I meet you in the morning in the city that is built four squareMOMMY PLEASE SAY HOME WITH ME
Writers Eddy Arnold, Wally Fowler, Graydon J. Hall
A mother went out on a party She left at home her baby son He cried and begged her not to leave him But she would not give up her fun. She kissed his cheek and tried to soothe him But would not heed his childish plea She heard him call as she was leavin' "Please mommy, please stay home with me." The mother joined the merrymakers And soon was lost in trifling joy The mellow tunes and flitting shadows Made her forget her baby boy. She danced and laughed and did some drinkin' The world for her was full of glee But now and then these words would haunt her "Please mommy, please stay home with me." She left the party feeling dizzy The smell of drinking on her breath She hurried home to find her baby In raging pain and nearing death. The doctor came and looked on sadly The case was hopeless, he could see The baby died, these words repeating "Please mommy, please stay home with me." The mother now, her life would forfeit To hear her baby's voice again She grieved to think she rudely left him To satisfy her wicked vain. Now mothers don't neglect your duty This story should a lesson be Do not ignore your baby's pleading "Please mommy, please stay home with me."Got There First
(CDJ/Mary Danna)
I can't find a smile underneath the pain
Since you've been gone, there's been nothing but rain
I didn't want to be left behind
I know I'll see you someday
But it's hard to wait
And I know I'll have this heartache
That won't go away
Yeah it hurts
But I know
That you just got there first
I never thought we would run outta time
We were just getting going, we were starting to fly
So many things left undone
Repeat Chorus
I know you're waiting on the other side
I guess I'll get there when the time is right
Repeat ChorusYoung lovers in a picture frame
Ever notice how there ain't no rain
Nobody hangs hard times on the wall
You won't see it in an 8 by 10
But there's a storm every now and then
A slamming door down the hall
Sometimes love is a white flag
Sometimes love is standing tall
Sometimes love is a feather
Sometimes a cannon ball
But it's worth fighting for (it's worth fighting for)
Baby, sometimes love is war
An old couple on a front porch swing
On a walk down memory lane
Been through the fire and back again
Through the clear and the cloudy skies
Still love in each other's eyes
Sometimes love is war but sometimes you win
Sometimes love is a white flag
Sometimes love is standing tall
Sometimes love is a feather
Sometimes a cannon ball
And it's worth fighting for (yeah, it's worth fighting for)
Baby, sometimes love is war
Sometimes love is all that can save us
Sometimes love can kill a man
Yeah sometimes love is a soft touch
Or a pistol in your hand
Sometimes love is a white flag
Sometimes love is standing tall
Sometimes love is a feather
Sometimes a cannon ball
But it's worth fighting for (it's worth fighting for)
Baby, sometimes love is
Baby, sometimes love is warThe nights were dark and long
I spent a million all alone
But I never once stopped loving you
My world was cold and still
My dreams lay unfulfilled
But I never once stopped loving you
[Chorus:]
I never once stopped believing we'd love again
The way we used to do
And today when you came back my patience was rewarded
For I never once stopped loving you
I could have loved another
But I chose the way and suffered
For I never once stopped loving you
And I prayed to God to guide you
Till I could be beside you
And I never once stopped loving you
[Chorus:](Dolly Parton)
Oh look at you boy, look at them jeans
Cutest little buttfull I've ever seen
I'd like to find you under my tree
Whatcha tryin' to do to me, huh?
Hey look at them boots, look at that hat
You can get in big trouble lookin' like that
Flirtin' like mad, talkin' that trash
You could make a good girl go bad real fast
Chorus:
Whatcha tryin' to do
Whatcha tryin' to do
Whatcha tryin' to do anyhow
I ain't made of steel but if looks could kill
Well I'd 've been dead by now
Tell me whatcha tryin to do to me
Look at that smile, look at them eyes
All lit up like Christmas lights
When you land on my roof tonight
Well here's what you better be
Well you'd better be fit, you'd better be prime
Cause I'm gonna ring your Christmas chime
When you climb down my chimney
Do whatcha you know only you can do to me
Repeat Chorus
I said ooh, what a thrill but if looks could kill
Well I'd 've been dead by now
Tell me whatcha tryin' to do
Whatcha tryin' to do
Whatcha tryin' to do to meWell today I started loving you again
And I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again
What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I've cried
Well I should have known the worst was yet to come
And that crying time for me had just begun
Cause today I started loving you againYou disappear a day or so
I have no idea where you go
Then out of the blue you cross my mind
It's me and you just like old times
Walking in the autumn breeze
Kickin' up the fallen leaves
I close my eyes, and you're right here
Sayin' this is my favorite time of year
Whenever you come back to me
I run to meet your memory
Let it take me back to yesterday
Down a country road that winds
Through golden leaves and better times
To a place where my heart longs to be
Whenever you come back to me
Even though I know you're gone
I read your name written on the stone
In my dreams there's a river wide
Where we walk side by side
We leave foot prints in the sand
You let go of my hand
At the waters edge you turn and smile
Say I'll see you in a little while
When ever you come back to me
I run to meet your memory
Let it take me back to yesterday
Down a country road that winds
Through golden leaves and better times
To a place where my heart longs to be
Whenever you come back to meLook under his floorboards, Mama,
I don't trust his silly grin
He's got a beat-up Rambler, Nebraska plates,
And I ain't getting in
I don't like the way his pinky ring
Picks up the dashboard light
Or his short little piggy fingers
Or the way his belt is cinched too tight
Check under his floorboards, Mama,
I don't like his suggestive tone
The way his words drip from his mouth
As he asks can I take you home?
I don't care how many miles I got,
I think I'd rather walk them alone
Than to sit in the back seat
As his eyes in the mirror
Reduce me to flesh and bone
Check under his floorboards, Mama,
'cause that razor's not just a threat to me
He'll be slicing tiny crescents from your heart,
Without laying a sweaty palm to your cheek
Don't accuse me of running scared,
Listen to what I'm saying
It's a fucked up ol' world, but this ol' girl
Well, she ain't giving inSome where up there beyond the blue
Surely by now somebody's missin' you
I found the angel they must be lookin' for
Heaven must be wondering where you are
When I look into your eye's
It's so plain to see
Nothin' here on earth describes what you mean to me
Out of this world when I hold you in my arms
Heaven must be wondering where you are
Lucky me to be the one to find
Someone like you this side of paradise
I know how lost I'd be without here sweetheart
Heaven must be wondering where you are
Some where up there beyond the blue
Surely by now somebody's missin' you
I found the angel they must be lookin' for
Heaven must be wondering where you areDaily grind is stealing me away again
When I just want to lay back down
Another night gone and don't know where it went
What I need more than anything right now
Is time with you more time with you
To laugh and talk and play and make more love to you
Ah there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Then spend time with you
Seven days you and me in paradise
The world revolving around us
We'd still be there and forever if the choice was mine
'Cause seven days that's not enough
Is time with you more time with you
To laugh and talk and play and make more love to you
Ah there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Then spend time with you
Time with you
I'm gone for now to do the things I have to do
But baby you know I live
For time with you more time with you
To laugh and talk and play and make more love to you
Ah there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Then spend time with you
More time with youHmm I heard an old song today and it took me to yesterday
Back to the time when your love was mine now the song lingers on in my mind
Stirring mem'ries that I'd left behind the time of my life when I was your wife
Now the song I've heard was our song today
Today the strangest thing happened and I just had the right to tell you about it
Remember the guitar that you sent little Jimmy on his birthday
Well he sure is learning to play it
Today he played a song just for me but I had to turn away so he wouldn't see me cry
Cause you see he was playin' our song the one that used to be his lullaby
I heard our song my dear and it brought you so close so near
Though years have gone by it still made me cry when I heard our song today mhmHe was born and raised around Jacksonville
A nice young man not the kind to kill
But the jealous fight and a flashing blade
Sent him on the run through the Everglades
Runnin' like the dog through the Everglades
Now the posse went in and they came back out
And said he'll die and there ain't no doubt
It's an eye for an eye the debt is paid
You won't last long in the Everglades
A man can't live in the everglades
Where a man can hide and never be found
And have no fear of the baying hounds
But he better keep movin' and don't stand still
If the skeeters don't get him in Gatersville
If the skeeters don't get him in the Gatersville
[ ac.guitar ]
Now the years went by and his girl was wed
His family gave him up for dead
Now and then the natives would say
They'd seen him a runnin' through the Everglades
Runnin' like the dog through the Everglades
Now he never heard the news on the radio
He was deep in the glades and he'll never know
He's runnin' and a hidin' and didn't make much sense
The jury had ruled it was self-defence
The jury had ruled it was self-defence
Where a man can hide...I'm gonna ride ride ride ride down that dusty trail
To the land of sweet enchantment where hardship don't prevail
I'm headin' for the blue horizon where the mountains meet the sky
Gonna saddle up my faithful pinto and wave the boys goodbye
I'll say so long to mom and dad and tell sister not to cry
Cause I'm headin' for the blur horizon where the mountains meet the sky
I'm gonna ride ride ride ride down that dusty trail
To the land of sweet enchantment where hardship don't prevail
When my roundup days are over and I'll say my last goodbye
I'll be up in the blue horizon where the mountains meet the skyWell it's Saturday night,
Your all dressed up in blue.
I've been watchin' you a while,
Maybe you've been watchin' me too.
So somebody ran out,
Left somebody's heart a mess.
Well if you're lookin' for love,
Honey I'm tougher than the rest.
Some girls they want a handsome Dan,
Or some good lookin' Joe,
On their arm some girls want a sweet talkin' Romeo.
But round here baby,
I've learned you get what you can get,
So if your lookin' for love,
Honey I'm tougher than the rest.
Oh your road is dark,
And there's a thin thin line,
But I want you to know,
I'd walk it for you anytime.
And all your other boyfriends,
They couldn't pass the test.
So if you're lookin' for love,
Honey I'm Tougher than the rest.
Well it ain't no secret,
I've been around a time or two.
Well I don't know but,
Maybe you've been around too.
Well there's another dance,
All you gotta do is say yes.
And if you're lookin' for Love,
Honey I'm tougher than the rest.
And if you're ready for love,
Honey I'm tougher than the rest.I met her one evenin' in a bar room downtown
She was the picture of truth
Her shoulders were sagged and her head was bowed down
Like me she was livin' the blues
When the music had ended and the crowd dwindled down
And we were the last lonely two
We left with each other when nothin' was left
And nothin' left better to do
And it was fun while it lasted but it didn't last long
Before we knew it the thrill was all gone
And we both wound up singin' the same lonesome song
It was fun while it lasted, but it didn't last long
I had a woman and she had a man
Before we both lost it all
When I thought of her that's when she thought of him
And I never could stand that thoughtI can picture you the day you were born
Baby girl in your mama's arms and destined for great things
Crazy thing bout an angel like you
All the things you know how to do
And yet the world tries to clip your wings
But you wouldn't let 'em, so baby go get 'em
Bust that ceiling out, the sky's the limit now
The world is changing fast
Wear your hair back and run
Like you ain't ever done before
It's your time at last
All you've been through ain't in vain
Come on baby make it rain down shattered glass
It's kind of fun for a guy like me
Sitting here in your shotgun seat
Watching you leave them all in the dust
Because I believe in you
And I want to see your dreams come true
So bust that ceiling out, the sky 's the limit now
Time to make up for the past
Wear your hair back and run
Like you ain't ever done before
I want to see you kick some ass
I'm so proud to know you, girl
Most beautiful thing in the world is all this shattered glass
No time to waste, got to make this moment yours
Got a whole lot of history to make up for
So bust that ceiling out, the sky's the limit now
The world is changing fast
All you've been through ain't in vain
Well come on baby make it rain down shattered glass(Dolly Parton)
I used to sit for hours as a kid
Dangle my feet from an old flat bridge,
Seein' myself in the water below
Shatter my image with the stones I'd throw
I recall a vacant old shack
Down by the edge of the tobaccer patch
A child's reflection in a dirty window
Shatter my image with the stones I'd throw
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
They shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones they throw
I'm far from perfect, but I ain't all bad;
It hurts me more than it makes me mad
You gather your stones by stoopin' so low
Then shatter my image with the stones you throw
If you live in a glass house, don't throw stones
Don't shatter my image 'til you look at your own
Look at your reflection in your house of glass
Don't open my closet if your own's full of trash
Stay out of my closet if your own's full of trash
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
They shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones they throw
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
They shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
Don't shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throwThere goes my reason for living there goes my everything
I hear footsteps slowly walking as they gently walk across a lonely floor
And a voice is softly saying darling this will be goodbye forever more
There goes my reason for living there goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession there goes my everything
As my mem'ry turns back the pages I can see the happy years we've had before
Now the love that kept this old heart beating
Has been shattered by the closing of a door
There goes my reason for living
There goes my everythingI am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun
For another overload
I hear you singin' in the wires
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows
That stretch down south
Will never stand the strain
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line(Dolly Parton)
Come back to me
Come back and say you're still in love with me
Come back and say that I am all you'll ever need
Baby come back come back to me
Oh please come back to me
Come back and say you'll work it out with me
Come back to stay and say you're never gonna leave
Baby come back, come back to me
Oh and kiss me once again as only you can
Touch me like nobody else can do
Oh, oh, and hold me and show me you're still my man
And that you didn't need somebody new
Oh come back to me
Come back and hold this torch that's burning me
Come back and promise me eternity
Baby come back, won't you come back to me?
Kiss me once again as only you can
Touch me like nobody else can do
Oh, oh, oh, and hold me and show me you're still my man
And that you didn't need somebody new
Oh, come back to me
Come back and mend this broken heart in me
Without your love I know I'll never be complete
Baby come back, won't you come back to me
Oh please come back to me
Baby come back, baby come back to me
Baby come back, come back and say I'm all you need
Come back, won't you come back to me
Come back to me
Come back and say you're still in love with me
Come back and say that I am all you'll ever need
Baby come back won't you come back to me
Oh, please come back to me
Come back and hold this torch that's burning me
Come back and promise me eternity...This old world's gone crazy, my life's livin' proof
Always runnin' around, no time to slow down
I don't know what I would do, if I didn't have you
Day in, day out and every night from dusk till dawn
This world spins round and girl, you keep me hangin' on
When the winds of doubt are blowin', your love keeps me goin'
Somehow, day in day out
I get so worn out and worried, keepin' up this pace
But you ease my mind every time, I get caught up in the race
You're my saving grace
Day in, day out and every night from dusk till dawn
This world spins round and girl, you keep me hangin' on
When the winds of doubt are blowin', your love keeps me goin'
Somehow, day in day outSweet Lucinda
Look out your window
LA freeway just like the man said
People honking their horns
Pointing guns at your head
Sweet Lucinda
In a land of cotton
You're not forgotten
The Mississippi River just rolls on through
And everybody's wondering what happened to you
In the land of cotton
Down on the delta
Remember your soul
We're waiting just to welcome you back to the fold
Tomorrow comes early
You better get humming
The whole damn town is gonna know that you're coming
Bring it on home to Memphis
Bring it on home to Memphis
Bring it on home to Memphis
Bring it on home to Memphis
Bring it on home and give us a thrill
Bring it on home honey send me the bill
Bring it on home to Memphis
Bring it on home to Memphis
Beale Street was jumping the day you were born
W.C. Handy was blowing his horn
From the bluffs to Mud Island
The music grew quiet
Mystery train put a hush on the night
Fireflies made light of the hot summer breeze
And the wind was a whisper through the tops of the trees
Rain started falling
The river grew lazy
Bring it on home child you're making us crazy
We've got hot buttered biscuits
And dewberry pie
White-flour gravy
In an endless supply
Cucumber salad right out of the ground
And cold soda water just to wash it all down
But down on the Delta
Where cotton is king
We only want to treat you like a homecoming queen
Tomorrow comes early
It's never too late
The whole damn town is gonna open the gateTHEN I'LL BE FREE
(Don Bowman - Ray Corbin)
Â« Â© '64 Central Songs Â»
All I gotta do is forget about you
And find someone who will be true that'll never leave me
Think about something all the time get you far and out off my mind I'll be free
Oh free to do what I wanna do not sit at home and think about you
Oh I can find me someone new then I'll be free
Get your long black shiny hair cause the fun we used to share then I'll be free
All I gotta do is forget your face and never go back to any place I'll be free
Oh free to do what I wanna do...
Oh free to do what I wanna do.Way Back home where the cypress grew
In a clapboard shack on the black bayou
Live a woman and a man that I call Mom and Dad
And Times were hard and times were tough
We barely had nothing' but we didn't need much
Except for the love of a woman and a man
Daddy worked his fingers to the bone
But I know my momma was the reason he was strong
[Chorus]
Everybody knows if the cold wind blows
The seeds don't sprout and the crops won't grow
Even though you've done the best you can
And when you're living in a house that you don't own
And the money in the bank is almost gone
The only thing in life I know that stands
Is the love between a woman and a man
Well, I grew up working like my daddy did
Broke the land with my hands and the money rolled in
But it wasn't enough and I did not understand
You see, the only thing that matters money can't buy
And when it gets down the bottom line
It's the love you find between a woman and a man
Everything Daddy said to me was true
Cause my life was not complete until I found you
[Chorus: x2]
Only thing in life that stands
Is the love between a woman and a manAn old piece of rope held up his pants
As I backed up he threw up his hands
So, I got out and closed the door
And asked him what he stopped me for
He reached down and picked up a burlap bag
There at the city dump he showed me all he had
A blanket for the colder nights
An old King James and a pocket knife
A worn out watch and a lucky rabbits foot
A picture in a broken frame
He said, ?I wish I knew her name?
As he gently brushed his hand across her face
"What some people throw away"
I turned to hide my tear-filled eyes
Then shook his hand and said goodbye
To me it was just a second load
But he held it like a bag of gold
I was too ashamed to tell him at the time
Everything he was holding was mine
A blanket for the colder nights
An old King James and a pocket knife
A worn out watch and a lucky rabbits foot
A picture in a broken frame
He'll never know I knew her name
What I'd give to put that smile back on her face
"What some people throw away"
A picture in a broken frame
He'll never know I knew her name
What I'd give to put that smile back on her face
"What some people throw away"
Oh, it broke my heart to hear that old man say
What some people throw awayYou're fumbling around in the bedroom
Trying to put on your shoes
Hair still down, dress half on
Looking like you're about to blow a fuse
I know what's about to happen
I can read you like a book
You're about to shoot that cute little
'Yeah, we're late' look
And there it is
Baby, don't move
I wanna soak this in
I've got a new favorite memory of you
Driving through town, running red lights
You take my hand in the car
Finally make it to the restaurant
And our friends are two drinks in at the bar
I know what's about to happen
Yeah, folks don't change that dial
She's about to light the room up
With a laugh and a smile
And there it is
Baby, don't move
I wanna soak this in
I've got a new favorite memory of you
Yeah, I'm gonna fall farther
Baby, I know
Wait for it, wait for it
Here I go
You're fumbling around in the bedroom
Trying to take off your shoes
Hair back down, dress half off
You look at me
And there it is
Baby, don't move
I wanna soak this in
I've got a new favorite memory of you
Here we go again
I've got a new favorite memory of youWe're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I'm saying
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
We can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds
So, if an old friend I know
Drops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes
Here we go again
Asking where I've been
Can't you see these tears are real
I'm crying
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
We can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds
Oh, let our love survive
I'll dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
Honey, you know
I've never lied to you
No, never lie to you, yeah
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I'm saying
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, babyI guess it's human nature
Tuggin' at my sleeve
That gets me thinking too much
'bout what I'm 'sposed to be
I keep aiming higher
Like everybody else
Forgetting what I need to be
Is just to be myself
It's not like everybody's waiting
To see if I'll go far
It's not like everybody's watching
Though sometimes I think they are
I don't have to change the world
I don't have to walk on water
All I have to be
Is my daughter's father
She's just like her mama
When it comes to me
Couldn't fool her if I tried to
To her I'll always be
Nothing more than daddy
And when she says that word
It a wonderful reminder
Of why I'm on this earth
It's not like everybody's waiting
To see if I'll go far
It's not like everybody's watching
Though sometimes I think they are
I don't have to change the world
I don't have to walk on water
All I have to be
Is my daughter's father
A man is often measured
By what he does in life
It made mine worth living
When I realized
It's not like everybody's waiting
To see if I'll go far
It's not like everybody's watching
Though sometimes I think they are
I don't have to change the world
I don't have to walk on water
All I have to be
Is my daughter's father
Yeah all I have to be
Is my daughter's fatherIf I cross your path again
Who knows where, who knows when
On some morning without number
On some highway without end
Don't grasp my hand and say
Fate has brought us here today
Oh, fate is only fooling with us friend
Keep your distance, keep your distance
When I feel you close to me, what can I do but fall
Keep your distance, keep your distance
For with us it must be all or none at all
It's a desperate game we play
Throw our souls, our lives away
On wounds that can't be mended
And debts that can't be paid
Well I played and I got stung
Now I'm biting back my tongue
And sweeping out the footprints where I strayed
Keep your distance, keep your distance
When I feel you close to me, what can I do but fall
Keep your distance, keep your distance
For with us it must be all or none at all
Oh, oh
Keep your distance, keep your distance
When I feel you close to me, what can I do but fall
Keep your distance, keep your distance
For with us it must be all or none at all
For with us it must be all or none at allDaddy had a chance to go
Take a factory jon in Ohio
The offered him a decent dime
To leave Kentucky far behind
Well, I cussed him when he turned em down
Standing farm, tobacco ground
Tobacco growing ain't no life
For seven kids and a poor man's wife
Money does not mean a thing
When you dream a farmer's dream
He could not toe that bottom line
Sometimes I cursed that poor man's pride
Cursed that poor man's pride
Now Daddy was a gambling man
He gambled on tobacco land
Bet your life every spring
To see what harvest time would bring
Could be drought, could be flood
Rolling dice was in his blood
No matter how it all went down
He's just as stubborn as that ground
Money does not mean a thing
When you dream a farmer's dream
He could not toe that bottom line
Sometimes I cursed that poor man's pride
Cursed that poor man's pride
Well, it finally drove him in the ground
Broke his back and put him down
Poor and proud is how he died
Sometimes I miss that poor man's prideThere was a time when I thought of no other and we sang our own love refrain
Our hearts beat as one while we had our fun but time changes everything
Time has passed I forgot you mother nature does wonderful things
I guess that it's true for me and for you that time changes everything
You can change the name of an old song rearrange it and make it swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you but time has changed everything
Goodbye good luck to you may God bless you I won't say I'll ever love again
You'll go your way and I'll go mine cause time changes everythingI was takin' a walk through a small country city
Just seem' what there was to see
I sat down to read a historical marker
When I felt someone sit down by me
He leaned on the tank that was helping his breathing
Said it's bad when your body is gone
I said this is sure a nice town that you've got here
He said yeah, but there's no place like home
I wish I could see Bakersfield
Where the oil wells are pumpin'
The oranges are bloomin'
And the grapevine winds down from the hill
When I close my eyes I can touch the clear skies
At the corner where I used to live
Oh I wish I could see Bakersfield
He said you don't ever know where life's gonna lead you
When you go ramblin' off down the track
Sometimes I wish I'd never left California
Then I couldn't want to go back
Recitation:
He said "You know, I used to be a well-known country singer
Made my first record back in 1953
At one time Buck Owens was my lead guitar player
And ol' Hag once wrote a song about me"
I wish I could see Bakersfield
Where the oil wells are pumpin'
The oranges are bloomin'
And the grapevine winds down from the hill
When I close my eyes I can touch the clear skies
At the corner where I used to live
Oh I wish I could see Bakersfield
Oh I wish I could see BakersfieldOn the wings of a snow white dove he sends his pure sweet love
A sign from above on the wings of a dove
When troubles surround us when evils come
The body grows weak the spirit grows numb
When these things beset us he doesn't forget us
He sends down his love on the wings of a dove
On the wings of a snow...
When Noah had drifted on the flood many days
He searched for land in various ways
Troubles he had some but wasn't forgotten
He sent him his love on the wings of a dove
On the wings of a snow...
On the wings of a snow...If I could love you like Elvis
Elvis back in '62
Hips on fire, full of desire
It wouldn't be good enough for you
And if you could love me like Marilyn
In the Garden back in '63
Singing 'Happy Birthday, Baby'
It wouldn't be good enough for me
'Cause that stuff ain't really real
No matter how good it feels
It's only skin deep and we
Are way beyond that now
Lying with you in the dark
Soul to soul and heart to heart
Baby you and I
Know how to be satisfied
A raindrop falls on the mountain
Slowly rolling to the sea
And it takes time to know what is love, what's a dream
And the difference in between
That other stuff ain't really real
No matter how good it feels
It's only skin deep and we
Are way beyond that now
Lying with you in the dark
Soul to soul and heart to heart
Baby you and I
Know how to be satisfiedWhat makes it easy to treat people bad?
Some things you say and you can't take 'em back
What makes it easy to run from the past,
like a child runs from the dark?
Which is the poison and which is the wine?
The scent and the colors are so much alike
And how much of each will it take to decide,
when your at the table alone?
Where do you go when it's perfectly clear?
You might find your way but you won't find it here
What makes it easy to sound so sincere,
when you know that you don't care?
Love gets lost
Love gets lost
Find my love
Find my love
How can you tell when goodbye means goodbye
Not just for now, for the rest of you life
How can you stand there with love in you eyes
And still be walking away
Love gets lost
Love gets lost
Find my love
Find my love
Find my love
Find my loveI was looking back to see if you were looking back to see
If I was looking back to see if you were looking back at me
You were cute as you could be standing looking back at me
And it was plain to see that I'd enjoy your company
One Sunday afternoon as I was ridin' down the street
I met a cute little girl all dressed up so neat
And the way that she was stacked I wish I'd've had a Cadillac
For who would notice me just drivin' this model T
I was looking back to see...
Now listen baby it don't matter to me
Even in your model T you're as cute as you can be
If you'll take me for a ride I will set close by your side
And I will guarantee that we'll have fun oh man aliveFriday night bout ten o'clock
Packed house, line around the block
The bands rockin' the dance floors full
Their crankin' up the speed on the mechanical bull
Line 'em up right across the bar
Look out party's really 'bout to start
The bar tender shouts OK who's next
The place goes crazy, well what did you expect
Cowboy tequila
Cowboy tequila
There ain't nothing in this whole wide world
That drives me wild
Like a sexy cowgirl
Shootin cowboy
Cowboy tequila
Here comes Suzie with her girl friends
She's kinda shy except for the weekends
A lick of salt from her long tanned neck
A hit of lemon straight from her lips
Shot 1 head spins
Shot 2 kicks in
Shot 3 I'm on my knees
Shot 4 on the floor and I want more more
I wake up with a hammer in my head
I swear I'll never do that again
Phone rings it Suzie on the line
I guess it wouldn't hurt me
Just one more time
Cowboy tequila
Cowboy tequila
There ain't nothing in this whole wide world quite like a
Cowboy tequila
Cowboy tequila
There ain't nothing in this whole world
That spins my spurs like a sexy cowgirl shootin' cowboy
Cowboy tequila
Cowboy tequilaA long time ago I left my home
For a job in the fruit trees
But I miss those hills with the windy pines
Their song seemed to suit me
So I sent my wages to my home
Said we'd soon be together
For the next good crop would pay my way
And I'd come home forever
[Chorus]
One more dime to show for my day
One more dollar and I'm on my way
When I reach those hills, boys, I'll never roam
'Cause one more dollar and I'm going home
No work said the boss at the bunkhouse door
There's a freeze on the branches
So when the dice came out at the bar downtown
I rolled and I took my chances
[Chorus]
A long time ago I left my home
Just a boy passing twenty
Could you spare a coin and a Christian prayer
For my luck has turned against me
[Chorus]
One more dollar, boys, I'm going homeI just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me, so
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
[Chorus]
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to townFORGIVE ME NOW

'63 Glad Music
I lost her love and started drinking trying hard to stop from thinking
And I found that it was not the thing to do
But I can't stop my heart from throbbin' couldn't ease the pain by sudden
Forgive me now and I will always do what's right
It's my fault my heart is broken angry words that we have spoken
I'm so sorry now for I have seen the light
Humbly hope that you still love me for I swear by stars above me
Forgive me now and I will always do what's right
Now I see I was mistaken and my heart is slowly breakin'
For I know that I was wrong right from the start
Let's renew our romance dear please just give once more chance dear
Forgive me now and I will always do what's right
It's my fault my heart is broken...We've agreed not to mention any memories
Or share a single passing thought
That's just better for all concerned, is what we've found
When you're living on the sad
There's always hope, but we don't ever let it show
'Cause hopes start out real small, but how they just grow
And, just like dreams, are better left alone
Is what we've found
When you're living on the sad side of town
Please never bring up how she used to laugh at night
Would smell so sweet and giggle when I squeezed her tight
If you can put a stop to that, there's a chance you might
Fit in here well enough to try this style of life
That's just better for all concerned, is what we've found
When you're living on the sad side of townA Christmas tree with lights turned low
Kids out of school, praying for snow
It's the season for counting blessings, as the old year ends
The crowded streets, the friendly smiles
At Christmas, everyone's a child
It's that precious time for family and friends
From our house to yours, we send our love
Straight from the heart, 'cause you mean so much
From our house to yours, may everyone be blessed
May this Christmas be the best, from our house to yours
Old memories and mistletoe
Cards signed with love, hang in a row
That feeling of Christmas fills the air
The manger scene, the star above
Reminds us all, God sends His love
May His spirit follow you throughout the year
From our house to yours, we send our love
Straight from the heart, 'cause you mean so much
From our house to yours, may everyone be blessed
And may this Christmas be the best from our house to yours
And may this Christmas be the best from our house to yours
Merry ChristmasLet's take a ride to the seaside
We can go out swimming in the high tide
Just wear your shorts and your long hair
Don't forget the lawn chair
Everybody's gone to the movies
Everybody's gone and its groovy
They went to the one about the big war
I didn't, I'd seen it before
I guess I'm taking my chances
Giving up the ring throwing in my gloves
I guess I'm taking my chances
Trading in my things
For a couple wings a little white dove
And one big love, one big love, one big love, one big love
Everybody do like a monkey
If you want to go on and be funky
No need to talk like a hero
Talk a walk count down to zero
No sense defending your honor
Just go on and kiss him if you want to
Everything before is gone or, going somewhere
I guess I'm taking my chances
Giving up the ring throwing in my gloves
I guess I'm taking my chances
Trading in my things for a couple wings on a
Little white dove
And one big love, one big love, one big love, one big love
I don't know where we are
And I don't care
And now we're out of gas
And riding on air
And one big love, one big love, one big love, one big love
Let's take a ride to the seaside
We can go out swimming in the high tide
Everybody's gone to the movies
Everybody's gone and its groovy
Everybody do like a monkey
If you want to go on and be funky
No need to talk like a hero
Talk a walk count down to zero
No sense defending your honor
Just go on and kiss him if you want toBefore I knew your name, I was not blistered or burned
I gave love everything before you had it returned
Before I knew your name, I had my pride in tact
But you set my heart on fire before you gave it back
So I'm gonna rewind to a place and time
To the man I was, before your love
Wrecked my heart, and my soul, and my mind
Before I knew your name, before I knew your name
Ain't no drink or drug
That's gonna get me there
I've been down that road, your still just as gone
After the fog has cleared
So I'm gonna rewind to a place and time
To the man I was, before your love
Wrecked my heart, and my soul, and my mind
Before I knew your name, before I knew your name
Is it somewhere south of Austin?
Hiding in St. Paul
In the deserts east of L.A.
Hell, I might try them all
Somewhere to rewind to a place and time
To the man I was, before your love
Wrecked my heart, and my soul, and my mind
Before I knew your name, before I knew your name
Before I knew your name, before I knew your nameHe walked into the bar and parked his lanky frame upon a tall barstool
And with a long soft Southern drawl said
"I'll just have a glass of anything that's cool"
A barroom girl with hard and knowing eyes slowly looked him up and down
And she thought "I wonder how on earth
That country bumpkin found his way to town"
She said "Hello, country bumpkin"
"How's the frost out on the pumpkin?"
"I've seen some sights but, man, you're somethin'"
"Where'd ya come from, country bumpkin?"
It was just a short year later in a bed of joy-filled tears yet death-like pain
Into this wondrous world of many wonders one more wonder came
That same woman's face was wrapped up
In a raptured look of love and tenderness
As she marveled at the soft and warm and cuddly boy-child feeding at her breast
And she said "Hello, country bumpkin"
"Fresh as frost out on the pumpkin"
"I've seen some sights but, babe, you're somethin'"
"Mamma loves her country bumpkin"
Forty years of hard work later in a simple, quiet and peaceful country place
The heavy hand of time had not erased
The raptured wonder from the woman's face
She was lying on her deathbed knowing fully well her race was nearly run
But she softly smiled and looked into the sad eyes of her husband and her son
And she said "So long, country bumpkin"
"The frost is gone now from on the pumpkin"
"I've seen some sights and life's been somethin'"
"See you later, country bumpkin"
She said "So long, country bumpkin"
"The frost is gone now from on the pumpkin"
FADE
"I've seen some sights and life's been somethin'"With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kinda hard bein Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, I somehow, some way-hay
Keep comin up funky ass shit man every single day, and
Can I kick a little sompin for the G's (yeah)

Dont you know it's Two in the mawnin and

Chorus:
Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]
Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]
Verse Two:
I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
you know this type of shit, happens all the time
You got to get yours before I get mine
Everything is fine when you listenin to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating me but
who hears, to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
i started laughin with this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
(ya know?) She used to be the homeboy's lady
dontcha kno its Eighty degrees? when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze

Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]
Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]
Verse Three:
Later on that day-hay
My homey Dr. Dre he came by with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J-hay, of some bubonic chronic you know it made me cho-oke
it ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup of gin do-own
(dontcha kno) Tanqueray and chronic, well I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin, I'm still poppin
Dr Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me, not with a cherry on top
Cause when I bust my nut, you know I'm raisin up off the cot
Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, thats why I'm out the do'
And I'll be
Chorus
Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]

Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice (beeotch!!)
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]Just as far as I can remember she'll remain the rose of my heart
Mama took sick along in December February brought us broken hearts
The reason we've not called the family reunion is we knew that you wouldn't be there
But now that we thought it all over mama we know that the spirit is here
No no I can't forget the hours you're the only one mama and sweeter than the flowers
No no there's no need to bother to speak of you now would only hurt farther
Oh no mama I'll never forget you and someday I'll meet you up there
No no I can't forget the hoursThe look in your eyes when you left here that night
Was like somebody had stolen your soul
The trance you were in made me crawl in my skin
You were under some outer control
But I won't give up hopin' the spell can be broken
When you come around to your own good sense
When you break the chains and you're free again
I'll be waiting here to take you in
When you come around
If it takes a day or a hundred years
Me and my heart are gonna be right here
To pick love up where we put it down
When you come around
The moon can't see out from behind the winter clouds
Don't know how you could find your way home
So I'll stay up all night like I do every night
To make sure that the porch light stays on
The winds may be blowin' but these arms will be open
When you come around to your own good sense
When you break the chains and you're free again
I'll be waiting here to take you in
When you come around
If it takes a day or a hundred years
Me and my heart are gonna be right here
To pick love up where we put it down
When you come around
If it takes a day or a hundred years
Me and my heart are gonna be right here
To pick love up where we put it down
When you come around
When you come around
When you come aroundI'm as free as the breeze happy as you please
While you're singing the blues in the rain
Used to have me begging down on my knees but you'll never see me there again
You had a bed of clover when you stay with me
But now you're on the outside and I've got the key
And I'm as free as the breeze happy as you please
While you're singing the blues in the rain
[ guitar + steel ]
I'm as free as the breeze happy as you please
While you're singing the blues in the rain
Used to have me begging down on my knees but you'll never see me there again
I'm gettin' tired of carin' all this heavy load
I'm tearin' up your playhouse so get on down the road
Cause I'm as free as the breeze happy as you please
While you're singing the blues in the rain
[ guitar + steel + piano ]
I'm as free as the breeze happy as you please
While you're singing the blues in the rain
Used to have me begging down on my knees but you'll never see me there again
I used to pay the bills and let you run about
But now your little gravy train has done full out
And I'm as free as the breeze happy as you please
While you're singing the blues in the rain
While you're singing the blues in the rainIn the black dust towns of East Tennessee
All the works about the same
Well you may not go to a job in the ground
But you'll learn the Miner's Refrain
[Chorus]
I'm down in a hole, I'm down in a hole
Down in a deep dark hole
I'm down in a hole, I'm down in a hole
Down in a deep dark hole
Well you searched the rain for the silver cloud
And you wait on days of gold
When you pitch to the bottom and the dirt comes down
You cry, so cold, so cold
[Chorus]
Now there's something good in a worried song
For the trouble in your soul
Cause a worried man's been a long way down
Down in a deep dark hole
[Chorus]
I'm down in a deep dark holeLittle baby told God, hey I'm kind of scared.
Don't really know if I want to go down there.
From here it looks like a little blue ball
That's a great big place and I'm so small.
Why can't I just, stay here with you?
Did I make you mad, don't you want me too?
God said oh child, of course I do
But there's somebody special waiting for you
So hush now baby, don't you cry
'Cause there's someone down there waiting whose only goal in life
Is making sure you're always gonna be alright
A loving angel tender, tough and strong
It's almost time to go and meet your mom.
You'll never have a better friend
Or a warmer touch to tuck you in
She'll kiss your bruises, your bumps and scrapes
And anytime you hurt
Her heart's gonna break
So hush now baby, don't you cry
'Cause there's someone down there waiting whose only goal in life
Is making sure you're always gonna be alright
A loving angel tender, tough and strong
It's almost time to go and meet your mom.
And when she's talking to you make sure you listen close
'Cause she's gonna teach you everything you'll ever need to know
Like how to mind your manners, to love and laugh and dream
She'll put you on the path that bring you back to me
So, hush now little baby, don't you cry
'Cause there's someone down there waiting whose only goal in life
Is making sure you're always gonna be alright
A loving angel tender, tough and strong
Come on child it's time, to meet your momSo now there's somebody new
These dreams I've been dreaming have all fallen through
You say I'll be fine, it only takes time
Someday that may be true
But it's too soon to tell
Why it's too soon to say
Maybe someday I'll be able to wish you well
But right now it's just too soon to tell
It's all for the best, so you say
You never intended to hurt me this way
You want to hear, I won't drown in my tears
Well, baby the best that I can say
Is it's too soon to tell
Why it's too soon to say
Maybe someday I'll be able to wish you well
But right now it's just too soon to tellI believe every lyin' word you told to me
When you whispered your sweet love belonged to me
How was I to know you would let me down
Well that's how this lonely king won this lonely crown
So long live the king the king of fools the king with the castle filled with gloom
A king whose treasures are just memories of you
Long live the king the lonely king of fools
When your fling is through I know that you'll be back once more
And the king of fools will take you back just like before
You'll fool me till you find somebody new
Then once again I'll be the lonely king of fools
So long live the king...We are not in a position to display these lyrics due to licensing restrictions. Sorry for the inconvinience.You may be sweet and nice
But that won't keep you warm at night
'cause I'm the one who showed you how
To do the things you're doing now
He may feel all your charms
He may hold you in his arms
But I'm the one who let you in
I was right beside you then
Once upon a time you let me feel you deep inside
And nobody knew and nobody saw
Do you remember the way you cried?
I'm your toy, I'm your ol' boy
And I don't want no one but you to love me
No, I wouldn't lie
You know I'm not that kind of guyI hear the bluebirds singing I hear the robins too
I hear the church bells ringing but I don't hear you
I see little things marked his and hers a constant reminder we're through
I hear the rain on my window but I don't hear you
[ steel ]
I hear the children playing I hear the clock striking two
I hear the mailman whistling but I don't hear you
I see little things...
Oh but I don't hear youWell I know you hate my drinkin'
And the way I talk sometimes
But you hate it most when I don't call at night
And it's just because you lose me
And you worry 'bout your man
You do the best you can with who I am
[Chorus]
Burnin' both ends of a candle
Can leave one in the dark
And I know what I put you through is hard upon your heart
And it's just that you're concerned for me
Sweetheart I understand
You do the best you can with who I am
You go to church on Sunday
While I'm still home in bed
Sleepin' off the night I had before
And sometimes you say I'm perfect
And sometimes not worth a damn
You do the best you can with who I am
[Chorus]If anyone could find the joy that true love brings a girl and boy
We could we could you and I
If anyone could ever say that their true love was here to stay
We could we could you and I
When you're in my arms I know you're happy to be there
And just as long as I'm with you I'm happy anywhere
If anyone could pray each night to thank the Lord that all is right
We could we could you and I
When you're in my armsDriving along on that endless road
just headin' for the silver sky.
Rolling along to a brand new song
dreamin' up another lie.
Through mountains in to canyons where rivers run below.
Still movin' down that highway
lookin' for a place to go.
'Cause I'm a Neon Cowboy and I'm a ridin' that freedom road.
A neon cowboy and your tears are my only load.
Always lookin' for that rainbow where ever I may roam
a Neon Cowboy's always comin' home.
I watch T.V. in my motel room
till I lose the light of day.
Then I slip into a six pack dream and drink the night away.
The city lights are flashin' and I'm starin' at the phone
but it's much late for callin'
feelin' like I'm far too gone.
'Cause I'm a Neon Cowboy and I'm a ridin' that freedom road.
A neon cowboy and your tears are my only load.
Always lookin' for that rainbow where ever I may roam
a Neon Cowboy's always comin' home.
I'm a Neon Cowboy and I'm a ridin' that freedom road.
A neon cowboy and your tears are my only load.
Far beyond the blue horizon where ever I may roam
your Neon Cowboy's always on the run.
I'm a Neon Cowboy and I'm out on this road alone.
A neon cowboy in my heart I can feel your song.
I'm still look in for that rainbow where ever I may roam
your Neon Cowboy's always on the run.(Gary Harrison - Kent Robbins - Gene Miller)
I changed my number, I gave you back my picture
I said you're someone I don't wanna see
I told my friends at work it wasn't worth the hurt
But it's a different story when I go to sleep
Chorus
Dreams don't lie - dreams don't lie
I say I don't love you but the truth comes out at night
Dreams don't lie
Old friends call, they're careful not to talk about you
I say it's alright, you never even cross my mind
Then I hang up the phone, I say I like it here alone
I can fool myself until I close my eyes
Chorus
I don't love you, I don't need you
I don't want you in my life
I cane make it sound convincing
'Til I turn out the lightWhen the rooms are crowded eyes will wander
Never knowing what they'll find
I came in waiting on another
Now you're all that's on my mind
Beneath a chorus of conversation
What no one else can see
Is a gamble between two strangers
That's taken a hold of me
So, let go of your halo
Break free for a while
Tell me that you're ready
And into the night
Wrong or right
Before it slips right through our hands
Let me catch you while I can
My courage rises, I walk over
Your curled smile calms me down
Words come easy, I keep you laughing
I should stop but I don't know how
So, let go of your halo
Break free for a while
Tell me that you're ready
And into the night
Wrong or right
Before it slips right through our hands
Let me catch you while I can
When the midnight turns into daylight, maybe we'll both move on
But who knows, maybe tomorrow lonely will be long gone
Be long gone
So, let go of your halo
Break free for a while
Tell me that you're ready
And into the night
Wrong or right
Before it slips right through our hands
Let me catch you while I can
Let me catch you while I canI wish I didn't love you so
My love for you should have faded long ago
I wish I didn't need your kiss
Why must your kiss torture me as long as this?
I might be smiling by know with some new tender friend
Smiling by know with my heart on the mend
But when I try, something in that heart says no
You're still there, I wish I didn't love you so
But when I try, something in that heart says no
You're still there I wish I didn't love you soHey baby what do you know about how it feels
Honey what do you know about if that's real
Baby what do you know about the whole deal
And what'd you know about love
Hey baby what do you know about all its dreams
Honey what do you know about Cupid's schemes
Baby what do you know about what that means
And what'd you know about love
For I've been longing to find
Another heart that would know
And it seems like yours just might
Hey baby what do you know about it's first blush
Honey what do you know about the caught up rush
Baby what do you know about what to trust
And what do you know about love, woah no
My heart's so often been wrong
That it still can't be sure
If this finally did come along
Hey baby what do you know about all its dreams
Honey what do you know about Cupid's schemes
Baby what do you know about what that means
And what'd you know about love
Oh take it down
Hey baby what do you know about how it feels
Honey what do you know about if that's real
Baby what do you know about the whole deal
And what'd you know about love
Oh baby, tell me what do you know about the whole deal
And what do you know about loveI'm no poet and I know it
I don't use five dollar words
This might not sound like much compared to all the pretty things you've heard
But here's how I'd explain it
Since you brought it up
It won't sound like anybody else's version of love
It's like just before dark
Jump in the car
Buy an ice cream
And see how far we can drive before it melts kind of feelin'
There's a cow in the road
And you swerve to the left
Fate skips a beat and it scares you to death
And you laugh until you cry
That's how your love makes me feel inside
It might not be suitable for greeting cards and such
But it's a true and honest feeling
And if you feel it half as much
We could go through life together without a worry or a care
Knowin' deep down in our hearts
We've got something special there
It's like just before dark
Jump in the car
Buy an ice cream
And see how far we can drive before it melts kind of feelin'
There's a cow in the road
And you swerve to the left
Fate skips a beat and it scares you to death
And you laugh until you cry
That's how your love makes me feel inside
That's how your love makes me feel
I have always heard
You can't put love into words
It's like just before dark
Jump in the car
Buy an ice cream
And see how far we can drive before it melts kind of feelin'
There's a cow in the road
And you swerve to the left
Fate skips a beat and it scares you to death
And you laugh until you cry
That's how your love makes me feel inside
That's how your love makes me feel inside
That's how your love makes me feel inside
That's how I feel
That's how your love makes me feelI come from a place
Where every name
And every place
Seem so familiar
In came this progress
In her black dress
Look at the mess
She is a killer
Much like you and I
And every case that's made
There has to be a traitor
It's me this time
And I'm trading fun for right
Will I regret the notion later?
Geraldine's the name that comes to mind
When I go back to reminiscing
Abilene's a woman for my childhood
I spent the evenings kissing
I'm a fool for treating her alive
And loving something cold and rocky
The homophobic gentlemen
They'll barricade but their efforts couldn't stop me
In came this progress
In her black dress
Look at the mess
She is a killer
In came this progress
In her black dress
Look at the mess
She is a killer
In came this progress
In her black dress
Look at the mess
She is a killer
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-ohI got a hard head, I get that from my dad
And I can overreact maybe just a tad
I put up walls to show the world I'm tough
When I don't get my way I get difficult
But when it comes to lovin' me
Baby you make it look so easy
You're my refuge from the road, a safe place to go
When I'm out here livin' on this ledge
And when I'm circlin' the drain, you keep my crazy sane
And quiet all the voices in my head
I'm probably wrong, more than I say
And I'd point that out, if you were that way
Yeah, I'm hard to love and ever harder to live with
And I know there's days, when you just want to up and quit
But when it comes to lovin' me
Baby you make it look so easy
You're my compass when I'm lost, my anchor when I get tossed
And the right way when all I can do is wrong
Sometimes I drink till I fall down but your arms save me from the ground
And hold me till all the hurt is gone
I got a hard head, I was born that way
And that makes me wrong more than I say
But I thank God you got a hard head too
I guess he must have known you'd need that to get us through
Cause when it comes to lovin' me
Baby you make it look so easy
Yeah, baby you, make it look so easyWritten by billy burnette and robb royer.
Well love's an ocean, deep and wide
Too big to see the other side
What's waiting there for me and you
Out in the blue
We'll never know until we try
It may be a rough and raging sea
That goes on for eternity
Throw your caution to the wind
Sink or swim
Just jump in and?
(chorus)
Let me rock you on the water
Where the winds of passion blow
If we go drifting out too far
We'll follow the brightest star
To the edge of love
Let me take you to another world
Where you an feel the undertow
And if that's getting in too deep
Just come with me at least
To the edge of love
Honey, let's just ride the wave
And let it carry us away
Let your heart just be your guide
I'll be there right by your side
Don't be afraid
We can tell each other's history
And leave the rest to mystery
We may never understand
Hold on tight, take my hand and?
(repeat chorus)EVERYBODY'S REACHING OUT FOR SOMEONE
Writers Dickey Lee, Allen Reynolds
Ev'rybody's reaching out for somebody
Er'rybody's knocking at some door
And long before I ever found you
You're the one that I was reaching for
Just like the trees along the river bend
Life up their branches to the sun above
We spend our life times reaching for a friend
'Cause ev'rybody needs someone to love
I've wanted you since the day my life began
I heard your footsteps running just beyond my mind
Ever since that moment I've been reaching for your han
Hoping you'd be reaching out for mineI slept sweetly unpretending
That the night was always ending
She breathed lightly right next to me
And I dreamed of her inside of me
And in my dream she sang so sweetly
A melody I hope to sing
So enslaved by her sweet wonder
It cut my legs and fingered hunger
She sang my name and so engulfed
I cried and felt my legs fail
In her arms I trembled electric
Oh and she let me and she held me
Then waking she was older still
And holds my love against its will
In spell cast with her palms extended
Cursed love is never ending
Cursed eyes are never closing
Cursed arm are never closing
Cursed children never rising
And cursed me never despising
Oh I am loving always holding
While she sleeps her song enfolding
Epic song it tells of how
She and I are living now
Dawn: cursed love (repeat)Heart don't get your hopes up eyes now don't you shine
Feet don't start to dancin' till she tells me she'll be mine
Lips don't start to smilin' voice don't sing too soon
So heart don't get your hopes up till she says she loves me too
Don't start making plans to hurt me there's a lotta bridges yet to cross
Don't count your chicken fore fore they'll start to hatch
Better keep your cote behind the horse
Truth she hardly knows it she needs a little time
So heart don't get your hopes up till I'm certain she'll be mine
Till I'm certain she'll be mineI'm a-walking the dog and I'm never blue
I'm a-walking the dog and thinking about you
I don't need no one to tie me down
I'm a-walking the dog and painting the town
Such an easy life I never knew
Until the day that I left you
Well, I'm a carefree lad that's seen the light
I'm a-walking the dog all day and all night
Well, I'm full of pep, I just can't grow old
I got a one track mind so I've been told
But I'm fancy free, I don't worry no how
And I'm a-walking the dog all the law allow
Such an easy life I never knew
Until the day that I left you
Well, I'm a carefree lad that's seen the light
I'm a-walking the dog all day and all nightSome people say there's no American dream
I hear them talking but they don't say a thing
I still believe you've got to give it to get
Baptize your every aspiration in sweat
I vow my head each night and roll up my sleeves
'Cause buddy it's a long hard road to Easy Street
Where all the cars go
Fast, fast, fast
When you step on the gas, gas, gas
Nobody else is gonna pass me up going down the road
I want a great big house on the hill
Every pocket full of hundred dollar bills
Givin' me a thrill, thrill, thrill I ain't never known
Is that asking too much
Am I over the line
Am I way out of touch
Tell me am I losing my mind
I know I won't never get enough
Is that asking too much
I've never been accused of dreaming too small
I never saw no shame in wanting it all
I guess that's just the curse of being born poor
No matter what you got you always want more
Everybody wants a lot, a little inside
I'm not the only one with hungry eyes
That wants a car that goes
Fast, fast, fast
When you step on the gas, gas, gas
Nobody else is gonna pass me up going down the road
I want a great bid house on the hill
Every pocket full of hundred dollar bills
Man, givin me a thrill, thrill, thrill I ain't never known
Is that asking too much
Am I over the line
Am I way out of touch
Tell me am I losing my mind
I know I won't never get enough
Is that asking too much
I just wanna go fast, fast, fast
When I step on the gas, gas, gas
Nobody else is gonna pass me up going down the road
I want a great big house on the hill
Every pocket full of hundred dollar bills
Man givin me a thrill, thrill, thrill I ain't never known
When I step on the gas, gas, gas
You know I wanna go fast, fast, fast
Nobody better ever pass me up going down the road
I gotta build me a house on the hill
Every pocket full of hundred dollar bills
Man, givin' me a thrill, thrill, thrill I ain't never known
Now is that asking too much(Instrumental)Girl I can tell that you're thinking of leaving
But it'll hurt me so much you don't want me to know
You've done all you can to hide what you're feeling
Oh, but one part of you, it let's your feelings show
Oh, your fingertips tell me you'll stay
And your warm red lips say you won't go away
And your lovin' arms make me think you're still mine
Whoa girl, if only your eyes could lie
So I say what's wrong and darlin' you just say it's nothin'
I can almost believe it hun when I hold you like this
But I know in my heart that there's no tomorrow
So just for tonight hun I'll pretend that there is
Oh, your fingertips tell me you'll stay
And your warm red lips say you won't go away
And your lovin' arms make me think you're still mine
Whoa girl, if only your eyes could lieWhen the Saviour calls I will answer when he calls for me I will hear
When the Saviour calls I will answer I'll be somewhere listening for my name
I'll be somewhere (listening) I'll be somewhere (listening)
I'll be somewhere listening for my name
I'll be somewhere (listening) I'll be somewhere (listening)
I'll be somewhere listening for my name
[ guitar ]
If my heart is right when he calls me if my heart is right I will hear
If my heart is right when he calls me I'll be somewhere listening for my name
I'll be somewhere (listening)...
[ guitar ]
If my robe is white when he calls me when my robe is white I will hear
If my robe is white when he calls me I'll be somewhere listening for my name
I'll be somewhere (listening)...We started out together chasing dreams of things to be
But we got separated and you slipped away from me
The road you chose to travel was the road of shame and sin
And every time you changed your mind I'd take you back again
You're back again there's no regret this time I don't want you
The love you thought would be here yet belongs to someone new
I'll never face another night alone and wonderin' when
I'll hear a knock upon the door and you'll be back again
For oh so long I've been the fool who kept forgiving you
While in my heart I always knew you never would be true
If you've been laughin' up your sleep this time the joke's on you
Cause while you have been foolin' round I found somebody new
You're back again there's no regret
I'll hear a knock upon the door and you'll be back againYou call me up at five to five, and you ask me if I'll drop by
That you need me, tonight you're all alone
Like the fool I am and the fool I'll be, I drove there anxiously
But when I got there, you were not alone
[Chorus:]
When will I ever learn that you'll never care about me?
You only build me up to bring me down again
When will I ever learn that you'll use me and abuse me?
Oh, tell me; when will I ever learn?
When will I learn, when will I get wise; you never apologize
I swear that this time I'm through with you
Like the fool I am and the fool I'll be, the next time you need me
Once again I'll give in to you
[Chorus]When I first saw you I saw something I hadn't seen in a long long time
I saw a lady who looked like a woman who could drive me right out of my mind
But I also saw your diamond and your golden wedding band
I know you're married but I've gotta ask you how married are you Mary Ann
Are you so married that you can't see me looking at you with hungry eyes
Are you so married that you'd deny me just one night in paradise
I wanna hold you I wanna kiss you I wanna love you all I can
I know you're married but I've gotta ask you how married are you Mary Ann
How married are you Mary Ann how much of a chance do I stand
On a scale of one to ten how married are you Mary Ann
[ ac.guitar ]
Surely surely you can see me trembling trembling to hold you tight
I'm not talking about forever I'm just talking about tonight
I wanna touch you I wanna watch you slip that diamond off of your hand
I know youy're married but I've gotta ask you how married are you Mary Ann
How married are you Mary Ann...
How married are you Mary AnnDear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
"I love you, love you"
I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again?
Keep repeating through again
"I love you, I do love you"
I still recall the thrill, I guess that I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heartMy father's name was Hannibal, Mama was Hanna-Mariah.
Everything we owned got all burned up in the great depression fire
Strip mines and one crop farming drained the green earth dry.
We lost it all till only love was left, and that was the one thing money can't buy.
We're all Dust Bowl Children
Singin' the dust bowl song
Well, the crops won't grow,
And the dust just blows
When the green fields are gone.
When the green grass growing fields are gone.
When the green fields are gone.
When the green grass growing fields are gone.
Well, they said in California, there's work of every kind.
The only job that I got out there was waiting on a welfare line.
Once I had a dollar, once I had a dream.
Now all the work is being done by a big ole machine.
We're all Dust Bowl Children
Singin' the dust bowl song
And the crops won't grow,
And the dust just blows
When the green fields are gone.
When the green grass growing fields are gone.
When the green fields are gone.
When the green grass growing fields are gone.Oh, I was lost in the darkness and I wandered astray
With no one to help me along on my way
Until I heard Jesus callin', sayin' come unto me
And I'm travelin' on and on
Oh Lord, I'm travelin' on by the help of my Savior
I can never astray for Jesus leads the way
And my loved one's awaitin' at the end of my journey, my journey
Oh Lord, I'm travelin' on and on
Oh, I could hear Jesus callin' and His voice sounds so sweet
And I knew that the time would come to me that He'd speak
But these trials are over for He bid me, come home
Now I'm travelin' on and on
Oh Lord, I'm travelin' on by the help of my Savior
I can never astray for Jesus leads the way
And my loved one's awaitin' at the end of my journey, my journey
Oh Lord, I'm travelin' on and on
Oh, the Lord is my savior I will walk with Him each day
He will help and protect me to the end of the way
My journey soon will be over and I'll join a happy band
Now I'm travelin' on and on
Oh Lord, I'm travelin' on by the help of my Savior
I can never astray for Jesus leads the way
And my loved one's awaitin' at the end of my journey, my journey
Oh Lord, I'm travelin' on and onIn my hour of darkness, in my time of need
Oh Lord, grant me vision oh, Lord grant me speed
Once I knew a young man went driving through the night
Miles and miles without a word but just his high beam lights
Who'd have ever thought they'd build such a deadly Denver bend
To be so strong, to take so long as it would till the end
In my hour of darkness, in my time of need
Oh Lord, grant me vision oh, Lord grant me speed
Another young man safely, strummed his silver stringed guitar
And He played to people everywhere some say he was a star
But he was just a country boy, his simple songs confess
And the music he had in him so very few possess
In my hour of darkness, in my time of need
Oh Lord, grant me vision oh, Lord grant me speed
The there was an old man kind and wise with age
And he read me just like a book never missed a page
And loved him like a father, and I loved him like my friend
And I knew his time could shortly come but I did not know just when
In my hour of darkness in my time of need
Oh Lord, grant me vision oh, Lord grant me speed
Oh Lord, grant me vision oh, Lord grant me speedBilly Dalton staggered on the sidewalk someone said he stumbled and he fell
Six squad cars came screamin' to the rescue hauled old Billy Dalton off to jail
Cause the law is for protection of the people rules're rules and any fool can see
We don't need no tramps like Billy Dalton scaring decent folks like you and me no sirree
Charlie Watson wandered like a stranger showin' he had no means of support
Policeman took a look at Charlies pants cuffs hustled Charlie Watson off to court
Cause the law is for protection of the people rules're rules and any fool can see
We don't need no bums like Charlie Watson
Scaring decent folks like you and me no sirree
Homer Lee was nothing but a hippie walking through this world without a care
Then one day six strapping brave policemen held down Homer Lee and cut his hair
Cause the law is for protection of the people rules're rules and any fool can see
We don't need no hairy headed hippie scaring decent folks like you and me no siree
So thank your lucky stars you've got protection walk the line and never mind the cost
And don't wonder who them lawmen were protecting
When they nailed the Savior to the cross
Cause the law is for protection of the people rules're rules and any fool can see
We don't need no little sneaking prophets scaring decent folks like you and me no sirreeGo away from my window leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want babe I'm not the one that you need
You say you're looking for someone never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door but it ain't me babe no no no
It ain't me babe it ain't me you're looking for babe
[ harmonica ]
Go lightly from the ledge babe go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want babe I'll only let you down
You say you're looking for someone who'll promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and even more but it ain't me babe no no no
It ain't me babe it ain't me you're looking for babeTHAT AIN'T A WOMAN'S WAY

RECORDED BY KITTY WELLS
I sat alone at home all weekend waitin' for you to call
But the phone didn't ring and the door didn't knock and I sat there talkin' to the wall
Then today when you did come around it didn't mean nothing to you
You say in your heart you know you love me and I oughta know it too
But that ain't a woman's way baby that ain't a woman's way
A woman has to know she's loved and needed every day
All you wanna do is tease me all you wanna do is play
Breakin' up makin' up stayin' all shakin' up that ain't a woman's way
No that ain't a woman's way
Just today I begged you please let's have a little talk about us
But you said no that you had to go and we ended up having a fuss
If I asked you to give me a ring you probably would on the phone
Sometimes I can't help but think I'd be better off alone
That ain't a woman's way baby...I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
Just a country boy that combed his hair
And put on a shirt his mother made and went on the air
And he shook it like a chorus girl
And he shook it like a Harlem queen
He shook it like a midnight rambler,
Baby,
Like you never seen
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
How he took it all out of black and white
Grabbed his wand in the other hand and he held on tight
And he shook it like a hurricane
He shook it like to make it break
And he shook it like a holy roller, baby
With his soul at stake
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
He was all alone in a long decline
Thinking how happy John Henry was that he fell down and died
When he shook it and he rang like silver
He shook it and he shine like gold
He shook it and he beat that steam drill, baby
Well bless my soul
He shook it and he beat that steam drill, baby
Well bless my soul, what's wrong with me?Baby where are you going now?
Do you ever really know?
Oh you hate to be tied down
But you hate to sleep alone
I bet you still think about me
Yeah I bet you still think about me
Like I think about you
Even when I don't want to
There's just something about you baby
There's nothing that I can do
I think about you, you were always wild and free
I know we couldn't hold on forever, but baby
I bet you still think about me
Are you driving up the coast?
Are you wearing any shoes?
Did you outrun all your ghosts?
Like you were always tryna do...
I bet you still think about me
Yeah I bet you still think about me
Like I think about you
Even when I don't want to
There's just something about you baby
There's nothing that I can do
I think about you, you were always wild and free
I know we couldn't hold on forever, but baby
I bet you still think about me
Like I think about you
Even when I don't want to
There's just something about you baby
There's nothing that I can do
I think about you, you were always wild and free
I know we couldn't hold on forever, but baby
I bet you still think about me
Yeah I bet you still think about me
Yeah I bet you still think about meLittle Tom, what will be your fate'
Little Tom, will you be someone great'
Do you know right from wrong, are they teaching you at home'
Or have they turned you loose to roam Little Tom'
I walked into a cafe and ordered myself something to eat
When a little boy walked in with his shoes half off his feet
He said, 'Buy a paper, Mister,' I said, "How older are you son"
"Seven, sir and when my papers are sold, I'll be on my way home"
"What's your name"
"Thomas but everybody calls me Little Tom
They named me after my daddy but they say, I look like my mom"
"Why it's almost midnight son, you should be home asleep"
"I know it but I wanted to get me a bicycle
And I gotta help mommy buy somethin' to eat
My daddy's pretty mean to us"
And he spends most of his money for wine
And he don't hold a job like most other men
"Cause well, he gets fired all the time"
I said, "Have somethin' to eat
Aren't you hungry"
He said, "I guess a little bit
I believe I have a hamburger and a glass of milk to go with it"
I said, "Is that enough"
He said, "Make it two 'cause I ain't eat since noon"
Where do you live son'
'On Main Street sir
There's six of us livin' in one room'
There's me and my three brothers and my mommy and my dad
But someday, I'm gonna buy mommy a big house
If I have to turn out bad'
My appetite left me
As I sat there watchin' him
And I thought, he's just one of thousands
That's brought up in a home of sin
Where their parents abused their children
And forget to maker the all mankind
And then wondered why there's juvenile delinquency
When they are at fault most of the time
I bit my lip and fought back tears
As I watched the little guy leave the cafe
And I wondered, how many more children
Would be brought up that way
Little Tom, what will be your fate'
Little Tom, will you be someone great'Where you live you say the view is so beautiful
And the astroturf that's on your lawn stays green the whole year around
And the buildings are so tall they almost reach heaven
But do you ever ever hear the robins sing
Do you hear the robins singing in the springtime
While a mockingbird sings his happy song
Is all the beauty in your world this artificial thing
Do you ever ever hear the robins sing
[ ac.guitar ]
Where I live the butterflies still kiss the roses
And forgetmenots still grow along the shady lane
And the weeping willow trees still swaying in the breeze
And often I still hear the robins sing
Do you hear the robins...
Do you ever ever hear the robins singYou're a modern day miracle
Anything but a typical girl
Mona Lisa on a sidewalk stand
Superstar in a common man world
Nothing's been so beautiful
Wanna stop and ask your name
Take a picture of your pretty face
Shout to heaven, steal a kiss
Leave the world at your throne
I want to beg you to be mine for the rest of both our lives
But instead I catch my breath, shake my head, and I walk on
I know I've seen you somewhere before
In my mind behind door number 3
You're a pray you're a gift from god
But theres a bridge I cannot cross
It seems your distant dream
I will never hold you
I wanna stop and ask your name
Take a picture of your pretty face
Shout to heaven, steal a kiss
Leave the world at your throne
I want to beg you to be mine for the rest of both our lives
But instead I catch my breath, shake my head, and I walk on
I put one foot in front of another
I walk on
Knowing there will never be another
I wanna stop and ask your name
Take a picture of your pretty face
Shout to heaven, steal a kiss
Leave the world at your throne
I wanna beg you to be mine for the rest of both our lives
But instead I catch my breath, shake my head, and I walk on
I walk onYou step out the shower, wrapped up in a towel
Take your hairbrush mic, start taking requests
You smile and say baby, do you think that I'm crazy?
I just laugh and say yes
Crazy 'bout horses and wrap around porches
Crazy 'bout Strait singing fool hearted memory
Crazy 'bout waking up, four A.M. making love
Then falling right back asleep
Yeah, you're crazy, the same kind of crazy as me
We're late for the party
You're back where you started
Changing your clothes for the thirteenth time
I say you look amazing
You say, no I look crazy
I smile and say maybe you're right
Crazy 'bout horses and wrap around porches
Crazy 'bout Strait singing fool hearted memory
Crazy 'bout waking up, four A.M. making love
Then falling right back asleep
Yeah, you're crazy, the same kind of crazy as me
Ah ooh
You give me a kiss in the light of the moon
Ah ooh
Then you whisper, you know you're crazy too
Crazy 'bout horses and wrap around porches
Crazy 'bout Strait singing damn near anything
Crazy 'bout waking up, four A.M. making love
Then falling right back asleep
Yeah, you're crazy, the same kind of crazy as me
The same kind of crazy as me (ah ooh)
Yeah, baby, you're crazy as me (ah ooh)

HooLast week he spent
His whole pay check on whiskey
I know Friday night he'll do it all again
Oh he'll drink till he falls down
Then he'll order one more round
And then go home with that bottle in his hand
And the only thing I can hold on to
Is this bottle in my hand
I know I'll never have to share it
With any other man
I'm so glad you introduced us
And I'll do the best I can
To be faithful to this bottle in my hand
She told George that changing diapers
Could sure become a drag
And to clean the house and cook for him
Was not her kind of bag
She said he needed someone
Who would love and understand
Then she left him with that bottle in his hand
And the only thing I can count on now
Is this bottle in my hand
I know I'll never have to share it
Oh with any other man
And I'm so glad you introduced us
Oh I'll do the best I can
To be faithful to this bottle in my hand
Yes we'll be faithful to this bottle in our handBaby why you wanna cry?
You really oughta know that I
Just have to walk away sometimes
We're gonna do what lovers do
We're gonna have a fight or two
But I ain't ever changin' my mind
Crazy girl, don't you know that I love you?
And I wouldn't dream of goin' nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like crazy, girl
Wouldn't miss a single day
I'd probably just fade away
Without you, I'd lose my mind
Before you ever came along
I was living life all wrong
Crazy girl, don't you know that I love you?
And I wouldn't dream of goin' nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like crazy, girl

Crazy girl, don't you know that I love you?
And I wouldn't dream of goin' nowhere

And I wouldn't dream of goin' nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you

Wanting me to be one more mistake to make
A bridge to burn to get to someone knew pass me by if you're only passing through
Oh you sure look like the traveling kind to me
Don't stop if this ain't where you wanna be
I don't know what you think you've run into pass me by if you're only passing through
I'm not gonna be your stepping stone among the other hearts that you've walked on

Hey pass me by if you're only passing throughI heard the door slam, and I couldn't tell
Was it just the wind, or was she mad again? (aww hell)
She's gettin' in her car. I hollar "Baby, is there something wrong?"
Thought I heard her say something sounding like "I'm gone".
But these days gone can mean so many things.
There's gone for good, and there's good and gone
And there's gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear.
Well, there's gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dod' gone life.
Is it a whiskey night, or just a couple beers?
I mean what kinda' gone are we talkin' 'bout here?
Well, it's gettin' dark out, she ain't back yet
Ain't called home, turned off the phone. (aww man)
Ha, this might not be good. I woulda' stopped her when she went to leave
But it didn't call 'cause I didn't really think what I'm thinkin' now.
I'm still not sure what gone is all about.
There's gone for good, and there's good and gone
And there's gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear.
Well, there's gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dod' gone life.
Is it a whiskey night, or just a couple beers?
I mean what kinda' gone are we talkin' 'bout here?
Is it the kinda' gone where she's at her moms?
Coolin' down, she'll come around
Or the kind that says you had your chance
And she ain't comin' back.
There's gone for good, and there's good and gone
And there's gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear.
Well, there's gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dod' gone life.
Is it a whiskey night, or just a couple beers?
I mean what kinda' gone are we talkin' 'bout here?
What kinda' gone are we talkin' 'bout,
What kinda' gone are we talkin' 'bout here?
What kinda' gone.Castles tall
Houses small
Left alone
All fall down
Dreams so clear
Disappear
Without a sound
All fall down
Lovers meet
Lovers quarrel
Lonely boy
Lonely girl
I lost him
And I have found
Dreams like walls
All fall down
All fall down
All fall down
She don't want me to call her
And she's told me not to bother comin' round
All fall down
All fall down
When you take a love for granted like I did
You're bound too see it all fall down
Castles tall

Hope you're having a good time out there
Don't forget the waitresses and a coming up next
We got Sheena on the main stage
Athena on the disco
And don't forget we got
:(chorus) Take it off baby
: Those recliner dancers in the back
: Stick around and get those dollar bills out guys and tip tip tip
Take it off baby
Take it off baby
Well here's how this whole mess got started
Had a stripper at a bachelor party
I knew when she jumped out of that cake
We were meant to be
The next date we both flew off to Vegas
I must have been an ignoramus
I honestly believed that she
Loved me just for me
Oh...wasn't six months it came to an end
I walked out of the courtroom crying
She left with a grin
Cause she got half
And I said "OW!"
I mean dang
That comes to nearly fifty thou
Per date
My butt had never been so chafed
Cause she got half
I wondered if I'd remain lonely
Or would I find my one and only
Then the answer to my prayers
Appeared on my TV
(Call me now)
The cutest little tarot card reader
I knew that I just had to meet her
Then she said it was in the cards
For her to marry me
Oh...wasn't three months later I was in court again
No way she could have predicted
The way it would end
Cause I got half
And she said "OW!"
Two dollars a minute
So everyone call right now
Your
Future awaits
And I will be the next Bill Gates
Cause I get half
Sometimes you're better off as friends
Cause if it ever ends
Then they get half
And you'll say "OW"
So I'm not looking to get married right now
I've
Got a date
With a beautiful Playboy Playmate
Who won't get half
No she won't get halfIt ain't nothin' but a concrete jungle with people packed like sardines
Where everybody's tryin' to live beyond their means
Where all the natives hurry and scurry too and fro
And like a fleas on a puppy dog they got no place to go
I wouldn't live in New York City if they gave me the whole dang town
Talk about a bummer it's the biggest one around
Sodom and Gommorah was tame to what I found
I wouldn't live in New York City if they gave me the whole dang town
Well I ain't seen the sunshine since the day that I arrived
Cause brother I've been busy a tryin' to survive
Nobody knows you've been here till you're six feet under ground
Than you become a statistic if they remember to write you downSleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married?
We'll say no man
But you can do the job
When you're in town
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say Are you married?
We'll say No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderlandOne hour and I'll be leaving you.
I know you're gonna make me blue.
My heart is trembling though and through, 'cause I know very well, I can tell, I can tell this will be my last date with you.
Just can't believe that this could end.
I know I'll never love again.
You'll ask me to be just a friend.
It's as plain as can be.
I can see, I can see this will be my last date with you.
And when you say goodbye, I know I will cry, 'cause I'll know it's my last date with you.
I know you met somebody new.
You'll tell me you and I are through.
My plans and dreams cannot come true.
And when you say goodbye, I know I will cry, 'cause I'll know it's my last date with you.I will see you in the morning
When the moonlight leaves the trees
But I will always feel the embers
Of the flames in Tennessee
I was sleeping when they came knocking
They said boy you better leave
Said South Nashville is rocking
And they can't get no relief
So I run and put my pants on
And I run to get my car
But the flames they was a rising
And I didn't get to far
There was a black man on the corner
He said boy just turn away
I got a gun here in my pocket
And I will take your life away
So I showed the man your picture
And I said we had a son
And I was just up here from Texas
I wasn't hurting anyone
So I run out to the highway
And I finally caught a ride
With some white trash outta towner
With his wife and kids inside
So I sit here on the roadside
And I talk to your machine
I can see the flames a rising
Over Nashville Tennessee
Well, don't go out looking on your TV
They gonna keep this all discreet
They will never tell the secrets
Of the flames in Tennessee
You know I hope she don't discover
That this all was all just a lie
But If I don't get home to see her
Then my heart will surely die
I will see you in the morning
When the moonlight leaves the trees
But I will always feel the embers
Of The flames in Tennessee
The night they burned down Nashville TennesseeYou've got that look of almost crying in your eyes once again I almost made you cry
Bitter words were spoken and your heart was almost broken
Angry words that often make love die
But if we'll forgive each other one more time
If you'll let me take you in these arms of mine
To keep tears from your eyes I'll apologize with every single word my heart can find
Hold that tear wait right here till I find the words to tell you
That will keep your heart from breaking that will stop your eyes from crying
Hold that tear don't cry and I'll swear if you'll just try
That you'll never have to cry over me
Hold that tear don't cry...Blue railroad train, goin' down the railroad track
It makes me feel so dog-gone blue, to listen to that old smoke stack
Come back again, let me hear your whistle blow
You're takin' the sun, and leavin' the rain, and makin' me want to go
I've got the blues, longin' for her company
It's many miles from where I am, to the only one for me
Well, it's lonesome here, waiting for the manifest
I hope that engineer is kind enough to let me be his guest
And I'm not as bad, as you might think I am
Though I've traveled here, or hobo'ed there
Rambled these states around
Blue railroad train, a good old pal to me
You take me where, I want to go, I get my transportation's freeHe's wrinkled and gray but he's still got the fire
And he sings on the stage like a bird on a wire
He'll pack 'em in just like he always did
Everybody loves The Honky Tonk Kid
He got his first guitar when he was fifteen
Thirstin' for knowledge, all hungry and green
Strummin' that six string just like Lefty did
Everybody loves The Honky Tonk Kid
[Chorus:]
Well the Honky Tonk Kid loves a honky tonk crowd
He picks them up when this world gets them down
All the smoke and the neon keep his pain here
Nobody knows The Honky Tonk Kid
Ten million fans and a hand full of friends
He'll go home alone when each night ends
He'll think about her and he'll twist off the lid
Cause nobody loves The Honky Tonk Kid
[Chorus: x2]
It won't be long the lord will take him away
He'd sung his last song, they'll place a reef on his grave
But he'll draw a crowd just like he always did
One last goodbye for The Honky Tonk KidOur little boy is four years old and quite a little man
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand
Like T-O-why or maybe S-you-are-P-are-I-S-E
But the words we're hiding from him now
Tear the heart right out of me
Our D-I-V-O-are-see-E becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-are-see-E
Watch him smile, he thinks it's Christmas
Or his 5th Birthday and he thinks see-you-S-T-O-D-why spells fun or play
I spell out all the hurtin' words and turn my head when I speak
'Cause I can't spell away this hurt that's drippin' down my cheek
Our D-I-V-O-are-see-E becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-are-see-ESometimes my head is harder than a mule's
Around my friends, I'm a certified fool
But I'd walk through fire if you asked me to
That's what you love about me lovin' you
[Chorus]
If it rains, if it shines
Every day of your life
And I'll be faithful an' true
That's what you love about me lovin' you
Everybody thinks, I'm tougher than nails
That I never ever need anyone else
But late at night, it's you that I'll turn to
That's what you love about me lovin' you
[Chorus]
When the weight of your world is too much to bear
Lean on me, I'll always be there
You'll never see a hard time that we won't get through
That's what you love about me lovin' you
[Chorus]
Lovin' youWhen the sun comes up and it's time to get up in the mornin'
Will you think of me and how it ought a be in the mornin'
Well I don't know why you could say goodbye
And I can't see how you could be anywhere but here with me in the mornin'
Where was I when you made your move to go away
Where was I I didn't hear the things I've always heard or always said
Well it's no lie I never thought about it not a day
And I'll tell you why I really thought we always tried to say what should be said
When the sun comes upshe walked through the park in the dark
her best friend was her own heart beat
with every little step she'd take
she'd get one step closer to leaving
sitting in her kitchen at night
she listened to the washing machine
just wishing that she could leave
but there were so many loads to clean
she could hear it in her head sometimes
like the change that she was saving in a jar
and the chains on the front porch swing
were creaking like steps in the dark
one day soon this is all gonna end
one day soon maybe it'll all begin
He'd tell it to her all the time
he was the best thing she'd ever see
oh he was stomping up and down the hall
but she could still hear the washing machine
she could hear it in her head sometimes
like the change that she was saving in a jar
and the chains on the front porch swing
were creaking like steps in the dark
one day soon this is all gonna end
one day soon maybe it'll all begin
what a fine mess
pretty fine indeed
but it's just too much for me
for me and my washing machineJust between the two of us, we know our love is gone
People think it's wonderful our love can be so true
You never say an angry word no matter what I do
And you have so much faith in me you trust me anywhere
But the reason if they only knew is that we just don't care
Just between the two of us, let's give up this fantasy
For we no longer care enough to even disagree
Everybody envies us and the way we get along
But just between the two of us, we know our love is gone
Wish we could go back again to days that used to be
We fought a lot but even then I knew you cared for me
Now we get along so well no teardrops ever fall
But there's no love, no anything, there's nothing left at all
Just between the two of us, let's give up this fantasy
For we no longer care enough to even disagree
Everybody envies us and the way we get along
But just between the two of us, we know our love is goneEverybody, sings a differnt kind of song
All God's children have somewhere they belong
Oh I've heard it said, I know it must be true
We were meant to be, I'm made for loving you
Everybody, has something he must be
Call it fortune or just call it destiny
I have spent my life making my way to you
See the way we fit, I'm made for loving you
Like blue skies always sing your name with sunshine
And just like lauughter goes along with good times
I have spent my life making my way to you
See the way we fit, I'm made for loving you
Girl, I've spent my life making my way to you
See the way we fit, I'm made for loving youYou can't mix angels and alcohol
I don't think God meant for them to get along
When it takes control, you can't love no one at all
You can't mix angels and alcohol
You can't blend whiskey with a good woman's love
They don't go together, love's already hard enough
You think you can handle, how it feels or what it does
You can't blend whiskey with a good woman's love
You can't change lonely with a bottle of wine
It might ease the heartache for one short easy time
In the end you have to face what's hiding in your mind
You can't change lonely with a bottle of wine
You can't mix angels and alcohol
An angel once loved me, I traded it all
I let the bottle drive my life into a wall
You can't mix angels, and alcoholCoffee keeps me up and I can't sleep
And when I drink too much then I can't eat
Losing you has led me to believe
Everything I love is killin' me
Everything I love is killin' me
Cigarettes, Jack Daniels and caffeine
And that's the way you're turnin' out to be
Everything I love gonna have to give up
Cause everything I love is killin' me
I guess I made a big mistake
Thinkin' you're a habit I can break
Well, I'm addicted to you now I see
Everything I love is killin' me
Everything I love is killin' me
Cigarettes, Jack Daniels and caffeine
And that's the way you're turnin' out to be
Everything I love gonna have to give up
Cause everything I love is killin' me
Everything I love gonna have to give up
Cause everything I love is killin' meI close my eyes and I listen
And try to get out of the way
But when I look out the window
I see his face
Is it him that I hear laughing
Taunting me making me blush
Acting like he knows my secrets
Why won't he hush
The crow in the yard is trying to tell me something
I see him out there trying to catch my eye
He's not the magnificent raven
He caws a much creepier caw
So comfortable there in his murder
Don't he know it all
So why won't he just give me the message
What's the worst news he could bring
And I make a mess when I'm guessing
About anything
The crow in the yard is trying to tell me something
I see him out there trying to catch my eye
Black as the night he shines like a light on nothing
Ain't no use in trying to hide
Oh child
Oh child
Oh child
I guess a crow in the yard
Is better than bats in the belfryWhile drinking alone in a Tavern one day
My eyes they harldy could see
I heard a kind voice ringing so loud and clear
And here's what the voice said to me
[Chorus]
Go home, go home and kneel by your bedside and pray
Go home, go home God will answer your prayers today
I staggered across the room to the door,
I almost fell on the floor,
I'm sure there was laughter but I could not hear,
For the the words that still ring in my head,
[Chorus]
God sobered my mind and saved my soul
And erased my thoughts from all fears
And back to the Tavern I preached of these words
The words that still rang in my ears
[Chorus]
The crowd started leaving with head bowed so low
As the Bartender picked up the key
As he locked the door, he murmured these words
Was the same words that God spoke to me.
[Chorus]Don't look inside
No, don't look there
'Cause you might find
Yourself somewhere
Walkin' 'round
Lost and alone
Without one clue
That it's a long way home
Years and years
Is a lot of time
To drag your heart across
Every rock you find
Hate is deep
And its pull is strong
But the passion's short
Then it's a long way home
I can't take
One single step for you
But I might just help
To find some
small pathway through
Don't look back
'Cause you might see
Just how far
All that used to be
Just let your mind
Think on what's gone
And then you'll know
That it's a long way home
Yeah, you'll know
That it's a long way home
You'll find out
That it's a long way home
There ain't no doubt
That it's a long way homeHometown crowd, Friday night lights

Now cups are raising, flags are waving
He's on their shoulders, famous
Here's one for the underdogs

They say for every boy and girl there's just one love in this old world
And I know I've found mine
The heavenly touch of your embrace tells me no one can take your place
Ever in my heart
Young love first love filled with true devotion
Young love our love we share with deem emotion
[ ac.guitar ]
Just one kiss from your sweet lips will tell me that your love is real
And I can feel that it's true
We will vow to one another that there'll never be any other
Love for you or for me
Young love first love...
Young loveWell if you ask me where I come from
Here's what I tell everyone:
I was born by God's dear grace
In an extraordinary place
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly
It's a big ol' land with countless dreams
Happiness ain't out of reach
Hard work pays off the way it should
Yeah, I've seen enough to know that we've got it good
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly
There's a lady that stands in a harbor
For what we believe
And there's a bell that still echoes
The price that it cost to be free
I pledge allegiance to this flag
And if that bothers you, well that's too bad
But if you got pride and you're proud you do
Hey, we could use some more like me and you
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly
Yes, there's a lady that stands in a harbor
For what we believe
And there's a bell that still echoes
The price that it cost to be free
No, it ain't the only place on earth
But it's the only place that I prefer
To love my wife and raise my kids
Hey, the same way that my daddy did
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle flyChorus:
Running in the fast lane, movin' on through
Doin' the best that I can, just to get home to you
I've got my radar lookin' for trouble ahead
Running in the fast lane, looking for my bed
Life out on this highway gets me weary to the bone
I feel like some ole cowboy, who was born to be alone
You told me just last evening you're so tired of telephones
You need someone to hold you, so I best just bring it home
Chorus
It's never I don't miss you, when it's good or when it's bad
I love what we've got going, and all the things we've had
But you've got to make a living, keeping up and keeping on
Sometimes it's just a living, when you've been gone too longI fall to pieces each time I see you again
I fall to pieces how can I be just your friend
You want me to act like we've never kissed
You want me to forget pretend we've never met
And I've tried how I've tried but I haven't yet you walk by and I fall to pieces
I fall to pieces each time someone speaks your name
I fall to pieces time only adds to the flame
You tell me to find someone else to love
Someone who'll love me too the way you used to do
But each time I go out with someone new you walk by and I fall to pieces
You walk by and I fall to piecesIf you don't want me baby if you're not satisfied
If you don't care get on your horse and ride ride ride
Since you've got on your high horse those fancy friends you've found
You have a hard time seein' me you're always looking down
If you don't want me baby...
You talked about me honey you tried to tear me down
But while you're throwin' dirt at me you're only losing ground
If you don't want me baby...
[ steel ]
If you don't want me baby...
I'll have your second fiddle returned to you today
Cause baby that's one instrument that I'd never played
If you don't want me baby...
If you don't want me baby...

They got a road out in Alaska now,
I hear that you can go there.
Tell me about Montana,
With the cool blue mountain air.
I know your honeys got the money,
I can understand your wanderlust.
Brother, and boy, for me these days,
Its refrigerator or bust.
I ain't got no words for going,
I got no longing for your open road.
Don't get found rollin' into town tugging on a heavy load.
You've gotta give me the nights with the city lights, and the people buzzin' everywhere.
One hand upon the parking meter, the other on her easy chair.
I'll send her roses, send her roses everyday.
If I don't go down another dirt road, I don't think it's gonna hurt my day.
I'll send her roses, send her roses once in awhile.
I'm a long, long way from outta here, but you know I'm gonna go in style.
Well, I was rollin' around Boston town, wasn't hardly anybody I know.
Got to singin' low for the first three rows, puttin' on a lousy show.
Well then I met her, I had to let her buy my lunch, I got the flowery plate.
I'm telling you why, good brother don't laugh, think I got me one suitable mate.
I'll send her roses, send her roses every day.
If I don't go down another dirt road, I don't think it's gonna hurt my day.
I'll send her roses, send her roses by the dozen.
I've been having me a whirl with a pretty girl,
And she told me she liked my lovin'.
(repeat last bridge)I am a soldier I'm a slave of power
Power so great that it can destroy God's world with one mighty blast
I'm a machine a computer an engine programed to reap destruction wherever I go
I'm a bad risk for my credit is only backed up by the United States Government
My reputation is that of a braggard a sex fied a cheat and rusted hero
I'm a killer paid and trained to hit first before being hit and I do
I'm a soldier so who cares how dirty the job is if it has to be done then it's done
Right but I'm also a human being I am myself good or bad
I smell the flowers in the spring I hear the birds sing in the early morning
I feel the warmth of a fire in the winter and I feel the rain as it moinstens my brow
I'm a part of family with God as my father and me the obediest child
I have wants and needs and I have the strength and the faith to fullfill them
And I have passion the kind of passion that brings forth a love so great
That no war no tragedy or no other being could ever destroy
I'm a human being and I feel I feel the things all around me
And I'm grateful I'm so very grateful
I'm also an American and I'm proud
I'm proud because I have the right to worship God as my Master
The right to love a wife children mother and father
Without the fear of political reprisal
My country gives me the right to build to destroy
And to rebuild to better proportisions
I am an American I have the right to listen the Star Spangled Banner
The right to feel a chill throughout my entire body when I look at the flag our flag
I have the right to defend to honor to pay tribute
To the great ones who've come and gone before why
Because I'm an American and because I'm an American I can also cry
I can cry for my lost brother who died defending our way of life
I am an American and I'm proud proud because I ampapa's in the parlor

It takes a worried man...
I went across the river to lay me down to sleep
I went across the river to lay me down to sleep
I went across the river gonna me down to sleep
I woke up and I had shackles on my feet
It takes a worried man...
[ guitar ]
I asked the judge what's gonna be my fine I asked the judge what's gonna be my fine
I said old judge what's gonna be my fine twenty-one days on the Rocky Island Line
It takes a worried man...Gather round boys and a tale I will tell about Joade the rodeo clown
This happy feller keep the cowboys together after they hit the ground
He once was a fighter and a saddle bronc rider and all around hell of a hand
But a bull got him down away from the clown he lived but not ride again
But rodeo was burned deep in his soul and his heart just wouldn't let go
He didn't want cowboys hooked by the bulls so he took to clowin' the show
With grease paint and red nose and baggy old clothes
His track shoes barreled and bloomed
He earned his keep a fightin' the bulls and savin' us hard ridin' fools
I was down in the well and hung in my rope in a show in old west Texas town
The man who saved me from chain and hells was Joade the rodeo clown
The bull gored old Joade with his terrible old horns
Then stomped and mauled him around
One of my buddies dragged me away but Joade lay dead on the ground
The preacher they found for the funeral well he didn't have a whole lot to say
He didn't know Joade or about rodeo life so all he could do was to pray
There's many a cowboy that owes him his life and the children all loved him too
There were lines on his face and each one was a trace
Of the laughter the miles and the blues
So barkeep get with it and set em up again I'm buyin' this next round
And if there's any man here who can't drink to old Joade
Then he better just get the hell outYou emptied all my pockets you took away my gold
You stripped me of my innocence and left me in the cold
You robbed me of my patience
And you messed up my mind
But we're gonna stick together babe cause a truer love you'll never find than mine
You set my very soul on fire and burned it to the ground
You took my lovely little world and turned it upside down
You robbed me of my patience
And you messed up my mind
But we're gonna stick together babe cause a truer love you'll never find than mine
But we're gonna stick together babe cause a truer love you'll never find than mineYou call me up
You ain't even gotta say a single word cause I already know
It's been one of those days honey something got you stirred up
Weighing down like an anchor that you gotta drag around
But I know just what you need
[Chorus]
And I'll be home soon
To kiss away the world burn
Your troubles down
I'm gonna make you forget
When I'm holding you
There's only room for us nothing else allowed
Tell all your worries there ain't much time left
It's time to go cause I'll be home soon
Yeah I'm running reds, so I can run my fingers through
Your hair girl I can feel it now and I'm coming for you honey
You can lay it on me, every care
Baby call and I'll be there to catch you
I'm on my way
And I'll be home soon
To kiss away the world burn
Your troubles down
I'm gonna make you forget
When I'm holding you
There's only room for us nothing else allowed
Tell all your worries there ain't much time left
It's time to go cause I'll be home soon
Awww yeah
And I'll be home soon
To kiss away the world burn
Your troubles down
I'm gonna make you forget
When I'm holding you
There's only room for us nothing else allowed
Tell all your worries there ain't much time left
It's time to go cause I'll be home soon
Yeah
Awww yeah
I'll be home soon
You call me up
You ain't even gotta say a single word
I already know
She was singin' ?Love Me Tender? at the local karaoke
I knew right then and there I had found my one and only
She takes my breath away every time I see her
I just couldn't wait for all my boys to meet her
She's got season tickets and sweet, pouty lips
She's all that, well equipped
She's all that, she loves to ride in my pickup truck
She's all that, Mom and Daddy can't believe my luck
She's all that, she looks so good we never wait in line
She's all that, she's all mine
She can throw a split finger and she's got her own glove
When she sinks a twenty footer, man i know I'm in love
Saturday night, she's like a time bomb tickin'
She looks better on Sunday than Mama's fried chicken
She only gets mad when she misses sportscenter
She's all that, even tempered
She's all that, she swings a nine handicap
She's all that, she looks sexy in a baseball cap
She's all that, she makes me want to lay it all on the line
She's all that, she's all mine
Whoa she's a perfect combination
Whoo, she got my defense off the field
Oh, every day's an education
She's got my head a spinnin' like a spoke inside a wheel
She's all that, I'm in touch with her feminine side
She's all that, let me tell you, man, it's one sweet ride
She's all that, a hum-dinger, boy, straight off the blocks
No doubt about it that girl rocks
She's all that, the girl is all that
She's all that, the girl is all that
She's all that, the girl is all that
Going home to baby sure is fine
She's all that, she's all mine
She's all that, she's all mine
She's all that, she's all mine
She's all that, she's all mine
She's all thatWhoa whoa
She's got Brazilian leather boots on the pedal of her German car
Listen to the Beatles singin' 'Back in the U-S-S-R'
Yeah she's goin' around the world tonight
But she ain't leavin' here
She's just going to meet her boyfriend down at the street fair
It's a French kiss, Italian ice
Spanish moss in the moonlight
Just another American Saturday night
There's a big toga party tonight down at Delta Chi
They've got Canadian bacon on they're pizza pie
They've got a cooler full of cold Coronas and Amstel Light
It's like were all livin' in a big ol' cup
Just fire up the blender, mix it all up
It's a French kiss, Italian ice
Margaritas in the moonlight (whoa)
Just another American Saturday night
You know everywhere there's something they're known for
Although usually it washes up on our shores
My great great great granddaddy stepped off of that ship
I bet he never ever dreamed we'd have all this
You know everywhere has somethin' they're known for
Although usually it washes up on our shores
Little Italy, and Chinatown, sittin' there side by side
Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!
It's a French kiss, Italian ice,
Spanish moss in the moonlight
Just another American, just another American,
Its just another American Saturday nightI've been walking these mean streets
Hard concrete beneath my feet
Ain't found a friendly face among the crowd
The city's like a Christmas tree
A light for every dreamer's dream
But it seems mine has finally burned out
[Chorus]
Long black train, take me home
I've worn out my welcome here, it's time to go
I have to face the music, this just ain't where I belong
Long black train, take me home
I should've known I was mistaken
When I thought that I'd be making
A name for myself in Babylon
Though I've tried to do my best
The suit and ties are not impressed
So with what's left of my pride, I'll carry on
[Chorus]
I'm gonna trade my guitar for a ticket
Then climb aboard and ride you down the track
I know I'm licked, but it's hard to admit it
Maybe someday you can bring me back
[Chorus]
Long black train, take me homeSame old place
Same old city
What can I do?
I'm falling in love
I'm just an old hound dog
Roaming around, oh Lord
I've got all this and Heaven above
Oh, Atlanta
I hear you calling
I'm coming back to you one fine day
No need to worry
There ain't no hurry cause I'm
On my way back to Georgia
On my way back to Georgia
I get a feeling in me
When I remember all those crazy days and crazier nights
Can't you hear the music playing?
You must have heard them saying
We're gonna rip 'em up and light up the night
Oh, Atlanta
I hear you calling
I'm coming back to you one fine day
No need to worry
There ain't no hurry cause I'm
On my way back to Georgia
On my way back to Georgia
Same old place
It's the same old city
What can I do?
I'm falling in love
I'm just an old hound dog
Roaming around, Lord, Lord
I've got all this and Heaven above
Oh, Atlanta
I hear you calling
I'm coming back to you one fine day
No need to worry
There ain't no hurry cause I'm
On my way back to Georgia
On my way back to Georgia
Oh, Atlanta
Hear me calling
I'm coming back to you one fine day, hey
No need to worry
There ain't no hurry cause I'm
On my way back to Georgia
On my way back to GeorgiaAlright bro
We're gonna have a talk about this
I brought you in this club and you done stole my girl
And that ain't right
When we walked into the club I thought it was understood, mmm, hmm
It was my turn tonight and it was your job to make me look good
Then I pointed out that sweet little beauty in black, yes I did
I sent you over with a couple of drinks and you never came back
[Chorus]
You were supposed to be my wingman
Wasn't that your game plan
You take the grenade, and I'll take the fox
Supposed to talk me up bro
No matter what so
Don't go tellin' me you must've forgot
You waltzed her off the dance floor
Right out the back door
Leaving me to go it alone
You're supposed to be my wingman
But the only thing that it should've been me
That's taking her home
Shortly after you left, I was cussing your name, hell I was
When her ugly girlfriend comes over starts working her game, mmm
And I couldn't scare her off no matter what I'd said, nah, no
I was thinkin' I'm the one that should be kissing on that cutie instead
[Chorus]
You were supposed to be my wingman
Wasn't that your game plan
You take the grenade, and I'll take the fox
Supposed to talk me up bro
No matter what so
Don't go tellin' me you must've forgot
You waltzed her off the dance floor
Right out the back door
Leaving me to go it alone
You're supposed to be my wingman
But the only thing that it should've been me
That's taking her home
Whoa
They say, all is fair in love and war
And all in time I'm gonna settle that score
It ain't win or lose, it's how you play the game
If I was in your shoes, I might've done it just the same
[Chorus]
You were supposed to be my wingman
Wasn't that your game plan
You take the grenade, and I'll take the fox
Supposed to talk me up bro
No matter what so
Don't go tellin' me you must've forgot
You waltzed her off the dance floor
Right out the back door
Leaving me to go it alone
You're supposed to be my wingman
But the only thing that it should've been me
That's taking her home
You waltzed her off the dance floor
Right out the back door
Leaving me to go it alone
You're supposed to be my wingman
But the only thing man it should've been me
That's taking her home
Is taking her home, ohh
You were supposed to be my wingman, mmm, mmmThere's a tyre on the rope above the swimming hole
Where Danny and Dave and Tim would go
Make up stories 'bout girls they know
Brothers and best friends
Now the dam's dried up and the rope is frayed
Danny and Dave they ran away
Timmy he just had to stay
'Cause he's the last man standing on this ground
He was raised on this land and he ain't leaving now
All the other boys have packed up and gone
Leaving him to carry on
"Cause he's the last man standing
Mama took a job at the General Store
Timmy built a ramp from the front porch door
"Cause Daddy can't do much round here anymore
He just sits and stares
And it breaks his heart not to lend a hand
He says "There's too much work for just one man"
Timmy says "Dad don't you understand?"
"Cause I'm the last man standing on the ground
I was raised on this land and I won't let you down
All your other boys have packed up and gone
You can count on me to carry on
"Cause I'm the last man standing
Sometimes late at night he dreams
Of places he won't see
But he says "All they've got is me"
Now he's the last man standing on this ground
He was raised on this land and he ain't leaving now
All the other boys have packed up and gone
Leaving him to carry on
He's the last man standing on this ground
He won't let his mama and his daddy down
All the other boys have packed up and gone
They can count on him to carry on
"Cause he's the last man standing.HOLD EVERYTHING
Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone
Don't be tempted by their money and booze
Nobody's gonna fill my shoes.
When I get back I won't even knock
'Cause the same ole keys fits the same ole locks
Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone.
Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone
Don't try to sell our little shack
Just keep it till I get back.
Just keep everything in apple shape
If you feel to quessy put on the brake
Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone.
Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone
Just meet 'em at the door with a 44
And tell 'em I'm right next door.
If they ask you for a date just show 'em they gate
And if they don't like it tell them your to late
Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone.
Hold everything I'm a-comin' home
No matter how far I roam
When I return we're gonna be alone
You'll forget I've ever been gone.
When I get back you won't sleep
And you won't have much time to eat
Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone...They were quite a pair
The way that love should be
They still held hands
For the world to see
She's thankful that she had him
All those years
But she still has days
She can't hold back the tears
She misses their Monday night bowling league
When they'd wear their matching shirts
She misses their Wednesday night dinner out
As soon as he got home from work
And Saturday morning sleeping late
Holding each other close
But she misses him on Sunday the most
She sits alone on that same old pew again
His tenor voice still echoes now and then
It brings back all those memories
Of him there by her side
What she'd give for one more Sunday drive
She misses their Monday night bowling league
When they'd wear their matching shirts
She misses their Wednesday night dinner out
As soon as he got home from work
And Saturday morning sleeping late
Holding each other close
But she misses him on Sunday the most
But she misses him on Sunday the mostYour eyes are the eyes of a woman in love
And though how they give you away
Why try to deny your a woman in love
When I know very well would I see
I see no moon in the sky
Ever lent such a glow
Some flame deep within made them shine
Those eyes are the eyes of a woman in love
And may they gaze ever more into mine
Crazily gaze ever more into mine
Those eyes are the eyes of a woman in love
And may they gaze ever more into mine
Crazily gaze ever more into mineWHAT IS LIFE WITHOUT LOVE
Writers Eddy Arnold, Vic McAlpin, Owen Bradley
What is life without love
What is love without you
Why dream if they never come true
Why try to go on
When your only hopes are gone
Darlin', what is life without love?
Somehow I can't forget
The first day that we met
You were something from heaven above
Now I'm asking you sweetheart
And it's straight from my heart
Darlin', what is life without love?
All alone how I yearn
That someday you'll return
And be true as the stars up above
If you'll only say you'll try
Then I'll be satisfied
Darlin', what is life without love?
What is life without love
What is love without you
Why dream if they never come true
Why try to go on
When your only hopes are gone
Darlin' what is life without love?One heart is beatin' the other one's cheatin'
That's the way it always seems to be
In one heart there's romance
The other there is no chance
Two hearts can't be in love and disagree
I gave my heart while you played around
My love you desired
Till another heart you've found
Now one heart is beatin' the other one's cheatin'
You can't have a cheatin' heart and win
One heart is beatin' the other one's cheatin'
That's the way it always seems to beI'm through playin' it safe
It's time I laid it on the line
I want to dance out on the edges
And get a little reckless in my mind
Cause even a heart that's locked away
Can find a way to break
I won't hide it now
I'm through makin' that mistake
One fall, that's all
I don't know who it's gonna be
Out there, somewhere
Someone is waitin' just for me
No pain, no gain
There's not a chance that I won't take
Cause love is always worth the ache
Love's like a Vegas wheel
You've got to spin to win the prize
(you know you got to, you know you got to,
you know you got to spin to win the prize)
But it's a gamble worth the takin'
You say a prayer and then you roll the dice
(you say a prayer and, you say a prayer
and, you say a prayer and, and you roll the dice)
Well they say it's hard to beat the odds
I say it's harder not to try
I will play the game
Do what it takes to get it right
One fall, that's all
I don't know who it's gonna be
Out there, somewhere
Someone is waiting just for me
No pain, no gain
There's not a chance that I won't take
Cause love is always worth the ache
Well they say it's better to have loved and lost
Then to have never loved at all
Ah yeah yeah yeah
One fall, that's all
I don't know who it's gonna be
Out there, somewhere
Someone is waiting just for me
No pain, no gain
There's not a chance that I won't take
Cause love is always worth the ache
(It's always, it's always, it's always)
Yeah it's always worth the ache
(It's always, it's always, it's always)
Oh love is worth the ache
(It's always, it's always, it's always)
Yeah love is always worth the ache
(It's always, it's always, it's always)
Yeah
Cause love is always worth the acheI remember hearin' Hank on the radio
The first time it felt like fallin' in love
I bought a cassette, stole some Reds from Dad
And me and ol' Junior just burned it up
I was hooked like a fish
Every birthday wish was guitars and records
Now honey I know you miss me
I feel it when you kiss me
Trust me when I say every goodbye hurts
Well, damn these dreams
Playin' my heart just like a guitar string
Pull me away from you and everything I really need
Well, damn these dreams
Chasin' that same old whiskey melody
All up and down these Nashville streets
It's hard to look true love in the eye and leave
Well, damn these dreams
Well, I remember hearin' my song on the radio
The first time it felt like some kinda drug
Out there on the road playing show after show
Me and the boys just burnin' it up
It was all fun and games 'til the little ones came
'Cause it makes my heart bleed
When I gotta drive away and listen to 'em say
Hey daddy, why you gotta go, please don't leave
Well, damn these dreams
Playin' my heart just like a guitar string
Pullin' me away from you and everything I really need
Well, damn these dreams
Chasin' that same old whiskey melody
All up and down every small town street
It's hard to look true love in the eye and leave
Well, damn these dreams
Well, damn these dreams
Well, it's in my heart and it's in my soul
And just like you, I never can let go
These wheels just gotta roll
'Cause I remember hearin' Hank on the radio
The first time it felt like fallin' in loveWalking down the highway
Looking for a place to lay down my tired and weary bones
Sun came up this morning, another day to face
Everything reminds me that you're gone
The leaves on the trees are starting to fall
Summer has sang its final song
Off in the distance I hear a lonely call
Everything reminds me that you're gone
The grass in the meadow is turning the ground
Listen to that cold wind moan
The snowflakes of winter will soon be on the ground
Everything reminds me that you're gone, uh huhParody of "Man Of Constant Sorrow" (Traditional)

Uh yessir do you have Man of Constant Borrow by Cledus T. Judd
No sir somebody's already borrowed it
Constantly borrows everything
I'm the man of constant borrow
There's nothing I can call my own
Some may try to say it's all stolen
I prefer permanently loaned
He's the biggest mooch we ever known
SOLO
My grass mowin
Bot I've got no mower
My neighbor won't let me use his
I can't really say is though I blame him
Kept it three years last time I did
He thought for sure that it was his
I need a ride down to the pawn shop
Lend me the keys to your Corvette
What do you mean you don't trust me
I never not brought it back yet
I don't think I could take that bet
You know dang well (he's gone away)
Well you may have heard of me

Coming with a new style

When I'm on the mike well you know I'll get hog wild
Comedian
Extrodinaire
A fat Eminem with the bleach blonde hair
I know that you think
I've got your chainsaw
You can't find it anywhere
I can't cut no wood
Since way fore winter
I gave it back to you last fair
Check his garage it's probably there
I sure could use a hundred dollars
I'll gladly pay you back Tuesday
I know that's what I said the last time
You can't believe a word I say
He has no plans to (really???) pay(Chalee Tennison/Dale Dodson/Billy Lawson)
Her little heart beats so fast
You can almost hear it breaking down the hall
As we fight the final round
Sounds like we're tearing down the walls
He packs a bag,screams goodbye
I yell wait, as he walks out the door
Then from the lips of a child I found wisdom
That I've never heard before
She said, Momma let him go
We don't have to pray about that anymore
Momma, pull yourself together, we've all survived the war
She said, Mommalet him go
We don't have to pray about that anymore
That one's been answered, amen, praise the Lord
Yesterday, she was a baby in my arms
Now just look at her, holding me together
As I fall apart
It turned out that the best for her
Wound up to be the best for me
Guess you never get too old to learn
And you can't be too young to teachI heard you've been wondering
How I'm getting along
I guess you think I can't make it with you gone
But I don't want you to worry
Don't you lose any sleep
But a man called long-distance this morning
Said they're thinking about putting me
On the cover of the USA Today
The story of heart-breaking pain
Picture of the loneliest man they claim in the USA Today
I don't sleep in the nighttime
Darkness reminds me of you
I lost eight pounds since last Tuesday
But I could stand to lose a few
I don't believe I'm too bad
People say I look fine
The man from the paper seems happy
Says I'm bigger than the latest crime
On the cover of the USA Today
The story of heart-breaking pain
Picture of the loneliest man they claim in the USA Today
So if you're concerned in trouble
Then you're hurting me
Don't you work out this little thing called losing you
Has made a big man out of me
I'm on the cover of the USA Today
The story of heart-breaking pain
Picture of the loneliest man they claim in the USA TodayWell, I see you still remember our old number
No, there's no one here but me tonight
And I guess you're gonna talk about your problems
In your never-ending search for Mr. Right
Well you say them single bars are awful crowded
With all the fools, the fashions, and the fads
And 'tween the pickup lines, the cheap wine, and the losers
Sometimes you almost want what we once had
Girl, you think you've got it bad
Well, try getting over you
If you want something hard to do
I can't believe you'd call me up
Just to say you've got it rough
Girl, you haven't got a clue
Try getting over you
So it's another Friday night with all its troubles
Where to go and what you're gonna wear
And you've got to pick your lipstick and your high heels
And figure out someway to fix your hair
Lord the burden that you bear
Try getting over you
If you want something hard to do
I can't believe you'd call me up
Just to say you've got it rough
Girl, you haven't got a clue
Try standing in my place
Where the tears roll down your face
Come and take one bitter taste
Of the hell I'm going through
And try getting over you
Try standing in my place
Where the tears roll down your face
Come and take one bitter taste
Of the hell I'm going through
And try getting over you
Try getting over you
Try getting over you
Try it babyNo, she not gone forever
She's just playing one of her games
And tonight when I get home
Everything will be the same.
'Cause when I woke up this morning
Yes, I found her goodbye note
It just a game she's plays
It just a goodbye joke.
She's just goin' downtown shopping
She'll bring me back some sporty clothes
'Cause I'm always on her mind
No matter where she plans to go.
If I thought she was gone forever
Lord, I'd find me a hangin' rope
That's why I'm drifting now
It's just a goodbye joke.
Ain't it funny the sense of humor
A woman can have sometimes
Especially that lovely woman of mine.
Hey, bartender won't you bring me a drink
'Cause I still like [unknown]
On the words she wrote
In her little goodbye joke...Superman (Superman), Superman (Superman), Superman
Now there you go pickin' on me again
Pushin' me to the very e-e-end
Tellin' me to move another mountain
Well just 'cause you can walk on water
And you know son, I can
You know you're mamma should have named you Superman
Superman (Superman), Superman (Superman), Superman
Now let's go through this one more time
You do your thing and I'll do mine
Now honey baby, you've gotta draw the line
Your hangup is messin' with mine
All I can do is the best I can
To change the ways that you can't stand
And if it ain't good enough for superman
He ain't good enough for me
Superman (Superman), Superman (Superman), Superman
So you don't have to rub it in
Just 'cause you're right and I'm wrong again
Sometimes right is just as wrong as wrong is
And I ain't never gonna learn how to make it plain
I wouldn't if I could for all the bull in Spain
But you go right ahead and do it, do it Superman
Superman (Superman), Superman (Superman), Superman
Yeah, let's go through this one more time
You do your thing and I'll do mine
But honey baby, we gotta draw the line
Your hangup is messin' with mine
All I can do is the best I can
To change the ways that you can't stand
And if it ain't good enough for superman
He ain't good enough for mineI gotta get while the gettin's good baby get while the gettin's good
Out of your life into a life where I'll be understood
I need a lots of tender love and your heart's made out of wood
If I'm never gonna find a peace of mind I gotta get while the gettin's good
You told me that love is one big bubble we played the game by your rules and you won
And just today I figured out the trouble I learned to crawl before I learned to run
But I'm gonna get while...
I noticed I've quit singing in the shower I rarely ever laugh and I can tell
I'm willting like the petals on the flowers
And there's nothing left to say now but farewell
And I'm gonna get while...If you have any left of her kisses
When you're through with your latest affair
Don Â¹t let them just waste, I know how they taste
I Â¹ll take anything you can spare
And if you have a few idle moments
If you're lonely and nobody Â¹s there
I'll gladly fill in til you find a new friend
I'll take anything you can spare
Yes, I'll even take some heartaches from you
Though I've already more than my share
I love you all the time, so baby keep me in mind
I'll take anything you can spareYou spread your love like broken glass
Beautiful to see
Lead me down the garden path
Trying to make me bleed
Is that any way to treat your lover
Is that any way to treat your lover
You say I have your heart and soul
And will not be denied
But on those nights I need you so
It's never a good time
Is that any way to treat your lover
Is that any way to treat your lover
Now would the stars ever so ungrateful to the sky
Would the sun ever be too proud to let the moon shine it's light
Would the wind ever be jealous of the breeze
Tell me why do you do these things to me
Tell me why do you do act that way to me
Is that any way to treat your lover
Is that any way to treat your loverWhen I first laid eyes on you
Well, the night just felt so odd
You looked at me and the stars lined up
So I thought I'd heard from God
And I gave him my best shot
Loving you was like throwing a lasso around a tornado
I tried to hold on to you
Took a ride on a tilt-a-whirl that sits on top of the world
Man, I thought I could show you
I've always been afraid of flying
But you can't blame a girl for trying
Felt like a pearl when I was holding your hand
So precious I forgot
You could have any girl but I only wanted one man
And you were everything I'm not
Still I gave it my best shot
Loving you was like throwing a lasso around a tornado
I tried to hold on to you
Took a turn on a high trapeze swinging over the deep
I thought I could show you
I've always been afraid of flying
But you can't blame a girl for trying
Like a vine bends a tree to the ground
I won't hold you down
I tried to climb just as high
But I found all the clouds touch the ground
In this small town
Took a ride on a high trapeze swinging over the deep
I thought I could show you
That I've always been afraid of flying
But you can't blame a girl for trying
No, you can't blame a girl, heyI can tell where this is goin
your kissing me long and slow and soft
Throw the shades and close the curtains
The Lamp on the tables burning
Baby dont turn it off.
Theres no one here, Just you and me alone
and i wanna love you with the lights on
Tonight i wanna see it all
your hair come down and your dress Fall slowly
off your shoulders to the floor
i wanna look into your eyes,
See your breathing see your smile
Take you into my arms and take you nice and slow
Till the want in me is gone
I wanna lay here all night long and love you
With The lights on
Baby, your one sexy lady
You can look at me like im crazy
But you are
It dont make sense to me
Hiding that beautiful body In the dark
Lets take a step out of our comfort zone
and do a little loving with the lights on
Tonight i wanna see it all
your hair come down and your dress Fall slowly
off your shoulders to the floor
i wanna look into your eyes,
See your breathing see your smile
Take you into my arms and take you nice and slow
Till the want in me is gone
I wanna lay here all night long and love you
With The lights on
i wanna look in to your eyes
See your breathing see your smile
Take you into my arms and take you nice and slow
Till the want in me is gone
I wanna lay here all night long and love you
With The lights on
Till the want in me is gone
I wanna lay here all night long and love you
With The lights onCONFESSIONS OF A BROKEN MAN

RECORDED BY PORTER WAGONER
I'm just askin' you to listen not to understand these confessions of a broken man
I don't know where my story starts or I'd go back to them
All I know it's a sad sad tale so for it has no end
I know I drank too much though I didn't take thirst
Oh I'd have a beer or two and it just seemed to go from bad to worse
Then one day I noticed my money was goin' out faster than it was comin' in
And I got scared and I started gamblin' and I'm the kind that just never seems to win
I had a woman guess every man does and every man thinks his is the best mine was
Stuck by me through thick and thin till it just got too thin I guess
She walked in one day and said she had believed me
I could've sworn I saw big tear in her eye
I heard the other day that she got married again I hope he treats her better than I
Well if you get me idea that I'm some son of a bum you're catchin' on pretty fast
And if you wonder if I've turned into a wino
For these are all my fingerprints on this glass
I've been sittin' in this bar since they opened up this mornin'
And it's almost time to close tonight
I guess it's about time to go find me a gutter tuck myself in tonight
Where does a man go when he's already on the bottom
It's really not much choise he's got
Either picks hisself up and tries again or just lays back down to rot
No life starts out to be like mine pain is never planned
And yet here I sit with nothing in the world but these confessions of a broken man
I'm just askin' you to listen not to understand these confessions of a broken manI was born in Saginaw Michigan I grew up in a house on Saginaw bay
My dad was a poor hard working Saginaw fisherman
Too many times he came home with too little pay
I loved a girl in Saginaw Michigan the daughter of a wealthy wealthy man
But he called me that son of a Saginaw fisherman
And said I wasn't good enough for his daughter's hand
That's why I went up to Alaska searchin' around for gold
Like a crazy fool I was diggin' in the frozen ground so cold
But with each new day I pray I'd strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw Michigan
I wrote my love in Saginaw Michigan I said honey I'm comin' home please wait for me
And you can tell your dad I'm coming back a richer man
I've hit the biggest strike in Klondike history
So her dad met me in Saginaw Michigan
He gave me a great big party and we served champagne
Then he said son now you're a wise young ambitious man
Now won't you sell your father-in-law your Klondike claim
So now he's up there in Alaska diggin' in the cold cold ground
Why the greedy fool is lookin' for the gold I never found
It serves him right and no one here is a missin' him
Least of all the newly weds of Saginaw Michigan
Least of all us newly weds of Saginaw Michigan (Saginaw Michigan)He's the King of kings
I stood upon a lonely mountain side
When suddenly a vision came to me
I saw Golgota's Hill where Jesus died
To give men hope for immortality
I thought do we appreciate for call
The cruel suffering crucification brings
Kneel down and pray before your chance is lost
For He is the King of kings
I stood beside a river deep and wide
And watched its waters flow out to the sea
And I thought why do we let our selfish pride
Fill our lives with shame and miseryWell once I met a pretty little girl and she was fair to see
I fell in love with a pretty little girl she fell in love with me
I kissed her on her dimpled chin while stars in heaven did play
But along come a howl in that old north wind and carried her away
North wind north wind bring my baby back again
North wind where did she go nobody but you will ever know
It seems I hear her calling me and when I answer back
I find it's just that old north wind a whistlin' round my shack
Each night before I go to sleep down on my knees I pray
That the old north wind come a howlin' by and carry me away
North wind north wind...I was a rover, on land and on sea
Til a good woman's love made a new man of me
Life had no meaning, it was so incomplete
Til a good woman's love put me back on my feet
Still a-roamin' I go home in the evening
And she's waiting there
And I know that no matter what happens
She'll always care
And when night falls and the moon shines above
I'm a man with a dream and a good woman's loveWhat are you waiting for / if not for me
What are you waiting for / it must be me
To take you over my knee
And spank you mercilessly
I can do that / oh you'll see
And everyday will be like free
And sleep / adventure you will see
And I'll have and you'll have me
On a bench / with your twisted fingers in me
In the rain / with my sundress torn off of me
Sliding down grassy slopes / where we can be aloneI'm a going down down down to the river
And there ain't nobody gonna have to hold my hand
I'm a going down down down to the river
Gonna bury my troubles in the river bottom sand
You said goodbye to me this morning and slowly walked out of my life
I don't know how I'll live without you I only know I've gotta try
I'm a going down down down to the river
And there ain't nobody gonna have to hold my hand
I'm a going down down down to the river
Gonna bury my troubles in the river bottom sand
The telephone has started ringing friends call to see if it is true
I don't know words to say it's over I only know that I love youHow I love that old melody they are playing,
I've heard it in so many different songs.
It's made stars of country music singers,
And the tune just keeps playing on.
Oh, I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes,
Seems to me its been around since time began,
It was there with our solders during war time,
And right today we still hear it now and then.
Roy Acuff was a young country singer
Who's record were just starting to be heard
That old tune took him right up to stardom
on the wings of the great speckled bird.
Hank Thomson is a country music legend
He sang western swing and songs of grief and strife
That same tune gave Hank the break he needed
On a record called the wild side of life.
A young girl made the world stop and listen
Kitty Wells was that young singers name
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels
That melody ran clear as country rain.
Those note must have came straight out of heaven
In so many different songs they were the same
I know someday they'll be etched in gold forever
And placed in the country music hall of fame
And placed in the country music
Hall of fame....I work down at the Pizza Pit
And I drive and old Hyundai
I still live with my mom and dad
I'm 5'3 and overweight
I'm a sci-fi fanatic
Mild asthmatic
Never been to 2nd base
But there's a whole another me
That you need to see
Go check out Myspace
'Cause online I'm down in Hollywood
I'm 6'5 and I look damn good
I drive a Maserati
I'm a black belt in Karate
And I love a good glass of wine
It turns girls on that I'm mysterious
I tell 'em I don't want nothing serious
'Cause even on a slow day I can have a three way
Chat with two women at one time
I'm so much cooler online
So much cooler online
I get home, I kiss my mom
And she fixes me a snack
I head down to my basement bedroom
And fire up my Mac
In real life, the only time I've
Ever even been to L.A.
Was when I got the chance with the marching band
To play tuba in the Rose Parade
Online I live in Malibu
I posed for Calvin Kline, I've been in GQ
I'm single and I'm rich
And I got a set of six pack abs that'll blow your mind
It turns girls on that I'm mysterious
I tell 'em I don't want nothing serious
'Cause even on a slow day I can have a three way
Chat with two women at one time
I'm so much cooler online
Yeah I'm cooler online
When you got my kinda stacks, it's hard to get a date
Let alone a real girlfriend
But I grow another foot
And I lose a bunch of weight every time I log in
Online I'm out in Hollywood
I'm 6'5 and I look damn good
Even on a slow day, I can have a three way
Chat with two women at one time
I'm so much cooler online
Yeah I'm cooler online
I'm so much cooler online
Yeah I'm cooler online
Hey, I'm cooler online
(Yeah he's cooler online)
I'm so much cooler online
I'm so much cooler online
(Yeah he's cooler, yeah)
Oh yeah(Instumental)
This piece was written by seeing the journey
of the wise men. The opening note on the piano
is the Star of Bethlehem. The shimmering is our
trip down from the Star to the sands that are lit
by the midnight sky. The first melody of music
is the first camel as it slowly passes by. When
the melody begins to harmonize with itself, we
see the secong camel pass. The third and final
camel begins the majority of the piece. In the
faces of the wise men we see weariness driven
by faith. The gifts they are bearing are ones of
request and honor. The music slows to reveal,
over the last hill of sand, the little town of
Bethlehem , the end of their journey and the
beginning of hope.CHORUS:
Shine your light against the dark
Stand upright and make your mark
Do your best wherever you may be
And shine your light for me
-------
Long ago when I was just
A boy of tender years
My father told me life's a road
Paved with joy and tears
And as you travel you must choose
Between what's right and wrong
Remember sin is giving in
For Heaven's sake be strong
-------
REPEAT CHORUS:
-------
As I grew beyond my teens
The world began to press
My father's words began to fade
Lost to selfishness
And after years of walking down
The wrong side of the track
One night I cried and deep inside
My father's words came back
-------
REPEAT CHORUS:
-------
My father said that kindness is
The light of God in man
So I was told to shine like gold
On everyone I can
I changed my ways and did my best
To right the wrong I'd done
I settled down and in a year
God blessed us with a son
Now he's barely nine years old
A learner on life's way
He wonders why a day goes by
He doesn't hear me say
-------
REPEAT CHORUS:
---------
Do your best wherever you may be
And shine your light
Shine your light
Do your best wherever you may be
And shine your light for meMirror, Mirror, on my wall,
Tell me, who is the loneliest fool of all
No, wait a minute, I believe I see
The answer staring back at me
Spent most of the morning laying in bed
Lunch was a black coffee
And three cigarettes
They say it will kill me,
But I've got a hunch
That this broken heart's
Gonna beat 'em to the punch
Mirror, Mirror, on my wall,
Tell me, who is the loneliest fool of all
No, wait a minute, I believe I see
The answer staring back at me
Yes, I'm the one who swore she would stay
Right up to the moment
The you-Haul drove away
She didn't leave a table;
She didn't leave a chair
But she knew what she was doing
When she left you hanging there
Mirror, Mirror, on my wall,
Tell me, who is the loneliest fool of all
No, wait a minute, I believe I see
The answer staring back at me
No, wait a minute, I believe I see
The answer staring back at meFolds and folds of hurling whirling words come spilling out yer hole
Don't intellectualize yer eloquent vomit when you rise
Now peter had Paul don't have it I have it have it said I
In this rolling glowing growing stolen place that don't belong to me
It ain't funny you say okay I had it up to here with you
This giddy little lifetime yer time my time don't agree with you
Some temper axes in the fire some sharpen knives upon a stone
Some chop up veggies in the hobart some use the bloody robo coupPlease, please have pity on me
Oh can't you see that I'm in misery
Please, please I'm begging like a fool
Whoa is me look who's blue
There ain't no girl that's ever gonna tie me down
I'm going out each night to paint the town
Well I was doing fine till I met you
Whoa is me look who's blue
Please, please have pity on me
Oh can't you see that I'm in misery
Please, please I'm begging like a fool
Whoa is me look who's blue
Please, please have pity on me
Oh can't you see that I'm in misery
Please, please I'm begging like a foolHave you heard the news? It's raining on the moon
The man in the TV said, "It's raining on the moon"
Even the scientists can't believe it's true
They're showing diagrams and little moon cartoons
Where we are is everything we know
All we've got is the love that we show
It was a man who knew that none of this was true
He swore by God above, the end was coming soon
Now there's a rocket bus, leaves every afternoon
And funny little cars racin' on the dunes
Where we are is everything we know
All we've got is the love that we show
Everyone aboard, it's raining on the moon
(What would you stay here for? It's raining on the moon)
Everyone aboard, it's raining on the moon
(No worries anymore, it's raining on the moon)
Everyone aboard, it's raining on the moon
(What would you stay here for? It's raining on the moon)
Everyone aboard, it's raining on the moon
(No worries anymore, it's raining on the moon)
Everyone aboard, it's raining on the moon
(What would you stay here for? It's raining on the moon)
Everyone aboard, it's raining on the moon
(No worries anymore, it's raining on the moon)When the road is rocky and heavy is your load
When the sky is cloudy and the sunshine's gone
When your life is troubled and nothing's going right
Bring it to Jesus he'll show you the light
Well bring it to Jesus and he'll show you the way
Bring it to Jesus and he'll brighten your day
When your life is troubled and you can't sleep at night
Bring it to Jesus and he'll show you the light
[ steel - piano ]
Well Jesus is the Saviour the light of the world
The only way to heaven so we read in his word
Tell him all your troubles and let him make 'em right
Bring it to Jesus and he'll show you the light
Well bring it to Jesus...(Though I'm only second best you're still first with me)
I tried to make you love me I've done everything I could
I thought if I tried long enough maybe someday that you would
But there was someone else before me and it's her you're lovin' still
And I know no matter what I'd do I'm only second best
Only second best that's all I will ever be
Even though I'm second best you're still first with me
And I'll be loving you when they fall my hand I guess
I love you even though I know I'm only second best
I know you've tried to love me and I'd hope you would in time
I know that when you're holding me it's her that's on your mind
Now I know you can't get over her but I love you nonless
But it makes no difference what I'd do I'm only second best
Only second best...
I love you even though I know I'm only second bestAll the sailors with their seasick mamas
Hear the sirens on the shore
They're singin' songs for pimps with tailors
Who charge ten dollars at the door
And you can really learn a lot that way
It will change you in the middle of the day
Though your confidence may be shattered
It doesn't matter
And all the great explorers
Are now in granite laid
Under white sheets for the great unveiling
At the big parade
And you can really learn a lot that way
It will change you in the middle of the day
Though your confidence, it may be shattered
It doesn't matter
And all the bush league batters
Are left to die on the diamond
And in the stands the home crowd scatters
For the turnstiles
For the turnstiles
For the turnstiles
For the turnstilesHeaven knows where I'd be now,
If you had not found me.
On that road that takes a man,
To places he's not meant to be.
I wasn't ready for the touch,
That turned my life around.
Now I'm helpless in your hands,
It's love that ties me down.
Angel of no mercy,
Girl, you take my breath away.
And it feels so good, it hurts me,
To think that you might fly away.
Can't you see that I've surrendered,
You stole this old heart blind.
You're an angel of no mercy,
But I don't mind.
Ain't it strange how love can take,
A heart that's hard as steel,
Hold it tightly in the fire,
And teach that cold heart how to feel.
Touch me now, I'm still not sure,
You're truly flesh and bone.
Heaven knows, you can't be from,
This world that I live on.
Angel of no mercy,
Girl, you take my breath away.
And it feels so good, it hurts me,
To think that you might fly away.
Can't you see that I've surrendered,
You stole this old heart blind.
You're an angel of no mercy,
But I don't mind.
Can't you see that I've surrendered,
You stole this old heart blind.
You're an angel of no mercy,
But I don't mind.You've been acting funny lately,
What's up with you
You clam up or you just talk crazy,
Flippin' mood to mood
If you think that I don't care,
you're missing something
If you think there's nothing there,
you're wrong.
[Chorus]
It's all in your mind,
Psyching you out,
feeding you lines
Your heart must be blind
If you can't see the light in my eyes
You can't look inside me,
but if you could you'd find
it's all in your mind
There's nothing wrong
with second guessing,
or being sensitive
I love you,
I'm confessing
if I forget to mention it
If you think that's how it is
that my hearts not here with you
And I've nothing more to give,
well I do
[Chorus]
It's all in your mind,
Psyching you out,
feeding you lines
Your heart must be blind
If you can't see the light in my eyes
You can't look inside me,
but if you could you'd find
it's all in your mind
Imagination, is taking you there.
[Chorus]
It's all in your mind,
Psyching you out,
feeding you lines
Your heart must be blind
If you can't see the light in my eyes
You can't look inside me,
but if you could you'd find
it's all in your mindI know they all know that I love her they don't say a word I can tell
The people who live here on Main Street know and respect me too well
Each morning she brings me my coffee thank you good looking I'd say
Everyone knows I'm in love with the waitress at Main Street Cafe
I watch as she walks by my table I'm longing to hold her so tight
I know once again I will meet her when she gets through working tonight
Someday when my ship comes to anchor I'll come and I'll take her away
My schemes and my dreams are including the waitress at Main Street Cafe
I know that some stranger would wonder why we steal a quick little kiss
I eat and I drink all my orange juice yet I never leave her a tip
She says she will take off that apron when we can afford it some day
Yes the girl that I married is working she's the waitress at Main Street CafeIf I could be the reason your hair's a mess,
The bass drum beatin' way down deep in your chest,
If I could be the voice on your radio,
Then I could be your long ride home.
If mine could be the name that changes yours,
The wine in your glass,
The swing on your porch,
The dollar in your pocket, and the peaceful in your sleep,
Then I'd be what you mean to me.
Standing here,
Watching you,
Turning every head in this crowded room,
The lights down low,
Dancin slow,
Oh, if falling's how you feel,
And perfect is what you see,
Then I'd be what you mean to me.
Oh yeah
If I could be the fire in your firefly,
The cool in the rain,
The spark in your eye,
The answer to your prayer,
And the faith that sets you free,
Then I'd be what you mean to me.
Standing here,
Watching you,
Turning every head in this crowded room,
The lights down low,
Dancin slow,
Oh, if falling's how you feel,
And perfect is what you see,
Then I'd be what you mean to me,
What you mean to me
And oh, all of this talkin' makes you laugh,
But I've gotta let you know just how I feel
Eel eel while I'm standing here,
Watching you,
Turning every head in this crowded room,
And the lights down low,
Dancin slow,
Oh, if falling's how you feel,
And perfect is what you see,
Then I'd be what you mean to me.
Yeah falling's how you feel,
And perfect's what you see,
Then I'd be what you mean to me.
Be what you mean to me.
Oh, be what you mean, what you mean, what you mean,
What you mean to me,
HmmO little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight
For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth
Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus
Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Look down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
Asleep on the hay
O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord EmmanuelThat's a death defying walk she's got
Dancing to the parking lot, oh eighteen
What she does to T-shirts
So good make my eyes hurt, oh eighteen
Somebody ought to write a song about it, so I did
It makes me wish I was a kid again, eighteen
We were made out of asbestos
Dairy Queen for breakfast at eighteen, eighteen
Rock and roll was king
And cars were everything at eighteen, eighteen
Nobody could have told us anything and if they tried
It gave us something to fight about, eighteen
Blue jeans, young hearts knockin' out
Big dreams, you and me work
We're burning like gasoline
It's amazing that we ever lived past, eighteen
Shooting city limit signs
Chasing girls and wasting time, oh eighteen
Pretending we were tough
Telling stories we made up, oh eighteen
Dressing like the pictures
Hanging in our bedroom
We tore out of a magazine, eighteen
Blue jeans, young hearts knockin' out
Big dreams, you and me work
We're burning like gasoline
It's amazing that we ever lived past, eighteen, eighteen, eighteen
Cruisin' in convertibles
Completely indestructible
We were hookin' up and hangin' out
Believing what we sang about, eighteen
Kroeger on a Friday night
Making circles out of headlights
Yeah, it felt so good being alive, eighteenSummer Country Skies
Charlie Landsborough
Songs From The Heart
You find romance in the grace
of this dirty one eyed town
Me I've got to get away
what gets you high just gets me down
And the difference in our dreams
I can briefly summarize
You are winter city streets
I am summer coun--try skies
Every day my heart cries
for the blue summer country skies
You can keep your kitchen sink
I can see a mountain stream
You escape inside a drink
I prefer to dream
There's a hunger in my heart
nothing ever satisfies
In these winter city streets
give me summer country skies
Unlike you my heart dies
neath the blue summer country skies
By your fascination grows
with the pleasures of the night
My imagination goes
on a multi colored flight
To a land that wears a smile
and where beauty filled my eyes
Parked on winter city streets
neath tha summer country skiesLove's Gonna Live Here Again
Oh, the sun's gonna shine in my life once more
Love's gonna live here again
Things are gonna be the way they were before
Love's gonna live here again
Love's gonna live here
Love's gonna live here,
Love's gonna live here again
No more loneliness,
Only happiness
Love's gonna live here again
[Instrumental]
I hear bells a'ringin',
I hear birds a'singin'
Love's gonna live here again.
I hear bees a'hummin',
And I know the day's a'comin'
Love's gonna live here again
Love's gonna live here
Love's gonna live here,
Love's gonna live here again
No more loneliness,
Only happiness
Love's gonna live here again
Love's gonna live here againA mother sings as she rocks her babies
Children sing the noted nursery rhymes
The old church bell is ringing for the Sunday morning singing
Music is as old as the time
As the farmer works the fields he sings a song
The songbirds in the trees sing along
And the wind makes melodies as it whistles through the trees
Man's burdens are made lighter with a song
There'll always be music as long as there's a story to be told
There'll always be music cause music is the voice of the soul
There'll always be music
Rain makes rhytmic sounds when it's falling
There's music in a new born baby's cry
There's music all around and there is no sweeter sound
For that's the way a man expresses life
In heaven there's a choir of angels singing
We often heard about God's angel band
Music will live on when men on earth are gone
There'll still be music in that promised land
There'll always be music...The red headed stranger from Blue Rock Montana
Rode into town one day
And under his knees was a raging black stallion
And lopin' behind was a bay
The red headed stranger had eyes like the thunder
His lips that were sad and tight
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
His heart was heavy as night
Don't cross him, don't boss him, he's wild in his sorrow
He's ridin' and hidin' his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him, just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again
A yellow haired woman leaned out of her window
Watched as he passed her way
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion
But cast greedy eyes on the bay
But how could she know that this dancing bay pony
Meant more to him than life
For this was the horse his little lost darlin' was ridden
When she was his wife
The yellow haired lady came down to the tavern
Looked up the stranger there
He bought her a drink and he gave her some money
He just didn't seem to care
She followed him out as he saddled his stallion
And laughed as she grabbed at the bay
But he shot her so quick they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say
Don't cross him, don't boss him
They buried the yellow haired woman at sunset
The stranger went free of course
Cause you can't hang a man for shootin' a woman
Who's a tryin' to steal your horse
Don't cross him, don't boss himAin't we all the stars
Ain't we all the stars
Playing the leading part
In our own soap opera?
Sherry shampooed 'til she got her own chair
Now she's playing shrink to every head of hair
A mani or a pedi or color or a cut
Eight hours a day, it's the same old stuff
They got trouble with their ex and his next wife
Sands through the hourglass, days of our lives
Ain't we all the stars
Ain't we all the stars
Playing the leading part
In a daytime drama?
Young and restless hearts
Duckin' and throwing darts
Yeah, we're all big stars
In our own soap opera
Jimmy wipes down the bar, makes a mean martini
They tip it on back and give him the skinny
Shaken or stirred or a bottle or a draft
They're baring their souls to the bottom of the glass
They got trouble with their girl and their girlfriend's mama
This one life to live got a whole lotta drama
Ain't we all the stars
Ain't we all the stars
Playing the leading part
In a daytime drama?
Young and restless hearts
Duckin' and throwing darts
Yeah, we're all big stars
In our own soap opera
Yeah, yeah
This town might be little bitty
But just ask Sherry or Jimmy
If Hollywood was handing out Emmys
We'd all be saying gimme, gimme, gimmeWell that's how it is when it's over and done
All bets are off and we both go runnin' for cover
Blamin' eachother
Yeah the grapevine will hum with the fiction or fact
Gets kinda messy in the aftermath of a meltdown
It's always a small, small town
Chorus:
You can doctor the spin when you tell all your friends
But you can't say that I didn't love you
Does it make me a jerk 'cause it just didn't work
When you can't say that I didn't love you
There were some things we could not overcome
But love or the lack of it never was one
You can put a new face on that old twist of fate
But deep down inside you can't say that I didn't love you
Now It's only normal to criticize
How it all went down 'cause the tension's running high
And we say things, that we don't mean
But that doesn't change last summer and fall
If that wasn't love then what do you call, September
Do you remember?
Chorus:2
You can doctor the spin when you tell all your friends
But you can't say that I didn't love you
You can vilify me to a certain degree
But you can't say that I didn't love you
There were some things we could not overcome
But love or the lack of it never was one
You can tailor the truth till it fits like a suit
But deep down inside you can't say that I didn't love you
There were some things we could not overcome
But love or the lack of it never was one
Chorus:3
You can doctor the spin when you tell all your friends
But you can't say that I didn't love you
Does it make me a jerk cause it just didn't work
When you can't say that I didn't love you
You can vilify me to a certain degree
But you can't say that I didn't love you
There were some things we could not overcome
But love or the lack of it never was one
You can put a new face on that old twist of fate
But deep down inside you can't say that I didn't love youSo your conscience finally hit you
And you're feeling guilty
And you're wishing I was there
So you wanna say you're sorry
Well, please forgive me if I'm too gone to care
You can take back your goodbyes
Wipe off those sad eyes
?Cause I've got some tears of my own
Weather man says it?s gonna rain tonight
The kind of storm where the basement floods
And you lose the lights, should have thought of that before
?Cause I'm not your blue sky anymore
So you heard the pitter-patter of a lost heart beating
And learned what it was for
So you made a list of shoulders
That you'd be needing
Well mine aren't yours anymore
Come on, show me your temper
Be the man I remember
So I won't forget what you've done
Weather man says it?s gonna rain tonight
The kind of storm where the basement floods
And you lose the lights, should have thought of that before
?Cause I'm not your blue sky anymore
don't wanna be that blue sky
I'm not your blue sky anymoreWell, I had the blues
But now theyre gone
Im on a big black freight train
And were movin' on
Im on a big black train and Im movin' on
Im on a big black train and Ill soon be gone
Well, this big black train, it keeps movin' on
Well, if you want me, baby, better get on the track
Got a one-way ticket and I wont be back
Well, this big black freight train
Its movin' down the railroad track
Well, you cheated on me, baby, and you told me lies
You said that you was gonna laugh every time I cried
Well, this big black train
Were tellin' you good byeShe's pony-tailed, and she's halter-topped
Her bumber sticker says "I hate hip-hop"
With a southern drawl, she says howdy y'all
And her hands ain't afraid of dirt
He's proud of his old truck
He spray painted over dnets and rust
The moto smokes, it's got four bald tires, but the radio works
Raised ont he good book, and out country songs
Ride down back roads singing along
[Chorus:]So blame me for the way the are
Their love of the fiddle and the steel guitar
Blame me for their cowboy hats
Roper boots, wrangler jeans, and rifle racks
If you wanna point a finger at somebody for they way they believe
Blame me
They were kids when Hag and me came to town
All eyes and ears, look at 'em now
Cneter stage on the Grand Ole Opry on a Saturday night
Sing about fishin' and the Lord above
Fallin' in and out of love
From Aunt Bea to Uncle Sam and the American pie
From big cities to little towns
We're hard core country inside and outInvisible tears in my eyes incredible pain in my heart
Indestructible memories are passing in review
Impossible though things may get improbable I will forget
Indelible memories of sweet lovable you
You're back again so I'll let you in
Although I'm only stealing pictures from the past
Those arms are not real but somehow I feel
If I'd just close my eyes then maybe it will last
Invisible tears in my eyes...
Invisible tears in my eyes...I'm alone in a house made of sorrow and each room is haunted with you
Should the end of the world come tomorrow I'll be waiting on Heartbreak Avenue
I scatter all our promises behind me there's no use to hope that they'll come true
But if you change your mind you can find me I'll be waiting on Heartbreak Avenue
I was warned that some day you'd desert me
And I'd wake up and find that we were through
They all told me that you'd only hurt me and I'd end up on Heartbreak Avenue
Someday you may understand this yearning when somebody does the same to you
Then when deep in your heart there's a burning
We'll be neighbors on Heartbreak Avenue we'll be neighbors on Heartbreak AvenueI've got something to say
But it's all vanity, it's all vanity
I found a tune I could play
But it's all vanity, it's all vanity
Call off the guard, call of the search
Their heads are chopped off
They're running in circles, they're running in circles
I have a plan for the day
But it's all vanity, it's all vanity
I've got love pouring out of my veins
But it's all vanity, it's all vanity
Call of the guards, call off the search
Their heads are chopped off
They're running in circles, they're running in circles
Running in circles, They're running in circlesIf every you're alone
And life becomes
A stone around your neck
And hard times beckon you
In your heart
Always carry a dream or two
Don't let the shadows creep
Into the hope that keeps
All fears at bay
And luck will favor you
In your heart
Always carry a dream or two
A dream is a magic post
That keeps your soul a float
A dreams of prayer the angels wrote
And only those with loving hearts can see
So open up your heart and dream with me
I'd gladly throw away
The gift that yesterday has given me
If only I could be with you
In my heart
I still carry a dream or two
A dream is a magic post
That keeps your soul a float
A dreams of prayer the angels wrote
And only those with loving hearts can see
So open up your heart and dream with me
I'd gladly throw away
The gift that yesterday has given me
If only I could be with you
In my heart
I still carry a dream or two
In my heart I still carry a dream of youI plowed the fields and I planted the seed I worked my hands to the bone
But the ground laid barren till He sent the sunshine for I can do nothing alone
I raised the corn and I rode to the mill with the best crop I ever had grown
But the wheel wouldn't grind till He stirred the waters for I can do nothing alone
I can do nothing alone I'm weak and my Master is strong
I held the pencil but He wrote this song for I can do nothing alone
And now as my years lead me into the valley I've asked Him to please come home
For I walk in search of the good life hereafter and I can do nothing alone
I can do nothing alone...I was breathein' but lord I was barely alive
Findin' reasons for losin the will to survive
I pushed the heart far beyond what it could take
Sometimes somethin's gotta break
[Chorus]
Now it's alright, I think I see a light there up ahead
Yeah it's alright, I think I've finally risen' from the dead
The fire inside of me was gone like the wind
Now it's stirrin' within
It's coming back again
Down in the askes of a light that I let bury me
One hand pullin' me under, and another tryin' to set me free
In the struggle, I know I lost my way
Somehow I never lost my faith
[Chorus]
Sometimes you stumble over steps you never take
Sometimes you learn from your mistakes
[Chorus]
It's comin' back againI never dreamed her footsteps could ever sound so lonely
As they did as she left today
I raised my hand and brushed your tear as I helplessly stood there
Watching my world walk away
I'm leaving forever she said with her eyes but her soft lips had nothing to say
I never thought I'd live to see the day I'd be standin' in this doorway
Watching my world walk away
I'm leaving forever
I never thought I'd live to see
Watching my world walk awayShe's the closest thing to happiness I found since losing you
My chance to live and love again just someone that I turn to
No I can't love her completely she knows what I'm going through
Cause she loves me the way that I love you
She's all the strenght I'll ever need to get me over you
She'll help me make you someone in the past that I once knew
She's beside me when I need her and these arms she'll never use
Cause she loves me the way that I love you
She wants me to want her the way that I want you
But now she's just someone to help me ease the hurt you put me through
No she won't erase your footprints but in time she'll fill your shoes
Cause she loves me the way that I love you
No she won't erase your footprints...Girl I caught you in your little white lie
Red handed, red handed
You said you had to work tonight
But here you are dancing
Slow dancing
In this honky talk with someone else
And all you got to say for yourself
Is "So?"
So?
Sorry, so?
[Chorus]
So so long, bye bye baby
I'll catch you on the flip side maybe
Don't you slip slide on a tear when you find me gone
Go go on cry cry baby
Those tears are gonna drip drop maybe
But you're gonna miss my good love baby
For so so long
so so long
Let me buy you a goodbye drink
Make it a double
A double
Cause I've seen everything I need to see
You're nothing but trouble
Big trouble
And one other thing before I go
I want to tell you that I think you're so
So, so
Oh I ain't gonna sink that low
[Chorus]
I bet you think I'm gonna let it slide
The way you're flashing me those puppy dog eyes
Right? yeah right.. Right?
Wrong!
[Chorus]
See yaIn the southern part of Texas, east and west of El Paso
Where the mighty Franklin Mountains guard the trail to Mexico
There's a new made widow crying and a hearse a-rolling slow
And I guess that Devil's passed this way again
There's a lathered Sorrel Stallion running through the Joshua Trees
A young man in the saddle with his coat tails in the breeze
Got a six gun on his right hip and a rifle at his knee
And he's dealing in a game that he can't win
Poor Billy Bonney, you're only twenty one
Pat Garrett's got your name on every bullet in his gun
Each notch you carved on your six guns, got a bloody tale to tell
Well, you're a mile ahead of Garrett and a step outside of Hell
Them fancy clothes you're wearing and the women in your bed
Can't take away the faces of the men that you left dead
As you ride across the badlands with a price upon your head
Now that wheel or fortune starts to turn
Your reputation's grown 'til it's the biggest in the land
And there ain't a lot of people left who wanna call your hand
And I guess you go down shooting, just like all branded men
And when you shake hands with the Devil, you get burned
Poor Billy Bonney, you're only twenty one
Pat Garrett's got your name on every bullet in his gun
Each notch you carved on your six guns, got a bloody tale to tell
You're a mile ahead of Garrett and a step outside of Hell
Poor Billy Bonney, you're only twenty one
Pat Garrett's got your name on every bullet in his gun
Each notch you carved on your six guns, got a bloody tale to tell
You're a mile ahead of Garrett and a step outside of HellShe was found beneath the gate,
Forsaken at the gate.
Who would have thought that so much love
Could be so carelessly misplaced.
Found. Beneath the gate.
We gazed upon the moon,
A honed and whetted moon.
Wondered if you saw the same
An hour from your mothers womb.
Gazing at the moon.
We stood beneath the gate.
Three beneath the gate.
The rare good will of the random world,
Smiling like a sickle moon.
She was found beneath the gate.
Forsaken at the gate.
Found beneath the gate.(Dolly Parton)
If I should stay
Well, I would only be in your way
And so I'll go, and yet I know
That I'll think of you each step of my way
And I will always love you
I will always love you
Bitter-sweet memories
That's all I have, and all I'm taking with me
Good-bye, oh, please don't cry
'Cause we both know that I'm not
What you need
But I will always love you
I will always love you
And I hope life, will treat you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
Oh, I do wish you joy
And I wish you happiness
But above all this
I wish you love
I love you, I will always love
I will always, always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you( Drag City Supersession album )
There is no comfort so
Familiar as the silence
Inasmuch as we touch
We understand each other
As for us we've become
Surrounded by the silence
Refugees from our dreams
We didn't dare surrender
I would not love for naught
He never seemed to feel it
Sometimes i wish that i
Could be content without countingLonely sound of distant thunder stirs my restless sleep
And the dream that I was lost in slips away
Of a young son and his mama so innocent back then
Would she even recognize her boy today
'Cause I have fought into the darkness
And I've spilled blood, with these two hands
And in my heart I wish I could believe
That who I was, is who I am
I've crossed mountains, hills, and valleys
From sea to shining sea, barren sands to blinding snow
I held my brother as he laid dying
Beside me in some field, said a prayer, and let him go
And I have fought into the darkness
And I've spilled blood, with these two hands
And in my heart I wish I could believe
That who I was, is who I am
I'm letting go
(I'm letting go)
Letting go
(I'm letting go)
Well, I'm letting go
(I'm letting go)
Letting go
(I'm letting go)
Now with all my trials behind me I'm so blessed to cast my eyes
On my family and my home
And with faith I faced my demons when God was on our side
All that's left, is letting go
I'm letting go
(I'm letting go)
Letting go
(I'm letting, letting go)
Well, I'm letting go
(I'm letting go)
Letting go
(I'm letting, letting go)Oh once my heart was light and gay and didn't realize
Until you vanished from my side and opened up my eyes
I balanced up the books on you the answer's very clear
The final total comes into exactly nothin' dear
I'm fillin' up a washing tub of tears I shed for you
And dumpin' in my oldest dreams I've got a job to do
I'm washing all my dreams in tears to rid my misery
And hangin' out on the line that you handed me
[ guitar ]
At night when I lie down to rest instead of coutin' sheep
I count the many lies you told to put myself to sleep
I count the times you cheated to and knowing how you are
I'd like to count them everyone but I can't count that far
I'm fillin' up a washing tub...
[ steel ]
I'll take the brush you used and given me to brush all fear
And brush away my thoughts of you that linger round so near
Put on my walking shoes I got when you gave me the air
Go out and found somebody new someone who really care
I'm fillin' up a washing tub...Have you ever had one of those days
When you really need a friend
The day drags on and on
And you think there's no end
Then you know how I feel
Have you ever had one of those nights
When you just lie awake
Starin' at the ceiling
Untile the dawn breaks
Then you know how I feel
If you've heard goodbye
And something inside just won't heal
If a memory won't set you free
And you know that it never will
Then you know how I feel
If you've heard goodbye
And something inside just won't heal
If a memory won't set you free
And you know that it never will
Then you know how I feel
Then you know how I feelIt's hard to hide a lingering disappointment
But most of the time I wear it well
But there are times when I just can't help remembering
The night you left, that rainy night when my whole future fell
Rainy nights and memories go together
And with every drop of rain I feel the pain
I can almost hear my pleading, on the night you were leaving
But I might have well have tried to stop the rain
The blowing wind that moans outside my window
Seems to echo the closing of a door
For it was then I first realized, I had heard your last goodbye
And my whole world went crumbling to the floor
Rainy nights and memories go together
And with every drop of rain I feel the pain
I can almost hear my pleading, on the night you were leaving
But I might have well have tried to stop the rainShe was workin' a summer job
Sellin' t-shirts towels and sunblock
A Midwest girl who couldn't live without the beach
I was a local boy who worked next door
Never seen a smile like hers before
She put her feet up on the dash of my old Jeep
It was henna tattoos tank tops and ray bans
And hearts drawn in the sand
Cause summer flings ain't meant to last
They always burn too hot too fast
Ya don't talk about it cause you both understand
Ya get drunk on those boardwalk days
That pretty buzzed look on her face
And it fades away just like a seaside tan
And hearts drawn in the sand
Sit out on the St. Johns pier
She drank wine and I drank beer
And when we saw a boat light blink we'd make a wish
Then we'd take a walk where the waves hit your feet
She'd lean right in close to me
And I could taste the sun and salt on her lips
And that day would wash away when the tide came in
Like hearts drawn in the sand
Oh summer flings ain't meant to last
They always burn too hot too fast
You don't talk about it cause you both understand
You get drunk on those boardwalk days
And that pretty buzzed look on her face
And it fades away just like a seaside tan
And hearts drawn in the sandThere's a lot of strange men in cell Block 10 but the strangest of them all
Was a friend of mine who just spent his time staring at the wall
(Staring at the wall)
In his hand was a note that his gal had wrote and it proved that crime don't pay
Twas the very same gal he robbed and stole for name in her weddin' day
(Name in her weddin' day)
As he looked at the wall so strong and tall I could hear him softly curse
Nobody a tall ever climbed that wall but I'm gonna be the first
(I'm gonna be the first)
The warden walked by and said son don't try I would hate to see you fall
There is no doubt they would carry you out if you ever touch that wall
(Ever touch that wall )
A year's gone by since he made his try but I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died but he never made that wall
(Never made that wall)
There's never been a man ever shook this can but I know a man who tried
The newspapers called it a jailbreak plan but I know it was suicide
Know it was suicideI found a flower in a field
A field of cars and people, Rows of concrete, paint, and steel
Manhattan is where it grew
And I thought, to cut it from its stem
And take it from the cracks
Between bricks that it lay in
And save it from city strife
Away from the city life
Then someone, they whispered in my ear
A county girl can't be made out of anybody here
Don't touch it, it loves you not
Don't touch it, it loves you not
Cause blue birds, Don't fly without their wings
And when we put them in a cage
The world can't hear them sing
So selfish when greed sets in
Possession, the king of sin
And people don't ever let you down
Forever find a way to kill whatever love they've found
A heart beat and I want it too
Manhattan is where she grew
So I left and I let the flower be
And yesterday saw the flower on cable TV
Much prettier than here with me
For all of the world to see
Much prettier than here with meThe bluest skies you've ever seen in Seattle
And the hills the greenest green in Seattle
Like a beautiful child growing up free and wild
Full of hopes and full of fears
Full of laughter full of tears
Full of dreams to last the years in Seattle
In Seattle
When it's time to leave your home and your loved ones
It's the hardest thing a boy can ever do
And you pray that you will find
Someone warm and sweet and kind
But you're not sure what's waiting there for you
The bluest skies you've ever seen in Seattle
And the hills the greenest green in Seattle
Like a beautiful child growing up free and wild
Full of hopes and full of fears
Full of laughter full of tears
Full of dreams to last the years in Seattle
In Seattle
When you find your own true love
You will know it
By her smile, by the look in her eye
Scent of pine trees in the air
Never knew a day so fair
It makes you feel so good
That you could cryMonday's promise is Tuesday's lie
Saturday's party is Sunday's fight
Somethin's wrong with you and I
Love's gone wrong that used to be right
And I can feel it slippin' away
Slowly, slowly slippin' away
It'll be gone in a few more days
If we don't stop this love of ours
From slippin' away
Wednesday's kisses are Thursday's frowns
We can't live two days in a row
When our world's not upside down
Here we stand watchin' it go
And I can feel it slippin' away
Slowly, slowly slippin' away
It'll be gone in a few more days
If we don't stop this love of ours
From slippin' away
Roses are red, violets are blue
Sugar is sweet some of the time
This puzzle's missin' a piece or two
We've got the grapes but never the wine
And I can feel it slippin' away
Slowly, slowly slippin' away
It'll be gone in a few more days
If we don't stop this love of ours
From slippin' away
And I can feel it slippin' away
Slowly, slowly slippin' away
It'll be gone in a few more days
If we don't stop this love of ours
From slippin' away
And I can feel it slippin' away
Slowly, slowly slippin' away
It'll be gone in a few more days
If we don't stop this love of ours
From slippin' awayI knew the moment that you walked in
You were looking for your old friend
Well here I am
It ain't no big surprise
You got a broken heart to kill
Tired of knowing how it feels
When you learn you been living
A lie
Oh, and ain't that a shame
You shouldn't feel such pain
But you can't blame no one but you, Delilah
For what you find when you never ever look around
Reach out for the one right here beside ya
And find the one that's never gonna let you down
Mmm, mmm, mmm
So go ahead and take your shot
Drink your whiskey on the rocks
And tell me how
You'll never find the one
But Lord knows it hurts me bad
Every time I see you sad
Knowing that my love
Goes on and on
Oh, it just ain't right
You're alone tonight
But you can't blame no one but you, Delilah
For what you find when you never ever look around
Reach out for the one right here beside ya
And find the one that's never gonna let you down
Mmm, mmm, mmm
You can't blame no one but you, Delilah
For what you find when you never ever look around
Reach out for the one right here beside ya
And find the one that's never gonna let you down
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I knew the moment that you walked in
You were looking for your old friend
Well, here I am
It ain't no big surpriseI can't stop your heart from breaking,
Can't make right mistakes we've made,
Can't dry your crying eyes,
For my little angels sake,
I can't make the sun keep smiling,
Or blow away the clouds,
There's some things in this old world girl,
I can't do nothing bout,
But I can love you,
Like I've always done,
And when the hard times come a knocking,
Honey you won't ever see me run,
I won't leave you,
When you need a friend,
Can't make the bad days that much better,
Baby than they've ever been,
But I can love you,
Can't hold back the ocean waves,
Or stop a sinking ship,
Can't make a mountain move,
Or tell you how to live,
But I can love you,
Like I've always done,
And when the hard times come a knocking,
Honey you won't ever see me run,
I won't leave you,
When you need a friend,
Can't make the bad days that much better,
Baby than they've ever been,
But I can love you,Well, I'm alive like a sprouting seed
Like the deepest roots of an ancient tree
I did not come here for the bread, no
I have come to wake the dead
They'll say tell us Jack what have you seen
Where will you go, now what does it mean
Come on boys, you got to do it right
Pray to the moon in the middle of the night
Come on Jack, what do you know, what have you seen, where will you go
Come on boys, I got to tell you true, I'm a stranger here just like you
I get high as the morning sky, this song I sing will never die
I get low as a gravel road, in a thousand tongues my story's told
I'm throwing heat like a funeral pyre, we can get along like a house on fire
This world she's cold, this world is mean, my heart is stone, my hands are clean
They'll say tell us Jack where will you go, what have you seen, what do you know
Come on boys, you got to do it right, pray to the moon in the middle of the night
Come on Jack what do you know, where have you seen, where will you go
Come on boys, I gotta tell you true, I'm a stranger here just like you
I get high as the morning sky, this song I sing will never die
I get low as a gravel road, in a thousand tongues my story's told
Watch me roll like an iron wheel, I can stack the deck when the spirits deal
Time cannot hold me in this cage, I'm cheating death, I jump the grave
They'll say tell us Jack, what have you seen, where will you go, what does it mean
Come on boys, you got to do it right
You better pray to the moon in the middle of the night
Come on Jack, where will you go, what have you seen, what do you know
Come on boys, I gotta tell you true, I'm a stranger here just like you
I get high as the morning sky, this song I sing will never die
I get low as a gravel road, in a thousand tongues my story's told(Dolly Parton/Bill Owens)
She married the one I love today
When my back was turned she took him away
Now while they're all outside, waiting to throw rice
What I want to throw will surely black her eyes
'Cause I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
She took the only love I had
No, I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
It would be a way to hurt her 'cause she hurt me so bad
Well I never stole nothin' in my life
But if I get the chance I'll steal him from his wife
'Cause all is fair in love and war, maybe I'm carryin' this too far
But I feel like tying dynamite to her side of the carIn the twilight glow I see
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dying ember
And only memories remain
And through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Someday soon we'll meet up yonder
And we'll walk hand in hand again
And through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Blue eyes crying in the rainI can see you are not happy the way you've been acting
And I think you'd like to be free
I know he's a good man but I know that you can be a whole lot happier with me
In your eyes there's a yearning and inside you're a burning
And I'd like to put out the flame
So let's get together like birds of a feather and we let the love take the blame
But right now I don't think that I can leave him for lately he's been so good to me
And there might be once more chance that things might work out
So let's wait a little longer then we'll see
But the way I can make you forget him cause I'll take you
To places that you've never been
We'll may call the night spots the dim and the bright spots
And then we'll forget where we've been
We'll walk sunny beaches and taste Georgia peaches and swing from Maine to Mexico
If you'll come along we can make life a song and you won't be tied down anymore
But still I don't think that I can leave him for lately he's been so good to me
And there might be once more chance that things might work out
So let's wait a little longer then we'll see yes let's wait a little longer then we'll seeMy daddy told me when I was a young girl
A lesson he learned, it was a long time ago
If you want to have someone to hold onto
You're gonna have to learn to let go
You got to sing like you don't need the money
Love like you'll never get hurt
You got to dance like nobody's watchin'
It's gotta come from the heart
If you want it to work
Now here is the one thing I keep forgettin'
When everything is falling apart
In life as in love, you know I need to remember
There's such a thing as trying too hard
You got to sing like you don't need the money
Love like you'll never get hurt
You got to dance like nobody's watchin'
It's gotta come from the heart
If you want it to workWhy should I cry over you dear when you never cried over me
You want to take without giving that's why our hearts disagree
You called our dream world a prison but from now on you'll be free
Why should I cry over you dear when you never cried over me
[ steel ]
Why should I cry over you dear...It's the little things that mean the most to me
Like wakin' up with you this close to me
Watch the sunrise, there in your eyes
Sleepy smile, tangled hair
Mornin' love, girl I swear
This is the life the one we're livin'
These are the days, we've been given
This is the love, now and forever
And we only get one chance to live it right
This is the life
Life is funny let's just laugh at it
Who knows what's comin' after it
Our days are numbered, filled with wonder
Let's raise our glass, to the years
Make love last while we're here
Oh, this is the life the one we're livin'
These are the days, we've been given
This is the love, now and forever
And we only get one chance to live it right
Oh, this is the life, this is the lifeI saw you dancing through the window
Saw you dancing to the band and it's me
I saw you messing around with an old friend
You said you didn't even see
Saw you walk on through the doorway
Saw you walking hand in hand
Saw him touching you the way lovers do
And now it won't happen again
Well, you, I think you know what I mean
That I'm not gonna stand around and play make believe
Darling, if you love me tell me baby
Was it I the one in your world who took everything that was upside down
And put it right side up for you?
When you close that door behind you
I'll carry on feeling no regrets
I'll carry the image of you and all you put me through
I'm not gonna get it out of my head
Well you I think you know what I mean
That I am not gonna stand around and play make believe
Well you I think you know what I mean
That I am not gonna stay around and play make believePut a quarter in the jukebox and let it play
That same sad song that's been playing all day
You know the one where his darling is gone
So pour the red wine play the jukebox and let the sad times roll on
Let the sad times roll on cause she's gone she's gone
So pour the red wine play the jukebox and let the sad times roll on
[Steel]
I watch as the record spins around as he tells of a love that's let him down
He's singing my life story in his song
So pour the red wine play the jukebox and let the sad times roll on
Let the sad times roll on...She sang hymns out of tune
And carried a yellow balloon
She traded her love
For a Spanish doubloon
And talked to the people
The people who are
Now I have a clock on the wall
It keeps time and that isn't all
It tells me how long she's been gone
Gone to the people
The people who are
She lived in a sorcerer's room
And pounded the table
And brandished the broom
She turned ten thousand
When she touched the moon
And turned to the people
The people who are
Waaa waa waa
Rain came down and scattered away
The old antique caretaker's children that play
Early that morning she passed away
Passed to the people The people who are
She sang!
She sang hymns out of tune
And carried a yellow balloon
She traded her love for a Spanish doubloon
And talked to the people
The people who areWell I have been a cowboy dang near all my life
That good ol' cowboy music is all I'm supposed to like
But here lately I don't know what's happening but I'm losin' control
I'm losin' control
To a little longhaired outlaw who's a ridin' somewhere deep down in my soul
He likes rock and roll
Well he rides a pinto stallion down the canyons of my mind
Makes camp beneath a memory below the timberline
Got a little electric fender guitar plugs direct into my soul
Right into my soul
Turns up the volume bends them guitar strings and plays that rock and roll
Ah and here he goes
[ guitar ]
Well I can be do a concert strummin' along just fine
Playing Little Joe The Wrangler when somethin' snaps inside my mind
And I can feel that longhaired music wellin' up from the rivers of my soul
Where the music flows
When that little longhair outlaw takes over and makes me play that rock and roll oh yeah
[ keyboards ]
Now if you like cowboy music and you don't like this song
Well I'd like to apologize if the tune kinda came out wrong
But you see I can't help myself the little longhair has got control
And he won't let go
But I'll get back to my cowboy music but sometimes you gotta play a little rock and roll
It's my turn it's about time
[ guitar ]I serve a risen Saviour, He's in the world today
I know that He is living, whatever men may say
I see His hand of mercy, I hear His voice of cheer
And just the time I need Him He's always near
He lives (He lives), He lives (He lives), Christ Jesus lives today
He walks with me and talks with me
Along life's narrow way
He lives (He lives), He lives (He lives), Salvation to impart
You ask me how I know He lives?
He lives within my heart
In all the world around me I see His loving care
And though my heart grows weary I never will despair
I know that He is leading, through all the stormy blast
The day of His appearing will come at last
He lives (He lives), He lives (He lives), Christ Jesus lives today
He walks with me and talks with me
Along life's narrow way
He lives (He lives), He lives (He lives), Salvation to impart
You ask me how I know He lives?
He lives within my heart
Rejoice, rejoice, O Christian Lift up your voice and sing
Eternal hallelujahs to Jesus Christ, the King
The Hope of all who seek Him, the Help of all who find
None other is so loving, so good and kind
He lives (He lives), He lives (He lives), Christ Jesus lives today
He walks with me and talks with me
Along life's narrow way
He lives (He lives), He lives (He lives), Salvation to impart
You ask me how I know He lives?
He lives within my heartI open my door and heres what occurs.
A pretty little gal with pretty little curls.
Leans to the side, leans on my mind.
I dont want to live, but I sure dont want to die.
Im stuttering again and tellin' her goodbye.
Oh m-m-my, Goodb-b-bye
Will you come again? Its hard to say.
I surely hope so.
Will you come again? Its hard to say.
I surely hope so.
She walks up to me with something more to say.
Then hello and goodbye I hope that youre okay.
Well Im doing fine Im doing fine.
Will you come again? Its hard to say.
I surely hope so.
Will you come again? Its hard to say.
I surely hope so.
I wish youd see yourself as beautiful as I see you
Why cant you see yourself as beautiful as I see you?
I open my door and this is what I see.
The hope inside a girl just looking back at me.
Ohh my Goodbye
Will you come again? Its hard to say.
I surely hope so.
And will you come again? Its hard to say.
I surely hope so.Lord I ain't no stranger now
Lord I ain't no stranger now
I've been introduced to the Father and the Son
Lord I ain't no stranger now
Cryin' holy unto my Lord
Cryin holy unto my Lord
Lord if I could I surely would
Stand on that rock where Moses stood
Sinners run and hide your face
Sinners run and hide your face
Run to the rocks and hide your face
The rocks won't have no hiding placeI remember when my heart caught the fever
You were standing all alone in the summer heat
I was with my boyfriend, new boyfriend
He was as sweet as he could be
One look at you and I was through
My heart switched up on me
Like a postcard from Paris
When I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond
Was from her old promise ring
Coming back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is come around
And now I'm ruined
(I'm ruined)
In the evening you can catch me daydreaming
Did that moment send you reeling just like me
I should've gone over, right over
I should've never let you leave
But it's the never knowing that keeps this going
And drives me crazy
Like a postcard from Paris
When I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond
Was from her old promise ring
Come back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is come around
Just when I thought things were alright
My eyes played tricks on my mind
Will I ever be satisfied
'Cause all I ever seem to find
Is a postcard from Paris
When I need the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond
Is from an old promise ring
Come back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did
The cruelest thing you ever did
The meanest thing you ever did is come around
I am ruined
I'm ruined
I am ruined, yeah
I am ruined, yeah(Don't you touch me if you don't love me)
Your hand is like a torch each time you touch me
That look in your eyes pulls me apart
Don't open the door to heaven if I can't come in
Don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart
Your kiss is like a drink when I'm thirsty
And I'm thirsty for you with all my heart
Don't love me then act as though we've never kissed
Don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheart
Don't give me something that you might take away
To have you then lose you wouldn't be smart on my part
Don't open the door to heaven if I can't come in
Don't touch me if you don't love me sweetheartThe day she left I told myself she could be replaced
All the memories that she leaves they could be erased
But since she's been gone I sing a different song
For nothing is working out for me
Her empty chair or the pillow where she would lay her head
Brings to my mind the happy times before goodbyes were said
She's on my mind each morning it just stays the long day through
And I miss her say I love you
In every room of this house she left her memory
In every dream that I dream she walks and talks with me
So how can I forget her and say that I don't care
When she's all around me she's everywhere
Oh how can I forget her and say that I don't care
When she's all around me all the time she's everywhereOh, somewhere the music's playing soft and low
And a stranger holds the one that I love so
I was blind I could not see that you meant the world to me
But like a fool I stood and watched you go
Now I'm crying my heart out over you
Those blue eyes now they smile at someone new
Ever since you went away I die a little more each day
For I'm crying my heart out over you
Each night I climb the stairs up to my room
It seems I hear you whisper in the gloom
I miss your picture on the wall and your footsteps in the hall
While I'm crying my heart out over you
Now I'm crying my heart out over you
Those blue eyes now they smile at someone new
Ever since you went away I die a little more each day
For I'm crying my heart out over youHigh a top a mountain lookin' down to Panga Canyon
I came to see the blue pacific in the night
The stars are like a miollion dancin' diamods on the water
And my lover's arms're wrapped around me tight
And almost empty bottle of rose sits on the table
Like the echo of a sweet and gentle song
I never stop and wonder why I came to California
But I often wonder why I took so long
Meanwhile back in Cleveland her alarm clock's loudly ringin'
And she's crawlin' out to face another day
A sleepy little boychild is tuggin' her pyjamas sayin' mama why did daddy go away
But it's Saturday and it's bowlin' den and then the beauty parlor
And the wishy-washy laundry and then home
And California's just a piece of fiction on her roadmap
And surely not the place her man has gone meanwhile back in Cleveland life goes on
The waves at Malibou today were perfect for the surfin'
And I hope I didn't soak up too much sun
We started once to take a boat to Catalina Island
But lyin' on the beach was too much fun
There's gonna be the screaming Sunday night at Universal
And a party up at Roger's place till dawn
I never stop and wonder why I came to California
But I often woder why I took so long
Meanwhile back in Cleveland the rain is slowly fallin'
And it's gonna be another lonely night
Someone said she's workin' in a cafe waitin' tables
And I'm sorry and I hope that she's alright
But the endless maze of PTA's and queus and station wagons
And cuttin' grass and highly mortgaged homes
Drove me from the lovin' arms I otherwise would die for
And make me seek a purpose of my own meanwhile back in Cleveland life goes onI can still remember
Every song you played
Long ago when we were younger
And we'd rock the night away
How could I see your future then
Where you would not grow old
With such a fire in our bellies
Such a hunger in our souls.
I guess I probably loved you
When those words rolled off your tongue
It seemed that we were travelin'
Under some ol' lucky sun
I know I couldn't save you
And no one was to blame
But the road we shared together once
Will never be the same
Hey, hey gonna fly away
Won't be coming round today
Hey, hey with a song I pray
And on the wings of a song I'll fly away.
I wandered in the wilderness
For a while I was so lost
To everything there is a season
And every blessing has it's cost
So I took what you left me
And put it to some use
Went looking for an answer
With those three cords and the truth
I come down from the mountain
I come walkin' in your shoes
I was taken for a gambler
When I had no more to lose
'Cause you put me on that pathway
How could I refuse?
And I spend my whole life out here
Workin' on the blues
So I carried on.
You can't be haunted by the past.
People come and people go.
And nothing ever lasts.
But I still think about you
Wonder where you are
Can you see me from some place
Up there among the stars
But down here under heaven
There never was a chart
To guide our way across
This crooked highway of the heart
And if it's only all about
The journey in the end
On that road I'm glad I came to know
My old friend.
Hey
Gone away
Won't be coming round again
Hey
With a song I pray
And on the wings of a song
I'll fly away
I'll fly away
I'll fly awayNo more floors to walk no more walls to talk
No more dreams to dream no more schemes to scheme
No more happiness only loneliness no more skies of blue no more me and you
No more lips to kiss no more arms to miss no more jealous fights only sleepless nights
No more friends to face love's gone without a trace
No more skies of blue no more me and youNow freight train keeps rolling and leaves a riding to be
There's folks in Natchez that I'm longing to see
The wide cotton's growing and the magnolia's in bloom
Just ten miles from Natchez that's where I'll be making my home
Got a lettter from sister she said they miss me at home
The farm is neglected cause papa can't work at the loam
Now they held this mailing mama's hair's turning grey
Just ten miles from Natchez and I'll be back with them to stay
[ dobro ]
I wanted to ramble you know how a young boy would dream
Off to Chicago searching for fortune and fame
Spent many long nights with the hoboes down by the track
Homesick in Natchez and too much proud to go back
I went to Alaska searching the mountains for gold
I might have stayed but the winters there are so cold
Went down to old Frisco work on the docks for a while
I was doing all right till this bound freight caught my eye
Just ten miles from Natchez that's where I'll be making my homeDon't you fall in love with me
Don't show me your affection
I can't give you what you want from me
I don't want the attention
I gave away my heart before
And it only caused me sorrow
How could I think of loving someone
Today or tomorrow
I've been so long confused
Was I loved or was I used?
Now the sun goes up and down
And the weather rains and shines
I lost my heart somewhere
Oh, I need to take more timeYou stirred up a breeze that felt like heaven
As you walked by
And when you smiled and handed me your number
You changed my life
What could I do but call
Face it girl it's all your fault
You'll never hear the end of it
Girl I'll never get tired
Of sayin' I love you
I'll say it and then
I'll say it again
You'll never hear the end of it
I can promise that I'll never leave you
Room for doubt
Nothing's ever gonna come between us
We can't work out
Our love will go on
Until forever has come and gone
You'll never hear the end of it
Girl I'll never get tired
Of sayin' I love you
I'll say it and then
I'll say it again
You'll never hear the end of it
I don't have a choice
I hope you like
The sound of my voice
You'll never hear the end of it
Girl I'll never get tired
Of sayin' I love you
I'll say it and then
I'll say it again
You'll never hear the end of it
You'll never hear the end of itThe fact that she's gone has become very real
Is this really hurt or regret that I feel
All of the things that you're so sorry for
Aren't things you can change
She's not yours anymore
You cheated on her and although she knew
She swallowed her pride and kept loving you
You promised to change but she'd heard that before
Now it's out of your hands
She's not yours anymore
So now you know
Now that you're free
What she meant to you
She now means to me
You were so sure that she wouldn't go
You made the mistake of telling her so
But now that she's gone
You have heartaches in store
So live with it friend
She's not yours anymore[ Both ]
Forever and ever I'll love you I swear by the stars up above you
There never will be any other I'll love you forever and ever
[ Merle ]
The sun in the sky may stop shining and the salty old sea may run dry
[ Bonnie ]
The Man in the Moon may stop smiling but I'll always be by your side
[ Both ]
Forever and ever I'll love you...
[ Bonnie ]
No other lips ever will kiss me no other arms ever will hold me
[ Merle ]
No other heart ever will miss me I'll love you forever and ever
[ Both ]
Forever and ever I'll love you...When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
All those pretty faces always made you stand out from the crowd
Someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to go and take a second look
Oh baby give me one more chance
Won't you please let me in your heart
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
Now that I see you in his arms
I want you back
I want you back
I want you back
Trying to live without your love
Is like one long sleepless night
Let me show you boy
That I really know, I know wrong from right
Cause every street you're walking on
You leave tear stains on the ground
Follow boy, I didn't even want
Didn't even want you around
Oh baby give me one more chance
To show you I love you
Won't you please let me in your heart
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
Let you go baby
Now that I see you in his arms
Oh now that I see you in his arms
I want you back
I want you back
I want you backEspecially with my head pounding
and lying helpless in my bed
I long for you and your expert hands
To ease this white heat from my head
And you would boast that you knew
All the pressure points inside
And you could just as easily kill me
Beneath the desire that I hide
But as your patient I knew
That your healing powers had grown
From a sore that's far far deeper
Than this heart where the pain was born
With my head again clear
I think of words to send to you
To coax you back to my side
But always leave out "I love you"Se eu pudesse te contar
Como eu sofro noite e dia
Se eu soubesse onde estÃ¡s
Ao teu lado eu voltaria
Faz um ano que eu choro, noite-dia
Faz um ano que eu padeÃ§o de saudade, vida minha
Faz um ano que eu choro, noite-dia
Faz um ano que eu padeÃ§o de saudade, vida minha
Ainda existe a palmeira lÃ¡ na gruta trÃªs-maria
Tua sombra, nosso abrigo, nos domingos de tardinha
No tronco da palmeira, jÃ¡ estÃ¡ se apagando
Os versos de amor que escrevemos dentro de um coraÃ§Ã£o
Mais um dia que se acaba
Outra noite se aproxima
Um suspiro que anuncia outra lÃ¡grima perdida
Faz um ano que eu choro, noite-e-dia
Faz um ano que eu padeÃ§o de saudade, vida minha
Faz um ano que eu choro, noite-dia
Faz um ano que eu padeÃ§o de saudade, vida minhaAnd I called you back to a place beside me
And I called you back to a place beside me
Love found us easily
And if that's all we have you will find we need nothing more
And I called you back to a place beside me
And I called you back to a place beside me
And every time we kiss
We find ourselves in love again
And the older that we get
We know that nothing else for us is possible
And I called you back to a place beside me
And I called you back to a place beside me
Mm, when I was quiet
Well, I heard your voice in everything
And I called you back to a place beside me
And I called you back to a place beside me
And I called you back to a place beside meI'm not the kind to take things for granted
A simple mind and two strong working hands
But at the time I thought my feet were planted
You came along and uprooted this simple man
A strong-willed woman with every chance to show it
But I didn't mind 'cause you made my life worthwhile
A beautiful woman with every reason to know it
You liked my courage and honey I sure liked your style
A country boy and city girl makin' life in this old world
We went against the grain and against all odds
It don't matter what they say, I'm gonna love you anyway
And time won't undo what you've gone and done to my heart
I always thought we'd stay together
And I still think about you from time to time
But I should have known nothing lasts forever
But I'd never be the one to say goodbye
And I rememberSince you and I parted in silence and tears
So broken hearted we've suffered for years
Your cheek was pale and your hand was so cold
I remember you saying as you turned to go
That I'd cry in my sleep and your name I would call
Your face I would see every night on my wall
That I'd waken in the morning in tears to recall
You're tellin' me darling so long long ago
[ steel - guitar ]
If we should meet after long lonely years if I should greet you with silence and tears
But if I'd reach to touch you oh so you will know
I remember you're tellin' me long long ago
That I'd cry in my sleep...
I remember you darling from long long agoA word or two to Mary please write a letter for me
That's what my buddy said to me today
I couldn't keep from crying sad eyes're looking at me
He said I'll tell you what I wanted to say
Oh I don't mind dyin' I just hate to leave you alone
And I wish that I could watch the children grow
But there's no use denyin' I won't be coming back home
Just a word or two to you before I go
Down on my knees beside him I begged my buddy to live
I told the Lord to please take me instead
But a word or two to Mary was all my buddy could give
And just these words were all your husband said
Oh I don't mind dyin'...
[ steel ]
A word or two to Mary I must have some of my own
He was the truest friend I ever had
I'll keep writing letters to her help the children along
Tell them in a way that it's from their dad
He didn't mind dyin' he just hated to leave you alone
And he wished that he could see his children grow
I'll be standing by 'em as I know he'd want me to
And write a word or two to Mary as they grow
And write a word or two to Mary as they growIt's funny how love goes
'Cause I know this could never work out
But honey, how love grows
Even though there's no reason to doubt
This can never be
You keep saying it's wrong
Neither one of us is free
Still I want to hold on
When even a fool would let go
'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying
Even a child would say no
When he knows that he'll end up crying
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you
Even a fool would let go
Love has no reason
Like the words in a song that don't rhyme
My love has no season
I just know that it's there all the time
Maybe just you and me
I can't believe that it's wrong
Thinking about you and me
Just makes me want to hold on
When even a fool would let go
'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying
Even a child would say no
When he knows that he'll end up crying
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you
Even a fool would let goI was feelin' lonely
And I was new in town
I was only lookin' for a friend
But when the music started
And I saw you in the crowd
My heart just opened up and let you in
Oh I just came here to dance
I didn't want a lover
I just came here to dance
And look what I discovered
I was caught up in the music
And I was captured
By the magic in your eyes
I wasn't lookin' for romance
I just came here to dance
I may be actin' crazy
And maybe I'm insane
To lose my heart so easily
But when we started dancin'
And you held me in your arms
I don't know what came over me
Oh I just came here to dance
I didn't want a lover
I just came here to dance
And look what I discovered
I was caught up in the music
And I was captured by the magic
In your eyes
I wasn't lookin' for romance
I just came here to dance
Oh, it felt so right
With the jukebox lights
Spinnin' 'round and 'round
When the night was through
It was me and you
And a new love we'd foundWell, I changed my ways to please that woman
But I could never be good enough
I gave up drinkin' and took up churchin'
And for awhile it wasn't tough
But barkeep I've made a decision
After doing the best I could
That for better or worse
I'm gonna be bad for good
So bring on the whiskey
Turn up the jukebox loud
These boots were made for tonkin'
Warn every woman around
I'm gonna wind it up tonight
A little tighter than I should
Yeah, for better or worse
I'm gonna be bad for good
I really like my reputation
And how I'm known all over town
Of being the first in my generation
To close every single honky tonk down
I'm gonna be a tough act to follow
Doin' what I said I would
Yeah, for better or worse
I'm gonna be bad for good
So bring on the whiskey
Turn up the jukebox loud
These boots were made for tonkin'
Warn every woman around
I'm gonna wind it up tonight
A little tighter than I should
Yeah, for better or worse
I'm gonna be bad for good
Oh, somebody be bad
I'm gonna wind it up tonight
A little tighter that I should
Yeah, for better or worse
I'm gonna be bad for good
Yeah, for better or worse
I'm gonna be bad for goodLife's like poetry and in my poem bay
Until now there's always been a missing line
You know life's too short to hide a good thing you feel
And I find the morning after
Is the best time to determine if it's real
Baby, finding you gave my whole world reason to rhyme
'Cause life's like poetry and in my poem bay
Until now there's always been a missing line
Life's too short to think about right or wrong
And the only thing I wonder 'bout
Is where you been so long
'Cause baby finding you gave my whole world reason and rhyme
And life's like poetry and in my poem bay
Until now there's always been a missing line
Until now, there's always been a missing lineI was snappin' out broncs at the Old Flyin' you
At forty a month a plum good buckaroo
Well, the boss comes around and he says, hey my lad
Well, you look pretty good ridin' horses that's bad
You see, I ain't got no more outlaws to break
But I'll buy you a ticket and I'll give you a stake
At ridin' them bad ones, well, you ain't slow
And you might do some good at the big rodeo
While they're puttin' the bull in the chute
I'm strappin' my spurs to the heels of my boots
I looks that bull over and to my surprise
Well, he's a foot and a half in between his two eyes
On top of his shoulders, he's got a big hump
I cinched up my rigging just back of that lump
I lands in his middle and I lets out a scream
He comes out with a beller and the rest is a dream
Well, he jumps to the left and he lands towards the right
But I ain't no green horn, I'm still sittin' tight
The dust starts to foggin' right out of his skin
He's a wavin' them horns right under my chin
At sunnin' his belly, he couldn't be beat
He's a showin' the buzzards the soles of his feet
He's a dippin' so low that my boots filled with dirt
He's a makin' a whip of the tail of my shirt
He's a snappin' the buttons right off of my clothes
He's a buckin' and a bawlin' and a blowin' his nose
The crowd starts to cheerin' both me and that bull
Well, he needed no help but I had my hands full
Then he goes to fence rowin' and weavin' behind
My head went poppin', I sorta went blind
He starts in high divin', I lets out a groan
We went up together but he come back alone
Up high I turns over and below I can see
He's a pawin' up dirt just a waitin' for me
I can picture a grave and a big slab of wood
Sayin' here lies a twister who thought he was good
I notices somethin' don't seem can be true
But the brand on his hip was a Big Flyin' you
When I landed, he charged but I got enough sense
So I ran that old bull to the hole in the fence
I dives through that hole and I want you to know
I ain't goin' back to no big rodeo
At a straddlin' them Brahmas, you can bet I'm all through
I'm sore footin' it back to the Old Flyin' youTHE LOVING KIND
WRITERS ROGER BOWLING, LARRY BUTLER
Somewhere I heard these words one time
Love is like a clinging vine
Wrap me 'round your heart
And 'round your mind
I've never had to cling to you
'Cause I have no fear of losin' you
Our love is not a clinging vine
It's the lovin' kind
Somewhere I let read these words one time
Love is like a glass of wine
Aging made it sweeter and so fine
It's no better now than before
'Cause we've got the best and there's nothin' more
Our love is not a glass of wine
It's the lovin' kind
Let them write their fancy words
For people who have never heard or tasted
A love like yours and mine
Ours is not a clinging vine
And its certainly not a glass of wine
It's love
And our love is the lovin' kind
Our love is not a clinging vine
And its certainly not a glass of wine
It's love
And our love is the lovin' kindI go out walking after midnight
Out in the moonlight just like we used to do
I'm going walking after midnight searching for you
I walk for miles along the highway
Well that's just my way of saying I love you
I'm going walking after midnight searching for you
I stop to see a weeping willow crying on the pillow maybe he's crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy nighttime whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be
I go out walking after midnight out in the moonlight just a hoping you may be
Somewhere a walking after midnight searching for me
I stop to see a weeping willowMother Nature's opened up the door
To lots of things I never saw before
It's a lovely, lovely world since I've met you
Never did see everything lookin' so nice
I just learned the meanin' of paradise
It's a lovely, lovely world since I've met you
Now the sun shines brighter
And the skies are a little bit bluer
And my little, old, rattle, trap Ford Coupe
Even seems a little bit newer
Well, my guitar stays a little better in tune
The stars shine brighter, there's honey on the moon
It's a lovely, lovely world since I've met you
Ever since you cuddled in my embrace
I've had more faith in the human race
It's a lovely, lovely world since I've met you
Now, I don't mind workin' and slavin' all day
'Cause I know tonight there'll be love to pay
It's a lovely, lovely world since I've met you
Everything seems natural and right
Since the day I found you
Everything looks rosy and shiny bright
In the dreams I'm buildin' around you
Used to think that miracles would never come true
But now I'm happy 'cause I know they do
It's a lovely, lovely world since I've met youTwice as blue without you I'm just twice as blue today
You didn't treat me right so I thought I might as well just go away
Oh perhaps I could forget you but no matter what I'd do
Seems that I still find you on my mind and now I'm twice as blue
I said who was true what else could I do you made my life so sad
But I know through today I'd take you any old way and I feel just half this bad
Cause I'm twice as blue without you as I never was before
Now I knew you'd win cause here I am again a knocking at your door
[ guitar ]
I said who was true...
A knocking at your doorYou're headin' for heartaches by playin' around
You know as well as I that a new love can't be found
You're headin' for heartaches so don't you be surprised
When there's no one there to dry the teardrops in your eyes
You're headin' for heartaches I'm warnin' you now
Does he mean so much to you that you'd break all our vows
You're headin' for heartaches oh, don't you realize
That maybe he is telling you a bunch of little lies
You're headin' for heartaches now that you've made up your mind
You believed in someone else who's love would be so kind
You're headin' for heartaches and it won't be very long
Till I have someone else to love and you left all aloneTo the man that waited on me at the Starbucks down on Main, I hope you understand
When I put on that t-shirt, the only thing I meant to say is I'm a Skynyrd fan
The red flag on my chest somehow is like the elephant in the corner of the south
And I just walked him right in the room
Just a proud rebel son with an 'ol can of worms
Lookin' like I got a lot to learn but from my point of view
I'm just a white man comin' to you from the southland
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
We're still pickin' up the pieces, walkin' on eggshells, fightin' over yesterday
And caught between southern pride and southern blame
They called it Reconstruction, fixed the buildings, dried some tears
We're still siftin' through the rubble after a hundred-fifty years
I try to put myself in your shoes and that's a good place to begin
But it ain't like I can walk a mile in someone else's skin
'Cause I'm a white man livin' in the southland
Just like you I'm more than what you see
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
And we're still paying for the mistakes
That a bunch of folks made long before we came
And caught between southern pride and southern blame
Dear Mr. White Man, I wish you understood
What the world is really like when you're livin' in the hood
Just because my pants are saggin' doesn't mean I'm up to no good
You should try to get to know me, I really wish you would
Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood
I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood
I want you to get paid but be a slave I never could
Feel like a new fangled Django, dodgin' invisible white hoods
So when I see that white cowboy hat, I'm thinkin' it's not all good
I guess we're both guilty of judgin' the cover not the book
I'd love to buy you a beer, conversate and clear the air
But I see that red flag and I think you wish I wasn't here
I'm just a white man
(If you don't judge my do-rag)
Comin' to you from the southland
(I won't judge your red flag)
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from
(If you don't judge my gold chains)
But not everything we've done
(I'll forget the iron chains)
It ain't like you and me can re-write history
(Can't re-write history baby)
Oh, Dixieland
(The relationship between the Mason-Dixon needs some fixin')
I hope you understand what this is all about
(Quite frankly I'm a black Yankee but I've been thinkin' about this lately)
I'm a son of the new south
(The past is the past, you feel me)
And I just want to make things right
(Let bygones be bygones)
Where all that's left is southern pride
(RIP Robert E. Lee but I've gotta thank Abraham Lincoln for freeing me, know what I mean)
It's real, it's real
It's truthIt's too late, you say you want me, but it's too late
Once my love for you was so great
But it's too late to love me now
It's too late to love me now
It's too bad, you say you need me and it's too bad
I know the feelin' and it's so sad
But it's too late to love me now
It's too late to love me now
Don't you know how hard I tried to hold out just for you
Lovin' you from memory day by day
Then someone came into my life and turned my dreams around
And he's taken all the love you turned away
It's too late, you say you want me, but it's too late
Once my love for you was so great
But it's too late to love me now
It's too late to love me nowSo long fellas, I gotta go
Told her I wasn't gonna be, but an hour or so
I know she's bound to worry, 'bout me and that old car
It's not that she don't trust me,
But you know how women are
A few weeks back, they took my job
The money's tight, time's are gonna be hard
I know what's on her mind, but she ain't said a word so far
She's tryin' not to let it show,
But you know how women are
She's stands right beside me, win or lose
She'll reach deep down inside and find a way to pull me through
She can see the silver lining, in the darkest of news
She loves to hear me say "I love you", whispered in the dark
YOu know how women are
Sent her flowers, the other day
We had words, and you know I had my say
I knew right then that I was wrong, I thought "Damn, my foolish heart"
Because she means the world to me,
And you know how women are
She's stands right beside me, win or lose
She'll reach deep down inside and find a way to pull me through
She can see the silver lining, in the darkest of news
She loves to hear me say "I love you", whispered in the dark
You know how women are
So long fellas, you know are women areThis old house is falling down around my ears
I'm drowning in a river of my tears
When all my will is gone you hold me sway
I need you at the dimming of the day
You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide
You know just where I keep my better side
What days have come to keep us far apart
A broken promise or a broken heart
Now all the bonnie birds have wheeled away
I need you at the dimming of the day
Come the night you're only what I want
Come the night you could be my confidant
Come the night you're only what I want
Come the night you could be my confidant
I see you on the street in company
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me
I'm living for the night we steal away
I need you at the dimming of the day
I need you at the dimming of the day(Dolly Parton)
The greatest gift, the gift of life
The gift of love divine
God gave us all a special gift
He meant for it to shine
He meant for it to shine
The darkest night can be made light
By one bright word or smile
If we'd put on our neighbor's shoes
And choose to walk a mile
God gave us all our own free will
To choose the paths we take
No greater deed could e'er be done
Than for another's sake
The greatest gift, the gift of life
The gift of love divine
God gave us all a special gift
He meant for it to shine
He meant for it to shine
Shine on, shine on, for all to see
God's light inside your soul
Shine on, shine on, let love flow free
Warm others in its glow
Shine on, shine on, shine on
So hide it not or it will fade
Shine on, shine on, shine on
Shine on, shine on, shine on
The greatest gift, the gift of life
The gift of love divine
God gave us all a special gift
He meant for it to shine
Shine on, shine on, shine onYoung lovers in a picture frame
Ever notice how there ain't no rain
Nobody hangs hard times on the wall
You won't see it in an 8 by 10
But there's a storm every now and then
A slamming door down the hall
Sometimes love is a white flag
Sometimes love is standing tall
Sometimes love is a feather
Sometimes a cannon ball
But it's worth fighting for (it's worth fighting for)
Baby, sometimes love is war
An old couple on a front porch swing
On a walk down memory lane
Been through the fire and back again
Through the clear and the cloudy skies
Still love in each other's eyes
Sometimes love is war but sometimes you win
Sometimes love is a white flag
Sometimes love is standing tall
Sometimes love is a feather
Sometimes a cannon ball
And it's worth fighting for (yeah, it's worth fighting for)
Baby, sometimes love is war
Sometimes love is all that can save us
Sometimes love can kill a man
Yeah sometimes love is a soft touch
Or a pistol in your hand
Sometimes love is a white flag
Sometimes love is standing tall
Sometimes love is a feather
Sometimes a cannon ball
But it's worth fighting for (it's worth fighting for)
Baby, sometimes love is
Baby, sometimes love is warO COME ALL YE FAITHFULL
Writers Frederick Oakeley, John Francis Wade, John Reading
O come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant, O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem. Come and behold Him, born the King of Angels. O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord. Sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation O sing, all ye bright hosts of heaven above, Glory to God, glory in the highest, O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord. Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning, Jesus, to Thee be all glory giv'n. Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing, O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.Back about eighteen hundred and some a Louisiana couple had a red headed son
No name soothe him Jim Jack or Joe they just called him Billy Bayou
Billy Billy Bayou watch where you go you're walkin' on quick sand and walk slow
Billy Billy Bayou watch what you say a pretty girl'll get you one of these days
Billy was a boy kinda big for a size red hair and freckles and big blue eyes
Thirteen years from the day he was born Billy fought the battle of the Little Big Horn
Billy Billy Bayou...
One said day Billy cried ho-ho I can whip the feathers of Geronimo
He smarted off the chief got mad this nearly ended our Louisiana lad
Billy Billy Bayou...
One day in eighteen-seventy-eight a pretty girl walked through Bill's front gate
He didn't know whether to stand there and run
He would up married cause he did neighter one
Billy Billy Bayou...
A pretty girl'll get you one of these daysOh I'm so homesick all I do is roam the street
Can't sleep at night can't eat a bite homesick to be with you
I'm so homesick I'm going crazy and I don't know what to do
Too ashamed to cry too sick to die I'm homesick to be with you
Little by little I guess I'm just losin' my mind
And I know why it's cause I haven't been home in too long a time
But I'm gonna be home soon I'll be home if I have to come in a box
'Cause I'm homesick just plain homesick for you
I'm so homesick I'm going crazy and I don't know what to do
Can't sleep can't eat just roam the street homesick to be with you
Yes I'm homesick to be with you(Heart oh heart I know it's ended)
I see you made the morning paper the story was on the social page
I read the notice of your wedding and I saw his picture in my place
I turned the pages of the paper trying to hide my foolish pride
I read the funnies with a heartache the funnies were so funny that I cry
Turning the pages I pretended that you'd still belong to me
Heart oh heart I know it's ended and I must face reality
I tore your picture from the paper with every right up I could find
I destroyed the morning paper cause it destroyed this heart of mine
Heart oh heart I know it's ended the morning paper told us all(Now and then there's a fool such as I)
Pardon me, if I'm sentimental
When we say goodbye
Don't be angry with me should I cry
When you're gone, yet I'll dream
A little dream as years go by
Now and then there's a fool such as I
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now
You say that we are through
I'm a fool, but I'll love you dear
Until the day I die
Now and then there's a fool such as I
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love
And now you say that we are through
I'm a fool, but I'll love you dear
Until the day I die
Now and then there's a fool such as I
Now and then there's a fool such as I
Now and then there's a fool such as IEcho Road, Echo Road
Stretching far and wide
Moments of my life with every mile of Echo Road
When I was eight years old
I read stories of Superman
But he had nothing on my dad, my hero of Echo Road
Said son I want you to know, my lungs are filled with kryptonite
He never made it through the night, I sat and cried
On echo road
Echo Road, Echo Road
Stretching far and wide
The Moments of my life with every mile of Echo Road
Mom had a heart of gold
And loneliness got the best of her
Thought a man was the only cure, there were nights when she'd come home
And could see in her eyes there was something wrong
Echo Road, Echo Road
Stretching far and wide
The Moments of my life with every mile of Echo Road
Echo Road, Echo Road
The man coming around -
Held my mother to the ground and she cried out to Echo Road
Oh Echo Road, what's a boy to do
I grabbed the old twenty-two and a shot rang out down Echo Road
Echo Road, Echo Road
Stretching far and wide
The moments of my life with every mile of Echo Road
With every mile of Echo RoadPapa was a simple man papa loved his farming land
Guess I didn't understand please forgive me papa
You can't paint a picture of a man like papa with something as empty as words
'Cause there's no way to measure the thoughness of timber
And compare it to the softness of birds
Papa was both and yet he was neither just a hard working God fearing soul
He gave what he had to the ones that he loved and I guess he loved me best of all
For I was the oldest and we were the closest we worked that old farm side by side
I guess that's the reason it hit me the hardest the morning that my papa died
All I could think of was how hard he'd worked and what little comfort he'd found
I guess that's the reason I hitched up the mule and drove the old buggy to town
I picked out a lot in the big cemetery in the shade of a tall maple tree
Figured it's the least I could do for my papa
After all the things that he's done for me
We gave him a funeral fit for a king and then we laid him to rest in the sod
Somehow I thought that in that big pretty place he just might feel closer to God
The women were crying as they passed by papa the men stopped and all shook my hand
Most of the mourness had gone when I looked up and noticed this white haired old man
He was dressed kinda shabby and he walked with a cane his voice was shaky and low
I had to look twice before I rocognized him he used to work for us a long time ago
They told me this morning that the big boss had died
And I thought that I should come around
I went out to the homeplace to tell him goodbye
They told me that you done brought him to town
I remember your papa used to say that when he died he didn't have but one request
He wanted to be burried out dare on that farm
He said there wadn't nowhere else that he could rest
When I heard what you'd done I fatched me a shovel found me an old paper sack
I scooped up some dirt from up near the farmhouse
And thought that I'd just bring it back
I hope you don't mind if I just sorta scatter these few little pieces of clay
It ain't gonna mess up your pretty green grass he just might sleep better this way
Guess I didn't understand please forgive me papaAt every glance, you steal from me
I catch your eyes still offering
Ill-got desire bought with deceit
'Cause borrowed love ain't never free
I vainly swear in my starved mind
To crave your look only one more time
And pray not to reap what we might sow
If borrowed love should start to grow
Borrowed love, not yours for givin'
Borrowed love, not mine to seek
Borrowed love, this road we're takin'
Toward one another's awful steep
Forgiveness for what passion wreaks
Bears a hurtful cost that don't come cheap
Its wages paid with misery
'Cause borrowed love ain't never freeEverywhere I go reminds me
Of someplace down in Texas
And every time I close my eyes
I dream of my old home
And oh it's gettin' so cold 'round here
There's too many cars 'round here
And though I want to open up my heart
There's too many parties
Everyone I know reminds me
Of someone down in Texas
And every strip mall on the highway
Reminds me of my home
And oh I'm tired of roamin' round
There's too many goin' down
And though I want to open up my heart
There's too many parties
Every time I close my eyes
I dream of someone in Texas
And every strip mall along the highway
Reminds me of my home
And oh it's gettin' so cold 'round here
There's too many cars 'round here
And though I want to open up my heart
There's too many parties
And oh it's always so cold 'round here
There's too many cars 'round here
And though I want to open up my heart
There's too many parties
There's too many cars 'round here...
There's too many cars 'round here...
There's too many cars 'round here...
And too many parties...
And too many parties...
And too many parties...Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate, break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today
[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Tennessee to those LA nights
The San Antone' to Vegas lights
Knock me down get back up again
You're in my blood I'm not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
Road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors
[Chorus: x2]
There was a distance between you and I
A misunderstanding once but now
We look it in the eye
There's no load I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors
[Chorus: x3]Three weeks in Phoenix one night to go
You're lookin' too good and you're standing to close
That song on the jukebox
Your dance-with-me smile
Has got me thinkin' of someone
I haven't seen in a while
You sure know how to make a man lonesome
I see so much of my woman in you
You sure know how to make a man lonesome
But she knows how to keep her man true
Yes, I know that it's early
Why am I leaving so soon
Well, it's too warm in here
And it's me not the room
And the way that you're starin'
I've seen that look before
You're makin' me want her all that much more
You sure know how to make a man lonesome
I see so much of my woman in you
You sure know how to make a man lonesome
But she knows how to keep her man trueI read the headlines
I see the hard times
I wonder if we'll survive
But I know there's no worries
With just one look in your eyes
I work 40 hours to bring home a dollar
At times it barely keeps us alive
But I know there's no worries
With just one look in your eyes
With just one look in your eyes
I see someone who believes in me
Till the end through thick and thin
With just one look in your eyes
I know, no matter how far down I go
You lift me up, up, again
With just one look in your eyes
One look in your eyes
So I make you a promise
When it rains down on us
We'll always have blue skies
I know there's no worries
With just one look in your eyes
With just one look in your eyes
I see someone who believes in me
Till the end through thick and thin
With just one look in your eyes
I know, no matter how far down I go
You lift me up, up, again
With just one look in your eyes
One look in your eyes
With just one look in your eyes
With just one look in your eyes
I know there's no worries
With just one look in your eyesWell my baby's wearin' a permanent smile
A satisfied look I ain't seen for a while
I ain't had no rings, fulfilled any dreams
But somethin's come over my baby it seems
I've got a funny feeling, somebody's stealin' my honey
Lord, I love that child, love to see her smile
But these circumstances ain't funny
Where lies a danger, is he a stranger or a pal
I've got a funny feeling, somebody's stealing my gal
If I came home early, Lord, what would I find?
Maybe I'd rather just walk around blind
I know baby loves me, Lord, I understand
I know how emotions can get out of hand
I've got a funny feeling, somebody's stealin' my honey
Lord, I love that child, love to see her smile
But these circumstances ain't funny
Where lies a danger, is he a stranger or a pal
I've got a funny feeling, somebody's stealing my gal
Wherever he is, well, I'm callin' his bluff
I'm gonna start wearin' that good smellin' stuff
And I'll be the lover that I used to be
Whatever she's missin', she'll get it from me
I've got a funny feeling, somebody's stealin' my honey
Lord, I love that child, love to see her smile
But these circumstances ain't funny
Where lies a danger, is he a stranger or a pal
I've got a funny feeling, somebody's stealing my gal
I've got a funny feeling, somebody's stealing my galDo not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
On this, our weddin' day
Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
Wait, wait along
I do not know what fate awaits me
I only know I must be brave
And I must face a man who hates me
Or lie a coward, a craven coward
Or lie a coward in my grave
Oh, to be torn 'tweenst love and duty
Supposin' I lose my fair-haired beauty
Look at that big hand move along
Nearin' high noon
He made a vow while in state prison
Vowed it would be my life or his, and
I'm not afraid of death, but, oh
What will I do if you leave me?
Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
You made that promise as a bride
Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
Although you're grievin', don't think of leavin'
Now that I need you by my side
Wait along (wait along), wait along
Wait along, wait along
(Wait along, wait along, wait along, wait along)I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got
In a hundred million years, I'll never stop
'Cause there's nothing in the world
That could keep me from loving you
Well, I'm living when I'm loving
And I'm loving every time I'm with you
Just like walking in the sunshine
Lord, you make me feel so fine
And as long as we're leaving
And loving the way we want to
I know I'm gonna be
The best loved woman alive
I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got
I couldn't care less if they like it or not
As long as you're satisfied
With the things I do
I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got
In a hundred million years, I'll never stop
'Cause there's nothing in the world
That could keep me from loving you
Thrills I feel, I know are real
When you touch me
And I wake up every morning
With your arms wrapped around me tight
And the feeling I feel
Is exactly the way it should be
'Cause the love we've got
Keeps growing every day and night
I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got
I couldn't care less if they like it or not
As long as you're satisfied
With the things I do
I'm gonna hold on to the love I've got
In a hundred million years, I'll never stop
'Cause there's nothing in the world
That could keep me from loving you
No, there's nothing in the world
That could keep me from loving youWhat'll I do when you
Are far away
And I'm so blue,
What'll I do?
What'll I do when I
Am wondering who
Is kissing you,
What'll I do?
What'll I do with just
A photograph
To tell my troubles to?
When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
That won't come true,
What'll I do?
What'll I do with just
A photograph
To tell my troubles to?
When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
That won't come true,
What'll I do?If I was on some foggy mountain top
I'd sail away to the west
I'd sail all around this whole wide world
To the girl, I love the best
If I had listened to what Mama said
I would not have been here today
A lyin' around this old jailhouse
Just weepin' my sweet life away
If I was on some foggy mountain top
I'd sail away to the west
I'd sail all around this whole wide world
To the girl, I love the best
She caused me to weep, she caused me to mourn
She caused me to leave my home
Oh, those lonesome pines and those good ol' times
I'm on my way back homeLay back, lay back, go to sleep my man
Wipe the blood from you face and your hands
Forgive yourself if you think that you can
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man
Twenty-one days lost at sea I fought
For twenty-two years non-stop I've talked
Through the desert, pissed drunk, and confused I walked
I spit a tooth in the palm of my hand
Lay back, lay back, go to sleep my man
Wipe the blood from you face and your hands
Forgive yourself if you think that you can
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man
Well the wind and the trees are ganging up on me
They sing my funeral song in harmony
Well I just want to walk home on the drunk I need
But they keep singing and singing and singing to me
La, La, La, La, La, La (I hear them singing)
La, La, La, La, La, La (Singing for me)
La, La, La, La, La, La (Oh!)
Well I wish things were different, true, and deep
But everything that's so shallow is everything about me
If only I could just take all my money and leave
I hope the people on the ground will understand
I hope the people out there will understand
Lay back, lay back, go to sleep my man
Wipe the blood from you face and your hands
Forgive yourself if you think that you can
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man
La, La
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man
La, La
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man(There's anything shared at our house tonight since God called my daddy away)
Tonight my heart is heavy there's not a tear left in my eyes
You see my dad just passed away and I've told him so many lies
There were fifteen of us in our family and not a dime did we see
So all alone there in the graveyard I had to dig my daddy's grave
As I dug my conscience hurt me and as I rise my shovel high
It seemed my entire life was quickly flashing by
I thought of how he'd beat me and I tried to make him mad
And I knew every lickin' he gave me hurt him twice as bad
I thought of how he'd leave us when our lunch was an empty sack
But I knew dad worked hard and for us kids he'd break his back
Then I thought of how we'd hurt him why I'd take his core anytime
Maybe I'd have a wreck and land in jail he'd be there to bail me out everytime
I'd stand up in the space and curse him then I'd I leave so I wouldn't see him cry
Then he'd fall on his knees and say dear God give my son another try
After the funeral was over and the coffin was laid in its place
They handed me the shovel and asked me to throw more dirt in his face
I wish I showed him how much I love him I could have had a try
But I do have one consolation he knew God before he diedI'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't by the same dear if you're not here with me
And when those blue snowflakes start falling (blue, blue)
That's when those blue memories start calling (blue, blue)
You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
(Blue, blue) think I'm felling better already (blue, blue)
You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue ChristmasLord knows, I need to hear the things,
You're whisperin' in my ear.
Even though I know that they're not true.
It's as warm as weakness,
Wantin' arms to hold her near.
But you already have someone who gives all her love to you.
You should be layin' in her arms,
Instead of lyin' here in mine.
You should be tellin' her the things you're tellin' me:
Like how much you need me,
An' always want me near,
Oh, it's such a lovely line.
You should be layin' in her arms,
Instead of lyin' here in mine.
Sure, I can feel the fire,
An' the wanting when we touch.
An' layin' down would sure be good with you.
You know all the words that make,
A woman feel so much.
Oh, it would be so easy but it's not the thing to do.
You should be layin' in her arms,
Instead of lyin' here in mine.
You should be tellin' her the things you're tellin' me:
Like how much you need me,
An' always want me near,
Oh, it's such a lovely line.
You should be layin' in her arms,
Instead of lyin' here in mine.Yeah, yeah
What you got if you ain't got love
The kind that you just want to give away
It's okay to open up
Go ahead and let the light shine through
I know it's hard on a rainy day
You wanna shut the world out and just be left alone
But don't run out on your faith
'Cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand
And what you've been out there searching for forever
Is in your hands
And when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else seem so small
It's so easy to get lost inside
A problem that seems so big at the time
It's like a river that's so wide it swallows you whole
While you're sitting around thinking about what you can't change
And worrying about all the wrong things
Time's flying by, moving so fast
You better make it count 'cause you can't get it back
Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand
And what you've been out there searching for forever
Is in your hands
Oh, and when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else seem
So small, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand
And what you've been out there searching for forever
Is in your hands
And then you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Oh, it sure makes everything else seem
So small
Yeah, yeahI think I'll take my foolish heart, my friend, and head right for the door.
There'll be a better world waitin' if I do.
'Cause I know I've been down this road a time or two before,
The only time I let my heart turn to you.
Now, I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true.
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door.
Still somethin' deep inside keeps tellin' me to make the sacrifice,
And askin' me to walk the extra mile.
I've walked it now to many times with freedom for the price.
Too many times to fight back tears behind my smiles.
Now, I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true.
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door.
I know I must seem quite unkind to wander off tonight
And leave the moon up above to hold your gaze.
It's only that my foolish heart is bound with foolish pride.
Maybe some day I'll see the sunshine upon your face.
Now I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true.
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door.
I'll take my heart, and head right for the doorOpen up your eyes
Cause there's a shadow outside
Open up your eyes
Cause there's something outside
Wake up the drowsy friends
You've made along your way
Because there's shadows
On the horizon my friend
There's shadows on the horizon
Take this amulet
Take this and go
And be on your way
That's all i got to say
You're lucky you've come this far at all
You're near the end of your days
Because there's shadows
On the horizon my friend
There's shadows on the horizonWell now cowboys love the ladies they like beans and sour dough
Good horses and hot black coffee and camp fires burnin' low
You know we love that cowboy music but I'll bet you didn't know
That even cowboys like just a little rock and roll
Even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll
Yeah we all got some boogie woogie in our soul
There's a little bit of Buddy Holly in every cowboy that I know
And even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll
Now when you're camped out on the prairie and that ole moon is shinin' bright
And you can hear them cattle bawlin' soft and low
There's nothin' like a cowboy song to make it all feel just right
But even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll
Even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll
Yeah we all got some boogie woogie in our soul
There's a little bit of Chuck Berry in every cowboy that I know
And even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll
Now those old buckaroos are set in their ways and they'll even tell you so
Say they don't like nothin' but them old time cowboy songs
Yeah but I've seen that green grass growin' underneath that winter snow
I'll bet them old cowboys even like a little rock and roll
Even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll
Yeah we all got some boogie woogie in our soul
There's a little bit of Charlie Daniels in every cowboy that I know
And even cowboys like a little bit of rock and rollWell, I've been out all night just sneakin' around
My feet start itchin' when the sun goes down
Time to come clean, you got the goods on me
But I ain't no angel, and it's plain to see
That I love you more than anything in this whole world
And when it comes to you, you know that I'm your girl
So let me make it up to you, all night long
Hey, I wasn't doing nothin' honey you ain't done before
But I was hip-mo-tized by the swinging doors
I love to party and I love to dance
A little wink and a smile don't mean romance
Maybe I been naughty, now I wanta be nice
You need some warmin' up 'cause you're as cold as ice
So let me make it up to you, all night long
[Chorus]
Let me make it up to you
I want to wake up with you
I promise that I'll be true blue
Let me make it up to you
I want to stay up with you
All night long, all night long
[Chorus]
Well, I love you more than anything in this whole world
And when it comes to you, you know that I'm your girl
So let me make it up to you, all night long
Let me make it up to you, all night long
All night long, all night long
All night long, all night long
All night long, all night long
All night long, all night longI wanna dance by water 'neath the Mexican sky
Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight
Are you with me, are you with me?
I wanna fall like the Carolina rain on your skin
I wanna walk a little too far out on that limb
Take you every place I've been and never been
Are you with me, are you with me?
We can chase the wild dreams, live like crazy
Love me baby, come on, come on, come on
Just throw your arms around me
We can run like we won't run out of time
I wanna fly so high that I'll never come down
I wanna love so hard, it could rip my heart out
I wanna get so lost that I'll never be found
Are you with me? Are you with me?
We can chase the wild dreams, live like crazy
Love me baby, come on, come on, come on
Just throw your arms around me
We can run like we won't run out of time
Are you with me?
We can chase the wild dreams, live like crazy
Love me baby, come on, come on, come on
Just throw your arms around me
We can run like we won't run out of time
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Come on, come on, come on
Just come with meShutters and boards cover the windows of the house where we used to live
All I have left is a heart full of sorrow since she said she'd never forgive
The house that we've built was once filled with laughter
But I changed that laughter to tears
Now I live in a world without sunshine oh I wish you were here
Shutters and boards...
Last night I dreamed that you came to our house to take an old book from the shelf
If you'll open the shutters I'll tear down the boards
'Cause I drove every nail by myself
Shutters and boards...
(One more time) Shutters and boards...G D C
You're the devil's daughter in disguise
G D C
So don't try to hide the fire in your eyes
D C G
You must be stupid cause you just don't have a clue
D C D
Even hell frozen over is warmer than my love for you
Chorus:
G D C
When all those Aggies move to Austin
G D C
And Beaumont is covered in snow
G D C
When the wind don't blow in Amarillo
C D G
Darlin' then you can come back home
G D C
You sure can shake your little round behind
G D C
But your hour glass figure won't buy my time
D C G
You know how to work it Lord knows it's worked before
D C D
This time you leave your butt will have the imprint of the front door
Chorus:
Bridge:

When Fort Worth is east of Dallas

And Texans forget the Alamo
C D G Em
When Lubbock opens up a ski resort

And the Brazos is straighter than an arrow
Chorus:

When all those Aggies move to Austin

And Beaumont is covered in snow
G D C
When the wind don't blow in Amarillo
C D G
Darlin' then you can come back home
Em
But don't hold your breath
C D G
then you can come back homeI can't work late although I need the money
Gotta get home to my loving honey
She'll be there waiting, waiting impatiently
Love is on a roll, love is on a good roll
Usually I meet with the boys of Friday
Only this morning she said this is my day
The look she gave me sent a shiver down into my soul
Love is on a roll, love is on a good roll
Our love is on a roll, our love is on a good roll
I'm a songwriter a professional dreamer
Mostly a singer but sometimes a screamer
I should know if anybody knows at all
When love is on a roll, love is on a good roll
So I gotta go, I gotta get home early
Be with my woman, soft and curvy
Makes me feel like a king and not a regular Joe
Love is on a roll, love is on a good roll
Love is on a roll, love is on a good roll
Our love is on a roll, our love is on a good roll
Our love is on a roll, our love is on a good roll
Our love is on a roll, our love is on a good roll
Our love is on a roll, our love is on a good roll
Love is on a roll, love is on a good roll
Love is on a roll, love is on a good rollI know there is no honor for ones like her and me
But should there ever be a place for broken hearts to weep
And should there be a kingdom for those who break the rules
They'll crown her queen unfaithful and me the king of fools
Queen unfaithful and king of fools
That's what they'll call us in that place the devil rules
I put all my faith in her and she broke all the rules
They'll crown her queen unfaithful and me the king of fools
[ piano ]
I know there are no prizes for the biggest lie
And there's no wealth or fame for those who's heart is taught to cry
But should there be a kingdom with a castle for two
They'll crown her queen unfaithful and me the king of fools
Queen unfaithful...Fast asleep in the dawn of ages
The soul of every child
Has waited to be born a stranger
Underneath the drum of his mothers heart
Lying deep in a dream of darkness
Where fear has never gone
Each spark of a life is started
Blind and pure to the world we come
Blind and pure to the world we come
Each of us a dancer to the drum
Each of us a dancer to the drum
Blind and pure we come
One is born into a life of hunger
One will be a king or a rich man's son
One will kill out of greed or anger
One will give his life for another one
There are smiles in the lies of innocence
There are blooms in the walls of stone
And we will see ourselves
In the eyes of everyone we have ever known
Everyone we have ever known
And the heart, the heart will ever be a witness
And precious time, no treasure is worth
And the child, the child will carry our existence
Through the days that we have on earth
Each of us a dancer to the drum
Each of us a dancer to the drum
Blind and pure we come
Fast asleep in the dawn of ages
The soul of every child
Has waited to be born a stranger
Underneath the drum of his mothers heartStanding at the back door
She tried to make it fast
One tear hit the hard wood
It fell like broken glass
She said sometimes love slips away
And you just can't get it back
Let's face it
For one split second
She almost turned around
But that would be like pouring rain drops
Back into a cloud
So she took another step and said
I see the way out, and I'm gonna take it
I don't wanna spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Another glass of whiskey but it still don't kill the pain
So he stumbles to the sink and pours it down the drain
He said it's time to be a man and stop living for yesterday
Gotta face it
'Cause I don't wanna spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Oh, I don't wanna keep on wishing, missing
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spending no more time
Wasted
She kept drivin' along
Till the moon and the sun were floating side-by-side
He looked in the mirror and his eyes were clear
For the first time in a while, hey, yeah
Oh, I don't wanna spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Oh, I don't wanna keep on wishing, missing
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spending no more time
Wasted
Oh, I don't wanna spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted, yeah, yeah
Oh, I don't wanna keep on wishing, missing
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spending no more time
WastedHere comes the first good snow
Only to decorate a vacant yard
Moving out of here tonight
All that's left to do is sweep the floor
Old address book in my hand
How'd I lose my place again
The only thing not packed away
Moving on a holiday
Just another place left clean
Won't be dreaming here anymore
Empty shelves and lonely keys
Sounds so hollow when I shut the door
Driving slowly, quiet streets
Signals even red and green
Me and what's not thrown away
Moving on a holidayTake Me As I Am (Or Let Me Go)
Written by Boudleaux Bryant
Gene Watson
Why do you always try to make me over
Take me as i am or let me go
White lilies never grow in fields of clover
Take me as i am or let me go.
You're tryin' to reshape me in a mold love
In the image of someone you used to know
I won't be a-standin' for an old love
So take me as i am or let me go.
You're tryin' to reshape me in a mold love
In the image of someone you used to know
I won't be a-standin' for an old love
Take me as i am or let me go.
Ho Just take me as i am or let me go.Where have you been,
My long lost friend?
It's good to see you again.
Come and sit for a while
I've missed your smile
Today the past is goodbye.
Time can't erase
A lover's embrace.
Can't you hear it calling?
A new day dawning
You were longing to find.
Love's taken you far
Away from my heart,
And I've been here all alone.
Have your eyes failed to find
What took you from mine,
A vision that's faded through time?
But you sailed away,
A fine summer's day,
Cause you heard it calling,
A new day dawning,
You were longing to find.
There is a way to make you stay.
Darlin' don't turn away
Don't doubt your heart
and keep us apart
I'm right where you are
Stay
There is a way to make you stay.
Darlin' don't turn away.
Don't doubt your heart
and keep us apart
I'm right where you are
StayYou could have had me for a song
Cus' my love was so strong
Though the years have come and gone
I leave a light on for you
I remember the day
That you went away
And I missed my chance to say
That I leave a light on for you
And how I wish that I had known
How quickly life moves on
And how I wish I'd been brave
Enough to try and make you stay
Little so long ago
But I still love you so
And I thought that you should know
That I leave a light on for you
We were too young and free
To think things would ever change
Now it's easy to see
How tear from tear all might have been
You could have had me for a song
Cus' my love was so strong
Though the years have come and gone
I leave a light on for youThey say that too much water has run under the bridge
That we never can live down the past
That once your love has ended it never can return
That's not so for we both know that our love will last
High as the mountains deep as the sea strong as the tallest tallest tree
That's how much I love you that's how much you love me
High as the mountains deep as the sea
Well it might be they're just jealous and don't want to understand
That our love will pass the test with room to spare
But it's just their conscience talking of their broken dreams and plans
For it shows and we both know that our love will last
High as the mountains
High as the mountains deep as the seaI like you better, ohh
I like you better, ohh
Those hands gets the best of me, ohh
I like crawlin' down on me
I wanted to hold you
Forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever
And I wait as you hold it
Goddamn, gotta roll with it, gotta roll with it
And the ride gets ov-over
Where are you goin'?
[Incomprehensible]
I can't think no more, I can't think
I can't use my brain, I can't think no more
I can't think no more, I can't think
I can't use my brain
I like you better, ahh
I like you better, whoa
Those hands gets the best of me
Your leg crawlin' down on me, ohh
And I wanted to hold you
Forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever
And I wait as you hold it
Goddamn, gotta roll with it, roll with it
And the ride gets over
But where are you goin'?
[Incomprehensible]
I can't think no more, I can't think
I can't use my brain, I can't think no more
I can't think no more, I can't think
I can't use my brain
I can't think no more, I can't think
I can't use my brain
I can't think no more, I can't think
I can't use my brain
I like you better, ohh
I like you better, ohh
I like you better, ohhCorrine Corrina, where you been so long?
Corrine Corrina, where you been so long?
Ain't been no lovin' since you been gone
I love Corrina, tell the world I do
I love Corrina, tell the world I doMaybe I took for granted
You'd be around
To pick me up on my way down
I thought my feet were planted
Firmly on the ground
'Til one day my whole world came unwound
And like a ball of yarn
Kept neatly on a spool
You held the life together
Of this broken hearted fool
And what once was the exception
Now seems to be the rule
And there's a burnin' question
A fire in my mind
You always had the answers
The ones I couldn't find
So all I'm askin'
Is where are you now?
What Father Time would sell me
I'd take it all
If only you'd come back around
But then if time should spell me
Well I might take the call
But there's no way of knowin' where I'm bound
So here comes another
Fine mess I've got into
And if I knew which way to turn
I'd still turn to you
So if everything is said and done
What am I supposed to do?
And that's the burnin' question
On fire in my mind
You always had the answers for me
Time after time
So all I'm askin'
Is where are you now?
All I'm askin'
Is where are you now?Laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key
Gentle roar of the wave on the shore
Makes its way through the crack neath the door
Wake up call from the ocean floor down in Avid Cove
Were laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key
Tequila Sunrise with a coconut base, hammock swingin in the palm tree shade
Standard Island beach Resort cliche, hey, but thats okay
Were laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key
Wind blowin on the back of my neck, sun reflectin off that tan on your breast
Found that feelin that we lost long ago down in Avid Cove
Were laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key
Were laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low KeyWith great anticipation he waited at the door
His only son was due from overseas
For months now he'd been waitin' since he'd gone off to war
And his eyes were filled with tears of great relief
Welcome home, son
His loving arms held open and his heart so full of love
Welcome home, son
I've been prayin' and been hopin' and I never did give up
I knew that you'd return to me
The place where you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long.
I hear him say as they embrace
"I've waited so long for this day
My son, my very own... Welcome home."
But a dreary rain was falling while another soldier fell
And a mother wakes up crying in the night
She thought she'd heard him calling in that moment she could tell
Her only son had passed into the light
Welcome home, son
His loving arems held open and his heart so full of love
Welcome home, son
As Jesus stood there glowing, their hands reached out and touched
I knew that you'd return to me
The place that you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long
As they embraced I heard him say
"I've waited so long for this day
My son, my very own... Welcome home."
Now I think of all the families that have lost a darling one
And I think how Jesus died for all our sins
And I think how much God loved us to send his only son
To live and die, and then to live again
Welcome home son
I hear God saying when they nailed Christ to the cross that day
Welcome home son
And when he sent his angels to roll that stone away
I knew that you'd return to me
The place where you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long
I hear God say as they embrace
"I've waited so long for this day
Well done my faithful son... Welcome home."
Welcome home!
I hope to hear God saying when it's my time to go!
Welcome home!
While the angel band is playing and God comes to claim my soul!
The angels will be singing and joybells will be ringing!
Rejoicing! I'll shout and sing along!
When there are no more wars to fight
And we're all children of the light
When the father and the son say
"Welcome home!"
Tag: Welcome home, welcome home, welcome home.I got up and made my mornin' cup of coffee
Fooled around the house an hour or more I guess
I did all this before I even had one thought of you
More and more I think about you less and less
I'm surprised but after all it's been a while now
Since I lost your love and all my happiness
But look as though I just might maybe learn to smile again
More and more I think about you less and less
I wouldn't be surprised if any day these teardrops I've been crying
All these heartaches you caused me begin to wither and then dying
Just now someone ask me if I'm hearing from you and I felt a lot like cryin' I confess
But I didn't cry I guess the worst is over now
More and more I think about you less and less
More and more I think about you less and lessLook at the sky, baby
What do you see?
Looks like the tears that I cry
Fallin' down like rain on the ground
Every time you say goodbye
Take a look around now
Why don't you feel
The way that cold wind stings and bites
And your words just are like arrows through my heart
Every time you say goodbye
There's a restless feeling knocking at my door today
There's a shadow hanging 'round my garden gate
I read between the lines of words you can't disguise
Love has gone away, and put these tears in my eyes
Look at the sky, baby, see how it cries?
Ain't it just like my tears
Fallin' down like rain on the ground
Every time you say goodbye
There's a restless feeling knocking at my door today
There's a shadow hanging 'round my garden gate
I read between the lines of words you can't disguise
Love has gone away, and put these tears in my eyes
There's a restless feeling knocking at my door today
There's a shadow hanging 'round my garden gate
I read between the lines of words you can't disguise
Love has gone away, and put these tears in my eyesHow pale is the sky that brings forth the rain
As the changing of seasons prepares me again
For the long bitter nights and the wild winter's day
My heart has grown cold, my love stored away
My heart has grown cold, my love stored away
I've been to the mountain, left my tracks in the snow
Where souls have been lost and the walking wounded go
I've taken the pain no girl should endure
Faith can move mountains; of that I am sure
But faith can move mountains; of that I am sure
Just get me through December
A promise I'll remember
Get me through December
So I can start again
No divine purpose brings freedom from sin
And peace is a gift that must come from within
I've looked for the love that will bring me to rest
Feeding this hunger beating strong in my chest
Feeding this hunger beating strong in my chestPour me another strong one, my baby just walked in the door
Tearing out my heart with her new love as she waltzes across that floor
Pour me another quick one I can't take this misery
Lucky him, lovely her, Pour me
Pour me another sad one, I'm swallowing my pity
Cause tonight she looks so pretty, satisfied
Pour me a shot of courage, I'm gonna ask him to his face
How it feels to steal my woman from my side
Pour me another double cause I'm single once again
Pour me and leave my bottle cause I'm losing my only friend
Bartender keep on pouring til I'm blind til I can't see
Lucky him, lovely her, Pour me
Pour me another double cause I'm single once again
Pour me and leave my bottle cause I'm losing my only friend
Bartender keep on pouring til I'm blind til I can't see
Lucky him, lovely her, Pour me
I used to dance with my darling now I'm just her used to be
Lucky him, lovely her, Pour me
Pour me another strong oneCan't you tell my love's a growin' can't you feel ain't it showin'
Though you must be a knowin' I got a big big love
It's not the kind to be concealin' just the kind to be revealin'
It's not a little bitty feelin' I got a big big love
I think it's time we done some walkin' I think it's time we done some talkin'
There's a great big moon above we got a big big love
This is not infatuation this is a true love sensational
It's not my imagination I got a big big love for you
[ steel ]
Can't you tell my love's a growin'...Somewhere just over the rainbow
lie answers to all our dreams
but the road we must follow to reach them
is paved with much anguish and grief
There's heartache around every corner
it lurks like a thief in the night
hiding silently deep in the shadows
making victims of those passing by
On this highway of dreams that we travel
there's no exit for easy street
it's rough and it's rocky and weathered by tears
and it's been no exception for me
but i know it's the right road i've taken
cause it's lead me somehow to your heart
and i may never have fallen for you
if i hadn't reached for the stars
in the curves we meet pain and rejection
at times it's so hard to be strong
but just when i think about turning around
you give me strength to go onSend a message to my heart
On the wings of the wind
Let me hear your sweet voice sayin'
You love me again
Even though we're apart
I hold to your memory
Send a message to my heart
To keep you here with me
Darlin' when you're all alone
Tell me do you think of me
Does my name touch your lips
Am I still in your dreams
Do your arms reach out for mine
In the still of the night
Do you wish that I was with you
When you turn out the lights
Send a message to my heart
On the wings of the wind
Let me hear your sweet voice sayin'
You love me again
Even though we're apart
I hold to your memory
Send a message to my heart
To keep you here with me
All these moments alone
Make me realize
Just how empty this old world is
Without you in my life
Our day is yet to come
And our love is so sweet
Send a message to my heart
To keep you here with me
Send a message to my heart
On the wings of the wind
Let me hear your sweet voice sayin'
You love me again
Even though we're apart
I hold to your memory
Send a message to my heart
To keep you here with me
Send a message to my heart
To keep you here with meShe was waitin' tables in a diner off of Highway 41
On his way to Indiana on another midnight run
So they talked about the weather and the next thing that you know
The hours flew by like minutes and it was time he had to go
On a rainy highway half way out of town
A voice inside his heart said turn those 18 wheels around
And go back
You've got somebody waitin'
Go back
That's where you need to be
Right now
There's nothing in this world more important than that
So go back
They settled down in a little house in the spring of '92
And she quit her job at the diner with the baby almost due
Those early years weren't easy and they had bills to pay
So he said you know I hate to leave you but I'll be back by Saturday
10 miles out of Tulsa his boss came on his radio
Said if you want to see your brand new daughter you better drop that load
And go back
You've got somebody waitin'
Go back
That's where you need to be
Right now
There's nothing in this world more important than that
So go back
Everybody heard the sirens
They pulled his rig out of the snow
In a rush to see his family somehow he lost control
Though the doctors tried to save him, he slipped into the light
Then he heard the angels whisper, now is not your time
Go back
You've got somebody waitin'
Go back
That's where you need to be
Right now
There's nothing in this world more important than that
So go back
(You've got somebody waitin')
Go back
(That's where you need to be)
Go back
(Go back)
Go backOh you took your sweet love from me oh you left me sweet sweet memories
And I cry I cry like a little baby cause there's still a lot of you left in me
Oh there's still a lot of you left in me and I cry cause your love'll set me free
Your love'll set me free
I'll keep holding on to love that used to be cause there's still a lot of you left in me
Oh I still go on to all our favorite places and I still see all our friends we used to see
Oh but I'm thinkin' now I'm just not the same without you
And that there's still a lot of you left in me
Oh there's still a lot of you...
Cause there's still a lot of you left in meI've lived a lot in my time
I once had a mansion and lived in my glory but now I'm down to my last dime
I once had a sweetheart but I was unfaithful yes I've lived a lot in my time
I fought the Grim Reaper down in the dark valley
I prayed when the sun wouldn't shine
I've looked through the bars of a cold lonely prison oh I've lived a lot in my time
I've been a soldier and I've been a rambler I once thought that everything was fine
I've hoed in the cornfield I've picked in the cotton yes I've lived a lot in my time
I've walked with our Master down in the dark valley and wonderful peace I did find
But now some day I'll journey to Eden's green pastures
Oh I've lived a lot in my time I've lived a lot in my timeMany years I've been lookin' for a place to call home
But I still didn't find it so I must travel on
I don't care for the fine mansions on earth's sinkin sand
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland
Lord build me just a cabin in the corner of gloryland
In the shade of his tree of life that it may ever stand
Where I can hear the angels sing and shake Jesus' hand
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland
Listen Lord I'm not askin' to live in the midst
For I know that I'm not worthy of such splendor as this
When I ask Him for mercy while humbly I stand
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland
I've many dear loved one's who've gone on this way
On the grapevine of mournin' shall I hear them all say
Come and join in the singin' and play in our band
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland(Neil Young)
Ain't it hard when you wake up in the morning
And you find out that those other days are gone?
All you have is memories of happiness
Lingerin' on.
You might wonder who can I turn to
On this cold and chilly night of gloom
The answer to that question
Is nowhere in this room.
All your dreams and your lovers won't protect you,
They're only passing through you in the end.
They'll leave you stripped of all that they can get to,
And wait for you to come back again.
You might wonder who I can turn to
On this cold and chilly night of gloom
The answer to that question
Is nowhere in this room.Been in the saddle
Since the sun came up
Roundin' up stray's in
This ole west Texas dust
She's been packin' her things
Since I put coffee on
By sundown she'll be gone
Damn this ole girth
Worn right in two
But a spare length of leather
And I'll make it do
Just when I think I've got
Life by the reins
Home ain't sweet home
On the range
[Chorus]
If heartaches were horses
And hard times were cattle
I'd ride home at sunset
Sittin' tall in the saddle
If heartaches were horses
And hard times were cattle
And she'd say she loved me
And this cowboy way of life
She'd be right beside me
When we rode home tonightThink of your fellow man, lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see, it's getting late, oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see
Another day goes by, and still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know, we won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see. Wait and seeThey say mother earth is breathing
With each wave that finds the shore
Her soul rises in the evening
For to open twilight's door
Her eyes are the stars in heaven
Watching o'er us all the while
And her heart it is in Ireland
Deep within the Emerald Isle
We are forty against hundreds
In someone else's bloody war
We know not why were fighting
Or what we're dying for
They will storm us in the morning
When the sunlight turns to sky
Death is waiting for its dance now
Fate has sentenced us to die
Ireland I am coming home
I can see your rolling fields of green
And fences made of stone
I am reaching out won't you take my hand
I'm coming home Ireland
Oh the captain he lay bleeding
I can hear him calling me
These men are yours now for the leading
Show them to their destiny
As I look up all around me
I see the ragged tired and torn
I tell them to make ready
'Cause we're not waiting for the morn
Ireland I am coming home
I can see your rolling fields of green
And fences made of stone
I am reaching out won't you take my hand
I'm coming home Ireland
Now the fog is deep and heavy
As we forge the dark and fear
We can hear their horses breathing
As in silence we draw near
There are no words to be spoken
Just a look to say good-bye I draw a breath and night is broken
As I scream our battle cry
Ireland I am coming home
I can see your rolling fields of green
And fences made of stone
I am reaching out won't you take my hand
I'm coming home Ireland
Yes I am home Ireland
We were forty against hundredsI walked across the bridge to the island
And sat down in the grass by the old homestead
I listened to the song of the cicadas
And thought about the one whose hair was red
This is where she gave birth to my father
Back when she was just a newly wed
You wouldn't know it looking at this picture
That her eyes were blue, hair was red
You wouldn't know she traveled far and wide
You wouldn't know she lived here all her life
There is so much you'll never know about her
So much left to say that's left unsaid
But I have got this picture in my memory
And her eyes are blue, her hair is redHow many years how many rollin' stones above
Liky a Gypsy I have roamed from place to place
Fortune never came to me how happy I would be
Just to look again upon your smiling face
Now if I should wander back tonight, would you be waiting?
Would your eyes be filled with love or tender lies?
Would you warm me into dear, would you thrill to find me near?
Would you love me if I wander back tonight?
Last night I dreamed that you and I were back together
I held your hand so gently in my own
Heard you say we'd never part as I pressed you to my heart
Then I walked in tears to find myself alone
Now if I should wander back tonight, would you be waiting?
Would your eyes be filled with love or tender lies?
Would you warm me into dear, would you thrill to find me near?
Would you love me if I wander back tonight?I was born in a hurry but there wasn't any place
Nowhere fast seemed better than nowhere slow
I never really got the hang of hanging around
When you get down to it
I guess I always knew it
What it is that makes my world go round
[Chorus]
It's a matter of horsepower
For 8 seconds on miles per hour
It's the way I am and it's a fact I can't ignore
Yea, big boy legged, fuel injected
Running wild, radar detected
Man can always stand a little bit more
Horsepower
Well the view looks better from ahead than it looks behind
I've got a need to speed and I don't mean the drugs-store kind
Some people like a life that barely moves at all
I say more power to them
Then I fly right through 'em
'Til it slows down to a crawl
[Chorus]
Then I think about horsepower
For 8 seconds on miles per hour
It's the way I am and it's a fact I can't ignore
Yea, big boy legged, fuel injected
Running wild, radar detected
Man can always stand a little bit more
HorsepowerI can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind
To live in memory
Of such an old lonesome time
I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday.
Those happy hours
That we once knew
Though long ago,
They still make me blue
They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apartIn the fury of the moment when the words of rath rang out
When my mind was filled with questions and my head was filled with doubt
I can still see all the sadness and the sorrow in your eyes
How can flowers live in darkness how can I apologize
For the blackness I've created in the world that used to shine
I've wilted all the roses and I've spoiled all the wine
Get out your magic pencil and erase the cloudy skies
Draw a picture of me saying I apologize
Give me back the words I spoke in haste
Give 'em back or love will go to waste give 'em back
[ ac.guitar ]
See the sunlight reappearing through the shrouds of darkened gloom
As I hear your words forgiving me and watch the flowers bloom
Have your arms refused to open have you served all your ties
I'd still be on my knees saying I apologize
Give me back the words I spoke in haste
Give 'em back or love will go to waste give 'em backPraise him praise him Jesus our blessed redeemer
Sing oh earth his wonderful love proclaim
Hail him hail him highest archangels in glory
Strength and honor give to his holy name
Like a shepherd Jesus will guard his children
In his arms he carries them all day long
Praise him praise him tell of his excellent greatness
Praise him praise him ever in joyful song
[ piano ]
Praise him praise him Jesus our blessed redeemer
For our sins he suffered and bled and died
He our rock our hope of eternal salvation
Hail him hail him Jesus the crucified
Sound his praises Jesus who bore our sorrows
Love unbounded wonderful deep and strong
Praise him praise him tell of his excellent greatness
Praise him praise him ever in joyful songFaded old blue wranglers dusty cowboy hat pair of scuffed up boots upon your feet
Can of pork n beans that you opened with your knife
It ain't much but its all you've got to eat
You think of what your daddy said if your money should run low
Just call I'll send your busfare to come home
But you're just to proud to take it and home won't be the same
Now you've had a taste of rodeo
You set out on the road to seek your boyhood dreams
To satisfy the hunger in your soul
You wouldn't turn back now even if you could you were born to follow rodeo
All your money's gone cept a twenty dollar bill
But that's your fees to enter old Cheyenne
And all that's in your favor is you and your try
And a deep knawing desperately to win
Ss you step out on the highway with your thumb up in the air
In your mind a promise has been made
If this way of life don't kill you or you don't starve to death
You swear you'll be the champion someday
You set out on the road...
Faded old blue wranglers dusty cowboy hat pair of scuffed up boots upon your feet
Can of pork n beans that you open with your knife
It ain't much but its all you've got to eat
You set out on the road...Sometimes I still think of you
Love that's gone by and the things I didn't do
Time heals hearts, so they all say
Passage of years slowly pulls the pain away
But there's still a little tenderness left in everything I do
It's what I learned from loving you
That's what I learned from loving you
Times have changed, I have changed, too
Even my eyes have turned a deeper shade of blue
Well, I guess it's all that crying they went through
It's what I learned from loving you
That's what I learned from loving you
Well, I had too much to learn to hold on to someone like you
And it took losing you to make me see
The man you needed to be
I don't cry, though we're apart
And someday soon someone else will need this heart
And the next time I'm gonna know when a love is true
It's what I learned from loving you
That's what I learned from loving you
That's what I learned from loving you
That's what I learned from loving youIt's another day after another night
Another sun I never thought Id see rise
High heel hopes and whiskey lies
Ohhh-hoo
Feels like a freight train is running right though my head
My little black dress smells like cigarettes
A Napkin with no name, just an address
Had me a good time... I guess
How am I gunna get my life together
as old as its gettin' it aint gettin' any better
I dont know where to start
I'm fallin' so far behind
Mama says I gotta start acting like a lady
Daddys just worried 'bout his baby
How am I supposed to straighten up and fly right
When I dont even remember what I did last night
Shelly said she saw me hanging on an astronaut... not
Lettin him lie though his teeth cause his smile was hot
Im sittin here suckin' down second thoughts
a little hair of the dog... i know this has got to stop
How am I gunna get my life together
as old as its gettin' it aint gettin' any better
I dont know where to start
I'm falling so far behind
Mama says I gotta start acting like a lady
Daddys just worried 'bout his baby
How am I supposed to straighten up and fly right
When I dont even remember what I did last night
OoOoOoh
How am I gunna get my life together
as old as its gettin' it aint gettin' any better
I dont know where to start
Im falling so far behind
Mama says I gotta start acting like a lady
Daddys just worried about his baby
How am I supposed to straighten up and fly right
When I dont even remember........ What I did last nightLove makes the world go around love makes the wolrd go around
Sometimes up (and sometimes down) but love makes the world go around
When it comes right down to it you just gotta go do it
'Cause love is a thing that just won't wait
Sometimes it can spite ye or just right up and bite ye
And sometimes go up right in your face
Love makes the world...
(The first time that you feel it your first thought is to steal it
And run under a rock somewhere and hide
But once that you've been smitten you can't keep it hidden
Or it just might teach you a polite)
Love makes the world...
Sometimes up and sometimes down but love makes the world go aroundI woke up the other night lyin' on the floor
Just because of what I said before
She said, "My name's Juliet, but Romeo you ain't"
That's another good reason not to drink
That's another good reason not to drink
When I'm sober, I'm almost a saint
If I keep goin' on like this, I'll end up like ol' Hank
That's another good reason not to drink
I can't go see my best friend, he said stay away
Just because of what I said on his wedding day
"You ought to call her Sherman, 'cause she looks just like a tank"
That's another good reason not to drink
That's another good reason not to drink
When I'm sober, I'm almost a saint
If I keep goin' on like this, I'll end up like ol' Hank
That's another good reason not to drink
I'm gonna sue the city about that police man
Last night as I left the bar, he stepped right on my hand
He, "Are you drunk or blind"; I said, "Let me think"
That's another good reason not to drink
That's another good reason not to drink
When I'm sober, I'm almost a saint
If I keep goin' on like this, I'll end up like ol' Hank
That's another good reason not to drink
That's another good reason not to drink
When I'm sober, I'm almost a saint
If I keep goin' on like this, I'll end up like ol' Hank
That's another good reason
Baby, let me in, I'm freezin'
Another good reason not to drinkIf when you give the best of your service telling the world that the Saviour has come
Be not dismayed when man don't believe you he'll understand and say well done
Refrain
Oh when I come to the end of my journey weary of life the battle is won
Caring the staff and the cross of redemption he'll understand and say well done
Misunderstood, the savior of sinners, hung on the cross he was God's only son
Oh hear Him call to His father in heaven, let not my will but Thine be done.
If when you've tried and failed in your trying, hands sore and scarred from the work you've begun
Take up your cross and come quickly to Jesus, He'll understand and say well done.(Daddy what if the sun stop shinin' what would happen then)
If the sun stopped shinin' you'd be so surprised
You'd stare at the heavens with wide open eyes
And the wind would carry your light to the skies
And the sun would start shinin' again
(Daddy what if the wind stopped blowin' what would happen then)
If the wind stopped blowin' then the land would be dry
And your boat wouldn't sail son and your kite wouldn't fly
And the grass would see your troubles and she'd tell the wind
And the wind would start blowin' again
(But daddy what if the grass stopped growin' what would happen then)
If the grass stopped growin' why you'd probably cry
And the ground would be watered by the tears from your eyes
And like your love for me the grass would grow so high
Yes the grass would start growin' again
(But daddy what if I stopped lovin' you what would happen then)
If you stopped lovin' me then the grass would stop growin'
The sun would stop shinin' and the wind would stop blowin'
So you see if you wanna keep this old world a goin'
You better start lovin' me again again you better start lovin' me again
You hear me Bobby you better start lovin' me again
You love me Bobby you better start lovin' me againGlory to His name oh holy holy
There's a city where the streets are paved in gold
A land where the milk and honey flow
And a mansion which for me sause my bible tells the story
I just hope my feet are clean enough to walk upon the golden streets of glory
Green meadows where the little children play no sorrow there just one long happy day
And none will litter there except the pure and the holy
I just hope my feet are clean enough to walk upon the golden streets of glory
And when I've reached my journey's end and if I'm worthy to go in
The golden streets of glory I walk on
And the golden streets of my new home will lead me up to the Master's throne
With the angel band I'll sing glory to His name oh holy holy
I just hope my feet are clean enough to walk upon the golden streets of glory
Hallelujah I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
[ guitar ]
And when I've reached my journey's end...C'tait une jeune fille

Refrain Ah oui, ah! fit l'enfant, tout-ci, tout-aTi ta ti ... Ti ta ti ...Nous sommes en train de moudre,Nous sommes en train de moudre (bis)You left me for the bright lights of the town
A country boy set out to see the world
Remember when those neon lights shine down
That big old moon shines on your Kentucky girl
I swear I love you by the moon above you
How bright is it shining in your world
Some morning when you wake up all alone
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl
Don't wait to bring great riches home to me
I need no diamond rings or fancy pearls
Just bring yourself, you're all I'll ever need
That's good enough for this blue Kentucky girl
I swear I love you by the moon above you
How bright is it shining in your world
Some morning when you wake up all alone
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girlWhat changed the look in his eyes?
What made the change in his heart?
What changed his mind about the love we had?
What's tearing us apart?
What's come over my baby?
He's not the same as before
What's come over my baby?
My baby don't love me anymore
Can it be his old love is back again
Or has he found someone new?
Can it be with time he's just grown tired of me?
What's our love come into?
What's come over my baby?
He's not the same as before
What's come over my baby?
My baby don't love me anymoreI didn't hear the engines of a jet-plane I didn't hear the whistle of a train
I didn't hear the taxi-driver knockin' on my door
I didn't hear her walkin' cross the floor
But my baby packed up my mind and then she left me
She knew when I woke up that I'd be lookin' for my mind
She knew she'd leave a crazy man behind
But my baby packed up my mind and then she left me
I never thought this big ole king size bed would find her gone
I never thought she'd leave here alone
I never saw the distance or the leavin' in her eyes
I never thought my babe would wave goodbye
But my baby packed up my mind
Yes my baby packed up my mind and then she left meAt the airport in Chicago Sunday night
A soldier and his pretty wife came by
She had brought him there to send him off to war
I heard him say now don't cry anymore
Unashamed they kissed each other there
He ran his fingers through her pretty hair
Once or twice she tried but could not speak
I saw the teardrops rolling down her cheeks
She said now don't you worry I'll be true
I'll hope and pray no harm will come to you
I thought to myself good Lord what a shame
It made me stop and wonder who's to blame
That airport looked so big and then so small
I couldn't hold a teardrop back at all
He turned and ran to catch his waiting plane
She stood there crying calling out his name
She watched his plane go up into the sky
She waited until it was out of sight
Then she smiled and I thought Lord
She's lost her mind
But she reached into her purse and got a dime
She was smiling as she dropped the money in
She was smiling as she let the number ring
And as I left I heard her say into the phone
I'll be over later lover boy he's goneI won't climb the highest mountain I won't swim the deep blue sea
I won't brave a raging river I'm no hero on TV
Well there are other ways to prove my love if you're not too choosy
I'd swim the deep blue swimming pool climb the highest barroom stool
Brave the raging waters of a hot tub or Jacuzzi
Honey I'd live for you that'd be a lot more fun
Work and give to you vacations in the sun
No I wouldn't die for love like the poets say they'd do
I love you so much honey I'd live for you
So put down that romance novel I'm no sheik upon a steed
It might make you think this working man isn't what you need
I won't cross the desert sands for you to prove my love is blazing
But I'd crawl on my hands and knees across a king size bed for these
Two lips of yours that always please me isn't love amazing
Honey I'd live for you...

I'd swim the deep blue swimming pool climb the highest barroom stool
Brave the raging waters of a hot tub or Jacuzzi
Honey I'd live for you...
No I wouldn't die for love like the poets say they'd do
I love you so much honey (honey honey) I'd live for youForget about it
I'm admittin' I was wrong
And I'll just take what's mine
And walk right out the door
Forget about it
I'll split and I'll be gone
And you'll have memories
You'll find hard to ignore
'Cause after all
I'll see you sometime maybe
When I can't recall
How you drove me crazy
Forget about it
When forever's over
I won't remember how much
I loved you anymore
Forget about it
Put me out of your head
Now that you're free and easy
Out there on the town
Forget about it
When you're lying in bed
Just wishing I was there to lay you down
'Cause after all
I'll see you sometime maybe
When you will recall
How I drove you crazier
Forget about those stars in your eyes
Laying by the fireside
Holding you tight
I can't remember when I felt so right
So just forget about it
Forget about it
When you see me on the street
Don't wink, don't wave
Don't try to tease me with your smile
Forget about it
If we chance to meet somewhere
Don't think it's 'cause I'm trying to reconcile
'Cause after all
I'll see you sometime maybe
When I can't recall how you drove me crazier
Forget about those stars in your eyes
Laying by the fireside
Holding you tight
I can't remember when I felt so right
So just forget about itwe met in memphis
in a small caffee downtown
she was in for business
i was just on my way out
she was looking lonely over there sipping on a coffee cup
me being the friendly kind i jus couldn't pass this up
so i made my way all over to the corner booth
in my sweetest voice i said "would you care if i joined you"
with a smile she said yes
it was love working in memphis, tennessee, it was meant to be
i could never have known that day she was 'bout to come my way
it was someone else's plan, i guess
i fell in love right there in memphis
we stayed by the river in some town's house hotel sleep
and we made love all night long till we drifted off to sleep
i woke up in paradise
she laying there by my side
with the sound of wedding bells ringing in my mind
so i asked that morning
as we layed there in the sheets
i can't imagine a sweeter sound than the way she answered me
with a smile she said yes
it was love working in memphis, tennessee, it was meant to be
i could never have known that day she was 'bout to come my way
it was someone else's plan, i guess
i fell in love right there in memphis
so i asked that morning
as we layed there in the sheets
i can't imagine a sweeter sound than the way she answered me
with a smile she said yes
it was love working in memphis,
with a smile she said yes
it was love working in memphis, tennessee, it was meant to be
i could never have known that day she was 'bout to come my way
it was someone else's plan, i guess
i fell in love right there in memphis
we fell in love right there in memphisIn between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart shaped locket
Staring at a family flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight
Mom and daddy just won't stop it
Fightin' at the drop of the faucet
Cuts through the walls catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire
Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through the tears
She's saying, she's praying.
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, just a bang bang
Rolling off your tongue (I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it, no pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Wish there was a white flag waving
Or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing
Like shoot'em up cowboys
Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the score card
And just turn off all the noise.
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, just a bang bang
Rolling off your tongue (I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it, no pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Oh I wish they didn't cut like a knife
I wish they didn't break you inside
I wish they didn't bang bang make you wanna run, yeah
Like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, just a bang bang
Rolling off your tongue (I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No shot from the trigger when you pull it, no pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Oh like little toy gunsI was the one
Who was undone till you picked me up
So, how did you fall so far from it all?
Thought you were my rock
So, why do you push me away?
I'm not gonna stand here and watch you go down
I love you too much, no, I won't let you drown
And it just comes with being the man that I am
So forgive me, forgive me for giving a damn
Listen to me, I can't compete with this trip you're on
And if you decide to take that ride, I won't come along
'Cause I know just where it leads
I'm not gonna stand here and watch you go down
I love you too much, no, I won't let you drown
And it just comes with being the man that I am
So forgive me, forgive me for giving a damn
I know you're scared and you just wanna run
'Cause I've been there
I know where you're coming from
I'm not gonna stand here and watch you go down
I love you too much, no, I won't let you drown
And it just comes with being the man that I am
So forgive me, forgive me for giving a damn
Forgive me for giving a damnI woke up this morning
The room felt empty and bare
As I turned to the closet
Your clothes were not there
I walked to the kichen
Found our little girl with a note
As I read it to myself
the tears began to flow and she said
Please daddy don't cry that way
I know mommy left us, but thats ok
Please daddy don't cry so hard
You don't know how it scares me
And I wish you would stop
Please daddy don't cry that way
'Cause I'm right here beside you
And I promised that I'll stay
I looked down at her
through tear stained eyes
It is though you were there in a tiny disguise
She clenches her pyjama
With that soft little hand
See all this that's happening
She can't quite understand but she says
Please daddy don't cry that way
I know mommy left us, but thats ok
Please daddy don't cry so hard
You don't know how it scares me
And I wish you would stop
Please daddy don't cry that way
'Cause I'm right here beside you
And I promised that I'll stay
Searching my heart
And trying to explain
But the words that come out
Are swollen with pain
She looks through my eyes
Right down to my soul
Sees all the hurt
That I can't control and she says
Please daddy don't cry that way
I know mommy left us, but that's ok
Please daddy don't cry so hard
You don't know how it scares me
And I wish you would stop
Please daddy don't cry that way
'Cause I'm right here beside you
And I promised that I'll stay
Please daddy don't cry that way
I'm right here beside you
And I promised that I'll stayMy dirty little secrets not a secret anymore
I cant even keep it from myself
Everybodys secret looks the same behind closed doors
If I had only known before I fell
Can you even recognize the better part of me?
Under cover in disguise where I want to be
Anywhere but me
My dirty little secret spills out on the kitchen floor
As you pour your second cup of tea
I cant clean it up the way I always did before
On the sly so no one else can see
Can you even recognize the better part of me?
In my lies and alibis where I want to be
Anywhere but me
If Im good enough for you, am I good enough for me?
Can you even recognize the heart inside my sleeve?
What is left for me to hide, whos left to believe?
Anyone but meI'm thinking of you again tonight
And I'm oh so far from home
I'm missing you again tonight
As I sit and dream alone
I'm needing you as I never did before
But somehow my plans went wrong
I'm wanting you again tonight
And I'm oh so far from home
From my tiny window I see couples on the street
So in love as they go strolling on
And tonight I see myself more in love with you
And I'm oh so far from home
And I'm oh so far from homeSoft as the voice of an angel
Breathing a lesson unheard
Hope with a gentle persuasion
Whispers a comforting word.
Wait, 'till the darkness is over
Wait, 'till the tempest is done
Hope, for the sunshine tomorrow
After the darkness is gone.
Whispering hope,
Oh how welcome Thy voice
Making my heart
In it's sorrow rejoice.
If in the dusk of the twilight
Dimmed be the region afar
Will not the deepening darkness
Brighten the glittering star.
Then when the night is upon us
Why should the heart sink away
When the dark midnight is over
Watch for the breaking of day.
Whispering hope,
Oh how welcome Thy voice
Making my heart
In it's sorrow rejoiceYou're the only star in my blue heaven
And you're shining just for me
You're the only star in my blue heaven
And in dreams your face I see
You're the guiding light that brightens up the night
Till you come in sight my heart is lonely
You're the only star in my blue heaven
And you're shining just for me
You're the only star in my blue heaven
And you're shining just for me
You're the guiding light that brightens up the night
Till you come in sight my heart is lonely
You're the only star in my blue heaven
And you're shining just for meI've been running low on inspiration
Tired of that physical intrigue
There's nothing left to imagination
Living in a world that treats love so carelessly
Don't want no smooth talkin' lover
I can't play the role
It just leaves me cold
I need a high powered love
I wanna feel that lightning streak
High powered love
Got to be down in the heart with me
Sometimes it's hard to keep believing
Too many pretty faces all skin deep
Is there anyone left with teeth just a little uneven
And won't spend more time with a mirror than me
If you're just looking for a good time
A notch on your gun
I ain't the one
I want a high powered love
Got to have intensity
High powered love
Don't start the fire if you can't take the heat
I can't turn back I'm on a mission
I know there's someone out there for me
I need a high powered love
One that'll defy gravity
High powered love
Got to be strong and keep on lifting me
Higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher
High powered love
High powered love
Higher, higher, higher(It is no secret what God can do)
The chimes of time ring out the news another day is through
Someone slipped and fell was that someone you
You may have long for added strength your courage to renew
Do not be this hearten for I bring hope to you

I'm tired of being the teardrops on your face
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
I know your every weakness
I can find one in everything you say
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm not the one that you really need
I'm not the one in your dreams
I can see it in your eyes
This ain't the way it should feel
I don't know how we got here
Love's no longer blind
If that's just how it is
Can we go on like this
Oh, baby what do you say
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
I'll set your heart free
And if you're mine
You'll come flying back some day
But I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
Well I'm taking you with me
Like a room in my heart
You will have your place
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm not the one that you really need
I'm not the one in your dreams
I can see it in your eyes
This ain't the way it should feel
I don't know how we got here
Love's no longer blind
If that's just how it is
Can we go on like this
Oh, baby what do you say
I'm tired of loving this way
I'm tired of loving this wayI pay rent on a run-down place
There ain't no view but there's lots of space
In my heart
The heart that you own
I pay the rent
Pay it right on time
Baby I pay you every single dime
For my heart
The heart that you own
Used to be I could love here for free
Way back before you bought the property
Now I pay daily on what once was mine
Lord I probably owe you
For the tears that I cry
'Cause I pay rent on a run-down place
There ain't no view but there's lots of space
In my heart
The heart that you own
I struggle each night to find a new way
To pay what I owe
Just so I can stay
I ain't overdue
So you can't throw me out
I've loved here for years
Don't know where I'd go now(Louis Driver)
Well she's my Rose from the mountain where I come from
Back in ol' Colorado where they reach up and touch the sun
But I took her to the city where the air ain't clean
And it's wilted my Rose from the mountain
(Chorus)
Where a good guitar picker makes more money than a cowboy
So I thought I'd try my luck makin' records in L.A.
But a lot of them bloys make a lot more music than I can
And if Rose don't like the city life I think I'll take her home
Well I can see her in the mornin' runnin' barefoot through the meadow
With a smile on her face and her hair a-hangin' long
Well I love my sweet Rosey and oh she loves me
So I'm takin' her back home to the mountain
(Chorus)
She's my Rose from the mountain where I come from
Back in ol' Colorado where they reach up and touch the sun
But I took her to the city where the air ain't clean
And it's wilted my Rose from the mountain
Yes it's wilted my Rose from the mountainOff he goes down the road
Who knows how many he's been down before
With all the years he's come to know
Does he wonder if he's gonna see one more
Hanging on to yesterdays
Till too many tomorrows are today
With all the turns the road will bring
Well, a young man's gotta wait and see
And will I ever be the old man
Whose words young ones ponder on?
Will I ever take a lady's hand?
And will I ever be the old man
Who finally is too far gone?
Will there come a day when I can't stand
Am I gonna live that long?
Reaching out for days to come
Where an old man walks, a young man runs
The road I know is bound to end
Still I can't help wondering where and when
And will I ever be the old man
Whose words young ones ponder on?
Will I ever take a lady's hand?
And will I ever be the old man
Who finally is too far gone?
Will there come a day when I can't stand
Tell me, am I gonna live that long?I hear you walking across the floor
I think that I'm dreaming
'Til I hear you shut the door
I wake up crying and calling your name
Nothing's changed here without you
I start every day the same
The same old sun comes up to shine
On this old bed at the same old time
I tell myself the same old lie
I've got you off my mind
I feel your body lyin' next to mine
I reach out in the darkness
But you're not there for me to find
There's only sorrow followed by pain
Nothing's changed here without you
I start every day the same
I see your sweet lips softly kiss me goodbye
I taste the salt of my teardrops
As they fall down from my eyes
I take a deep breath
But it's only in vain
'Cause nothing's changed here without you
I start every day the same
I start every day the sameWho can blame you, though your heart's untrue
When you say it's my fault anyway?
You turn your head from the tears I've shed
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you
You justify yourself in your love for someone else
When you say, I never loved you anyway
Your vows were made in vain, although my love still remains
Though you broke my heart in two, who can blame you
Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue
When you say it's my fault anyway?
You turn your head from the tears I've shed
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you
In a heart of rusty steel you kept your love affair concealed
'Til the day she was asking you to stay
You turned your head from the tears I've shed
Though you broke a heart in two, who can blame you
Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue
When you say it's my fault anyway?
You turn your head from the tears I've shed
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you
Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue
When you say it's my fault anyway?
You turn your head from the tears I've shed
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you
You turn your head from the tears I've shed
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame youThey say you never know what you got until it's gone
He's gonna learn the hard way, when he finds you long gone
Gone like the wind in your hair, hands in the air
Singing, so long, good luck
I wanna set your heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway
Heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway truck
1989 Cheyenne Chevrolet
5-Speed, single cab
Bench seat, faded grey
Turned over twice, ain't too nice
But it knows how to run
Girl, I'll get you out with a bang
Like a bullet from a gun
They say you never know what you got until it's gone
He's gonna learn the hard way, when he finds you long gone
Gone like the wind in your hair, hands in the air
Singing, so long, good luck
Girl, I wanna set your heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway
Heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway truck
Summertime sunshine, cheap sunglasses
My heart sang southern twang
Sweeter than molasses, like the
Country angel two stepping in my dance of dreams
Girl, you got a heart of gold
And you're beautiful in blue jeans
They say you never know what you got until it's gone
He's gonna learn the hard way, when he finds you long gone
Gone like the wind in your hair, hands in the air
Singing, so long, good luck
Girl, I wanna set your heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway
Heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway truck
They say life is like a highway
You can turn into a dead end road
I ain't afraid to get stuck
I got a 4-wheel drive kinda heart
I know is tough enough to carry any load
They say you never know what you got until it's gone
He's gonna learn the hard way, when he finds you long gone
Gone like the wind in your hair, hands in the air
Singing, so long, good luck
Good luck
They say you never know what you got until it's gone
He's gonna learn the hard way, when he finds you long gone
Gone like the wind in your hair, hands in the air
Singing, so long, good luck
Girl, I wanna set your heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway
Heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway
Heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway truck
I wanna be your getaway truckTo you I'm just the man who let you down,
The one who never gave you what you need,
It's true I wasn't always around,
Back when you were reaching out for me,
I know you think I didn't care,
You say I'm just the hurting kind,
And I know you think my heart wasn't there,
But I'm begging you to think it through one more time,
Cause you don't know a thing about me,
If you don't know how much I miss you,
And you don't know a thing about me,
Unless you know how much I need to be with you,
Well I see the mistakes I made,
The way I acted carelessly,
But if you don't know how much I need your forgiveness,
Then you don't know a thing about me,
If I could just go back and make it right,
And take the tears away you know I would,
I've come to you with no excuse tonight,
Just a prayer that I'll be understood,
You tell me that I'm never gonna change,
I'll always be the same old guy,
You think there's nothing left for us to say,
Before you write me off take a look in my eyes,
Cause you don't know a thing about me,
If you don't know how much I miss you,
And you don't know a thing about me,
Unless you know how much I need to be with you,
Well I see the mistakes I made,
The way I acted carelessly,
But if you don't know how much I need your forgiveness,
Then you don't know a thing about me,May each moment I live be yours love may the best I can give be yours love
And from this moment on may a love that is strong and lives on and on be yours love
May the sons that I raise be yours love may the comforts I praise be yours love
If I ever get weak may the love words I speak and the arms that I seek be yours love
May the Lord's shining grace be yours love may the happiest face be yours love
May the last fingertips that touch these two lips as life from me slips be yours loveDADDY'S LITTLE GIRL

Adalida, pretty little cajun queen
Sweet dixie flower, the belle of the bayou
You're every young man's dream
Adalida, I'd walk through a hurricane
To stand beside you sweet adalida
I'd swim the pontchartrain
Oh no, here you comin' down the road
With your cotton dress a swishin', you gettin' some attention
From all the boys in the thibodaux
Oh my your really feelin' up their eyes
Smilin' and a winkin', I know what they're thinkin'
But I'm the only one who loves you so!
Repeat chorusIf you need your car towed,
If that Volkswagen breaks down on the way out of this town
I know a guy
I'll make a few calls,
If you need something part time
'Til you're back on your feet
I know a guy
And if you're looking for someone barely hanging on,
Lost the only thing that he ever loved
Wishing you would come over
Give anything just to hold ya
If you're trying to find a man who lost his mind,
Doesn't sleep at night unless he's dreaming about you laying right here beside him
Praying someday you might feel like forgiving
And think about giving him one more try
Then I know a guy
If you would ask me to think of a person that didn't deserve you
I know a guy
And if you needed a man to never really listen
Not know what he'd be missing
I know a guy
If you're looking for someone barely hanging on,
Lost the only thing that he ever loved
Wishing you would come over
Give anything just to hold ya
If you're trying to find a man who lost his mind,
Doesn't sleep at night unless he's dreaming about you laying right here beside him
Praying someday you might feel like forgiving
And think about giving him one more try
Then I know a guy
Yeah I know a guy
Who feels like a fool,
He's been hating himself for what he put you through
He'd take it all back if he only knew how
He knows that you've probably moved on by now
But if you're looking for someone barely hanging on,
Lost the only thing that he ever loved
Wishing you would come over
Give anything just to hold ya
If you're trying to find a man who lost his mind,
Doesn't sleep at night unless he's dreaming about you laying right here beside him
Praying someday you might feel like forgiving
And think about giving him one more try
Then I know a guy
One, one more try
I know a guyIf you'd have only taken the time to tell me you're mine and say that you love me
I may not have been too eager then to tell you goodbye
But I made up my mind for sure this time that I'm gonna leave you
So next time don't wait don't hesitate appreciate the good man
I don't belong so I'll just move along it's better this way
A man should walk tall but you made me feel small and that's why I say
If you'd have only taken the time...
But I made up my mind...
But I made up my mind...(Dolly Parton)
I look at you and I see something special
I feel something special, something that's rare
If you feel the same way when you're lookin' at me
I know there could be a love we could share
Won't you come and love with me
Shelter your love in my castle of dreams
We'll find in each other the things that we need
Won't you come and love with me
We'll sing us a love song the songbirds would envy
A song that the angels would be proud to sing
We'll say with our hearts what no poet could capture
Say with our eyes what no artist could paint
Won't you come and love with me
Shelter your love in my castle of dreams
We'll find in each other the love that we need
Won't you come and love with meI'm calling from the station and I haven't got much time to let you know
Got a ticket for Missouri and there's things I need to say before I go
If I could I'd have you meet me but I don't see how I can
I don't have enough to pay your fare
There's a factory in Columbus hirin' now I understand
And they're looking for an able bodied man
Baby you should get some money in the letter that I mailed two days ago
But when I wrote the letter saying you could come to me I didn't know
That I was goin' to lose my job in such a little while
Now I guess we'll have to change our plan
They may not hire me in Columbus but I'm pretty sure they will
Cause they're looking for an able bodied man
If I had more education now I'd a' made a better life for me and you
But just simple manual labor is the only kind of work that I can do
The bus is loadin' for Missouri so I guess I'd better go(Dolly Parton)
It's Saturday night and it's a perfect night for dancin'
I've had my makeup off and on all day
But it's gotta be right for a night of sweet romancing
And I've combed my hair at least a thousand ways
Mirror Mirror don't you tell a soul
Of how I smiled and talked all day to you
And how I practiced every step I know of
But tonight's the night and I'm a dancing fool
(It's a sure thing) when the sun goes down this evenin'
(It's a sure thing) to be out on the dancing floor
(It's a sure thing) I'll be the last one leavin'
(It's a sure thing) gonna dance till I can't no more
I could of had a date but I thought I'd take my chances
I'm gonna dance with a different guy to every song
Then I'm a gonna wait till the right one strikes my fancy
The he's gonna be the one to dance me home
(It's a sure thing) when the sun goes down this evenin'
(It's a sure thing) to be out on the dancing floor
(It's a sure thing) I'll be the last one leavin'
(It's a sure thing) gonna dance till I can't no more
(It's a sure thing) when the sun goes down this evenin'
(It's a sure thing) to be out on the dancing floor
(It's a sure thing) I'll be the last one leavin'
(It's a sure thing) gonna dance till I can't no moreHey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
Though I know that evenings empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship
My senses have been stripped
May hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone
It's just escaping on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time
It's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
Take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time
Far past the frozen leaves
The haunted frightened trees
Out to the windy bench
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky
With one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea
Circled by the circus sands
With all memory of fate
Driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following youCause your love takes good care of me yes your love takes good care of me
And when the rain falls and the wind blows and the storm is on the sea
I'll be safe your love takes care of me
When life for me gets weary and the sun refuses to shine
I run to the arms of the one I love and there I hide
You know just what to do and say you make my life worthwhile
And when I look into your face I see heaven in your smile
And your love takes...
I'll be safe your love takes care of meI wandered so aimless
Life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear Savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy
No sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light
Just like a blind man
I wandered along worries and fears
I claimed for my own
Then like a blind man
That God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light...
I was a fool to wander and stray
For straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light...
Praise the Lord I saw the lightMirror mirror on the wall who's the saddest of them all
But I don't have to see I know it's gotta be me
Every time the wind blows at my window I rush to see if it's you at my door
And the sadness fill the rooms when you're not standin' there
And I wish that I could walk right through the floor
Mirror mirror on the wall...
[ steel ]
Every night in dreams you torment me as I remember things I should forget
And the sun comes up by and a new day's dawnin'
But nothing's changed for I still love you yet
Mirror mirror on the wall...Well I sold the farm to take my woman where she longed to be
We left our kin and all our friends back there in Tennessee
And I bought those one way tickets she had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore
Well her heart was filled with gladness when she saw those city lights
She said the prettiest place on earth was Baltimore at night
Well a man feels proud to give his woman what she's longing for
And I kind of like the streets of Baltimore
Then I got myself a factory job, I ran an old machine
And I bought a little cottage in a neighborhood serene
And every night when I'd come home with every muscle sore
She'd drag me through the streets of Baltimore
Well I did my best to bring her back to what she used to be
Then I soon learned she loved those bright lights more than she loved me
Now I'm a going back on that same train that brought me here before
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
While my baby walks the streets of BaltimoreI can't have this conversation
Without lots of reservations on the line
If there's a way to slip around it
Then I'm bound to get around it one more time
Honey you are so persuasive
But it makes me more evasive when you pry
You can label me elusive
But the facts are inconclusive at this time
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind
I've got roses growing over what you'd find
But keep on asking if you're inclined
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind
I don't mean to drive you crazy
Comin' off all vague and hazy just because
I don't have an answer for you
I just wouldn't want to bore you if it does
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind
I've got roses growing over what you'd find
But keep on asking if you're inclined
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind
But keep on asking if you're inclined
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind
Because you can't handle what's on my mindI knew, when you left me, that you'd be back someday
And I know there's a chance you'll leave again
But that's one I've got to take
Girl, after all, what have I got to lose
The worst that you can do is break my heart into
Smaller pieces, bigger teardrops
Colder lonely, hell why not
What's another goodbye
Might as well give it one more try
The worst that you can do is break my heart into
Smaller pieces
Darlin', come on in, what are you waiting for
You might hurt me again
But you can't hurt me anymore
So tell me that you love me
And I'll tell myself it's true
The worst that you can do is break my heart into
Smaller pieces, bigger teardrops
Colder lonely, hell why not
What's another goodbye
Might as well give it one more try
The worst that you can do is break my heart into
Smaller pieces
Hell, why not
What's another goodbye
Might as well give it one more try
Girl the worst that you can do is break my heart into
Smaller pieces
I knew when you left me
That you'd be back somedayPeople tell me I don't look
As good as I used to
And they say I don't act
As nice as I used to
But they don't know the heartbreak
And the pain
I've gone through
I'm not loved by the woman who used to
Somebody else lives in the same house
I used to
And he kisses the same lips
I used to
My ex calls him darling
And all I can do is pretend
But there's really no use to
I used to think life was a song
If it is I've been singing it wrong
World, please forgive anything I might do
But it's more than my heart can get used to
Yes it's more than my heart can get used toYou know me well
I can't sit still
I was raisin' Cain
Now I'm raising babies
Time might pass me by
If I close my eyes
So I'm on the next plane leavin' town
I'll be gone tonight and
You ask why I do it that way
It's just the fear of wasted time
The fear of wasted time
That's why
I hold my babies tight
Sneak into their beds at night
I'll just stay and watch them breathing
Next thing I know the alarm clock's ringing
I watch every frame
Of this life I've made
Take a picture but I miss the moment now
Looking in their eyes
And you ask why I do it that way
It's just the fear of wasted time
The fear of wasted time
That's why
The feeling's very strange
I'm waiting for the pain
And happiness can terrify me now
It could be goodbye
And you ask why I'm that way
It's just the fear of wasted time
The fear of wasted time
That's why, that's why, that's why
That's whyTwenty-five minutes past quitting time
Seven of us crammed into that truck of mine
Paying no attention to them highway signs
Doing ninety miles an hour toward the county line
Quick sack, twelve pack, back again
It's a B double E double, are you N.
My buddies and their babies letting down their hair
As long as we're together it don't matter where
Ain't got a lot of money but we just don't care
Knowing half the fun is getting there
Aztec, long-necks, paychecks spent
oh, it's a B double E double, are you N.
I can't stop thinking
What the hell they were drinking
When they made this county dry
I got a week long thirst
And to make it worse
Lord, it's my turn to drive
Laughing and a bragging and a carrying on
We loaded up the wagons and we headed home
I guess a half a dozen cases doesn't last that long
Come tomorrow morning it'll be all gone
Then, it's turn around, leave town, sounds again
Like a B double E double, are you N.Sometimes I get restless Lord I hate to go home
Tired of livin' with someone and afraid of livin' alone
What an urge to be free now but I'm so used to my chains
I don't know what I want Lord I just want my life to change
And I don't want to stay in the comfort of my empty yesterdays
If I can't find some peace of mind I gotta keep moving gotta keep moving
Yes I spoke of loving but that's all I meant to say
Didn't mean forever no more that I meant a day
I was talkin' about feeling girl not possession of my soul
But you want something more babe you want someone you can hold
And I don't want to stay...
Gotta keep moving gotta keep movingWitness

Kiss me just once more the way you did when you were mine
The longest walk I'll ever take will be across that floor
That's why I'm asking one last favor walk me to the door
I love another won't you let me be these are the words that you said to me
How can I go through life without you like it was before
When I can't even make it to the door
Walk me to the door...
I promise I won't try to make amendsI know I don't deserve you back again
My trembling lips are begging now they never did before
Just one last favor walk me to the door
Walk me to the door...I washed it with water
Made it smell like rosemary
A funny little tearbox
A chest full of laughter
Well I drank hot coffee
Well I drank so much coffee
Now my hair it sticks up like the startled squirrels
It's always four in the morning
To understand all these containers
I'll imitate a mile
Walk with me for awhile
It dissapears like the tearbox
I'll imitate a mile
Walk with me for awhile
It dissapears like the tearboxWalls, we never mean to build them so tall
We lay awake and wish that they'd fall
But they never go away they just tower
There between us till there's nothing left to say
Tears all there is a silents
And tears could this really be what we've feared?
Our perfect love is gone
Just when we thought there was nothing that could write all our wrong
We talked all night long
And we emptied out our hearts 'till all the hurt was gone
And we laughed even though we were mad
And we found out all the problems we had just weren't so bad
Yeah and we talked
We said our peace we cleared the air
Tell your mom thanks for the prayers
Were not all the way back
But hey were getting there
All our friends just can't believe
All the change in you and me
They asked us what we did
And we just smiled and said
We talked all night long
And we emptied our hearts 'till all the hurt was gone
Yeah and we laughed even though we were mad
And we found out all the problems we had just weren't so bad
Oh, we talked yeah, yeah yeah
Oh and it felt so good just talk, yeah yeahHeaven knows how I am here with you
And heaven knows where this is leading to
After all the heartache I've been through
I won't give up on Love
Could have been the way you said 'hello'
Could be something deeper, I don't know
Certain I don't want to see you go
So don't give up on Love
Breathe, and breathe me in
Bless me with your honesty
Your gift for seeing how it is
Will we share this waking mystery?
Walk together, feeling found and free
Face the unhealed space in you and me
And not give up on Love?
I breathe, and breathe you in
You bless me with your honesty
Your gift for telling it like it is
Heaven knows how I am here with you
And heaven knows where this is leading to
But after all the heartache we've been through
Let's not give up on Love
After all the heartache I've been through
I won't give up on Love
On you...You Almost Slipped My Mind
She walked right up to me and took me by the hand
An angel who could please most any man
She said to me I'm free and you're just my kind
And for a moment you almost slipped my mind
Almost you almost slipped my mind
I could taste taste her kisses in the wine
But your mem'ry came and found me just in time
But for a moment you almost slipped my mind
Now I can see how sometimes a man can be so blind
Let himself be led astray become the cheating kind
I'd found myself falling for that same old line
Yes for a moment you almost slipped my mind
Yes for a moment you almost slipped my mindThe dissonant bells of the sea
Who are ringing the rhymes of the deep
As they sing of the ages asleep
Not so near or so far
And the old masters wind of the waves
Sped forth for the free men and slaves
Whispers of secrets it saves
And about whom they are
And the workings of sunshine and rain
And the visions they paint that remain
Pulsate from my soul through my brain
In a Spanish guitar
The beggar whom sits in the street
On his miserable throne of defeat
Envisions no wealth there to meet
Thinking nowhere is far
And the laughter of children employed
By the fantasies not yet destroyed
By the dogmas of those they avoid
Knowing not what they are
And the right and the wrong and insane
And the answers they cannot explain
Pulsate from my soul through my brain
In a Spanish guitar
To play on a Spanish guitar
With the sun shining down where you are
Skipping and singing a bar
From the music around
Just to laugh through the columns of trees
To soar like a seagull in breeze
To stand in the rain if you please
Or to never be foundI've been down with a broken heart
Since the day I learned to speak
The devil gave me a crooked start
When he gave me crooked feet
But Gabriel don came to me
And kissed me in my sleep,
And I'll be singing like an angel
Until I'm six feet deep
I found myself an omen and I tattooed on a sign
I set my mind a wandering and I walk a broken line
You have a mind to keep me quiet
And although you can try,
Better men have hit their knees
And bigger men have died
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one tells
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
You came upon a lightning strike
And eyes of bright clear blue
I took that tie from around my neck
And gave my heart to you
I sent my love across the sea
And though I didn't cry
That voice will haunt my every dream
Until the day I die
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one tells
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
I dug a hole inside my heart
To put you in your grave
At this point it was you and me
And mama didn't raise no slave
You took my face in both your hands
And looked me in the eye
And I went down with such a force
That in your grave I lie
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one's telling
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bellLast night I went out with some old friends of ours
I had stayed till much to late
We sat and we talked till the early hours
Came creeping into my eyes
You weren't invited but all thru the night
My eyes kept on playing strange tricks with the light
You smiled from the shadows and whisper my name
Last night uninvited your memory came
Suddenly out of the blue you'd appear
A sweet mystery seen only by me
I had that old feeling of having you near
Fought back the tears from my eyes
You weren't invited but all thru the night
My eyes kept on playing strange tricks with the light
You smiled from the shadows and whisper my name
Last night uninvited your memory came
I didn't ask you
I didn't want you
To come back and fannin the flames
I tried to prevent you and God knows who sent you
But last night uninvited you came
You weren't invited but all thru the night
My eyes kept on playing strange tricks with the light
You smiled from the shadows and whisper my name
Last night uninvited your memory came
Last night uninvited your memory cameDaddy came home drunk and mean
One too many times
I became his punching bag and
Lie about black eyes
He'd light up a cigarette and
Pop another pill
I can still see the smoke on the hill
Momma tried to fight him off with all her ninety pounds
When you've been beat down all your life
It's hard to stand your ground
I grabbed a stick of stove wood
For a fire I did not build
I can still see the smoke on the hill
Some nights I wake up from a dream
I was laying in sheets soaked in kerosine
When the neighbors came to help
Momma blamed it on the whiskey still
I can still see the smoke on the hill
Momma married a widowed man and moved to Collinwood
I never go back there
Where the old house stood
People still ask questions
And I guess they always will
I can still see the smoke on the hillAs you look into my eyes
and tell those empty lies
I'll pretend they're true
'Cause that's what I do
As you sit and hold my hand
And smile at other men
I'll pretend I'm blind
'Cause I'm just that kind
I'm the king of fools
And I'll always reign
Over loneliness and pain
The king of fools wears his crown
Wherever misery can be found
I'm the king of fools
And I'll always reign
Over loneliness and pain
The king of fools wears his crown
Wherever misery can be foundGo, tell aunt Rhody
The old grey goose is dead
Grandpa found her dying
In the millpond on her head
The Gander won't eat now
Gander won't eat now
Because his wife is dead
Let's pray for the babies
Pray for the babies
Because their mama's dead
Somebody go, tell aunt Rhody
Go, tell aunt Rhody
The old grey goose is dead
Somebody go tell aunt Rhody
I want you to go tell aunt Rhody
Go, tell aunt Rhody
Tell her that the old grey goose is dead
Lord, now go tell aunt Rhody
Children, go tell aunt Rhody
Want you to go tell aunt Rhody
Tell her that the old grey goose is dead
Everybody go tell aunt Rhody
Now, now, go tell aunt Rhody
Now, now, go tell aunt Rhody
Go, tell aunt Rhody
Tell her that the old grey goose is deadTwo doors down there's a jukebox
That plays all night long
Real sad songs
All about me and you
Two doors down there's a barmaid
That serves 'em real strong
Here lately
That's how I make it through
Two doors down there's a heartache
That once was my friend
Two doors down there's a memory
That won't ever end
Two doors down there's a barstool
That knows me by name
And we sit there together
And wait for you
Two doors down there's a bottle
Where I take out my shame
And hold it up
For the whole world to view
Two doors down there's a pay phone
But no calls come in
Two doors down there's a memory
That won't ever end
From the hotel to the barroom
It's just a stumble and a fall
And sometimes when it gets bad
I've been known to crawl
Freedom from sorrow
Is just two doors away
I'll escape for a short time
But I know I can't stay
Two doors down is where they'll find me
When you're finally through
Taking what's left of my life
Two doors down is where they'll leave me
When payment comes due
For the hours I've spent there each night
Two doors down I'll be forgotten
But until then
Two doors down there's a memory
That won't ever end
No it won't ever endIt's the keys to your daddy's car
It's a night alone underneath the desert stars
It's a five o'clock whistle
It's the classroom bell
It's a Panama City at the window yell
A first kiss after a broken heart
We all wanna break the chains
Feel the wind against our face
Everybody wants the same thing
We wanna taste that freedom (freedom)
Everybody 'round here wanna taste that freedom (freedom)
Freedom
It's a pocket full of folded cash
It's telling that boss he can kiss your ass
That tick to your favorite show
Getting lost in the rock 'n roll
Close your eyes, hands up high
Go on and let it all go, oh
We all wanna break the chains
Feel the wind against our face
Everybody wants the same thing
We wanna taste that freedom (freedom)
Everybody 'round here wanna taste that freedom (freedom)
Freedom
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Freedom
Everybody 'round here wanna taste that freedom (freedom, freedom)
That flag on a solider's sleeve
All around the world they know what it means
And they all just wanna little piece of freedom, yeah
That flag on a solider's sleeve
All around the world they know what it means
And they all want just a little piece of this freedom, yeah
We all wanna break the chains
Feel the wind against our face
Everybody wants the same thing
We wanna taste that freedom (freedom)
Everybody 'round here wanna taste that freedom (freedom)
Freedom
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Freedom
Everybody 'round here wanna taste that freedom, freedom
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, ohWhen a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare
I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?
I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?Where were you when the world stopped turnin'
That September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or workin' on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?
Did you weep for the children, they lost their dear loved ones
Pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white, and blue
And the heroes who died just doin' what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN, but I'm not sure I can tell you
The diff'rence in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope, and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love
Where were you when the world stopped turnin'
That September day?
Teachin' a class full of innocent children
Or drivin' down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor?
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you love her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?
Did you open your eyes and hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset for the first time in ages
And speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on I Love Lucy reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Stand in line to give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN, but I'm not sure I can tell you
The diff'rence in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope, and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN, but I'm not sure I can tell you
The diff'rence in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope, and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love
Where were you when the world stopped turnin'
On that September day?FROM A JACK TO A KING
WRITER NED MILLER
From a jack to a king from loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen and walked away with your heart
From a jack to a king with no regrets I stackled the cards last night
And Lady Luck played her hand just right to make me king of your heart
For just a little while I thought that I might lose the game
Then just in time I saw the twinkle in your eye
From a jack to a king from loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen you made me king of your heart
[ guitar ]
For just a little while I thought...Well I've always been a rounder
With a passion for the road
Respect for all the ladies
But easy come and easy go
Love was only in the movies
Not the answer to my dreams
But you're pushin' different buttons
And pullin' different strings
Chorus
You've got my heart a-coverin'
Some unfamiliar ground
I've never felt like this before
Until you came around
If I ain't already fallin'
I guess it could be said
I'm walkin' mighty close to the edge
It's not too late to turn around
But I'm feeling quite concerned
One more kiss might take me
Past the point of no return
Oh, you've got me sendin' flowers
And all sorts of crazy things
I even caught myself a-gazin' at
A fourteen-carat ringBefore you tell me how loud I can play my music
Before you tell me the way I should raise my keys
Before you try to tell me what to say
You might wanna think about it, yeah
Before you turn my family farming to a strip mow
Before you move another factory overseas
Before you go giving my job away
You might want to think about it, yeah
Think about this land that we live in
Of the rights we've been given
And people who die to make us free
Maybe you should stop thinking about the fight you've been picking
And the butt-kicking you'll get from me
You might want to think about it, yeah
Before you try to take away my ten commandments
Before you try to tell me when and where to play
Before you go messing with my fate
You might want to think about it, yeah
Think about the choice that you're making
And the stance that you're taking
Before you come rolling down my street
Maybe you should stop thinking about the fight you've been picking
And the butt-kicking you'll get from me
The eyes whipping you'll get from me
Before you go and try to take away my freedom
Before you go and try to take my voice away
Before you go and make a big mistake
You might wanna think about it
You might wanna think about
You might want to
You might want to
You might wanna think about itCame home to a house
Where everything was emptied
They took my T.V. and my chair
They even found her jewelry
And the police say there's nothing they can do
'Cause it happens everyday
Before I fell asleep when she was cryin'
This is all I could say
What in the world is this world coming to
Can't have a damn thing nice, no use to try to
What is one man feelin' helpless supposed to do
What is in the world is this world comin' to
Come home to a house
Where everything was emptied
She left my T.V. and my chair
Now I', lost in memories
And my friends tell me there's nothing they can do
'Cause it happens everyday
And as I fell asleep that night cryin'
This is all I could say
What in the world is this world coming to
Can't have a damn thing nice, no use to try to
What is one man feelin' helpless supposed to do
What is in the world is this world comin' toUp in the window light tonight
Where I can see your silhouette
I've been throwin' little stones
But I don't believe you've even heard me yet
Today you crossed your heart
And said you'd meet me in the dark
When I called you on the phone
You pretended you weren't home
Hey baby, what do you say
Won't you come on outside tonight
The moon is finally shinin' bright as day
Hey what do you say
Can't you hear the music in the wind
And see our shadows on the ground
Aw won't you come on down
We're gonna do a little fiddlin' around
Can't ya hear the banjo's ringin' through the air
There'll be mandolins and guitars everywhere
Now don't you wanna be there
Hey baby, what do you say
Won't you come on outside tonight
The moon is finally shinin' bright as day
Hey what do you say
Can't you hear the music in the wind
And see our shadows on the ground
Aw won't you come on down
We're gonna do a little fiddlin' around
If you'd look outside, you'd see the lights
Of my old corvette
Are you tryin' to drive me crazy babe
Or did you just forget
Hey baby, what do you say
Won't you come on outside tonight
The moon is finally shinin' bright as day
Hey what do you say
Can't you hear the music in the wind
And see our shadows on the ground
Aw won't you come on down
We're gonna do a little fiddlin' aroundSee that cowboy at the bar
The one at the end with all the scars
He got stomped by the meanest bronc in Santa Fe
But if he looks a little down and out
It ain't that bronc he's thinking about
It's that girl that broke his heart along the way
When a cowboy falls he falls hard
Sometimes he falls way too far
But you can bet that when he hits the ground
He'll get back up and play the part
Even with a broken heart
He'll hold the reins and hide the pain inside
Love's always a cowboy's toughest ride
Girl, just listen to me now
I should know what I'm talking about
Everything I learned I learned from you
I have rode broncs from hell
And it hurt me every time I fell
But not half as much pain as you put me through
When a cowboy falls he falls hard
Sometimes he falls way too far
But you can bet that when he hits the ground
He'll get back up and play the part
Even with a broken heart
He'll hold the reins and hide the pain inside
Love's always a cowboy's toughest rideI won't forget the day I found
My first place on the edge of town
A few milk crates, a beat-up couch and an old T.V.
A little rundown, a little bit small
But to me it was the Taj Mahal
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
Friday night, what the hell, let's go
And just like that we were on a roll
Three best friends and a radio, that was all we'd need
We put a thousand miles on an old red jeep
Just to watch the sun rise on the beach
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
When you're young
There's plenty of time to get older
Once you're old
That's all you'll ever be
Yeah, that's the beauty to livin' life
Wild and free
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
I left home around 22
Mama was beggin' me to finish school
But there was nothing they could do, it was up to me
So I packed my bags and an old guitar
'Cause if you're ever gonna be a star
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
When you're young
There's plenty of time to get older
Once you're old
That's all you'll ever be
Yeah, that's the beauty to livin' life
Wild and free
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
So grow your hair, get a new tattoo
Quit your job and go to Bonnaroo
Whatever it is you wanna do
Or think or be
Don't put it off too many years
'Cause some of the best stuff disappears
I ain't old enough to know but I believe
Yeah, there's some things you gotta be young to seeDON'T MAKE ME DREAM
(Bob Morrison - Wanda Mallette)
'78 Southern Nights Music
I can't believe you're at my door again
You hurt me once I shouldn't let you in
I know you'll always find the way back to my heart
So I'm begging you before you make me start
Don't make me dream if dreaming can't come true
Don't make me dream if I can't have you
Don't make me mad don't make me cry
Don't stay a while then say goodbye
Don't touch the feelings we once knew
Don't make me dream if dreaming can't come true
There was a time I lived to feel your touch
I never knew goodbye could hurt so much
But I still see some magic in your eyes
So don't come back and tell those same sweet lies
Don't make me dream if dreaming can't come true...
Don't make me dream if dreaming can't come true...When you left, i told myself
I wouldn't let you haunt my mind
I'd be strong, i'd carry on
An?leave the past behind
I'd just forget we ever met
An?find somebody new
An?now i want you to know
I'm almost over you
Chorus:
The only time i ever miss you, honey
Is when i'm alone or when i'm with somebody
Your memory never even gets to me
'cept when i'm awake, an?when i'm sleeping
Girl you never even cross my mind
'cept just when i think i left you far behind
Only when i laugh, only when i cry
An?only on days that end in "why"
Now i'll admit, you're hard to quit
I been goin?through a bad withdrawal
But you can bet i had to let
You walk before i'd crawl
I got my pride, wrong or right
I'm gonna stand my ground
An?i ain't gonna let
Your memory get me down
(chorus)
When you walked out, i was just about
To break down an?beg you not to go
But if you want to come home,
I think it's only fair that you should knowChestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Will help to make the season bright
And tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa is on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from 1 to 92
Though it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
They know that Santa is on his way, he's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from 1 to 92
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, yeah, merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas to you
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
Merry ChristmasTwo sides to every story we can't stay this out if we'll take time
Two sides to every story you tell yours and I tell mine
Well where were you last night when I came home
When I came in you were out and gone
Well I waited up till up to two then I went downtown to look for you
So how's about tellin' me where you were at
Well me and the boys stopped off for a drink or two
(Now ain't you a pretty thing)
Well we got to drinkin' and I guess that time just flew
Well the time must've flown for you alright
Cause I thought you're gonna stay out all night
And I told myself I ain't a puttin' up to that
There's always two sides to every story...
You said you went downtown to look for me
Did you have to dress up fancy as could be
You know I never leave the house you know jacky clothes lookin' like slut
And I's downtown just to look in my best for you
Now I'm not accusin' you of doin' wrong
But that's awful late for you to be out and gone
Now look who's talkin' bout bein' late and I wasn't about to sit and wait
Why you were at that when with no tellin' whoThere's not a lot of things to do
I wouldn't rather do with you
Guess I'm funny that way
Lately I just sit and stare
I talk to people who aren't there
To get through one night a day
One night a day
One step away
From leavin' you behind
I sit up with the radio
Sing along with the ones I know
To get through one night a day
One night a day
One step away
From leavin' you behind
I'm callin' every friend I've had
Wake 'em up, and make 'em mad
Let 'em know that I'm OK
I used to sit and talk to you
They're all just a substitute
To get through one night a day
One night a day
One step awayI got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye
Fightin' was against the rules and it didn't matter why
When dad got home I told that story just like I'd rehearsed
Then stood there on those tremblin' knees and waitin' for the worst
And he said
Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us
He said daddies don't just love their children every now and then
It's a love without end, amen
It's a love without end, amen
When I became a father in the spring of '81
There was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father's son
And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end
I took my daddy's secret and passed it on to him
I said
Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us
He said daddies don't just love their children every now and then
It's a love without end, amen
It's a love without end, amen
Last night I dreamed I'd died and stood outside those pearly gates
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake
If they know half the things I've done, they'll never let me in
Then somewhere from the other side, I heard these words again
And they said(C.W. McCall, Bill Fries, Chip Davis)
Dum da-da-dah dum da-da-dah dum da-da-dah dum-dum
Dum da-da-dah dum da-da-dah dum da-da-dah da-da-da
Dum dum da-dum-dum-da-dum
Dum dum da-dum-dum-da-dum (dum, dum)I heard you cry yourself to sleep
And wake up in the night and walk the floor
And I heard you try to tell me something
Just as I was runnin' out the door
And I heard you say "I love you"
So many times I can't recall
But until I heard you say good-bye
I thought I'd heard it all
No, I hadn't heard the fortress
That I'd built around my ego fall apart
That self-destructing unmistaken cryin'
Of my own broken heart
I heard you whisper little things
No one else on earth was meant to hear
And I can't believe it's possible
You're whisperin' in someone else's ear
Until tonight I didn't know how far
A grown man could crawl
Oh, until I heard me beggin' you
I thought I'd heard it all
No, I hadn't heard the fortress
That I'd built around my ego fall apart
That self-destructing unmistaken cryin'
Of my own broken heartI was sitting on my doorstep
I hung up the phone and it fell out of my hand
But I knew I had to do it
And he wouldn't understand
So hard to see myself without him
I felt a piece of my heart break
But when you're standing at a crossroad
There's a choice you gotta make
I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like fallin' when I'm try to fly
It's sad but sometimes
Moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye
I know there's a blue horizon
Somewhere up ahead, just waiting for me
Getting there means leaving things behind
Sometimes life's so bitter sweet
I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like fallin' when I'm try to fly
It's sad but sometimes
Moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye
Time heals the wounds that you feel
Somehow, right now
I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like fallin' when I'm try to fly
It's sad but sometimes
Moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side
Start with goodbye
Like fallin' when you try to fly
It's sad but sometimes
Moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye(Is everybody ready now? Yeah! Okay!)

All the kids singin' in the kitchen bangin' on the pots and pansI dreamed I went to heaven
You were there with me
We walked along the streets of gold
Beside the crystal sea
We heard the angels singing
Then someone called your name
You turned and saw a young man
He was smiling as he came
He said friend, you may not know me now
But then he said but wait
You used to teach my Sunday school
When I was only eight
Every week you would say a prayer
Before the class would start
One morning when you said that prayer
I asked Jesus in my heart
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave
Then another man stood before you
And said remember the time
A missionary came to your church
His pictures made you cry
You didn't have much money
But you gave it anyway
Jesus took the gift you gave
And that's why I'm here today
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave
One by one they came,
As far as the eye could see
Each one somehow touched
By your generosity
Little things that you had done, sacrifices made
Unnoticed on the earth, heaven now proclaims
And I know up in heaven
That you're not supposed to cry
But I was almost sure
There were tears in your eyes
As Jesus took your hand
And you stood before the Lord
And He said my child look around you
For great is your reward
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave
I am so glad you gave
I am so glad you gaveIn a little while she'll come to wake me just like always
She'll lean down and sweetly press her lips on mine
And say good morning daddy good morning how I love this little girl of mine
Then we both sit at the table having coffee
She says mama put a lot of milk in mine
Just like daddy's mama just like daddy's oh how I love this little girl of mine
Then one day she'll grow up and be gone and she'll have a small one of her own
But right now she's still my baby just like always
And I'm glad it's gonna be a long long time
I'll hear good morning daddy good morning how I love this little girl of mine
Oh how I love this little girl of mineGirl look at you right there with that wind in your hair
Like a dream in the sunset light
I couldn't love you anymore, I couldn't love you any less
I guess I'm doing something right
But girl you gotta promise me
That if you ever have to leave
Baby lie to me 'cause I couldn't stand the truth
And I couldn't bear the thought of losin' you
Baby lie to me, tell me everything's all right
And when I'm sound asleep, you can fade into the night
Girl, instead of sayin' goodbye
Just lie to me
Last night when I saw you in a dream, you were packing' your things
And baby it all seemed so real
You came to tell me you were gone, my life had ended like a song
Felt as bad as I could feel
So if there ever comes a day
That you wanna walk away
Baby lie to me 'cause I couldn't stand the truth
And I couldn't bear the thought of losin' you
Baby lie to me, tell me everything's all right
And when I'm sound asleep, you can fade into the night
Girl, instead of sayin' goodbye
Just lie to meAs I turn my head to your side of the bed
While you wake, What's on your mind?
To this awful news try not to hold on
The day will come, the sun will rise, and we'll be fine
As long as I feel, as strong as I feel
I will carry you as long as I can
As hard on yourself, please pardon yourself
Do the best you can and that won't go unseen
How do I know when it's time to stop?
Runnin' from the things I do, being things I'm not
Oh I have tried, but I just changed my mind
Every night befalls every morning light
How do I know that you will never stop?
Knowin' me, and trustin' me, and lovin' me a lot
Oh I have tried, but I just changed my mind
Every night befalls every morning light
Well there's only so many ways
You can give your loving to me
I'd give my soul for just for one of them now
I'd give up the drinking, just tell me how
And there's only so many years
I'm going to give my love to you
And I spent the last one hidden away
Screaming my lungs out with nothing to say
As I turn my head to your side of the bed
While you wake, What's on your mind?
To this awful news try not to hold on
The day will come, the sun will rise, and we'll be fineSee that engine puffin' boy she's making time
That old train's blowin' off the rail rail rail
Headin' for the mountain that she's got to climb
Bringin' in the Georgia mail
Ninety miles an hour and she's gaining speed
Listen to the whistle moan and wail wail wail
Has she got the power I'll say yes indeed
Bringin' in the Georgia mail
Seein' drivers travel watch her spin the track
Ought to put that engineer in jail jail jail
Has she got her rollin' watch her ball the jack
Bringin' in the Georgia mailThere she goes
Little black dress on
Standing with the other girls
Wearing velvet and pearls looking so fine, so fine
All the time that she try to catch my eye
Now I hear that she's crushing on another guy
Why do we always want what we can't have oh oh oh oh
I never really wanted, never really wanted that girl
I never really wanted , wanted her in my world
I never really wanted that girl over now I do
I never noticed how
A woman's eyes can dance
But from the outside in looks like the dancing for him
Leads me wondering, wondering
Why isn't now I see her in a different light
If I could turn back time I would tonight
Why do we always want what we can't have oh oh oh oh
I never really wanted, never really wanted that girl
I never really wanted , wanted her in my world
I never really wanted that girl over now I do oh oh oh
You better get that girl while get good
There a list of fools who wish they could
Why do we always want what we can't have? Oh!
I never really wanted, never really wanted that girl
I never really wanted, wanted her in my world
I never really wanted that girl over now I do, yeah.
I never really wanted, never really wanted that girl
I never really wanted, wanted her in my world
I never really wanted that girl over now I do
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeahLying in my bed, I hear
The clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind
Suitcases of memories, time after
Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you say go slow, I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you and I'll be waiting
Time after timeFar, far away is my love of yesterday
And she's gone, gone, gone, gone from me, from me
Far, far away is my life, my love, my way
And wonder, where, where, where, oh, where can she be?
Days endless, days nights, dark
As may lonely, I'm lonely where can she be?
Far far away is my love of yesterday
Wonder, where, where, where, where, where, oh, where can she be?
Far, far awayMuskrat, Muskrat, wha makes your head so slick?
I've been a-livin' in the water so long, it's a
Wonder I ain't sick, I ain't sick, I ain't sick...
Well, Groundhog, Groundhog, why is your back
So brown?
It's a wonder I don't smother to death from livin'
In the ground, in the ground, in the ground...
Jaybird, Jaybird, why do you fly so high?
I've been eatin them acerns all my life, it's a
Wonder I don't die, I don't die, I don't die...
Now, rooster, rooster, why is your claw so hard?
Iv'e been scratchin' in the barnlot all my life, and it's a
Wonder I ain't tired, I ain't tired, I ain't tired...Come on baby it's a quarter to five
I've been living on the couch and I'm losing my mind
I haven't gotten a touch in a long, long time
Since Friday XIII part nine, going to hell
Thumbing through all the magazines
And I can drink a lot better than I could in my teens
Have we learned nothing but to kick and scream?
We're as civilized as we could have ever dreamed and what's that mean?
Come on baby won't you feel alright?
It feels like forever since I've been warm at night
So let's get back to what all that was fair and just
Oh won't you please love me again?
The kind of attraction I couldn't leave
Keep watching the static on TV
Might be as well but not as bad
When your silence shows of our public failure
I woke up in the middle of the night
Sheets soaked, still drunk, terrified
Something tells me you're not alive
The pulse keeps getting softer
Come on baby won't you feel alright?
It feels like forever since I've been warm at night
So let's get back to what all that was fair and just
Oh won't you please love me again?
Come on, baby
You've got something to lose
I'll buy you new clothes
I'll buy you new shoes
All kinds of things that we could really use
But all I need is you
I need you girl, you got that heart and soul
We've been living in the dark and digging our holes
But all that we need's right under our nose
Boy, don't you think I know?
I guess so
Come on baby won't you feel alright?
It feels like forever since I've been warm at night
So let's get back to what all that was fair and just
Oh won't you please love me again?
Please love me again(E. Kaz)
Of all the roads I've traveled and all the sights I've seen
The most amazing thing is the power of our dreams
And anything is possible for those who can believe
Just get your heart to rearrange its priorities
For us to make love work
We've got to try a little harder
And for love to work we gotta hold on
A human heart is just too precious
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work
It takes faith in one another to see things eye to eye
And it's hard to trust but you know it's worth the try
There's a candle in my window and whenever you feel blue
You can bet your bottom dollar I'll be there for you
For us to make love work
We've got to try a little bit harder
And for love to work we gotta hold on
A human heart is just too precious
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work
Oh I do believe in miracles
But I know they don't come easy
So why don't we give destiny
A helping hand
For us to make love work
We've got to try a little bit harder
And for love to work we gotta hold on
A human heart is just too precious
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work
Life is just too beautiful
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love workI often dream of trains when I'm alone
I ride on them into another zone
I dream of them constantly
Heading for paradise
Or Basingstoke
Or Reading
I often dream of trains when I'm awake
They ride along beside a frozen lake
And there in the buffet car
I wait for eternity
Or Basingstoke
Or Reading
I often dream of trains till it gets light
The summer turns to winter overnight
The leaves fall so suddenly
The sun sets at four o'clock
Exactly what
I'm dreading
I often dream of trains when I'm with you
I wonder if you dream about them too
Maybe we'll meet one night
Out in the corridor
I'm waiting for
You baby
Baby
Baby
Baby
Baby...Silent night holy night all is calm all is bright
Round young virgin mother and child holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night holy night shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar heavenly hosts sing hallelujah
Christ the Savior is born Christ the Savior is born
Silent night holy night son of God love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face with the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at Thy birth Jesus Lord at Thy birthDon't think that I don't see the way you struggle
Watching me struggle
Don't think that I don't feel you turn away
Every time I turn away
And please believe that I believe
When I'm praying
That you're right beside me praying
For the same thing
You're 5' 3" born in Carolina
Front pew pretty
And Friday night free
You're dashboard singing
Little red Corvette
Sweet as forgiveness
From the moment that we met
I never knew I had a fighter
I know when you're silent
The silence says more than a scream
And I know when you say that you hate me
It ain't what you mean
When you say that you'll leave and you'll leave
But only for a while
For just a while
You're stubborn and strong
Crazy as New Orleans
Your faded blue denim
A diamond on the town
My t-shirt in the morning
Midnight in my hands
At day you're still here, I just don't understand
Never knew I had a fighter
Just when I thought I knew everything about you
You're 5' 3" born in Carolina
Still front pew pretty
And Friday night free
You're dashboard singing
Little red Corvette
Sweet as forgiveness
From the moment that we met
I Never knew I had a fighter
I Never knew I had a fighter
Please believe that I believe
When I'm praying
That you're right beside me praying
Never knew I had a fighter(Paul Hampton, Sage Allen)
I got plan; yeah, a plot's what I got
To help this country rise again
All a' the haves
Join the have-nots
And strip our fears off while we can
[Chorus; C.W. only]
We've gotta kidnap America
Hold it for ransom
Put a price on our own head
And we won't give back America
'Til ev'ry one of us
Start payin' up, stop playin' dead
Hold up your head
You got it up?
Doomsday's been comin' for a hundred years
But it's not here yet
An' it ain't a-gonna come
Unless we drown in our own tears
[Chorus; the other singers]
We've gotta kidnap America
Hold it for ransom
Put a price on our own head
And we won't give back America
'Til ev'ry one of us
Start payin' up, stop playin' dead
Stand up, Americans!
We are the people!
And the shirt's bein' stripped right off of our backs
We've let it happen
And we've gotta stop it
Before the spirit of sweet Liberty cracks
You guys in office!
You better listen!
We're sick an' tired of gettin' took
This ain't no crap game!
This is our future!
So run this country by the book
Pay up with courage!
Don't die for terror
We got the guts; we're the home of the brave
Well the home may be crumblin'
But not the foundation
It's still as strong as the day it was laid
[Chorus; the other singers]
We've gotta kidnap America
Hold it for ransom
Put a price on our own head
And we won't give back America
'Til ev'ry one of us
Start payin' up, stop playin' dead
I wanna thank ya
For your timeI bless the day I found you I want to stay around you and so I beg you let it be me
Don't take this heaven from one if you must cling to someone
Now and forever let it be me
Each time we meet love I find complete love
Without your sweet sweet love what would life be
So never leave me lonely tell me you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me
Now and forever let it be meYou took her from my side
The day you took her from me
And you though that it would hurt my pride
But there were things you failed to see.
You thought you stole away her love
But I want the world to know
It's the truth she turned her back on me
But I was glad to let her go.
Yes, you thought that you were foolin' me
And even though it wasn't right
Let me thank you for you set me free
From a lot of sleepless nights.
My love for her had died
Yes, it was over long ago
And it's true she walked away with you
But I was glad to let her go.
Yes, you knew that you were cheating me
And even though it wasn't right
Let me thank you for you set me free
From a lot of sleepless nights.
My love for her had died
Yes, it was over long ago
And it's true she walked away with you
But I was glad to let her go...There's a tree out in the backyard
That never has been broken by the wind
And the reason its still standing
It was strong enough to bend
For years, we have stayed together
As lovers and as friends
What we have will last forever
If we're strong enough to bend
When you say something that you can't take back
Big wind blows and you hear a little crack
When you say "Hey well I might be wrong"
You can sway with the wind till the storm is gone
Sway with the wind till the storm is gone
Like a tree out in the backyard
That never has been broken by the wind
Our love will last forever
If we're strong enough to bend
When you start thinkin' that you know it all
Big wind blows and a branch will fall
When you say "Hey this job takes two"
We can sway with the wind till the skies turn blue
Sway with the wind till the skies turn blue
Like a tree out in the backyard
That never has been broken by the wind
Our love will last forever if we're strong enough to bend
Our love will last forever if we're strong enough to bendO holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh night, divine
Oh night, when Christ was born
Oh night, divine
Oh night
Oh, night divine
Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother
And in His name, all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy
In grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name
Christ is the Lord
Oh, praise His name forever
His power and glory ever more proclaim
His power and glory ever more proclaim
Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
His power and glory ever more proclaim
Oh night, divine
Oh night, when Christ was born
His power and glory ever more proclaimTake me home I don't want to roam no more
Well I've been from Boston to LA seen Boulder Dam and Frisco Bay
I been to New York City and Washington
Montreal and Saskatchewan (and Rhode Island)
And I've worked in three all night service stations and drove a truck
Take me home my heart is heavy and my feet are sore
Take me home I don't want to roam no more
Well I've slept all night in a water trough
Had the flu and the croup and the whoopin' cough
I had the mumps and the measles and the seven years itch
And I can't count the times that I've had a cold (and a sore throat)
Not to mention all the times that I've cut my fingers on a sardine can
Take me home...
Well I can just see 'em all gatherin' round
Mama's supper table as the sun goes down
And my dear old daddy when the blessing is said
Fillin' up his plate with black eyed peas (and side meat)
And a great big hunk of my dear sweet mama's hot buttered cornbread
Take me home...
Take me home...It was so right
It was so wrong
Almost at the same time
The pain and ache
A heart can take
No one really knows
But when the memories cling and take you there
Till you no longer care
You can let go now
It's not right for me
To cling to you
Somehow I just needed time
From what was to be
It's not like me
To hold somebody down
But I was tossed high by love
Almost never came down
Only to land
Where no love is found
And I'm no longer bound
I can let go nowA white sport coat and a pink carnation
I'm all dressed up for the dance.
A white sport coat and a pink carnation,
I'm all alone in romance.
Once you told me long ago, to the prom with me
you'd go, now you've changed your mind,
it seems someone else will hold my dreams.
A white sport coat and a pink carnation,
I'm in a blue, blue mood.I don't want to tie you down
With some lines spoken in sorrow
With some hopes pinned on tomorrow
You've got your bedroll and your guitar
And there you are
Ready to be alone, rolling stone
I don't want the phone to ring
I can't talk when I'm crying
Your voice shakes when you're lying
Saddle the wind and ride for the sun
The way you run
You'll never have a home, rolling stone
But if you don't love what you've found
Just remember the world is round
And whatever rolls away
Can always roll back home some day
When you sleep beneath the sky
With your coat making your pillow
As the wind cries on the willows
And your bed holds no tenderness
Remember this
You made it on your own, rolling stone, roll onIT WAS FUN WHILE IT LASTED
(Bill Anderson)

RECORDED BY ROY DRUSKY
I just read the saddest letter and before I cry I'd better
Let you know that I won't stand in your way
I'm your old love he's your new love but if you're sure it's true love
I'll bow out gracefully and simply say
It was fun while it lasted fun while it lasted ours was a special sort of love
It was fun while it lasted fun while it lasted but it just didn't last long enough
I can't say goodbye with laughter but I'll promise ever after
When I'll think of you my lonely lips will smile
I'll be all alone tomorrow but there won't be any sorrow
Just a happy thought you love me for a mile
It was fun while it lasted...Ain't but a half a mile between the city limit signs
Population nine hundred 'n' nine
A lotta front porch swingin', down home livin'
Friday night hell raisin', Sunday morning repentance
We got our gossip goin' on down at Betty's Beauty Shop
They're sellin' 90 proof corn juice out back at the co-op
Judge Taylor likes to fight when his potbelly's full of beer
Theres always somethin' goin' on
But there ain't nothin' goin' wrong around here
We got kids burnin' rubber 'round the old town square
Tall tales being told in Harry's barber chair
Life moves slow
There's always somethin' goin' on
But there ain't nothin goin' wrong around here
Old men bettin' on the weather on the courthouse stairs
Luther wackin' off weeds in his underwear
They go moon skinny-dippin' this time of year
Theres always somethin' on
But there ain't nothin' goin' wrong around here
Other than kids burnin' rubber 'round the old town square
Tall tales bein' told in Harry's barber chair
Life moves slow
There's always somethin' goin' on
But there ain't nothin' goin' wrong around hereSugar pie honey bunch you know that I love you
I can't help myself I love you and nobody else
Wanna tell in and out my life you come and go
Leaving just your picture behind
and I kissed it a thousand times
When you snap your finger or wink your eye I come a running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings and there's nothing I can do
Sugar pie honey bunch I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself I'm a fool in love you see
Wanna tell you I don't love you tell you that we're through and I've tried
But every time I see your face I get all choked up inside
When I call your name girl it starts the flame burning in my heart
tearin it all apart no matter how I try my love
I cannot hide 'causeWell it's a sweet dream
That keeps me close to you dear
And it's a sad thing
That we're apart, I'm blue dear
And there are times now
I thank the heavens up above
When I'm with the one that I love
Now there are diamonds
That some may long to see
And they may shine
But not bright enough for me
I wouldn't take no
The whole world dipped in gold
For a night with my Tennessee Rose
Take this love that I am giving
For it's truly the lasting kind
The gift I hold is believing
That you will always be mine
Take this love that I am giving
For it's truly the lasting kind
The gift I hold is believing
That you will always be mine
Oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh, oh ohSeems we always have to slip around to be together dear
Slippin' around afraid we'd might be found
I know I can't forget you and I've got to have you near
But we'll just just have to slip around and live in constant fear
Though you're tied up with someone else and I'm all tied up too
Oh I know I've made mistakes dear but I'm so in love with you
I hope someday I'll find a way to bring you back to me
And I won't have to slip around to have your company
[ piano ]
Though you're tied up with someone else...
And I won't have to slip around to have your companyDon't choose me because I am kind
If your heart settles on me
I'm for the taking
Take me for longing or leave me behind.
I would be, for you, a fire in a rainbow
I would be, for you, an opening door
Time and hard lessons are one kind of wisdom
Try to forget them or love me no more.
--- Instrumental ---
I'm not asking your heart to believe me
I'm not asking for promise or pledge
Whatever the answer, it's yes that's the question
I am the fool dancin' over the edge.
--- Instrumental ---
Don't choose me because I am faithful
Don't choose me because I am kind
If your heart settles on me, I'm for the taking
Take me for longing or leave me behind...(Dolly Parton)
If you hear me crying in the night
Pretend that you don't hear me it's alright
Don't ask me why I'm crying, please don't make a sound
I don't know why, it's just the way I am
And if you think I act a little strange
And you don't understand when I do things
Like running through the fields while the rain is pouring down
I don't know why, it's just the way I am
And even though you may not understand me
I hope that you'll accept me like I am
For there are many sides of me, my mind and spirit must be free
And I might smile when other folks would frown
I don't know why, it's just the way I am
I might go out chasing butterflies
And if I fail to catch one I might cry
And if you want me you might find me in the meadow walking 'round
I don't know why, it's just the way I am
I might be home and busy cleaning house
And in the middle of my work I might go out
And go play games with children at the playground
It makes me happy, and that's just the way I am
And even though you may not understand me
I hope that you'll accept me like I am
For there are childish sides of me
My mind and spirit must be free
I might smile when you think I should frown
I don't know why, it's just the way I am(We're rollin')
Back in the days
When we used to dance
You chuckle every time that I misstep
Now that we're older
And our hairs get grey
You never cut me slack for my mistakes
You know I never meant to sink to such depths
Why would I jeopardize what we built behind that fence?
Stay with me baby when you can
Its a pain to see but I'm still your man
Back in our time
Before the children
We were all the envy of our friends
Then we were blessed
Three little babies
Whatever broke we built it up again
You know I never meant to sink to the bottom
Why would I jeopardize what I built as a father?
Stay with me on some lost weekend
It's a pain to see but our hearts we can mend
Back in the days
When we used to dance
You'd chuckle every time that I misstep
Now that we're older
And our hairs get grey
You never cut me slack for my mistakes
You know I never meant to sink to such depths
Why would I jeopardize what we built behind that fence?
Stay with me baby when you can
It's a pain to see but you're still my man
It's a pain to see but I'm still your manThere you were standing there smiling as you made your plans
You were going to leave me and go with him
You said you loved him so and your love would always be
And that's the very same thing you once told to me
And you still had my little golden band on your hand
Does my little band of gold mean nothing to you
To me it means the world but you've torn my world apart
You're leaving me alone with my broken heart
There you were standing there
So take my little golden band from your hand
My little band of gold means nothing to you
To me it meant the world but you've torn my world apart
You're leaving me alone with my broken heart
You're leaving me alone with my broken heartI was lonely I guess the night that we met in a tavern down on old Broadway
And there were tears in her eyes and she whispered with a sigh
Stranger please take me out of here
But it was only commercial affection cause a fool and his money will part
Yes it was only commercial affection but she walked away with my heart
[Steel, Piano Interlude]
I stood in disbelief as she hurried off to meet another fool down on old Broadway
Now many nights have come and gone still the echo lingers on
Stranger please take me out of here
But it was only commercial affection...Baby oh baby tell the man at the ticket stand that you've changed your mind
Let me run on out and tell the cab to keep his meter flyin'
'Cause if you say goodbye to me babe you're gonna break my mind
Break my mind break my mind
You know I just can't stand to hear them big jet engines whine
Break my mind break my mind oh Lord
'Cause if you leave you're gonna leave a babblin' fool behind
Baby oh baby let me take your suitcases off of the scales in time
Tell the man that you've suddenly developed a thing about flyin'
'Cause if you say goodbye to me babe you're gonna break my mind
Break my mind break my mind...
If you'll say goodbye to me babe you're gonna break my mind break my mindI'm the only one that wants me but me wants only you
My arms reach out to empty space where you used to be
I kiss the picture in our room and your picture kisses me
I tell myself I love you the way you used to do
I'm the only one that wants me but me wants only you
I'm the only one that wants me since you put me down
That's why I pick me up each night and go out on the town
I take me to the places where we used to randezvous
I'm the only one that wants me but me wants only you
I take me out every night to show me a good kind
I order dinner just for one at the place we used to dine
When it gets late at time to leave I pretend the leave with you
I'm the only one that wants me but me wants only youBusted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord,
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGeeMight be in the middle of the afternoon
Might be somewhere in the middle of the night
I might not be thinking anything at all
When a perfect strangers face catches certain light
My heart jumps cause all at once there you are
Standing right in front of me
There you are as lovely as you'll always be
Here I go
Back into those memories
Where you are still in love with me
I know I'll never hold you in my arms again
I know I'll never hear you speak my name
I look around this lonely room
And I can see your memories is the only thing that hasn't changed
And I close my eyes and every time there you are
Standing right in front of me
There you are as lovely as you'll always be
Here I go
Back into those memories where you are still in love with meA drift of wild turkeys
In the field across the way.
I'm standing, staring, waiting
For those coyotes to make a play
But they never do.
So I move on.
A pack of wild children
In the field across the street
I'm standing, staring, waiting
For the bell to set them free
But it never does.
So I move on.
51 years, a child upon the Earth,
Trying to find the answers
Without digging in the dirt
So I'll never know.
And I'll move on.Although you mean and throw to me just like a fool won't set you free
I love you so oh don't you know it has to be
Although at times your love's not true though you've had friends
I know not who can't let you go, I love you so it has to be
Well, you can't be happy, no use to try, I wouldn't be satisfied
If you were gone and I was not by your side
Although the tears off dim my eyes, I'm not too fit to sit and cry
It's half a true it's only you, it has to be
Well, you can't be happy, no use to try, I wouldn't be satisfied
If you were gone and I was not by your side
Although the tears off dim my eyes, I'm not too fit to sit and cry
It's half a true it's only you, it has to beI wasn't fooling around
Everything's true that I said
So take me seriously
Darling, please just take me
I wasn't fooling around
Laugh if you want to
But I wasn't joking
About this love that's so real
Is it surprising
I'm romanticizing
About the way I feel
I wasn't playing around
I'm not a kid anymore
I'm not the clown
That's just here to amuse you
I wasn't fooling around
Laugh if you want to
But I wasn't joking
About this love that's so real
Is it surprising
I'm romanticizing
About the way I feelThere's folks building homes as sweet as can be
They're levelling their yards and planting their trees
But my little hut I'll just let it be
Lord Jesus is building a mansion for me
A mansion for me (a mansion for me)
A mansion for me (a mansion for me)
Built by my Lord beyond Calvary
But my little hut I'll just let it be
Lord Jesus is building a mansion for me
Each day I am getting more ready to go
He's cleansing my sins more whiter than snow
I'm packing my troubles I'm bound with his love
Get ready to move to Heaven above
To you who have homes in this world below
Driving fine cars wherever you go
There's coming a time when we'll all pass away
Get ready to move with me on that dayWould you walk to the edge of the ocean?
Just to fill my jar with sand?
Just in case I get the notion,
To let it run through my hands.
Let it run through my hands.
I don't want the whole world,
The sun, the moon and all their light.
I just wanna be the only girl,
You love all your life.
You love all your life.
Would you catch a couple thousand fireflies?
Yeah, and put 'em in a lamp to light my world.
All dressed up in a tux and bowtie.
Hand Delivered to a lonely girl.
To a lonely lonely girl
I don't want the whole world,
The sun, the moon and all their light.
I just wanna be the only girl,
You love all your life.
You love all your life
Lately I've been writing desperate love songs.
I mostly sing them to the wall.
You could be the center piece of my obsession
If you would notice me,
Yeah, ooh yeah
Well I don't want the whole world, no
The sun, the moon and all their light.
I just wanna be the only girl,
You love all your life.
You love all your life
You love all your life, life, yeah.Two happy people on a Greyhound bus
We came here looking for a life for us
But the nightlife is her new life and the only thing I've found
Is San Francisco is a lonely town
Oh there were good times for a little while
But now her new friends say I cramp her style
I guess I'm only in the way now she don't need me hanging round
Oh San Francisco is a lonely town
Now she's out there somewhere cross San Francisco Bay
She'll be wondering where I am when she gets in today
She'll find I left her a oneway ticket home
And while she stands there cryin' all alone
And while this Greyhound keeps on rolling I'll pray Lord she's found
San Francisco is a lonely townI heard some kids telling me
How they've lost all faith, in the world
They've been talking world peace now
And the wars in the streets
The lines on their faces so deep
A revolution, or reach out and touch the day
We're overdue, it's time
Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time for change
Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time for change
I feel the future
In the hands of our youth, will be saved
No more lies
Old, tired fools tell our future
With tarrot cards, and lie of crime
The lines on their faces so deep
A revolution, or reach out and touch the day
We're overdue, it's time
Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time for change
Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time for change
I'll change
Yes I'll change
Not tomorrow, but today
Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time
Now it't time for change
Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time for change
Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time
Now it's time for change
Now it' time
Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time for changeThem bareback horses are the only thing
They make your back hurt they make your bell ring
They're hard on tailbones and they make your neck sore
But when it's all over you're craving some more
Well you drive down the road in a broke down car
You stop in some town you wonder where in the hell you are
You get yourself a road map and head out once again
With only enough for fees so you'd damn sure better win
You finally make the pitchin' with your entry fees all paid
You get on another snatcher and he flings you away
So you head to town broken hearted lookin' for a chance
To get a little drunk and find some girl and dance
Well you meet a little girl at the bar all alone
You whoop some words on her to get her to take you home
But she's got a big boyfriend who just came from the can
And he says move on there buddy cause he's her lovin' man
So you climb back in your car after your little bitty fight
You're drunk and broken hearted
And it's twelve o'clock at night
And you ain't got a dime in your old blue jeans
But by God you got a half a tank of gas
And a can of pork and beans
You write a hot check to pay your fees once again
You got yourself a good one so you ought to win
The horse is standin' in the chute then he bucks around
The whistle blows then you're standin' on the ground
The judges total their markings and they tally up the score
And you're beatin' everybody by at least ten points or more
So you climb back in your car with a pocket full of cash
A good feelin' in your heart and a tank full of gas
But boys the day finally comes when you get old and grey
You gotta hang your spurs up and put your riggin' away
You look back now with a wantin' eye
But brother it's all gone so you sit and cryMy friends they told me you change like the weather
From one love to another you would go
But when I first met you your love was like the summer
Love I never dreamed of turning cold
But then the autumn leaves started falling from the trees
In your heart the season grew colder
The wind began to blow and the clouds began to snow
When your love turned from summer to winter
As the sunlight touches the face of a flower that's how soft your lips were to mine
Your love to me was just like the summer a sweeter love I knew I'd never find
But then the autumn leaves...I never was the kind to wear my feelings on my sleeve
But since I met you girl, there's been a world of change in me
I've got to say I love you, hope you like the sound of that
'Cause I can't keep it under this ol' hat
[Chorus]
Under this ol' hat
Is the head you turned around
And the heart you stole away
The day we met
under this ol' hat's
Two arms that long to hold you tight
And boots I'd walk the soles off of
To be here by your side
And every night in my prayers there's just
One thing I ask
That the man you love will always be
Under this ol' hat
You've got me feeling things
I've never felt before
And it's so good to know when I come a knocking at your door
That of all the men who'd love to waltz across your welcome mat
The one you want is under this ol' hat
[Chorus]You tell yourself it's alright
Out of mind and out of sight
But you rest a little less at night
and think a little more
'Cause the truth is like a shadow
Follows you where ever you go
It sleeps on your pillow
And waits behind the door
CHORUS
It's hard to be honest
It seems like it's beyond us
Gonna take a lot of blind faith
To look it in the eye
Gonna have ta hurt some
Gonna have ta work some
It's hard to be honest
It's easier to lie...
A lie is like a slow train
Driving through a hard rain
Heading down a steep grade
Pickin' up speed
Next thing you know you're standing
In the middle of a wreckage
Staring at the damage
You never thought you'd see
It's hard to be honest
It seems like it's beyond us
Gonna take a lot of blind faith
To look it in the eye
Gonna have ta hurt some
Gonna have ta work some
It's hard to be honest
It's easier to lie...
Gonna have ta hurt some
Gonna have ta work some
It's hard to be honest
It's easier to lie...We say Deo, Deo, Deo
Roll that barrel out
We say Deo, Deo
Twist the tap and pass it around
He owns a Graddel by a banyan tree
In old Jamacia called the ocean breeze
His face is kind as it is creased
From tossin nets off an old boat bow.
But old Jamal is a mariners son
Will tell you where the ships would run
And if your down there ask him to pour ya one
And you'll hear that sailor shout
Chorus
He'll say Deo, Deo, Deo
Roll that barrel out
He'll say Deo Deo
Twist the tap and pass it around
His mama told him when he was young
you'll work the fields till you grow up
while she tapped the barrels in the cantina
for soldier boys passing by
His big brown eyes and little feet
For years they worked the coco bean
But he'd have visions of pirates when he would fall asleep
And they sang him this lullaby,
Chorus
He'll say Deo, Deo, Deo
Roll that barrel out
He'll say Deo Deo
Twist the tap and pass it around
Hey hey!
solo
We met Jamal when we arrived
He told a story round a fire last night,
You shoulda seen that beach come alive
When he sang us his island song
Yeah and we all sang along
Chorus
We'll say Deo, Deo, Deo
Roll that barrel out
We'll say Deo Deo
Twist the tap and pass it around
Twist the tap and pass it around
Twist the tap and pass it aroundYou can cry, cry, cry like the rain
Ocean full of tears won't drown the pain
Take all your whiskey, pour it down the drain
Ain't nothin' gonna make you feel better
Oh, she's a little heartwrecker [Repeat: x2]
You can beg, beg, beg like a dog
Chase her 'round the world, but she'll still be gone
She did you right once, but left you all wrong
Now you're chewin' on a Dear John letter
Oh, she's a little heartwrecker
She takes a big black ball
And a long strong chain
And she lets it fall
Again and again and again and again and again
She's a little heartwrecker
Sing, sing, sing a sad song
Honky tonk jukebox playin' along
Until your last buddy and your money's gone
But still you can't not remember
So you pray, pray, pray like a saint
Promise your maker all kinds of things
He don't answer, but you know He'd say
Son you better just forget her
Oh, she's a little heartwrecker
She takes a big black ball
And a long strong chain
And she lets it fall
Again and again and again and again and again
She's a little heartwrecker
She was a sweet, sweet, sweeter than wine
Never knew nothin' could be so fine
So you took it all out and laid it on the line
Best you ever had only better
Oh, she's a little heartwrecker [Repeat: x3]WHERE HAVE ALL THE FLOWERS GONE

(Ray Pennington)
'66 Tree Publishing, BMI
(What does your conscience say to you)
When you're with your somebody new and he holds you in his arms
Don't you know you're not lovin' by the rules
If you would stop and search your mind imagine what you'd find
What would your conscience say to you
Tell me do you think he'll love you and that he'll be true
If he'll take you from me he'll leave you for someone too
But let your conscience be your guide so many times I've heard you say
What does your conscience say to you
Now you know I've always been true and I tried to do my part
There's no reason to treat me like you do
What makes you think his love will last compare your future with your past
What does your conscience say to you
Oh tell me do you think he'll love you...(Billy Dean)
I came home from college to see my old man
He was sittin' on the porch swing, with a book in his hand
He stared at my earring, and at my tattoo
He smiled and shook his head and said
It's good to see you
He chose his words carefully cause it was hard for me to come
And he knew I had ta temper and where I got it from
I waited for the sermon, the one I knew so well
But this time he wasn't preachin'
About heaven or hell
He said a real man knows the value of a woman
A real man has got nothin to prove
He's strenthened by love
And the Lord up above
So do the best that you can
To be a real man
Could it be that I saw just a glimpse of his soul
Or maybe losin' Mama had just taken it's toll
He gave me his Bible, stained with tears he had cried
And I opened up the cover
Where he wrote inside
And it said
A real man has got nothin to prove
He's strenthened by love
And the Lord up above
So do the best that you can
To be a real man
Do the best that you can
To be a real manA-rovin' on a winter's night
And a-drinkin' good old wine,
Thinkin' about that pretty little girl,
That broke this heart of mine.
She is just like a bud of rose,
That blooms in the month of June.
Or like some musical instrument,
That's just been lately tuned.
Perhaps it's a trip to some foreign land,
A trip to France or Spain,
But if I should go ten thousand miles,
I'm a-comin' home again.
And it's who's a-gonna shoe your poor little feet,
Who's a-gonna glove your little hands?
Who's a-gonna kiss your sweet little lips,
Honey, who's a-gonna be your man?
I love you till the sea runs dry,
And the rocks all melt in the sun.
I love you till the day I die,
Though you will never be my own.I'm going to that east pay road
I'm going to that east pay road
I'm going to the east
I going to the west
I'm going to the one that I love best
Roll on, buddy, roll on
Roll on, buddy, roll on
You wouldn't roll so slow
If you knew what I know
So roll on, buddy, roll on
I've got a good woman just the same
I've got a good woman just the same
My woman just the same
Says she's gonna change her name
I've got a good woman just the same
Roll on, buddy, roll on
Roll on, buddy, roll on
You wouldn't roll so slow
If you knew what I know
So roll on, buddy, roll on
My home is down in Tennessee
My home is down in Tennessee
In Tennessee
That's where I long to be
Way down in sunny Tennessee
Roll on, buddy, roll on
Roll on, buddy, roll on
You wouldn't roll so slow
If you knew what I know
So roll on, buddy, roll onStepped off the plane down in Cabo
Just meaning to stay for a week
I got a funny sensation about this vacation
The second the sand hit my feet
Taxi driver took my two bags
He saw me looking at my watch
He said, you won't need that here cause time disappears
In paradise there ain't no clocks
You got a lot to learn about livin'
It's a different world down here
Our biggest problem's decidin' what fish
We're fryin'
Does it go with tequila or beer
He dropped me off at the hotel
I took a u-turn into the bar
I sat down on a stool out by the pool
Next to a lady smoking a Cuban cigar
I ordered a drink and took out my cell phone
I tried to make a call to L.A.
Dang thing wouldn't work, I started to curse
Bartender said, I bet it can wait
You got a lot to learn about livin'
It's a different world down here
Our biggest problem's decidin' what fish
We're fryin'
Does it go with tequila or beer
I, yi, yi, change is in the air
Now, I, yi, yi, ain't got a care
Six months later, I'm driving a taxi
I got a Hawaiian shirt and a tan
Pick up some guy in a Brooks Brothers tie
I say, it's time to loosen up man
You got a lot to learn about livin'
It's a different world down here
Our biggest problem's decidin' what fish
We're fryin'
Does it go with tequila or beer
There's a lot to learn about livin'
It's a different life down here
Our biggest problem's decidin' what fish
We're fryin'
Does it go with tequila or beerWhen God dips his pen of love in my heart
And writes my soul a message he wants me to know
His spirit all divine fills this sinful soul of mine when God dips his love in my heart
Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a living soul
How he brought salvation when he made me whole
But I found I couldn't hide such love as Jesus did impart
Well it makes me laugh it makes me cry sets my sinful soul on fire
When God dips his love in my heart
Sometimes though the way is dreary dark and cold
And some unburdened sorrow keeps me from the goal
I go to God in prayer I can always find him there to whisper sweet peace to my soul
Well I said I wouldn't tell it...
He walked every step up calvary's ragged way
To give his life completely and bring a better day
My life was steeped and sinned but in love he took me in
His blood washed away every stain
Well I said I wouldn't tell it...
When God dips his love in my heartAt the end of the day my heart's filled with despair
I knelt by my bed for a moment of prayer
I asked God to help me and show me the way
Then out of the darkness a voice seemed to say
Follow me and your sins will be washed snowy white
Follow me to the streets that are paved with pure gold
Follow me and your darkness would turn into light
You'll see riches and treasures untold
[ steel ]
I was lost in a world filled with doubt and the shame
Each day brought me tears that I'd fall by the way
Then out of the rocks and the caverns they came
A voice that somehow seemed to say
Follow me and your load will be lighter to bear
Follow and your heart will be free from all care
Follow me and I'll make you a place with him there if you would just follow meSend me the pillow that you dream on.
Don't you know that I still care for you?
Send me the pillow that you dream on,
So darling, I can dream on it, too.
Each night while I'm sleeping oh, so lonely,
I'll share your love in dreams that once were true.
Send me the pillow that you dream on,
So darling, I can dream on it, too.
I've waited so long for you to write me,
But just a memory's all that's left of you.
Send me the pillow that you dream on,
So darling, I can dream on it, too.
So darling, I can dream on it, too.Verse one
Sages have come from far following one bright star
Telling us where thou art from heaven
The king of kings, lord is the word he brings
Praise of the nazarene the angels will sing
Chorus
Jesus born unto mary in bethlehem
The angels herald the pietas in the magi,
Ardent wouldn't tarry to find him,
Enshrine him, glorify him
Verse two
Frankincense, gold and myrrh honor the savior's birth
The highest praise on earth
The angels will sing of him, the trinity begins
Voices will ring,	"amen the birth of the king"
Chorus two
Jesus, joseph and mary of israel, isiah's
Miracle augured befell
The coming of christ as the star from the east will tell
The first noel our load emmanuel
Verse three
Sages have come from far following one bright star
Telling us who thou art from heaven
The king of kings, lord is the word he brings
Praise of the nazarene, the angels will sing
Of the birth of the king
The angels will sing of the birth of the king
The angels will sing of the birth of the kingI wish I could unlock the door that leads to yesterday
Back to when our love was young and we had things our way
I'll never love that much again if I live a hundred times
Back when there was you and love and I
You and love and I
I could never find another one to take your place
All the love in this old world could never fill the space
I'll spend my forevers dreaming of those tender times
Back when there was you and love and I
You and love and I
Sometimes I still find myself making plans for two
Then I realize how many things I didn't do
There's a million things I'd change if I just had the time
Back when there was you and love and I
You and love and I
I could never find another one to take your place
I wish I could unlock the door that leads to yesterdayEvery night it's the same
I feel your heart turn cold as rain
And know that you'll be gone again
I hear the front door close
You say you got to go downtown
I guess there's someone else you've found
So why you're still coming round
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die
That's the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees
How love's made a fool of me
I guess that's how it's meant to be but
Heaven only knows
I've heard it said that talk is cheap
But still your words they cut so deep
Lay me crying in my sleep
And the pain just grows
I don't know who's right or wrong
But all we had is dead and gone
So why you keep me hanging on
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die
That's the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees
How love's made a fool of me
I guess that's how it's meant to be but
Heaven only knows
I'm going to turn and walk away
There's nothing left for me to say
It wouldn't change things anyway
Though, I suppose
The love I gave was always true
Well, I don't know what else to do
And how I'll ever get over you
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die
That's the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees
How love's made a fool of me
I guess that's how it's meant to be but
Heaven only knowsImagine a dirt road full of pot holes
With a creek bank and some cane poles
Catching channel cat
I'm a little more country than that
Picture a small town with an old hound
Laying out front of the court house
While the old men chew the fat
I'm a little more country than that
I just want to make sure you know just who you're getting under, this old hat
Cause girl I'm not the kind of two time or play games behind your back
I'm a little more country than that
Think of a hank song from days gone
With a steel ride that's so strong
It sends chills up your back
I'm a little more country than that
If you want a brick home in a school zone
With the doors locked and alarms on
Girl, you're way off track
I'm a little more country than that
I just want to make sure you know just who you're getting under this old hat
Cause girl I'm not the kind of two time or play games behind your back
I'm a little more country than that
Yeah, I'm sure that you've heard those three words from others
But they fell flat
But this ring ain't something that I mean to give you
And then take back
I'm a little more country than that
I'm a little more country than that
I'm a little more country than thatWhat makes two hearts that beat as one
Until the heart trades love for fun?
What makes the one I love untrue?
What makes me love you like I do?
What makes the stars up in the sky
Seem lost from dark clouds drifting by?
What makes them tear my dreams in two?
What makes me love you like I do?
What makes a heart so sick and sore?
What makes a heart keep yearning for
A heart that's gone to love anew?
What makes me love you like I do?
I can't explain this heart of mine
This foolish love it made was blind
I'd ended all if I just knew
What makes me love you like I do?May the good Lord bless and keep you whether near or far away
May you find that long awaited golden day today
May your troubles all be small ones and your fortune ten times ten
May the good Lord bless and keep you till we meet again
May you walk with sunlight shining and a bluebird in every tree
May there be a silver lining back of every cloud you see
Fill your dreams with sweet tomorrows never mind what might have been
May the good Lord bless and keep you till we meet again
(Fill your dreams with sweet tomorrows never mind what might have been)
May the good Lord bless and keep you till we meet again
May the good Lord bless and keep you till we meet till we meet againWhen years seem like days to me
No time on my hands
I run away to a place in me
To a faraway land
When home seems so far from me
Heaven's lights look dim
It's just as far as my deepest heart
Where my heart's Father lives
His quiet voice speaking in silence everyday
If I will only listen to the words He has to say
I'll walk in His Spirit, see Him in my face
I will live, 'cause He will live in my place
When life seems so hard to bear
When shadows look real
The circumstance is your Father's care
Go by faith not what you feel
If you have been running too
Stop now in your tracks
Turn again to the one in you
Put your burden on His back
His quiet voice speaking in silence everyday
If I will only listen to the words He has to say
I'll walk in His Spirit, see Him in your face
I will live, 'cause He will live in my place
When years seem like days to me
No time on my hands
I run away to a place in me
To a faraway landNow the hacienda's dark, the town is sleeping,
Now the time has come to part, the time for weeping,
Vaya Con Dios, my darling,
May God be with you, my love.
Now the village mission bells are softly ringing,
If you listen with your heart, you'll hear them singing.
Now the time has come to part, the time for weeping,
Vaya Con Dios, my darling,
May God be with you, my love.
Wherever you may be, I'll be beside you,
Although you're many million dreams away.
Each night I 'll say a pray'r, a pray'r to guide you,
To hasten every lonely hour of ev'ry lonely day.
Now the dawn is breaking through a gray tomorrow,
But the memories we share are there to borrow.
Vaya Con Dios, my darling,
May God be with you, my love.Pinch me I must be dreaming waking up with you and feeling
The tender touch of your good morning kiss
No where else on earth is better than being next to you
Next to heaven, it doesnt get any better than this
(Chorus)
Next to heaven lies my fate, my best friend and my sole mate
God knows this kind of love only comes from up above
Youre the answer to my prayers, nothing else compare
Im next to heaven when I am next to you
You look just like an angel tangled in white satin sheets
Lying there with your hair all in a mess
I swear you look your best all dressed up next to nothing
Next to heaven, it doesnt get any better than this
Chorus (x3)Let's close the door and pull the shades
And listen to the winter rain grow quiet as it's turning into snow
Share a cigarette and take it easy take it slow
Let's pull out some records that we haven't played in much too long
The misty moods would sure sound good again
I almost forgot how much I love you let's make it the best it's ever been
Throw another log on the fire don't let the flame die again
I know we could make it it's ours so let's take it
Let's make it the best it's ever been let's make it the best it's ever been
We haven't been as close to one another as we used to be
Instead of making love we make believe
Unless we work at keepin' love from leaving it's gonna leave
But I'll go back to working at it if you'll help me do it
We found it once I know we can again
Come down on the floor and lie beside me let's make it the best it's ever been
Throw another log on the fire...Lucky one

They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of a many poor boy
And me, oh God, for one
Then fill the glasses to the brim
Let the drinks go merrily around
And we'll drink to the health of a rounder poor boy
Who goes from town to town
The only thing that a rounder needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk
Now boys, don't believe what a girl tells you
Though her eyes be blue or brown
Unless she's on some scaffold high
Saying, "Boys, I can't come down"
Go tell my youngest brother
Not to do the things I've done
But to shun that house down in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
I'm going back, back to New Orleans
For my race is nearly run
Gonna spend the rest of my wicked life
Beneath that Rising SunBaby mine, don't you cry
Baby mine, dry your eyes
Rest your head close to my heart
Never to part
Baby of mine
Little one, when you play
Don't you mind what they say
Let those eyes sparkle and shine
Never a tear
Baby of mine
If they knew sweet little you
They'd end up loving you too
All of those people who scold you
What they'd give just for the right to hold you
From your head, down to your toes
You're not much, goodness knows
But you're so precious to me
Sweet as can be
Baby of mine
If they knew sweet little you
They'd end up loving you too
All those same people who scold you
What they'd give just for the right to hold you
From your head, down to your toes
You're not much, goodness knows
But you're so precious to me
Sweet as can be
Baby of mine
Baby of mineSomeday soon I'm gonna find myself a savior
Sit him on a Naugahyde
Make him tell me the answers
Someday soon
He'll look at me
With the word in his eyes
He'll notice the hero to come
Someday soon, someday soon
Someday soon I'm gonna find myself a leader
Someone who can take me
By the hand towards safety
Someday soon
With only a wink
He'll tell me all I need know
His personal call will come
Someday soon, someday soon
Find myself another heart to carry this weight
Find another path to take
Find myself another heart to carry this weight
Find another path to take
Someday soon, someday soon
Someday soon I'm gonna find myself a banner
March when they tell me to
Cheer when it matters
Someday soon
Let's take our place at the back of the bus
Erase all the lies we've been told
Shoulder the load of those that are dear
And look to the days to come
Someday soon, someday soon
Someday soon, someday soon
Someday soon, someday soonCover band on a Flora-Bama deck
A thousand sun-burned souls
Rum-runners and cold Bud Light
A little Friday night summertime rock and roll
Packed in tight, they were singin' along
I was hanging on the edge of the crowd
When you spilled your beer down the back of my shirt
You had me when I turned around
Guitars on the gulf breeze
Smoke rings 'round the neon
Moonlight in your blue eyes
'Neath that Georgia hat that you had on
Just one night to hold you
No, that ain't what I call fair
But the memories burn in my mind
Like those lighters in the air
Lighters in the air
That one look led to a walk on the beach
And more kisses than I could count
The best kind of wild and down-home smile
I've ever had these arms around
The amps were screamin' and the people were too
While we were slow dancing in our bare feet
Ain't it funny how we missed it all
And still didn't miss a thing?
Guitars on the gulf breeze
Smoke rings 'round the neon
Moonlight in your blue eyes
'Neath that Georgia hat that you had on
Just one night to hold you
No, that ain't what I call fair
But the memories burn in my mind
Like those lighters in the air
The thought of you won't let me go
It's been holding on for years
It don't take much to take me back
Every time I hear
Guitars on the gulf breeze
Smoke rings 'round the neon
Moonlight in your blue eyes
'Neath that Georgia hat that you had on
Just one night to hold you
No, that ain't what I call fair
But the memories burn in my mind
Like those lighters in the air
Raise your lighters in the airBaby since you've been gone
I leave the TV on
Gotta here somebody's voice
I just need some kind of noise
I lay some pillows down
To wrap my arms around
I pretend I'm holding you
I know it's sad, but it's what I do
To keep me from going crazy
I can get up and face today
Just as fine all by myself
Go out and take on this world
And get it done, get it done like nobody else
Oh but I don't do lonely well
I got some real good friends
Check on me now and then
Say I need to get a life
Say I need to get out at night
It's easy to say alright
You're not the one going crazy
I can get up and face today
Just as fine all by myself
Go out and take on this world
And get it done, get it done like nobody else
Oh but I don't do lonely well
Here comes another sunset
Here comes another long night
I'm not over you yet
I'm not over you yet
I can get up and face today
Just as fine all by myself
Go out and take on this big old world
And get it done, get it done like nobody else
Oh I can get up and face today
Just as fine all by myself
Go out and take on this big old world
And get it done, get it done like nobody else
Oh but I don't do lonely well
I don't do lonely wellIf I had my way forever there'd be a garden of roses for you and for me
A million and one things dear I would do just for you just for you
And if I had my way we'd never grow old sunshine I'd bring you every day
You'd reign all alone like a queen on a throne if I had my way
(If I had my way forever there'd be a garden of roses for you and for me
A million and one things I would do) just for you just for you
And if I had my way we'd never grow old...
If I had my waySaw your picture in the paper and I see you've married good
And I know that he can give you all the things I never could
But I know that he won't give you what you need most of all
Well the door is always open and the light's on in the hall
Yes the door is always open and the light's on in the hall
And you know that I'll be waiting if you'd ever come to call
[ steel ]
And when night falls on that mansion and you're lying in his bed
When he begs for your attention will you think of me instead
And when he reaches out to touch you is your face turned to the wall
Yes the door is always open and the light's on in the hall
Yes the door is always open and the light's on in the hall
And you know that I'll be waiting if you'd ever come to call
And you know that I'll be waiting if you'd ever come to callIf we go should live hill forever I'll be there beside you while we do
I don't know how long we have to gather I just know I'm never leaving you
No matter where the road will be leading or what kind are things we running to
Just as long as my heart keeps on beating darling I am never leaving you
We won't think about the bridges that we're burning
Hand in hand we'll cross the ones we're coming through
For as long as this world keeps on turning darling I am never leaving you
No darling I am never leaving youThe only time I feel the pain
Is in the sunshine or the rain
And I don't feel no hurt at all
Unless you count when teardrops fall
I tell the truth 'cept when I lie
And it only hurts me when I cry
You couldn't tell it by this smile
But my recovery took a while
I worked for days and nights on end
Just to walk and talk again
You can't believe the time it takes
To heal a heart once it breaks
The only time I feel the pain
Is in the sunshine or the rain
And I don't feel no hurt at all
Unless you count when teardrops fall
I tell the truth 'cept when I lie
And it only hurts me when I cry
Oh maybe every now and then
I have a small heartache again
You wouldn't know to look at me
There's tiny scars that you can't see
It was a struggle to survive
I'm probably lucky I'm alive
The only time I feel the pain
Is in the sunshine or the rain
And I don't feel no hurt at all
Unless you count when teardrops fall
I tell the truth 'cept when I lie
And it only hurts me when I cry
I tell the truth 'cept when I lie
And it only hurts me when I cryNow, I'll tell ya a tale that'll bust yer heart
That only a few people knew, ta start
It all took place when our concert tour was booked at the SeaTac Hilton?
I'll guarantee ev'ry word's the Gospel truth
Got witnesses ta prove it, too,
'Cause we all toured with a fella by the name a' Milton
Now Milton was o-fficial tour director,
Electrical piano-playin' plug connector
An' the slave-drivin'-est travel conductor
That we ever seen in our lives
He'd say "Whaddya mean, ya need more rest?
"The world don't care whether ya look yer best!
"Simply show up promptly at six A.M. with your instruments ...and your wives!"
[Choir; in sorta of "Bringing In The Sheaves" way]
Shall we gather at the airport?
He'd always arrive in the nick a' time
A good five minutes ahead a' flight time
A-lookin' like he'd been drug through a needle's eye
He'd stand there, stoned and about ta choke
On his Egg McMuffin an' his giant Coke
An' then he'd throw all the tickets on the counter and say
"Check the bags and let's fly!"
"Well, whaddya mean, this is too much weight?
"We only got forty-six pieces a' freight!
"And if it don't go, who's gonna explain it to our fan club in Tacoma?"
We'd all get embarassed an' head for the plane
While Milton stood there, bein' profane
But somehow he always managed ta get on board ...in sort of a coma
[Choir]
When the drinks were served up yonder...
Well, we deplaned at th' other end
All the trouble seemed to commence again
Though Milton had ordered three station wagons, a pickup truck and a limo
And though he'd phoned ahead to that Number Two
Cussin' an' fussin' an' turnin' blue
We'd always end up with two Datsoons and a Pinto
Now Milton took all a' that stuff in stride
Laid on the floor, an' kicked an' cried
But we always looked up to him for hope and salvation
But we'd sink to the bottom a' trav'lers hell
When he'd check us in a remote motel
And he'd grab the clerk by his shirt an' tie an' say
"Whaddya mean, ¿no reservacines?"
[Choir]
Milton's getting bolder...
He'd shut himself in room one-oh-four
Let nobody in 'til he swept the floor
Adjusted the lampshade, aligned the TV, fixed the faucet, called the promoter
"Well, whaddya mean we're the warmup show?
"You're puttin' me on! We're stars, ya know!
"And this ain't the way we was treated last summer at Six Flags Over Dakota!
"Now we gotta have a hunnert percent top billing,
"Two-thirds in advance, a' course, you silly!
"I'm sure we prefer a chauffered limosine and two air-conditioned dressing rooms, please.
"I'm what? Well, so's your wife! She's not? Well, to each his own.
"Beg pardon, stick it in my what? Well, really, Merle who?"
[Choir]
William Morris, keep us working...
Now, Milton was a real good friend a' mine
An' we'd stuck together on down that line
But there was one or two points over which we just had to dee-bate
Like takin'-your-clothes-off-an'-hangin'-from-a-cross-in-front-a'-the-Tri-County-Fairgrounds
Is not necessarily an assurance that the crowd ain't gonna start throwin' tomatas
An' when ya arrive at four for a five o'clock show
An' the stage ain't built an' there's no electricity
About all ya could do is sit on yer butt an' cut bait
However, you give ol' Milton four strong bodies, a nine-foot grand, a beer and a cigarette
An' you just knew that show was gonna be ...outta state
[Choir]
Bringing in the bread
Bringing in the bread...
Now one night up there in Washington
We didn't get paid for a show we'd done
An' poor ol' Milton couldn't live with that; his brain just shorted out.
Well, he locked himself in the bathroom
An' then when he didn't come out for an hour an' a half
We figgered that somethin' was wrong, but we had to remove all doubt
We stood transfixed in shock and horror
When we busted down that there bathroom door
And I hope I never see a sight like that again; no, I don't
There was nothin' to do but close our eyes, an' bow our heads, an' vocalize
With a silent five-part acapella hymn, for him
[Choir]
What a friend we had in Milton...
Now we're gettin' ready, come next December
To put another concert tour together
And I'm sad to say ol' Milton ain't a-gonna be with us
No, it ain't gonna be exactly the same
When they introduce us without his name
So Milton, wherever you are, we hope you miss us!
See, Milton has moved on down the road
Over the rainbow, lookin' for gold
Yeah, he's up there where the stage lights is always on
But we can't forget that curly hair
When last we saw him a-settin' there
Holdin' his tambourine, suckin' his thumb, an' sound asleep on the johnWeather man says it's rainin' again
Perfect night for stayin' in
Lookin' at you I don't doubt that it's true
And did I hear you say
Baby put on a smile
Kick your shoes off
And stay a while
Well since you asked me to
I don't mind if I do
That ol' clock can just tick off the wall
I ain't worried 'bout the time at all
Long as I'm makin' time with you
And holdin' you tight
Dim light
Opry radio
I'll whisper baby I love you so
And since you want me to
I don't mind if I do
That ol' clock can just tick off the wall
I ain't worried 'bout the time at all
Long as I'm makin' time with you
And holdin' you tight
Dim light
Opry radio
I'll whisper baby I love you so
And since you want me to
I don't mind if I do
Just as long as it's you baby
I don't mind if I doWe work in the factories and the fields
Assembly lines and coal mines and the steel mills
That's what we do but there's more to us than that
If you want to know who we are it's on the logos of our caps
We're Mountaineers, volunteers
We're the tide that rolls, we're Seminoles
We're a herd of Longhorn steers
We drive Ford and Chevrolet
Shoot twenty-four and eighty-eight
We crank up our music Friday nights
On two thousand country stations
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's right
We might fix your water pump, your AC
Bring your apple pie, and fill your glass of tea
Take that Fedex package to your door
But underneath that apron or that uniform
We're Wild Cats, Wolverines
We're Tigers, Buckeyes, Bruins
Bulldogs, Hogs, and Hurricanes
We pray before we race
Cheer fourteen and forty-eight
We drink ice-cold beer on Friday nights
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's right
We're all across the map
Down city streets and old dirt roads
We're the fabric of this nation
And we're a nation all our own
We're Mountaineers, we're volunteers
We're Devils, Heels, and Rebels
Fighting Irish and Cavaliers
We soup up our Chevrolets
Cheer twenty-four and eighty-eight
And we crank up the same songs Friday night
On two thousand country stations
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's rightMorning's come and Lord my mind is aching
That old sunshine stands silent at my door
But just like the dawn my heart is silently breaking
As my tears go tumbling to the floor
Once again the whole town will be talking
Yes Lord I've seen the pity in their eyes
Cause they'll never understand it's her sorrow and not a man
Ah but no matter what they say I know she tried
Yes baby's packed her soft things and left me
But I just know she didn't mean to be unkind
No it's not her heart Lord it's her mind she didn't mean to be unkind
Why she even woke me up to say goodbye
Yes baby's packed her soft things and left me...
Yes she even woke me up to say goodbyeWell, everybody talks about the California quakes
But the first time I ever felt the earth shake was in Miami
When Amy touched me, aww, it shook me
I told her I loved her and I wanted to stay
But she said, "Be sure and I'll call you in L.A."
Even in the taxi I could hear my telephone ring
Calling me from Miami, my Amy
What took you so long, I thought you'd never call?
Miami, oh, my Amy
Miami, my Amy loves me after all
Now Amy just called and said, "Please come back"
I said, "I'm on my way, babe, I ain't even unpacked"
"I want you, I love you", that's all she had to say, goodbye L.A.
Now once again I'm Miami bound
Can't wait 'til this plane touches down
'Cause I know my Amy will be waiting at that Miami gate
I can't wait, Miami, my Amy
What took you so long I thought you'd never call?
Miami, oh, my Amy
Miami, my Amy loves me after all
Oh, Miami, my Amy loves me after allScarce (Chris Jonat)
Love is a strange apparatus, a game
with rules that drift like the snow
You want to be heard, hell you want to be served
But you can't figure which way to go
Cause in love or not there's some things you forgot
Like love wasn't built in a day
Or a month or a year, yeah if love is here
It just happened by this way
Look up, look down
Love's been here before and it's coming back round
Back up, crouch down
Gotta make yourself scarce if you want to be found
I know what it means, why you need to be seen
I know that there's pride on the line
But you can't always take, always be on the make
Relax and you'll be doing fineTake the jib sail down boys, take the jib sail down
Turn this ship around boys, before we run aground
The fish aren't biting today boys, fish aren't biting today
I'm gonna lay on my bunk and get drunk as a skunk
?Cause the fish aren't biting today
There's six foot waves and my stomach craves
Some good old Antiguan rum
I put some away for a rainy day
And the rain she's starting to come now
There's a northern wind and the lights are dim
Like a good fresh Cuban cigar
I got me a hutch where there might be a bunch
In the Captions pickle jar, soWhen God paints, birds sing
He colors every feather on a sparrow's wings
When God paints, the wind blows
With a stroke of love, he dips his brush in a rainbow
Sometimes I take for granted the simple things
I can be his biggest critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain
When God paints, the heart beats
Life begins, a season ends and lovers meet
And I've learned that sometimes
It's not always black and white or well-defined
When God paints
Sometimes I take for granted the simple things
I can be his biggest critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain
When God paints, we dance
And I reach across the canvas and I take your hand
And my world is so complete
When I look at you, a masterpiece is all I see
When God paints
Sometimes I take for granted the simple things
I can be his big as critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain
When God paints
I pray I always see the beauty inside the frame
When God paintsWhen I was born
My Daddy said I was broken
The beginning of the end
Of a life I hadn't chosen
He taught me how to give up
He taught me how to work the system
But I never had the time
I never had the luxury
Life's hard, I've always known that
I've never been handed no welcome mat
When I die, please don't cry
'Cause heaven's my home anyhow
Shining my shoes
Seems like time for wasting
'Cause this bright sun
Is the only shine I need
They say you only live once
And the lot you get's for keeping
But glory's gonna come
And make a new man out of me
Life's hard, I've always known that
I've never been handed no welcome mat
When I die, please don't cry
'Cause heaven's my home anyhow
When I was born
My face was like the angels
I took my father by the hand
He said life won't be hard now
No, life's hard, I've always known that
I've never been handed no welcome mat
When I die, please don't cry
'Cause heaven's my home anyhow
Life's hard, I've always known that
I've never been handed no welcome mat
When I die, please don't cry
'Cause heaven's my home anyhow
When I die
When I die
When I die
Please don't cry
Life's hard, I've always known that
I've never been handed no welcome mat
When I die, please don't cry
'Cause heaven's my homeShe was born one mornin' on a Sun Juan summer back in 18-an'-80-an'-1
She was a beautiful daughter of the D & RG and she weighed about a thousand ton
Well it's a 45 mile thru the Animas Canyon so they set her on the narrow-guage
She drunk a whole lotta water and she ate a lotta coal
And they called her the Silverton (Silverton Train)
(Here comes the Silverton up from Durango
Here come the Silverton a shovelin' coal
Here comes the Silverton up from the canyon
See the smoke and hear the whistle blow)
Well now listen to the whistle in the rockwood cut on the high line to Silverton Town
And you're gonna get a shiver when you check out the river
Which is four hundred feet straight down
Take on some water and the Needleton tank and then I struggle up a two-five grade
And by the time you get your hide past the snowshed slide
You've had a ride on the Silverton (Silverton Train)
(Here comes the Silverton...

(Here comes the Silverton...
Now down by the station early in the mornin' there's a whole lotta people in line
And they all got a ticket on the train to yesterday and it's a gonna leave on time
Well it's a 45 mile thru the Animas Canyon so they set her on the narrow-guage
She takes a whole lotta water and she ate a lotta coal
And they called her the Silverton (Silverton Train)

Lines you're writing out
That's the way you
Know me anyhow
But the lines stretch out
To where you are now
Can you hear my heart
Can you understand
Are these letters only
Falling from my hand
Can our hearts decode
All the text implies
Can I look into your
Hardened old eyes
Set the cards up
Watch the dominos fall
You don't even
Know me hardly at all
And the chances are
Incredibly small
Can you hear my heart
Can you understand
Are these letters only
Falling from my hand
Can our hearts decode
All the text implies
Can I look into your
Hardened old eyesCity girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man and she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style
Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice
So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feeling down
But he knows where she's going as she's leaving
She's headed for the cheatin' side of town
You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile has been disguised
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
On the other side of town a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipating
'Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel
She rushes to his arms, they fall together
She whispers that it's only for a while
She swears that soon she'll be coming back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile
She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry
She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
She's so far gone she feels just like a fool
My oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things?
You're still the same old girl you used to be
You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile has been disguised
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyesOh blue is my life by day by night nobody cares if I live or die
Is a man not a man when he ends it all when he take his own before hearing the call
If a coward I'd be to yield to misery no mercy will I ask when I sip from the cask
I've been titled at last undesired
Can't death be as bad as the heartaches I've had will the death take away all the pain
All the pain from one undesired
My lover's so fair as seas not do care my heart if full of grief and despair
Chance I fancy has rubbed me of lust she remain but I know or I feel that I must
If a coward I'd be to yield to misery
Undesired undesired(C.W. McCall, Bill Fries, Chip Davis)
Ev'ry evenin', when the sun goes down
And nobody can see me
I get my Chevy an' I cruise around
Makin' love on my CB
I say, "Breaker broker for the Wolfman, baby
We lookin' for Red Ridin' Hoods
We definitely wants to modulate
We on the side, in the woods"
[Chorus]
Two-way lovin'
That's all I want to doo-woo-woo
Two-way lovin'
That's all I ever want to doo-oo-oo-oo-oo
An' she say "My, what a big pair of ears you have."
[Chorus]
Mama wants an eighty-eight
Now the other evenin' I was all alone
Wasn't nothin' to do
I called my baby on my microphone
Says, "Hello, where is you?"
She said her twenty was a-Grandma's place
(Which is down in the woods)
I ask her do she want to modulate?
Like a good Hood should
[Chorus]
Love me baby, hold me tight
Kiss me with your little mike
Don't you turn your squelch on me
Two-way lovin'
That's all I ever want to doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo
Doo-doo?
She say, "My, what a big 10-4 you have, baby"
[Chorus]
Mama hold your mike up tight
Daddy treat your beaver right
Gonna modulate all nightYou had a Corona and I was drinking Bud Light
That jukebox singing every song just right that night
Something brewing in the air and it was more than just smoke
Looking back, looking back after two you laughed at all my jokes
Tonight lets raise 'em up to where we ended up
There's been highs and lows, fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven, lost it all and we rolled some sevens
Been some smiles then there's been tears, been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy baby how we got here, oh, it all started with a beer
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer
I didn't have much money but I covered them rounds
'Cause a pretty girl like you makes a fella throw his money down
You weren't shooting no whiskey, just shootin' the shit
I paid the tab we walked out the door, I remember thinking this was it
Yeah you were it
There's been highs and lows, fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven, lost it all and we rolled some sevens
There's been some smiles then there's been tears, been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy baby how we got here, oh, it all started with a beer (Yeah)
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer
Here's to you baby (oh oh oh)
So tonight lets raise 'em up to where we ended up
'Cause there's been highs and lows, fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven, lost it all and we rolled some sevens
There's been some smiles then there's been tears, been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy baby how we got here, oh, it all started with a beer (oh)
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer (oh) (yeah)

Well I wish you could have seen us
One car between us
Too far gone so someone had to go
She called her mama
And I called her a friend
But we couldn't get a hold of either one of them
As luck would have it
She had a habit
Of winning every fight that we get in
So she fired the ignition
but she kept bitchin
until the minute that we pulled in
She was good enough to drive me to drinkin
And drop me off at the bar
She pulled away in our eighty-three Lincoln
And I ain't seen her no more
But at least she knew where my heart was at
For years I never found hers
I drove her to the brink an'
She drove me to drinkin'My heart is out of control
This ole love struck soul
Just lives for the moment you're around
When I hold on to you
It is all I can do
Just to keep my feet on the ground
Desperately loving you desperately
When you're not here with me
I get a little bit crazy
Constantly I think about you constantly
Look at what you've done to me
I'm just like a little baby
Oh I love you desperately
Will I laugh will I cry
Will I live will I die
It all depends upon you
And it is dangerous I know
To be lost in you so
But I am and there's nothing I can do
Desperately loving you desperately
When you're not here with me
I get a little bit crazy
Constantly I think about you constantly
Look at what you've done to me
I'm just like a little baby
Oh I love you desperately
Desperately loving you desperately
When you're not here with me
I get a little bit crazy
Constantly I think about you constantly
Look at what you've done to me
I'm just like a little baby
Oh I love you desperatelyI never had a pair of shoes that weren't all hand-me-downs
And daddy's morning coffee came from ol' left over ground
My mama wore no jewelry or any store bought stuff
And home was on a hillside forty miles from Poplar Bluff
[Chorus:]
Forty miles back in Missouri there's a different way of life
Where a man thinks of his neighbor and not his neighbor's wife
Life is far from fancy sometimes mighty rough
But contentment makes it worth it forty miles from Poplar Bluff
Our only family treasure was a beat up radio
But it took us to the places where we knew we'd never go
We never had much money but we always had enough
'Cause money never mattered much forty miles from Poplar Bluff
[Chorus:]
Well nearly every winter when the snow is on the ground
And the roads would all be closed and we couldn't get to town
But if daddy had his tobacco, grandma had her snuff
Then the winters didn't seem so long forty miles from Poplar BluffWriters: Doug Supernaw, Tammy Pierce
I've had one too many, as if you couldn't tell
And I called you from the bottom of my sinking spell
I know we agreed that it'd be eaiser on me not to talk to you
Or see you until I get over you
But my heart has left me no choice
So excuse me, but I've just gotta hear your voice
'cause I'm having one of those days
When your memory won't go away
Tomorrow I'll be okay
But I'm just having one, one of those days
I'm getting by one day at a time
It's not nearly as often that you cross my mind
But early this morning felt it coming over me
Tried to fight it back, can't hold it back
Can't help it that this call's in vain
Ah but it's not a storm you know it's just a little rain
I'm just having one of those days
When your memory won't go away
Tomorrow I'll be okay
But I'm just having one, one of those days
Yes I'm just having one, one of those daysYeah I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you oh yeah
I'm gonna start with the halls take the pictures off the walls and break 'em
Move the chairs around take the window curtains down and burn 'em
Everything I see reminds me you were here
Yeah I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you oh yeah
The candle of your set you gave me on the night of my birthday
The records that you bought the hi-fi we loved to play
The decorating man will come and rearrange them
Yeah I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you oh yeah
Take the carpet off the floor throw it out the door it's filled with tears
Everything I find that brings you to my mind must disappear
Every night I dream I'll dream of someone new
Yeah I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you
Yeah I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of you
Yeah I'm gonna change everything that holds a mem'ry of youLay your head on your pillow now
Close your eyes
I'll tuck you in and I'll kiss you goodnight
While you and your teddy bear are countin' sheep
Next thing you know, you'll be fast asleep
Sleep now my angle your long day is done
The very best part of the night has begun
Cause we get a present when we go to sleep
We get to dream
If you have a dream your dream can come true
A whole world of wonder is waiting for you
Life's an adventure there's so much to do
If you have a dream your dream can come true
You can go walkin' on peppermint clouds
And see yourself being' a real circus clown
Sail on a river of strawberry cream
Be a star or an astronaut, follow your dream
A whole world of wonder is waiting for you
Life's an adventure there's so much to do

ShineIf it was up to the boss, I think he'd work you to death
We got bills to pay and we're up to our necks in debt
I went to pick up the truck, the radiator still leaks
Sometimes it feels like we're stuck with no paddle up a creek
Baby, when it's down to me and you
We leave our worries at the door
We got more important things to do
Baby, when it's down to me and you
We just make up for life's little problems
By makin' love the whole night through
Well, the price of groceries goes up every day
Seems like our hard-earned money just up and flies away
Sometimes it feels like we're backed in a corner up against the wall
But puttin' up with the hassles isn't really a hassle at all, 'cause
Baby, when it's down to me and you
We leave our worries at the door
We got more important things to do
Baby, when it's down to me and you
We just make up for life's little problems
By makin' love the whole night through
We'll lock the world outside
Oh, we've made up our minds
Love is all that matters tonight
Baby, when it's down to me and you
We leave our worries at the door
We got more important things to do
Baby, when it's down to me and you
We just make up for life's little problems
By makin' love the whole night throughSeeing your face in every child that smiles
But I can't help but rejoice
And I have heard the song called 'Thunder'
But I knew it was your voice
Touch the holes in your challis
And stuck my fingers in your side
But I was six feet deep in doubt but
And now I'm sure that you're alive
And it's sad to say but never know everything
Still blessings we've received
And it's sad to say I really don't know a thing
It's the lies you shouldn't believe
Smell the sand of angels sweet road
And in the summer air
I have pretend to keep the incense
While the saints send up their prayers
I have tasted and now I see though
I see that you are good
And I have ate your perfume body
I have drank your blessed blood
And it's sad to say but never know everything
Still blessings we've received
And it's sad to say I really don't know a thing
It's the lies you shouldn't believe
And all the cancers that I've piled
Only take me so far down the line
The tracks are always getting round
Yeah, to leap from the lions mouth
And it's sad to say I really don't know a thing
Still blessings we've received
Yeah, it's sad to say I really don't know a thing
It's the lies you shouldn't believeSometimes I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders
And it brings me to my knees
Sometimes, I feel as though the things I know I can't control
Somehow find a way to take control of me
At the point I can no longer fight it
The only way I can describe it
That feelin' when I'm feelin' all alone
I wanna run away, run away home
Sometimes, it gets so hard to find that silver linin'
When the clouds come rollin' in
A sky of blue turns to gray and there's no shelter from the rain
And it feels as though the storm will never end
That's when there's nothin' like a mother's arms
To break the fall and heal the scars
In those times when I feel lost and all alone
I wanna run away, run away home
Long enough to get my feet back on the ground
Where I can rest and catch my breath and lay my burdens down
Back where no one knows me except those few who love me only
For who I was, not what I am, where I can be myself again
Sometimes I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders
And it brings me to my knees
Sometimes, I feel as though the things I know I can't control
Somehow find a way to take control of me
At the point I can no longer fight it
The only way I can describe it
That feelin' when I'm feelin' all alone
I wanna run away, run away home
I wanna run away, run away homeby Utah Phillips
Is that the moon I see
Over there in the west?
Or just a headlight beam
C&O; express?
I know she's gone
Whatever I say
And it won't be long
'Til I make up my mind
And go away
Is that the sun coming up
On that eastern shore
Or just a coal fire glow
Behind the firebox door?
I know she's gone
Whatever I say
And it won't be long
'Til I make up my mind
And go away.
See that man? He can't hear the whistle
The damned old fool's caught out on the trestle
He can't go forward and he can't go back
The train kept a-rollin'
Brushed him off the track
Other winds may blow
And the storm will rise
Still I long to go
Where the fast mail flies
I know she's gone
Whatever I say
And it won't be long
'Til I make up my mind
And go away
See that man...Baby, what do you say when love comes down on you
Rainin' the blues on you
Like it's never gonna end on you
And all yourdreams like leaves in the gutter go floatin' by
No, baby, I don't know why all God's children cry
I'll miss your skin, as golden as your wheatfield hair
And where you go I hope you find out there
A better rain
The kind that comes in off the coast and paints the sky
And lets you know that God's alive
A better rain
That'll wash me from your eyes so you can smile again
And be all right again
In a better rain
Someday is gonna find you in a sweeter place
Long after time has erased
All the words like razor blades
You'll remember you and me before the flood
Once upon a time in love, a beautiful us
I can see you on some stretch of sand
Spinin' round in circles barefoot dancin' in
A better rain
That'll leave behind a rainbow in the sky
Lets you know that God's alive
A better rain
That'll wash me from your eyes so you can smile again
And be all right again
In a better rainStrap yourself in
Hang on for the ride
Dirts gonna fly
Grounds gonna shake tonight
You don't have to look far

They call home this fearless band of dirt track

She's all that any man could ever hope or pray for.
If I were king, I'd trade the crown,
For that strange, strange lady in town.
(Strange lady in town.)
Oh, heart of mine, you're in danger,
There's a strange lady in town.
Who is this heart-stealin' stranger?
Who is turnin' the town upside down.
Here hair is red as the settin' sun.
Her lips are ripe as the corn.
The lights that rise in her sea-green eyes,
Make a man kinda glad he was born.
Strange lady in town, strange lady in town.
She's all that any man could ever hope or pray for.
If I were king, I'd trade the crown,
For that strange, strange lady in town.
(Strange lady in town.)
Ain't got no ring for her finger,
And I can't buy her a gown.
But rain or shine, I'll still make her mine.
That strange, strange lady in town.
Strange lady in town, strange lady in town.
She's all that any man could ever hope or pray for.

Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeell.
You gotta dig a little deeper,
if that girl's a keeper,
Lose a little bit of your pride,
You gotta dig a little deeper,
if you wanna keep her,
Keep her satisfied.
You spend your life,
a runnin' around,
Out there on the road,
Leavin' your woman a settin' at home,
To shoulder all a the load.
You gotta dig a little deeper,
if that girl's a keeper,
Lose a little bit of your pride,
You gotta dig a little deeper,
if you wanna keep her,
Keep her satisfied.
(Instrumentals)
Well now love is just a game,
That everbody plays,
You're either gonna win or lose,
A winner walks away,
high as a kite,
With the loser left,
cryin' the blues.
You gotta dig a little deeper,
if that girl's a keeper,
Lose a little bit of your pride,
You gotta dig a little deeper,
if you wanna keep her,
Keep her satisfied.
(Instrumentals)
Weeeeeeeeeeell.
If you gotta good woman,
Who's a waitin' at home,
with dinner on the table at five,
You gotta tell her,
you appreciate her every day,
And you love her,
till the day that you die.
You gotta dig a little deeper,
if that girl's a keeper,
Lose a little bit of your pride,
You gotta dig a little deeper,
if you wanna keep her,
Keep her satisfied.
Dig a little deeper,
Dig a little deeper,
Dig a little deeper,
Dig a little deeper,
Dig a little deeper,
Dig,
You've got to,
Dig a little deeper,
If you wanna keep her,
Keep her satisfied.
Keep her satisfiiiiiiiiied.Sitting at a bar in New York City
Everybody here looking New York pretty
But you're the kinda girl that's got that something
Dancing to the groove like it just ain't nothing
They ain't never seen nothing quite like you
Long stem legs in your cowboy boots
Throwing back whiskey straight, no water
Girl there ain't nothing hotter
Chorus:
Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I'll take a sip of that smile
I'll bet the boys at home can't leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You're so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby, you're just so homegrown
Trying to think of something cool to say
Turned around and saw you walking my way
Pulled me on the floor saying, "Son it's on"
And we were dancing all night long
To a sweet old Alabama song
Repeat Chorus
Ooh baby, baby, baby
You're driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
I'm a long way away from where I'm from
But baby you feel like home
Repeat Chorus
You're so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby, you're just so homegrownExcept for you
I've never known what love is
Or how it feels, to have a dream come true
But now I find my world no longer lonely
And the way that it would be, except for you
One by one
You mended all the pieces
of a heart that someone broke in two
You filled my life with happiness and sunshine
That i never would have known
Except for you
You brought all the rainbow colours to a world of solid blues
And nothing prettier than rainbows, except for you
And so my love, I wanted just to tell you
This old heart wont beat again
This old heart wont beat again
This old heart wont beat again
Except youOh beautiful child,
You've got a garden of time waiting for you
There are fields full of wonder for you
to uncover out there
I wanna be here to watch you change and grow and fly
Your future is as open as a big blue sky
And who you are is something you've gotta find out for yourself
And your life belongs to just you and nobody else
live your dreams and follow your heart
You'll find out who you are
Oh, sweet angel child, your spirit's
as wild as a sallion
Your innocense is
like a blanket of fresh white snow
You'll make mistakes
but don't be afraid to take your chance
Just beleive in yourself and you'll make your own path
Who you are is something
you've gotta find out for yourself
And your life belongs to
Just you and nobody else
Life your dreams and follow your heart
You'll find out who you are
And I wish I could be the angel beside
you to guide you
And I wish I could show you the way
But I know I gotta let you go
And who you are is something
you gotta find out for yourself.
And your life belongs to
Just you and nobody else
Life your dreams and follow your heart
You'll find out who you areCumberland Gap is not my home
I'm gonna leave old Cumberland alone
Cumberland Gap is one devil of a place
Can't get the water for to wash your face
Lay down boys take your ease
Gonna have a battle with ticks and fleas
Me and my wife and my wife's pap
Run all day through that Cumberland Gap
Old aunt Dinah, if you don't care
I'll leave my demijohn sittin' right there
And if it's not there when I get back
I'll raise hell in the Cumberland GapHere comes more tears to cry here comes more heartaches by
Here comes my baby back again
Here comes more misery here come old memories
Here comes my baby back again
My arms are open wide to let more hurt inside
Here comes my baby back again
She's sorry once again once more I'll understand
Here comes my baby back again
Here comes my baby back againShe never knew my name, least not the one my daddy gave me
I took off the way I came, moonlight reflectin' off the road
She didn't want my story, so I didn't have to lie
If I loved her it was only for a night
[Chorus]
Livin' life on the run, you can't give your heart to no one
Your only friend is the settin' sun I, didn't do what they said I done, I gotta
Stay one step ahead or one of these days I'm gonna wake up dead
Dropped in my tracks by a bullet from a lawman's gun
Oh, you can't rest a minute when you're livin' life on the run
Here we go
The white lines on the road, that's the only trail I leave behind me
Been chasin' high-line poles, ever since the night I skipped out of town
Somewhere in the distance, is where I need to be
All I care about right now is speed
[Chorus]
Here they come now, gotta lay low
Done bent the law 'til the law got broke
Here they come now, gotta lay low
Low, low, low, low,
Here they come now, they're closin' in
Pack of bloodhounds gonna catch my scent
Here they come now, now gone again
Yeah
Livin' life on the run,
You can't give your heart to no one,
You can't rest a minute when you're livin' life on the run
No, you can't rest a minute when you're livin' life, on the runI met her a month ago, down at the boogie ranch
She came onto me in her red polyester pants
I've never had a woman so drop dead fine
It's hard to believe I ever made her mine
Well, she calls me baby 54 times a day
And all of my friends think that I've got it made
When other men stare, that's something she can't avoid
I'm so insecure, yeah, I'm so paranoid
[Chorus]
I'm just waiting, well, I'm just waiting
Well, I'm just waiting for her to break my heart
When we're alone together it's paradise
Victoria's Secret and cold champagne all nice
But for the second time this month it's happened again
She thanks me for roses that I didn't send
[Chorus]
The handwritings on the wall
Pretty soon the tears are gonna fall
Well, I'm just waiting, well, I'm just waiting
Well, I'm just waiting for her to break my heart
[Chorus]Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5
Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fat promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me!
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss-man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
You're in the same boat with a lotta your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
An' the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way
Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
9 to 5, whoa what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
9 to 5, working 9 to 5Go ahead and lead me on
Tell me you never do this
Take my keys and steal my kiss
Let the lies roll off your lips
You go ahead and lead me on
Tonight
A little bit of wrong could be alright
And when you're gone,
Hey what's some worst one more goodbye could do
You can't hurt me cause I can't love you
No need to skate around where this is going
You can't break what's broken
I don't wanna be alone
With all these jagged pieces
You can't unwreck the wreck she left
But we could rearrange the mess
And I don't wanna be alone
Tonight
A little bit of wrong could be alright
And when you're gone,
Hey what's some worst one more goodbye could do
You can't hurt me cause I can't love you
No need to skate around where this is going
You can't break what's broken
Hey what's some worst one more goodbye could do
You can't hurt me cause I can't love you
My heart's so far beyond repair
You don't have to handle me with care
No need to skate around where this is going
You can't break what's broken, broken
You can't break what's
So go ahead and lead me onI've been loving you too long to stop now
You are tired and you want to be free
My love is growin' stronger as you become a haven to me
I've been loving you a little too long I don't want to stop now
With you my life has been so wonderful I can't stop now
You are tired and your love is growin' colder
My love is growin' stronger as our affair grows older
I've been loving you too long I've been loving you oh too long
I've been loving you too long to stop nowPeople starin' at me as they wheel me down the ramp toward my plane
The war is over for me I've forgotten everything except the pain
Thank you sir and yes sir it was worth it for the old red-white-and-blue
And since I won't be walking I suppose I'll save some money buying shoes
The bottle hidden underneath the blanket over my two battered legs
I can see see the stewardess make over me and ask were you afraid
I say why no I'm Superman and couldn't find a phone booth quite in time
A G-I gets a lotta laughs if he remembers all the funny lines
Mama bake a pie daddy kill a chicken your son is comin' home 11:35 Wednesday night
Mama will be crying daddy's gonna say son did they treat you good
My uncle will be drunk and he'll say boy they do some real great things with wood
The letter that she wrote me said goodbye she couldn't wait and lots of luck
The bottle underneath the blanket feels just like an old friend to my touch
I know she'll come and see me but I bet she never once looks at my legs
She'll talk about the weather and the dress she wore the July 4th Parade
Lord I love her and I don't believe this bottle's gonna get her off my mind
I see here in the paper where they say the war is just a waste of time
Mama bake a pie daddy kill a chicken your son is comin' home 11:35 Wednesday nightDon't try to cry your way out of this
Don't try to lie or I'll catch you in it
Don't try to make me feel sorry for you
Just because I'm blond
Don't think I'm dumb
'Cause this dumb blond ain't nobody's fool
When you left you thought I'd sit
An' you thought I'd wait
An' you thought I'd cry
You called me a dumb blond
Ah, but somehow I lived through it
And you know if there's one thing this blond has learned
Blonds have more fun
You flew too high up off the ground
It's stormy weather an' had to come back down
But I've found a new thread for my old spool
Just because I'm blond
Don't think I'm dumb
'Cause this dumb blond ain't nobody's fool
When you left you thought I'd sit
An' you thought I'd wait
An' you thought I'd cry
You called me a dumb blond
Ah, but somehow I lived through it
And you know if there's one thing this blond has learned
Blonds have more funI want you to want me the way that I want you
And I need you to need me the way that I need you
They say that love's not put in your heart to stay
And love's not love till you give it away
No matter what tomorrow may bring true love is a lasting thing
[ piano ]
Love's not put in your heart to stay...
No matter what tomorrow may bring true love is a lasting thingGirl you're my sunshine
Chase away the raindrops
Make it all worthwhile
Make all the pain stop
Just like the river
Keep love flowin'
Don't let our world stop
Keep it goin'
I like it just the way you are
Honey don't change who you are
Don't change on me
Don't you change on me
Girl you're my lucky star
Honey don't change who you are
Don't change on me
Don't change on me
I used to wonder
Where would I find
Some kind of happiness
And peace of mind
Livin' in the darkness
Then you came
Bringin' sunlight
Easin' my pain
I love you just the way you are
Honey don't change who you are
Girl don't change on me
Don't you change on me
Girl you're my lucky star
Honey don't change who you are
Don't change on me
Don't you change on me
If there's a heaven
This is my prayer
Lord knows I wanna know you
We should meet there
And then forever
We'll walk together
Nothin' but sunshine
No more stormy weather
I love you just the way you are
Honey don't change who you are
Don't change on me
Don't you change on me
Girl you're my lucky star
Honey don't change who you are
Don't change on me
Don't change on me
Oh now
I love you just the way you are
Honey don't change who you are
Don't change on me
Don't you change on me
Girl you're my lucky star
Honey don't change who you are
Don't change on me
Don't change on meT for Texas, T for Tennessee
T for Texas, T for Tennessee
T for Telma the gal
Who made a wreck out of me
If you don't want me, mama, you sure don't have to stall
If you don't want me, mama, you sure don't have to stall
'Cause I can get more women than a passenger train can haul
Gonna buy me a pistol just as long as I'm tall
Gonna buy me a pistol just as long as I'm tall
I'm gonna shoot poor Telma just to see her jump and fall
Rather drink muddy water, sleep in a hollow log
Rather drink muddy water, sleep in a hollow log
Than to be in Atlanta treated like an old hound dog
Gonna buy me a shotgun with a big long shiny belt
Gonna get me a shotgun with a big long shiny belt
Gonna shoot that rounder the one who stole away my gal
T for Texas, T for TennesseeHey, hey turn up that song, I think about you when it comes on
And I get lifted off the ground
And when you're in my arms I feel the beat down in my heart
It makes my world spin around
So come on baby, you know the moment's right
Yeah, take me by the hand
And we can rock away the night
I want to dance 'til the break of day
To the music that we make
There's never been a sweeter sound
I want to wake the neighbors
Make the headlines in the morning paper
No I don't want to turn it down
'Cause there's nothing the rhythm of love
So play it loud
You're like a melody
And girl it gets all over me
When you move the way you do
And when I feel your touch
Then it gets to be too much
You know it puts me in a mood
Come on baby, don't be shy
Just open up your heart and hold on tight
I want to dance 'til the break of day
To the music that we make
There's never been a sweeter sound
I want to wake the neighbors
Make the headlines in the morning paper
No I don't want to turn it down
'Cause there's nothing the rhythm of love
So play it loud
So come on baby, you know the moment's right
Take me by the hand
And we can rock away the night
I want to dance 'til the break of day
To the music that we make
There's never been a sweeter sound
I want to wake the neighbors
Make the headlines in the morning paper
No I don't want to turn it down
'Cause there's nothing the rhythm of love
So play it loudWouldn't it be cool if all the supermodels tried to look like me
And wouldn't it be cool if someone's character was
something you could see
Wouldn't it be cool if I could fly
Get a new perspective from the sky
Ooo wouldn't it be cool
Wouldn't it be cool if I could do long division in my head
Wouldn't it be cool if I didn't have to edit what I said
Wouldn't it be cool if life was fair
When someone says, "I love you" they will always be there
If one day you beg and plead for me to take you back
I would be so unaffected I would simply laugh and laugh
Wouldn't it be cool... cool
Wouldn't it be cool if I could catch you at a restaurant with her
And wouldn't it be cool if I was strong enough to muster up the nerve
To tell her all the secrets that we had
Just to see you squirm and feel as bad as I do
Wouldn't it be coolWell baby I ain't gonna lie
This ain't my first ride
I've saddled up and bruised my hide a time or two
It's true I'm not a brand-new man
I've been around a block or two and back again
But I've already been broken in
Yeah, I'm the one for you
Well, if you don't mind a hand me down heart
I've got just the thing for you
It's been bruised and it's been used
But it still beats like new
It's got a few burned valves, it's a little worn out
But baby it'll love you true
So if you don't mind a hand me down heart
I've got one for you
I've seen miles and years
I've cried a few thousand tears
But honey let me calm your fears
And leave no doubt
'Cause when you got a rebuilt heart
You only use the very best parts
And it's guaranteed to start lovin' you right now
Well, if you don't mind a hand me down heart
I've got just the thing for you
It's been bruised and it's been used
But it still beats like new
It's got a few burned valves, it's a little worn out
But baby it'll love you true
So if you don't mind a hand me down heart
I've got one for you
I've seen miles and years
I've cried a few thousand tears
But honey let me calm your fears
And leave no doubt
'Cause when you got a rebuilt heart
You only use the very best parts
And it's guaranteed to start lovin' you right now
It's been bruised and it's been used
But it still beats like new
So if you don't mind a hand me down heart
I got one for youYou thought you'd found, found a good girl
One to love you and give you the world
Now you find that you've been misused
Talk to me, I'll do what you choose
I want you to
Tell Mama all about it
Tell Mama what you need
Tell Mama
And I'll make everything alright
That girl you had didn't have no sense
She wasn't worth all the time that you spent
She had another man throw you outdoors
And now the same man is wearing your clothes ooh
Tell Mama all about it
Tell Mama what you need
Ooo tell Mama
And I'll make everything alright
She'd embarrass you anywhere
She'd let everybody know she didn't care
But give me a chance, I'm beggin' you
And I just want to take care, take care of you ooh
Tell Mama what you need
Tell Mama what you need
Tell Mama
I'll make everything,
I'll make everything,
I'll make everything alrightPassin' through passin' through
Sometimes happy sometimes blue that's where I ran into you
Tell the people that you saw me passin' through
[ flute ]
I shivered next to Washington one night at Valley Port
Fightin' men suffer like they do
Men will suffer men will fight even die for what is right
Even though they know they're only passin' through
Passin' through passin' through...
[ banjo ]
At the town of New Orleans the biggest fight I ever seen
Ol' Hickory how you fight the way you do
Had not the way you fight it's fightin' for the right
I've so little time and I'm just passin' through
Passin' through passin' through...
[ trumpet ]
I heard the ragin' cry remembered Alamo Santa Anna you met your Waterloo
Now papa love not hate things to do it's gettin' late
I've so little time and I'm just passin' through
Passin' through passin' through...
Tell the people that you saw me passin' through
Tell the people that you saw me passin' throughHe sang the power and glory down the hill at evenin
The rain, the river roarin, wild geese at their grievin
All the way to nashville town he strayed
The power and glory did not come to meet him
He worked the midnight diners, washed the weary dishes
Street poets and vision miners, starry-eyed ambitious
Blew like pilgrim leaves through the sad cafe
The bards and climbers tradin dreams and wishes
Once the famous aphrodite nightingale came callin
Her court, her keepers friday, foes and hopefuls crawlin
Poor, proud, aging queen, did her eyes betray
The high and mighty know they're only fallin
He came home as before, he had no one to sell to
Kids 'round him on the floor, he sings like silver bells do
When they ask of the world he will only say
The power and glory ain't all that they tell youLast night, my tears they were fallin'
I went to bed so sad and blue
Then I had a dream of you
I dreamed I was strollin' in the evenin'
Underneath the harvest moon
I was thinkin' about you
And then you met me in the moonlight
The stars were shining in your eyes
But another was there too
I don't believe you've met my baby
You looked at her, you looked at me
I wondered who you were talkin' to
I shook the hand of your stranger
But I was shaking more inside
'Cause I was still wonderin' who
Your arm was restin' on her shoulder
You smiled at her, she smiled at you
Her eyes were filled with victory
She said my brother wants to marry
And then my heart was filled with ease
I knew that you would marry me
Oh, I don't believe you've met my baby
You looked at her, you looked at me
I knew that you would marry me
I don't believe you've met my babyLife sure gets lonely alone no one to talk to along
Nights sure get longer since you've gone don't keep me lonely too long
I need your arms to hold me and hear you say you need me
Don't let me live on dreams alone don't keep me lonely too long
Memories of faithful one so lonely
My tortured heart cries out because it loves and wants you only
Yes I'm too lonely alone afraid of being alone without your love I can't go on
Don't keep me lonely too long don't keep me lonely too longBottle of scotch whiskey not very smooth
Like snake bite cure from the medicine man
Not bad poison if there's something to soothe
It's a whole other world in the palm of your hand
Out of this world and out of your mind
Just like it don't matter what you're leaving behind
Trying to change your life you change your point of view
But no matter what you do it's the same old you
Wherever you go there you are
You can run from yourself but you won't get far
You can dive to the bottom of your medicine jar
But wherever you go there you are
Bottle of scotch whiskey whatever you find
When you're out on a wire it's a matter of time
Changing every moment when you're taking the fall
There's everything to gain when you're losing it all
Feel your head spinning with your feet on the ground
You climb the wrong ladder and it's keeping you down
Think you're gettin' higher but you're still layin' low
And you don't want to be anyone you know
Wherever you go there you are
You can run from yourself but you won't get far
You can dive to the bottom of your medicine jar
But wherever you go there you are
Once you've been bitten it's like crossing a line
It's a part of the plan all that's on your mind
Think that it'll help you find somebody to be
But the man in the mirror is all you'll see
Wherever you go there you are
You can run from yourself but you won't get far
You can dive to the bottom of your medicine jar
But wherever you go there you are
I said wherever you go there you areYou got the last of all your stuff
You got your car cranked up
And I guess there ain't a thing that I can say
I'm thinking as I'm standing here
And suddenly it all comes clear
As I watch you drive away
They should have made tail lights blue
So when I see them go
They'll look the way I do
Just a pale blue glow
They should have made I can't stay
Sound like I love you
You know they should have made tail lights blue
I know it's gonna take some time
To get you off my mind
And forget how happy we once were
I don't know how to bring you back
And as a matter of fact
The only thing I know for sure
Is that they should have made tail lights blue
So when I see them go
They'll look the way I do
Just a pale blue glow
They should have made I can't stay
Sound like I love you
You know they should have made tail lights blueI don't want to talk it over anymore
We said it all last night
And time and time, again before
You don't know what you put me through
When you walk out the door
Now, I don't want to talk it over anymore
We'll last about a month again this time
I tried to do you right
But you kept steppin' over the line
Now you're gone; it's ashame but it's the best
Don't be concerned
Cause I don't want to talk it over anymore
Each time we try to say "I love you" once again
And every time we end up right back where we've been
I don't want to talk it over anymore
We said it all last night
And time and time again before
You don't know what you put me through
When you walk out the door
Now, I don't want to talk it over anymore
Each time we try to say "I love you" once again
And every time we end up right back where we've been
I don't want to talk it over anymore
We said it all last night
And time and time before
You don't know what you put me through
When you walk out the door
Now, I don't want to talk it over anymoreMy hopes are high
My guard is down
I'm in a place I never dreamed
I've heard it happens everyday
Well it's my turn
Dare I say
Oh look at me
I have never been so taken in
This is a fight I cannot win
I'm yours
Take me as I am
And I never thought I'd get caught up in a feeling
My heart can't ignore
This is what I've been waiting for
Baby I'm yours
I laid my heart out on the line
Now I know it was worth the risk
Cause when I see you smile I just fall
Oh I surrender all
I just can't resist
I have never been so taken
This is a fight I cannot win
I'm yours
Take me as I am
And I never thought I'd get caught up in a feeling
My heart can't ignore
This is what I've been waiting for
Oh baby I'm yours
I had to let my heart go
Do to circumstances beyond my control
I have never been so taken
This is a fight I cannot win
I'm yours
Take me as I am
And I never thought I'd get caught up in a feeling
My heart can't ignore
This is what I've been waiting for
Oh baby I'm yoursStepchild you've had a hard way to go
How come your daddy run away your mama never did know
All you remember is becoming a step son to your mama's new man
And you got acquainted with the back of his hand
Stepchild you say the man had a son
The son called him daddy but he told you to call him John
You say the legs on the breast of the chicken was gone
When the platter come around your way
And you had to chop cotton while your step brother played
Stepchild when you were born
Your right foot was turned left with your left
And mercy had a way of taking off and leaving you by yourself
Stepchild muddy water got in your well
Stepchild how come your laughing that way
After doing the deed that you've done you better learn how to pray
Stepchild you've got a weird sense of humor
And you came close to gettin' away
But they caught you plantin' garlic on your step daddy's grave
Stepchild when you were born'Til the end of the world rolls round, I'll keep on loving you
As long as the sun goes up and comes down
'Til the big blue sky goes down to the ground
As long as the world goes round and around, I'll keep on loving you
I tried to sail the sea of life, I rowed my boat alone
Your love meant nothing to me dear my heart was made of stone
To a harbor filled with loneliness my little boat was moored
And on the day I first met you I fell right overboard
'Til the end of the world rolls round, I'll keep on loving you
As long as the sun goes up and comes down
'Til the big blue sky goes down to the ground
As long as the world goes round and around, I'll keep on loving you
Whenever you're around me dear my heart just won't be still
And when it comes to kissing you I'll never get my fill
They said I'd never settle down that I would always roam
That I could never be the type for a loving wife and home
'Til the end of the world rolls round, I'll keep on loving you
As long as the sun goes up and comes down
'Til the big blue sky goes down to the ground
As long as the world goes round and around, I'll keep on loving you
So now I know the way I felt was only selfish pride
I thought my heart was fireproof but you burned your way inside
So tell me what I've got to do and tell me how it stands
The cards are on the table dear, my life is in your hands
'Til the end of the world rolls round, I'll keep on loving you
As long as the sun goes up and comes down
'Til the big blue sky goes down to the ground
As long as the world goes round and around, I'll keep on loving you(That's where our love our love must be)
Where the sun takes the dew from the roses
Where winter takes the color from the leaves
Where the frost takes the sweetest of all flowers
That's where that's where our love must be
To that same place go the bubbles from the fountain
And so goes the white foam from the sea
And now since you say your love for me is gone
That's where that's where our love must be
Your love for me just disappeared like the flowers and the dew
So I had to let go of my heart of our love
So they'd meet in that somewhere to be true
In that world of no return lives our love now
That's where that's where our love must beI don't want to be the one who hesitates
Be too shy, wait too late
I don't care what they say other lovers do
I just wanna dance with you.
When I got a feeling that you got a heart like mine
So let it show, let it shine
If we have a chance to make one heart of two
I just wanna dance with you.
I wanna dance with you
Twirl you all around the floor
That's what they intended dancing for
I just wanna dance with you.
I wanna dance with you
Hold you in my arms once more
That's what they invented dancing for
I just wanna dance with you.
I caught you lookin' at me when I looked at you
Yes I did, you know that true
You won't get embarrassed by the things I do
I just wanna dance with you.
Now, the boys are playing softly and the girls are too
So am I, so are you
If this was a movie we'd be right on cue
I just wanna dance with you.
I wanna dance with you
Twirl you all around the floor
That's what they intended dancing for
I just wanna dance with you.
I wanna dance with you
Hold you in my arms once more
That's what they invented dancing for
And I just wanna dance with you.
Oh, I wanna dance with you...I found him by the railroad tracks this morning
I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said
He said, "They let me out of prison back in Frisco"
For 10 long years I've paid for what I'd done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana
Just to see my Rose and get to know my son
Won't you tell them I said thanks, for waiting for me
And tell my boy to help his mama at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another
For it ain't right that she should live alone
Mr., here's the bag with all my money
It won't last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning
Now don't forget to give my love to RoseHe lives next door to everybody in the world
He's everybody's neighbor he is everybody's friend
He alone can make the clouds disappear and let the sunshine in
He shares a dream with everybody in the world
He can always hear your laughter he can always see your tears
He alone can give the answer to drive away your fears
Follow him hear his word and he will lighten your heavy load
Follow him take his hand and you will walk a happy road
Don't be afraid to go down on your knees and pray
He will always be forgiven he can make your life worth livin'
You'll find him no matter what light is unfurled
For he lives next door to everybody in the world
(He lives next door to everybody in the world)Two blue hearts steppin' off a nowhere train
Standin' on a one-way street dreamin' bout a long sea cruise
Gonna have a brand new start
Gonna have a grand new part to play
We're gettin' off a nowhere train
We won't turn back, we got some place to be
A better life ahead for the likes of you and me
Leave our sorrows behind
That was a bad old time we had
We're gettin' off a nowhere train
We were young and we were runnin'
Like our life depended on it
But that ain't no way to live, now is it dear
There were stars a fallin' far and wide
To guide us on our nowhere ride
You don't know where you're goin'
'Til it's the end of the line
Two blue hearts standin' on a dead-end track
Lookin' like the cat drug in dreamin' bout a moonlit kiss
Gonna have a life real sweet
Keep it all nice and neat somehow
We're gettin' off a nowhere train
With this change of reservation
We'll arrive our destination
No memories to haunt us in this world
With these limiles of life behind us
There's no sadness here to bind us
No reason to look back
Now we're just lookin' up ahead
Two blue hearts steppin' off a nowhere train
Standin' on a one way street dreamin' bout a long sea-cruise
Gonna have a life real sweet
Keep it all nice and neat somehow
We're gettin' off a nowhere train
Oh darlin', you and me
We're gettin' off a nowhere trainIt was the thirty first gathering of the
Thompson's, Joneses, and Smiths
There were tables full of chicken
Taters, collard greens, and grits
Well it all took place at Hatie Lake State Park
Volleyball, fishin', badmitton, yard darts
Aunt Irene said she'd never seen a turnout like this
Well it started with hand shakes
And lordy, how the babies have grown
As the sun got hotter the day got to draggin' along
I saw Uncle Gene comin' back from his car
With somethin' clear as water in a mason jar
The lemonade got hearty and, Lordy, the party was on
That ol' boom box got louder and louder
Actin' civilzed didn't seem to matter
Everybody got to showin' their hiney includin' me
Lord I'd never known Granny to take her a sip
But the words were a slurrin' comin' off of her lips
And it dawned on me
White lightnin' hit the family tree
Well cousin Johnny was a gator
Jimmy was a UT fan
And that football talk
Was quickly gettin' out of hand
Granny told Uncle Dave that she hated his guts
Got right up in his face said, your whole famn damily's nuts
Chicken legs got to flyin'
And the whoop started hittin' the fan
Yeah, that ol' boom box got louder and louder
Actin' civilzed didn't seem to matter
Everybody got to showin' their hiney includin' me
Lord I'd never known Granny to take her a sip
But the words were a slurrin' comin' off of her lips
And it dawned on me
White lightnin' hit the family tree
That ol' park ranger jumped out of his car
Said, listen here folks, it's gone a little too far
Tear it all down, pack it all up
Call it quits while there's still a little love
Yeah I've never known Granny to take her a sip
But the words were a slurrin' comin' off of her lips
And it dawned on me
White lightnin' hit the family tree
Yeah it dawned on me
White lightnin' hit the family tree(It's only love it'll go away)
If I don't act myself when I'm around you
And I recall the things you used to say
Well I just haven't learned to forget like you do
But it's only love it'll go away
It's only love it'll go away
At least that's what you say
And if I call at night when you're sleeping
Just to talk about yesterday
Then before I hang up these mem'ries start creeping
Well it's only love it'll go away
But it's only love it'll go awayI was hangin' round Nashville writin' songs and playin' them for all of the stars
Watchin' them laugh and hand 'em back livin' on hope and Hershey bars
So I pawned my guitar and bought a ticket home
And I's a headin' for the trailway bus
When I seen an old pen layin' in the gutter so I reached down and picked it up
It was beaten and bent and cast aside pretty much like myself
So I sat down on the curb and wrote a little song
That told the world how both of us felt
Then I run that song down the Music Row and before I had time to spit
It's pitched and sold and cut for a record
And movin' up the charts and damned it's a hit
So I wrote me another winner then I wrote me a smash again
And I was flyin' off the ground cause I knew I found me a sure hit songrwiter pen
Well the songs they just kept a pourin' out and the money kept pourin' in
I just couldn't miss all it took was a twist of my sure hit songwriter's pen you Remember when I won the Grammy then I won it again and again
Well none of you knew it was all due to my sure hit songwriter's pen
I was a darling of all of the ladies I was a hero among the men
Makin' big dough workin' rodeos and TV shows me and my sure hit songwriter pen
Then one night in Wichita I was just comin' off of the stage all the folks had guithered around, my Lord I was a nation rage.
One little red headed girl was there she was a freciledfaced nine or ten.
She said I have no pincle sir. So I signed with my songwriter pen and handed the pen back to her.
Four o'clock in the morning I woke up with the shakes and the bends
With terror in my eyes cause good God I realized I'd lost my sure hit songwriter pen
I advertised on the radio and I pleaded down the sympathy line
And a whole lotta folks and a whole lotta pens but none of them pens was mine
Well my songs got worse and my money ran out and so did all my good time friends
And there was no doubt I was nothing without my sure hit songwriter pen
So I rolled like a stone down old Skid Row where I feed my blues on wine
And I rest my chops in a two-bit flop and I tell my tale for a drink or a dime
And I sleep with my shoes underneath my head and dream about times back then.
When I blazed my name across the sky with my sure hit songwriter pen
And Somewhere in Wichita tonight there"s a red headded girl she's a freckle faced and nine or ten, doin' her arithmetic homework with a sure hit songwriter's pen
And I say God bless you darling you got a sure hit songwriter pen.
Write me a song.
Send me some money.
You got a sure hit songwriter pen.Spent my whole paycheck
On the goddamn rent
And much more I can piss and moan about
Gonna piss and moan right outta here
Spent the whole damn day
In the goddamn house
Ain't much more I ramble on about
Ramble right on out here
Say you don't know
Where yer money goes
(lincoln, jackson, franklin)
I see yer (abraham, andrew, benjamin)
Wish I had me some of those
Spent my whole damn wad
On food and pot
Ain't much more that I have got
Gonna get it and get out of hereTempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us never molested though in the wrong
Farther along we'll know all about it farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine we'll understand it all by and by
When we see Jesus coming in glory when he comes from his home in the sky
Then we shall meet him in that bright mansion we'll understand it all by and by
Farther along we'll know all about itNight times always party time
In the streets of New Orleans
With the goodtime crowd
The music's loud
In the land of Cajun queens
Just sitting on the barstool
Down to my last cigarette
When she walked through
The smoke-filled room
And our eyes met
And she said
E'tes tu en pour
I couldn't keep from letting know
That I was thinking sure
Et tufe duce me
I said I don't know what you're saying
But it sure sounds good to me
We had a drink and then I think
She must've read my mind
Desire let up my face
Just like that barroom neon sign
And as we danced I held her close
And she whispered in my ear
A Cajun invitation softly
So no one else could hear
She whispered
Voulez vous coucher avec moi?
I said I don't speak the language
But I'm ready when you are
Voulez vous coucher avec moi?
You're sounding awful sexy
And I'm feeling oolala
Things weren't the same
When morning came
'tween my cowboy in me
I kissed her as I whispered
Tu etes magnifique
What will it take to make you
Wanna to stay with me a while?
Just a Cajun invitation
And your sweet southern smile
Voulez vous coucher avec moi?
It didn't take you long to learn
And I'm ready when you are
Voulez vous coucher avec moi?
You're a sexy cowboy
and you got me feeling oolalaWell I only came here for a drink
Maybe two and a bucket of wings
And you walked in and changed my mood
In your cowgirl boots and your rose tattoo
Don't wanna be all outta line
But the way you're lookin' girl is blowin' my mind
I'd be a fool to let you get away so I just gotta say
There's a groovy kind of feelin' in the air tonight
It's playin' with the rhythm of my heart
Got it beatin' just right
If you can feel it and it moves you too
I'd gladly spend the rest of this night groovin' with you
So what do you say we grab some beer
Jump in my truck and get outta here
Take a long ride down a little country road
Let the moonlight take us where it wants to go
We can park somewhere and put the tailgate down
Let the crickets and the critters be the only sound
If you wanna hang out til the morning light
Baby that'll be alright
There's a groovy kind of feelin' in the air tonight
It's playin' with the rhythm of my heart
Got it beatin' just right
If you can feel it and it moves you too
I'd gladly spend the rest of this night groovin' with you
Whoa I'll leave it all up to you
Whoa Come on girl, what do we got to lose
There's a groovy kind of feelin' in the air tonight
It's playin' with the rhythm of my heart
Got it beatin' just right
If you can feel it and it moves you too
I'd gladly spend the rest of this night groovin' with you
Yeah I'd love to spend the rest of this night groovin' with youIs it too late now to tell you that I love you
Or is there still a chance for me somehow
Oh they tell me now that you have found another
Darlin' please don't say it's too late now
I know this heart of mine could never stand it
If I should hurt to give you up somehow
Oh won't you say you'll give me one more chance dear
Darlin' please don't say it's too late now
Is it too late now to tell you that I love you
Or is there still a chance for me somehow
Oh they tell me now that you have found another
Darlin' please don't say it's too late now
Now I'll confess I know I've done you wrong dear
For can't you see my side of it somehow
All I ask of you is one more chance dear
Darlin' please don't say it's too late nowWell, a twister tore the roof off a grocery store
Blew an Idaho potato through the hardwood floor
Twirled granny's apron up around her head
The cat's still missin' and the dog is dead.
Well, ain't love a lot lot that
Ain't love a lot like that
Unconditional, unpredictable
Ain't love a lot like that?
Just like Moses and the Red Sea water
A little bit of faith and the ring I bought her
I hit my knees and she took my hand
And she lead my heart to the promised land.
Ain't love a lot lot that
Ain't love a lot like that
Unconditional, unpredictable
Ain't love a lot like that?
Well, the honeymoon's over and the work begun
My baby say I'm gettin' on her nerves again
One false move and an angry shout
I'm sleepin' all alone on the fold out couch.
Ain't love a lot lot that
Ain't love a lot like that
Unconditional, unpredictable
Ain't love a lot like that?
Ain't love a lot that
Now ain't love a lot like that
Unconditional, unpredictable
Ain't love a lot like that?
Unconditional, unpredictable
Ain't love a lot like that?
Ain't love a lot like that?Now, people say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I'll tell a joke or two.
Although I might be laughin' loud and hearty,
Deep down inside I'm blue.
[Chorus]
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place.
If you'll look closer,
It's easy to trace the tracks of my tears.
I need you, need you.
But since you left me if you see me with another guy,
Seemin' like I'm havin' fun.
He might look good it's true
But he's a substitute 'cause you were the perfect one.
[Chorus]
I need you, I need you.
Outside I'm masqueradin',
'Cause inside my hope is fading.
Like a clown since you put me down,
And my smile is my makeup I wear since my break up with you.
[Chorus: x2]why do you drink, to get drunk
why do you smoke, to get highIf you see me
You don't have to say hello
The way you never said goodbye
So long ago
If you wonder
How I am just fine
Alone right where you left me
Off your mind
When I heard the news
About your life
I never doubted you
Became his wife
But I can safely tell you
I'm okay
Right here where I've stayed
Out of your way
Sometimes I wonder
How I do
This without you
Then sometimes I wonder
If you wonder too
Could that be true
If you wonder
How I am just fine
Alone right where you left me
Off your mind
If you have dreams
About someone like me
Just take those pills of yours
And try to get some sleep
You'll never have to hear
My voice no more
It stopped making sound
When you walked out the doorNothing Good About Lonely
(CDJ/Mary Danna)
I'm staring out the window
On a bright and sunny day
And even though it's beautiful
To me it still looks grey
The condition of my heart is in a desolate state
There's nothin' good about lonely
It hurts like hell
And although I've never been down there
I've felt enough pain to know it just as well
I feel so empty
Without you here to hold me
I'm trying so hard to be happy
But there's nothin' good about lonely
I thought a change of scenery
Would change my point of view
But even the magical ocean
Was just another shade of blue
Getting outta bed is getting harder to doA bunch of old cowboys are making their noise
At the rodeos across the land
They're all over forty but let me tell you Lordy
They're still tough rodeo hands
Well, their age may be showing and their gray hairs a growing
And they ought to be a packing it in, but there's Broncs to be rode
And steers to be throwed and the wild bunch is riding again
The wild bunch is riding again
Yeah, they may be getting gray and they may be getting old
And the years and the miles have taken their toll
And the old arthritis is a setting in, but the wild bunch is riding again
The wild bunch is riding again
They ain't getting any younger but they still got a hunger
For the glory and a chance to win
Though their hides getting wrinkled and their body's all crinkled
They're as wild as they've ever been
They know they ought to hang it up but Lord it's mighty tough
Just to leave it all in yesterday, they're gonna keep on a riding
Gonna keep on trying oh, they ain't gonna fade away
They ain't gonna fade away
Yeah, they may be getting gray and they may be getting old
And the years and the miles have taken their toll
And the old arthritis is a setting in, but the wild bunch is riding again
The wild bunch is riding again
Yeah, they may be getting gray and they may be getting old
And the years and the miles have taken their toll
And the old arthritis is a setting in, but the wild bunch is riding again
The wild bunch is riding again, the wild bunch is riding againIt's hung there on the front porch
Since this old house was built
It's where the old men whittle
And the women fleece their quilts
It's held four generations
Through whatever life could bring
That ol' swing
That ol' porch swing
It held a grieving widow
When my daddy's daddy died
And now it rocks my children
When they close their sleepy eyes
It's where I popped the question
With a quarter karat ring
That ol' swing
That ol' porch swing
It's been there through the sunshine
It's had it's share of rain
Been a witness to some good times
And a like amount of pain
If it could tell it's story
What a violin could sing
That ol' swing
That ol' porch swing
It's where brother read the letter
That sent him off to war
We knew he had to go and fight
But we didn't know what for
When he came home he just sat there
And never said a thing
In that swing
That ol' porch swing
It's been there through the sunshine
It's had it's share of rain
Been a witness to some good times
And a like amount of pain
If it could tell it's story
What a violin could sing
That ol' swing
That ol' porch swing
That ol' swing
That ol' porch swingYou?ve been waltzing in and out of this life for so long its getting to be old hat
I bet you never thought that you could ever go so wrong
But right now that?s where you?re at, It?s time to face the cold hard fact
CHORUS
Between here and the front door
You better think of something, think of something real fast
I ain?t stopping you anymore
You?re about to say something that you can?t take back
So there?s nothing I can do but draw a line down the middle
Of the living room floor, and it?s all going down between here and the front door
Well you?re doing it again, changing colors with the wind
Well baby get it understood
If you?re gonna go, go but if you?re gonna stay, stay
But this time you?re staying for good, hey I?d help you if I could
CHORUS
This is where it happens, this it where it gets real
I don?t want to lose you, you know how I feel
CHORUSYou said we met too late dear, I'm nectar you are wine
But we both know, sweet honey, that you'll catch me down the line
(Youll catch me down the line, youll catch me down the line)
It's okay, my darling, please don't pay it any mind
I know what you're thinking, I can see your heart is kind
(I can see your heart is kind, I can see your heart is kind)
Oh, everywhere I'm going now, everything I do
It all just keeps leading me right on back to you
I met you in the springtime but you found me in the fall
but like an apple in the garden still you tempt me most of all
(You tempt me most of all, you tempt me most of all)
You say we met too late dear, I'm nectar you are wine
But we both know, sweet honey, that you'll catch me down the line
(Youll catch me down the line, youll catch me down the line)
You don't have to explain it or wish it weren't that way
just keep me in your heart, dear, don't ever turn away
(Dont ever turn away, dont ever turn away)
Oh, everywhere I'm going now, everything I do
It all just keeps leading me right on back to you
So don't be sad, my darling, it's you that I adore
I'll take the love you've got for now and I'll be back for more
(Ill be back for more, Ill be back for more)full growed porcupine dead on the road
it'll take a big ox, son, to carry that load
i got checked out by a blonde, young heifer
she says she might wanna but i ain't gonna let er
hair in my eyes like a highland steer
spring in my step like a white tailed deer
hitch in my hip like an old sheep dog
puff up my chest like a big bull frog
socks on my feet like a true paint hoss
belt round my belly like a galloway cross
built a barn outta straw for to not pay rent
the thing blew over like a cheap green tent
hair in my eyes like a highland steer
spring in my step like a white tailed deer
hitch in my hip like an old sheep dog
puff up my chest like a big bull frog
yodel-ay
smoke in the barbed wire, posts on fire
anybody seen my lucky fencing pliers?
they didn't cost nothin cuz they come with the truck
and old uncle hugh's still bringin me luck
hair in my eyes like a highland steer
spring in my step like a white tailed deer
hitch in my hip like an old sheep dog
puff up my chest like a big bull frogYou'd never know by looking
We were ever more than strangers
But, we're celebrating ten years
Of wedded bliss
She made the rounds as usual
While, I sit here stoned, as usual
Lord, I can't believe we survived
Ten years of this!
Ten years together
A million nights alone
Whose mistake is it?
What do we blame it on?
If someone else would tell me
What I already know in my mind
I'm afraid I'd start talking
With my fists
But, I know.. I'm lying
What ain't dead, by now is dying
What in hell kept us together
For ten years of this?
Ten years together
A million nights alone!
Whose mistake is it?
What do we blame it on?
Maybe you start cheating
Because you married so young
Whatever it is, I cain't go home
I know, I cain't take it
Too long, I've had to fake it
I just don't think we can make it
Through ten more years of this...!He didn't have the answers
To half the questions his son asked him
A child's mind is a curious thing
But when his son hugged him and said
"Dad you know I love you, how much do you love me?"
Daddy didn't have to think
With his arms open wide just as far as they could go
He said, "As far as I can reach is not enough to show
I would give my life for you, you are my flesh and blood
I love you this much"
She stood there crying
Broken-hearted looking up at him
And said, "Son why are you doing this?"
He looks down at her wanting to hold her
And wipe her tears away,
but he has to leave and that's the way it is
She gave her son one last kiss
With her arms open wide just as far as they could go
She said, "As far as I can reach is not enough to show
I would give my life for you, you are my flesh and blood
I love you this much"
And they raised His broken body above the crowd
Drove in the nails as the rain came down
With His arms open wide just as far as they could go
He said, "As far as I can reach is not enough to show
I would give my life for you, you are my flesh and blood
I love you this much, I love you this much"There are only so many tears you can cry,
Till your heart stops breaking.
Only so many doors you can try,
Till you finally find your way.
Out of the dark, into the light,
No, the clouds won't always be grey.
The sun reappears in the blink of an eye,
And there's only so many tears you can cry.
There are only so many reasons to give up,
You're not even close.
You got to believe in the power of love,
That's all anyone knows.
And what makes you strong comes from inside,
And as far as weather and woes.
Buckets of rain can fall from the sky,
But there's only so many tears you can cry.
Get on with it, get on with life,
Forget about who's wrong or right.
Come out and dance with me tonight,
And we'll laugh, laugh, laugh those tears away.You give to me what life should be for everyone.
You're my pepper, you're my salt, my favorite tea.
You're my sunset on the ocean, my desert dawn.
So much of you is now a part of me.
I know a greater power must have noticed me,
And decided I would meet someone like you.
No-one on this planet thought we could ever be,
Till He gave my heart to you, and yours to me.
You've given us our children and a recipe:
For you and I, love comes naturally.
My love is somehow different than I'd have it be,
An' it's workin' on my heart, not into me.
So I know a greater power must have noticed me,
And decided I would meet someone like you.
No-one on this planet thought we could ever be,
Till He gave my heart to you, and yours to me.Well I recall his parting words
Must I accept his fate
Or take myself far from this place
I thought I heard a black bell toll
A little bird did sing
Man has no choice
When he wants every thing
We'll rise above the scarlet tide
That trickles down through the mountain
And separates the widow from the bride
Man goes beyond his own decision
Gets caught up in the mechanism
Of swindlers who act like kings
And brokers who break everything
The dark of night was swiftly fading
Close to the dawn of day
Why would I want him just to lose him again
We'll rise above the scarlet tide
That trickles down through the mountain
And separates the widow from the brideTHE CHRYSTAL CHANDELIERS LIGHT UP THE PAINTINGS ON YOUR WALL. THE MARBLE STATUETS ARE STANDING STATELY IN THE HALL, BUT WILL THE TIMELY CROWD THAT HAS YOU LAUGHING LOUD HELP YOU DRY YOUR TEARS, WHEN THE NEW REARS OFF OF YOUR CHRYSTAL CHANDELIERSAmazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I seeBaby sweet sweet baby my world's so cold and empty since you've gone
Baby sweet sweet baby without you I don't know how I'll go on
I've got that lonesome feeling deep inside of me
And it just keeps right on hurtin' all the time
Oh I'd forget you if it wasn't for your memory
You're out of sight but you're never never out of my mind
Oh baby sweet sweet baby I can't help loving you the way I do
Baby sweet sweet baby please come on back and call me baby too babyYou lived through the crash on the highway it's a miracle you're here today
You say Lady Luck was ridin' with you but it might be that your mother prayed
You were saved in the war over yonder
You say your good luck charm pulled you through
But the only reason that you might be living
Is your mother just might have been prayin' for you
Don't give Lady Luck all of the credit it might have been your mother's prayer
She holds the key to the powers in heaven and pleads with your Maker up there
Now you call yourself lucky and believe that it's true
But your mother just might have been prayin' for you
[ steel ]
Don't give Lady Luck...Sure feels good, sure feels right
Sure enough feels like love tonight
Ain't no movie, ain't no bar
Ain't nothin' out there beats where we are
Lay back baby, catch your breath
This fire ain't as hot as it's gonna get
We're just getting' started, ain't close to done
There's a whole lot more where that came from
We've been workin' so hard, had no breaks
Gotta lotta overdue love to make
If we get no sleep, well that's okay
'Bout time me and you and me got this way
Lay back baby, catch your breath
This fire ain't as hot as it's gonna get
We're just getting' started, ain't close to done
There's a whole lot more where that came from
Well, come on baby, we can't stop now
No givin' in 'til we both give out
Lay back baby, catch your breath
This fire ain't as hot as it's gonna get
We're just getting' started, ain't close to done
There's a whole lot more where that came from
We're just getting' started, ain't this fun
There's a whole lot more where that came from
Yeah, there's a whole lot more where that came from
Oh yeahI wake up with the sun on my face
On the edge of the bed, babe you're taking up all the space
I roll you over then I give you a kiss
Meet you in the middle
That's where all the fun is
[Chorus]
Life as we know it
It's going good
That's an understatement
It's going better than I ever thought it could
Never been so happy, so content
Oh, I wish I could freeze this moment
Life as we know it, now
You're doing dishes if I'm cooking the meal
We got an understanding, and it's a pretty good deal
We read our books at each end of the couch
No conversation needed
To stay in touch in this house
[Chorus]
I whisper, I love you
You tell me, you love me too
It's so easy, so simple
I wonder why we didn't think of this before
[Chorus]I look out to the east of the Colorado sky
The canyons are throwin' dust in the storms eye
And the storms gettin' angry I know that its so
It's fixin' to blow away a little more of Colorado
It seems to be a twister as the clouds begin to cry
And there goes momma clothesline leavin' on the fly
Here come the rain drops ten thousand four
It's gonna wash away our little part of Colorado
The mules are gettin' restless its hard to keep them shy
Don't they know they've got to get us to the other side
The fence is fallin' down and the barns about to go
As I watch the storm take away my part of Colorado
Most of all we want our lives and that's a fact
And what little we're taking the wind wants it back
Run momma run and try to get the mules to go
And God help us get the hell away from Colorado
I look out to the east of the Colorado sky
The canyons are throwin' dust in the storms eye
And the storms gettin' angry I know that its so
It's fixin' to blow away a little more of Colorado
ColoradoI take out my guitar and strum all my dreams
It's somewhere around here I know
Don't let me chase rainbows that don't would have an end
There must be a song I can sing
Where is the melody and where are the words where is the rhythm of the drum
And where are the voices that can make my heart bring
I know there's a song I can sing
And if I keep trying find a secret to wake me from my dream
That sleeps on the footsteps of my soul
Some day I'll hear the music that can bring my voice swings
Cause I know there's a song I can sing
Yes some day I'll hear the melody and I'll find the words
And I'll feel the rhythm of the drum
And I'll listen to the voices that can make my heart bring
Yes somewhere there's a song I can sing
Yes some day I'll hear the melody...Someday when I'm old
I'll pull up to the store
And park wherever the hell I want to
I'll buy a box of Moon Pies
And flirt with the cashier
Yeah, like I was still twenty-two
I'll bitch about eighteen dollars for a
Gallon of gas
Down at the Texaco
Someday when I'm old
Yeah, someday when I'm old
I'll keep chewing gum in my front pocket
And cold Dr. Pepper in the fridge
I'll let my daughter get mad
Say I'm ruining their supper
When I give that stuff to my grandkids
And I realize that some things,
They just don't matter
And how fast it all goes
Someday when I'm old
That clock just starts ticking
Oh, the day that you're born
And no matter how much time you get
You always want more
Someday when I'm old
I'll be the only one
Who remembers you young and beautiful
Your dark hair falling on that pillowcase
All the secrets we shared, all the
Love that we made
And I'll hold onto those precious moments
Like pieces of gold
Someday when I'm oldShe's got a mind of her own
But her heart belongs to me
Oh, she could make it alone
But where on earth would I be
She'll listen but she won't do
What she's told
Sometime's she's hard to handle
But she's always easy to hold
She's strong enough
To stand on her own two feet
Oh but I'm so glad
Sometimes she leans on me
She's the kind of woman
That no man can control
Sometimes she's hard to handle
But she's always easy to hold
When she don't
Get what she wants
There's hell to pay
And the truth be known
I wouldn't want her
Any other way
There's some devil in every angel
There are thorns with every rose
Sometimes she's
Hard to handle
But she's always easy to holdTulsa
There's a detour sign on the road that winds
Out on the broad highway
But the place for me is the sign I see
T U L S A straight ahead
There's a railroad crossing and the bus-a rockin'
Just-a takin' me away
But I'll pass the time, till I see that sign
T U L S A straight ahead
I'm gonna settle down when I reach that city fair
I'm homeward bound and I know I'll soon be there
Where the tall corn grows and the black all flows
In old Oak, K L A
In the middle of it all I hear the call
T U L S A straight ahead
I'm gonna settle down when I reach that city fair
I'm homeward bound and I know I'll soon be there
Well, there's no use talkin', 'cause I'll get there walkin'
If there's is no other way
'Cause I read that sign on the old state line
T U L S A straight aheadOh i imagine
I've broken a couple of hearts
Sure i've had moments
Sudden feelin' hit me too hard
I don't wanna be bitter anymore
Wanna let the sunshine in my door
I don't wanna be too happy
Just enough to keep me goin'
Cause it won't feel like home
Without something to hold me back
Without something to pull behind me
No it won't be the same
Without a reason to say goodbye
Without a reason to cry
I've clung to the anchor
When they tried to be my rescue
And i've taken the wrong turn on occasion
I could see the thing come crashin' down
There was nothin' left there anyhow
I don't wanna be too happy
Just enough to tide me overThere's a whole lotta people lookin' down their noses at me
'Cause I didn't come from a wealthy family
There was ten of us livin' in a two room shack
On the banks of the river by the railroad track
We kept chickens in a pen in the back and everybody said we was po' folks
My daddy was a farmer but all he ever raised was us
Dug a forty foot well struck thirty-six gallons of dust
Salvation Army give us clothes to wear a man from the county came to cut our hair
We lived next door to a millionare but we wadn't nothin' but po' folks
We was po' folks livin' in a rich folks world we sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door he'd've had to brought a picnic lunch
My grandaddy's pension was a dollar and thirty-three cents
That was ten dollar less than the landlord wanted for rent
The landlord's letters got nasty indeed he wrote get out but pa couldn't read
And we was too broke to even pay heed but that's how it is when you're po' folks
We was po' folks livin' in a rich folks world we sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door he'd've had to brought a picnic lunch
But we had something in our house money can't buy
Kept us warm in the winter cool when the sun was high
For whenever we didn't have food enough and the howlin' winds would get pretty rough
We patched the cracks and set the table with love
'Cause that's what you do when you're po' folks and we wadn't nothin' but po' folks
My mom and my dad was po' folks my brother and my sister was po' folks
My dog and my cat was po' folks and even the po' folks was po' folksAlways remember I love you I love you only you
Always remember your whole life through I love you just you
I'd give anything in this world if I could be with you right now
And hold you real tight in my arms
But since I can't I thought maybe if you knew how much I missed you
It might help you feel peaceful and warm
Always remember I love you I love you you just you
Always remember your whole life through I love you just you
And I ever thought I won't be there to lay down beside you tonight
It's not because I don't care
Darling you're in every thought that I think every dream and every prayer
So always remember I love you I love you just youI was takin' a trip out to LA
Toolin' along in my Chevrolet
Tokin' on a number and diggin' on the radio
Jes' as I cross the Mississippi line
I heard that highway start to whine
And I knew that left rear tire was about to go
Well the spare was flat and I got uptight
'Cause there wasn't a fillin' station in sight
So I jes' limped down the shoulder on the rim
I went as far as I could and when I stopped the car
It was right in front of this little bar
A kind of a redneck lookin' joint called the Dew Drop Inn
Well I stuffed my hair up under my hat
And told the bartender that I had a flat
And would he be kind enough to give me change for a one
There was one thing I was sure proud to see
There wasn't a soul in the place 'cept for him an' me
And he just looked disgusted an' pointed toward the telephone
I called up the station down the road a ways
And he said he wasn't very busy t'day
And he could have somebody there in jest 'bout ten minutes or so
He said now you jes' stay right where yer at and I didn't bother
Tellin' the durn fool
I sure as hell didn't have anyplace else to go
I just ordered up a beer and sat down at the bar
When some guy walked in an' said who owns this car
With the peace sign the mag wheels and four on the floor
Well he looked at me and I damn near died
And I decided that I'd jus wait outside
So I layed a dollar on the bar and headed for the door
Jes' when I thought I'd get outta there with my skin
These five big dude come strollin' in
With this one old drunk chick and some fella with green teeth
An' I was almost to the door when the biggest one
Said you tip your hat to this lady son
An' when I did all that hair fell out from underneath
Now the last thing I wanted was to get into a fight
In Jackson Mississippi on a Saturday night
'Specially when there was three of them and only one of me
Well they all started laughin' and I felt kinda sick
And I knew I'd better think of somethin' pretty quick
So I jes' reached out an' kicked ol' green-teeth right in the knee
He let out a yell that'd curl your hair
But before he could move I grabbed me a chair
And said watch him folks 'cause he's a thouroughly dangerous man
Well you may not know it but this man's a spy
He's an undercover agent for the FBI
And he's been sent down here to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan
He was still bent over holdin' on to his knee
But everyone else was lookin' and listenin' to me
And I layed it on thicker and heavier as I went
I said would you beleive this man has gone as far
As tearin' Wallace stickers off the bumpers of cars
And he voted for George McGoveren for president
Well he's a friend of them long-haired hippie type pinko fags
I betcha he's even got a Commie flag
Tacked up on the wall inside of his garage
He's a snake in the grass I tell ya guys
He may look dumb but that's jus a disguise
He's a mastermind in the ways of espionage
They all started lookin' real suspicious at him
And he jumped up an' said jes' wait a minute Jim
You know he's lyin' I've been livin' here all of my life
I'm a faithfull follower of Brother John Burch
And I belong to the Antioch Baptist Church
And I ain't even got a garage you can call home and ask my wife
Then he started sayin' somethin' 'bout the way I was dressed
But I didn't wait around to hear the rest
I was too busy movin' and hopin' I didn't run outta luck
And when I hit the ground I was makin' tracks
And they were jes' takin' my car down off the jacks
So I threw the man a twenty an' jumped in an' fired that mother up
Mario Andretti woulda sure been proud
Of the way I was movin' when I passed that crowd
Comin' out the door and headin' toward me in a trot
An' I guess I shoulda gone ahead an' run
But somehow I couldn't resist the fun
Of chasin' them jes' once around the parkin' lot
Well they're headin' for their car but I hit the gas
And spun around and headed them off at the pass
Well I was slingin' gravel and puttin' a ton of dust in the air
Well I had them all out there steppin' an' a fetchin'
Like their heads were on fire and their asses was catchin'
But I figured I oughta go ahead an split before the cops got there
When I hit the road I was really wheelin'
Had gravel flyin' and rubber squeelin'
An' I didn't slow down 'til I was almost to Arkansas
I think I'm gonna re-route my trip
I wonder if anybody'd think I'd flipped
If I went to LA via Omaha!Hold Me - Charlie Major
I don't feel much like talking tonight, If that's alright with you.
It's been one of those days I just wanna forget, All that I've been through
Sometimes life in this whole world, Can get the best of me
That's when in the comfort of your arms, Is where I want to be.
So hold me for a little while
Let me hide behind your sweet, sweet smile
Help me leave my troubles far behind
And ease my worried mind
And hold me for a little while.
I don't know how these things I do, get turned so upside down
All the best laid plans so carefully worked, out in pieces on the ground
Sometimes the weight of this whole world, can drive me to my knees
That's when in the quiet of your arms, I find escape I need.
So hold me for a little while
Let me hide behind your sweet, sweet smile
Help me leave my troubles far behind
And ease my worried mind
And hold me for a little while.
Sometimes I wanna close my eyes and wake to find, that it's all been a bad dream
Sometimes I wanna run so fast and far away, no one will ever find me
Sometimes all I need to know, is you're beside me
So hold me for a little while
Let me hide behind your sweet, sweet smile
Help me leave my troubles far behind
And ease my worried mind
And hold me for a little while.
Hold me ...for a little while
Hold meAll your love lifting me higher
Than I ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
Then I'll be at your side forevermore
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
Now once I was downhearted
This little loneliness my foes and friend
But when you came, he soon departed
And he never showed his face again
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
I'm so glad I finally found you
Yes that one in a million girl
And now with my loving arms around you
I can stand up and face the world
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higherEvery Sunday mornin' that old preacher lets his sermon ring
His only daughters in the choir and I hang on every word she sings
I heard him say that blessing is the man who looks on lovely things
Well I don't know how much more blessed I could ever be
[Chorus]
Hallelujah, I see an angel right before my eye (when the spirit moves ya)
Just gotta stand up and testify
Preacher can you save me I'm in love with your daughter
I gotta either come hell or high water
He must of caught me looking at her
'Cause he started preachin' brimstone and fire
He said boy you're gonna burn if you don't learn how to control your desire
Well preacher I've been burnin' since the moment I walked in
So make it short and sweet and pass a plate and say amen
[Chorus]
Oh lord won't you forgive me for the sin I know
I'm thinkin' things I'm thinkin' but its out of my control
[Chorus]
I can't forget her even though I know I oughta
I've gotta either come hell or high waterTous les jours on retourne la scÃ¨ne
Juste fauve au milieu de l'arÃ¨ne
On ne renonce pas, on essaye,
De regarder droit dans le soleil
Et ton cÅur au labour de lumiÃ¨re
Quand l'amour revient Ã  la poussiÃ¨re
On ne se console pas, on s'enraye
Mais on regarde droit dans le soleil
Ã la croisÃ©e des Ã¢mes sans sommeil
L'enfer est myope autant que le ciel
On t'avait dit que tout se paye
Regarde bien droit dans le soleil
Tourne, tourne la Terre
Tout se dissout dans la lumiÃ¨re
L'acier et les ombres qui marchent
Ã tes cotÃ©s
Dans le parfum des nuits sans pareil
Et l'Ã©clat des corps qui s'Ã©merveillent
Ses lÃ¨vres avaient un goÃ»t de miel
On regardait droit dans le soleil
Les serments se dispersent dans l'air
Et les mots qui retombent Ã  l'envers
On ne sait plus comment Ã§a s'Ã©pelle
Regarder droit dans le soleil
Tourne, tourne la Terre
Tout se dissout dans la lumiÃ¨re
L'acier et les ombres qui marchent
Ã tes cotÃ©s
AssiÃ©gÃ© par le chant des sirÃ¨nes
Sentinelle au milieu de la plaine
Le tranchant de l'Åil en Ã©veil
Pour regarder droit dans le soleil.Now you bake right (uh-huh) with Martha White (yes, ma'am)

My love for you is deeper than the depths of any ocean,
And as faithful as the stars that grace the night,
As constant as the sun making its journey through heavens,
and we'll always be together you and I.

[Chorus]
Together you and I can stop the rain and make the sun shine.
Paint a pretty rainbow, brushed with love across the sky,
Together you and I belong, like a songbird and a song
and we'll always be together you and I
--
Life with you is sweeter than the fragrance of the flowers
And as happy as the laughter of a child
As peaceful as a river and as lasting as forever
you know we'll always be together you and I
[Chorus]
I always be beside or close behind you.
Wherever you go, you'll always know I'll always find you
[Chorus]
We'll always be together, you and I
Forever together, forever you and I
(forever you and I du-du)
Forever together, together you and I will always be
(together, together)
Together, you and I........Written by billy burnette and kostas.
(chorus)
(got a) rock in my shoe, a rock in my shoe
Driving me crazy
Won't come loose
Rattle and shake, blowing a fuse
Can't stop got a little rock in my shoe
When I was a baby, long ago
Mama would rock me to and fro'
Daddy would play that rock and roll
Hooked me then and never let me go
(repeat chorus)
Couldn't sit still when I was in school
Didn't care much about the golden rule
They called me a rebel, called me a fool
They couldn't see I had a little rock in my shoe
(repeat chorus)
Now if you got troubles, you got some blues
You think the world's coming down on you
Don't worry honey, here's some news
All you need's a little rock in your shoe
(repeat chorus)They're comin' across the border by the thousands everyday
Lookin' for a better life in the good ol' U.S.A.
Well, everybody's talkin' about the aliens invadin'
While I'm savin' every dime for a Mexican vacation
Me, I'm headed your way, hasta luego Jose
You say "hola", I'll say "hi"
When I pass you at the border slap me a high five
You better pack a poncho 'cause it sure gets cold up here
Me, I'm headed south for hot women and cheap beer
Here's the keys to my Chevrolet
You can have the house and the bills I pay
Welcome to the good ol' U.S.A.
I'm headed your way, Jose
(Cuervo that is, lil' sunshine, some margaritas,
Cabo San Lucas, maybe go see Chichinitza, I love that word)
Up here we work our asses off just tryin' to get ahead
But you can't spend a dollar if you've worked yourself to death
From what I hear you way of life is an afternoon siesta
Then back to work for a little while for an all night long fiesta
Me, I'm headed your way
Well sounds to me like a pretty fair trade
You say "hola", I'll say "hi"
When I pass you at the border slap me a high five
You better pack a poncho 'cause it sure gets cold up here
Me, I'm headed south for hot women and cheap beer
Here's the keys to my Chevrolet
You can have the house and the bills I pay
Welcome to the good ol' U.S.A.
I'm headed your way, Jose
(White sandy beaches, pesos and jalapenos,
Palm trees, ocean breeze, ah man, Dos Equis)Verse 1
I'm in the way, the bright and shining way, I'm in the gloryland way;
Telling the world that Jesus saves today, Yes I'm in the gloryland way.
I'm in the glory land way I'm in the gloryland way.
Chorus
I'm in the glory-land way, I'm in the glory-land way;
Heaven is nearer, and the way growth clearer,
For I'm in the gloryland way.
Chorus 2
List to the call, the gospel call today, Get in the gloryland way;
Wanderers come home, O hasten to obey,
And get in the gloryland way.
Verse 3
Onward I go, rejoicing in His love, I'm in the gloryland way;
Soon I shall see Him in that home above,
O, I'm in the gloryland way.You got the mood for a backup dancer
You got a way to make time stand still
You got my heart in the palm of your hands girl
You got to know you always will
When you kiss me on the lips
Baby, that's good as it gets
Keeps me comin' back for more
Like the ocean to the shore
Just a whisper in my ear
All my worries disappear
You take my breath away every time you
Say my name, whoa (3Ã)
You and me and the fireflies dancing
Searching for each other in the dark
We let the night sky be our sickest dream
There's no denying you're a superstar
When you kiss me on the lips
Baby, that's good as it gets
Keeps me comin' back for more
Like the ocean to the shore
Just a whisper in my ear
All my worries disappear
You take my breath away every time you
Say my name, whoa (3Ã)
Tonight's all we got (I want to taste every last drop)
Please don't ever stop (Don't ever stop)
When you kiss me on the lips
Baby, that's good as it gets
Keeps me comin' back
Keep me comin' back
Just a whisper in my ear
All my worries disappear
You take my breath away every time you
Say my name, whoa (3Ã)Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart
If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way
To show her every day
That she's my only one
If my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes
'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance
To tell her how I feel
If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way
To show her every day
That she's my only one
If my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes
So tell that someone that you love
Just what you're thinking of
If tomorrow never comesWell I went down to a Music City function
Where I just heard a song that I had to howl out
My lawyers told my to proceed with caution
Or I'd make a whole lot of songwriters mad
Uh-huh
And I said
Hey John Michael Montgomery won't mind
If I take a song and make it mine all mine
Like I did so many times with old Tim McGraw's
Yeah I never heard anything sound so fine
Mind if I borrow one or two of your lines
Well I stole it once stole it twice
I STOLE it from a writer on Music Row
Well he just moved to town and he didn't know
About ASCAP, SESAC, or BMI
So he might as well kiss his song goodbye
I had my number two pencil going about a mile a minute
Till I had his ideas all written down
And I knew I really went and did it
When the police came and hauled my butt downtown
And I said
Hey John Michael Montgomery won't mind
If I steal a song and make it mine all mine
Like I did so many times with Tim McGraw's
Yeah I never heard anything sound so fine
Mind if I borrow one or two of your lines
Well I stole it once stole it twice
I STOLE that song and I must confess
When I went to court I plead no contest
Got a big fat lip and two black eyes
Never should have messed with his copyright
Yeah
I told the judge I had writers block but he hauled my butt away
And now it hurts too much to laugh about the song I stole that day
When I said
Hey John Michael Montgomery won't mind
If I steal a song and make it mine all mine
Like I did so many times with Tim McGraw
Yeah I never heard anything sound so fine
Mind if I borrow one or two of your lines
So I stole it once stole it twice
I STOLE it from a writer on Music Row
Well he just moved to town and he didn't know
About ASCAP, SESAC, or BMI
So he might as well kiss his song goodbye

WHEE!!!!Are there angels in the wilderness? I don't know.
I've got my doubts, but if you say so .
But I've got a feeling we're doing ok.
We're doing our part, to make the brambles seem less sharp.
When you ask for bread, will I give you stone?
Will I make you confess it, or leave it alone?
If it consoles you will I take it away?
Hold my hand. Help me to understand.
You break my heart again and again.
I'll never get use to that sensation.
All those locusts just trying to get out.
Devouring with tiny bites, all that lies in site.
Fly forgotten like a prayer.
Fly forgotten like a dream.
Fly forbidden. Fly unseen
Fly, fly, fly away from me.
Are there angels in the wilderness? I don't know.
But I will give you my love and watch the bitterness grow.
And then will I take it and hide it away?
And wait on the day when the balance tips your way.
Fly forgotten like a prayer.
Fly forgotten like a dream.
Fly forbidden. Fly unseen
Fly, fly, fly away from me.
Are there angels in the wilderness?
I don't know.In the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia there's a girl who is waitin' just for me
Many times we walked in the moonlight and in her loving arms I long to be
I miss her smile in the moonlight and I know she misses me too
In the Shenandoah Valley of Virgiania I know that her love is still true
[ fiddle - steel ]
In the Shenandoah Valley...I've been on the road twenty years ten thousand nights and a million beers
But I'm tired of the road Joe it's no fun anymore Joe
I'm savin' my money and I'll be goin' home soon
I've lived good played with the best stayed up for days and never got no rest
But I'm gettin' old Joe tired of the road Joe
I'm savin' my money I'll be goin' home soon
Ain't it funny how things don't work out the way you had 'em planned
One day you just turn around and it's slipped right through your hand
These bandstand lights they won't erase
The wrinkles in my hand and the lines in my face
But I'm gettin' old Joe tired of the road Joe
I'm savin' my money and I'll be goin' home soonHow long, baby how long,
Has that evening train been gone?
[Chorus]
How long,
How how long,
Baby how long?
Went to the station, didn't see no train.
Down in my heart, I have an aching pain.
[Chorus]
I feel disgusted, I feel so bad
Thinking 'bout the good time that I once have had.
[Chorus]
I could see the green grass growing on the hill;
I ain't seen no greenback on a dollar bill.
[Chorus]
You're gonna be sorry, you'll feel so blue.
When you want me, baby, I declare I won't want you.
[Chorus]
Don't have no money for to ride the train.
I would ride the rods, baby, to be with you again.
[Chorus]
How long, baby how long
Must I keep my, my watch in pawn?Well I gotta get drunk
And I sure do dread it
'Cause I know just what I'm gonna do
I'll start to spend my money
Calling everybody honey
And wind up singing the blues
I'll spend my whole paycheck
On some old wreck
And brother I can name you a few
But I gotta get drunk
And I sure do dread it
'Cause I know just what I'm gonna do
I gotta get drunk I can't stay sober
There's a lot of good people in town
Who'd like to hear me holler
See me spend my dollars
And I wouldn't think of lettin' 'em down
There's a lot of doctors that tell me
That I'd better start to slowin' it down
But there's more old drunkers
Than there are old doctors
So I guess we'd better have another round
Well now I gotta get drunk
And I sure do dread it
'Cause I know just what I'm gonna do
I'll start to spend my money
Calling everybody honey
And wind up singing the blues
I'll spend my whole paycheck
On some old wreck
And brother I can name you a few
Well I gotta get drunk
And I sure do dread it
'Cause I know just what I'm gonna do
Well I gotta get drunk
And I sure do dread it
'Cause I know just what I'm gonna do
I'll start to spend my money
Calling everybody honey
And wind up singing the blues
I'll spend my whole paycheck
On some old wreck
And brother I can name you a few
Well I gotta get drunk
And I sure do dread it
'Cause I know just what I'm gonna doYeah they oughta make a brand new whiskey
And give it a woman's name
A man needs something to hold onto
When a goodbye hits him like a hurricane
Make it sweet, as sweet as her lips
Something special like champagne
Yeah they oughta make a brand new whiskey
And give it a woman's name
Leaving's the reason I'm drinking
Oh I've never felt so alone
Night and day I stay stoned
Hoping to forget she's gone
I never thought she'd do me so dirty
Together forever she promised me
She took her promise and left a memory
The day the woman walked out on me
Yeah they oughta make a brand new whiskey
And give it a woman's name
A man needs something to hold onto
When a goodbye hits him like a hurricane
Make it sweet, as sweet as her lips
Something special like champagne
Yeah they oughta make a brand new whiskey
And give it a woman's name
Yeah they oughta make a brand new whiskey
And give it a woman's name
A man needs something to hold onto
When a goodbye hits him like a hurricane
Make it sweet, as sweet as her lips
Something special like champagne
Yeah they oughta make a brand new whiskey
And give it a woman's name
Yeah they oughta make a brand new whiskey
And give it a woman's nameDon't accuse me of being without feelings if you do you know that you're wrong
For it was you who was careless and you drove me into another's arms
The other woman isn't prettier than you
But the other woman soothes my wounded pride
And more important I feel wanted again I can't give up the other woman in my life
[ steel ]
I'm like a float in the middle of a river I can't climb out on either side
And if I go over the deep end it's because sweetheart you haven't tried
The other woman isn't prettier...Blue night I got you on my mind
Blue night I can't keep from crying
You met someone that was new
You quit someone that you knew was true
Blue night I got you on my mind
Blue night blue as I can be
I don't know what'll become of me
Where we used to walk I walk alone
With an aching heart because my love is gone
Blue night blue as I can be
Blue night 'cause I'm all alone
I used to call you on the telephone
I used to call and it made you glad
Now I call and it makes you mad
Blue night 'cause I'm all alone
Blue night all by myself
Since you put me on that shelf
There's just one thing that you must know
You're gonna reap just what you sow
Blue night, all by myself
Blue night, all by myselfShe waited for the light to torn green on me and her
She waited for me to speak those three little words
I dragged out a promise that I never made good
She waited as long as she could, and now
I'm sitting on the couch
Whiskey in my hand
Staring out the window
For one more second chance
Hoping headlights
Come pouring round the bend
Waiting, waiting, waiting
For her forgiving voice to come across the phone
Saying baby wait
Up I'm coming home
But in the sunrise
I'm still all alone
Waiting, waiting, waiting
Yeah she's running like a river after a hard rain
She's rolling free like a tumbleweed on a desert plain
I was the one she couldn'ts low down
Aw but look at me now
I'm sitting on the couch
Whiskey in my hand
Staring out the window
For one more second chance
Hoping headlights
Come pouring round the bend
Waiting, waiting, waiting
For her forgiving voice to come across the phone
Saying baby wait
Up I'm coming home
But in the sunrise
I'm still all alone
Waiting, waiting, waiting
I know I should get in my truck
Chase that girl down the hall
'Cause there ain't no winning her back
Just sitting on the couch
Whiskey in my hand
Staring out the window
For one more second chance
Hoping headlights
Come pouring round the bend
Waiting, waiting, waiting
For her forgiving voice
To come across the phone
Saying baby wait
Up I'm coming home
'Cause in the sunrise
I'm still all alone
Waiting, waiting, waiting
Whoa
WaitingSometimes I run through the woods with my pellet gun, pretend I am fighting
With the boys on Juno beach with some pinecone grenades in my red flyer wagon
And I lie awake dreaming someday I might be just like the man
With the camouflage maple leaf on his sleeve - yeah i'd be just like you dad
CHORUS
They tell me I look just like you
They say I've got your mischievous smile
They tell me someday I'll make make sense of this, each year I grow, each passing mile
They say son you walk alone now ,but they don't see what I see
I've got the footprints of a giant stretching out in front of me
There will be lonely days, days I shut out the world and just come undone
But I'll try my best to live life like you did, my days out in the sun
I'll learn about you from your best friends, laugh at the crazy things you did
And I'll walk in your steps with my little feet until someday they fit, I hope someday they fit
CHORUS
They tell me I look just like you
They say I've got your mischievous smile
They tell me someday I'll make make sense of this, each year I grow, each passing mile
And I hear that boy he is lost now, but they don't see what I see
I've got the footprints of a giant stretching out in front of me
BRIDGE
And the flag flies low, 21 guns smoke, and by thousands they say goodbye
And the guard salutes with the snap of their boots to the hero neath the red and white
There will be lonely days, days I shut out the world and just come undone
But I'll try my best to live life like you did, and fill my years with sun
And someday when you're out walkin you'll hear a voice from behind you
Sayin wait up dad and you're goin a little too fast and I'll run up to you....
...In the footprints of a giant.The sense to see and I saw you walk away the sense to feel I feel lonely everyday
The sense to hear for I heard you say goodbye
The sense to taste now I taste the tears I cry
My senses tell me all I need to know it's over and I don't have the sense to let you go
It doesn't make much sense for me to cry for you
If I had any sense at all I'd realize we're through
My senses are reacting much too slow
It's over and I don't have the sense to let you go
Oh yes it's over and I don't have the sense to let you go (it's over)Let me go with you don't leave me I'll miss you I'll love you
Now that I've kissed you I'll never forget you I know it's true
If I can only tag along I'll do it to be with you
Don't make my heart believe it's long tell me you want me too
Let me go with you don't leave me I'll miss you I'm scared of the blues
Scared of the blues
Let me go with you and I'll never let you get lonesome
Let me be near you and my love is yours when you need someone
If only to be your old standby having to share your kiss
I'd rather be than left to die craving the love I'd miss
Let me go with you don't leave me I'll miss you I'm scared of the blues
Scared of the bluesWatch how she tore me all apart
Watch how she ripped up my heart
Watch how she cut that thing clean through
Watch out she'll do the same to you
Watch how she wrecked love's hope filled train
Watch how she reveled in my shame
Watch how she learned me who was boss
It was gone before it ever went away
Got up and left before it even, really tried to stay
And any doubt that hung around, sure ain't here now
She's the best dirty trick, love's ever played
Watch how she tossed my affections 'round
Watch how she drug'em cross the ground
Watch how she claimed they're hers to use
Watch out or she'll drag yours for youAnd she likes it in the morning
And I run my fingers through her hair
And she smiles when I call her darling
She looks like a angel laying there
And she wants me in the evening
To listen close to how she feels
She needs to know I need her
And Heaven knows I always will
'Cause she loves me every single day and night
And she says we are everything that's good in her life
She says she loves me more than anything on earth
And that's almost as much as I love her
She likes to lay down on me
And rest her head on my chest
And softly whisper to me
What she won't share with anyone else
And there's a sweetness in her laughter
When it's just the two of us
And I try so hard to capture
Every little thing she does
'Cause she loves me every single day and night
And she says we are everything that's good in her life
She says she loves me more than anything on earth
And that's almost as much as I love her
And she says she loves me more than anything on earth
And that's almost, almost as much as I love her
And she likes it in the morningI checked myself in the rear-view mirror,
As I pulled out of the drive
The woman right there staring back at me
I could hardly recognise
She looked so strong and self-assured,
in a way I never was,
until I met you,
until you loved me.
There were places I thought I would never go,
things I'd never do.
The skies the limit now,
and that's all because of you.
Thank god I stopped believing in the walls I lived behind
I was blind,
Until you loved me...
[Chorus]
I didn't know I could glow like this
I never know what love is
Until I saw myself in a picture beside you
Your steady arms around me
In your eyes I can see
You make me
The woman I wanna be
I could drive right down a lonely road,
Straight into the dark
Cause you're my destination,
Baby you're my place to start
My Fear and limitations are all I leave behind
That suits me fine...
It's about time.
[Chorus]
I didn't know I could glow like this
I never know what love is
Until I saw myself in a picture beside you
Your steady arms around me
In your eyes I can see
You make me
The woman I wanna be
I didn't know I could fly so high
Now I wanna be up there with you all of the time
Cause you make me who I am,
Yeah, till you loved me
Your steady arms around me,
In your eyes I can see
You make me,
Oh baby you make me,
The woman I wanna be.
Yeah-yeahWriters: Doug Supernaw/Kenny King
I just called to say hello, I hope everything's alright
Me, I'm doin' fine, but I still can't sleep at night
I finally had a good day just last week
At least the best one since you've gone
But it kills me when I hear, "When's Mamma comin' home?"
Chorus:
And I know that there are somethings
You feel that you've been missing
I tried to be your Superman
I've done all I can
Still you feel the need to spread your wings
But darlin' if you're listening
When the world ain't all you thought it would be
You still got me
I live everyday a lie and tell the kids that it's alright
And I see alot of you in them when I tuck'em in at night
Try hard not to be too weak, for one of us must be strong
And it kills me when I'm there lyin' all aloneIt's not too late
Let me take you on a midnight drive
I might sound crazy baby
Maybe somewhere under the stars
In my car, in the dark
We can park, I don't care what we do
I just wanna see you
Dance for me, dance for me
Throw it on the floor for me
Dance for me, dance for me
Yeah come on girl
Get your hands in the air
Shake it down like you just don't care
We can do a little double dare
That's it right there, the way you
Dance for me, dance for me
The way you
Dance for me, dance for me
I'm gonna sit back baby
Sip that Jack and watch you move
It won't be long before
I'm swaying right up next to you
In the lights of the night
Burning bright
From up here on my hood
You look so damn good
When you
Dance for me, dance for me
Throw it on the floor for me
Dance for me, dance for me
Yeah come on girl
Get your hands in the air
Shake it down like you just don't care
We can do a little double dare
That's it right there, when you
Dance for me, dance for me
(Come on, come on)
When you
Dance for me, dance for me
Come on girl, let your hair down
Do a little dance for me
Come on girl, let your hair down
Do a little dance for me
I got you and the moon
And the right little tune
And you know what to do
I just wanna see you
Dance for me, dance for me
Throw it on the floor for me
Dance for me, dance for me

Get your hands in the air
Shake it down like you just don't care

Yeah, dance for me, dance for me (come on, come on)
The way you dance for me, dance for meYou ask me if I've met your baby
I have to say
It's been some time now
Seems like yesterday
He was mine
For a while
We had good times
We went in style
But now he's yours
Treat him kind
Yes I remember well when
He was mine
You say he means the world to you
Well yes I can tell
You'll make each other happy
I wish you well
He was mine
For a while
We had good times
We went in style
But now he's yours
Treat him kind
Yes I remember well when
He was mine
Yes I remember well when
He was mine
He was mine
He was mine
He was mine
He was mineI'd sing the Red River Valley
And he'd sit in the kitchen and cry
Run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
Wonder Lord has every well I drilled ran dry
We were friends me and that old man
Like desperados waiting for the train
Like desperados waiting for the train
He's a drifter and a driller of oil wells
And an old school man of the world
Taught me how to drive his car when he's too drunk to
And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives was like some old western movie
Like desperados waiting for the train
Like desperados waiting for the train
From the time that I could walk he take me with him
To a place called the Green Frog Cafe
There was old men with beer guts and dominoes
Lyin' bout their lives while they'd play
And I was just a kid that they all called his sidekick
Like desperados waiting for the train
Like desperados waiting for the train
Now I looked up and he was pushin' eighty
And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he's one of the heroes of this country
So why's he all dressed up like some old men
Drinking beer and playing moon and 42
Like desperados waiting for the train
Like desperados waiting for the train
Then just before he died I went to see him
I was grown and he was almost gone
We just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang another verse to that old song
Don't cry Jack it's only Jesus comin'
Like desperados waiting for the train
Like desperados waiting for the train
Like desperados waiting for the trainSome people talk to angels
Some people talk to themselves
I don't know who you're talking to
But everything you say makes me want you
You are a model that I see in magazines
You make me nervous
You make my heart beat
You are red in a sea of black and white
You are a fire, you are dynamite
Some people try to change the world
Some people just stay alive
I don't know what you're living for
But everything you do makes me want more
You are a model that I see in magazines
You make me nervous
You make my heart beat
You are red in a sea of black and white
You are a fire, you are dynamite
You are a model that I see in magazines
You make me nervous
You make my heart beat
You are red in a sea of black and white
You are a fire, you are dynamite
You are a fire, you are dynamite
You are a fire, you are dynamiteThe sun goes down in Calvin county
Neon lights from an old beer sign
Shown through the window out on the sidewalk
As I walked in to pass the time;
I looked around, sat down at a table
Ordered beef on rye and a glass of wine
And through the door came a little old lady
She was selling paper roses and they only cost a dime.
Paper Rosie, Paper Rosie
She sold you Paper Roses, but they only cost a dime.
Silver hair that's lost its' Gold
Trembling hand as she passed the rose
Red Crepe paper, made nature's bouquet
Help a little old lady buy a rose today;
I took the rose from her trembling hand
With eyes of age, she smiled and walked away
Like a breath of spring I could smell the rose
It came alive and I heard her say.
Buy my Roses, pretty roses
They're only made of paper
But they only cost a dime.
I went to look for her outside
A spray of roses lay by her side
The sky lit up and the choir sang
A thousand voices as the church bells rang.
They sang Rosie (Rosie), paper Rosie (Rosie)
She sold you Paper Roses
But they only cost a dime.
Paper Rosie (Rosie), Paper Rosie (Rosie)
She sold you paper roses
But they only cost a dimYour hair is soft your eyes are bright your nose is small your mouth is right
Your skin is smooth your waist is small
Your legs are curved you've got dainty feet I love it all
Head to toe can't you see I love you head to toe I can't get enough of you
I told you now you know I love you head to toe
Your sparkling eyes they shine with love your hungry lips can't get enough
Your loving arms they're clinging vines
Your body's warm and when we're close I know it's mine
Head to toe...
Head to toe...You'll be lonely with your lover
You belong to no one
You'll be lonely by yourself
You belong to no one
You can be happy with someone who loves you
You can be lonely with someone you trust
You can't just tell your heart where it should go
'cause darlin' you know
You'll only be given the tiniest chance
And it won't come back anymore
You'll be lonely when you're hollow
You belong to no one
You'll be lonely when you're dry
You belong to no one
Whether or not you've got someone who loves you
You can be lonely with someone you trust
You can't just tell your heart where it should go
'cause darlin' you know
There's only the tiniest chance
And you'll always be lonely
You'll always be lonely
You'll always be lonely
You'll always be lonely
You'll always be lonelyI love the sound of a steam train rushing through the night
The hoot of an owl the puppy dogs' growl
Thrills me with delight
I love the crunch of the crisp and the wind when it whispers down our avenue
Oh me oh my I love the things that my ears can do
Oh me oh my I love the things that my ears can do
I love the sound of a kettle singing as it warms through garden hand
And I bubble inside when trombones glide
And the grand pianos grand
Love the gurgle and plug when I pull out the plug and the water rushes through
Oh me oh my I love the things that my ears can do
Oh me oh my I love the things that my ears can do
There is treasure in the air if you listen
I you don't you never know what you are missin
I love the sound of laughter that has a drewce in love
And the purest gold is the story told by the black bird and the dove
The oceans sigh is a lullaby that is old and ever new
Oh me oh my I love the things that my ears can do
Oh me oh my I love the things that my ears can do
There is treasure in the air if you listen
If you don't you will never know what you are missin
I love the sound of a doorbell doing what a doorbell does
And old bumblebee doesn't bother me with his buzz buzz buzz
I love the pop of a champagne top and the click of a well-heeled shoe
Oh me oh my I love the things that my ears can do
Oh me oh my I love the things that my ears can doI came to see her daddy for sit down man to man
It wasn't any secret I'd be asking for her hand
I guess that's why he left me waiting in the living room by myself
With at least a dozen pictures of her sitting on a shelf
She was playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Running through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancing with her dad, looking up at him
In her eyes I'm Prince Charming
But to him I'm just some fella
Riding in and stealing Cinderella
I leaned in towards those pictures to get a better look at one
When I heard a voice behind me say "Now, ain't she something, son?"
I said "Yes, she quite a woman"
And he just stared at me
Then I realized that in his eyes she would always be
Playing Cinderella
Riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Running through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancing with her dad, looking up at him
In her eyes I'm Prince Charming
But to him I'm just some fella
Riding in and stealing Cinderella
He slapped me on the shoulder
Then he called her in the room
When she threw her arms around him
That's when I could see it too
She was playing Cinderella
Riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Running through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancing with her dad, looking up at him
If he gives me a hard time
I can't blame the fella
I'm the one who's stealing Cinderella"Hey pretty baby are you ready for me
It's your good rockin' daddy down from Tennessee
Well I'm just outta Austin bound for San Antone
With the radio blastin' and the bird dog on
There's a speed trap up ahead South of town
But no local yokel's gonna shut me down
Cause me and the boys got this rig unwound
And we've come a thousand miles from the guitar town
Nothin' ever happened round my home town
And I ain't the kind to just hang around
But I heard someone callin' my name one day
And I followed that voice down the lost highway
Everybody told me you can't get far
Now I'm smokin' into Texas with the hammer down
And a rockin' little combo from the guitar town
Hey pretty baby don't you know it ain't my fault
Love to hear the steel belts hummin' on the asphalt
Wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop
Stumble in the restaurant, wonderin' why I don't stop
Well I gotta keep rockin' while I still can
Got a two-pack habit and a motel tan
When my boots hit the boards it's a brand new hand
Put my back to the risers and make my stand
Hey pretty baby won't you hold me tight
I'm loadin' up and rollin' out of here tonight
One of these days I'm gonna settle down
And I'll take you back with me to the guitar townShe opened up the letter from Nashville Tennessee
He said hon they like my music the songs I wrote for you and me
The boys and me just cut a record and it could hit the charts before too long
So it's gonna be a while till I can come back home
Yes I'm gonna be a country star and everyone will know my name
Oh you know I love those bright lights when I step on stage to sing
I'll be travlin' round the country with a big bus and a band
So just keep the homefires burnin' while I'm gone
And I'll get home when I can
She said hon I hear your record oh they play it everyday
And everybody really likes it so I guess your on your way
But darling please remember we all need you here at home
And the kids all miss their daddy so don't be gone too long
Yes I know that your a country star and everybody knows your name
And I know you love those bright lights when you step on stage to sing
Just remember we all love you and don't get blinded by the light
We'll just keep the homefires burnin' while you're gone
You know we pray for you each night
After six long months of goin' I guess the road just finally took its toll
Cause his songs has lost all meaning and he felt so all alone
Then one night in Jackson he went out on stage to play
And the crowd stared at disbelief at the words he had to say
I don't want to be a country star it ain't the way I thought it'd be
Well it took me such a long time to know that it ain't the life for me
Cause the days can get so lonely and the nights can get so long
Lord I think it's about time this country star went home
Yes I think that it's about time this country boy went homeThe Clouds Gwine Roll Away	Doc Watson
A lightning bug just never knows just what hes about to find
But he keeps on flyin around and around with his little light on behind
CHO.
Oh the clouds gwine roll away the clouds gwine roll away
I dont care how hard it rains the clouds gwine roll away
A little bird in a gilded cage and he might have been whistlin yet
But he went out one rainy night and got his whistler wet
CHO.
Oh a jay bird spied a little worm just a wigglin to and fro
But on that spot where the worm once dwelt there aint no worm no mo

My gal said youre my little horse but I says no youre wrong
I just couldnt be no little horse cause my hair is growd too long
CHO.
The hen she first came from the egg. Then the egg came from the hen.
But I been wonderin all this time just where its goin to end.
CHO.I don't hurt anymore, all my teardrops are dried
No more walking the floor with that burning inside
Just to think it could be time has opened the door
And at last I am free I don't hurt anymore
No use to deny I wanted to die
The day you said we were through
But now that I find you're out of my mind
I can't believe that it's true
And I've forgotten somehow that I cared so before
And at last I am free, I don't hurt anymore
No use to deny I wanted to die
The day you said we were through
But now that I find you're out of my mind
I can't believe that it's trueHe'll never wear a business suit
Cowboy hats and bull hide boots just suit him fine
See that buckle shine
He won it in a rodeo
On a horse named Desperado
And he won the ride but he broke his back
Hit so hard he heard it crack
No more rodeo
But you can't keep a good man down
A line of western wear uptown heard of his fame
And they bought his name
Now he looks down from a suite
At the silver limo parked out on the street
And he's not just a face in a martini crowd
He drinks long neck Bud and gets a little loud
The mans back on his feet
He's an uptown down-home good ol boy
In a business world so fast
On a horse of a different color
But hell hang on til the last
He's still the local hero
He's the hometown pride and joy
He's an uptown down-home good ol boy
A woman loved him through it all
Through his rowdy days and his hardest fall when he almost died
She stayed by his side
She's still right there today
He wouldn't have it any other way
And he never did get too proud
To hang out with the same old crowd
Were proud to say
He's an uptown down-home good ol boy
In a business world so fast
Oh but its a different saddle
Than he once rode in the past
He's still the local hero
He's the hometown pride and joy
He's an uptown down-home good ol boy
He's an uptown down-home good ol boyKeep movin', movin', movin',
Though they're disapprovin',
Keep them dogies movin', rawhide.
Don't try to understand 'em,
Just rope 'em, throw, and brand 'em.
Soon we'll be livin' high and wide.
My heart's calculatin',
My true love will be waitin',
Be waitin' at the end of my ride.
Move 'em on, head 'em up,
Head 'em up, move 'em on,
Move 'em on, head 'em up, rawhide!
Head 'em out, ride 'em in,
Ride 'em in, let 'em out,
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in, rawhide!
The ending lyrics are:
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin',
Though the streams are swollen,
Keep them dogies rollin', rawhide.
Through rain and wind and weather,
Hell bent for leather,
Wishin' my gal was by my side.
All the things I'm missin',
Good vittles, love and kissin',
Are waiting at the end of my ride.I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
And pensively stood by his tomb,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
"How sweetly I sleep here alone.
The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar,
And gathering storms may arise,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul.
The tears are all wiped from my eyes.
The cause of my Master compelled me from home,
No kindred or relative nigh.
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
My soul flew to mansions on high.
Go tell my companion and children most dear
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
The same hand that led me through scenes most severe
Has kindly assisted me home."I start every day with a smile on my face
And the feel of a kiss on my lips
When the world plays to rough I can find the healing touch
Life's never been better than this
That's what I get for loving you
Heaven's right here in my hands
A dream that is real and a heart that beats true
That's what I get for loving you
There was a time I walked outside the lines
I only thought of myself
Then you sat me down turned my head around
Now, I put you before everything else
That's what I get for loving you
Heaven's right here in my hands
A dream that is real and a heart that beats true
That's what I get for loving you
Love is a feeling I never knew much about
Forever's a word I never said until now
That's what I get for loving you
Heaven's right here in my hands
A dream that is real and a heart that beats true
That's what I get for loving you
That's what I get for loving you
Heaven's right here in my hands
A dream that is real and a heart that beats true
That's what I get for loving youThe wind is blowing 'cross the mountains
And out on the valley way below
It sweeps the grave of my darling
When I die that's where I want to go
Lord, send the angels for my darling
And take her to that home on high
I'll wait my time out here on earth love
And come to you when I die
Our names are carved upon the tombstone
I promised you before you died
Our love will bloom forever, darling
When we rest side by side
I hear a voice out in the darkness
It moans and whispers through the pines
I know it's my sweetheart a calling
I hear her through the walls of timeYou're a red string tied to my finger
A little love letter I carry with me
You're sun light, smoke rings and cigarettes
Old lines and kisses from silver screens
Oh dear, never saw you coming
Oh my, look what you have done
You're my favorite song
Always on the tip of my tongue
You own me with whispers like poetry
Your mouth is a melody that I've memorized
So sweet, I hear it echo
Everywhere I go day and night
Oh dear, never saw you coming
Oh my, look what you have done
You're my favorite song
Always on the tip of my tongue
The tip of my tongue
Oh dear, never saw you coming
Oh my, look what you have done
You're my favorite song
Always on
Oh dear, never saw you coming
Oh my, look what you have done
You're my favorite song
Always on the tip of my tongueI must've been fooled when you touched my heart
Skies were red and blazing
I heard a moan in the elms above
And I knew the day was ending
I knew you'd seen your happiest day
When the next morn the birds were singing
We felt the same cold from the earth
It took the moon to hold the tide
And set our hearts a spinning
You'd wait for dark never come again
I'll turn my back to the calling sun
If you'll rise and meet me
I'll walk the road I took from you
Oh, stay a while and the red sky is blazing
Touch my heart and feel my burning
For the day you left
For the arms above
To me, those birds are singingYeah, she's the one
The one I told you all about
Yeah, it was serious, but it was long ago
She just might walk over here
And give me a kiss for old times
But don't you worry, dear
Old times, next to you, can never come close
[Chorus]
I'll take today over yesterday, anyday
I'll take lyin' in your arms tonight
Over and above any love I've known
Memories may find me, but they'll always be behind me
I'll take today over yesterday, anyday
I'd be lyin' if I tried to tell you now
That I never loved her
And she doesn't ever cross my mind
But that was yesterday, and baby, I don't want to go back
Here is where I'm gonna stay
With you in each tomorrow of my life
[Chorus]While I was out a ridin'
The grave yard shift, midnight 'til dawn
The moon was bright as a readin' light
For a letter from an old friend back home
And he asked me
Why do you ride for your money
and why do you rope for short pay
You ain't a'gettin' nowhere
And you're loosin' your share
Boy, you must have gone crazy out there
He said last night he runn in to Jenny
She's married and has a good life
And boy you sure missed the track
When you never come back
She's the perfect professional's wife
And she asked him
Why does he ride for his money
And tell me why does he rope for short pay
He ain't a'gettin' nowhere
And he's loosin' his share
Well he must've gone crazy out there
Ah but they've never seen the Northern Lights
They ain't never seen a hawk on the wing
They've never spent spring on the Great Divide
And they've never heard ole' camp cookie sing
Well I read up the last of my letter
And tore off the stamp for black Jim
And when Billy rode up to relieve me
He just looked at my letter and grinned
He said you know I wonder
Why do they ride for their money
Tell me why do they ride for short pay
They ain't a'gettin' nowhere
And they're loosin' their share
Son, they all must be crazy out there
They ain't never seen the Northern Lights
They ain't never seen a hawk on the wing
They've never spent spring on the Great Divide
And they've never heard ole' camp cookie singJUST OVER IN THE GLORYLAND

I can see in your eyes
I know how you feel
We've been together
Too long to conceal
What's in our hearts
Maybe we should part
But after so many years
That would only bring loneliness
Sorrow and tears
And anyway...
I never would
Never could
Never will ever kill what's between us
So let's try again
We'll start a brand new dance
Between old friends
There will always be days
When it don't seem to pay
When it just doesn't rhyme
Well, that's bound to happen
Some of the time
Our best days aren't gone
We don't need to move on
Well, maybe we should try
But I don't think you could take it
And neither could I
And anyway...
I never would
Never could
Never will ever kill what's between us
So let's try again
We'll start a brand new dance
Between old friends
Darlin' come here
Love's not disappeared
You're just feelin' low
Well, let me tell you my darlin'
That's a feelin' I know
It don't mean too much
We just got out of touch
Well, it's easy to change
'Cause lovin' you's not too hard to arrange
And anyway...
I never would
Never could
Never will ever kill what's between us
So let's try again
We'll start a brand new dance
Between old friends
We'll start a brand new dance
Between old friends
Yes, we'll start a brand new dance
Between old friendsI saw the sun set low on that skyline
Day was gone I was out of time
As I let her walk out and say goodbye
And I sat there on that street askin' why
I let her drive away....
I let her drive away....
She walked out that door threw that truck in gear
I'm standing there alone drowning in my tears
Watched the tailights as they disappeared
She was gone like I'd always feared
As I let her drive away....
I let her drive away......
I sometimes think about her and what we had
Everything about us was not that bad
Wish I had done things different then she'd have stayed
But I let her drive away.......
But I let her drive away.......
Every time I look back I can almost see
That mountain of regret overcoming me
That night she left stays in my memory
I never thought she would ever leave
And drive away.......
I let her drive away.....
I sometimes think about her and what we had
Everything about us was not that bad
Wish I had done things different then she'd have stayed
But I let her drive away.......
I let her drive away......
I sometimes think about her and what we had
Everything about us was not that bad
Wish I had done things different then she'd have stayed
But I let her drive away......
I let her drive away.......
I let her drive away.......Whose memory are you who's all alone and blue
Dreamin' of your kiss so warm and sweet
Whose memory are you who cries the whole night through
Whose heart is lying broken at your feet
It doesn't seem to worry you that's why I'm so afraid
For I might fall and I might make the same mistake he's made
So I'll go on alone my heart will be my own
The life I'm living now will have to do
But please before you go one thing I'd like to know
Please tell me dear whose memory are you
[ steel - piano ]
It doesn't seem to worry you...Born to lose I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose it seems so hard to bear
How I long to always have you near
You've grown tired and now you say we're through
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose my every hope is gone
It's so hard to face an empty dawn
You were all the happiness I knew
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
There's no use to dream of happiness
All I see is only loneliness
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose and now I'm losing you(Now and then there's a fool such as I)
Pardon me, if I'm sentimental
When we say goodbye
Don't be angry with me should I cry
When you're gone, yet I'll dream
A little dream as years go by
Now and then there's a fool such as I
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now
You say that we are through
I'm a fool, but I'll love you dear
Until the day I die
Now and then there's a fool such as I
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love
And now you say that we are through
I'm a fool, but I'll love you dear
Until the day I die
Now and then there's a fool such as I
Now and then there's a fool such as I
Now and then there's a fool such as ILove can go to your head
Like a shot of something strong
Love can go to your bed
And stay there all night long
Love can go on and on
Like a Sunday morning Sparrow
Love can go to your heart
Like a sweet-talking arrow
Love can go to hell
In a broken heartbeat minute
That's where I am without you in it
Every day is just another night by myself
Love can go to hell
Like roses in a vase of whiskey
Dying for the way you used to kiss me
Heaven knows I only wish you well
Oh, but love, yeah love
Can go to hell
I can go to church
And fold these idle hands
I can go to work
Call some friends
Make some plans
I can get drunk on a Saturday night
And try to fall for someone new
But I'd just wake up hungover
Cursing the day I feel for you
Love can go to hell
In a broken heartbeat minute
That's where I am without you in it
Every day is just another night by myself
Love can go to hell
Like roses in a vase of whiskey
Dying for the way you used to kiss me
Heaven knows I only wish you well
I don't blame you at all
No, I don't hate you at all
It's all love's fault
So, love can go to hell
In a broken heartbeat minute
That's where I am without you in it
Every day is just another night by myself
Love can go to hell
Like roses in a vase of whiskey
Dying for the way you used to kiss me
Heaven knows I only wish you well
Oh, but love, yeah love
Can go to hell
Forever's just a lie that love will tell
So love
Yeah love can go to hellWell good evening everybody and welcome to this full throttle thrill show that is world series sprint cars, well folks they've come from far and wide for this one, three of the best that uncle sam could slam down and some fearless aussies get ready to get it on, we're about to go hot lappin', the track is in excellent shape, you're about to feel the ground pound folks as we get ready to rack 'em and stack 'em for hot laps

Where they've been or where they're going
I'm not one but I know some
I've been selfish with affection
I threw it all in one direction
To turn around and then I found
The ones I loved I'd let 'em down
There must be a guardian angel
I lived my life like no tomorrow
A lot of laughs and such sweet sorrow
But most the time I took for granted
And heaven knows somebody planned it
There must be someone watching over me
A guardian angel guiding me
A guardian angel just for me
About the company I'm keeping
I slipped away while they were sleeping
I kissed the boys and made them cry
Oh I never stopped to say good-bye
Some folks live their life not knowing
Where they've been or where they're going
I've been up to living it down
And heaven knows I know how now
There must be someone watching over me
A guardian angel guiding me
A guardian angel just for me
A guardian angel watching me
A guardian angel just for me
A guardian angel...Shes a wild girl but that's alright
Because she's living in a wild world
And she's kinda like the queen bee
Swimming in cola like a strange bird
You don't want to get close to
Yea, she's a strange bird and I should know
Because I thought I'd heard an angel
From down the road but it was you, girl
Climbing up a tree and you were howling
I thought I heard you singing
I'm a princess and I'm a thief
I'll make you laugh and leave you grief
Pay your ticket and get your keys
'Cause I'm bored and I, I wanna go home
I'm bored and I, I wanna go home
She is a wild one but that's okay
Because she's living in a wild world
Where I'm the fly and she's the spider
Fighting in and out beneath your collar
I thought I heard her singingIt wasn't easy and I know it,
You'd been alone much too long,
I had a job places to go,
But I'd rather be right here at home,
He had the time he could give you,
When your lips could never find mine,
And our little home was payin' the price,
Of love left on the vine,
Forgiveness is something,
I guess it comes with time,
But even at best,
There's one thing I know,
I'll forgive but I'll never forget,
I guess when it's over it's over,
And your time is no longer mine,
But I never meant to cause all the pain,
I just wanted your love for mine,
And forgiveness is something,
I guess it comes with time,
But even at best,
There's one thing I know,
I'll forgive but I'll never forget,I just don't understand why things keep hanging on
You're gone why don't your mem'ry leave me alone
I'm doing all the things they say to do but I don't get no better without you
I just know the one who said things get better with time
Didn't have the kind of love I have for you
The only thing that time has done is gone and out of my mind
Cause I don't get no better without you
[ fiddle ]
I just know the one who said...
No I don't get no better without youIn your eyes I can see you really don't believe it's you I'm holdin' in my arms
Cause I've known you all your life
You've never been the kind of woman to do wrong
And I know you havenm't changed and I know you still wear his name
And you're still the lady that I always knew
But you look so sad and lonely
Just close your eyes and hold me ladies get lonesome too
I know you're a good woman and you try to be a good wife
But I also know that you've had to spend too much time alone
And all the life has held you is faded dreams and songs sung blue
And a love that can't go right for goin' wrong
You've still got your pride but baby pride can't hold you
Or keep you warm the way that I can do
You've always been a lady but tinight be just my baby
Cause ladies get lonesome too
You've always been a lady but tonight just lay back and be my baby
Cause ladies get lonesome tooWay up in the north in old Tyrone
There's a pretty little girl I call my own
She's the sweetest rose Ireland's ever grown
And sure as the moon and stars above
I'm falling head over heels in love
With a pretty little girl from Omagh
In the county of Tyrone.
There's cute little girls in old Strabane
They're just as pretty in Monaghan
This to every roving eye is known
But I guess that I'd be out of bounds
'Cos there between the northern towns
There's a pretty little girl from Omagh
In the county of Tyrone.
She wears my ring and tells her friends
She going to marry me
Best of all she tells them all
She's going to marry me, oh lucky me.
Well I don't know what she's done to me
There's nothing else my eyes can see
My pretty little girl from Omagh
In the county of Tyrone.
--- Instrumental ---
T'was down in south in old Tramore
I recall the yellow dress she wore
She strolled along the shore there all alone
But I guess it was my lucky day
When she came there on holiday
My pretty little girl from Omagh
In the county of Tyrone.
She wears my ring and tells her friends
She going to marry me
Best of all she tells them all
She's going to marry me, oh lucky me.
Well, I don't know what she's done to me
There's nothing else my eyes can see
My pretty little girl from Omagh
In the county of Tyrone.
My pretty little girl from Omagh
In the county of Tyrone...I signed the paper, she signed below me
The judge said, "Married", she said, "Hold me"
Church bells started, as we departed
Straight into life we sailed just like a fairy tale
Hopefully heartache
I signed the paper, she signed beside me
The bank said, "Good luck", she said, "Provide me"
I gave it all I had, still it turned out bad
Little games of cat and mouse
And simply playing house, ain't that sad?
Pitty all the puzzle, didn't fit
It wasn't me, it wasn't her
It was life, that somehow up and quit
I signed the paper, she signed without me
The judge said, "Over" as darkness found me
Standing on the street while lying with my feet
All our dreams and plans, nothing in my hands
Except the paperWell, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,
Two lovers and I love them both the same.
Let me tell you 'bout my first lover.
He's sweet and kind and he's mine all mine.
He treats me good like a lover should and makes me love him,
I really, really love him,
Oh, I love him so,
And I'll do ev'rything I can to let him know.
Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,
Two lovers and I love them both the same.
Let me tell you 'bout my other lover.
He treats me bad, makes me sad,
Makes me cry but sill I can't deny that I love him,
I really, really love him,
Oh I love him so,
And I'll do ev'rything I can to let him know.
Darling, Well, Don'tcha know that I can tell whenever I look at you,
That you think that I'm untrue,
'Cause I said that I love two,
But I really, really do.
'Cause you're a split personality.
And in reality, both of them are you.
Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,
Two lovers and I love them both the same.
Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,
Two lovers and I love them both the same.
Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,We were waltzin' that night in Kentucky
By that beautiful harvest moon
And I was a boy that was lucky
But it all ended too soon
As I sit here alone in the moonlight
I see your smiling face
And I long once more for your embrace
And that beautiful Kentucky Waltz
[ steel ]
We were waltzin' that night in Kentucky...Parked down on lover's leap
Steaming up his old heap
Two lovers stare up at the stars
Somewhere in the lights below
Two houses all aglow
Parents wondering where on earth they are
'Cause their folks have tried to tell them
This is way too serious
And while their mommas are waiting up they're
Holdin', lovin', kissin', huggin'
Come whatever may they keep
Goin', dreamin', smilin', believin'
That nothin' matters like this love they're holdin'
A few years and some wedding vows
A quarter-acre and a little white house
More than they can well afford
And those easy payments are getting tough
All the overtime ain't enough
Still they couldn't ask for more
'Cause that old hill that they've been climbin'
Might be gettin' steep
Oh, but they don't seem to mind it they keep
Holdin', lovin', kissin', huggin'
Come whatever may they keep
Goin', dreamin', smilin', believin'
That nothin' matters like this love they're holdin'Somewhere between me and you
I love you so much I can't let you go and sometimes I believe you love me
But somewhere between your heart and mine there's a door without any key
Somewhere between your heart and mine there's a window that I can't see through
There's a wall so high it reaches the sky somewhere between me and you
[ piano ]
Somewhere between your heart and mine there's a love I can't understand
It's there for a while then it fades like a smile and I'm left in the middle again
Somewhere between...I will wake up tomorrow
I have tended to God's small song
And to Love's small song
And closed my eyes to sleep so long
And tonight I'll go
Into all of the places that you love
That is my place here
To have been in those
I will wake up tomorrow
I have amended some of the things
That some actions bring
And closed the head to be with you
In each eye there is an apple
Buried there before the eye
And out of sockets come the branches
And from the branches dangle IStanding standing standing on the promises of God my Saviour
Standing standing I'm standing on the promises of God
Standing on the promises of Christ my King
Through eternal ages let his praises ring
Glory in the highes I will shout and sing standing on the promises of God
Standing standing..
[ guitar ]
Standing on the promises that cannot fail
When the howling storm of doubt and fear and assail
By the living word of God I shall prevail standing on the promises of God
Standing standing...If to love you is forbidden
Then I'll just have to break the rules
And if our love must be hidden
Then we'll still be together
Because Those fools
Won't stop us meeting heart to heart
Can't stop a beating heart to heart
There's no weapon could deter me
No I won't stop at anything
One more threat it wouldn't acre me
'cause I'm only living for one thing
Won't stop us meeting heart to heart
Can't stop a beating heart to heart
Together we'll still be with each other
Forever just waiting for each other
Together forever
In the morning she awakens
She breaks down and cry 'cause her only
Heart had been taken
And she rather die than live apart
Won't stop us meeting heart to heart
Can't stop a beating heart to heartWell I love to wander on a sandy shore
And I love to wander down the streets of towns I've never been before
Take me somewhere out of reach lie in unfamiliar sheets
And hear the ocean roar ask for more I could not do just as long as you're there too
Just as long as I have you I'll go anywhere
Just as long as you're there too I don't really care
I'll go anywhere you want cause with you's where I belong
I've just got to have you to make my life complete
I've just got to have you there to be a part of everything I see
In the windows I walk past in the mirror in the morning in my photographs
In the candlelight cafes let me always see your face
And oh it really doesn't matter just where the road leads
To the top of a mountain or down to the sea
Just as long as I have you...
Just as long as I have just as long as I haveI'm back on the street again
Got to stand on my own two feet again
I'm walking that lonely beat again
Remembering when, whoa, whoa, remembering when
Got a tear in my eye again
To remind me that I might cry again
Feeling sad and wondering why again
Remembering when, whoa, whoa, remembering when
I remember a time when I thought the world was mine
The world belongs to somebody else now
And I'm just standing in line
So I'm thinking of me again
That's the way it?s got to be again
I?ll wait and I?ll see till then
Remembering when, whoa, whoa, remembering when
I remember a time when I thought the world was mine
The world belongs to somebody else now
And I'm just standing in line
So I'm thinking of me again
That's the way it?s got to be again
I?ll wait and I?ll see till then
Remembering when, whoa, whoa, remembering when
Whoa, whoa, remembering whenYour phone call took me by surprise
Gee its been a long, long time
Since those hot and humid Texas nights
We went swimmin' in the tide
Corpus Cristi seems so far away
And I'm not talkin' 'bout the miles
There ain't much I wouldn't give today
Just to see one of your smiles
But I'm stuck here in Denver
Sippin' California wine
And I've got all night to remember you
I'm in a lone star state of mind
I just saw John Wayne on the late, late show
He saved the girl and rode away
But I was hopin' as the credits rolled
He'd make it back to her some day
An' its a thousand miles or more
From here to your front door
Oh, I'd be there tomorrow if I had my way
Well, I'd jus' pack up my guitar
You know its really not that far
And when you called you said I'd have a place to stayEvery night I go out somebody asks me whatever happened to you
I just say that I haven't seen you lately and then I say my friend I thought you knew
That we split the blanket down the middle cause we could never get along
We split the blanket down the middle that's all you can do when love is gone
Well I tell 'em that we tried and tried to make it
But we couldn't solve what was the use
To hang on to love it's only mis'ry so now I'm fancy free and foot loose
Yes we split the blanketOur Darlin' wandered far away while she was out at play
Lost in the woods she couldn't hear a sound
She was our darlin' girl the sweetest thing in all the world
We searched for her but she couldn't be found
I heard the screams of our little girl far away
Hurry daddy there's an awful dreadful snake
I ran as fast as I could through the dark and dreary wood
But I reached our darlin' girl too late
Oh I began to sigh I knew that soon she'd have to die
For the snake was warnin' me close by
I held her close to my face she said Daddy kill that snake
It's gettin' dark tell Mommy goodbye
To all parents I must say don't let your children stray away
They need your love to guide them along
Oh God I pray we'll see out darlin' some day
It seems I still can hear her voice around our homeI saw mom with God last night
I was mad when God took you from me but last night I could plainly see
That he saved you from lots of misery
A smile upon your face told me you were happy as you could be
I'm a gonna ask God if he'll save a place for me
Mother dear sweet precious mother mother (sweet precious mother)
I saw you with God last night
He was holding to your hand showin' you around in the Promised Land
I saw you with God last night
[ dobro ]
Gonna write two letters to the heaven's blue one to God and one to you
I'm a gonna thank him for bein' so nice to you
I've been cryin' since you went away but not one tear I've shed today
Cause I know now you're happy up there in the heaven's blue
Mother dear sweet precious mother...I can't believe that after all this time
You keep slipping back across my mind
Did we maybe leave a love behind
Afraid of what we felt
Other loves I've had have come and gone
I don't know why they just don't last too long
There are questions that go on and on
That time won't tell
Time won't tell me how it might have been
Time won't make what's wrong alright
It can only take me back again
And re-run all those memories in black and white
I watch us kiss goodbye that day
Here's where you turned around and walked away
What were the words that would have made you stay
Time won't tell
You never see the road you didn't take
You never feel the love you fail to make
To never know may be the worst mistake
Cause time won't tell
No, time won't tell...Well, if you got a Cadillac, boy,
And a forty room shack, boy.
A bucket full of money,
And a tree full of honey.
But if you gettin' no huggin',
No smoochin', or a muggin'.
Well, if you ain't lovin',
Then you ain't livin'.
Well, if you're ridin' on the gravy train,
Instead of walkin' down lovers lane.
You can't make hay, boy;
You're goin' the wrong way, boy.
You gotta get a little honey,
For it's better than money.
Well, if you ain't lovin',
Then you ain't livin'.
Well, if they call you a big, big man,
'Cause you got a lot of bottom land.
If you're kin to the president,
And if you help run the government.
But if you get no attention,
You better off on a pension.
For if you ain't lovin',
Then you ain't livin'.
Well, if you got a string of long, long cars,
And you're smokin' them four-bit cigars.
Well, you ain't so well to do,
Unless you get a little coochy-coo.
It takes a little of smackin',
Or your life is a lackin'.
Well, if you ain't lovin',
Then you ain't livin'...I stood by while you flirted with my friends
I held my tongue while you kicked me on my shins
But this morning I found a strange necktie on the floor board of our car
Someday you'll push me a little bit too far
I'll forgive you this time but don't ever let it happen again
Some day you're gonna push me just a little bit too far ah of course you did not
Well you thought I'd be working all night long
You had the nerve to bring your boyfriend in our home
And now that I have found out what kind of wife you are
Some day you'll push me a little bit too far
Do what oh you want us to go up to our favorite spot on the mountain and make up
Make up after what you've done to me
Well honey I'm just like putty in your hands
Okay come on let's broke the mountain yeah up the mountain
Drive all way to top honey here we are
It's like old times just bein' here with you
Honey come a little closer over here that's it now you can get a better view yeah
You say you'll never cheat again ah ah you don't know how right you are
Cause now I've pushed you a little bit too farOh no don't start me fallin' in love again
I'm tryin' to recover from the lovin' that I had the last time
Oh no don't start me wishin' on start again
I'm too serious to huddle and cuddle just for pass time
You're sweet you're thrillin' but I think I'd rather don't touch
If I hold you like I'm wantin' to I might love you a little too much
Oh no I just can't hurt again can't you see
I'm afraid I wanna keep you if I kiss you tenderly
And I know you're not in love with me
Oh no I've seen you playin' that love before
You love 'em and deceive 'em and you leave 'em and you think you're clever
Oh no don't tempt my lonely heart anymore
I never could resist you if I kissed you I'd be lost forever
You're mean to tease me you're set all cookin' my goose
I know if I ever hold you near or have I hard time turnin' you lose
Oh no I just can't hurt again can't you see
I'm afraid I wanna keep you if I kiss you tenderly
And I know you're not in love with me

Left her back in Tennessee
Now, there's a thousand miles between
I'm going out of my head
But I can't take back the words I said
Just to fill her empty bed
Said you can drag me back to Nashville
But you'll drag me back to Nashville dead
She wanted nothing more in her life than to see her name in lights
So, I came along for the ride but there was just no end
To the smoky bars and unpaid rent, day job blues held by a thread
Oh, you can drag me back to Nashville
But you'll drag me back to Nashville dead
North Dakota boy in Tennessee
That singing town had got the best of me
Oh yeah, and I lost my love to the dream
Looking back I lost a part of me and so I said
You can drag me back to Nashville
But you'll drag me back to Nashville dead
I say, how could this be
North Dakota boy in Tennessee
That singing town had got the best of me
Oh yeah, and I lost my love to the dream
Looking back I lost a part of me and so I said
You can drag me back to Nashville
But you'll drag me back to Nashville dead
Oh, you can drag me back to Nashville
But you'll drag me back to Nashville dead
North Dakota boy in Tennessee
I say, how could this be
North Dakota boy in TennesseeSo upset
Nervous wreck
I can't believe you said goodbye
Sit and smoke
Cry and joke
About these tears in my eyes
How could you do what you've gone and done to me
I wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated me
But that's what I get
I've come to expect it from you
A million times
A million lines
And I've bought 'em, every one
You don't care
You rip and tear
Every dream I've counted on
I guess that I should thank my unlucky stars
That I'm alive and you're the way you are
But that's what I get
I've come to expect it from you
How could you do what you've gone and done to me
I wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated me
But that's what I get
I've come to expect it from you
I could raise hell
But what the hell
It wouldn't do a bit a good
Pack and leave
My heart agrees
It seems to think that I should
There won't be no more next time doing me wrong
You'll come back this time to find out that I'm gone
But that's what you get
You should expect that from me
That's what I get
I've come to expect it from youI never liked the rain until I walked through it with you
Every thunder cloud that came was one more I might not get through
On the darkest day there's always light and now I see it too
But I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you
I hear it falling in the night and filling up my mind
All the heaven's rivers come to light I see it all unwind
I hear it talking through the trees and on the window pane
When I hear it I just can't believe I never liked the rain
Like the rain I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain always calling for you I'm falling for you now
Just like the rain
When the cloud is rolling over thunder striking me
It's as bright as lightning and I wonder why I couldn't see
That it's always good and the flood is gone we still remain
Guess I've known all along I just belong here with you falling
Like the rain I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain always calling for you, I'm falling for you now
Just like the rain I have fallen for
I'm falling for you now just like the rain
And when the night falls on our better days
And we're looking to the sky
For te winds to take us high above the plains
I know that we'll find better ways to look into the eye
Of the storms that will be calling
Forever we'll be falling
Like the rain I have fallen for you, and I know just why you
Like the rain always calling for you, I'm falling for you now just
Like the rain I have fallen for you, and I know just why you
Like the rain always calling for you, I'm falling for you now just
Like the rain I have fallen for you, and I know just why you
Like the rain always calling for you, I'm falling for you now just
Like the rainIf you've gone, made up your mind 'bout leaving tomorrow
Take it all but leave my cutting board behind
I can see my way ahead, I reach this closed doorway
Try as I might I can't find my way behind
If you've gone, made up your mind 'bout leaving tomorrow
Take it all but leave my cutting board behind
I can see my way ahead, I reach this closed doorway
Try as I might I can't find my way behind
Do you see the end of time or a new level?
Next time alone we'll leave the others behind
If you've gone, made up your mind 'bout leaving tomorrow
Take it all but leave my cutting board behind
Take it all but leave my cutting board behind
Take it all but leave my cutting board behind
Take it all, yeah, take it all
Take it all but leave my cutting board behindAll alone, I didn't like the feeling
All alone, I sat and cried
All alone, I had to find some meaning
In the center of the pain I felt inside
All alone, I came into the world
All alone, I will someday die
Solid stone is just sand and water, baby
Sand and water, and a million years gone by
I will see you in the light of a thousand suns
I will hear you in the sound of the waves
I will know you when I come, as we all will come,
Through the doors, beyond the grave
All alone, I heal this heart of sorrow
All alone, I raise this child
Flesh and bone, he's just
Bursting towards tomorrow
And his laughter fills my world, and wears your smileSunset in New Mexico
Will steal your breath away
Mountains wear a cloak of gold
As twilight claims the day
Enchantment fills the sacred land
Where ancient mysteries began
And fire dances in the sky
When spirits walk upon the wind
Ancestors call
You'll hear their whispers like a sigh
They'll touch your soul
As evening sings its lullaby
You'll feel the desert come alive
Its wonders never end
When fire dances in the sky
And spirits walk upon the wind
Coyotes cry and eagles scream
As night things leave their nest
Nature paints with brilliant hues
As she puts the sun to rest
Moon and stars wait patiently
To weave their magic spell again
When fire dances in the sky
And spirits walk upon the wind
Ancestors call
You'll hear their whispers like a sigh
They'll touch your soul
As evening sings its lullaby
You'll feel the desert come alive
Its wonders never end
When fire dances in the sky
And spirits walk upon the wind
When fire dances in the sky
And spirits walk upon the windWait'll I get you down on the farm?
For a little fresh air and these lovin' arms
City lights made your heart so tough
You just haven't been loved enough
Country girls got a way of their own
Know how to love till the cows come home and then some
And then some moon will shine
And then some stars will find you
Feelin' like you never felt before
And then city boy, you'll see
How sweet love is gonna be
'Cause you'll be in some and then some
When I get you way out here
We'll take a little ride on the old John Deere
Stop by the creek where the corn grows tall
You won't wanna go back at all
Country girls got a mind of their own
Wanna be loved till the cows come home and then some
And then some moon will shine
And then some stars will find you
Feelin' like you never felt before
And then city boy, you'll see
How sweet love is gonna be
'Cause you'll be in some and then some
And then some
And then some moon will shine
And then some stars will find you
Feelin' like you never felt before
And then city boy, you'll see
How sweet love is gonna be
'Cause you'll be in some and then someOnce I had a heart cold as ice love to me was only for fun
I'd make a mark for each broken heart
Like notches on the butt of a gun
Once I had a trick up my sleeve and a reputation all over town
I was heartless and cold wherever I'd go
I shot down every young girl I found
Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit I used to be a heartbreak kid
Then I met you and the next thing I knew
There I was oh shot full of love
Now who'd have thought that someone like you could take a desperado like me
But oh here I am I'm as meek as a lamb
With my bleeding heart there at your feet
Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit
Yes I used to be a moonlight banditWhen I found you darling then he saw his big mistake
Saw what he was losin' felt his heart begin to break
Please don't let him talk you bout the way he's done before
Why he's had a hundred chances he don't deserve you anymore
Let his eyes do the crying let his feet walk the floor
Let his heart do the breaking like he's let yours break before
Let his lips do the sighing let his heartaches start to sore
Let his arms do the aching he don't deserve you anymore
[ steel ]
He took you for granted and he only brought you shame
It was never his intention to let you share his name
The lonely hours you've waited now won't happen anymore
For it's his turn to feel the hurt he don't deserve you anymore
Let his eyes do the crying...Here I go again, I'm caught in a trance
All you brothers and sisters
Join in the dance
Life is a mystery and love is the chance
It's dying to take
thought I heard forever
Now I hear better
And I know somehow some way
I'm gonna be free
One day, I'm gonna feel like I'm feelin' right now
If it was up to me
I'd wake up every morning laughin' out loud
I'd be startin' all over
When will the devil stop draggin' me down
How about now
what are we waitin' for?
We're all runnin' in place
Hell's finally frozen over and
I'm putting on skates, I made my mind up
Misery won't be my fate from this moment on
I've been good at drivin', just not arrivin'
But that's so about to change
I'm gonna be free
One day I'm gonna feel like I'm feelin' right now
If it was up to me
I'd wake up every morning laughin' out loud
I'd be startin' all over
When will the devil stop draggin' me down
How about now?
Oh it's all too easy
The next time she sees me
I'll just smile and walk away
I'm gonna be free
One day I'm gonna feel like I'm feelin' right now
If it was up to me
I'd wake up every morning laughin' out loud
I'd be startin' all over
When will the devil stop draggin' me down
How about now?My daddy was a brakeman on a highball traveling train
Mama she raised four little children and the family had a good name
And papa and mama wanted all for us they never had
Big brother little brother sister too none of them turned out half bad
'Cept me I'm the black sheep of the family
Big brother went to college and became a doctor man
I guess he makes about a million dollars a year off the folks on insurance plan
He's got a big long Mercedes Benz and a house overlooking the town
He sits in his Jacuzzi and he watches the sun go down
And he feels real sorry for me I'm the black sheep of the family
Yeah I drive me a big ol' semi truck I'm makin' payments on a two room shack
My wife she waits on tables and at night she rubs my back
And I tell her what my papa said to my mama when he got off a highball train
Wake me up early be good to my dogs and teach my children to pray
Little sister married a banker yeah he owns a country club
He bought her a big ol' racing horse and a funny lookin' little dog
He buys her big rings and diamonds and a brand new Japanese yacht
They like to get together and talk about all the things they've got
But they never mention me I'm the black sheep of the familyPlastic black frame glasses, and hair back in a bun
From 9 to 5 she looks just like a school librarian
But mister come this Friday when she's punchin' out
She's ready for love, the hem comes up, and the hair comes tumblin down
[Chorus]
When she's good she's good
When she's bad she's better
Looks like Hollywood packed inside that sweater
Love me pumps and Latin Leather
When she's good she's good
But when she's bad she's better
(B-be	-be	bad 2nd time only)
She's got a classic custom mustang
Black top love machine
Factory paint, liscense plate says '77 queen
Weavin' through the traffic
Like she ain't afraid to crash
Zepplin' on the A train
Thunder on the dash
[Chorus]
Come Monday she's all business far as anyone can see
She walks the line, dots her I's, and crosses all her t's
Everybody thinks that she's too uptight to be true
When all along she's sittin' on that
Blood Red Rose tattoo
[Chorus]
Love me pumps, and Latin leather
When she's good she's good
When she's bad she's so much better
Oh when she's bad, she's so bad bad bad
She badOoh, but love was just so hard to find
'Til you came along into my life
And then I thought I would lose my mind
When you said that you wanted to be mine
And ever since that day I've been hooked
Nothin' can turn me away
This livin' with you is like a dream come true
And it grows more and more everyday
Ooh, I'm reachin' the highest of highs
Every time I look into your eyes
You ask how I feel, I can say it out loud
I feel like a million inside
I never thought this could happen to me
You got me just where you wanted me, baby
And for your love I would do anything
Every night I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool and I can't get enough
Drivin' home from this sleepy old town
When my day's work is all through
The sun and the lights, well, I wish I could fly
To get back faster to you
I waited all day by the telephone
Starin' at the clock on the wall
The hours are so long when you're free from my arms
And I just can't wait to hold you
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool and I can't get enough
Ooh, you're givin' me chills up my spine
I'm feelin' so fine, goin' out of my mind
And I don't care if it never stops
I'll love you right up until I drop
You know I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool, fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool and I can't get enough
'Cause I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool, I'm a fool, I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool and I can't get enough
For I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your loveI'm looking for that Lonely Street
I've got a sad sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep
Where's this place called Lonely Street
A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Where's this place called Lonely Street
Perhaps upon that Lonely Street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love die
A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Where's this place called Lonely StreetIm glad you got it, yeah thats good
You wanna know how to thank me
And you probably should
You can take a minute to get me on the phone
Send a certified letter stamp it and its gone
But if you wanna do it right
You can take all night
To say I like it
... somehow I knew
That youd appreciate the gesture
And I bet you do
You can pick out something from the jewelry store
Have a dozen red roses waiting at my door
But if you wanna do it right
You can take all night
To say I like it
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
You can do this how you like
But no, no, no, no, no, no
I would rather do it right
7 money bunny, she dont want nothing
But your heart, soul
Better go, tell me what youre waiting for
[Guitar solo]
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
You can do this so polite, yeah
But no, no, no, no, no, no
I would rather do it right
All Im asking is keep it to yourself
If I really need you happy come and ring my bell
But if you wanna do it right
You can take all night
To say I like it
If you wanna do it right
You can take all night
To say I like it.LOVE TAKES A LONG TIME TO DIE
Writer Geoffrey Morgan
It's not over when you stop crying and it's the end when you say goodbye
And it's not finally done when you just walk away from someone
Cause love takes a long time it takes such a long time to die
There'll be times when you're alone you'll softly speak her name
Each one's just about left you one time
Daydreaming through the glass you'll see pictures from the past
Cause love takes a long time it takes such a long time to die
It's so hard to shut the door when mem'ries won't stay behind
They'll come around to remind you there's love still locked inside
So it's not over when you stop crying...I know that I hurt you and I'm confessing
Since you've been gone I'm feeling mighty low
Please let me hear from you and keep me guessing
I need you more than you could ever know
Now I'm to blame I treated you unkind
I broke your heart and now you're breaking mine
I know I done you wrong and I'm confessing
Please take me back and try me one more time
[ fiddle - dobro ]
How could I ever think I'll love another the way I treated you it was a crime
You are the only one I love no other please take me back and try me one more time
Now I'm to blame...I can hear my Saviour calling I can hear my Saviour calling
I can hear my Saviour calling take Thy cross and follow follow me
Where He leads me I will follow where He leads me I will follow
Where He leads me I will follow I'll go with Him with Him all the way
[ steel ]
I'll go with Him through the garden I'll go with Him through the garden
I'll go with Him through the garden I'll go with Him with Him all the way
Where He leads me...Ever since the day he took your love from me
I've always said the time would set me free
But it seems that I can find no peace of mind
And I find I'm crying almost all the time
Almost all the time I tell myself I must forget
Almost all the time and oh how I've tried but haven't yet
[ steel ]
I break down each time I see you on the street
Inside it hurts each time that you don't see
You don't miss me I don't ever cross your mind
But darling I miss you all the time
Almost all the time...Had 'em dressed in their Sunday best calling me dirty words
Had a few drive by shootin' me the bird
Night-stalking me, callin' my phone blowing up
Going all Carrie Underwood on my truck
They get crazy and mean
And everything in between
You can't blame no one else
When you brought it all on yourself
Don't tick her off, break her heart, tell her lies
Don't feed her any lipstick alibis
Ain't nothing she can't see through
No telling what she might do
Maybe get half-drunk, half-wild and wanna fight
Keep yelling at you, cussing at you all night
Hell-bent on tearing you something new
When she goes all country on you
I've had 'em burn my clothes in a barrel in the front yard
Revenging and binging up my credit cards
Post pictures of me naked with my ink showing through
In the places no one knew there were tattoos
Don't tick her off, break her heart, tell her lies
Don't feed her any lipstick alibis
Ain't nothing she can't see through
No telling what she might do
Maybe get half-drunk, half-wild and wanna fight
Keep yelling at you, cussing at you all night
Hell-bent on tearing you something new
When she goes all country on you
They go out of their heads
Hell, yeah, they get all red
But you can't blame no one else
When you brought it all on yourself
Don't tick her off, break her heart, tell her lies
Don't feed her any lipstick alibis
Ain't nothing she can't see through
No telling what she might do
Maybe get half-drunk, half-wild and wanna fight
Keep yelling at you, cussing at you all night
Hell-bent on tearing you something new
When she goes all country on you
Don't tick her off, break her heart, tell her lies
Don't feed her any lipstick alibis
Ain't nothing she can't see through
When she goes all country on you
Come onYeah you got every guy in here
Spinnin' around spillin' their beer.
I bet you came out to have a good time
So what you say you leave your friends with mine?
Ooh, ooh, they'll be alright, ooh, I just wanna see you shine.
Girl you're tearin' that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Woah, baby lets go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you park on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you girl.
Yeah, let me see you girl.
Whatcha think about takin' that chance.
Takin' that ride, takin' my hand.
Kickin' this crowd, ditchin' this club
This nights been waitin' on us.
Ooh, ooh, lets see your best moves, ooh, ooh
Yeah till I get us where we're gettin' to.
Girl you're tearin' that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Woah, baby lets go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you park on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you girl.
I can see you gettin' my tailgate rockin'
Moving your hips like wind moves cotton
You can get the whole wide country side hoppin'
Bring the beat back, oh come on with me girl
Girl you're tearin' that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Woah, baby lets go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you park on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you girl.
Yeah, let me see you girl.
Come on, come on, come on let me see you girl.There was light in the room
Then you left and it was through
Then the frost started in
My toes and fingertips
And it spread
And it spread into my heart
And it spread
And it spread into my heart
Then for I don't know how long
I settled in to doing wrong
And as the wind fills the sail
Came the thought to hurt my self
Come on,
And it spread
And it spread into my home
And it spread
And it spread into my soul
Well there are no lines
Separating the truth from the lie
Then you came back from space
With a brand new laugh and a different space
You took my hand and held it up
And shot my arm full of love
And it spread
And it spread into the world
And it spread, ooh
And it spread into the world
Well there are no lines
Separating the truth from the lieThere's no time to kill between the cradle and the grave
Father Time still takes a toll on every minute that you save
Legal tender's never gonna change the number on your days
The highest cost of livin's dyin', that's one everybody pays
So have it spent before you get the bill, there's no time to kill
If we'd known ten years ago today would be ten years from now
Would we spend tomorrow's yesterdays and make it last somehow
Or lead the cheers in someone else's game and never learn to play
And see the rules of thumb are all the same that measure every day
The grass is green on both sides of the hill, there's no time to kill
No time to kill, even I've said it, and probably always will
But I can look ahead and see that time ain't standin' still
No time to kill but time to change the kind of hurry I've been in
And quit this work and worry lookin' back at where I've been
If you don't look ahead nobody will, there's no time to kill
If we had an hour glass to watch each one go by
Or a bell to mark each one to pass, we'd see just how they fly
Would we escalate the value to be worth its weight in gold
Or would we never know the fortunes that we had 'til we grow old
And do we just keep killin' time until there's no time to kill
No time to kill, even I've said it and probably always will
But I can look ahead and see that time ain't standin' still
No time to kill but time to change the kind of hurry I've been in
And quit this work and worry lookin' back at where I've been
If you don't look ahead nobody will, there's no time to kill
No time to kill, even I've said it and probably always will
But I can look ahead and see that time ain't standin' still
No time to kill but time to change the kind of hurry I've been in
And quit this work and worry lookin' back at where I've been
If you don't look ahead nobody will, there's no time to kill
No time to kill
No time to kill
No time to killTo everything
Turn, turn, turn
There is a season
Turn, turn, turn
And a time to every purpose under Heaven
A time to be born, a time to die
A time to plant, a time to reap
A time to kill, a time to heal
A time to laugh, a time to weep
To everything
Turn, turn, turn
There is a season
Turn, turn, turn
And a time to every purpose under Heaven
A time to build up, a time to break down
A time to dance, a time to mourn
A time to cast away stones
A time to gather stones together
To everything
Turn, turn, turn
There is a season
Turn, turn, turn
And a time to every purpose under Heaven
A time of love, a time of hate
A time of war, a time of peace
A time you may embrace
A time to refrain from embracings
A time to gain, a time to lose
A time to rend, a time to sew
A time to love, a time to hate
A time of peace, I swear it's not too lateMaybe it's the movies, maybe it's the books
Maybe it's the government and all the other crooks
Maybe it's the drugs, maybe it's the parents
Maybe it's the gangs, or the colors that we're wearin'
Maybe it's the high schools, maybe it's the teachers
Tattoos, pipe bombs underneath the bleachers
Maybe it's the music, maybe it's the crack
Maybe it's the bible, or could it be the lack
Come on people, now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another, right now...right now
Okay, maybe it's the papers, maybe it's the family
Maybe it's the internet, radio, TV
Maybe it's the president, maybe it's the last one
Maybe it's the one before that (what he'd done)
Maybe it's the athletes, maybe it's the ads
Maybe it's the sports fans, agents, fads
Maybe it's the homeless, aliens, immigrants
Maybe it's life, don't tell me that it's imminent
Come on people, now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
Come on people, now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
You gotta love one another
Maybe it's the fallout, maybe it's the ozone
Maybe it's the chemicals, the radiation, cell phones
Maybe it's the magazines, maybe it the next page
Lotteries, fast food, bad news, road rage
Maybe it the unions, big business
Maybe it's the KKK and the skinheads
Maybe it's the daughters, maybe it's the sons
Maybe it's the brothers of the mothers or the guns

Come on people, now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
(You know, if we don't talk about it, it ain't gonna get better)
We gotta love one another
(Talk to me...so, what do ya say...let's talk)
Maybe it's the arts, maybe it's the sex
Maybe it's the talk shows, maybe it's a reflex
Maybe it's the taxes, maybe it's the system
Judges, lawyers, prisons
Maybe it's the Catholics, maybe it's the Protestants
Maybe it's the addicts and the hippies and the communists
Maybe it's a fashion, maybe it's a trend
Maybe it's the future...maybe it's the endCouldn't stand all the pain, you caused, love was gone
I know you didn't mean to hurt me, but you were cold ,
like a stone
I didn't wanna see, a day without you
Chorus: and I'll move on, I'll never see you again
I'll be strong, I'm gonna ride the wind
The rain is gone, andthe sun is my friend
and I'll remember you
Everyone kept telling me, to find another heart
Nobody knows, how long and how hard
I tried
and I believed in you
ChorusShe said, "California," as a tear fell down her cheek
"Small town Missouri just ain't the life for me."
Waved goodbye to mom and dad, and all her friends
In that '97 Mustang, that we both lost it in
I can't recall the day I'd finally had enough
Chasing my father's dream instead of growing up
I turned in that uniform before I ever played a game
With a junior college scholarship in a white trash town upstate
You never know which way the road is gonna go when it bends
And all I know is what I'd give today to feel that way again, yeah
I made the most of no degree here selling cars
On the Westside of St. Louis where most the rich folks are
From time to time I hear about some star you met
And just how close you've come but haven't made it yet
It gets me thinking 'bout the way it was and all we could've been
Wondering if you ever wish you could feel that way again, oh, and feel that way again
You never know which way the road is gonna go when it bends
And all I know is what I'd give today to feel that way again
I cannot lie sometimes when I come back to town
I head out to the river and I roll the windows down
Listen to that Mississippi running through the night
Let it wash away the years and bring you back here by my side
Let it wash away the years and bring you back here by my side
Again, feel that way againThis is the boy that live in a house that love built
These are the arms that held the charms of the sweetest girl in town
These are the hands that made the plans for a house that love built
And this is the heart that got broke when the house got tumblin' down
The roof was made of moonlight with kisses warm and sweet
And all the beams were made of dreams that I laid at your feet
So walls are made of sunshine the sunshine of your smile
And all the bliss of that first kiss was mine for just a while
[ steel ]
This is the boy who destroyed the house that love built
My empty arms have lost the charms of the sweetest girl in town
These are the hands that made the plans for a house that love built
And this is the heart that got broke when the house got tumblin' down
The roof was made of moonlight with kisses warm and sweet
And all the beams were made of dreams that I laid at your feet
If you'll start all over and say that you're still mine
I'll build from love that's strong enough to stand the test of timeMake mine night time honky tonk women and bright signs I gotta play
At the end of the day
Give me the lights of the city and the feel of a woman against me and I'm on my way
Places faces jokers they play like they're aces kings and queens in shadowy scenes
Where the wine and the love are flowin'
And the lady you meet let you know she's goin' your way
When the sun sinks low and the working people go home
And the night life part of the city starts to turn on yeah
Jukebox cowboys're playin' the blues goodtime ladies're makin' their moves
Counting the neon blow no one's alone
So make mine night time...
[ guitar ]
Make mine night time...
I say make mine night time...[ Bill ]
Tonight in the darkness I was awakened by a knock at the door
And you know at first I thought that it was still a dreem
But you're back and I still can't believe I'm seeing you once more
God it's been so lonely without you where you've been
[ Mary Lou ]
Darling I missed you so won't you come walk with me
There's some place we must go there's something you must see
[ Bill ]
You're forgiving me for hurting you why I can see it in your eyes
And as you take my hand we're walking just as we used to do
Where you're taking me won't it ever be surprise it doesn't matter
Just as long as I'll never again be without you
[ Mary Lou ]
Darling I missed you so...
[ Bill ]
Why you're leading me down those same green summer lanes
That we so often walked together
And I'm so happy it's all like a dream come true
There's that tree we used to sat under it all comes back to me now
There's the road that leads down to the river where they found youI hear they're hiring men in Oklahoma
And I've been blessed with two hard working hands
I'll take that job till the mill goes back to working
And we'll make it through the hard times again
Like the preacher said in church last Sunday morning
Oh the Lord does things we may not understand
We both know that he'll take care of his children
If we live every day the best we can
And these hard times will be the closest times we've known
Let's laugh and dream of better days to come
These will be the good old days a little later on
And these hard times will be the closest times we've known
You know that heaven smiles on us and gives us all we need
We've got so much we should be thankful for
Dry your eyes turn out the light let me hold you close
That makes these hard times the closest times we've known
And these hard times will be...
Yes these hard times will be the closest times we've knownThe New York City folks say I'm too country the Grinny Village hippies call me square
But at the Long Horn barroom down in Dallas Texas
They call me the Texas Troubadour there
My home state of Texas you've been good to me your wide open spaces treat me fair
The girls are so much prettier down in Texas
They don't breathe that New York City polluted air
[ steel ]
The New York City sidewalks filled with people too busy to say hello to you there
With hearts as cold as the concrete that they walk on
They sure could use some clean fresh Texas air
Now Texas folks don't judge you till they know you
And they don't judge you then by what you wear
And you can feel at home anyplace in Texas
If you don't own a thing or if you're a millionaire
Now my home state of Texas...(I do swear that I'll always be there
I'd give anything and everything and I will always care
Through weakness and strength
Happiness and sorrow
For better, for worse
I will love you with every beat of my heart)
From this moment life has begun
From this moment you are the one
Right beside you is where I belong
From this moment on
From this moment I have been blessed
I live only for your happiness
And for your love I'd give my last breath
From this moment on
I give my hand to you with all my heart
Can't wait to live my life with you, can't wait to start
You and I will never be apart
My dreams came true because of you
From this moment as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment on
You're the reason I believe in love
And you're the answer to my prayers from up above
All we need is just the two of us
My dreams came true because of you
From this moment as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment
I will love you as long as I live
From this moment onYou said let's go away
And leave our worries behind us
You took me from my sorrow
And you treat me with kindness
Because I wanna be the one
Always by your side
And I'll pray the truth won't stay
But I'm always reminded
'Cause darlin' just between you and me
There is the man who gave you that ring
Just between you and me
There's a house and a baby
And they need
The love you've been giving to me
Yes all that's just between you and me
Today we took a train
And left our worries behind us
We held each other close
And our true love sweet blindness
'Cause I wanna be the one
Always by your side
I pray that you stay away
But I know they're gonna find out
'Cause darlin' just between me and you
There's the woman you gave your ring to
Just between me and you
There's a baby so blue
And he needs
The love I've been giving to you
But all that's just between
Yes all that's just between me and youThe first strange town I was ever in the county was hanging a man
Nobody cared if he lived or died and I just didn't understand
So I washed my face in the morning dew bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew and kept on moving along
The second strange town that I was in they were laughin' at a poor crippled man
Begging for nickels and dimes on the street and I just didn't understand
So I washed my face in the morning dew...
[ ac.guitar ]
The third strange town that I was in was settled peaceful and nice
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer and to me it didn't seem right
So I washed my face in the morning dew...
Someday times are bound to change it can't be very far
And each injustice I have seen will come before the bar
Then I'll wash my face in the morning dew bathe my soul in the sun
Wash my face in the morning dew and my journey will be doneAll your life you've lived a sinner the bright way you've never trod
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
When you come to cross the river and you haven't met with God
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
On down the dark river I'm sorry to say
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
Don't wait too long to let Jesus hear you pray
You won't give up your earthly treasures to enter the promised land
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
You can hear Jesus callin' but you won't accept his hand
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
On down the dark river I'm sorry to say
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
Don't wait too long to let Jesus hear you pray
When you come to cross the river Jesus won't give the command
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
And that dark rollin' river takes you to the sinkin' sand
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
On down the dark river I'm sorry to say
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
Don't wait too long to let Jesus hear you prayDown to a dollar in a terrible fix, i was hopin my bookie would call
Coolin my heels at the motel six, waitin for the axe to fall
Phone rings, man, i'm white as a ghost
But it's my baby on the line from the jersey coast, she says
"C'mon home, honey," gonna make it after all, and it's
First stop, salt lake city
Big springs, laramie lookin mighty pretty
Ogallala, north platte, sun settin in it
Newton to chicago in a new york minute
Then it's hobart, elkhart, maumee, cuyanoga
Youngstown, hazletown, dover i'm a flyin over
Fairfax, bloomfield, bless a my soul:
Highway 80, she's a might good road
I saw me a yarn on the tv set about the surfers out in malibalou
So i bought me some baggies and i hopped me a jet just to see if them stories was true
Well the water was cold and the beer was hot
Called my baby from the parkin lot, i said
"Baby, do you miss me?" "honey, you know that i do"
And it's first stop, salt lake city...
Now if i was a actor or a high-rollin hippie i would head out for the califo-line
Cruise my caddie up and down the strip, hollywood and by-god vine
But i'm an oklahoma boy and i'm east coast bound
Got a redneck woman in a blueblood town
And i'm goin back to see my baby just one more time
And it's first stop, salt lake city...Joey lived a mile out a Southern Cross
Working on trucks for the local pit boss
Friday nights when he'd come to town
They'd all line up to see him lay some
Rubber down
Joey had a ute built in '74
With a 350 Chevy and 4 on the floor
Chrome wire wheels and customized back
He could run the main street Â¼ mile in under 10 flat
Cause he's the king of the road out here
He's won four big Ford's and an old John Deer
He won the summer nationals twice
He's the king of the road out here on Friday nights
Was a summer's night and I remember it well
A city boy thought he had a story to tell
He had a turbo charged flash in the pan
He walked up to Joey and said hey
I hear you're the man
The whole town was there it was quite a scene
It was the biggest race there ever had been
That little car looked pretty in red
Now Joey's gran is driving it instead
You might have Brocky in the city spotlight
But you ain't ever seen Joey on a Friday night
Folks come a running from miles around
Just to see our Joey laying rubber downTo be with you is what I want more than anything
But I must share my life with the one who wears my ring
And there are tiny places I look into each night
I love you but my hands are tied
I know how much they need you and dear I understand
I know you'll never leave them cause you're not that kind of man
But I can't control my feelings though heaven knows I tried
And I love you but my hands are tied
My hands are tied and I can't break the ties that bind
I love you more than life but you never will be mine
I know how much you want me I can see it in your eyes
And I love you but my hands are tied
[ steel ]
My hands are tied and I can't break the ties that bind...
Yes I love you but my hands are tiedI hear your love has gone away
Left you feeling blue
Don't you know that one fine day
Love will come to you
When the tears are over
All the stories have been told
Step into the sun
You might find the one
God loves a river
Even if that river never hits the sea
Fairy tales to rummage sales
We all love a dream
Life is so damn messy
Love is so unclean
You cannot hold a hand
That is a thousand miles away
Best to let it go
For reasons we may never know
God loves a river
Even if that river never
I say that God loves a river
Even if that river never hits the sea
God must love a river
Even if that river never
I say that God loves a river
Even if that river never hits the seaI never told her the what not to do's I'm just not tyin' down kind
I've thought I could hold her much closer to me by giving her freedom a mind
I figured someday that she would outgrow her flare for the flirtin' and flinging
I finally gave her enough rope to hang her and she's still out there swinging
I never tried into the where's and the why's no matter what time she came in
While I thought she was out playin' bridge with the girls
She was out playin' games with the men
Too late I discovered she had too much slack like a fool to a dream I'm still clinging
I finally gave her enough rope to hang her and she's still out there swinging
[ guitar ]
Now here I sit with the why do I do's while she's running round wild and free
I tried to give her a mind of her own but she couldn't keep it on me
Now just like a fool I still sit here at home and wait by a phone that's my bringing
I finally gave her enough rope to hang her and she's still out there swinging
I finally gave her enough rope to hang her and she's still out there swingingI stepped out of the rain into a downtown city cafe
And I saw him at the counter looking lonesome at the rain
I sat down beside him and I ordered us some coffee
He smiled and said
Hello city country is my name and I'm here to play your city game
I saw there in his eyes such a pure and simple beauty
That could not have been bred upon these dark and dingy streets
I liked the look he gave me and I asked him if he'd stay
And he said
Maybe for a while till I get back on my feet and I sure could use a place to sleep
Lay lay country lay on my mind home is where the lovin' heart is beating free
Lay lay country lay on my mind
For deep inside these city lies a whole lot of country in me
A whole lot of country in me
The days we spent laughin' and just walkin' in the park
And the nights we spent in each other's arms
But time brought a change that brought him tossed and tumbled sleep
And I heard him mumble somethin' about a baby and a farm
I've gotta go make sure they're safe and warm
I woke up this morning and I opened up my eyes
Just in time to see him walkin' out the door
But I had dreams and feelings that would always keep me happy
Even though I knew I wouldn't see him anymore so I just let him close the door
Lay lay country lay on my mind...
Lay lay country lay on my mind...I supposed I ought to say congratulations for you've won the only girl I ever loved
But I've hurt too much to face the situation
Just take good care of her take good care of her
Just to be around her was my greatest pleasure
She was everything my future held in store
So remember when you take my only treasure
Please take good care of her take good care of her
I must accepted she loves you more than me
So with my broken heart I'll bow out gracefuly
Please don't send me any wedding invitations
For I couldn't dare to see her there with you
If she's happy that will be my consolation
So take good care of her take good care of herI believe my steps are growing wearier each day
Still I've got a journey on my mind
Lures of this old world have ceased to make me want to stay
And my one regret is leaving you behind
If it proves to be his will that I am first to go
And somehow I have a feeling it will be
When it comes your times to travel likewise don't feel lost
For I will be the first one that you'll see
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be waiting, drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming, I will rise up with the shout
And come running through the shallow waters, reaching for your hand
Through this life we've labored hard to earn our meager fare
It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes
I'll just rest here on the shore and turn my eyes away
Until you come, then we'll see paradise
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be waiting, drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming, I will rise up with the shout
And come running through the shallow waters, reaching for your hand
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be waiting, drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming, I will rise up with the shout
And come running through the shallow waters, reaching for your handNo day passes by no night without cry my whole world is hurt from now on
Each minute reveals heartbreak so real my whole world is hurt from now on
And if I try to forget a just plain misery
I'm more confused and emptiness right here inside of me
And no future's bright out go those lights
My whole world is hurt from now on
And if I try to forget a just plain miseryDon't tell me that you love me when you know I know you don't
Don't let your passion disillusion you
Don't tell me you'll be true because you know I know you won't
Just one love is not enough for you
I'd be a fool to think that I could trust you all the time
But still I'm fool enough to love you and your wanderin' mind
When you're with me makes me believe that your love for me is true
And when I'm not around do what you're big enough to do
Don't tell me that you love me
Don't tell me that you love me
Just one love is not enough for you just one love is not enough for youThey call you the Killer, say your like a disease
You got the world in your pocket but you ain't foolin me
You want something different, mama I understand
I'm just a mess in a rock 'n roll band
I'm just a mess in a rock 'n roll band
You call it trouble
You call it trouble
You call it trouble, I call it love
Now don't keep me guessing, more than tonight is at stake
You got a hold of my heart and it's all I can take
You want something different, mama I understand
I'm just a mess in a rock 'n roll band
I'm just a mess in a rock 'n roll band
You call it trouble
You call it trouble
You call it trouble, I call it love(Dolly Parton)
Stand back, and give me room
And listen to that beat
I got the music in my soul
And the rhythm in my feet
When I hear the music
You won't catch me standing still
And I won't miss a beat
I never have and I never will
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
I can dance to anything
That any band can play
I've got old-fashioned values
But I'm pretty up to date
And I know all the latest hits
On the radio
You don't have to join me
Stand back and watch my show
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
Thought I couldn't dance
Hey, watch me prance
Let's make romance
Thought I couldn't dance
You gotta take a chance
If you're gonna learn to dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
There's a lot of closet dancers
Just dyin' to come out
They dance alone inside their rooms
With the music way up loud
And I know you thought I couldn't dance
But I guess I sure fooled you
It just goes to show you never know
Who's wearing dancin' shoes
And you thought I couldn't dance
I'm full of surprises
And you thought I couldn't dance
It's too late now
I can't slow down...can't slow down
Oh, feel the heat
From these dancin' feet... can't slow down
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
Repeat...You say that you will
When I know that you won't
You say that you do
Baby when I know you don't
Really love me
You never loved me at all
Honey you never tried
If you did you would have had to crawl
You say that I did
Baby when you know I don't
You said that I will
When you knew that I won't
Ever love you
No I would not even try
Look if you say it again
I'll swear that's just one big lie
Oh you say that you do
But we both know you don't
You still say that you will
When it's so for sure you won't
Ever love me
No you never even try
From the first day we met
And you said it, that was a lieSomewhere along the way we tough to keep it all together,
We mask the pain we feel inside, to make everyone else feel better,
You wrap your arms around yourself and bury all your sorrow,
You can't hide from your emotions baby, they'll still be here tomorrow,
If your heart won't let it flow,
I want you to know,
[Chorus]
It's OK to cry (Everybody's gotta hurt sometime)
Let those tear drops fly (Don't even try to dry your eye)
Don't keep it all inside (In the mornin' it'll be alright)
It's OK to cry
First you gotta fall apart to pick up all the pieces,
If you don't learn to let it go,
The pain inside increases,
It takes more strength to hold it in then to give in and surrender,
Why's the first thing that we learn,
The last thing we remember?
Baby, tears don't make you weak, If I could only make you see,
[Chorus]
It ain't nothing at all
Sometimes you gotta break down and let 'em fall,
Baby that's true
[Chorus]
It's OK to cryYup, yup, wooo

Never been to Chattahoochee
She may look like New York, Miami, L.A.
But when it comes to lovin' me, she ain't that way
She got a little country, got a little country
Got a little country in her
Ah yeah
Friday, soho
That's where all the cool, cool people go
Shake your pelvis
That's how you get behind the velvet
Disco at the air bar
But what I really miss is a guitar
With a whammy bar
Going wah, wah, wah, wah
She may look like New York, Miami, L.A.
But when it comes to lovin' me, she ain't that way
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
Got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country in her
Ah, hang on!
She's got a little country, got a little country
I said, she's got a little country, got a little country in her
Got a little country, got a little country
Got a little country, got a little country
Giddy up!
She's runnin' with the big dogs, she's livin' on the high hog
We're rolling in the hay every night
She's even saying yeehaw ridin' that hillbilly seesaw
We're having us a ball and holding on tight
She may look like New York, Miami, L.A.
But when it comes to lovin' me, she ain't that way
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
Got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country in her
Yup, yup
Hang on!
That's country right there
Yeehaw!
Wooo!(Dolly Parton)
Spent all my money on everyone else
Why I just kept handing it out right and left
They didn't appreciate none of my help
I have found
Had me a man
I was so much in love
But he just walked off after using me up
I cried like a baby
It hurt me so much and I'm down
Yeah, I'm sure down
I know that I'm down but I'm gonna get up
I just need some time
Just need a little streak of good luck
And you know that it's rough when your bitting the dust like I am
You try to do right but tell me where does that get you
People just use you and then they forget you
Well it wont take me long
To get my feet back on solid ground
But now I'm down
When I get my life back in order again
Well I'll still be willing to help out my friends
And if you need some body or wished it had been, look around
I'll be spending my money on everyone else
Well I'll just be handing it out right and left
I'll find a new love i wont live by myself
I'm just down, now, yeah I'm down
I know that I'm down but I'm gonna get up
I just need some time
Just need a little streak of good luck
And you know that it's rough when your bitting the dust like I am
You try to do right but tell me where does that get you
People just use you and then they forget you
Well it wont take me long
To get my feet back on solid ground
But now I'm down
I know that I'm down
But I'm bound to get upHer memory was a mountain
As tall as it was wide
It cast a cold dark shadow
Across this heart of mine
I tried to rise above it
Might have rolled a stone or two
The mountain moved
And I could see
A vision of forever standing right in front of me
The earth stood still
And the light broke through
Some miracles only love can do
The mountain moved
I say you smiling at me
I heard you speak my name
You reached out to hold me
And I let go of yesterday
It's still there in the distance
But it's fading from my view
'Cause last night for the first time
The mountain moved
And I could see
A vision of forever standing right in front of me
The earth stood still
And the light broke through
Some miracles only love can do
The mountain movedI'm a hard hard worker everyday
I'm a hard hard worker and I'm workin' everyday
I'm a hard hard worker and I'm savin' all my pay
If I ever get some money for the wait
I'm going to take it all out and celebrate
I'm a hard hard worker everyday
Well I woke up early this morn
And I woke up early this morn, morn, morn
Yeah I woke up early this morn
And I got up early to sing
And I got up early to sing
I got up early to sing
I'm a hard hard worker I'm workin' everyday
I'm a hard hard worker and I'm savin' all my pay
If I ever get some money for the wait
I'm going to take it all out and celebrate
I'm a hard hard worker everyday
Well I give my thanks to the Lord
And I give my thanks to the Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, please give me some more
And I got way down on my knees
Sayin' Lord can't you help me if you please, please, please
Can you save me from this workin' man's disease
Load in
Load out
Get down
Get out
Drive home
Too late
My mind stays crooked
And my back stays straight
I'm a hard hard worker everyday
I'm a hard hard worker and I'm savin' all my pay
If I ever get some money for the wait
I'm going to take it all out and celebrate
I'm a hard hard worker everyday
I'm a hard hard worker everyday
I'm a hard hard worker everydayOur bodies lay here side by side
But our thoughts have turned the other way
We make the conversation of two people
Who have nothing left to say
We're so accustomed to each other
We no longer care or bother
And there lies the danger
You know the size of clothes I wear
You know how I comb my hair
But you could know as much about a stranger
I can't remember the last time
That I really wanted you
And we both say nothings wrong
But it's here in everything we do
So we get up from our beds
Leaving many thing unsaid
And there lies the danger
Many of my words you don't hear
You seldom notice if I'm near
You could know as much about a stranger
What went wrong, I can't name it
Find the fault, I can't blame it
On any one thing
We're so used to things this way
Tomorrow's just like yesterday
And there lies the danger
You know the colour of my eyes
You know the things I despise
But you could know as much about a stranger
Yes, you could know as much about a strangerSometimes I hear a woman cryin
And a man sayin nothin at all
Often I hear children laughin
And footsteps walkin down the hall
There's a ghost for every memory
Always remindin me that I was wrong
And since her leavin
I've been sleepin
Leavin all of the lights on
(Chorus)
What was once a happy home
Feels more like a haunted house
Haunted by the sounds of broken hearts
Rattlin off the chain of broken vows
It sends a chill through my bones
It's got me scared as a mouse
Now empty and alone
What was once a happy home
Feels more like a haunted house
There's no place to run and hide
I swear she's everywhere I go
In every room I, smell her perfume,
I know she's not here
But I'm not alone
(Chorus)
It sends a chill through my bones
It's got me scared as a mouse
Now empty and alone
What was once a happy home
Feels more like a haunted houseEvery morning I watch you
Walk into the office, in you business suit
And matching shoes
With your hair pulled back neatly
You tug at your glasses
And you sit down just 3 desks down
And I watch you in the fluorescent glare,
And my mind drifts away somewhere
And I see you... In a different light
Your hair falling down
With love in your eyes
In my mind.... you're a beautiful sight
I see you in a different light
Just the way I saw you, last night
There's girls at the office
The guys always notice, when they walk by
But, you're not the type
They don't know what I know
How somethings just don't show
In tailored tweets, that's fine with me
Let them all think what they want to
As for me when I look at you
I see you... In a different light
Your hair falling down
With love in your eyes
In my mind... You're a beautiful sight
I see you in a different light
Just the way I saw you, last night
Baby it's you... In a different light
Your hair falling down
With love in your eyes
In my mind... You're a beautiful sight
I see you in a different light
Just the way I saw you, last night
"It's You"
In a different light
Your hair falling down
With love in your eyes
In my mind you're a beautiful sight
I see you in a different light
Just the way I saw you, last nightI like holding you and I like squeezing you
I like having you around and I like teasing you
I like kissing you and I like hugging you
But most of all I think I'm a gonna like loving you
Each morning when the sun peeps through my window
The thought of you makes getting up a breeze
Knowing you has given me another life to live
And all my me's have been replaced by we
And I like holding you...
[ ac.guitar ]
(Since the day we met we been so happy walking hand in hand beneath the sun
Now I found the brand new feeling going deep inside
And it's plain to see the best is yet to come)
And I like holding you...
But most of all I think I'm a gonna like loving youIn a barroom in Chicago somewhere after midnight
I'm sitting on a barstool drinking like a fish
And although I just met you I can tell by looking
You're wondering what my problem really is
Next time you're in Tulsa go see Mrs Johnson
And you'll be looking my problem right between the eyes
Next time you're in Tulsa tell her her ex-husband
Loves her still and will until he dies
[ steel ]
Walk up to her front door ask to see the children
Take them all some candy and a big kiss from their dad
Tell them how I miss them and I'll be down next winter
But not till then cause now I hurt too bad
Next time you're in Tulsa...I've lived enough to know that love's not everything you need
God knows I know, there are still so many things you wanna be
I've seen enough to understand the pain your going though
It's just a shame to know,
I'm not enough for you
It hurts to see the hurt the need,
Your laughter and your light
And try in vain to free the painful secret locked behind your eyes
And I can't even blame for the things, your turning to
It's just a shame to know,
I'm not enough for you
I've given you the best of everything I had to give
And now there's nothing left for me to leave you,
But my will to live
I hope someday, somebody, somewhere will love you like I do
It's just a shame to know,
I'm not enough for you
Oh, It's just a shame to know
I'm not enough for youEverything I touch turns to ashes
So I wouldn't dare lay a hand on you
I've never had much luck with passion
But I can tell you're wantin' me too
Every time you look my way I shiver
I'm havin' a hard time keepin' my cool
I see the message your eyes deliver
Or is it just the smoke in the room
I feel the heat
It's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
I feel the sweat
Rollin' down the nape of my neck
You're burnin' me up
Just look at this ragin' fire you started
Don't stop now
Baby you're cold hearted
Well I've always been a little bit reckless
Oh and now here I am playin' with fire
With every sweet kiss from your red lips
You make my temperature rise
I feel the heat
It's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
I feel the sweat
Rollin' down the nape of my neck
You're burnin' me up
Just look at this ragin' fire you started
Don't stop now
Baby that's cold hearted
I feel the heat
It's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
I feel the sweat
Rollin' down the nape of my neck
Oh you're burnin' me up
Oh look at this ragin' fire you started
Don't stop now
Baby that's cold heartedHave our hearts ache with grieve as we say goodbye we shall meet someday
Where no sorrow or tears ever dim the eyes we shall meet someday
We shall meet where no storm clouds gather we shall meet someday
By the river of life sparkling cool and clear we shall meet someday
[ guitar ]
When we all cross the stream with its rolling tide we shall meet someday
In this city of rest on the other side we shall meet someday
We shall meet...Written by billy burnette.
Oh go now and tell the world about it
Stop this show now
There's too few here to die
We don't want war now
Just go on out and shout it
We've tried so many times to change directions
We've even tried some peaceful demonstrations
I wish this could be
Oh, I wish this could be the last war song
Well I just don't know
Leaders never listen
To anyone you know
They have so many reasons
Telling you the score
And make it sound confusingUsually take one last pass through town
Stop the car and touch the ground
Watch those streetlights swayin' in the breeze
Decorated store fronts
Rusty old gas pumps
Try to fill my mind up
With somethin' before I go
Picture postcard memories
You know they always make for good company
I don't know no town
Like the old town
Even when the miles are many
I feel like I'm still around
Deep inside me
Like rings through an oak tree
Yeah, there something 'bout a Sunday when I'm gone
That keeps me turning home
I'm standin' here beneath these billboard lights
Takes me back to those autumn nights
Hometown bleachers packed real tight
As we marched down the field
My feet would swing from a dropped tailgate
Out on Airport Road real late
No one could walk a line too straight
We usually made it home alright
And glory days I cant re-live
Stories I'll never forget
And I don't know no friends
Like the old friends
I never seem to laugh now
Like I did with them
But deep inside me
A piece of my history
Yeah, I hear their voices even though they're gone
Yeah it keeps me turning home
Never twice the same way does it start
And sure enough she stole my heart
On the old gym floor, spinnin' round and round one night
And though we both tried hard to wait
We sure did love the taste
Of the sweet love being made and prayin' I got it right
Graduation came and went
Along with all the time we spent
And I don't know no love
Like the first love
When I think about the best times
She's the one I think of
Deep inside me
All though the taste is bittersweet
I see her smilin' even though she's gone
And it keeps me turning home, yeah
It keeps me turning homeLately nothing I do ever seems to please you
And maybe turning my back would be that much easier
'Cause hurtful words are all that we exchange
But I can't watch you walk away
Can I forget about the way it feels to touch you
And all about the good times that we've been through?
Could I wake up without you every day
And would I let you walk away?
No, I can't learn to live without
And I can't give up on us now
Oh, I know I could say we're through
And tell myself I'm over you
But even if I made a vow
I promise not to miss you now
And try to hide the truth inside
I fell 'cause I, I just can't live a lie
Could I forget the look that tells me that you want me
And all the reasons that make loving you so easy
The kiss that always makes it hard to breathe
The way you know just what I mean?
No, I can't learn to live without
Oh, so don't you give up on us now
Oh, I know I could say we're through
And tell myself I'm over you
But even if I made a vow
I promise not to miss you now
And try to hide the truth inside
I fell 'cause I, I just can't live a lie
Oh, and I don't wanna try
Oh, I know I could say we're through
And tell myself I'm over you
But even if I made a vow
I promise not to miss you now
And try to hide the truth inside
I fell 'cause I, I just can't live a lie
(I just can't live a lie)
But even if I made a vow
I promise not to miss you now
And try to hide the truth inside
I fell 'cause I, I just can't live a lie
Oh, I can't live a lie
Oh, I can't live a lieI grew up in the scantling yards of Wheeling, West Virginia
A wheelhouse cub looking for an open door
In the packet ways a Sweeney wed the keel of my Bonita
Just two months from her timbers 'til she moored
I paid the fare in billet on her maiden voyage to Vicksburg
And talked my way to hand the tiller on the course
In her planks I carved a notch and sealed the vow 'Be my Bonita'
And her dowry was my life between the shores
I was born with rouging ways, and she steered me like a woman
From the port calls and the bawds that lead me stray
The calliope serenades, made the old towns come running
And the boys would gamble shards to pull her chains
The striker's boast would fain me loss, about the wrecks the shoals were keeping
And how the old girl's got poor Billy's ransom saved
On the lake at Bistineau, she set the wharf at Dixie
With a thousand bales of cotton on her main
As the great raft disappeared, the watermark went sinking
And she was stuck right hard, a listing on the bank
With the furnace still a blaze, I stood my last upon her
Then climbed the prow and took a landsman's trade
'A derelict now Milady' said the watch log I've concorded
'Have the bosun sound us eight bells for the change'
Cause I was born with rouging ways, and she steered me like a woman
From the port calls and the bawds that lead me stray
The calliope serenades, made the old towns come running
And the boys would gamble shards to pull her chains
And I would take to wider walks, so the gin I stopped a drinking
At three scores aloft this crooked frame
The striker's boast would fain me loss, about the wrecks the shoals were keeping
And how the old girl's got poor Billy's ransom savedThousand miles
Of lonesome highway
Drinking gallons of coffee in a little cafe
Brought me here, and it's so good to find there's someone who's got
The same story as mine
Just look at us, we're a couple hard cases
So how'd we end up where we are?
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart
I feel somethin hittin me awful hard
I don't know where it's callin me
Well I just know it starts
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart
(Alison)
Been so long
I can't believe I'd get somethin so sweet
Where an ache used to be, don't fall
If love anymore but I'd never met anyone like you before
Stay here with me for a couple more weeks
I think there's somethin goin' on
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart
I feel somethin hittin me awful hard
Don't know where it's callin me
I just know it starts
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart
(Shenandoah)
Well it sure took a while to find it
It's been waiting there all this time
(Both)
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart
I feel somethin hittin me awful hard
(Alison)
Don't know where it's callin me
(Shenandoah)
Well I just know it starts
(Both)
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heartHey girl, what's your name girl?
Ive been lookin' at you
And every guy here's doin' the same girl
It'd be a shame girl
If I let you just walk on by
'Cause I'm all caught up in your sweet smile
A girl like you comes around once in a while
So hot, gotta give it a shot
Gotta get, get a little bit of what you got
[Chorus]
I know you don't know me, but I can't leave here lonely
Knowin' I didn't even try to make you mine and
You might think I'm crazy
Girl, but who could blame me
You're lookin' so fine, got me all tongue tied
And the only line I can think to say is
Hey girl, whatcha think girl
You look a little thirsty, lemme go getcha something to drink girl
Before you blink girl
I'll be right back by your side
And if you want we can roll out
I know my way 'round this town
I got a shotgun seat for you
You can tell me where it is you wanna take off to
[Chorus]
I know you don't know me, but I can't leave here lonely
Knowin' I didn't even try to make you mine and
You might think I'm crazy
Girl, but who could blame me
You're lookin' so fine, got me all tongue tied
And the only line I can think to say is
Hey girl
Ohh, baby youre still standin' here
I guess you must like what you hear
Hey girl, whatcha say girl
'Bout you and me gettin' away girl
[Chorus]
I know you don't know me, but I can't leave here lonely
Knowin' I didn't even try to make you mine and
You might think I'm crazy
Girl, but who could blame me
You're lookin' so fine, got me all tongue tied
And the only line I can think to say is
Hey girl
Oh, yeah
Whoa, hey girl
You're lookin' so fine, got me all tongue tied
And the only line I can think to say is
Hey girl
Oh, yeahSeven years old, everything was right
A table for four on a Friday night
Didn't see any signs of a dead end road
By the time I was ten everything was changing
Fell asleep every night praying
Didn't know which way to go
Momma did her best to hide her anger
And I did my best to try and save her
I was a little too young and a little too dumb to ever think the day would come
When dad would drive away and take his love with him
So I grew up fast in a whole new world
Waved goodbye to that little girl
I can see her now, innocent and seven
I wish I had never turned eleven
We moved into a smaller house
How mama did it, oh I don't know how
Never went to bed without eating
At thirteen I finally realized what it means to get on with your life
Well daddy sure did and he made it look easy
Mama did her best to hide the struggle
And I did my best to stay out of trouble
I was a little too young and a little too dumb to ever think the day would come
When dad would drive away and take his love with him
So I grew up fast in a whole new world
Waved goodbye to that little girl
I can see her now, innocent and seven
I wish I had never turned eleven
I wish that I could turn back time and tell myself it'll be alright, you're never gonna lose the light in your eyes.
I was a little too young and a little too dumb to ever think the day would come
So I grew up fast in a whole new world
Waved goodbye to that little girl
I can see her now, innocent and seven
I wish I had never turned eleven
I wish I had never turned eleven.Some day I'm gonna drive me a faster car
Park in front of a house with a bigger yard
I'm gonna break my back
I'm gonna bust my tail
Taking everything up another notch
I'm scared
I won't fake
[Chorus]
But I'll never ever do better than you
When it comes to your love baby
I've already done the best I can do
It's so true
I'll never ever do better than you
One day I'm gonna hit a little bigger lake
I'll bring you home an even bigger chair
One more and margins going to smile on me
I'm going to go higher than I've aimed to be
Wait and see
[Chorus]
Though I'll never ever do better than you
When it comes to your love baby
I've already done the best I can do
It's so true
I'll never ever do better than you
Oh there's nothing better than you
Never do better than youOnce was a woman and once was a man
Who'd never been lovers, just good friends
Both of them happy with rings on their hands
But they'd dreamed of each other, romance
So picture two people alone in a room
Together for the very first time
Candles are burning, holding each other
And picture two people whose dreams have come true
They must be goin' out of their minds
If for only a moment seems like forever
Finishing touches
The canvas set to dry
Each color tells its story
Of where and when and why
Finishing touches
Now no one can know what a love is to life
Till they have to choose one, lose one
And no one can know what a heartache is like
Till they have to break one, take one
Finishing touches
The canvas set to dry
Each color tells its story
Of where and when and why
Finishing touches
Now, there is a woman and there is a man
Who used to be good friends, now they're just lovers
Their dreams of forever must come to an end
And stop all this madness, somehow recover
So picture two people alone in a room
Who finally have made up their minds
Oh, how the tears flow, both know
And picture them holdin' each other real tight
Knowing it's the very last time
They gotta let go, let go
Finishing touches
The canvas set to dry
Each color tells its story
Of where and when and why
Finishing touches
The canvas set to dry
Each color tells its story
Of where and when and why
Finishing touchesHeartache Number One was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
Heartache Number Two was when you came back again
You came back and never meant to stay
[Chorus]
Now I've got heartaches by the number
Troubles by the score
Everyday you love me less
Each day I love you more
Now I've got heartaches by the number
A love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting
That's the day my world will end
Heartache Number Three was when you called me
And told me you was coming to stay
With hoping heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited but you must have lost your way
[Chorus]
Now I've got heartaches by the number
A love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting
That's the day my world will end
Ah the day that I stop counting
That's the day my world will endHad to steal, daddy's car, park it far from her house
And throwing rocks at her window til she's sneaking out
How to get a college kid to get you good stuff
Mix a perfect drink in a Sonic cup
How to lean back, fake a yawn
Stretch your arm round her shoulder
Pull her closer til she let you lean in for a kiss
How to turn a twenty into Saturday night
How to make her momma let you have her til midnight
How not to let her know she's got you caught
These are the things that you learn
When your heart just wants to burn, burn
These are the steps that you take
When you're only thinking one thing
And you don't know nothing bout a promise and forever
All you know is nothing's better than being together
And the only thing you want in the world, is a girl
How to act like you're listening to her about her day
When she's talking and she's blocking the game
How to shut your mouth when it's that time of the month
Knowing when she's mad and when she's really just drunk
And you swear that you'll change all our ways
Just to get her to believe you and move into your man cave
How to hide a ring in your pocket for weeks
How to say them four words and make 'em sound so sweet
That she'd never ever say no, no no no
These are the things that you learn
When your heart just wants to burn, burn
These are the steps that you take
When you're only thinking one thing
And you don't know nothing bout living ever after
But you know you're nothing unless you get to have her
And the only thing you want in the world, is a girlI DREAMED OF AN OLD LOVE AFFAIR
(Jimmie Davis - Bonnie Dodd - Charles Mitchell)
'56 Peer International, BMI
Just like old times you were here last night
And gone was my worry and care
When I awoke I knew then that I
had dreamed of an old love affair
I was alone in the darkness my dear
Many dreams ago you left me there
Sunlight told me you were gone and that I
Had dreamed of an old love affair
I've been so lonely since you have gone
I loved you with all of my heart
Heaven was mine when you smiled last night
And said that we'd make a new start
Life seems so empty without you my dear
If it's sun or rain I just don't care
Sunlight told me you were gone and that I
Had dreamed of an old love affairOld ticket stubs, gum wrappers etched
In ways to write your name
Love letter scraps no strings attached
Just odds and ends and things
Wind blows through these photographs
Our innocence, the aftermath
Thanks to spring I changed my purse
Came upon this ancient curse
The ache and thirst to feel your touch
I wonder if I'll love that much again
Life's windows change, new faces flash
Like cars these days go by
Such little things unlease the past
Like feelings locked inside
Broken plastic dimestore ring
Holds al the tears my heart contains
Thanks to spring I clean these drawers
Dump this stuff out on the floor
I taste these tears, I breathe this dust
I wonder if I'll ever love that much again
Thanks to spring I wind these clocks
Empty out these cardboard boxes
Sweep across these closet shelves
The memories replay themselves
I open up my window wide
And smell the sweet new grass outside
Amazing grace, the seeds of trust
I wonder if I'll ever love that much again
Old ticket stubs, gum wrappers etched
In ways to write your nameFair weather friends, fair weather sailors,
Will leave you stranded on life's shore.
One good friend who truly loves you
Is worth the pain your heart endures.
We never know which way the wind will blow,
Nor when or where the next turmoil will be.
But He's a solid rock when troubles grow,
And He's holding out a saving hand for me.
He'll be a refuge in the storm;
He'll be a beacon in the night;
In the chilly winds of doubt He'll keep you warm;
When you can't find your way He'll be your lightOn and on she'll walk this earth
Her face like a beautiful flower
But all alone is a marble stone
You'll find her name written there
Her new voice rings where the angels sing
Her voice so pure and so fair
And if you'll look in the Heavenly book
You'll find her name written there
I'm all alone since the call of fate
Left me in deepest despair
And if you'll wait at the pearly gate
You'll find her name written there
I'll breathe her name into the air
It goes and I know not where
But if you look in the heart of a friend
You'll find her name written thereWhen I was a little boy
Daddy used to say to me
"Son, we got a lot of land
We got a lot of work to be done
Go get your marbles put 'em in the house
Tear down your castles in the sand
Come with your poppy to the cotton patch
Get a little dirt on your hands, get a little dirt on your hands
Get a little dirt on your hands, son
Get a little dirt on your hands
If you're gonna grow up to be a big, big man
Get a little dirt on your hands
Get a little dirt on your hands"
Well, I reached twenty-one
And I thought I was a pretty big wheel
I left the country for the city
Met a slicker with a shady deal
He said, "Hold up the bank, boy and take all the money
And run as fast as you can
The only way you'll ever get along in this world
Is to get a little dirt on your hands, get a little dirt on your hands
Get a little dirt on your hands, son
Get a little dirt on your hands
If you want to grow up to be a big, big man
Get a little dirt on your hands
Get a little dirt on your hands"
Well, it's four in the morning
And the warden is calling' my name
He said he's teaching' me a lesson
Now he's making' me go work in the rain
Dig that ditch, boy, fill it up
I'm wanting you to understand
The only way to straighten out a guy like you
Is to get a little dirt on his hands, get a little dirt on his hands
Hey, David got to get a little dirt on those hands boy
Yeah, if you want to grow up to be a big, big man
You better remember what old Whispering Bill
Told you in this song, get a little dirt on those hands
Get a little dirt on your hands, son
Get a little dirt on your hands
If you want to grow up to be a big, big man
Get a little dirt on your hands
Get a little dirt on your hands
Get a little dirt on your hands, son
I got a little dirt on my hands
Get a little dirt on your hands(Dolly Parton)
A dirt dobber built its nest
On my only Sunday dress
And the roof leaked in my shoes
And when they dried they were too small
And the rats chewed a great big hole
In my only winter coat
And at night I'd hear them gnaw
The paper on my bedroom wall
But I still say
Those were the greatest days of all
Some happy and some sad
Some good and some bad
But I still say
Those were the greatest days of all
I used to wait by the garden gate
Where the hummingbirds came ev'ry day
To kiss the yellow roses
Growing up the garden wall
And in the tall grass I would lie
'Til ev'ning shadows brought the night
Thru the window of my room
I'd hear the whippoorwill's sad call
And I still say
Those were the greatest days of all
Some happy and some sad
Some good and some bad
But I still say
Those were the greatest days of all
Now as I make my way
Along the busy city sidewalks
My head arouring from the deafening city sound
You can't hear a whipporwill in this noisy city
And tall green grass don't grow
Along the sidewalks of this town
And hummingbirds don't fly around
These artificial roses
Like they did around the garden wall
And, oh, so often in my mind
I'll go back to another time
And I still say
Those were the greatest days of all
I still say
Those were the greatest days of allThere's just a hint of indifference
In her lack of conversation when we talk.
And the subject matters change,
There's no mention of our future now at all.
She still kisses me each morning,
But it seems more like a habit than before.
I know she still loves me,
But I don't think she likes me anymore.
She used to laugh at all my jokes,
But lately I can't seem to make her smile.
And the last time we made love it was good,
But God it's been a while.
She's always there when I get home,
But she's no longer waiting at the door.
I know she still loves me,
But I don't think she likes me anymore.
'Cause it's just a little colder every time I hold her.
She's just going through the motions
From what's left of her devotion;
And it scares me half to death
Wonderin' what tomorrow holds in store.
I know she still loves me,
But I don't think she likes me anymore.
Right now I know she loves me,
But I don't think she likes me anymore.Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life a new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
You don't love me, it's plain
I should know you'll never wear your ring
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life a new
Instead of having sweet dreams about youOh oh oh love me like that love me like that
And darling love me forever
Old man and woman a beautiful sight
Still so in love makes the whole world seem bright
Their age is a symbol of a wonderful thing
The happiness true love can bring
Oh oh oh love me like that
Be mine forever I want nothing more
I'll leave you never my heart's very sure
All that I ask is forever be true love me as I love youI can see the dark clouds over head now I see raindrops falling from the sky
Seems every living thing is dead now ever since the day you said goodbye
I can hear the winter winds a blowing they chill my body to the bone
I can feel my life's slowly going livin' in a cold world all alone
But baby you can change my world by changing your mind
Drive away the clouds so the sun can shine
You can change it all by saying you're coming back and staying
You can change my world by changing your mind
[ guitar - steel ]
Mine is a world of desolation everything I cared about is gone
Only you can change the situation and all you got to do is come back home
Oh baby you can change my world...
Oh baby you can change it all by saying...don't ride your bike off a ramp that's more than three bricks high, don't take that candy from the store if you ain't got the dime, don't pick a fight with the little guy that doesn't talk that much, don't pick up a cherry bomb thinkin its a dud,and don't sneek out of a two story house using bed sheets for a rope. don't ask me how I know.
CHORSE
Sell your truck while its still runnin, save the jesus off the dash, say a prayer when you feel like cussin, save your money pay with cash, forget your pride buy the roses if your sorry tell her so, don't drink the water in mexico. don't ask me how I know.
don't quit your high school football team halfway through the season, don't bust your buddy in the nose when you know he didn't mean it, don't loose the girl you love at home for a night in panama city, don't rush off the phone when your momma calls you ain't that busy, you otta' make that drive to say good bye to your grandpa 'fore he goes. don't ask me how I know.
CHORSEThat ol' sun comes up every mornin'
And goes back down at the end of every day
It's just that way
Stars show up every evenin'
Man in the moon comes out to play
It's just that way
And girl, lovin' you
Is something I was born to do
It's just that way
The ocean wet the desert dry
Don't ask me why, 'cause I can't say
It's just that way
As sure as the world keeps turnin'
My love for you will never change
Oh, it's just that way
And girl, lovin' you
Is something I was born to do
It's just that way
And girl, lovin' you
Is something I was born to do
It's just that way
That ol' sun comes up every mornin',
It's just that wayYou keep me waitin' till it's gettin' aggravatin' you're a slowpoke
I wait and worry but you never seem to hurry you're a slowpoke
Time means nothing to you I wait and then late again
Eight o'clock nine o'clock quarter to ten
Why should I linger everytime you snap your finger little slowpoke
Why can't you hasten when you see the time's a wastin' you're a slowpoke
Dear why should I keep trying to change you it's not the thing to do
I guess I'll have to learn to be a slowpoke too
[ guitar ]
Why should I linger...Well I felt like I was born today
So I took it upon me to go away
To gather my thoughts and go away
Where I could
(Be used by)
Somebody
Now over the hill, like always you know
Were Billy and Frankie and Henry and Joe
And they beat and broke me hard and slow
To prove I was nobody
And no one I was and so I remained
Knocked-out in a hut, no mother, no name
And filled up my heart with one and the same
That grand dark feeling of emptiness
And was it a friend that turned me loose?
Or was it a girl come to baste my goose?
Or was it my great god who laid on his finger
And started my clock anew?
Ah no, it was rain
Ah no, it was gunning
It was point break and buckle
And singing and cunning
That skinned me, re-skinned me
And started me running
And I never looked back from then on
And now I am learning bit by bit
About to make and model shit
The muddy bowl I live in it
And all the mucks that tire us
And I'm feared if I don't have
A piglet, lamb, or little calf
I'll chop my humanness in half
And be as worm or virus
But kids I've had and they are sung
Upon folks ears my babes are hung
Rhythmically they live among
And grow but don't get old
Not in a box, not in a void
Not if their voice is never heard
Nor if no one repeats a word
But if their tune is told
Then we can age and fall away
To meet again some golden day
And fill it in our happy way
In starlight and in goldI can see you got your eye on this old cowboy
And I can tell you've never had one for your own
Or you've never been around one
Now you're thinkin' that you've found one
Well it might be kinda fun to take him home
You giggle every time that I say yes ma'am
And I get this feelin' if I held you tight
You'd be seein' his and hers
Buckles boots and spurs
But that's a feelin' you'll get over overnight
'Cause what'cha gonna do with a cowboy
When that old rooster crows at dawn
When he's lyin' there instead of getttin' out of bed
And puttin' on his boots and gettin' gone
What you gonna do when he says honey
I've got half a mind to stay
What'cha gonna do with a cowboy
When he don't saddle up and ride away
You can see it takes a special kinda woman
To put up with the life a cowboy leads
'Cause his boots are always muddy
And his beer drinkin' buddies
They'll camp out on your couch and never leave
Don't even start to think you're gonna change him
You'd be better off to try and rope the wind
What he see is what he's got
And he can't be what he's not
And honey you can't hide him from your friends
'Cause what'cha gonna do with a cowboy
When that old rooster crows at dawn
When he's lyin' there instead of getttin' out of bed
And puttin' on his boots and gettin' gone
What you gonna do when he says honey
I've got half a mind to stay
What'cha gonna do with a cowboy
When he don't saddle up and ride away
What'cha gonna do with a cowboy
When he don't saddle up and ride awayCan you smell that McDonell it don't smell so well
Or the one in the cage tipped over and fell
And if we lived to see Sunday be able to tell
Of the terror below and the place we call Hell
'Cause it's a shaft that will feed us and the shaft that will kill
Our brothers and fathers who die by her will
The fishing is slow and there's work to be done
So I'll put on my hat and I'll go underground
Now I fear for my children, I fear for my wife
And if I don't make it back now I've had a good life
For there's a cave in behind us only one way to go
Down deep in the shaft so far below
'Cause it's the shaft that will feed us and the shaft that will kill
Our brothers and fathers who die by her will
The fishing is slow and there's work to be done
So I'll put on my hat and I'll go underground
What do you say to a family of one
Who don't come back up with the rest
Is it better to let them just mourn by themselves
Or tell 'em he was one of the best
There's a flash above head, is it fire or light
McDonell lies seethin' the draggers in sight
And a few hours later we'll be smellin' sweet air
With all of our children the stores we'll share
Of the shaft that will feed us and the shaft that will kill
Our brothers and fathers who die by her will
The fishing is slow and there's work to be done
So I'll put on my hat and I'll go underground
So I put on my hat and I go undergroundJust look at you, girl
Standin' here beside me
Starlight on your hair
Lookin' like a dream
I dreamed somewhere
And look at me, girl
You got me actin' just like a lover
In an old time picture show
And how I got the part
I just don't know
But it's written all across your face
Plain as it can be
You're the one that I was lookin' for
Now you're all that I can see
[CHORUS]
You mean everything to me
And I'd do anything to have you stay forever
I'm an ordinary man
But I feel like I could do anything in the world
When I look at you, girl
Just look at you, girl
Walkin' here beside me
Misty morning light
I see my own reflection in your eyes
And just smile at me, girl
With eyes that tell a story
That words can never say
Tellin' me your love is gonna stay
And we're standin' right together now
In everything we do
And if my world should come apart
I'll still be lovin' youFarther along we'll know more about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
Tempted and tried will oft make you wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested though in the wrong
When death has found and taken our loved ones
Leaving our home so lonely and dreary
Then do we wonder why others prosper
Living so wicked year after yearTake away the bright lights and music take away the power and pain
And you'll find that a honky tonk angel can't compare with your home lovin' saint
She's just another woman who'll never make a home
She's had sweethearts before you she'll have others when you're gone
Don't trade one who loves you for the bright lights that gleam
Don't trade your old fashioned sweetheart for a honky tonk queen
[ guitar ]
She'll lie and she'll cry on your shoulder and she'll speek of a broken romance
She'll say that things might have been different take pitty but don't take a chance
Don't take a cheap imitation when you have a real pearl
Don't take this hard hearted woman for your old fashioned girl
Don't trade one who loves you for the bright lights that gleam
Don't trade your old fashioned sweetheart for a honky tonk queenThere she goes
She&apos;s sittin&apos; on the train
Her face is pressed against the window pane
And from the station I looked her in the eyes
Through the glass I thought I saw her cry
Don&apos;t look away
Don&apos;t look away
In your endless eyes a man can find his way
Don&apos;t look away
Don&apos;t look away
In your endless eyes a man can find his way
When slowly slowly the train was pushing off
And all i knew was that i was desperately in love
but i kept running with my hand up on the glass
cause when its good you&apos;ve got to try and make it last
Don&apos;t look away
Don&apos;t look away
In your endless eyes a man can find his way
Don&apos;t look away
Don&apos;t look away
In your endless eyes a man can find his wayI ALMOST LOST MY MIND

The blues ain't nothin' but a good man feeling bad.
[YODEL}YESTERDAY WHEN I WAS YOUNG
Writers Charles Aznavour, Herbert Kretzmer
Yesterday when I was young the taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue. I teased at life as if it were a foolish game, the way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame. The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned I always built alas on weak and shifting sand. I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day and only now I see how the years ran away. Yesterday when I was young so many drinking songs were waiting to be sung, so many wayward pleasures lay in store for me and so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see. I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out, I never stopped to think what life was all about and every conversation I can now recall concerned itself with me and nothing else at all. Yesterday the moon was blue and every crazy day brought something new to do. I used my magic age as if it were a wand and never saw the waste and emptiness beyond. The game of love I played with arrogance and pride and every flame I lit too quickly quickly died. The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away and only I am left on stage to end the play. There are so many songs in me that won't be sung; I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue. The time has come for me to pay for yesterday when I was young.(Traditional)
Out on the perilous deep,
where danger silently creeps,
and storm's so violently sweeping,
You're drifting too far from shore.
chorus: Drifting too far from shore,
You're drifting too far from shore,
Come to Jesus today,
Let Him show you the way.
You're drifting too far from shore,
Today, the Tempest rose high,
and clouds o'ershadow the sky.
Sure death is hovering nigh,
You're drifting too far from shore.
Drifting too far from shore,
You're drifting too far from shore,
Come to Jesus today,
Let Him show you the way.
You're drifting too far from shore,
Why meet a terrible fate?
Mercies abundantly wait.
Turn back before it's too late
You're drifting too far from shore.
Drifting too far from shore
You're drifting too far from shore (peaceful shore)
Come to Jesus today. Let him show you the way
You're drifting too far from shore.Last week you told me our love was goin' south
So I tried to follow it I tried to track you down
Thought I caught wind of it outside of San Antone
But it was just a ghost so I kept right on goin'
I drove an told myself you wouldn't lie to me
Tears of confusion fell and I wiped them on my sleeve
Two tanks of gas and a floorboard full of coffee cups
I finally hit the border and Mexico was all there was
As I crossed that river the sun was settin'
But I started seein' the light
I walk those streets and I talked to myself
And I decided I would be all right
I drank some Tequila
I said, who needs you
I don't have to do this alone
Me and Mexico are lettin' you go
I bought a big sombrero and made me laugh
Funny I don't think we were ever happy like that
Country full of strangers a thousand miles from home
The first time in a long time that I have felt alone
A band of merry archers was playing in the crowd
I couldn't understand the words but singing right out loud
Here is this border town that's where your memory lays
And when I head back home here's where it's gonna stay
As I cross that river the sun was settin'
But I started seein' the light
I walked those streets and I talked to myself
And I decided I would be all right
I drank some Tequila
I said, who needs you
I don't have to do this alone
Me and Mexico are lettin' you go
I drank some Tequila
I said, who needs you
I don't have to do this alone
Me and Mexico are lettin' you go
Me and Mexico are lettin' you go
(Me and Mexico)
(Me and Mexico)I was in love with your beauty from the day you walked my way
Oh how I wish that was enough to have made me want to stay
See I'm as true as I want to be and I must say my girl
I tried the best to give to you all of the truest in the world
But when I left your house that morning in that ragged Thunderbird
I tried so hard to fight the voices from the devil's that I heard
See there's a highway to the right of us I took it a year ago
And since a year ago can't drive past, without turning down that road
And I knew it,
I never should have turned the wheel
And I knew it,
The voices calling me were real
I knew it
Listen to the song they sing
I knew I was wrong
And I knew I was wrong
So give me a try at describing just how difficult it is
When you kinda love two girls to figure out which one you miss
Stumble away from your stairway with your perfume on my clothes
Well I kinda loved two girls but now I've kinda lost 'em both
And I knew it,
I never should have turned the wheel
And I knew it,
The voices calling me were real
I knew it
Listen to the song they sing
I knew I was wrong
And I knew I was wrong
And if I could gather up the damage that I rendered in my life
Place it on a scale and weigh against the damage done that night
Then it'd be safe to say the weight of all I did and didn't do
Would surely float against the lightest wrong I ever did to youIt's alright with me
If it's alright with you
It's alright I know
Your love will see me through
When the car won't start
The rain won't stop
And all of the bills are due
It's alright with me
If it's alright with you
Well the boss man rides me all week long
And it's all that I can take
I work each day till' the sun is gone
And no time for a break
But when I get home you rub my back
And tell me I'm your man
With a little love I get back on track
And do it all over again
It's alright with me
If it's alright with you
It's alright I know
Your love will see me through
When the car won't start
The rain won't stop
And all of the bills are due
It's alright with me
If it's alright with you
No matter what life throws at me
I've got the upper hand
'Cause nothin' else can set me free
The way your lovin' can
If I lived in the shack out in the woods
And never see me blue
I just throw another log in the old wood stove
And make sweet love to you(For loving you for needing you but most of all for loving you For loving you)
[ Bill ]
For loving you my life is so much richer
You've given so much to live for and I never really lived before before loving you
(For loving you)
[ Jan ]
And for loving you my faith is a little stronger
For a world that could give you to me couldn't be as bad as it's made out to be
There was good there I just could never see before loving you
(For loving you for needing you but most of all for loving you for needing you)
[ Jan ]
And for needing you I feel a whole lot stronger
For there's a strength that comes from knowing you need to give up yourself
And darling I gave so much of myself loving you (for losing you)
[ Bill ]
And now I'm losing you and I'm a sadder lonelier man
Than I ever thought any man could be
But even in my loneliness even as I walk the hunting trail of memory
Even for all the pain that I'm feeling right now
Never once will I ever regret having had the chance of loving you (loving you)What a fool I was to ever let you go
A sweeter love than yours I'll never know
Darling I was so unwise and now I realize
What a fool I was to ever let you go
I'm so lonely as I write this note to you
Sweetheart I know that I still love you true
Now that we are far apart there's a longing in my heart
What a fool I was to ever let you go
Sweetheart I know that I was once to blame
I wonder if you love me just the same
How now worry dear am I I regret the last goodbye
What a fool I was to ever let you go
Oh won't you try to give me one more chance
My darling let's renew our old romance
It will mean the world to me if you'll let me this last plea
Oh my darling won't you give me one more chanceI use to run from the past
But the world got to spinnin' so fast
I run from the future now
I run as fast as I can
Tryin' to be a simple man
I just want to slow down
[Chorus]
Well laugh if you want to
Call me a backwards fool
But I ain't takin' this ride
Ya'll just go on ahead and go
Let me out by the side of the road
All I wanna do is go on home
Don't go online I don't watch TV
Cause I know all I'm gonna see
Is something stupid goin' on
Stupids in the water these days
They're gonna drink it any way
Till they don't know right from wrong
[Chorus]Here's to the corners yet to turn
Here's to the bridges yet to burn
Here's to the whole thing blown apart
It's open season on my heart
Days go by like flying bricks
Leave gaping holes too deep to fix
I'd just stay home if I were smart
It's open season on my heart
I can't blame anyone but me
For this restless fool I've come to be
My tired excuses just don't fit
It don't look good from where I sit
I tried to change without much luck
I reach a point where I get stuck
I hit the streets and the fireworks start
It's open season on my heart
I can't be something that I'm not
I can't give you what I haven't got
I don't know where I'll while away
I only know the shape of you
Here's to the clown down in the mouth
Here's to the whole thing going south
Just stay home if I were smart
It's open season on my heart
I hit the streets and the fireworks start
It's open season on my heartYou give your hand to me and then you say hello
And I can hardly speak my heart is beating so
And anyone can tell you, think you know me well
But you don't know me
No you don't know the one who dreams of you each night
Longs to kiss your lips and longs to hold you tight
To you I'm just a friend that's all I've ever been
You don't know me
I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
The chance you might have loved me too
You give your hand to me and then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away through these tear dimmed eyes
You'll never never know the one who loves you so
You don't know meWhat a beautiful thought I am thinking concerning a great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded on the pages of God's holy word
Desiring to lower her standards they watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teaching but really they find no mistakes
[ steel ]
I am glad I have learned of her meekness and I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing the face of my Saviour's true look
When he comes descending from heaven on the cloud as he writes in his words
I'll be joyfully carried to meet him on the wings of that great speckled birdGOODNIGHT IRENE
Writers Huddie Ledbetter, John Lomax
Irene good night Irene good night Good night Irene Good night Irene I'll see you in my dreams Last Saturday night I got married Me and my wife settled down Now me and my wife have parted I'm gonna take a little stroll downtown Irene good night Irene good night Good night Irene Good night Irene I'll see you in my dreams Some times I live in the country Some times I live in town Some times I take a great notion To jump in the river and drown Irene good night Irene good night Good night Irene Good night Irene I'll see you in my dreams Quit your rambling quit your gambling Stop staying out late at night Stay home with your wife and family And stay by the fireside of right Irene good night Irene good night Good night Irene Good night Irene I'll see you in my dreams Irene good night Irene good night Good night Irene Good night Irene I'll see you in my dreamsBack in the same ol' bar where they said goodbye
Eleven years of lonely bottled up inside
Back in the same ol' bar where her world came to an end
When she caught him with his lover and he swore she was a friend
Now she knows he's got a wife and kids at home
But that didn't seem to stop him eleven years ago
And she'd love to be lyin' in his arms again
he says I'd love to but I can't
She knows he's lyin' and he'll soon be giving in
Cause she's been on the other end
So here's to lying once again
Back in the same ol' bar where they said goodbye
A little age upon her face but she still caught his eye
Back in the same ol' bar where he learned his lesson well
How a night or two of Heaven could turn into a livin' Hell
Now he tries to tell himself he's stronger now
But lookin' in her eyes he starts breakin' down
And he'd love to be lyin' in her arms again
She says I'd love to but I can't
He knows she's lyin' and she'll soon be givin' in
Eleven years of lovin' him
So here's to lyin' once again
Here's to lyin' once againWell I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming
Saying something about a queen
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run in the 20th century
Look at Mother Nature on the run in the 20th century
I was lying in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eye
I was hoping for replacement
When the sun burst through the sky
There was a band playing in my head
And I felt like I could cry
I was thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
Thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There was children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loading had begun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed to a new homeTwo little birdies all in the nest
One little birdie just a-takin his rest
Other little birdie jumps in the sky
Fly little birdie oh fly!
CHORUS
Little birdie why you fly so soon?
Little birdie why you fly so soon?
Has your mama been gone too long?
Has your mama been gone too long?
Crocodile waitin by the riverbend
Hasn't had a meal since I don't know when
Lookin down low, lookin up high
Little birdie tumbles from the sky
CHORUS X2
(Little birdie, little birdie; little birdie, little birdie)
Croc says, "Little fella don't you know
It's dangerous in this world alone.
Tales your mama tells are real
Now you're going to be my evening meal."
Just then come the sound of wings
Momma grabs her birdie and flies.....
CHORUS
Has your mama been gone too long?I dreamt of a suit a suit so fine I dressed my words in
Sewn and tailor made with song in mind made of melody
Stitched by threads of notes with perfect pitch, perfectly composed
Sound in tune and key, a code of rhythm, and harmony
But when I awoke my coat was worn and my words were plain
Each song that I sang all the notes were wrong and poorly played
Both my sleeves had holes, my knees were patched, my shoes needed soles
No clever disguise no way to hide my offensive tone
But I, I wish for you more than I can give, than I can do
Yeah you, you deserve the best an anthem not my hand-me-down tune
Yeah you, you deserve the best an anthem not my hand-me-down tuneWhen you came to me
You said, "Love could not erase
The ever present memory of another face"
I tried to make you love me
How could I be so blind
To think I'd be the one to change your mind"
And if I'm gone before you start
Well you can find me in your heart
Who can say if it's right wrong
I've waited for you too long
And if I can't hold on
I'm gone
When you came to me
I said, "Love will find a way
For every heart that leaves another heart must stay"
I guess you couldn't see
Past the shadow's in the night
It seems the time for us just wasn't right
And if I'm gone before you start
Well you can find me in your heart
Who can say if its right wrong
I've waited for you too long
And if I can't hold on
I'm goneIN CASE YOU EVER CHANGE YOUR MIND
Writer Bill Anderson
RECORDED BY CONNIE SMITH
(I'll be waiting till the end of time in case you ever change your mind
In case you ever change your mind)
She came down from the mansion on the mountain
She kissed you and she handed you a line
I begged you not to go I said darling don't forget me
In case you ever change your mind
Yes the grass grows greener on the mountain
And the berries grow redder on the vine
But the candle still glows in the window in the valley
In case you ever change your mind
Just in case you ever change your mind and long to hold the love you left behind
I'll be waiting till the end of time in case you ever change your mind
(In case you ever change your mind)
Are the stars any bigger on the mountain is the sun any brighter when it shines
Would comin' back to me be like steppin' down from heaven
In case you ever change your mind
Just in case you ever change your mind...
Just in case you ever change your mindWHISKEY LULLABY
Writers Bill Anderson, Jon Randall
RECORDED AS A DUET BY BRAD PAISLEY AND ALISON KRAUSS
She put him out like the burning end of a midnight cigarette. She broke his heart: He spent his whole life trying to forget. We watched him drink his pain away, a little at a time, But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind, Until the night: He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger. And finally drank away her memory. Life is short, but this time it was bigger, Than the strength he had to get up off his knees. We found him with his face down in the pillow, With a note that said: "I'll love her till I die." And when we buried him beneath the willow, The angels sang a whiskey lullabye. La la la la la la la La la la la la la la. La la la la la la la, La la la la la la la. The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself. For years and years, she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath. She finally drank her pain away, a little at a time, But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind. Until the night: She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger. And finally drank away his memory. Life is short, but this time it was bigger, Than the strength she had to get up off her knees. We found her with her face down in the pillow, Clinging to his picture for dear life. We laid her next to him beneath the willow, While the angels sang a whiskey lullabye. La la la la la la la La la la la la la la. La la la la la la la, La la la la la la la. La la la la la la la La la la la la la la. La la la la la la la, La la la la la la la.You've gone so far away, my darling
Each time I think of you I cry
I press your picture to my bosom
Then I feel that you're close by
Years have passed you've not returned dear
Now they say that you have died
But your soul will live forever
Now I know you'll be close by
I saw you last while you were leaving
The tears from you I tried to hide
You took me in your arms and said dear
Your memory I keep close by
They buried you in a lonely graveyard
And a spot they left beside
There I'll sleep 'till Jesus calls us
So that we can be close bySouth of the border, down Mexico way
That's where I fell in love when the stars above came out to play
And now as I wander, my thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way
She was a vision in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while, I kissed the smile upon her face
For it was fiesta and we were so gay
South of the border, down Mexico way
Then she smiled as she whispered manana
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as I whispered manana
For our tomorrow never came
South of the border, I rode back one day
There in a veil of white, by candle light, she knelt to pray
But the mission bells told me, that I mustn't stay
South of the border, down Mexico wayWon't you come with me tonight, where the mooonlight drifts into your eyes, I just want one little kiss, where we high up on the ridgeYou gave me just enough of you to make me want it all
You held me in your arms just tight enough to make me tremble
And the sexy way you looked at me drove me up the wall
I thought for sure I'd die and gone to heaven when you kissed me
You gave me just enough of you to make me want it all
I went home and went to bed and laid awake till morning
And I stared at the telephone just wishing you would call
I've got to slip away with you and feed this gnawing hunger
You gave me just enough of you to make me want it all
You gave me just enough to make me want it all
To lie with you and reach inside and touch your very soul
I'd follow you to anywhere I'd walk I'd run I'd crawl
You gave me just enough of you to make me want it all
You gave me just enough of you to make me want it allI'd been building hopes so long
Honey, I must have lost sight of what went wrong
'Cause in sorrow's blinding light today
Baby, it looks like my dreams were made of clay
Years of yearning spent for you
Honey, I know now were the cravings of a fool
I guess your wants just slipped away
And baby, it looks like my dreams were made of clay
I knew love could toss you down
An' leave you there to crawl around
But never thought that was a fall we'd make
Getting up was nothing new
The kind of thing hearts learn to do
But knowing how doesn't mean it's easy to take
So I'll forget about
Plans we had for me and you
And dwell on thoughts lonely lives pursue
Praying memories don't stay
'Cause baby, it looks like our dreams were made of clay
I knew love could toss you down
An' leave you there to crawl around
But never thought that was a fall we'd make
Getting up was nothing new
The kind of thing hearts learn to do
But knowing how doesn't mean it's easy to take
So I'll forget about
Plans we had for me and you
And dwell on thoughts lonely lives pursue
Praying memories don't stay
Baby, it looks like our dreams were made of clay
Yeah baby, it looks like our dreams were made of clayEvery morning as I start my day
I stop off at Ernie's Corner Stand
He sees me comin' from a half a block away
He's got my mornin' paper in his hand
He probably thinks I read it for the headlines
Just another never-get-enough news junkie
But I round that corner and in no time
Life section D's in hand
The rest is in a garbage can
I still read your horoscope
Cause I can't seem to give up hope
I've got to see what's up with Scorpio
Between that and Capricorn maybe I'll know
What you're goin' through
What I should do
Have you found someone new?
Are you going to?
Today it said that someone from your past
Would give you a call so well, "hi"
And if you feel old feelings comin' back
Don't be surprised it said you might
I know you probably think I'm crazy
Puttin' stock in the stars and the constellation
Ooh but ever since I lost you baby
It's the only thing that I can do
To feel like I'm keepin' up with youPlease listen to me bartender I've got something on my mind
I think I'd might feel better after one more glass of wine
I'm payin' for a broken heart the price of love is high
With nothing left to live for what's there to do but die
(I know your story honey they're all the same you see
Why I knew the minute that you walked in you want to talk to me
But I've learned what you don't read in books from words that cost this bar
I've seen them come and I've seen them drink
Till they don't even know who they are
Now I don't believe that honky tonk is a place for a girl like you
I might be wrong but you don't look right sittin' there on that barstool
It's not too late so stop and think before all of your pride is gone
You can end up like all the rest with a barroom for your home)
I know you're right bartender goodnight I'm going homeDance with me
Dance with me
You can dance every dance
With the guy who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile every smile
For the man who held your hand
Beneath the pale moonlight
So don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me
Dance with me
Oh, I know that the music's fine
Like sparkling wine
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone
So don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me
Baby, don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, never let you go
I love you, oh so much
You can dance, go and carry on
Till the night is gone and it's time to go
If he asks, if you're all alone
Can he take you home
You must tell him no
So don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me
So don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
So don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me
Save the last dance for me
Save the last dance for me
Save the last dance for meI never meant to leave her my intentions were to stay
It wasn't nothing she had done or nothing she could say
To change this old familiar feeling that makes chills run through my skin
Less she read my mind and saw the sings that point around the bend
My toothbrush never leaves my pocket there's no anchor on my feet
If my sleepin' bag gets dusty and there's not enough to eat
I may stay an extra day till I find another town
You can bet there's not a lady that can show this freight train down
And I'll be moving in the morning leaving you behind
If anyone should ask you you can tell them they will find
Somebody walking down the highway with a guitar in his hand
And I'll always be remembered as a free born rambling man
[ guitar ]
Lord tell the children when they find me that I died but not in vain
They can find reincarnation in the whistle of a train
And each time they hear the whistle blow through the stillness of the land
They'll know that I was happy as a free born rambling man
And I'll be moving...(Dolly Parton)
Whenever forever comes, when darkness shall hide the sun
I'll still be shining with love for you
When glory bells chime, my love will ring true
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my love will be yours always
Whenever forever comes, when all things are said and done
I'll still be feeling the same way I do
I'll be there for you and still wanting you
God gave you to me, and me to you
And you will still be the one whenever forever comes
We'll float on a cloud through eternity
You'll gather the stars, you'll give them to me
I'll give you the moon and we'll replace the sun
Whenever forever comes, whenever forever comes
What would I have ever done had I not had you to love?
You've given me more than I ever dreamed
Loving you more every day, so it seems
Greater than all other loves I have seen
Its essence will linger on whenever forever comes
We'll float on a cloud through eternity
You'll gather the stars, you'll give them to me
I'll give you the moon and we'll replace the sun
Whenever forever comes, whenever forever comesAT THE TIME
Writer Bill Anderson
RECORDED BY JEAN SHPEARD AND BY LYNN ANDERSON
I told him that I loved him cause I loved him at the time
And I told him that I didn't want any other lips touchin' mine
I whispered love your kisses are sweeter than the wine
But I'd never tasted champagne at the time
At the time I didn't know your name and I'd never seen your face
At the time I'd never lost myself in your tender warm embrace
If you've never had filet mignon peanut butter taste just fine
And that's the way it was when I loved him at the time
When I found you I started hearing pretty music I'd never heard
And quietly when we spoke of love it was like I'd learned a brand new word
I once thought I'd seen everything but till I met you I was blind
And I wonder now was I even born at the time
At the time I didn't know your name and I'd never seen your face
At the time I'd never lost myself in your tender warm embrace
If you've never had a T-bone steak saltine crackers taste just fine
And that's the way it was when I loved him at the time
If you've never been to Paris France Big Spring Texas will suit you fine
And that's the way I was when I loved him at the timeTOUCH OF YESTERDAY
(Dallas Frazier - Arthur Leo Owens)
'66 Acuff-Rose Music, BMI
I'd beg and steal if I could feel a touch of yesterday
Oh what I'd give if I could live a touch of yesterday
The rain's been falling since he's been gone
It's gonna rain until he come back home
The hurt would leave if I could brieve a touch of yesterday
(A touch of yesterday)
The rain's been falling...
Oh what I'd give if I could live a touch of yesterdayI tried to love you baby
But I couldn't make you happy
And it just really shouldn't be so hard
I gave and you kept taking
You made some big mistakes and
You were always careless with my heart
[Chorus:]
I'm happier now
Ain't it funny how
All it took was leaving you
To finally feel good again
You say you're sorry now
That you figured out
Just what it was that you had to lose
Well it sucks to be you
You used your last chance so
I went and found romance oh
Your eally just can't stand it can you
You see the smile on my face
And it really drives you crazy
Just to see how much better off I am without you
[Chorus:]
I'm happier now
Ain't it funny how
All it took was leaving you
To finally feel good again
You say you're sorry now
That you figured out
Just what it was that you had to lose
Well it sucks to be you
Don't worry baby
I'm sure you'll find someone too
Yeah, who'll put up with you
[Chorus:]
I'm happier now
Ain't it funny how
All it took was leaving you
To finally feel good again
You say you're sorry now
That you figured out
Just what it was that you had to lose
Well it sucks to be you
[Chorus:]
I'm happier now
Ain't it funny how
All it took was leaving you
To finally feel good again
You say you're sorry now
That you figured out
Just what it was that you had to lose
Well it sucks to be you
I'm goneYippee-yay there'll be no wedding bells, for today
I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing, 'Oh ain't you glad you're single
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
Oh, Lily Bell, oh, Lily Bell,
Though I may have done some foolin, this is why I never fell
I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing, 'Oh ain't you glad you're single'
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
Oh, Mary Ann, oh, Mary Ann
Though I've done some moonlight walking this is why I up and went
I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing, 'Oh ain't you glad you're single'
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
Oh, Sally Jane, oh, Sally Jane
Though I'd love to stay forever this is why I can't remain
I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing, 'Oh ain't you glad, you're single'
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
Oh, Bessy Lou, oh, Bessy Lou
Though we've done a heap of dreamin' this is why it won't come true
I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing, 'Oh ain't you glad, you're single'
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
So I'll go jingling, a-jangling a-jingling alongYou knew I'd come around again, baby
I knew you'd let me in again, baby
Neither one of us is strong enough to tell the other one goodbye
Help yourself to me, I help myself to you
What in the world are we gonna do?
Who gives us the right to be wrong one more night?
'Cause my best friend is your husband
And my best friend is your wife
[Chorus]
Don't you know, I hate the way I love it
Don't you know, we got to pull away from it
Don't you know, I hate the way I love it
When I'm wantin' you And needin' you the way I do
I can't stay away from your love
Lyin' here with you tonight, baby
Away from all the city lights, baby
Never feelin' any shame for the game we are playin'
There's a vacancy across the way
Where other lovers just like us will play
For the foolproof alibi that we made up together
But my best friend is your husband
And my best friend is your wife
[Chorus]
(I can't stay away from you
No no no I can't stay away from you)
[Chorus]Time of day I can't recall
The kind of thing that takes it's toll
Over years and over time
Over smiles and over wine
All in all it wasn't bad
All in all it wasn't good
But I still care
That's the problem with the days
They're never long enough to say
What it is you never said
All the books you never read
I throw myself into the wind
Hoping somebody will pick me up
And carry me again
Where are you now
Do you let me down
Do you make me grieve for you
Do I make you proud
Do you get me now
Am I your pride and joy
I believe this to be true
Nothing sacred nothing new
No one tells you when its time
There are no warnings only signs
And you know that you're alone
You're not a child anymore
But you're still scared
All your mountains turn to rocks
All your oceans turn to drops
They are nothing like you thought
Can't be something you are not
Life is not a looking glass
Don't get tangled in your past
Like I am learning not to
Where are you now
Do you let me down
Do you make me grieve for you
Do I make you proud
Do you get me now
Am I your pride joy[ Both ]
He turned the water into wine he turned the water into wine
In the little Canaan town the word went all around
That he turned the water into wine
[ Connie ]
He walked upon the Sea of Galilee well he walked upon the Sea of Galilee
Then he shouted far and wide and he calmed the raging tide
And he walked upon the Sea of Galilee
[ Both ]
He turned the water into wine...
[ Nat ]
He healed the leper and the lame yes he healed the leper and the lame
He said go and tell no man but they shouted it through the land
That he healed the leper and the lame
[ Both ]
He turned the water into wine...
[ Connie ]
He fed the hungry multitude he fed the hungry multitude
With a little bit of fish and bread they said everyone was fed
He fed the hungry multitude
[ Both ]
He fed the hungry multitude he walked upon the Sea of Galilee
He healed the leper and the lame he turned the water into winePardon me if I can't keep my hands off of you
I can't seem to help it you see
Just a touch of your hand is a dream I can't live
Loving you is a way of life with me
If I had to walk along through this world without you
I'd fall like a leaf from a tree
Pardon me if I can't leave your lips alone
I've just got to taste them again
And again and again and again for you see
Loving you is a way of life with me
[ steel ]
If I had to walk along...I wonder if this blade ran through someone's side
The blood wiped away to hide
How evil you grandfather was 'fore he died
But war can make monsters out of us all
I'm sure I'd become one if I was called
And then it would be my blade
Here at this yardsale
The guitar I am holding is way out of tune
The neck it is warped and the saddle is through
I wonder if sweet music ever was played
From the hands of a boy to a girl in the shade
From this rickety ghost of a song
Here at this yardsale
A dollar for anything here on this quilt
A price tag for hands from which all things are built
A blanket of voices speak pleasure in shame
Flowers of plastic and fruit of the same
A basket of nothing at all
Here at this yardsale
So if I had the money I'd buy everything
And cover the whole lot with good gasoline
And burn it for all that I care for the past
And rid mother earth of what never should last
And give her the present of ash
Made of a yardsaleAll the love you promised would be mine forever I would have bet my bottom dollar on
Well it sure turned out to be a short forever
Just once I turned my back and you were gone
From now on all my friends are gonna be strangers I'm all through ever trusting anyone
The only thing I can count on now is my fingers
I was a fool believing you and now you are gone
[ guitar ]
It amazes me not knowing any better than to think I had a love that would be true
Why I should be taken out tarred and feathered to have let myself be taken in by you
From now on all my friends...How many days
How many ways
Do I have to lose you
'Til you're gone?
How many nights
How many lonely nights
Do I have to lose you darlin'
'Til you're gone?
It happens every time
I think I'm gettin' over you
Something 'bout somebody new
Gets me thinkin' about you
How many times
How many times
Do I have to lose you
'Til you're gone?
I see you on the Late Show
I hear you on the radio
Darlin' everywhere I go
Your memory is there
How many times
How many times
Do I have to lose you
'Til you're gone?
(How many times?) I wanna know
(How many times?)
Do I have to lose you Darlin'...'til you're gone?
(How many times?)
How many days.....how many nights.....'til you're gone?
(How many times?) I wanna know
(How many times?) I wanna know Darlin'Down a dirt road down in southern Louisiana
Flew a white Continental with the top laid back
Pretty blond sittin' on a seat of red leather
Dust blowin' out of those well wore tracks
She goin' back
Moss hangin' down like beards in the bayou
Old folks watchin' from a rockin' chair
Ain't no place for a girl of her state
She's gonna ruin her reputation
She don't care 'cause he's waitin' there
She's gonna say
"Tell me you think that I'm pretty
Tell me you think that I'm smart
Tell me anything and I'll believe it
'Cause I'm listening with my heart"
Maybe it's wrong but that's the way it goes
When the only love you get is down
Cheater's road
Bedsprings rubbin' her back through the blanket
Sweat like a tear rollin' down her neck
Watchin' him pullin' down the shades on the window
She'd rather have him than an empty bed
And her self respect
And she says
"Tell me you think that I'm pretty
Tell me you think that I'm smart
Tell me anything and I'll believe it
'Cause I'm listening with my heart"
Maybe it's wrong but that's the way it goes
When the only love you get is down
Cheater's road
Old man countin' his money in the city
Nothin' but the bottom dollar on his mind
The whole situation is a downright pity
He didn't even notice when she crossed that line
When she crossed that line
And she said
"Tell me you think that I'm pretty
Tell me you think that I'm smart
Tell me anything and I'll believe it
'Cause I'm listening with my heart"
Maybe it's wrong but that's the way it goes
When the only love you get is down
Cheater's road
Down cheater's road
Oh tell me you think that I'm pretty
Tell me you think that I'm smart
Oh tell me you think that I'm pretty
Tell me you think that I'm smart
Oh tell me you think that I'm pretty
Tell me you think that I'm smartWell its been a year and there so much to tell
Been doing alright in spite of myself
Just wish I could stop feeling bad when I pray
But I know I'm gonna get there someday
Got that job I was dreaming about
Sometimes its tough traveling around
But who I wanna be still seems so far away
But I know I'm gonna get there someday
glad I told you all I meant to
While I had the chance
Cause every moment I had with you
Made me who I am
by the way, I met someone new
And wouldn't you know, she's a whole lot like you
Still I ain't ready to settle down in one place
But I know I'm gonna get there someday
well I guess I'll be moving on
I'll just leave these daisies by your stone
And momma, I still miss you every day
But I know I'm gonna get there someday
when that'll be, guess only God can say
But I know I'm gonna get there somedayI take the chance to be with you I've tried to live my life the best I can
I've prayed I'd never cheat to heed my heart's command
But dear you know to one I've been untrue
I wonder if you think I'd do the same by you
I take the chance of causing you to doubt my love I take the chance to be with you
I know it's wrong for us to steal a kiss
And when you hold me in your arms oh I can't resist
I have a home and someone kind and true I know I'd lose it all if I was seen with you
I take the chance to lose my soul my life my pride I take the chance to be with youAin't You Wealthy, Ain't You Wise Lyrics
Ain't you wealthy, ain't you wise?
Ain't you made to give to me?
Ain't it all good, enough to sing...
It's a wondrous day to see
The joy I hold in me while I leave
Now you've seen the evil eye,
Hold on to me while i cry
And ain't you wealthy, ain't you wise?
Ain't you made to give to me?
Ain't it all good, enough to sing...
The moon is very low,
It watches while i go
Where i go
Bound in blankets and blond hair,
You'll be shocked to find me there
Ain't you wealthy, ain't you wise?
Ain't you made to give to me?
Ain't it all good enough to sing...
There's no pain to lament
And no dream undreamt
There's no pain to lament
And no dream undreamtAs I sit here tonite the jukebox's playin
The song about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words they are saying
It brings memories when I was a trusted wife
It was not God who made Honky Tonk Angels
As you said in the words of you're song
Too many times married men think, they're still single
And that's why many a poor girl do go wrong
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame
It was not God who made HTA
As you said in the words of you're song
Too many times married men think, they're still single
And that's why many a poor girl do go wrong(bob regan/chris lindsey)
I love the way you move
Like moon light on the sea
The way your body calls me
Like a secret melody
The way you start a fire
When you look into my eyes
The way you always love me
Until I'm satisfied
There are moments
When I love you
Beyond the limits of my human heart
I want to hold you
And take care of you
The way the angels watch over the stars
Past the pull of earth
Across the deep blue sky
Through the universe
Beyond the reach of time
You will always be mine
I don't know how you know
Exactly what I need
I don't how you found
The man I want to be
I don't how your sweet tears
Make me see clear again
I don't how you know
I don't know how you go everywhere I've been
There are moments
When I love you
Beyond the limits of my human heart
I want to hold you
And take care of you
The way the angels watch over the stars
Past the pull of earth
Across the deep blue sky
Through the universe
Beyond the reach of time
You will always be mineAMONG MY SOUVENIRS
WRITERS HORATIO NICHOLS, EDGAR LESLIE
There's nothing left for me of days that used to be There's just a memory among my souvenirs Some letters tied in blue, a photograph or two I see a rose from you among my souvenirs A few more tokens rest within my treasure chest And though they do their best to give me consolation I count them all apart and as the teardrops start I find a broken heart among my souvenirs I count them all apart and as the teardrops start I find a broken heart among my souvenirsWeather's getting cold again
The leaves are falling off the trees
You can almost sense it's time
For jingle bells and wrapping things
Every drive way's full of cars
Kids out of school in the yards
When there's lights on every street
Snowflakes on everything
Well it's just what you've been waiting for all year
When you believe in Santa Claus
When you give gifts just because
And you drive all night only to be near
The ones you love
Well it must be Christmas
All you see is red and green
And people wearing winter coats
Every church has a Nativity
For everyone to see
That's how you know
When there's lights on every street
Snowflakes on everything
Well it's just what you've been waiting for all year
When you believe in Santa Claus
When you give gifts just because
And you drive all night only to be near
The ones you love
Well it must be Christmas
When you believe in Santa Claus
When you give gifts just because
And you drive all night only to be near
The ones you love
Well it must be Christmas
It must be ChristmasNever know how much I love you,
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me,
I get a fever thatÃ¢??s so hard to bear
You give me fever, when you kiss me,
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning, fever all through the night.
Sun lights up the daytime,
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name,
Because, I know your gonna treat me right
You give me fever, when you kiss me,
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning, fever all through the night.
Everybody's got the fever,
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing,
Fever started long ago.
Romeo loved Juliet, Juliet she felt the same,
When he put his arms around her,
He said, "Julie baby you're my thing"
You give us fever, when we kisseth,
Fever with the flaming youth
Fever, I'm on fire, Fever yea, I burn forsooth.
Captain Smith and Pocahontas, had a very mad affair
When her Daddy tried to kill him,
She said, Daddy-o don't do that
He gives me fever, with his kisses,
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses, Daddy won't you treat him right.
Now you've listened to my story,
And here's a point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever,
Be it farenheight or centigrade
They give you fever, when you kiss them
Fever if you live your life
Fever 'til you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn...Talk back trembling lips shaky legs don't just stand there
Don't let him know he's gettin' through to you
Talk back trembling lips burning eyes don't start crying
Heart don't let him know that you're breaking in two
Everyday our love's a battle royal well it seems that fighting's all we do
But if I let you know how much I love you you'd do things to me you shouldn't do
Talk back trembling lips...
[ piano ]
Everytime you up and hurt my feelings I pretend it couldn't matter less
I'm just hiding all of my emotions behind my broken heart I guess
Talk back trembling lips...
Heart don't let him know that you're breaking in twoSacred mem'ries often take me to the place where I grew up
And that little country church that I love so much
I used to go there every time that old church bell would ring
And I remember how I love the songs we used to sing
Like oh Lord you know I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home oh Lord what will I do
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
They were singing Lord I'm coming on when I got saved
And when I got baptized they sang amzaing grace
And oh how sweet the sound when everybody would join in
And sang my favorite song if we never meet again
Where the charming roses bloom forever and where separation comes no more
If we never meet again this side of heaven I will meet you on that beutiful shore
My mama loved to sing and she sang clear and loud
I can close my eyes and I hear mama now
I recall the song my mama always loved so much
She always sang the loudest sangin' power in the blood
Oh there's power power wonder working power in the blood of the lamb
There is power power wonder working power in the precious blood of lamb
Sacred mem'riesI wish to Lord I'd never been born or died when I was young
I never would've seen your sparkling blue eyes or heard your lying tongue
All the good times are past and gone all the good times are o'er
All the good times are past and gone but brother don't you weep no more
[ fiddle ]
Now don't you see that lonesome dove flying from pine to pine
He's mourning for his own true love just like I mourn for mine
All the good times...
[ dobro ]
NBow can't you see that lonesome train going around the bend
It's takin' away my own true love to never return again
All the good times...She met him down at the laundry mat
Three a.m. on a washing machine they sat
And talked until dawn
He bought her breakfast at a small cafÃ©
Morning turned to the rest of the day
Then the day was gone
He thought that she'd surely run away
A fairy tale never started this way, but
It ain't the mind that calls the shots round here
A stronger power's pulled to bodies near
Nothing on Earth can interfere
When love is what the heart wants
They made a wish on the evening star
From a rooftop high above the boulevard
Up in the twilight sky
He held her hand, she held her breath
Two lonely hearts beating scared to death
Of a chance to fly
Giving in to the arms of fate
This isn't quite like the plans that they made, but
It ain't the mind that calls the shots round here
A stronger power's pulled to bodies near
Nothing on Earth can interfere
When love is what the heart wants
It ain't the mind that calls the shots round here
A stronger power's pulled to bodies near
Nothing on Earth can interfere
When love is what the heart wants
It ain't the mind that calls the shots round here
A stronger power's pulled to bodies near
Nothing on Earth can interfere
When love is what the heart wants
Oh
Nothing on Earth can interfere
When love isWhen time was young we walked the roads together
When love was sweet I meant the world to you
Now comes the sun we'll say goodbye forever
And teardrops will kiss the morning dew
Take me and make me your lover one more time
Close in your arms as before
'Til o'er your shoulder the early morning shines
Then I'll leave you and grieve you no more
When time was young we walked the roads together
When love was sweet I meant the world to you
Now comes the sun we'll say goodbye forever
And teardrops will kiss the morning dew
Daises need sunshine and roses need rain
So it was all meant to be
A wild bird needs wings, free to take to the wind
And so it was meant for you and me
When time was young we walked the roads together
When love was sweet I meant the world to you
Now comes the sun we'll say goodbye forever
And teardrops will kiss the morning dew
Teardrops will kiss the morning dewIt's so nice of you to call
To check on me today
It's ironic 'cause after all
You left me this way
You say feel a whole lot better
If I'd at least pick up the phone
'Cause it scares you when you hear my message
"I'm sorry I'm not home"
I'm on the south side of lonesome
I don't know my way back
I am confused and I am broken
Can't believe it hurts this bad
Yeah, the south side of lonesome
It's a little hard to find
But you'll know it when you get here
If you haven't lost your mind
I always did kind of wonder
If we ever were to part
Which one of us would be okay
Which one would fall apart
Well I guess I've got my answer now
It's painful and it's clear
I'm goin' places I have never known
God, it's worse than I ever feared
I'm on the south side of lonesome
I don't know my way back
I am confused and I am broken
Can't believe it hurts this bad
Yeah, the south side of lonesome
It's a little hard to find
But you'll know it when you get here
If you haven't lost your mind
I'm on the south side of lonesome
I don't know my way back
I am confused and I am broken
Can't believe it hurts this bad
Yeah, the south side of lonesome
It's a little hard to find
But you'll know it when you get here
If you haven't lost your mind
Yeah, you'll know it when you get here
If you haven't lost your mind(I can't help it if I'm still in love with you)
Today I passed you on the street and my heart fell at your feet
And I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
[ steel ]
It's hard to know another's lips are gonna kiss you
Oh and hold you just the way I used to do
Oh the heavens only know how much I miss you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
No I can't help it if I'm still in love with youLove, it's true that when it comes to you
I've tried to keep my two feet on the ground
My, it's strange how quickly life can change
You've got my nights and days all turned around
Waited for it, sweet surrender
Waited for it, endless charm
Waited for it, every moment spent in your arms
Sends me right back into the feeling
When the world melts under your touch
And you toss my heart through the ceiling
No reason not to fall in love
Love I've lost, came at so high a cost
Thought I'll be better off just on my own
Then we kissed and all the fun I'd missed
Felt like a thousand ships turning for home
Waited for it, I'd almost given up
Waited for it, believing you would come
Waited for it, every time I think I should run
You take me right back into the feeling
Where the world melts under your touch
When you toss my heart through the ceiling
No reason not to fall in love
I try to think about the consequences
Second guessing with a backward glance
But my brain doesn't stand a chance
Chained to the crazy dreams my heart has
You send me right back into the feeling
Where the world melts under your touch
And you toss my heart through the ceiling
No reason not to fall in love
You send me right back into the feeling
Where the world melts under your touch
And you toss my heart through the ceiling
No reason not to fall in loveI thought I'd seen pretty girls in my time
That was before I met you
I never saw one that I wanted for mine
That was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by its tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
That was before I met you
I wanted to ramble and always be free
That was before I met you
I never saw one that could ever hold me
That was before I met you
They say a man must reap what he's sown
Darlin', I hope that's not true
For once I made plans of living alone
But that was before I met youWriters: George Byron Hill, Mark Eugene Nesler
I'm not sure what I did just yet
Somethin' kicked in on the night we met
Looks like her heart's out of control
What she's gonna do next I don't know
She's already dreamin 'bout a house on the hill
How does she think I'm gonna pay those bills
When all I can afford is a two room shack
Well I took her to the moon and I can't bring her back
Where did my fishin' magazines go
Everywhere I look there is another Cosmo
Flowers in the kitchen and a new bedspread
You tell me it was somethin I said
Well even ol'blue, he's taking it rough
She clipped his nails and she powdered him up
Her minds running on a one-way track
Well I took her to the moon and I can't bring her back
Where's the girl that I used to know
The one who said we'd better take is slow
Tell me which button do I push now
To turn this thing called love around
She goes to the mall but never says why
Brings home things that a man won't buy
I've already told her enuffs enough
What are we gonna do with all this stuff
She bought a bunch of soap that she won't let me use
Toilet seat covers and hand towel too
The kind you don't touch, just leave'em on the rack
Well I took her to the moon and I can't bring her back
She's already dreamin' bout a house on the hill
How does she think I'm gonna pay those bills
When all I can afford is a two room shack
Well I took her to the moon and I can't bring her back
Yeah, I took her to the moon and I can't bring her backThere'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away
Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay with me
Through the tears of the day, of the years
Baby, baby, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)Pray tell, Jessye' Lisabeth
Tell me why you're weeping
Pray tell, Jessye' Lisabeth
When you should be sleeping
What secret are you keeping
Jessye' Lisabeth, pray tell
What could cause such bitter tears
What lesson has life taught you
Hear me sweet and precious one
Look what I have brought you
Here's a star I caught you
For my lady fair star
Pray tell, Jessye' Lisabeth
What can I do for you
Pray tell, Jessye' Lisabeth
Fair maiden I employ you
Oh how I adore you
Your humble servant I remain

I've got a sad, sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep
Where's this place called Lonely Street?
A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Where's this place called Lonely Street?
Perhaps upon that Lonely Street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love die
If I could find that Lonely Street
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Where's this place called Lonely Street?
Where's this place called Lonely Street?I used to see my Daddy every day
He used to race me in the Carolina sun
Back when he was a young man
And he could plow the fields until the day was done
Mama played piano for the choir
Every Sunday afternoon she cooked my favorite things
After church we rode a dozen miles
On old forgotten pathways, now overgrown with trees
Chorus: Home is not the same place that it was
Time goes by andchanges everything
I left so many things behind me
My favorite things I took away
Were my memories and my dreams
Everything I rode would fly
In the woods by the river, and through the fields of hay
Stirring dust and making noise
Across a homemade finish line now lost and gone away
Remember that old dog we used to have
Laying on the front porch when it rained
Sometimes I really miss my old best friend
Buried over in the field where we used to play
ChorusTen thousand words swarm around my head
Ten million more in books written beneath my bed
I wrote or read them all when searchin' in the swarms
Still can't find out how to hold my hands
And I know you need me in the next room over
But I am stuck in here all paralyzed
For months I got myself in ruts
Too much time spent in mirrors framed in yellow walls
Ain't it like most people? I'm no different
We love to talk on things we don't know about
Ain't it like most people? I'm no different
We love to talk on things we don't know about
And everyone around me shakes their head in disbelief
And says I'm too caught up
They say young is good and old is fine
And truth is cool but all that matters
Is that you have your good times
But their good times come with prices
And I can't believe it when I hear the jokes they make
At anyone's expense except their own
Would they laugh if they knew who paid?
Ain't it like most people? I'm no different
We love to talk on things we don't know about
Ain't it like most people? I'm no different
We love to talk on things we don't know about
And after we are through ten years
Of making it to be the most of glorious debuts
I'll come back home without my things
'Cause the clothes I wore out there
I will not wear 'round you
And they'll be quick to point out our shortcomings
And how the experts all have had their doubts
Ain't it like most people? I'm no different
We love to talk on things we don't know about
Ain't it like most people? I'm no different
We love to talk on things we don't know about
Ain't it like most people? I'm no different
We love to talk on things we don't know about
Ain't it like most people? I'm no different
We love to talk on things we don't know about(World sits outside the door)

Yeah
Your lips
Your hips
When you touch em to mine each and every time
I'm hypnotized, I'll admit it
Your moves
Your grooves
It's some heavy stuff, I can't get enough
Girl your love's a drug, I can't quit it
I'm a broke record, a broke record.
You've got my heart-heart skip-skip-skipping a beat
From the needle through my ahead, hit repeat
I'm a broke record, a broke record.
You're a song I gotta sing along with the men
When it gets to the end I gotta play it again and again
My friends, are wearing thin
They're tired of hearing your name
It ain't a healthy thing, this obsession that I'm living
So baby please
Rescue me
I ain't never had nothing stuck in my head
I guess a melody I keep on hearing
I'm a broke record, a broke record.
You've got my heart-heart skip-skip-skipping a beat
From the needle through my ahead, hit repeat
I'm a broke record, a broke record.
You're a song I gotta sing along with the men
When it gets to the end I gotta play it again and again
Like a yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo babe is what I feel like
Up and down, driving me crazy
Keep yank-yank-yanking my string-string baby baby
Don't stop, don't stop
I'm a broke record, a broke record.
You've got my heart-heart skip-skip-skipping a beat
From the needle through my ahead, hit repeat
I'm a broke record, a broke record.
You're a song I gotta sing along with the men
When it gets to the end I gotta play it again and again
Again, again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again, and again(ted hawkins)
Living is good when you have someone to share it with
Laughter is bad when there is no one there to share it with
Talking is sad if you've got no one to talk to
Dying is good when the one you love grows tired of you
Sugar is no good once it's cast among the white sand
What's the point in pulling the gray hairs from among the black strands?
When you're old you shouldn't walk in the fast lane
Oh, ain't it useless to keep trying to draw true love from that man
He'll hurt you, yes just for the sake of hurting you
And he'll hate you if you try to love him just the same
He'll use you and everything you have to offer him
On your way girl
Get out and find you someone new(Jimmy Buffett)
Nibblin' on sponge cake
Watchin' the sun bake
All of those tourists covered in oil
Strummin' my six-string
On my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp hey they're beginnin' to boil
Wasted away again in Margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's nobody's fault
I don't know the reason
I stayed here all season
Nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo
But it's a real beauty
A Mexican cutie
How it got here I haven't a clue
Wasted away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
Now I think
Must be Buffet's fault
I blew out my flip-flop
Stepped on a pop-top
Broke my leg twice I had to limp on back home
But there's booze in the blender
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on
Hang on
Wasted away again in Margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know this is all Alan's fault
Yes and some people claim that there's a woman to blame
And I know it's our own damn faultWell hello there
My it's been a long long time
How am I doin'
Well I guess I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now and it seems that
It was only yesterday
Yeah, ain't it funny how time slips away
How's your new love
I hope that he's doin' fine
I heard you told him
That you'd love him till the end of time
Well you know, that's the same thing
That you told me
Seems like just the other day
Yeah, ain't it funny how time slips away
I gotta go now
Guess I'll see you hanging 'round
Don't know when though
Never know when I'll be back in town
But I remember what I told you
That in time, it's going to be okay
Yeah, ain't it funny how time slips away
Yeah, ain't it funny' how time slips right on, slips right on
Away, away, awayI need you to make me proud
I need electric to play it loud
But I don't need your sympathy
I'm just a player in your kings and queens
I don't want to lose my sight
I don't want to fight my fight
On a big screen TV
I don't wanna burn your money
I need you to get me by
I need electric to get me high
But I don't need your friendly smiles
I'm just the bricks and you're the miles
I don't want to live like you
And I don't want to know your truth
But I'll always do my thing
But you have me on your string
I need you to make me shout
I need electric to drown you out
But I don't need all of your words
I am sound, you can't be heard
I don't want to waste your breath
I don't want you to forget
I'm the problem, you're the test
I can't hear you, none of theseYou'll walk unscathed through musket fire
No ploughman's blade will cut thee down
No cutlass wound will mark thy face
And you will be my ain true love
And you will be my ain true love
And as you walk through death's dark veil
The cannon's thunder can't prevail
And those who hunt thee down will fail
And you will be my ain true love
And you will be my ain true love
Asleep inside the cannon's mouth
The captain cries, 'here comes the rout!'
They'll seek to find me north and south
I've gone to find my ain true love
The field is cut and bleeds to red
The cannon balls fly 'round my head
The infirmary man may count me dead
When I've gone to find my ain true love
I've gone to find my ain true loveJesus, Jesus hold to me
Show me to eternity
Guide me through life's raging sea
Jesus, Jesus hold to me
Loneliness can't enter there
Happiness is everywhere
Singing and shoutin' fills the air
Jesus, Jesus hold to me
Jesus, Jesus hold to me
Show me to eternity
Guide me through life's raging sea
Jesus, Jesus hold to me
Well, now I'm a gonna walk heaven's golden floor
Up there I'll cross that distant shore
Yes, disappointments will be no more
Jesus, Jesus hold to me
Jesus, Jesus hold to me
Show me to eternity
Guide me through life's raging sea
Jesus, Jesus hold to me
Jesus, Jesus hold to me
Show me to eternity
Guide me through life's raging sea
Jesus, Jesus hold to meI guess I should have written Dad to let you know that I was coming home
But I've been gone so many years I didn't realize you had a phone
I saw your cattle comin' in and boy they're looking mighty fine and sleek
I saw Fred at the service station he told me that his wife was awfuly sick
You heard my record on the radio oh well it's just another song
Got a hit recorded and it'll be out on the market 'fore too long
I got this ring in Mexico you know it didn't cost me quite a bunch
When you're in the business that I'm in the people call it puttin' up a front
I know I've lost a little weight and I guess I'm looking kinda pale
If you didn't know me better Dad you'd think that I've just gotten out of jail
No we don't call 'em beer joints night clubs are the places where I work
You meet a lotta people there and no there ain't much chance of gettin' hurt
I'm sorry that I couldn't be here with you all when my Mama passed away
I was on the road and when they came and told me know it was just too late
I drove by the grave to see her boy that really is a pretty stone
I'm glad that Fred and Jan are here it's better than you being here alone
I know you're gonna ask me who the lady is that's sleepin' in my car
That's just the girl that works for me and man she plays a mighty fine guitar
We worked in San Antone last night she didn't even had the time to dress
She drove me down from Nashville and to tell the truth I guess she needs the rest
Well Dad I gotta go we got a dance to work in Cedargrove tonight
Lemme ride your number down I'll call you and I promise you I'll write
Now you be good and don't be chasin' all them pretty women that you know
And by the way if you see Barbara Walker tell her that I said helloYou're the end of the of the rainbow, my pot of gold
You're daddy's little girl to hand and hold
A precious gem is what you are
Your mommy's bright and shining star
You're the spirit of Christmas, my star on the tree
You're the Easter bunny to mommy and me
You're sugar, you're spice, you're everything nice
And you're daddy's little girl
Like angels that sing a heavenly thing
And you're daddy's little girlThe stars & I come out
And hang from up above
The stars shine down their light
I shine down my love
The perfect place to be
To watch you from afar
Do you ever see
How beautiful you areIf I had my life to live over I'd do the same things again
I'd still want to roam to the place we call home
Where my happiness never would end
I'd meet you when school days were onward
And walk through the lanes that we'd knew
If I had my life to live over I'd still fall in love with you
I'd meet you when school days"Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want my Momma cry
Just last year when I was only seven
Now I'm almost eight, as you can see
You came home a quarter past eleven
And fell down underneath our Christmas tree
[Chorus]
"Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
"Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want my Momma cry
"Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want to see my Momma cry
Please Daddy don't get drunk this Christmas
I don't want my Momma cry
I don't want my Momma cry
Mama smiled and looked
Outside the window
She told me son
You better go upstairs
Then you laughed and hollered
"Merry Christmas"
I turned around and saw
My Momma's tears
[Chorus]
No,I don't want to see my Momma cryYou're my everything underneath the sun
You're my everything grow up into one
You're my only dream, my only real reality
You're my idea of a perfect personality
You're my everything, everything I need
You're the song I sing and the book I read
You're a way beyond unbelieved and just to make it real
You're my winter, summer, spring, my everything
You're a way beyond unbelieved and just to make it real
You're my winter, summer, spring, my everythingBeverly packs her lunch pail silently
In the light of the dawn's gray gloom
In her lonely room
Beverly works all day at the factory
On her feet from five to nine
On the assembly line
Beverly drifts away into a reverie
Dreaming of the girl she used to be
When her heart was alive
And there were nights
When Beverly would go out dancing
The stars lit up the Latin sky
Her eyes would flash, her feet would fly
Across the ballroom floor
En una linda noche nosotros bailamos
Dancamos hasta no ver mas las estrellas
Un gran amor - esto fue el pasado
Beverly goes about her way so quietly
And though she cries a little bit
No one seems to notice it
Hmmm, mmm, mmmBury me along the big sandy
Down in those blue gray mountains
Rest my soul in those hills of coal
Until this old earth doesn't tremble
And don't you mourn for me when my soul is free
No woman, don't you cry
You just bury me along the big sandy
Under a blue Kentucky sky
This old town of sin, it's about to do me in
I don't know how much I can stand
With my knees on the street and my heart at their feet
I'm forced to beg from Satan's hand
So bury me along the big sandy
Down in those blue gray mountains
Rest my soul in those hills of coal
Until this old earth doesn't tremble
Don't you mourn for me when my soul is free
No woman, don't you cry
You just bury me along the big sandy
Under a blue Kentucky sky
When I came to this land I was strong and I could stand
Oh but now I've somehow gone astray
Yet I still see the truth in the teachings of my youth
And I know that the Lord ain't turned away
So bury me along the big sandy
Down in those blue gray mountains
Rest my soul in those hills of coal
Until this old earth doesn't tremble
Don't you mourn for me when my soul is free
No woman, don't you cry
You just bury me along the big sandy
Under a blue Kentucky sky
Under a blue Kentucky sky
Under a blue Kentucky skyPointless drinking
Where does it end where to begin
Who are you friends, who are you foes
You'll never know as long as you go
Pointless drinking
Till it seems like they're all speaking poorly in Spanish
Who do you wish would totally vanish
And all you can do
I'm not an actor but I act like I am
I really am awful but I act like I'm not
Pretending my days hold the value of gold
But they only hold one thing and it's all that I've got
Pointless drinking
Keeping my healthy dose of resentment
Keeping me waking with an empty repentance
Keeping me broke, broke as a joke
Pointless drinking
Took all the days that I should have felt young
Took all the joy from the songs I have sung
Took me awhile, took me awhile
Well I'm not a hater, I love you all so
But I look at myself and I don't really know
Can I dig myself out of the wreck of my past
Will I ever unharden and stop showing my ass
Will those eternal bartenders ever stop filling this half-empty glass
Pointless drinking
Hate the effect, even more hate the cause
Hate to admit that I'm tragically flawed
I would keep going but let's pause for the cause
Pointless drinking
Why do you do it, you always go through it
You drink to forget all the times you blew it
Think everyone knows, think everyone cares
Pointless drinking
Keeping you drunk on your dreams of great heights
From the bottom to the top back down overnight
You know it's not right, you know it's not right
Pointless drinking
It's just the one thing you're overachieving
Feels like you never will stop believing
That you'll never win, you'll never winIs yours is mine
Inside misunderstanding lines you have gone
Maybe there's time for something more than what we've done
Wishing not to hold you down with iron binds
Is this day and this time
Is yours is mine
I walked along the walls and there I saw your name
I choose to spend my feelings chance, play the game
The stormy weather passed and left me here to find
That the rain and the shine
Is yours is mine
Is yours is mineWHEN YOUR HAIR HAS TURNED TO SILVER
(Charles Tobias - Peter DeRose)
Â« Â© '53 E.H. Morris & Co Â»
When your hair has turned to silver I will love you just the same
I will only call you sweetheart that will always be your name
Through a garden filled with roses down the sunset trail we'll stray
When your hair has turned to silver I will love you as today
Through a garden filled with roses...There you were standin' in the shadows
Well I just looked where I don't see
I'm still pretendin' I don't need you
I won't let you know you're killin' me
Like some big black widow spider
You know just how to catch your prey
I'm actin' like it doesn't matter
And you sneak up from behind and whisper my name
There goes your paralyzin' eyes
There goes your tantalizin' smile
There goes my act of playin' it cool
And there go the words
I meant to say
There go the games
I wanted to play
There goes my heart fallin' for you
Well I think you're playin' with me darlin'
You like to see what you can do
Well I should be fishin' for Blue Marlin
Instead of being hooked again by you
There goes your paralyzin' eyes
There goes your tantalizin' smile
There goes my act of playin' it cool
And there go the words
I meant to say
There go the games
I wanted to play
There goes my heart fallin' for you
Yeah there goes your paralyzin' eyes
There goes your tantalizin' smile
There goes my heart fallin' for you
There goes my heart fallin' for youFor the millions of lies that you told me and the millions of nights I've waited for you
But you'll find out someday for every wrong you'll pay
And that's when it's comin' home to you
Now you said that you love me and always would be true
But how could you love me and then keep hurtinig me the way you do
For the millions of heartaches you caused me
And the millions of tears I've shed over you
It's all been so unfair but honey someday I won't care
And that's when it's comin' home to you
[ steel - guitar ]
It's never bothered me to see me sit and cry
But you laughed and said thare's for the best that we'll say goodbye
For the millions of heartaches...
And that's when it's comin' home to you(Dolly Parton)
Momma never seemed to miss the finer things in life
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
She never wanted to be more than mother and a wife
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
The only things that seemed to be important in her life
Was to make our house a home and make us happy
Momma never wanted anymore than what she had
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
He often left her all alone
She didn't mind the stayin' home
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
And she never missed the flowers
And the gifts he never gave her
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
Being took for granted was a thing that she accepted
And she didn't need those things to make her happy
She didn't even seem to notice
That he didn't kiss and hold her
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
One morning we awoke
Just to find the note
That momma carefully wrote
And left to daddy
And as he began to read it
Our ears could not believe it
The words that she had written there to daddy
She said our kids are old enough
And they don't need me very much
So I've gone in search for love I need so badly
I have needed you so long
But I just can't keep holdin' on
She never meant to come back home
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
Momma's gone
Good-bye to daddyEvery day, I tell myself, it's temporary
That it's only 'cause she's young
That makes her want... another man
Even though she makes me feel unnecessary
I've found a way to help me understand
I've got this drinkin' thing
To keep from thinkin' things
About where you've been
Who you've been with
What you've done
And it's a lonely thing
But, it's the only thing
To keep a foolish man in love
Hangin' on.
If I wait at home, I'll only ask her questions
She'd probably the truth, so I don't even ask
So, I sit here on this barstool, feelin' helpless
And I wonder, just how long, a man can last
I've got this drinkin' thing
To keep from thinkin' things
About where you've been
Who you've been with
What you've done
And it's a lonely thing
But it's the only thing
To keep a foolish man in love
Hangin' on.
I've got this drinkin' thing
To keep from thinkin' things
About where you've been
Who you've been with
What you've done.If you really want me to I'll go it's not that I want to but I'll go
If you know somebody who could love you more than me
If you really want me to I'll go
I don't know just what you're tryin' to do I only know my love for you is true
Don't tell me that it's over don't tell me that we're through
If you'll leave I don't know what I'll do
I need you more than you know ask me to do anything but go
I can hardly talk afraid I'll cry just don't think that I can say goodbye
Don't tell me that it's over don't tell me that we're through
If you'll leave I don't know what I'll do
[ ac.guitar ]
I need you more than you know...
Don't tell me that it's over...The night wind is sighin' the night bird is cryin' whippoorwill whippoorwill
He calls in the gloamin' to his mate that's roamin' whippoorwill whippoorwill
I sigh with the night wind oh come back my love
I cry with the night bird like some mournful dove
You say just forget me but that bird won't let me whippoorwill whippoorwill

The wind bends the willows all wept with the rain
Your love plays on my heart string that sad sad refrain
You say just forget me but that bird won't let me whippoorwill whippoorwill whippoorwillLove for you has been so strong like a fool I've gone alone
With my feet both planted firmly in the air
I've been so in love with you I've just thought you've loved me too
But at last I'd figured out that you don't care
I've been counting all the time that you told me you are mine
The time you've said how much you care
And I counted all of them on the fingers of one hand
And I still have five fingers to spare (yes I still have five fingers to spare)
Since I counted one by one and the answer came to none
I don't think you love me any maybe less
And if what I think is true nothing's good enough for you
And so I'll just give you nothing after this
I've been counting all the timeGirl, I've made a name everybody writes off
An open-road, hard case; a honky tonk, lost cause
The fate I'm lookin' at, there ain't know way around
A long and lonely path I'm destined to go down
[Chorus]
Yeah, there ain't much of nothin' in me
Left to be saved, but, baby, I bet
If you could love somebody like me
There might be hope for me yet
Hope for me yet
Always livin' fast, and only thinkin' short term
I never could get past a bridge I didn't burn
I'm just a worn out pair of boots and a beat-up old guitar
A handful of country tunes and a hard-luck kind of heart
[Chorus]
Girl, you just might be that outside chance for me
Yeah, you're the one good shot at redemption that I've got
Yeah, there ain't much of nothin' in me
Left to be saved, but, baby, I bet
If you could love somebody like me
There might be...
[Chorus]
Hope for me yet
There's hope for me yetYou brought me happiness
When I had none
Made me believe that I
Could be someone
Just like the sun you always shine for me
What am I gonna do
Now that I don't have you Marie
You over looked the fuss that others saw
You said they only made
You love me more
Some said it proved how blind
True love can be
What am I gonna do
Now that I don't have you
Marie
A traveler with no star
To guide me
A love song in search of a key
A prisoner of love
Locked inside me
Beggin to be free
Oh I lost it all
When I lost you
Marie
You where the sparkle
In this old fools eyes
And now my heart begins
To realize
Your love will turn into a memory
Where am I gonna go
After loving you so
MarieHere we stand at the end of paths taken
Guiding light inspiration, the slow decline
The crumbling foundation, the stations and now the cross
But we're still lost, we're still lost
Settling now once again
What was begun will meet it's end
Running now, time to hide
Go inside, it's time to hide
Here we stand at the end of paths taken
Guiding light inspiration, the slow decline
The crumbling foundation, the stations and now the cross
But we're still lost, we're still lost
Waiting now, dull roots twinning
Keeping watch for new roots shining
Here we stand at the end of paths taken
Guiding light inspiration, the slow decline
The crumbling foundation, the stations and now the cross
But we're still lost, we're still lost
There you stand at the edge of salvation
Guiding light inspiration, the slow decline
The crumbling foundation, the stations and now the cross
But we're still lost, yeah, we're still lost
But we're still lost, we're still lost
But we're still lost, yeah, we're still lost
But we're still lost, we're still lost(instrumental)Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you
Jolene
He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name
Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me
Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me
Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do
Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Jolene, JoleneOut here on the backside of that city limit sign where the world turns two lanes
Pretty girl working at the bank and the fella toppin' off your tank knows your name
Water tower, power lines, swimming holes rusty old RC cola sign
And county fairs, raise your hands up if you've been there
Where there's biscuits, grits and gravy and the waitress calls you baby
And the starlight's like a streetlight on a summer night.
We say hell ya and amen, yeehaw, and y'all come back again
And pray that our boys come home alive
And when Old Glory flies, we still hold our hands over our hearts
Where there's more trucks than cars.
Well, I've been there on the concrete of them big city streets
In my Ford truck, traffic jam in the town square
Told my buddies living up there, good luck
Meanwhile back in Tennessee we're raising our babies and our own green beans
Kicking up dust, come on down when you had enough
Where there's biscuits, grits and gravy and the waitress calls you baby
And the starlight's like a streetlight on a summer night.
We say hell ya and amen, yeehaw, and y'all come back again
And pray that our boys come home alive
And when Old Glory flies, we still hold our hands over our hearts
Where there's more trucks than cars.Your best friend, your best girl just made a big messy world
'Cause arm in arm they left you feelin' blue
She set a trap, you got caught
You should've took her with a grain of salt
So have a little faith and love will come to you
So she's leavin' for somebody new
She's even got you believin' there's nothin' you can do
But brush that teardrop off your face
And put a smile back in its place
Just have a little faith and love will come to you
Beyond the clouds the sky is always blue
Have a little faith and love will come to you
So don't be lonely and don't be blue
Your one and only is somewhere waiting just for you
Two lovin' arms to hug your neck
Right around the corner where you least expect
She'll be there with love to pull you through
Just have a little faith and love will come to youAmarillo by morning
Up from San Antone
Everything that I've got
Is just what I've got on
When the sun is high
In that Texas sky
I'll be bucking it to county fair
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo I'll be there
They took my saddle in Houston
Broke my leg in Sante Fe
I lost me a wife and a girlfriend
Somewhere along the way
Well I'll be looking for eight
When they pull that gate
And I hope that
Judge ain't blind
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo on my mind
Amarillo by morning
Up from San Antone
Everything that I've got
Is just what I've got on
I ain't got a dime
But what I've got is mine
I ain't rich
But Lord I'm free
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo's where I'll be
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo's where I'll beCastles tall
Houses small
Left alone
All fall down
Dreams so clear
Disappear
Without a sound
All fall down
Lovers meet
Lovers quarrel
Lonely boy
Lonely girl
I lost him
And I have found
Dreams like walls
All fall down
All fall down
All fall down
She don't want me to call her
And she's told me not to bother comin' round
All fall down
All fall down
When you take a love for granted like I did
You're bound too see it all fall down
Castles tall
Houses small
Left alone
All fall down
Dreams so clear
Disappear
Without a sound
All fall downOne frozen night in 1914 at the height of World War One
The unthinkable happened
All along the entire western front
The British and German soldiers lay down their weapons
In an unofficial cease fire to celebrate Christmas Eve together
They exchanged gifts and saw each other as brothers
And that peace lasted for two more days
When they were ordered back to battle
In those few days, though
Men remembered the reason for Christmas
Amongst the devastation
And it's a story that should never be forgotten
Through the smoke filled night
Silence rolls from both sides
Across a bloody battlefield
It was a cold Christmas Eve in 1914
For those who were there it seemed unreal
As time was still, the spirit moved the soldiers
To lay down their arms, raise their voice in song
And pretend for a while the war was over
If it could happen then, it could happen again
A world torn apart to join hands and hearts
To celebrate His birth, peace on this earth
If for one magic night, we could find again a reason not to fight
Maybe, there's a chance, this time it might last
As opposing sides approached
Through broken words they spoke
It wasn't long before they felt at ease
They shared their cigarettes
What they had they used as gifts
They didn't feel like enemies
With candles lit, they stood shoulder to shoulder
And on that field they found true common ground
And as they prayed, they dreamed the war was over
If it could happen then, it could happen again
A world torn apart to join hands and hearts
To celebrate His birth, peace on this earth
If for one magic night, we could find again a reason not to fight
Maybe, there's a chance, this time it might last
If it could happen then, it could happen againHe's not lookin' for your kind of love
I got a hand in his heart like a fist in a glove
You say you're strong
Well, tough you better be
When he's lookin' for a fight he
Always comes back to me
[Chorus]
'Cause one good lover deserves another
I'm one good lover, one good lover
He's just lookin' for a friendly smile
He got a look in his eye like
A Prisoner with a file
He don't love you, he don't even know your name
It takes two to tango
Three to lose the game
[Chorus]
Try it one more time with feeling
But you can't hurt him like I can
Like I can
Like I can
One good lover deserves another
He's not lookin' for your kind of love
He likes a take and a give, likes a pull and a shove
You're experienced, advice is what you need
Listen closely I've got two words for you for free
[Chorus]You wouldn't believe the number of times
I've heard somebody say
How come some guy, some handsome prince
Hasn't swept you away
But I take off on that tour bus
A different city every night
And doing what I love to do
Makes it hard to be a wife
Well you wouldn't believe the number of times
I've been asked that myself
Folks can't understand why a heart like mine's
Still on a shelf
But I'm married to my music
And I have been most my life
That makes it hard to be a husband
That makes it hard to be a wife
Ã¢??Cause I'd rather play the grand ol' opry
Then go to dinner and a movie
Right now I'm not thinking Ã¢??bout a family of my own
Ã¢??Cause the band's on stage
And I'm late for my show
There's folks that think my life is lacking
Because my time at home is usually spent packing
They might assume that I don't have a clue what love's about
Oh but I know love
That I have no doubt
Ã¢??Cause you wouldn't believe the way it feels
To hear somebody say
Your song sure means a lot to me
It got me through a real tough day
If hearing words like that means givin' up my social life
Then I got all the friends I need on that front row
And I got all the friends I need on that back row
And we can't see those folks unless we're never home
And that makes it hard to be a wife
And hard to be a husband
And that makes it hard to be a wifeWell it seems like it eats up most of my time
It does the same for most mankind
But you meed some nice folk standin' in line
And that's what I like about love
It's a good intention or a bad excuse
A tire swing or a hangin' noose
It'll tie you down or it'll cut you loose
And that's what I like about love
That's what I like about it
There ain't no room for those who doubt it
You're damned if you
And you're damned if you do without it
But that's what I like about love
It's barbie dolls and baseball bats
Hot dogs on the grill out back
And seven shoes on a welcome mat
That's what I like about love
That's what I like about it
There ain't no room for those who doubt it
You're damned if you
And you're damned if you do without it
But that's what I like about love
Well it's a blanket when the wind gets cold
And it's a walking cane when you're growing old
And it's the best part of every story told
And that's what I like about love
That's what I like about it
There ain't no room for those who doubt it
You're damned if you
And you're damned if you do without it
But that's what I like about love
That's what I like about loveI just come into this bar
To have a quick one
Maybe give the bowling game a whirl
Well you sat down next to me
And in a minute I could see
That you're a complicated kinda girl
You say there's someone home waitin' for you
But you don't really care much if he cares
If you're prayin' for a chance
Had a really big romance
I don't think I'm the answer to your prayers
'Cause I've got all the heartaches
I can handle back at home
I got all the pain and sufferin' I can use
While I thank you for your gracious invitation
I'll call you when I'm runnin' short to blues
It's true that you might love me
More than she does
And we might be a whole lot more than friends
But I might start to love you as much as he does
And then you'd be out looking once again
I've been traveling down
Love's rocky road a long time
And I guess that I should know a danger sign
So you stay here try to drown your trouble
And I guess I'll go walking home to mine
'Cause I've got all the heartaches
I'll call you when I'm runnin' out of blues6 A.M and Bobby's wakin' up
Rolls outta bed with sleepy eyes
Goes to his sister's room across the hall
'Hey Daisy rise and shine'
He pours two bowls of Captain Crunch
Puts a fresh pot of coffee on
He wakes his momma up off the couch
The bus is here we love you mom
He made the breakfast
He did the dishes
So she wouldn't have to
[Chorus]
Oh he's only ten
This comin' of age he ought to be out playin' ball
And video games
Climbin' trees
Or on a bike just ridin' around
But it's hard to be a kid
When you're the man of the house
It's late at night and Larry King is on
Momma's up on the couch again
Bobby hears them all talk about
That awful war his daddy's in
So he runs off, straight up to his room
Don't want his momma to see him right now
He climbs in bed and says a silent prayer
Then he cries his little blue eyes out
Don't wanna let her down
[Chorus]
It's finally Saturday
Bobby gets a phone call
Another world away from home
He says, 'I love you dad'
Daddy says it right back
Wish I could reach through this phone
And hug you, and Daisy, and your mom
I'm so proud of you son.'
[Chorus]
It's 6 A.M and Bobby's wakin' up
Rolls outta bed with sleepy eyesIf my years were less if my shoes were new I'd pack my things and I'd leave you
Hitch myself to some westbound train you'd never see me again
If I could dream as I once could I'd be gone it'd good
I don't want to live have never try in some old house where love has died
We once had love but it's gone now don't know when don't know how
We're two strangers under one roof no need to lie that's the truth
Love has gone there's nothing left I wanna leave can't help myself
Don't want to live have never try in some old house where love has died
Too many ghosts walk the floor ghosts of the love that ain't no more
I'd like to have what we once had ain't no way that's too bad
Cause you're too much a part of me for me to be ever free
So we'll keep living and neither tryin' in some old house where love has diedIt's been here since you've been gone it's been hanging round too long
A thing called sadness not much of a friend when you walked out it walked in
It's in every chair where I sit down it follows me all over town
A thing called sadness not much of a friend when you walked out it walked in
What in the world am I going to do this old friend can't take the place of you
It only brings back memories of you and all the things that we used to do
It's in every chair where I sit down it follows me all over town
A thing called sadness not much of a friend when you walked out sadness walked inI'm not one to just open up my mind
I'd rather let somebody else do the talkin' most of the time
I don't have much to say
But how many words does it take
I love you and I want to
With every single breath - enough said
I won't try to be someone that I'm not
But I know a woman likes to hear sweet nothing things a lot
So I'll do the best I can
I'll keep sayin' this over and over again
I love you and I want to
With every single breath - enough said
Don't ever think that I don't
I love you and I want to
With every single breath
I love you and I want to
With every single breath
Enough saidI remember working on a rooftop
In the hot summer sun all day
Now I work two hours a night
It feels a lot more like play
'Fore Kenny joined the band
He used to hang dry wall
Ben worked down at Valentino's
So when you see us up here and think
Man they're lucky
You don't have to tell us 'cause we know
[Chorus]
Yeah, we're laughing all the way to the bank
'Cause it all just seems so funny
A bunch of guys like us
In a big tour bus
Making that easy money
Desperado hauled cattle
Grady drove trucks
Justin had a hotdog stand
Kevin sold records
And Brent sold shoes
And Gary was a garbage man
[Chorus]
I used to have an ex-girlfriend
That didn't understand
She said, "Boy you're going nowhere fast
You oughta get a real job
Why don't you quit that band?"
Now she can kiss my backstage pass
[Chorus: x2]It's the sweetest thing
Now I've finally found him
I'll never be the same
No I don't mind the pain
When it hits I miss him
I long to kiss him again and again
It's the sweetest thing
When he means what he means
Believe the unbleievable
It's highly conceivable
It's yours for the asking
And times everlasting it's good so good
Now you're the only man
Man enough to love me
The only man one and only one can
It's you and me
We'll be like cats up a tree
We can fall through the air
They can't touch us when we're up there
We're silent partners we make sweet company
It's a patient love that waits patiently
For the sweetest thing
The only love is waiting there for me
Oh you're the only man
Man enough to love me
The only man one and only one can
It won't go away
Now it's here now it's gonna stay
Once and for all that's enough
For a lifetime
We're silent partners we make sweet company
It's a patient love that waits patiently
For it's the sweetest thing
The only love waiting there for meTake off all the makeup girl
Shine your light, show the world
Don't be shy, don't be scared
You don't have to hide under there
Let's throw away all the magazines
Turn off the static on the TV
Wish you could see yourself the way I do
Nobody ever told you
Nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond
Glitter like a gold
And you need to know
What nobody ever told you
Yeah
La la la la la
Mirror mirror on the wall
Acting like he knows it all
Tells you lies of vanity
He doesn't care what's underneath
All hung up on the negative
Doesn't have to be the way it is
Wish you could see yourself the way I do
Nobody ever told you
Nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond
Glitter like a gold
And you need to know
What nobody ever told you
Free as a bird,
Up on a watch
Just like a flower growing wild
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
Nobody ever told you
Nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond
Glitter like a gold
And you need to know
What nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond
Glitter like gold
And you need to know
What nobody ever told you
Oh you're free as a bird up on a wire
Just like a flower growing wild, just like a flower growing wildSlowly I'm falling more in love with you
And slowly you're winning a heart that can be true
Now I can't hide my feelings no matter what I do
Slowly I'm falling more in love with you
More and more I need you and want you by my side
More and more I love you as each day passes by
No I can't hide my feelings no matter what I do
Slowly I'm falling more in love with you slowly
I'm falling more in love with youLast night I had a blue dream cause in my dream you told me we were through
I cried cause in my blue dream I saw you away with someone new
And then beside the blue stream I saw him makin' a fairy love to you
Last night it was just a blue dream
But tonight I'm blue because my blue dream came true
[ guitar ]
And then beside the blue stream...There's music in the city
And the lights are on display
There's a big old tree for all to see
Where the children run and play
I look out through my window
Somethin' just don't seem right
TiIl I said hello and heard her voice
On the other end of the line
Now it's Christmas, Christmas I'm hurrying' on my way
Christmas, Christmas, like I'm riding in a one horse sleigh
Well, I don't have to hear no jingle bells, just the ringing of the phone
Mama just called and said it's time
For me to come home
The pies are in the oven
You can almost taste the air
And it warms my heart to feel her love
And know how much she cares
It's funny how going back can get you back where you belong
It's the difference between in just a melody and my favorite Christmas songThe bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely girls like me
A cabarete a honky tonk their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights
Lights that say forget his name in a glass of cherry wine
Lights that offer other guys for empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights
Lights that say forget his love in a different atmosphere
Lights that lure are nothing but a masquerade for tears
They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
And I just can't say I love you to a street of city lightsAlone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh Lord if you hear me please hold to my hand please understand
We met in the springtime when blossoms unfold
The pastures were green and the meadows were gold
Our love was in flower as summer grew on
Her love like the leaves now has withered and gone
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh Lord if you hear me please hold to my hand please understand
The roses have faded there's frost at my door
The birds in the morning don't sing anymore
The grass in the valley is starting to die
And out in the darkness the whippoorwills cry
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh Lord if you hear me please hold to my hand please understand
Oh where has she gone to oh where can she be
She may have forsaken some other like me
She promised to honor to love and obey
Each vow was a plaything that she threw away
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh Lord if you hear me please hold to my hand please understand hold to my handI watch you most every night see you in the front porch lights
You and him sittin' in a swing radio playin' through the screen
Wilma Lou Wilma Lou don' let that boy put his hands on you
I can see he ain't your kind he loves your body and not your mind
Every night I watch you hard a hidin' here in the wreckin' yard
Sittin' in a rusty truck lettin' mosquitoes eat me up
Wilma Lou Wilma Lou
Oh Wilma Lou you're too far away so I sneak up behind his Chevrolet
I hunker down here in the weeds a little closer so I can see
I hear the June bugs in the night see you in the front porch light
I'm goin' home I've had enough God sake Wilma Lou get up
Wilma Lou Wilma Lou
Wilma Lou Wilma LouI need a room without a view
So nothing I see will remind me of you
Just four grey walls
To keep out the light of day
Must be a place that I can go
Where I can't look outside and know
That I'm the fool
That let you slip away
Closing my eyes won't do
I need a room without a view
If I had a room without a view
I'd have to pad all the mirrors too
Because what they show
Is just as hard on me
Don't wanna face the fact you're gone
Don"t wanna see another sunset alone
Cause when you're not here
Who needs the scenery
If I'm gonna make it through
I need a room without a view
Every thing from stars to sunlight
Or the wind blowing through the trees
Brings back the memory
Of a love that we shared
Pull the shades and draw the curtains
Board up the windows too
To get over you
I need a room without a view
Pull the shades and draw the curtains
Board up the windows too
To get over you
I need a room without a view
Oh yes I do
I need a room without a viewTHIS OLE SUITCASE
(Bill Anderson)
'77 Stallion Music
(I want to respectfully dedicate this next song
To every man that ever drove a truck
Every travelin' salesman whoever rode the highways
And every guitar picker whoever chased a dream
And ended up in a motel room starin' at four walls talkin' to himself
Feelin' like the only friend he's got in this world is his ole suitcase)
She's been my pillow when I've needed a place to lay my weary head
She's been my blanket when the ground beneath my body was my only bed
She's been the table where I've dined on T-bone steak and cheep red wine
I've shared the gravy and the grind with this ole suitcase mhm
She's been my traveling companion
When the road stretched out in front of me for miles
She's had to catch my salty tears
But she's been around to see my happy smiles
I sing her my songs in their unfancy and she listens patiently
I've carried her and she's carried me this ole suitcase mhm
And the people who don't know
Say Lord ain't it hard livin' out of a suitcase
And I guess if you ain't been there
You might not understand it but it's my case
She's been my traveling companion
When the road stretched out in front of me for miles
She's had to catch my salty tears
But she's been around to see my happy smiles
From New York City to Kangka Ki in a 707 or in a GMC
I've carried her and she's carried me this ole suitcase mhm
From New York City to Kangka Ki in a 707 or in a GMC
And when I die just bury me in this ole suitcase mhmTHE BLUES DON'T CARE WHO'S GOT 'EM
WRITERS WAYLAND HOLYFIELD, DICKEY LEE
Chorus:
Well the blues don't care who's got 'em
Tears don't care where they fall
And you don't care my heart is breaking in two
No you and the blues don't care at all
Outside my window
It's raining
Somehow the rain seems right
Inside my lonely heart is aching
Oh how I miss you tonight
Repeat Chorus
The wind don't care where it's blowing
Rivers don't care where they flow
I don't know where I'm going
Cause you don't care anymore
Repeat Chorus
Oh darling you and the blues don't care at allI wish I could come back to you dear cause I know that you want me to
But too much waters run under that old bridge
And there's too many rivers between me and you
There's too many rivers to cross dear and too many dreams have been lost
And there's too many long nights that I've turned and I've tossed
There's too many rivers to cross
[ steel - ac.guitar ]
Now don't think for a moment that I blame only you
For we both killed the fruit on the vine
And when you try to put love back together
There's always a few little pieces you can't find
Lord there's too many rivers...You've cried the last tear you're gonna cry
You've kissed your last lips that cheat and lie
Forget him, baby, he's just not worth hurtin' for
Your heartache's over; it's all gone
I'll make you happy from now on
And no one's gonna hurt you anymore
You've been mistreated, neglected and cheated out of the love you should have had
But give me a while, and I'll make you smile for the times he's made you sad
You've cried the last tear you're gonna cry
You've kissed your last lips that cheat and lie
Baby, no one's gonna hurt you anymore
Don't be afraid, darling, come to me
Cling to me, and I'll kiss away all of your tears
Here in my arms you'll be safe from harm now and for all the coming years
Your heartache's over; it's all gone
I'll make you happy from now on
No one's gonna hurt you anymore, baby
No one's gonna hurt you anymoreThere's dust on mother's Bible its pages are worn with age
And though it's old and wrinkled mama's there on every page
The night the angels called her mama called me to her side
And she handed me her old Bible said son let this be your guide
Now I picked up mama's old Bible and to my heart I pressed it tight
And I thought I could hear her whisper ever so gently
Son I'll meet you on the other side
I kissed my mama's old Bible and I wiped away the dust
Oh you'll never know until she's gone how you miss your mother's loveShe stepped out of the Taxi, with a suitcase in her hand
And a hand bag too full for her to hold
I felt her body tremble as I took her in my arms
And she whispered, don't ever let me go
[Chorus]
The I watched her hang her dresses up and close the closet door
And I watched her put her satin things away
Somehow now I know she won't be leaving anymore
I do believe forever's here to stay
It's good to hear her foot steps just walking down the hall
Lord, I wondered would I hear those sounds again
We're picking up the pieces, and putting away the past
We've got a lot of broken dreams to mend
[Chorus]So this is love, this is what it feels like
To need someone more than life
I never knew it could be this passionate, so intense
I've got so much to lose, I can't even think about it
[Chorus]
I don't want to experience how it would feel
To live one second without you here
Left without your kisses wanting more
Not to hear your heartbeat, like before
What would I do, where would I go
If you were gone and I had to move on
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I had a dream someone up above us
Called your name in the name of love
And I cried as heaven took you on angel's wings
I woke up and screamed
"God in heaven above, don't take her from me"
[Chorus]
And when we touch let's make love like it was our first and last time
And when we part cross, your heart and swear on love it's not goodbye
[Chorus]I'm traveling down this lonesome road, oh, how I hate to go
The wind and storms are raging high and it's awful cold
My mind drifts back to you, sweetheart, and I love you so
Now you've gone and left me here to travel this lonesome road
I remember dear, not long ago, you said you'd be my own
I never thought you'd go away and leave me all alone
The kind of love you had for me, I find sweetheart, grows cold
For now you've gone and left me here to travel this lonesome road
I'm traveling down this lonesome road, oh, how I hate to go
The wind and storms are raging high and it's awful cold
My mind drifts back to you, sweetheart, and I love you so
Now you've gone and left me here to travel this lonesome road
All I do is roam around and look for you, my dear
I know I'll search ten thousand miles, oh, how I need you, dear
You broke my heart, you left me here, now I'm growing old
Why did you go and leave me here to travel this lonesome road?Heart to heart, dear, how I need you
Like the flowers need the dew
Lovin' you has been my life blood
I can't believe we're really through
Is it true that I've lost you?
Am I not the only one?
After all this pain and sorrow
Darlin', think of what you've done
I look back to old Virginia
Where the mountains meet the skies
In those hills I learned to love you
Let me stay there till I die
Is it true that I've lost you?
Am I not the only one?
After all this pain and sorrow
Darlin', think of what you've doneCome, they told me pa-rum pum pum pum

Joy to the world( Drag City Supersession album )
Even as the sun
Paints the landscape with its fire
It seems the storms they follow me
Wherever i go
I may perish never knowing why
I'm thinking about
Leaving the army
Turning in my uniform
As always awakened
By the old explosions
Just outside of my door
Even as the stars
Paint their icons up against the sky
It seems that i'll be blinded
To their travels tonight
That's just what my life is like(Dolly Parton)
There will come a day when sorrow fades away,
And anguish and heartache shall ease,
No mothers cryin', no soldiers dyin',
And turmoil and misery shall cease.
The hungry shall be fed, the aimless shall be led
And sad eyes will no longer weep,
The last shall be first, through heaven he'll burst
With his heavenly host from the East
Weapons to plowshares, hate turns to love,
Descending from heaven he'll sweep down to us
In radiant splendor; oh, won't it be sweet
When the raven of darkness turns into a white dove of peace
(Raven dove)
Oh, there will come a day when I'll fly away
Forever to be in his keep
Eternal life in the sweet by and by
When raven dove, raven dove speaks
When lambs walk with lions, a child tames the beast
Nations shall gather and bow at his feet
And loved ones shall rise up from their earthly sleep
And he'll separate all the chaff from the wheat.
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, how sweet
When the raven of darkness turns into a white dove of peace
Raven dove, behold he cometh in the clouds
And every eye shall see him
Sweet bird, sweet bird of peace
Raven DoveDreamin' is only dreamin'
'Til dreamin' is the only thing that's true
Yeah wishin' is only wishin'
Till my only thoughts' the wish to be with you
I've got a long way to go before I get there
I've got a lot of field to hoe with the sun so high
Got a lot of miles to roll
And the next few only show
That there is still such a long way to go
Hopin' doesn't feel like hopin'
If I can feel your heart hopin' too
Oh touchin' doesn't feel like touchin'
Until I feel the next touch from you
I've got a long way to go before I get there
I've got a lot of field to hoe with the sun so high
I've got a lot of miles to roll
And the next few only show
That there is still such a long way to go
Wanting just keeps me wanting
The next and last both keep me wanting you
Oh and waiting just keeps me waiting
Until there's no more waiting left to do
I've got a long way to go before I get there
I've got a lot of field to hoe with the sun so high
I've got a lot of miles to roll
And the next few only show
That there's still such a long way to go
Oh I've got a lot of miles to roll
And the next few only show
That there's still such a long way to goI should have known that you were trouble when
I heard the words my sister said
she told me that you were spoiled - rotten to the bone
I suppose that I was blind
by lovesick words and happy times
if only I'd listened to my sister I'd have known
that I am worthy of love
and I deserve to be loved
the sad song has resound in you
your shallow heart and pounding too
turns you into driftwood
not caring where you go
but don't assume you're too far gone
to rise above and change your song
passion never leaves but you must keep it on the stove
I am worthy of love
I deserve to be loved
I spent the last week empty
been all attain a craving in my chest
because an angel had left me
and all I ever gave her was my best
I am worthy of love
I deserve to be loved
I'll put the cap back on this pen
And I will close this book again
I'll pick up the pieces and I'll wait till the day
The waters of this world will rise
by noon it will be past my eyes
I'll break off from you and drift away
I am worthy...
I deserve...I can't say I don't love her
Still I can't pretend
My heart is torn just knowing that
I'm losing my best friend
If it's easier said than done
Then someone tell me why
Though I try
I can't find the words to say goodbye
I can tell her that I'm sorry
And hope she'll understand
And she'll have to do with someone else
All that we had planned
I'd rather her hear the truth
Than hurt her with a lie
So I try
I can't find the words to say goodbye
I know I have to go
There's no other way
But goodbye is not what I
Can bring myself to say
I can tell her "see you later"
But then I might be wrong
This voice inside is driving me
To find where I belong
I know I must leave her now
Everytime I try
I can't find the words to say goodbye
Don't know why
I can't find the words to say goodbyeI've been crazy, I've been blinded
I've been walking down the wrong path of life
I've been broke down, I've been mistreated
To ever think that our love had a chance to survive
I know I haven't held you as much
As much as I should
I know I haven't given you everything
Everything that I could
If I promise tonight, to change my life
Would you come back, or have I waited to long
If I made things right, if I started tonight
Would you come back to me
Or have I waited too long
I have been faithful, I have never strayed
And I know that there are times I don't see things your way
But I'm still here, and I will never leave
And if this whole thing doesn't work out
It won't be because of me
If I promise toonight, to change my life
Would you come back, or have I waited too long
If I made things right, if I started tonight
Would you ocme back to me
Or have I waited too long
I remember a wise old man telling me
You better hold on to what you've got
It'll slip right though your fingers
And you don't know what you've got until its gone
Until it is gone
If I promise tonight, to change my life
Would you come back, or have I waited to long
If I made things right, if I started tonight
Would you come back to me
Or have I waited too long
Too long
Have I waited too long
Too long, too long, too long
My baby. . ..Suppose I called you up tonight and told you that I loved you
And suppose I said "I wanna come back home".
And suppose I cried and said "I think I finally learned my lesson"
And I'm tired a-spendin' all my time alone.
If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killin' me to be so far away.
Would you tell me that you loved me too and would we cry together?
Or would you simply laugh at me and say
"I told you so, oh I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again".
If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand?
Would we get that old time feelin', would we laugh and talk for hours
The way we did when our love first began?
Would you tell me that you'd missed me too and that you've been so lonely
And you waited for the day that I return.
And we'd live in love forever and that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned?
Would you say
"I told you so, oh I told you so
I told you some day you come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again".
"Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again".He was kinda like Superman
Show up, save the day, disappear and then
We wouldn't hear from him 'til Christmas
He was a whole lotta fun
Til he got one drink too drunk
A Fight would start he'd be breaking hearts and dishes
I used to say that I'd be damned
Before I'd ever fall in love with a man
Like the one Mama wasted her youth on
I wait up all night alone I feel like I'm six years old again
You're just like him
Daddy had the bluest eyes
Kept my Mama hypnotized
Now I finally realize the reason
They say love's like coming home
And I came from a broken one
So why am I surprised you're always leaving
I used to say that I'd be damned before I'd ever fall in love with a man
Like the one Mama wasted her youth on
And I wait up all night alone I feel like I'm six years old again
You're just like himSo I feel so blue sometimes I want to die and so I've got a broken heart so what
They say that time will heal all wounds in mice and men
And I know that someday I'll forget and love again
But just between you and me I've got my doubts about it
Just between you and me you're too much to forget
So I've lost the only one I've ever loved and so I've never felt so low so what
I'll just tell myself each time I want to cry
That someday time will dry the teardrops from my eyes
Just between you and me I'm not so sure about it
Just between you and me you're too much to forget
You're too much to forgetDon't be angry with me darling if I fail to understand
All your little whims and wishes all the time
Just remember that I'm dumb I guess like any foolish man
And my head stays sorta foggy cause you're mine
Well I recall the first time that I flirted with you dear
When I jokingly said come and be my bride
Now that time has turned the pages it's the sweetest joke on earth
That I have you dear forever by my side
[ steel ]
Maybe someday you're gonna hurt me I've been hurt in love before
Only God can know and time alone will tell
But in the mean time I'll keep loving you with all my heart and soul
And pray God to let it last if it's his will
So don't be angry with me darling if I fail to understand
All your little whims and wishes all the time
Just remember that I'm dumb I guess like any foolish man
And my head stays sorta foggy cause you're mine(L. Leatherman)
She's my curly headed baby
She's from sunny Tennessee
She's my curly headed baby
She's more than all the world to me
I have loved her since I met her (yes sir)
More than any tongue can tell
If she ever prove falls hearted
It would be so hard to say farewell
Yodeleyie-ie-ie-ie
(break)
Now let me tell you 'bout some women (hmmhmm)
I can tell you how they'll do
They gonna be cryin' on your shoulder
And be flirting with another too
She's my curly headed baby
She's from sunny Tennessee
She's my curly headed baby
She's more than all the world to me
Yodeleyie-ie-ie-ie
(break)
When I look into her blue eyes
There's more than words can ever say
I could never love some other
No one else can make me feel this way
She's my curly headed baby
She's from sunny Tennessee
She's my curly headed baby
She's more than all the world to me
Yodeleyie-ie-ie-ieThe streets are cracked
And there's glass everywhere
And a baby stares out
With motherless eyes
Under long gone beauty
On fields of war
Trapped in lament
To the poet's core
Oh where oh where will I be
Oh where oh when that trumpets sounds
Met an Indian boy in Ottawa
He laid me down on a bed of straw
Said don't waste your breath
Don't waste your heart
Don't	blister your heels
Running in the dark
Oh where oh where will I be
Oh where oh when that trumpets sounds
Yeah I like the heat
Of your body laying under me
May your wild lip get you where your going
With your inventions your intentions, your laughter
Your forever yearning
Oh where oh where will I be
Oh where oh when that trumpets sounds
I walked to the river
And I walked to the rim
I walked through the teeth of the reaper's grin
I walked to you rolled up in wire
To the other side of desire
Oh where oh where will I be
Oh where oh when that trumpets sounds
Oh where oh where oh where when that trumpet sounds
Oh where oh where oh when that trumpet sounds
Well the heart opens wide like it's never seen love
And addiction stays on tight like a glove
Oh where oh where will I beTen feet away from the judgment day
Ten feet away from the runway
Tell your girlfriend there's a party in town
And she can come and she can stay
I've been a hotel room and a day on the road
I've been a stone for ev'ry hole in the road
Hey O', there's a stage for ev'ry star in the show
And there's a star for ev'ry stage
Ten feet away from the stage she can stand
Hey O', do you know if she'll think that it's grand
Ten feet away she has the stage in her hands
Hey O', does she know that she's a star in the show
Hey O'
(Hey O')
Hey O'
(Hey O')
Hey O'
There was a girl in California they say
She sold her ticket to ride and then she gave it away
She only wanted someone coming her way (Oooh)
Never the one (Never the one) is coming to stay
Ten feet away from the stage she can stand
Hey O', do you know if she'll think that it's grand
Ten feet away she has the stage in her hands
Hey O', does she know that she's a star in the show
Hey O'
(Hey O')
Hey O'
(Hey O')
Hey O'
(repeat)While resting the other evening by the side of the road
I saw an old farmer in the field that he just hold
His face was all brown and wrinkled by the sun and the wind
And he was talking to the Lord just like he'd be talking to a friend
Well, he said with his voice calm and quiet
Them corn tassels need sucking, I got no strength to tie it
Had no rain in so long that the fields are mighty dusty
And it's been so unbearable hot that the kids were even gettin' fussy
Now that grass down and the pasture it should be knee high if we
Could just have a little shower Lord it might keep the calf from going dry
Oh, but listen to me talking, you'd think I wasn't grateful, why if you
Didn't know me so well Lord you'd think I was down right hateful
You'd think I forgot about that new calf that you sent
And the money in the mail that took care of the rent
Mama's cough's better and Johnny's home from the navy
And that good Sunday dinner of hot chicken and dumplings and gravy
And that new preacher you sent us, Lord he's sure a fine young man
Why he's just convertin' them sinners to beat the man
Well, I guess, I'll mosey on home now, Lord, I won't take no more your time
I guess, there's plenty folks here about waitin' to ring your line
Evening to you, Lord, and watch us over tonight
Don't you worry about us now, Lord, 'cause everything is gonna be all rightIt's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
Try as I may, I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all
All day long I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
Old Mr. Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at allI'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white ChristmasSome day some old familiar rain will come along and know my name
And then my shelter will be gone and I'll have to move along
But till I do I'll stay awhile and track the hidden country of your smile
Some day the man I used to be will come along and call on me
And then because I'm just a man you'll find my feet are made of sand
But till that time I'll tell you lies and chart the hidden boundrys of your eyes
Some day the world I used to know will come along and lead me go
Then I'll be leaving you behind for love is just a state of mind
But till that day I'll be your man and love away your troubles if I canSweet miss behavin'
Honey now is it true
You got the whole town talkin'
About the things you do
They say you're trouble
But trouble never looked so good
Are you miss behavin'
Or a little miss understood
You like to dance
You like to flirt
Shake and shimmy
In your mini skirt
You're leading me on
To an early grave
Honey won't you please behave
Sweet miss behavin'
Honey now it ain't right
If you're miss behavin'
With anyone but me tonight
Well you caused the train
To jump the track
You just kept goin'
And you never looked back
You show no mercy
Got no shame
Honey won't you please behave
Sweet miss behavin'
Honey now it ain't right
If you're miss behavin'
With anyone but me tonight
Sweet miss behavin'
Honey let's do it right
We'll go miss behavin'
Together tonight
Let's go miss behavin' tonightRed light traffic standing still
Keeping me from you
Tough days always in this town but this one will soon be through
Cause right around the bend on the porch there by the drive
There's an angel out there waiting to bring me back to life
She always saves me from all of my crazy
Like a heads up penny lying on the ground she'll be shining
Yeah with every little laugh and look she gets me believing
There ain't a worry in my world that won't stop fading
When she's next to me
So I need to be on my way
Red to green and finally I'm moving again
Faster than this backbone should be traveling
Up ahead I see her hand waiving in the air
Faded cut back denim and tangled auburn hair
She opens up the door
All I want and more
Like a heads up penny lying on the ground she'll be shining
Yeah with every little laugh and look she gets me believing
There ain't a worry in my world that won't stop fading
When she's next to me
Where I need to be on my way
She can't sit still for the thrill of the night that's coming on
It's only a matter of time until my troubles are gone
Like a heads up penny lying on the ground she'll be shining
Yeah with every little laugh and look she gets me believing
There ain't a worry in my world that won't stop fading
When she's next to me
Oh can't you see I'm on my way
I'm on my wayYou don't want no more heartaches
And I don't want no teardrops
What else is love to talk about
Cause I ain't yours you ain't mine
The song don't fit and the words don't rhyme
Old memories keep standing in the way
You lost her I lost him
Two old hearts just won't love again
We don't need no memories hanging round
Since she's gone it don't seem right
Better off left alone at night
I ain't faking feelings far away
The days just come and disappear
You can't talk when I don't hear
It don't make no difference anyway
I lost her you lost him
Two old hearts just won't love again
I don't need no memories hanging roundWell, you know I'm not much good at writin' letters
So I gave up and decided that I'd call
No, there's really not much news to tell you
Things back here, they never change at all
It's snowed today, it's cold here for November
But I hear the weather's warm out there.
Oh, and if you see Burt Reynolds
Would you shake his hand for me?
And tell old Burt, I've seen all his movies
Well, I hope you make the big time
I hope your dreams come true
But if Hollywood don't need you
Honey, I still do.
Last night I drove the truck to Amarillo
Some friends and I had a laugh or two
But lately we don't cut up like we used to
'Cause all that I can think about is you
I know this is what you've always wanted
But I know now that all I want is you.
Oh, and if you see Burt Reynolds
Would you shake his hand for me?
And tell old Burt, I've seen all his movies
Well, I hope you make the big time
I hope your dreams come true
But if Hollywood don't need you
Honey, I still do.We're looking for The King
The new Messiah
We're following the star
Shining brighter
Old man won't you help us if you can
He shook his head
But he pointed his hand
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem
I see you've traveled far
Bearing treasures
You say these gifts are for
The new Kings pleasures
Well I've heard
That a King might come
But up 'til now there hasn't been one
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in BethlehemWondering wondering who's kissing you
Wondering just wondering if you're wondering too
Every hour through the day since you went away
I've been wondering if you are still wondering too
I pray every night to the good Lord above please send back the girl that I really love
Every hour through the day since you went away
I've been wondering if you are still wondering too
I'm so blue just thinking of you it seems as though the sun will never shine
I hope and pray you'll come and say that you will forever be mine
Wondering wonderingThey got the Coliseum rockin' and they're making quite a din
Singin' "here we go Oilers, here we go" again
There ain't no louder building than the house of ninety-nine
Got the echoes of the dynasty a burnin' in their minds
You better cheer 'em on, they're the roughest necks around.
'Cause it's hockey night in Edmonton, the Oil's back in town, yeah!
Skatin' quick and passin' pretty, fastest ice around the league
The goalie stacks 'em up and makes a save you can't believe
Elbows in the corners and she's getting kinda rough
But I know we've got some boys that ain't afraid to drop the gloves
You better cheer 'em on, they're the roughest necks around
'Cause it's hockey night in Edmonton, the Oil's back in town, yeah!
All they got is broken noses, missin' teeth and blackened eyes
Beards and blood and guts and stitches keepin' playoff hopes alive
And the spirit of the boys from the Eighties in their eyes
Come on and say it with me, say it "Five cups, five!"
You better cheer 'em on, 'cause they're better than the rest
They got the blue and orange colours of the Oilers on their chests, yeah!
Well, I got me a couple tickets, take my baby to the game
'Cause the road trip's over, winnin' every game away
Don't really need my radio, but bring it anyway
Catch the skipper, Roddy Phillips, call the play-by-play
You better cheer 'em on, they're the roughest necks around
'Cause it's hockey night in Edmonton, the Oil's back in town.You file me with the libertines
I fold in line
My monthly dole of magazines
Beaming bistro shine
In my ladle is your plum
And my daily staple of your cutesy crumbs
Of your cutesy falling crumbs
I saw you at the snazzy din-din
You made me sad that I watched
I must say you truly packed 'em in
Nearly dearly debauched
In my ladle is your plum
And my daily staple of your cutesy crumbs
Of your cutesy falling crumbs
In my ladle is your plum
And my daily staple of your cutesy crumbs
Of your cutesy falling crumbsYou stole his love and left behind dear a broken heart a worried mind
Your new found love will turn to hate dear and you'll be left alone to pine
Stolen love can't last forever stealing leads to a life of sin
You stole his love from another your stolen love I know someday will end
You'll walk in shadows branded forever you and you alone will bear the shame
Stolen love can't last forever with stolen love you play a losing game
Stolen love can't last foreverThe cool fall breeze is blowin' and the leaves are turnin' gold
And the smell of wood smoke takes me back to days of long ago
I think about my childhood pumpkin pie and Halloween
And the magic in a young boy's hopes and dreams.
Time time goes on endlessly just like a river runnin' surely to the sea
Time time you've left your mark on me but time we've had a good time haven't we
But the years went by too quickly and the leaves fall from the trees
And the winds a little colder now than what it used to be
And I feel kind of saddened that the summer now is gone
And a little scared of what now lies beyond
Time time goes on endlessly
I pull in off the highway to another rodeo
To another crowd of people think it's just a wild west show
I'll ride my bronc and drive away and head on down the road
It's a hell of a way to make a buck but it's the only life I've known
Time time goes on endlesslyTudo errado
Eu joguei
Os meus sonhos pro alto
No momento em que te deixei
Quatro anos de paixÃ£o
SÃ³ serviram pra mostrar
Que nÃ£o se brinca com o coraÃ§Ã£o
E o desespero bate forte...
Te envio nossas fotos das fÃ©rias em Salvador
Te mando mil mensagens pra falar do meu amor
NÃ£o durmo mais na cama, pois seu cheiro ali estÃ¡
A solidÃ£o nÃ£o quer mais me deixar
Procuro em outros olhos encontrar o brilho seu
No som do carro ainda toca o CD que me deu
Simples detalhes de uma vida Ã  dois
O amor ficou sÃ³ que vocÃª se foi
VocÃª se foi ...
Tudo errado
Jogo aberto
SÃ³ menti pra adiar o final que jÃ¡ era certo
Aventura, sem sentido.
SÃ³ me fez perder vocÃª
Minhas lÃ¡grimas estÃ£o caindo
E o desespero bate forte
Te envio nossas fotos das fÃ©rias em Salvador
Te mando mil mensagens pra falar do meu amor
NÃ£o durmo mais na cama pois seu cheiro ali estÃ¡
A solidÃ£o nÃ£o quer mais me deixar
Procuro em outros olhos encontrar o brilho seu
No som do carro ainda toca o CD que me deu
Simples detalhes de uma vida a dois
O amor ficou sÃ³ que vocÃª se foi
VocÃª se foi ...

A gente pode voltar, deve haver algum jeitoSnow flakes falling on the ground mistletoe hangs all around
Last minute shoppers everywhere Christmas spirit fills the air
Happy little girls and boys windows filled with Christmas toys
It's that special time of youth oh Christmas time is near
Kiddys being extra nice take their moms and dads at advice because
If they're good the way they should they'll get an extra gift from Santa Claus
Sleigh bells ringing here and there Christmas carols everywhere
It's that special time of youth oh Christmas time is near
Kiddys being extra nice
Oh Christmas time is nearO Holy Night! The stars are brightly shining,
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!(Don Rich)
Hello California, California here I come
Well, here I am on my way back home
With my discharge in my hand
It sure is good have my two feet
Back on solid land
I didn't see a woman for eighteen days
When I crawled aboard that ship
And seein' all the girls in mini skirts
Is givin' my heart a lift
Hello California, you sure are place to see
Goodbye Arizona, you're just a little too hot for me
Well, New York City and Albuquerque
Sure was a lotta fun
Hello California, California here I come
--- Instrumental ---
Well, when I left home about a year ago
I sure wasn't much of a man
And there's still a lotta things in this old world
That I don't understand
But there's one thing that I'm certain of
I should have figured it out before
Oh, when I get back to California
I ain't never gonna leave no more
Hello California, you sure are place to see
Goodbye Arizona, you're just a little too hot for me
Well, New York City and Albuquerque
Sure was a lotta fun
Hello California, California here I come
Hello California, California here I come...Change comes in like a rising tide
Ain't no reason, ain't no signs
It's just the way the tilt a whirl turns
It's just the way the barricades burn
Take one step up take a step on a crack
Daddy said it ain't no good to run with the pack
So I'm just gonna keep stumblin' on down this road
Where it goes I ain't supposed to know
It ain't ever gonna be like it used to be
Ain't ever gonna be like it used to be.
If I wait all my life I'll just wait and see
It ain't ever gonna be like it used to be
Love shows up and love goes south
Love knows it ain't all got no doubts
I can't hang on only losers weep
Somebody ain't nobody anybody can keep
It ain't ever gonna be like it used to be
Don't wanna say goodbye but it'll set me free
If I wait all my life I'll just wait and see
It ain't ever gonna be like it used to be
You might say you will but you know you won't
You might think you do but you know you don't
Once you give it up there ain't no getting it back
It don't matter if you're Cyrano de Bergerac
I ain't looking back I'm just looking up
I ain't no fool but I'll never know much
Mama told me, baby, just grab it and growl
Gotta take your shot or it'll take you down
It ain't ever gonna be like it used to be
Don't want to say goodbye but it'll set me free
If I wait all my life I'll just wait and see
It ain't ever gonna be like it used to beDarling, there is something I must tell you, you must know
But it's so hard to say the words I feel
This fancy that I'm on has been going on too long
It's time we stopped pretending things are real
'Cause I've been living deep in sin
I've been living blind
And I don't know just what's right or wrong
To take a chance on losing you was such a silly thing to do
The chance I might wake up and find you gone
Blue, so blue, my love is burning blue
Any brighter flame would be a lie
Blue, so blue, my love still burns for you
But I know that I'll only make you cry
A thief can only steal from you
He cannot break your heart
He'll never touch the precious things inside
So one like you should surely be miles and miles away from me
Then you'd never care how much I've liedSo long we've been married
Life's burdens we carried
Though they kept us humble and made our love true
The plans that we make up
Someone seems to break up
Oh, darlin', what else can we do?
[Chorus]
We may have to leave here
To find peace of mind, dear
Some place where we can live a life all our own
For I know you love me, and happy we could be
If some folks would leave us alone
While I go out walkin'
There's of loose talkin'
They say we're unhappy and we'll break apart
But, darlin', it's not true
Because I still love you
And I do with all my heart
[Chorus]
They say that you're leavin'
That you are deceiving
But you tell me they say the same about me
But we'll show them they're wrong
That loose talk will do harm
And hope that the truth they will see
[Chorus]One night when the moon was bright on the moonlit glade
That is where I found my little Cherokee maiden
The memory of that night of love is lingering here
And I know I never will forget
My little Cherokee maiden, I love her so
Even though we're far apart
I know I'll never be trading my love for her
For anybody else's heart
Someday I'll make a trip back to that Cherokee strip
And I'll carry her away with me
And straight as an arrow flies, we'll ride to Paradise
My sweet little chickadee, my little Cherokee maiden and me
My little Cherokee maiden, I love her so
Even though we're far apart
I know I'll never be trading my love for her
For anybody else's heartI just came in here tonight to get somebody off my mind
I just want to be alone my heartache and my wine
So if it's all the same to you my friend just be on your way
I can see you've got problems but I've had my share today
I'd be glad to help you out just show me which way you came in
I've got troubles of my own in fact my world just fell in
Your sad tellin' has touched but go tell it to a friend
I'd be glad to help you out just show me which way you came in
[ steel ]
Now don't think that I'm so unconcerned about your happiness
You need someone to talk to it help one to confess
But your problems are so simple when you lay them next to mine
So just mosey on now Mister you're just taking off my time
I'd be glad to help you out...
I'd be so glad to help you out just show me which way you came inYou left me, my darling to travel alone
My heart is so lonely and blue
When friends ask about you why you're not around
How will I explain about you?
How will I explain about you?
They know I've been faithful and true
So when they start asking why you're not around
How will I explain about you?
They saw us together for such a long time
They knew that I loved you so true
But now that you've gone and I'm left all alone
How will I explain about you?
How will I explain about you?
I can't let them know that we're through
They wouldn't believe it could ever be true
How will I explain about you?
If ever you were lonely and wish to return
Remember I'm waiting for you
But if I must travel that pathway alone
How will I explain about you?
How will I explain about you?
I'm leaving it all up to you
And if you insist that our pathway must part
How will I explain about you?
How will I explain about you?
I'm leaving it all up to you
And if you insist that our pathway must part
How will I explain about you?I ain't nothin' but a simple man
They call me a redneck I reckon that I am
But there's things going on
That make me mad down to the core.
I have to work like a dog to make ends meet
There's crooked politicians and crime in the street
And I'm madder'n hell and I ain't gonna take it no more.
We tell our kids to just say no
Then some panty waist judge lets a drug dealer go
Slaps him on the wrist and then he turns him back out on the town.
Now if I had my way with people sellin' dope
I'd take a big tall tree and a short piece of rope
I'd hang 'em up high and let 'em swing 'til the sun goes down
Well, you know what's wrong with the world today
People done gone and put their Bible's away
They're living by the law of the jungle not the law of the land
The good book says it so I know it's the truth
An eye for and eye and a tooth for a tooth
You better watch where you go and remember where you been
That's the way I see it I'm a Simple Man.
Now I'm the kinda man that'd not harm a mouse
But if I catch somebody breakin in my house
I've got twelve gauge shotgun waiting on the other side
So don't go pushing me against my will
I don't want to have to fight you but I dern sure will
So if you don't want trouble then you'd better just pass me on by
As far as I'm concerned there ain't no excuse
For the raping and the killing and the child abuse
And I've got a way to put an end to all that mess
Just take them rascals out in the swamp
Put 'em on their knees and tie 'em to a stump
Let the rattlers and the bugs and the alligators do the rest
You know what's wrong with the world today
People done gone and put their Bible's away
They're living by the law of the jungle not the law of the land
The Good Book says it so I know it's the truth
An eye for and eye and a tooth for a tooth
You better watch where you go and remember where you been
That's the way I see it I'm a simple manVerse 1:
Just across the mountains in a valley down below
Lived a girl I mer back years ago
Her eyes shined like diamonds her hair was of gold
But that was before she left me all alone
Chorus:
How she lives in my memory today
Oh how I miss her warm and touching ways
And someday I hope she'll want to go
Back to the mountains and the valley down below
Verse 2:
One day she came to me and said I have to go
My family is moving I thought you'd want to know
But I'll never forget you and your smiling face
And the way that you held me with your warming graceSing a song sweet music man 'cause I won't be there
To hold your hand like I used to, I'm through with you
You're a heck of a singer and powerful man but you surround yourself
With people who demand so little of you
You touched my soul with your beautiful song
You even had me singin' along right with you, you said
"I need you", then you changed the words and added harmony
Then you sang the song you had written for me to someone new
Oh, but nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Oh, and nobody else can make me sing along
Nobody else can make me feel things are right
When I know they're wrong, nobody sings a love song quite like you
Sing your song sweet music man, travel the world
With a six piece band that does for you what you tell 'em to
And you try to stay young but the songs are sung
To so many people who've all begun came back on you
Sing your song sad music man, makin' your living
Doing one night stands, they're through with you
They don't need you, you're still a heck of a singer but a broken man
But you'll keep on lookin' for one last fan to sing to
Oh, and nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Oh, and nobody else can make me sing along and nobody else
Can make me feel things are right when they're wrong with a song
Nobody sings a love song quite like you
Sing your song sweet music man, I believe in youOh, who will plough the fields all day
And who will thresh the corn
Who will tend the sheep now
And see them neatly shorn
The stack that's in the haggard
Unthreshed it may remain
Now that Johnnys gone a-threshing
All in the wars of Spain
The girls down in the Bang
In sorrow may retire
And the piper with his bellows
May go home and blow the fire
Now Johnny, lovely Johnny
Is sailing o'er the main
Along with other patriots
To fight the king of Spain
The boys will surely miss him
When Moneymore comes around
And theyll weep that their bold captain
Is nowhere to be found
And the peelers may stand idle
All against their will and grain
Since the gallant boy who gave them work
Now peels the king of Spain
At wakes and hurling matches
Your like we'll never see
'Till you come back to us again
Mo storeen g mo chroi
And won't you thresh the buckeens
That show us much disdain
Because our eyes are not so bright
As those youll see in SpainThere ain't much to do here in this town
When the work is done and the sun goes down
There's a place that we all go
Where it's two for one just to watch the show
Yeah, me and the boys hangin' around
Hands in our pockets, gettin' lost in the crowd
Watchin' pretty girls drinkin' tall boys
Swingin' their hips to a country song
Silver cans up in the air
They're singin' along, singing' along
Ain't nothin' like gettin' right
Chasing a buzz with a cold Bud Light
Watchin' pretty girls drinkin' tall boys
Pretty girls drinkin' tall boys
Yeah
Yeah you oughta see them in summer time
They can't wait to show off those tan lines
Out at a cove that we all know
Where it's string bikinis and tied up boats
Out in the sun all gettin' baked
Me and the boys kickin' back in our shades
Watchin' pretty girls drinkin' tall boys
Swingin' their hips to a country song
Silver cans up in the air
They're singing' along, singin' along
Ain't nothin' like gettin' right
Chasing a buzz with a cold Bud Light
Watchin' pretty girls drinkin' tall boys
Pretty girls drinkin' tall boys
Yeah
Call me lazy, drunk, or crazy
But I ain't ever gonna move
Nah, cause you can't beat this view
Pretty girls drinkin' tall boys
Pretty girls drinkin' tall boys
Pretty girls drinkin' tall boys
Ya got my mind thinkin'
'Bout pretty girls drinkin'
Pretty girls drinkin' tall boys
Swingin' their hips to a country song
Silver cans up in the air
They're singin' along, singin' along
Ain't nothin' like gettin' right
Chasing a buzz with a cold Bud Light
Watchin' pretty girls drinkin' tall boys
Pretty girls drinkin' tall boys
Pretty girls drinkin' tall boys
Pretty girls drinkin' tall boys
Pretty girls drinkin', pretty girls drinkin'
Pretty girls drinkin' tall boys
Got my mind thinkin'
'Bout pretty girls drinkin'
Swingin' their hips to a country song(Dolly Parton)
He wanted more from like
Than four kids and a wife
And a job in the dark Kentucky mines
A twenty-acre farm
With a shacky house and barn
That's all he had
And all he left behind
At gambling he was lucky
So he left Kentucky
Left behind his woman and his kids
Into the gay casino
In Nevada's town of Reno
Kentucky gambler planned to get rich quick
Kentucky gambler, who's gonna love your woman in Kentucky
Who's gonna be the one to give her what she needs
Kentucky gambler, who's gonna raise your children in Kentucky
Who's gonna keep them fed and keep shoes on their feet
At the gamblers' paradise
Lady luck was on his side
Kentucky gambler played his cards just right
He won at everything he played
Kentucky gambler had it made
And he should have quit and gone on home that night
But when you love the greenback dollar
Sorrow's always bound to follow
Reno dreams fade into neon amber
And lady luck, she'll leave you on
She'll saty awhile, and then she's gone
You'd better go on home Kentucky gambler
But a gambler never seems to stop
Til he loses all he's got
And so, Kentucky gambler, he played on
He played til he lost all he won
He was right back where he started from
Then he started wanting to go home
Kentucky gambler, there ain't nobody waiting in Kentucky
When you walked out, somebody else walked in
Kentucky gambler, looks like you ain't really very lucky
Seems to me a gambler looses much more than he wins
So you think about it
Kentucky gamblerGot a guitar
Got a guitar on my back
And I'm standin' on this lonesome railroad track
Train's a-comin'
It'll be here 'fore too long
But I don't think I can stop it with a song
Girl, that's the kind of way I'm feelin'
Tryin' to stop your leavin'
Got a pebble
Got a pebble in my hand
And I toss it out into the middle of the Rio Grande
But the river keeps runnin'
Don't even know that I'm around
I could throw a million more and not slow it down
Girl, that's kind of the way I'm feelin'
Tryin' to stop your leavin'
There's nothin' that I wouldn't try
If I thought it would change your mind
But you don't love me
No, you don't love me anymore
And I know as soon as you walk out that door
Train's a comin', river's runnin'
Train's a comin', river's runnin'
Pain's a comin', tears are runnin'
Yeah, that's kind of the way I'm feelin'
Knowin' I couldn't stop your leavin'My Boy Burns
(Michael Timmins)
My Boy Burns
Like a 5 alarm fire
My Boy Burns
Like a 5 alarm fire
Tears and ash in his wake
Tears and ash in his wake
My Boy Burns
Like the tail of a comet
My Boy Burns
Like the tail of a comet
And we are tossed in his wake
And we are tossed in his wake
My Boy Burns
with the fire of a prophet
My Boy Burns
With the fire of a prophet
Sun and Moon in his hands
Sun and Moon in his hands
We are drawn in his wake
We Are drawn in his wakeYou walked away from me and this child
I dried her tears last night
Gently I rocked her while I quietly cooed
With a heart that won't stop loving you
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you
I'm feeling helpless, I do
Why did you leave, I'm so confused
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you
Deep in the night our baby screamed
She sought for mommy to come
I told her I hoped that daddy will do
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you
I'm feeling helpless, I do
Why did you leave, I'm so confused
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you
Now here you stand pleading with me
You ask if I can forgive
My mind is shouting not to try to
But my heart won't stop loving you
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you
I'm feeling helpless, I do
Why did you leave, I'm so confused
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you
What will it change if I take you back
How can I know you'll try
I can't let go of the good times we had
Tell me, have your feelings died
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you
I'm feeling helpless, I do
Why did you leave, I'm so confused
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you
Why did you leave, I'm so confused
I got a heart that won't stop loving youI pack up my saddle
Throw it in that two-horse trailer
Back up my truck, hook 'em up
And drive away
Won't be the first time
But this time's the last time
She meant it when she said
That's all I've got to say
Never had been thrown like this before
I ain't her cowboy anymore
Never saw it comin'
But I knew where it was goin'
When she asked how long this time
Before I hit the road
She didn't come right out and say it
But I sure got the message
When I reached out to hold her
That shoulder sure was cold
Figured I'd just let goodbye run its course
I ain't her cowboy anymore
[Chorus]
These white lines are a blur
Like the last few nights I spent with her
I don't know where I went wrong
Or if I did
Like the good ol' boy I am
I told her that I understand
But Lord knows that I won't long as I live
Seems lately every time it rains it pours
I ain't her cowboy anymore
We met in Denver
Settled down in Dallas
The best days of my life
Were the ones I spent with her
You'd think that all that lovin' ought to count for something
Guess I wore out my welcome
Like the rowels of these old spurs
That Casper sunset's what I'm shootin' for
'Cause I ain't her cowboy anymore
[Chorus]
Her cowboy anymore
I ain't her cowboy anymoreI was the class clown,
I kept them laughing out loud.
Known all over town for turning frowns upside down.
I guess it's just a gift that God blessed me with,
And I'm thankful everyday that he made me this way.
I may not always feel like putting on a show,
But when I hear these words I Just can't say no.
Chorus
Make me laugh Funnyman,
No one can do it like you can.
I sure would like to smile,
Forget my troubles for awhile.
With a joke you know how to make the sun shine though the clouds.
If it's no to much to ask,
Make me laugh Funnyman.
Now I've made it my life to play the fool every night.
I must have been a million miles seen at least that many smiles.
And it's a dream come true doing what I love to do.
And if it ended tonight I've had the time of my life.
Here's to all the friends and fans I've made along the way,
I know I wouldn't be here if I hadn't heard you say...
-repeat chorus-
Sometimes I hate to leave the stage.
Cause then the laughter fades away.
And then the crowd goes home,
And leaves me all alone.
And I look in the mirror and one more time I say...
-repeat chorus-I was a fool, broke every rule, blue darlin'
Saw the tears take the place of your sweet smile
I played it smart, I broke your heart, blue darlin'
And lost the only love in life worthwhile
So please, please forgive me
I'm sorry for the wrong that I've done
My heart would cry if ever I should lose you
Blue darlin', you're the only, only one
Im askin you what can I do, blue darlin
To let you know I love you so and did you know
Id walk through fire, you I desire, blue darlin
My bleeding heart is torn apart, I feel so low
So please, please forgive me
I'm sorry for the wrong that I've done
My heart would cry if ever I should lose you
Blue darlin', you're the only, only one
So please, please forgive me
I'm sorry for the wrong that I've done
My heart would cry if ever I should lose you
Blue darlin', you're the only, only one
Blue darlin, youre the only, only oneEvery time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time
Thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What I might say
There's a message
In the wild
And I'm sending you
This signal tonight
You don't know
How desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world
I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard
To understand
And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What my friends say
And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What my friends say
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I keep lying to myself
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What my friends say
Ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I keep lying to myself
Ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
Ain't missing you
Oh no
No matter what my friends might say
I ain't missing youThe day we met
I'll never forget
Was the luckiest of my life
She took me so far
And I broke her heart
Now I'm sittin` here
With the simple truth
That tears me apart
Chorus:
All I had goin` is gone
The best I'll ever do
Is over and done
It serves me right
'Cause I did her wrong
Now all I had goin` is gone
Sometimes a man
Just don't understand
He possesses everything life can bring
He thinks there's more
So he has to explore
Leavin` her alone
Time after time
Til she wlaked out my door
Now it serves me right
She left me alone
Now all I had goin` is goneI was hitch hiking walking neath the beating sun
No luck till that purple bus of love pulled up
They said Hey brah, looks like you could use a ride
Yeah we took us a vote and we think you should drive
Because we are feeling kind of loaded
Not sure just where this trip is going
But probly somewhere on the water torch in the sand
We just might never ever come back from this high upside down
So we ate Doritos and on we drove
The only hippy not tokin was a girl named Flo
A groovy little smile she really lit me up
She said I'm lookin for truth but I'd be happy with love
And we were feeling kind of loaded
Not sure just where that trip was going
But probly somewhere on the water torch in the sand
We just might never ever come back from this high upside down
BRIDGE
Up, up, up like two balloons
It's so fun hangin with you
I just wanna stay right here- up in the clouds
This high upside down
SOLO
And we were feeling kind of loaded
Not sure just where that trip was going
But probly somewhere on the water torch in the sand
We just might never ever come back from this high upside down
We found a carnival out on a seaside pier
We shared a chilli dog with cheese and an ice cold beer
The smoke was wearin off we were losing the rush
Then she kissed me on the Ferris wheel and we went back up...
BRIDGE
Up, up, up like two balloons
It's so fun hangin with you
I just wanna stay right here- up in the clouds
Girl you've got me so high upside downAlong the wild Texas border, was no law and order
When Reno brought me to this land
He was after the wild ones, the mustangs, the shy ones
And hoping that I'd understand
But there's too many long nights, a wife should have some rights
It seems that it's so plain to see
Reno my husband, oh, he loves the wild ones
Much more than he'll ever love me
He's riding somewhere out there with his raven black hair
And a heart that is loving and wild
He's too much afire with ambitious desire
To be tied to a wife and a child
The horses are cunning, they soon will be running
And Reno will always be gone
These things I'm knowing, the Rio is flowing
And Reno, I'm goin' back home
'Cross the Mexican border, my house all in order
I wait for a knock on my door
Little Juan, the small one, the son of the tall one
So peacefully plays on the floor
But what are these yearnings that always keep burning?
I feel so deeply inside
My love for Reno, my flashing young gringo
Has suddenly vanquished my pride
He's riding somewhere out there with his raven black hair
And a heart that is loving and wild
He's so much afire and with too much desire
To be alone without a wife and a child
The horses are cunning, they soon will be running
And Reno will quickly be gone
There's no more waiting, no more hesitating
Oh, Reno, I'm coming back home
Wait Reno, I'm coming back homeAs I sit here tonight the jukebox playin'
The tune about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words you are sayin'
It brings memories when I was a trusting wife
It wasn't God who made Honky Tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame
It wasn't God who made Honky Tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrongIf you're not in my arms then you're too far away
And when you're far away I'd get the blues
You're the first thing I think of at the dawn of day
And the last thing that I'll ever want to lose
Oh I start to weak all over when you're out of my sight
And I know 'till your return I won't feel better
So keep on loving me the way you do
Just as long as you want me to
And we'll always be together
At times I know my feet don't even touch the ground
And it's because of you I feel this way
Hmm there's not a thing that I can think of that can keep me down
Just as long as I can see you every day
I've heard 'em say that true nearly always fades
Ah but we know something they don't we know better
So keep on loving me the way you do
Just as long as you want me to
And we'll always be togetherI see Christian pilgrim
Soul redeemed from sin
Called out of darkness
A new life to begin
Were you ever in the valley
Where the way is dark and dim
Did you ever drink the cup
Of lonliness with him?
Did you ever have them laugh at you
And say it was a fake
The stand that you so boldly
For the Lord did take
Did they ever mock at you
And laugh in ways quit grim
Did you ever drink the cup
Of lonliness with him?
--- Instrumental ---
Did you ever try to preach
Then hold fast and pray
And even when you did it
There did not seem a way
And you lost all courage
Then lost all your vim
Did you ever drink the cup
Of lonliness with him?
Aw, my friend 'tis bitter sweet
While here on earthly sod
To follow in the footsteps
That our dear Savior trod
To suffer with the Savior
And when the way is dark and dim
To drink of the bitter the cup
Of loneliness with HimIt was running through my mind, I was running out of time
And it was time to let you go
No more right or wrong, no more crying all night long
Even though it's lonely here alone
When the phone rings I almost wish that it was you
There's nothing left to say and nothing we can do
I can stand on my own two feet
And I know that this is best for you and me
Believe me, it's not easy, I can feel the pain
It hurts so much to leave, but not enough to stay
You've convinced me before to come back for more
Well this time I'm not turning around
I'm sure one more try is bound to end in goodbye
And I've come too far to turn back now
I know the hardest part is over and I take a breath
Now we can look forward to better days ahead
Oh, I can stand on my own two feet
And I know that this is best for you and me
Believe me, it's not easy, I can feel the pain
It hurts so much to leave, but not enough to stayTake me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
You see that girl with the red dress on,
Some folks call her Dinah
Stoled my heart away from me
Way down in Louisiana
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
The big bee sucks the blossom
And the little bee makes the honey
Poor man throws the cotton
And the rich man makes the money
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
We travel all over this country wide
Playing music by the hour
Always wear this great big smile
We never do look sour
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Would I go
You
Let me off
And I'll walk down to Greenwood
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marryLast night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand.
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine.
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, "I need you!"
"Take me away from here and be my man."
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.
Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a guy with a drink in his hand.
He had bay blue eyes, coal black hair
And a smile that a girl understands.
Then he came and sat down at my table,
And as he placed his hands over mine,
I found my self wanting to kiss him
For temptation was flowing like wine.
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and he whispered, "I need you!"
"Let me take you away and be your man."
Then I looked into his eyes and I saw it:
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.He's Cadillac Jack Favor and the name rings true
If he's got a ride any stranger would too
The one bad habit that his Ponder would say
Is sure gonna put him through the trials one day
And that's just what happened he took pity on two men
Heading down to Louisiana, he stopped and let them in
And the thanks he did for helping them
Would make him wish he was busting broncs again
He dropped them off in Bossieer City where they met up with a man
That vagabond commitee barely even had a plan
It was just a simple robbery turned double homicide
They got away with murder it'd be someone else's hide
Almost two years come and gone they never solved that crime
'Til they found one of our vagabonds already doing time
When that jailbird started singing they all knew the words were wrong
But the sheriff and the DA and the judge all sang along
They pinned it on Jack Favor, gave him life without parole
Gave Jack's freedom to the jailbird, payment on the lies he told
Just so happens that election year everybody payed out at the polls
Cadillac's no fallen hero and he's never gonna break
When it comes to prison rodeo, there'll be no easy eight
And if you want the definition of the picture-perfect frame
It'd be in the dictionary underneath Jack Favor's name
Cadillac's no fallen hero and he's never gonna break
When it comes to prison rodeo, there's still no easy eight
And if you want the definition of the picture-perfect frame
It'd be in the dictionary underneath Jack Favor's name
Yeah, it's the world's most crooked picture and when it comes to being framed
Cadillac Jack Favor should be in the hall of fameI never knew what this could do seeing another woman with you
But I can't stay here 'cause I would never get over you baby
That would do I gotta get loose
Somebody take me out of this place
Keep my eyes from seeing your face 'cause
You love her where you once love me darling
I can't believe it's true oh no.
[Chorus:]
It's not my affair anymore
You're not my man to care for
It's not my affair anymore
I'll close the door
So many things we've lefted unsaid
So many questions in my head well I never
Lock the back door ooh
And somehow you keep slipping on in taking me back once
Again to a memory trail like a shadow from a feeling
And it just grow don't I know
[Chorus]
Remember all of the laughter
Remember ooh the morning laughter remember
Moonlight the candle the shady light
Remember and it seen so right.
[Chorus]
Remember moonlight the candle light the shady light
Remember ooh and it seen so right.
[Chorus]
It's not my affair anymore.TO YOU AND YOURS (FROM ME AND MINE)

RECORDED BY GEORGE HAMILTON 1V
Wedding bells are ringing on two sides of town tonight
One wedding it's at seven one's at nine
A pair of old sweethearts will hold their new sweethearts so tight
Best of luck to you and yours from me and mine
To you and yours may happiness flow free
May you find in him the faith you lost in me
And although I don't love her yet perhaps I will in time
Best of luck to you and yours from me and mine
I'm afraid to say I do for fear I really done
Afraid my conscience might not walk the line
For even though I'll kiss her lips it's your lips that I want
That's a difference in you and yours and me and mine
To you and yours...OUR HEARTS ARE HOLDING HANDS
(Bill Anderson)

RECORDED AS A DUET BY ERNEST TUBB AND LORETTA LYNN
We're far apart but our hearts are holding hands
Yes it's hard to sit here by myself each night
Not knowing where you are or when I'll hold you tight
Yes I have temptations sometimes it's pretty rough
But temptation's never strong as our sweet love
Cause our hearts are holding hands across the miles
Even though we're lonely we can smile
Cause I know you're my woman and I know you're my man
We're far apart but our hearts are holding hands
oday a stranger looked my way and flashed his gold
And said he'd buy me all the treasures I could hold
But I took out your last letter where you wrote you love me so
And there I found the strenght to tell him no
Cause our hearts are holding hands...
And come what may our hearts are holding handsAfter three good years together we had our first big fight
So she went to her mother's and I went for a ride
Down an old familiar highway, just a few miles out of town
To that rundown one-room tavern that used to be my stomping ground
Well I pulled in the driveway, you know it all still looked the same
And I couldn't wait to down a few and hear that jukebox ring
Well as I walked into the doorway, oh there stood some kind of Matre D'
Well he looked me up and he looked me down, said
"May I help you please?", and I said
"What'd you do with those swinging doors?
Where's the sawdust, on the floor?
Why's everybody wearing suits and ties?
From where I stand I can't believe my eyes
And who's idea was it to hang these furs?
This brand new bar don't have a single burn
I guess I'm somewhere that I don't belong
I need a jukebox with a country song"
Well I look back to the corner where the jukebox once stood proud
Some fool was playing records, too fast, too long, and too loud
And it must have been a big mistake to try to speak my mind
So as they were asking me to leave I cried out one more time
What'd you do with those swinging doors?
Where's the sawdust, on the floor?
Why's everybody wearing suits and ties?
From where I stand I can't believe my eyes
And who's idea was it to hang these furs?
This brand new bar don't have a single burn
I guess I'm somewhere that I don't belong
I need a jukebox with a country song
I guess I don't belong without a jukebox and a country songDig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling, can you picture this?
Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat, the heat between me
How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
And maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
And maybe I'm just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like when doves cry
Touch if you will my stomach
See how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you, even doves have pride
Just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
And maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
And maybe I'm just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like when doves cry
How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
And maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
And maybe I'm just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
But this is what it sounds like when doves cryHe-he-he-he-he lets see here now, one, n1330-1164-7235-4284-2048-4065ine hunderd
Hm-hm-hm boy, I sure hope I get a purdy'n.
Maybe she'll look like Terry Clark or Faith Hill or somebody.
Hm, hope this ain't a party line.
Here we go!
Ha-ha. I's laid up 'na house watchin' C.M.T.
Thought I'd have a late night snack
So I headed to the kitchen on a commercial break
When sup'm called me back
It was the sexiest voice that I'd ever heard
Comin' out of my television set
Said, "Call now, you can hear me live
And I'll tell ya 'bout my naughtiness."
So without hesitation or further ado
I grabbed a hold of my Visa
And dialed the number flashin' on my screen
1-900-SHEILA
You can tell it all to me
I'm your phone fantasy
1-900-SHEILA
Oh man! Ah
So I kicked back the recliner
And on the second ring
She whispered, "Hello. This is Sheila.
Your credit card number, please."
I said, "How much will it cost
For this here trip to paradise?"
She said, "You can't put a price on love"
That's another $4.98 minute went bye
After an hour of conversation
She had me chewin' on the receiver
Well, I worked up a sweat, I's out of breath
Over 1-900-SHEILA
You can tell it all to me
I'm your phone fantasy
1-900-SHEILA
Like a man possessed I dialed her number
Mornin' noon and night
And slowly but surely we fell in love
As my phone bill shot out of sight
After so many costly heart to hearts
I just had to meet her face to face
She wouldn't give me her home address
So I had her number traced. He-he.
Well, I thought it'd lead to a passion palace
Some penthouse in the sky
And, I must admit I was a little let down
When I found her in a double wide
A double wide?
That beauty that I envisioned
That goddess that drove me crazy
Answered the door with a cigar in her mouth
And weighin' in at over two eighty. He-he-ho!
They say love conquers all, well I reckon it's true
Even when it's for a fee
We said I do, and now were one
Though she makes two of me
And she talks to me no charge
Every time she takes a breather
And I'll never have to work
As long as all you jerks dial
1-900-SHEILA
You can tell it all to me
I'm your phone fantasy
1-900-SHEILA
I love you baby. Come here to me. Smooch-smoochWhen you found somebody new I thought I never would
Forget you for I thought then I never could
But time has taken all the pains away until now I'm down to hurtin' once a day
Once a day all day long and once a night from dusk till dawn
The only time I wish you weren't gone is once a day every day all day long
[ steel ]
I'm so glad that I'm not like a man I knew one time
He lost the one he loved then slowly lost his mind
He sat around and cried his life away lucky me I'm only crying once a day
Once a day all day long...
Once a day every day all day longYou got a cousin who's tellin' you somethin' that doesn't have nothin'
To do with the love that we're in, baby
I hear she's sayin' this game we're playin' should be complicated
If you won't, I'll say it, I think she's crazy 'cause
Love don't have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock-down, drag-outs cryin' in the rain
It's alright to keep it light now mama, don't you think
We're having such a good time together, and it's only just begun
My heart's never smiled so hard, baby, loving you is fun
It's fun
I'm walking around all over this town, ten feet off the ground
So happy I found you, baby, I love it
There's no self-help book on your shelf, you know too well
They're tryin to sell you somethin' for nothin' 'cause
Love don't have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock-down, drag-outs cryin' in the rain
It's alright to keep it light now mama, don't you think
We're having such a good time together, and it's only just begun
My heart's never smiled so hard, baby, loving you is fun
Love don't have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock-down, drag-outs cryin' in the rain
It's alright to keep it light now mama, don't you, think
And we're having such a good time together, and it's only just begun
My heart's never smiled so hard, baby, loving you is fun
This ol' heart's never smiled so hard
Lovin' you is fun
Yeah it's, fun
Yeah it's, fun
Lovin' you is fun(Gale Garnett)
We'll sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way
I will never love you
The cost of love's too dear
But though I'll never love you
I'll live with you one year
And we will sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way
I'll sing to you each morning
I'll kiss you every night
But darlin', don't cling to me
I'll soon be out of sight
But we can sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way
My daddy he once told me
Hey, don't you love you any man
Just take what they can give you
And give but what you can
And you can sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way
And when our year has ended
And I have gone away
I'll often speak about you
And this is what I'll say
You know we sang in the sunshine
We laughed every day
We sang in the sunshine
Then I went on my way[Chorus]
Back up buddy, don't you come any closer
I know you want her but the answer is 'No sir'
Back up buddy don't you come any closer, she's mine all mine
Oh buddy, I've seen you winking your eyes at the dolly I've got with me
I'll whittle you down to a punier size if you don't let her be
She's pretty and cute as a doll could be, she's a-loving and a-cuddling too
But her cuddlesome charms are only for me and not for the likes of you
[Chorus]
Oh buddy I've seen you making your play for the baby doll on my arm
You'd better back up and get out of my way, I'd hate to do you harm
I'll give you a hint that'll help you a lot, get a doll that's all your own
I'll give you most any thing I got but leave my baby alone
[Chorus]
I'm crazy in love and maybe that's why I'm a little bit jealous too
So back away boy, don't give her the eye, don't make me mad at you
I never have been the troublesome kind but it never too late to start
And trouble is what the joker will find that flirts with my sweetheart
[Chorus]I can take a little cement and mend our patio
I can fill in all the rough spots so they won't even show
I can mend a roof of shingles with a hammer and some nails
But baby when I try to mend your broken heart I fail
I can't mend it I can't mend it
Your big heartbreak was my mistake but I did not indent it
I lost my head and words were said but that's no cause to end it
Give me the parts to patch your heart I can't mend it
I can hand a shaky table and mend the legs with glue
I can send it down and paint it so you'd think it was new
I can mend a shattered window that a storm has torn apart
But I don't know which way to go to mend your broken heart
I can't mend it...
I can't mend it...[Daddy what if the sun stop shinin' what would happen then]
If the sun stopped shinin' why you'd be so surprised
You'd stare up at the heavens with those big blue eyes
And the wind would carry all of your light up to the skies
And the sun would start shinin' again (and the sun would start shinin' again)
[But daddy what if the wind stopped blowin' what would happen then]
If the wind stopped blowin' then the land would be dry
And your boat wouldn't sail and your kite wouldn't fly
And the grass would see all of your troubles and she'd tell the wind
And the wind would start blowin' again (and the wind would start blowin' again)
(But daddy what if the grass stopped growin' what would happen then)
If the grass stopped growin' why you'd probably cry
And the ground would be wathered by the tears from your eyes
And then like your love for me the grass would grow so high
Yes the grass would start growin' again (yes the grass would start growin' again)
[But daddy what if I stopped lovin' you what would happen then]
If you stopped lovin' me then the grass would stop growin'
The sun would stop shinin' and the wind would stop blowin'
So honey if you want to keep this old world a goin'
Well you better start lovin' me again [again]
You better start lovin' me again [but I love you daddy]
You do you mean you were just teasin' me [I was just teasin']
Well come o'er put your arms around me I'll tell you a story [I'm sorry]You say tomorrow you're going it's so hard for me to believe
I'm making plans for the heartaches cause you're making plans to leave
The tears for me will be falling like a tree shedding its leaves
I'm making plans for the teardrops cause you're making plans to leave
You're making plans to forget me I'm making plans to miss you
I'm getting ready to grieve
I'm making plans to be lonesome cause you're making plans to leave
I'm making plans to be lonesome cause you're making plans to leaveA big black dog
A little too much gray around the muzzle
A big black dog
Why she ended up at the pound is a puzzle
A big black dog
Did she run away
Because somebody didn't treat her right?
Did they leave her out in the cold
Night after lonely night
A big black dog
A big black dog
I found her one day down there at the metro
A big black dog
Waitin' in a cage in line for the death row
Big black dog
Did somebody her put here out on the road
And did just not care?
Did they think an old dog was too much trouble
For them to bear?
A big black dog
Her name is Bella, Bella
You're not brown, you're not yella
Bella, Bella
My big black dog
Big black dogs, they're everywhere
Lookin' for a home, they're hungry and scared
All they need is food and attention
They'll give you back love,
Sometimes redemption I swear
You could find it there
In a big black dog
A big black dog
She may be a little rough around the edges
A big black dog
When you throw a ball, she'll always go and fetch it
This big black dog
With a brand new leash and a brand new collar
It's a brand new game
I love to see the way she runs to me when I holler
Out her name
My big black dog
Her name is Bella, Bella
You're not brown, you're not yella
Bella, Bella
My big black dog
My big black dogI'm sorry for my lack of communication
But as I'm staring out this fifth floor window
It seems like the least amount of communication the better
Oh, well what am I supposed to say
"There's a bloody effigy on my wall
And the complimentary carnation is falling apart"
And I ain't got time for the niceties
Or rather I was never, never fond of the niceties
I will see you around
I will see you around
See you around
See you around
Well I must admit I'm flattered by your consecration
It's a mind-numbing spine-chilling
But never-the-less heartwarming gesture
But as you make your advances so clumsily
I'll save us both the both the hassle and leave
And hang out all night
In the familiar fluorescent light of Dunkin' Donuts
'Cause I ain't got time for the niceties
Or rather I was never, never fond of the niceties
I will see you around
See you around
See you around
See you around
Well, how are you with issues
Lately you've been a half-assed activist
You've been seen sashaying around the picket line
Wearing scarcely any sign
Oh, but always vocal in love and strife
And the politics of your all important life
Well, I'm sorry but your routine is coming off a bit ragged
And I ain't got time for the niceties
Or rather I was never, never fond of the niceties
I will see you around
I'll see you around
See you around
I'll see you aroundYou and I gunna make a brand new start
Drag all we own out to the front yard
Make a big sign "Everything is free"
that's the last this town'll see of you and me
Hang on Annabelle
We gunna find ourselves down that long highway
Hang on Annabelle
We gunna ride like hell, down that long highway
It's a long highway
Got all our cash stashed in a coffee can
Sleep in the backseat of this old sedan
Just like a bullet screamin' down the road
Straight into the heart of the great unknown
Hang on Annabelle
We gunna find ourselves down that long highway
Hang on Annabelle
We gunna ride like hell, down that long highway
It's a long highway
[instrumental]
Hang on Annabelle
We gunna find ourselves down that long highway
Hang on Annabelle
We gunna ride like hell, down that long highway
It's a long highway
such a long highwayA calloused right hand
Holds a shiny gold watch
For thirty rears spent on the clock
But you won't see no tears
From this working class hero
He's always been hard as a rock
But he knows he's too old
To really start over
Besides he just wouldn't know how
I guess he's just glad
That he's not alone
But he's got to wonder what now
There's no hall of fame for that working class hero
No statues carved out of stone
And his greatest reward is the love of a woman
And his children
So after he's gone
That old working class hero lives on
Well that three-bedroom house
He build in the '50s
Seems so much bigger today
With just him and mama
And not many bills
'Cause all of the kids moved away
What he's done with his life
Might not be remembered
But he's got every right to be proud
'Cause the blood sweatin' years
Of this workin' class hero
Is really what livin's about
'Cause there's no hall of fame for that working class hero
No statues carved out of stone
And his greatest reward is the love of a worman
And his children
So after he's gone
That old working class hero lives on
Yea, that working class hero lives onMammie delivered me into this world
Mammie watched my mama die at my birth
And Mammie she loved me she took me to raise
Mammie was all I had on this earth
Let's get in the firewood, I'd hear Mammie say
Let's go to the spring before it gets dark
And you do up the dishes while the water's still hot
And don't throw that dishwater out in the yard
Oh Mammie taught me how to sing a song
She taught me to play her old guitar
And at night before bedtime we'd sing for hours
As the teakettle whistled along on the fire
And at night as I laid alone in my bed
I'd hear Mammie praying and each night she said
Oh dear God help me raise her to know right from wrong
And I pray she'll do right even after I 'm gone.
I'd wait until Mammie had fallen asleep
Then out of my window I'd quietly sneak
And I'd wait by the mill pond according to plans
And there in the darkness I'd meet a man
Oh it's not that I wanted to bring Mammie shame
I just couldn't control wild blood in my veins
They tell me my mama could not name my dad
So I guess it was natural for me to be bad
One night I awoke at the sound of my name
Come quickly, I heard Mammie cry
She said you be good and I told her I would and
That night I watched as my Mammie died
All I have now are the memories of Mammie
And the goodness that loving her brought me
Although she is gone in my heart she lives on
And I know how much good she taught me.
Ah Mammie, I'm being good Mammie ...Love come closer
Breaks me down to see you in the pains of fear
The depths of your stone true eyes
Are reflecting every burden of this life we bear
My words can`t slide the truth to you
Tomorrow every trial of life is going to fall
I can only make guesses
On some of my past addresses
And tell you what my broken memory recalls.
The first time I saw you
My heart became the ruler of my mind
The shadows of your motions
Lingered way beyond the statements I intended timed
The tears you hold from flowing
Are the blood of the saints that shield the broken heartThey say a man's home is his castle and he's like a king on a throne
It may be a shack down alongside of track but everything in it's his own
So don't think of taking his loved one it's written Thou shall not steal
So don't rob another man's castle no matter how lonesome you feel
Now don't rob another man's castle don't take his treasures away
Strange as it seems when you steal a man's dreams
You'll never know how much you'll pay
So don't rob a man of his loved ones you'll break his heart don't you see
I robbed another man's castle now someone just took her from meDon't waste your time givin' me your reasons
Let's skip the ceremony of goodbye
Let's get down to the part where you are leavin'
You can space me all the who, what, when's and whys
[Chorus]
Go on and go
Just hit the road
You won't find me standin' in your way
If you're not happy with me
Then I'll gladly set you free
Go on and go away
You want to talk this through to make it easy
A break-up just as painless as can be
And there's that line that you never meant to hurt me
Well, you're just trying to clear your conscience as you leave
[Chorus:Repeat x2]Don't call my name out your window, as I'm leavin'
'Cause I won't even turn my head
And don't send your kin folk to give me no dang talkin'
'Cause I'll be gone like I said
You'd can say the same ole things
That you've been sayin' all along
Just lay there in your bed
And keep you mouth shut 'till I'm gone
No, Don't give me that old familiar, cry n' cuss n' moan
Understand your man
Oh, Understand your man
huh.
Oh, party boys
You can give my other suit to the Salvation Army
And everything else I leave behind
I ain't takin' nothin' that'll slow down my travelin'
While I untangle my mind
No, I ain't gonna repeat what I said anymore
While I'm breathin' air that ain't been breathed before
Yet, I'll be as gone as a wild goose in winter
Then you'll understand your man (meditate on it)
You'll understand your man (You hear me talkin, now?)
Understand your man (I told you so)
Understand your man
Huh,
Oh hu.
Understand your man
Understand your man
Understand your man
Understand
Understand your man...She's perfect for a cotton dress
Pretty when her hair's a mess
A little wine and she gets a little loud
Once or twice she's bleached my jeans
She's been known to burn the beans
But in my heart there's never been a doubt
She's right as rain on a thirsty cornfield
Right on the money 'bout the way that I feel
A cool breath of fresh air
When life tries to burn me down
She's right behind me when I doubt myself
With a little push and a hand to help
A Quiet comfort on a troubled night
Right beside me, yeah, she's always right
Well she's the first to speak her mind
Never been the quittin' kind
She likes chocolate about as much as she likes me
She likes talking on the phone
Calls the mall her second home
I love that girl
Yeah, she's just right for me
She's right as rain on a thirsty cornfield
Right on the money 'bout the way that I feel
A cool breath of fresh air
When life tries to burn me down
She's right behind me when I doubt myself
With a little push and a hand to help
A Quiet comfort on a troubled night
Right beside me, yeah, she's always rightDust on the dashboard
Rust on the backdoor
Daddy paid cash for that old four door
Ford Fairlane
Bottle on the floorboard
Butts in the ash tray
Where he sat and talked to Mama
After she passed away
Sittin' on some Goodyears
Parked there in the drive way
But he just let it go?
A hand carved minnow
Hanging from a cane pole
Laying in the trunk getting ready to go
In case we passed a hole we had to fish
Crack in the window
Where Dad pitched me one soft an low
Had to duck his head
Mama said, I guess he's got the hang of it
Until now I didn't know
Why he never got that window fixed
But he just let it go?
[Chorus:]
The carburetor needs a kit
The drivers side visor's ripped
It's gettin a little hard to shift
And the knobs are missing off the radio
It's lost its glossy candy apple shine
The ink is faded on the for sale sign
The only driver that car ever owned
First million dollars takes it home
The three on the tree was tough
My feet barely reached the clutch
But Daddy let me fire it up, back it out and pull it in
Dent in the fender
Sand in the seat where I found the pin that fell from her hair
The night that me and Becky lost it
Sixteen when I stole those keys
I guess he'd been where we'd been
'Cause he just let it go?
[Chorus:]
Dust on the dashboard
Rust on the backdoor
Wouldn't take a million dollars for
That old four door Ford FairlaneThe very first time I ever saw my Tommy love
He came dancing into my room
And I felt the sunlight sparkle warm
Out from his magic shoes
And he danced so proud
And he laughed so wild
And he charmed me like a piper
When he smiled
So dance with me, dance with me, sing with me can't you see
I'm following the rainbow kissed strands of your magic carol
Follow your joyful song anywhere, anywhere my raggedy magical music man
For I am only your tag along raggedy, anne and I want you to hold me
As long as your raggedy magical music carol can
He asked me if I'd like to have my own parade
I answer yes and he blew his golden horn
Then the violins and the trumpets rang out he led them all
In a coat of many colors patched and torn
And he swung me to a loving sound
While the fiddlers played and pranced around
He spun so fast 'til we left the ground
Then the music filled the heavens with a joyful noise
The stars would dance to greet us as we'd come
Then he'd wave his hand and send them back to the morning light
And we'd keep climbing through the midnight sun
On a rocking horse with wings we'd fly
To a place where dreams can never die
Lovers little children in the sky
So dance with me, dance with me, sing with me can't you see
I'm following the rainbow kissed strands of your magic carol
Follow your joyful song anywhere, anywhere my raggedy magical music man
For I am only your tag along raggedy-anne and I want you to hold me
As long as your raggedy magical music carol can
And when it came time for my Tommy love to leave
I begged him please to stay and save my soul
And with a fading voice I heard him say as he(Dolly Parton)
Daddy was an old time preacher man
He preacher the word of God throughout the land
He preached so plain a child could understand
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man
He told the people of he need to pray
He talked about God's wrath and judgement day
He preached about the great eternity
He preached hell so hot that you could feel the heat
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man
Aunt Leanona would get up to testify
And we'd sing "In The Sweet By And By"
The we'd sing "I'm On My Way To Canaan Land"
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man
Revivals and camp meetings went for weeks
Folks came from all around to hear him preach
Daddy said if one is saved it's worth it all
But the aisles were always filled at altar calls
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher manYou say you've found another another you love better
You say you're gonna leave me pack up and go
You don't want to hurt me but you've just gotta have him
And how will I take it you want to know
Well if you can live with it I can live without it
If you can face your conscience I can face my pride
If you can live with it I can live without it
Cause I did the only thing I could do baby I tried
Can you really take your rings off without feeling kinda dirty
Can you really kiss him while you're wearing my name
Can you run your fingers all across his body
Without missing me a little and feeling ashamed
If you can live with it[ Nat ]
I remember when I was a lad times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver lining behind every cloud
Just poor people that's all we were tryin' to make a livin' out of black land dirt
We'd get together in a family circle singin' loud
[ Both ]
And daddy sings bass mama sings tenor me and little brother would join right in there
Cause singin' seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long we'll rejoin them in a song
We'll join the family circle at the throne
No the circle won't be broken by and by Lord by and by
When daddy sings bass mama sings tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there in the sky Lord in the sky
[ Connie ]
Well I remember after work mama would call in all of us
And you could hear us singin' for a country mile
Though little brother has done gone on we'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while
[ Both ]
And daddy sings bass mama sings tenor...
In the sky Lord in the skyI smell it a little bit
In the air tonight
I feel it a little bit on the wind
I turn my collar up
For the evenin' ride
Sad to see the summer's gone again
CHORUS:
But tonight it's more than autumn
Chillin' in my blood
And tonight it's more than summer
Goin' down and gettin' gone
For tonight I feel a loneliness
Deeper than the mud
And I feel the fall comin' on
There wasn't anything different
In the way she said goodbye
But it was somethin' missin' in her kiss
Somethin' turned cold
When she looked me in the eye
And I shivered like an aspen in the whisper of the wind
CHORUS
And I could fight like a warm wind blowin' on the breeze
Driftin' like our summer memories
But a cold rain starts a blizzard that goes blowin' through the leaves
That keep fallin' like me
So I'll keep my eye
To the western sky
Try to find shelter from the rain
And hope that she believes
That I believe her when she lies
Make my getaway before the pain rushes in
CHORUS
And I feel the fall comin' on
And I feel the fall comin' onAren't we the same two people
Who took those vows that mean nothing now
Didn't we sit at this table as husband and wife
Now we're on opposite sides
Is this the way love ends
With paper and pen
[Chorus]
It's all there in black and white
All the words that separate our lives
It's all there, wrong or right
But love falls between the lines
It's something you can't write
In black and white
Can we forget all the good times
And never look back, it is as easy as that
Can we be sure that it's finished
With tears in our eyes, can we say that we tried
It's all come down to this
Is there something that we missed
[Chorus]
I've told my friends, you've told yours
But opening and closing doors swing both ways
Is it too late
[Chorus]WHY DON'T WE DO THIS MORE OFTEN
(Allie Wrubel - Charles Newman)
'58 Francis Day & Hunter Music
Why don't we do this more often just what we're doing tonight
Gee but it's great to get together again why does it only happen now and then
We ought to do this more often don't you will agree that I'm right
We make each other laugh we make each other sing
And you can never ever overdue the good things
So why don't we do this more often just what we're doing tonight
Baby just what we're doin' tonight
Gee but it's great to get together again
Why does it only happen now and then
Don't you will agree that I'm right
We make each other laugh...
Just what we're doin' tonightLast night I walked down that little country lane
And a million memories ran through my mind
Where I used to walk with you now I walk with someone new
And I'm learning to love her with time
Yes I'm learning to love her cause you've gone and found another
It's the only way I know to ease my mind
She's not you but she loves me and I know she'll stay with me
And I'm learning to love her with time
[ piano ]
Well over there that old oak tree where you gave your love to me
It was here you said I'll love you for all time
But tonight she's here with me and she loves the hurt away
And I'm learning to love her with time
Yes I'm learning to love her...
Yes I'm learning to love her with timeThe passion of lust burns fast and it burns high
But when it was over I wanted to cry
Now I know what I want out of life and that's for you to love me the rest of my life
For holding another woman I know I'll pay
But I wonder can you still love me after yesterday
I've told you all about and I know that I was wrong
I can't explain it just happened I was weak and I was wrong
Now I know what I want out of life and that's for you to love me the rest of my lifeHere are some samples of the fabric, Miss Morgan
I know how painful it must be
But I guess it's your responsibility
I understand he was your fiancee
What a tragedy
Everybody wants to go to heaven, Miss Morgan
But nobody wants to die
Have you often wondered why
And why are your eyes so dry
It would help to cry
This is a popular, dusty-rose velvet Miss Morgan
Or how about a satin brocade
Guaranteed not to fade
Or maybe you'd prefer another shade
Trimmed in gold or silver braid
Would you like a lemonade
There's no ice, I'm afraid
You can rest assured you have our heartfelt sympathy
(You can use our easy payment plan)
(Two hundred now and fifty when you can)
(We wanted you to know we understand)
La, la ,la, la, laThis year my fathers heros have all passed
Reagan, Waylon, June & Johny Cash
I have felt the earth deep in my bones
Are these growing pains or shifting stones?
Cars are standing still on 95
Waiting for the tunnel in straight lines
Past my hands, resting on the wheel
The skylines still an open wheel of steel
Would I lie
Would I lie
Would I lie
Just to get by
Im angrier than I have ever been
Were all throwing punches to the wind
Wheres the truth when everything is polled
Theyd sell Jesus fore his blood ran cold
Boys with guns and girls in mud stained skirts
This is how you paint the perfect world
Gasoline and gold pulled from the ground
Remember that when traffic slows you down
We all lie
We all lie
We all lie
Just to get byHere I go again
Back to that feeling
Of no worthy cause
To carry me on
'Cause my hearts been skipping
Like a flat rock on water
And with each ripple
The further I'm gone
Some say I'm sinking
To the muddy bottom
But somehow I'm sailing
To shores of white sand
I feel it raining
And the crosswinds are changing
Blowing my chances
To make it alone
But should you get lonesome
And your child need a mother
Just look for my traces
On shores of white sand
Some say I'm sinking
To the muddy bottom
But somehow I'm sailing
To shores of white sand
Yes, some say I'm sinking
To the muddy bottom
But somehow I'm sailing
To shores of white sand
Some say I'm sinking
To the muddy bottom
But somehow I'm sailing
To shores of white sand4-0-33

Well the two new people that's moved to the middle of the block
And we're at the top of the town and don't you think we're not
For we got love and happiness people envy us you see
For we found heaven right here on earth at at 4-0-33
Yes we found what most people are looking for
And it's not a lotta money to spend on a real fine car
But it's so when and where a bird flies and sings so free
And there's whole lotta winds in this little house at 4-0-33
The four thousandth block proves what true love can do
Once a lonely place but was sold to me and you
Oh all around the house you can see little children play
And they're not as a people's kids were proud to say
They are the symbol of our love for all the world to see
They're a part of heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33
And our love's on the day you can see many people drive by
For look at the house they think they fell from the sky
They say that this place would make them as happy as you and me
And the whole town's tryin' to buy our house at 4-0-33
The four thousandth block...
Oh all around the house you can see little children play...
We're not gonna sale our happy little house at 4-0-33
Wouldn't take a pretty thing for the love we had at 4-0-33It took a woman
It took a bully riding my back
To make me mad enough to fight
And a summer with my granddad
To find out what hard work's like
It took that football coach in high school
To make me tougher than the rest
And that first beer with my daddy
To put that first hair on my chest
It took a heart to heart with Jesus
To bring me to my knees
But it took a woman to make a man out of me
It took a pair of soft blue eyes
And a smile so sweet
To make me reach up high
And really dig down deep
She's made me so much more than who I used to be
It took a woman to make a man out of me
It took the first year we were dating
And drinking too much with the boys
For her to give an ultimatum
For me to have to make a choice
It took a want add in the paper
To sell that '68 Firebird
And buy that diamond ring I gave her
And rent out that little church
It took the day my baby girl was born
To make a tear roll down my cheek
It took a woman to make a man out of meIt's killin' me to write the word "goodbye"
I've wadded it up and tossed it a thousand times
We both know the reason
There ain't nothin' to explain
But I know that my leavin'
Will spare us both the pain
(Desiree), I can't hold you any longer
(Desiree), You love his money more than me
Now the taxi's at the gate
I guess all that's left to say
Is in teardrops at the bottom of the page
"I love you Desiree"
It'd be easier to leave if I were mad
But it's hard to lose the best you'll ever have
And to write this note to you
Was the hardest thing to do
But not as hard as bein' a poor boy
Who can't afford a girl like you
(Desiree), I can't hold you any longer
(Desiree), You love his money more than me
Now the taxi's at the gate
I guess all that's left to say
Is in teardrops at the bottom of the page
"I love you Desiree"
(Desiree), I can't hold you any longer
(Desiree), You love his money more than me
Now the taxi's at the gate
I guess all that's left to say
Is in teardrops at the bottom of the page
"I love you Desiree"
God, I love you, Desiree
I just can't take it anymore
(I won't be around for your goodbye)
(I won't be around for your goodbye)
Love his money more than me
(I won't be around for your goodbye)
Love his money more than me
(I won't be around for your goodbye)
Oh, you love his money and you love it more than me
(I won't be around for your goodbye)
Yeah, I was just a fool who couldn't see
(I won't be around for your goodbye)
Yeah, you love his money and you love it more than me(Hank Card)
Do not go to Tennessee
That is what my Daddy said
But I knew Daddy was a fool
I listened to myself instead
Do not go to Tennessee
'Cause it would be a big mistake
They will treat you like a dog
And never give you a fair shake
I was going out to Nashville; I was gonna be a star
I would have my name inlaid between the frets of my guitar
My videos would play on TNN and CMT
And the fans at Opryland would stand in line for me
And so I went to Tennessee
I was successful right away
I wrote a tune with Mr. Big
I got a deal with MCA
It was a Number One Hit Song
Although it took a week or two
Sometimes the wait seemed mighty long
Lord knows you've got to pay your dues
When I go back to Oklahoma
Everybody says, "Ooowee!"
Who would have thought a kid like that
Could be on nationwide tv?
I bought my Daddy a new home
Out on Lake of the Cherokee
He calls me on his mobile phone
To say he's glad I went to TennesseeWell, sometimes I wish we'd bought the kind
That folds out into a bed
But it ain't too bad if you lay on your side
And use the armrest for you head
Yeah, the springs are sprung and the center sags
And the stuffing is sticking out
But it's times like these, she ain't happy with me
I thank God for this old couch
Yeah, right about now, she's as P.O.'ed
As I've ever seen her be
And this pillow and blanket and a mighty dirty look
Tells me where I'm gonna sleep
I learned a long time ago, don't say nothing
And soon, she'll simmer down
And with a little bit of luck, we'll kiss and make up
Sitting right here on this old couch
Yeah, this old couch is a pretty safe place
While she blows off a little steam
Well, she's mad as hell but that's alright
She ain't getting rid of me
'Cause there ain't no quitting, just forgiving and forgetting
That's what love's about
And we both know, I'll never go no further
Than this old couch
It might take five minutes or take five days
It really all depends
On how long it takes for the begging and the pleading
To finally start soaking in
Yeah, and one of these days, I'm gonna learn
Not to stick my big foot in my big mouth
Yeah, and maybe then I won't have to spend
So much time alone, yeah, right
Yeah, this old couch is a pretty safe place
While she blows off a little steam
Well, she's mad as hell but that's alright
She ain't getting rid of me
'Cause there ain't no quitting, just forgiving and forgetting
Yeah, that's what love's about
Yeah, and we both know, I'll never go no further
Than this old couch, yeah, this old couch
Yeah, one potato, two potato, three potato, four potato
I'm a couch potato
"Hey honey, you still mad?
I'm sorry, a lot"Some people say theres no American dream
I hear them talking but they dont say a thing
I still believe youve got to give it to get
Baptize your every aspiration in sweat
I vow my head each night and roll up my sleeves
Cause buddy its a long hard road to Easy Street
Where all the cars go
Fast, fast, fast
When you step on the gas, gas, gas
Nobody else is gonna pass me up, going down the road
I want a great big house on the hill
Every pocket full of hundred dollar bills
Givin me a thrill, thrill, thrill, I aint never known
Is that asking too much?
Am I over the line, am I way out of touch?
Tell me am I losing my mind?
I know I wont never get enough
Is that asking too much?
Ive never been accused of dreaming too small
I never saw no shame in wanting it all
I guess thats just the curse of being born poor
No matter what you got you always want more
Everybody wants a lot, a little inside
Im not the only one with hungry eyes
That wants a car that goes
Fast, fast, fast
When you step on the gas, gas, gas
Nobody else is gonna pass me up, going down the road
I want a great bid house on the hill
Every pocket full of hundred dollar bills
Man, givin' me a thrill, thrill, thrill I aint never known
Is that asking too much?
Am I over the line, am I way out of touch?
Tell me am I losing my mind?
I know I wont never get enough
Is that asking too much?
I just wanna go fast, fast, fast
When I step on the gas, gas, gas
Nobody else is gonna pass me up, going down the road
I want a great big house on the hill
Every pocket full of hundred dollar bills
Man givin' me a thrill, thrill, thrill, I aint never known
When I step on the gas, gas, gas
You know I wanna go fast, fast, fast
Nobody better ever pass me up, going down the road
I gotta build me a house on the hill
Every pocket full of hundred dollar bills
Man, givin' me a thrill, thrill, thrill, I aint never known
Now is that asking too much[Chorus]
Whiskey, whiskey take my mind
Let me leave it all behind
Take me somewhere I can find
Someone to believe
Whiskey, whiskey be my friend
Don't you let me fall again
You can help me to pretend
She won't ever leave
Whiskey, whiskey tell me lies
You know she can hypnotize
If I look into her eyes
I'll be lost again
[Chorus]
Whiskey, whiskey keep your cool
Don't you let me be no fool
I'll be sitting on this stool
'Til the very end
[Chorus]EACH TIME YOU LEAVE
WRITER SCOTT WISEMAN
Each time you leave I die a little say I'm foolish if you will
But no matter how I try each time you say goodbye
My foolish heart just won't be still
Each time you leave I die a little I'm so afraid I'll lose you dear
Hold me and say that you'll always stay I only live when you are near
[ steel ]
Each time you leave I die a little...I've been hanging out with the rejects in the attic
Can't get out of my head the way you left
I've got a sense of belonging but what does it matter
And winter's on its way here to collect
I was born on the outskirts of a dream
My daddy was a miner of almost everything
I've been busting stones
Too proud to go back home
Admit that all my digging was in vain
But don't we talk different than we did
Am I more quiet than I've been
Don't you look brighter than the moon
Don't I look different without you
Don't I look different without you
I'm taking rain like an appaloosa hoofprint
And you know I'm drinking sunlight all day long
I'm opened up just like a dogwood flower
And winter's on its way here to collect
But don't we talk different than we did
Am I more quiet than I've been
Don't you look brighter than the moon
Don't I look different without you
Don't I look different without you
I was taken on the outskirts of a dream
I have been a miner of almost anything
Now I'll stop busting stones
I have to go back home
Admit that all my digging was in vain
But don't we talk different than we did
Am I more quiet than I've been
Don't you look brighter than the moon
Don't I look different without you
Don't I look different
Winter's on its way here to collect (Don't I look, don't I look)
Winter's on its way here to collect (Don't I look, don't I look)
Winter's on its way here to collect (Don't I look, don't I look)
Winter's on its way here to collect (Don't I look, don't I look)
Winter's on its way here without you
Winter's on its way here without youI love it when we're at a party in a down-town crowd
Oh but I can hear you call me baby with the music up loud
Red wine, good times, no I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's night life tonight that I, I want you to myself
And tonight I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound,
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh woah, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beating faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder, baby we won't beat the song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss, what are we waiting on?
And tonight I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound,
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beating faster in your chest
And tonight I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound,
A river rolling in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
And we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeatWhen the counting's done on the judgment day
All the things we cherish and we threw away
The angel who's defending me will surely say
See how he truly loved her
Oh how he truly loved her
When the counting's done
I will bare with shame
The catalog of selflessness against my name
But heaven will record that life could never quench the flame
That burns in my heart forever
Burns in my heart forever
When this life is through I'll still be loving you
I pray that god will let my love live on
When the counting's done
When the counting's done
And all truth is known
And I stand there in the blinding lights
Before gods throne
He'll say that the only thing that stop his heart
From turning to into stone
Was how he truly loved her
Oh how he truly loved her
When this life is through I'll still be loving you
I pray that god will let my love live on
When the counting's done
When this life is through I'll still be loving you
I pray that god will let my love live on
When the counting's doneIt's all in your mind that I'm leaving you I've been afraid you'd found somebody new
If I lost you it would break this heart of mine
I'm not leaving you it's all in your mind
You can't blame me for havin' my suspicions
When hearts are broken each and every day
Just listen to your heart and what it tells you don't listen to the lies that people say
It's all in your mind that I could let you go I tried to think you'd never hurt me so
For I know that I can't change this heart of mine
I'm not leaving you it's all in your mind
You can't blame me...Just because your love is gone don't think my life won't still go on
Because you wanted to have your fling it's not the end of everything
The world still turns the sun still shines there's lots of guys for hearts like mine
One never knows what tomorrow might bring it's not the end of everything
Just look at the things I still possess like a heart that is filled with emptiness
And the life of pure unhappiness two arms that hold just loneliness
My rule's overflowing with blue blue songs think of the nights I can spend all alone
And all of the days I can just sit and dream it's not the end of everything
It's not the end of everything[ Mary Lou ]
Two nights in the pourin' rain (in a motel in Dallas)
That's what made me love you (that's what made me love you)
Champagne in a dixie cup (you had a little and I had too much)
[ Both ]
That's what made me love you that's what made me love you
[ Mary Lou ]
There ain't no way that time can make a bad thing out of our love
[ Bill ]
In a hundred years I'll think back and I'll have the memory of
[ Mary Lou ]
A box of candy and a wilted rose (wrinkled sheets and wrinkled clothes)
[ Both ]
That's what made me love you that's what made me love you
[ Mary Lou ]
Champagne in a dixie cup (you had a little) yeah you had too much
But that's what made me love you (that's what made me love you)
Two nights in the pourin' rain (in a motel in Dallas)
[ Both ]
That's what made me love you that's what made me love youStrapped on my holster low across my hips
Two Colt .45's with white plastic grips
And I'd head west through our neighborhood
And they'd say 'Here comes young Billy
And he's up to no good'... yeah
I rode a trail through the neighbor's back yard
Shooting the bad guys through my handlebars
Known for my bravery both far and near
Being late for supper was my only fear
I miss Billy The Kid
The times that he had
The life that he lived
I guess he must've got caught
His innocence lost
I wonder where he is
I miss Billy The Kid
These days I don't know whose side to be on
There's such a thin line between right and wrong
I live and learn, do the best I can
There's only so much you can do as a man
I miss Billy The Kid
The times that he had
The life that he lived
I guess he must've got caught
His innocence lost
Lord, I wonder where he is
I miss Billy The Kid
I miss Billy The Kid
The times that he had
The life that he lived
I guess he must've got caught
His innocence lost
Lord, I wonder where he is
I miss Billy The KidThe dawn of springtime gave birth to a new love
For you and me but it was born too late
For we both had been placed in the arms of others
Cheated by the cold hands of fate
Fate has no conscience, no mercy for me and you
And the cold hands of fate wrote the book of who loves who
So let the snow of the winter cover our love
And for the sense of misfortune we'll pay
But we know in our hearts this love will live forever
Cheated by the cold hands of fate
And fate has no conscience, no mercy for me and you
And the cold hands of fate wrote the book of who loves whoI went to work for her that summer
A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needing something from each other
Not knowing yet what that might be
'Til she came to me one evening
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain
She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Out where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night
That summer wind was all around me
Nothing between us but the night
When I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered "That's alright"
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Out where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night
I often think about that summer
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace
And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And every time I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancing with the wind
Although I know it isn't real
I swear inside I feel
Her hungry arms again
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Out where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night
Rushing in long in the wind
Out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the nightI believe for every drop of rain that falls
A flower grows
And I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows
I believe for everyone who goes astray
Someone will come to show the way
Yes I believe
Oh I believe
I believe above the storm
The smallest prayer will still be heard
I believe that someone
In the great somewhere hears every word
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why I believe
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why I believe
I believe
Oh I believeborn like everyone with a slate as clean baby grew into a boy started building steam boy leared to blow it off in dangerous kind of way well fellas here he come that runaway train
now hear his lonsome cry barrelin ' down that track out of controll his soul dressed in black
sounds to every man thats broken the chain
rolling rolling rolling like a runnaway train
it ain't easy to do your best when life comes at you fast
on his own so early on too young for such a task took the bull by the horn sometime that bull was mean and only at it stroking on that runnaway train
rolling rolling rolling like a runnaway train
hmmmmmmmmmmmmm i hear that train a commmin
hmmmmmmmmmmmmm hey porter oh porter
hmmmmmmmmmmm i dont care if i do da do
married young and daddy soon his life was right track something rummbled in his soul that he had lack he had to to chase that melody that fueled a childhood dream there ain't no holding back that runnaway train
rolling rolling rolling like a runnaway train
hmmmmmmm i hear that train a commin
hmmmmmmmhey porter oh porter
hmmmmmmmmm i dont care if i do da doI was absolutely certain
I'd made up my mind
I'd never fall for you
Not in this lifetime
You said I was mistaken
I'd be yours in the end
I never thought it could happen
But baby you win
And I love being wrong when it feels like it feels tonight
I'd a whole lot rather be here in your arms than be right
Now that we're together, wish I hadn't waited so long
I'm finding out how much I love being wrong
Under normal circumstances
I think I know my stuff
But the rules all change
When it comes to love
It's the last thing I expected
Now it's all that I want
Just in case you're feeling guilty
Baby don't
'Cause I love being wrong when it feels like it feels tonight
I'd a whole lot rather be herein your arms than be right
Now that we're together, wish I hadn't waited so long
I'm finding out how much I love being wrongGreenfields backed by blue skies
'Bout as blue as your two true blue eyes
And I wonder do you feel the way I feel
When you see greenfields
Sometimes, oh, I wish you were still mine
And I'd go back in time and I'll always find
You in greenfields and you're layin' by my side
And love was real and I could taste it
On these lips of mine in
Greenfields backed by blue skies
'Bout as blue as your two true blue eyes
And I wonder do you feel the way I feel
When you see greenfields
When I see cotton candy clouds up in heaven
I close my eyes and then we drift away
And I'm loving you and holding on forever
There in your arms where I used to lay inWITH YOUR LOVE ON MY MIND
(Robert Ford)
Here I sit with your love on my mind I'm blue as a man can be
So long ago you told me you'll return
Now I've been waitin' so long you think I'd learned
Here I sit with your love on my mind I'm hoping praying saying you'll be mine
And now each day I'm havin' dreams without you
And though how I long for your return
So here I sit with your love on my mind I'm hoping praying saying you'll be mineInstrumental - there are no lyrics to this songAll the big fools in town got together
Every hopeless lovin' heart I know was there
We all sat around and told our own best story
Then they made me the big fool of the year.
Oh, they gave to me a little golden statue
Of the torch that I carried for you, dear
They said no one else could even come close to me
And that I was the big fool of the year.
I'll put mine up beside
Any foolish love in town
'Cause there's none can hold a light
To this torch I carried round.
I can't say I'm to proud of the honor
But then I guess I do deserve it, dear
For to love you after all you've made me suffer
Surely makes me the big fool of the year.I received the letter you wrote dear
In which you said you'd wait for me
I'm asking you to please not to wait dear
It will only ruin your life I see
Now please don't wait for me, darling
We could never be happy I know
I'll always be a next convict
And branded wherever I go
In three years my sentence is over
The gate will swing wide for me
The warden will say, I'm a free man
But my name will never be free
Please don't wait for me, darling [unverified]
May God bless you for your kindness
You've stuck with me through thick and thin
I love you too much to disgrace you in closing
God bless you again
Now please don't wait for me, darling [unverified]As I look at the letter that you wrote to me it's you that I am thinking of
As I read the lines that to me were so dear I remember our faded love
I miss you darling more and more every day as heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you and remember our faded love
[ fiddle - steel ]
As I think of the past and all the pleasures we had
And I watch the mating of the dove
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye I remember our faded love
I miss you darling more and more...
And remember our faded loveWhen I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in my cradle
In those old cotton fields back home
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in my cradle
In those old cotton fields back home
Oh, when those cotton ball get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields back home
It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in my cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in my cradle
In those old cotton fields back home
Oh, when those cotton ball get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields back home
It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In those old cotton fields back home
In those old cotton fields back homeI was forced to pay a bride's price
I couldn't look the other way.
She hooked me with her "fuck me" eyes,
They still haunt me to this day.
She says, "only you can know these secrets
Buried deep beneath my skin, only your tongue
Can uncover them."
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeaaah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeaaah
In a room as cold as Winter
I explored her with my hands.
She said, "darling you must forgive, in order to understand".
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeaaah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeaaah
My breathe it slowly left me
I snaked my way inside.
The next thing that I knew
You were not lying by my side.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeaaah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeaaah
In the end we find a single door
And all the things we should have done.
Piled high on all the surfaces,
Fears, excuses given.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeaaah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeaaah(Jason Carter / Scott Boyd / Dierks Bentley)
It's dark outside my window and cold without you near
I keep thinkin back on the times when you were mine
But rings and dreams don't matter cause I know you're with him tonight
And you've already left without a fight
Chorus
What can I do to make you believe my love is true
What can I say to keep you from walkin away
How can I make my heart believe we're really through
When it's not through loving you
The dawn will bring a new day and I suppose the sun will shine
But it won't bring back the light in my life
Cause I'm afraid I've waited too long to tell you how I feel
It's sad to think I lost you cause I couldn't lose my prideOur manager called said, 'We need to talk'
So I met him on the eighteenth floor
He said, 'Daryle, we need to change a couple of things
'Cause country ain't country no more'
We need a little more glitz and a little more glamor
A few fireworks and some half naked dancers
I said, 'Okay, that's fine with me
The only problem I see'
I still sing this way, the only way I know
Straight from the heart, a little through my nose
You can dress me up in leather pants
Put me in front of a rock 'n' roll band
I can dance around the stage but I still sing this way
I've had this Georgia Twain in my thing ever since I was a kid
There's a whole lotta Haggard Jones in my bones
What you hear is what you get
You can turn down the fiddle and steel guitar
Try to market me like a big pop star
I'm afraid it'll all go south when I open my mouth
I still sing this way, the only way I know
Straight from the heart, a little through my nose
You can dress me up in leather pants
Put me in front of a rock 'n' roll band
I can dance around the stage but I still sing this way
When it comes full circle and the fads die down
Hardcore country comes back around
I'll be waiting with a big ol' smile
Because I'll be back in style
I still sing this way, the only way I know
Straight from the heart, a little through my nose
You can dress me up in leather pants
Put me in front of a rock 'n' roll band
I can dance around the stage but I still sing this way
I can dance around the stage but I still sing this wayWriter Dorothy Jo Hope

Yes I see God where the mountains reach the sky
And I see God when the eagle starts to fly
I see God in a little baby's smile I see God and he makes my life worthwhile
Yes I see God when the bridegroom meets his bride
I see God in a father's loving eyes
I see God when a mother starts to cry I see God in a love that never dies
(I see God) where the people meet to pray (I see God) in the things they do and
say
(I see God) when the little children play
I see God and I know he's near all way
I see God yes I see GodMy whole world is a falling down falling down falling down
My whole world is a falling down I'm losin' my baby
You told me that your love for me was true
Said you would love your whole life through
But now you're asking me to set you free
You found somebody you love more than me
My whole world is a falling down
Where did she come from what's her name what did she do to set your heart a flame
I'm all alone while she's with you you're having fun my heart's breaking in two
My whole world is a falling down
I miss your loving that was so fine I need it I need oh all the time
I still love you in the same old way but I'm losin' you a little more every day
My whole world is a falling down
My whole world is a falling downOur love is unconditional
We knew it from the start
I can see it in your eyes
You can feel it from my heart
From here on after
Let's stay the way we are right now
And share all the love and laughter
That a lifetime will allow.
I cross my heart
And promise to
Give all I've got to give
To make all your dreams come true
In all the world
You'll never find
A love as true as mine
You will always be the miracle
That makes my life complete
And as long as there's a breath in me
I'll make yours just as sweet
As we look into the future
It's as far as we can see
So let's make each tomorrow
Be the best that it can be
I cross my heart
And promise to
Give all I've got to give
To make all your dreams come true
In all the world
You'll never find
A love as true as mine
And if along the way we find a day
It starts to storm
You've got the promise of my love
To keep you warm
In all the world
You'll never find
A love as true as mine
A love as true as mineYou've made up your mind
We don't want the same thing
And that we won't change things
Wishing there were ways
And there's no use staying together
Nothing lasts forever
That's what you say
And that makes one of us not in love
And that makes one of us who can't give up
If you can walk away from the life we've made
Then that makes one of us
I still believe we've got something worth saving
I keep hoping and praying for another chance
You've held my heart and your gonna break it
Cause you want to make it
A part of your past
And that makes one of us not in love
And that makes one of us who can't give up
If you can walk away from the life we've made
Then that makes one of usI had a friend named Camble, eat, cheat and steal and gamble
And I guess he tried most ever' thing low down
He was out tomcattin' one night when he started a great big fight
Then a big policeman came and snapped him down
He's in the jailhouse now, he's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice to quit drinking gin and shootin' dice
He's in the jailhouse now
A-yodeleyie, yodeleyie, oh-ohoohdeleyie
A-yodeleyie, odiyodeleyie, e-iyodeleyie
Old Bill broke out one day, I guess he thought he'd get away
But at the railroad station they took him by the arm
The chief said, "I've come for you", and Bil said, "Now this won't do
Because Bill Camble never was my name"
He's in the jailhouse now, he's in the jailhouse now
Oh yes, he broke out and all over town the fool walked about
He's in the jailhouse now
Then I met Bill's old gal Sadie and she said
"Have you seen my baby?"
And I told her he was down town in the can
Litlle Sadie she started fussin'
She went down to the jailhouse a-cussin'
She says, "I come down here to get my man"
She's in the jailhouse now, she's in the jailhouse now
So you can understand why little old Sadie got throwed in the can
She's in the jailhouse now
I went out last Tuesday, met a sweet little gal named Suzie
I'd say she was the sweetest thing around
She started to callin' me honey and we began to spent my money
Then we got drunk and thought we owned the town
We're in the jailhouse now, we're in the jailhouse now
Next day we wanted to go but that old jailer he said, "No"
We're in the jailhouse now
A-yodeleyie, yodeleyie, oh-ohohohdeleyie
A-yodeleyie, odiyodeleyie, a-ohiyodeleyieHello darlin' nice to see you it's been a long time
You're still the man that you used to be
How's your new love are you happy hope you're doing fine
Just to know it means so much to me
What's that darlin' how'm I doin' guess I'm doing all right
Except I can't sleep and I cry all night till dawn
What I'm tryin' to say is I love you and I miss you
And I'm so sorry that I did you wrong
Look up darlin' won't you kiss me just for old time sake
Won't you hold me in your arms one more time
Thank you darlin' may God bless you and may each step you take
Bring you closer to the things you seek to find
Goodbye darlin' I gotta go now I gotta try to find a way
To lose these mem'ries of the love so warm and true
And if you should ever find it in your heart to forgive me
Come back darlin' I'll be waiting for youI wish that I could find the way to make my yesterdays
Pack up and find themselves another home
I don't like to live with everything that's gone
When my lovin' lost its flavor and you wanted sweeter wine
How come you let your mem'ries here behind
They're with me from the dawn until the sundown on my mind
You're with me when the robin sings an early morning song
You're with me in the sunshine all day long
Your mem'ry's always with me when the Sandman knocks upon my door
And whispers it's a dreamin' time
You're with me from the dawn until the sundown on my mind
[ harmonica ]
I've heard them say a heartache's nothin' more than just a mem'ry
They say the hurt will leave when I'll forget
But I can't stop remembering you yet
If broken hearts were able to turn back the hands of time
I think I'd be the first to stand in line
You're with me from the dawn until the sundown on my mind
You're with me when the robin sings...
You're with me from the dawn until the sundown on my mindYesterday's tears are still fallin' yesterday's dreams are still broken
Yesterday's love is still livin' a love that will never be spoken
I've tried so hard to forget dear tried not too smart everything
You are the one who has given but all you've received dear is pain
My life has been such a sorrow my world has crumbled like clay
My heart has slowly been dying since you told me goodbye that day
[ guitar ]
Long weary years you have suffered to keep from hurting someone
If only I could repay you for all of the kind things you've done
You haven't spared me my darling everything to you I owe
All I can say is I love so much more than anyone know
So yesterday's tears are still fallin' yesterday's dreams are still broken
Yesterday's love is still livin' a love that will never be spokenESKIMO PIE

You can talk about your Frauleins and your pretty Geisha girls
And about the one you got in the USA
But I found myself a sweetheart in Alaska way up high
She's my Eskimo baby she's my Eskimo pie
She's my Eskimo baby she's my Eskimo pie
She lives south of the North pole and I know the reason why
She's my Eskimo baby and I'll love her till I die
She's my Eskimo baby she's my Eskimo pie
Crossing o'er the frozen river to a valley filled with snow
I lost all my directions and I knew not where to go
When a warm hand fell upon me and a voice said with a sigh
I would take you to my igloo Mister I won't let you die
Well she's my Eskimo baby...
And there came the day of parting and we had to say goodbye
As I crossed back o'er the river I could think I hear her cry
I know that someday I'll return I must before I die
Cause she's my Eskimo baby she's my Eskimo pie
Well she's my Eskimo baby...Your hunger after money
Your parents agree
The things you don't require
You kid yourself you need
Neglect the flower of love
Give your worship to the weed
Your just adding links to a long and heavy chain
The selfishness that drives
So much of what you do
That a fixes your attention
Completely up on you
Your record is take away much more than your due
Your just adding links to a long and heavy chain
A heavy chain gets longer all the time
What should be easy going
Turns into a mountain climb
A heavy chain gets heavier
Day by day
It keeps you anchored to the ground
So that your heart cant fly a way
The whiskey and the women
You use to blow your mind
Are deadly on their own
And double deadly when combined
They satisfy your senses but leave your soul behind
Your just adding links to a long and heavy chain
A heavy chain gets longer all the time
What should be easy going
Turns into a mountain climb
The heavy chain gets heavier
Day by day
It keeps you anchored to the ground
So that your heart cant fly a way
A heavy chain gets longer all the time
What should be easy going
Turns into a mountain climb
A heavy chain gets heavier
Day by day
It keeps you anchored to the ground
So that your heart cant fly a way
Your hunger after money
The whiskey and the women
It's a long and heavy chain
Such a long and heavy chainThat call was from the office and I guess I'll have to burn the midnight oil again
And hon' you know how much the boss depends on me to lend a helping hand
I watch him in the mirror as I lie and tell him I don't know how late I'll be
While I'm puttin' on my makeup I'm puttin' on the one that really loves me
The girls all got together and they called to see if I could have some fun tonight
But you know me the only thing I do is go to work and watch TV
And I watch him in the mirror as I lie and tell him I don't know how late I'll be
While I'm puttin' on my makeup I'm puttin' on the one that really loves me
And tonight I'll cheat again and tomorrow I'll be sorry
And I'll feel kind of dirty cause I'll have the midnight oil all over me
God knows his dream would shatter if he knew the devil had me and won't set me free
While I'm puttin' on my makeup I'm puttin' on the one that really loves me
While I'm puttin' on my makeup I'm puttin' on the one that really loves meKiss me, she said.
Don't let this moment pass you by.
You missed me, she said.
But I only closed my eyes for a second.
Let's forget about tonight,
and think tomorrow.
I can only think of one reason why I should go but,
I should go.
Don't leave, she said.
It seems she can't make up her mind.
Let's forget about tonight,
and think tomorrow.
I can only think of one reason why I should go but,
I should go.
I'll see you tomorrow,
I'll see you tomorrow,
I'll see you tomorrow.
Kiss me, she said.
Don't let this moment pass you by.
You missed me, she said.
But I only closed my eyes for a second.
Let's forget about tonight,
and think tomorrow.
I can only think of one reason why I should go but,
I should go.
Don't leave, she said.
It seems she can't make up her mind.
Let's forget about tonight,
and think tomorrow.
I can only think of one reason why I should go but,
I should go.
I'll see you tomorrow,
I'll see you tomorrow,
I'll see you tomorrow.In a pub Britanny, I had me a drink or three
I can vaguely recall, a pretty girl was standin' there
Ran her hand through my hair, took me off for some air
I hope we had a good time, for I woke without even a dime
I'm a sailor that's all that I am, I've been in many a land
Had a million girls but never have the urge to stay
I was born to be on the rollin' sea
That's where I'll be a livin' and I'll be a dyin' someday
Well, I copped me a ship once more that was bound for Singapore
I got in a card game that lasted for thirty some days
I made my shipmates sad, I took all they had
I taught those rosy cheek lads, they don't be underratin' ol' dad
I'm a sailor, that's all that I am
Three more days and we'll be in port, we'll have twenty four hours of sport
We'll spend our hard earned money, as fast as we can
Lift the glasses high and tell the pretty girls lies
And then we'll run for the harbor, that's the life of a sailor man
I'm a sailor that's all that I amWhat Child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ, the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary
So, bring Him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant, king to own Him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him
This, this is Christ, the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of MaryDarling this is my desire, set your little old heart on fire
Do the things that lovers always do
So put your little hand in mine I buy you diamond ring so fine
Then I'll build a bungalow for two
Closer, a little closer
Well there ain't no use to stay so far away
So darling turn on all your charms while I hold you in my arms
Let old Mother Nature have her way
Now my baby take a chance for I'm achin' for romance
And know that you were meant for me to love
You know your heart is beatin' fast, you know I'm gonna win at last
So cuddle up and be my turtle dove
Closer, a little closer
Well there ain't no use to stay so far away
I like to touch your lips to mine like to win your love divine
Let old Mother Nature have her wayWE FOUND IT IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS
(Hank Cochran - Red Lane)

We found it in each other's arms
My life was so confused till I found you
And you know I'm stumbled through a love or two
We needed a loving place safe from all harm
We found it in each other's arms
I've known this thing of losing heart and mind
And Lord knows I've seen some trouble times
The safest place to hide is the eye of the storm
We found it in each other's arms
We found it in each other's arms
A love so sweet so wild and yet so warm
The safest place to hide is the eye of the storm
We found it in each other's arms
We found it in each other's armsDon't get no attention from the people on the street
They don't even see us they just step right on our feet
Two unnoticed people in this great big world are we
And when I think about it I guess that's all we'll ever be
But I got you and you got me and if they look they can see that we don't care
I got you and you got me and baby that's all we will ever need
Looking through the window of a fancy diamond store
Goin' window shopping for the things we can't afford
People all around us with their noses in the air
They walk right on by us just like we're not even there
But I got you
Though the world around us hasn't time to know we're near
We don't feel neglected no we'll never shed a tear
We may go unnoticed but we'll never be alone
As long as we're together in a world that's all our own
Cause I got you
I got you and you got me and baby that's all we will ever needO COME ALL YE FAITHFUL
Writers Frederick Oakeley, John Francis Wade, John Reading
O come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant, O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem. Come and behold Him, born the King of Angels. O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord. Sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation O sing, all ye bright hosts of heaven above, Glory to God, glory in the highest, O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord. Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning, Jesus, to Thee be all glory giv'n. Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing, O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.She's a fool
And don't I know it
But a fool can have her charm
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a Baden arm (babe in arms)
And wild again and Gael again
Whimpering simpering child again
Bewitched bothered and bewildered Am I
I couldn't sleep wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me
I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched bothered and bewildered Am I
Lost my heart but what of it
She is cold I agree
She may laugh
But I'll love her
Although the laughs on me
I'll sing to her
Each spring to her
Long for the day when I cling to her
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am I
Music
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am I
Music
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am I
Music
Lost my heart but what of it
She is cold I agree
She may laugh
But I love her
Although the laughs on me
I'll sing to her each spring to her
Long for the day when I cling to her
Bewitched bothered bewildered am I
Bewitched bothered bewildered am IChildren be careful when playing with matches
Everything's dry and ready to burn Lord Lord
The neighbors are cooking out in the backyard
Just two doors down ain't nobody home (they're all busy)
Building fires strong desires
We've got to be careful there's too many people
Just down the street building fires
Now smoking in bed can sure burn your house down
Specially if you're there with somebody's wife
Temptation knocks and most people answers just neighborly lovers unsatisfied
Building fires strong desires
One two three stop it's time to change partners
You go get your good thing and I'll go get mine
Temptation knocks and most people answers
Just neighborly lovers yearning for more and more
Building fires strong desires
We've got to be careful there's too many people
Just down the street building firesSUGAR IN YOUR COFFEE
(Ray Griff)
'72 Blue Echo Music
I came downstairs and found the morning paper by my plate
A glass of orange juice waitin' there for me
I looked across the table and I saw the sweetest face
And she smiled at me and then I heard to say
Do you want sugar in your coffee honey on your toast
Or baby would you rather that I hold you close
Do you want scrambled eggs and bacon a bowl of shredded wheet
Do you want sugar in your coffee or loving warm and sweet
I watched her as she moved and knew that she was heaven sent
I lived again sweet memories in my head
I never knew real happiness or what it really meant
Until my baby turned to me and said
Do you want sugar in your coffee honey on your toast
Or baby would you rather that I hold you close
Do you want fingertips to touch you and kisses on your cheek
Do you want sugar in your coffee or loving warm and sweet
Do you want sugar in your coffee...Farmer Jones ran short on seeds so he borrowed from his neigbor Sam
The fall brought Jones a flourishin' crop while his neighbor's all burned brown
Sam had a wife and thirteen kids he worked to feed each day
With hungry pride he begged for help and he was turned away
He was forced to sell his farm for half its worth
To this man he thought a friend to be if there's not a hell there ought to be
Mary Ann was sweet sixteen never had been around
A child as pure as a mountain stream that ran through her hometown
Then happened by the slick Tom Shark in his hand she was clay
She got caught and faced the shame and he laughed and went his way
Now no one knows where she's at her folks sent her away
If there's not a hell there ought to be
Widow Brown worked since Joe died and tried to save her pay
To give nine children beans and bread and pretty ties on Sunday
She got sick and slipped behind the rent she had to meet
They told her they were sorry and they kicked her out in the street
And that same day they came and took her kids away
If there's not a hell there ought to be
Young Billy Brown he took a trip to keep his country free
We're all proud of what he done for the good old USA
But somewhere there's a mighty big man who kept this a goin' on
The personal game wealth and fame they did their league all wrong
All wrapped up in the stars and stripes Bill came home one day
If there's not a hell there ought to be if there's not a hell there ought to beOur love keeps drifting and you keep giving me to blame
I go on loving you although it's all in vain
You've stopped caring so what chance have you and I
I give my everything but you don't even try
I've done all I can do and I'm standing at the end
Although I know it's over my heart just won't give in
You've stopped caring so what chance have you and I
I give my everything but you don't even try
(I give my everything but you don't even try)
I've done all I can do...(Dolly Parton)
A broken heart like a broken wing
It must have its time to mend
I am like a crippled bird
In hopes one day to fly again
I loved you so and I was faithful
I cared more than words could say
But love is cruel and life is hateful
Now you've gone and flown away
Oh, to die, 'Twould be a pleasure
Slow to heal, but quick to cry
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to fly
Oh, the loss is cold and shameful
And the grief so deep and sharp
There is nothing quite as painful
As a true blue broken heart
Oh, to die, 'Twould be a pleasure
Slow to heal, but quick to cry
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to fly
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to flyWe will remain ignorant
Incapable of knowing
Insoluble is the problem
Curiosity, sleeping
Killed the caterpillar
Curiosity, empty
Is a blanket over the headWhen I was just a young girl my mama told me hon
What country's where you've been to what country's where you're from
Now I don't wanna hurt you honey can't you see
No I'm not in the country the country's still in me
I've got Carolina cousins Carolina kin (they're waiting there)
At the gates of almost heaven they'll let me in
My Carolina cousins will smile and say hello so for now I've gotta say goodbye and go
You found the country bluebird with a broken wing and tehn
You took her to the city and made her well again
But a hundred smilin' faces and a hundred voices call
Love you but I'm homesick so I'm leavin' after all
Cause I've got Carolina cousins...
Soon you'll get a letter to say I'll meet the bus
You'll just be there on it we'll make one of us
Someday if God's willin' you're gonna tell our son
What country's where you've been to boy what country's where you're from
And you'll have Carolina cousins...
Cause I've got Carolina cousins...MY BODY'S AT HOME (BUT MY HEART'S ON THE ROAD)
(Bill Anderson)
'67 Moss Rose Publications
RECORDED BY DAVE DUDLEY
I'm sittin' back easy in my easy chair
Watchin' the morning dawnin' fair
My wife's cookin' breakfast and my little girl
Is looking at her daddy like he owns the world
I've got everything that a man could want
My lips oughta smile but somehow they don't
I feel a guilty lamp in my throat
My body's at home but my heart's on the road
Alberquerque and New Orleans hamburgers and pinto beans
Big mountains and river beds happy anywhere I lay my head
I feel like I'm about to explode
My body's at home but my heart's on the road
I love my family and I always will
But I'm just no good when I'm sittin' still
A quiet kind of love and me don't mix
And you can't teach an old dog new tricks
So kiss me baby and hold me tight
I'll try to get back by Saturday night
I don't mean to hurt you Lord knows I don't
But my body's at home but my heart's on the road
Alberquerque and New Orleans...
Alberquerque and New Orleans...There is a house down in New Orleans
Down in the Vieux Carr'e
A house they call the rising sun
Where love and money are made
My father he was a gambler
Mother died when I was young
And I've worked since then
To please the men
At the house of the rising sun
There is a house
Down in New Orleans
They call the rising sun
It's been the ruin of many a good girl
And oh God, you know I'm one
So mothers you go telling all your daughters
Not to do what I've done
To live a life of sin, shame and strife
In the house of the rising sunMy eyes are perfect but now I see I'm blind
Because I didn't notice all those danger signs
I tried and tried to tell you oh so many times
You should reach for your baby but I reached for the wine
Remember I told you that someday you would find
Just you and your bottle at the end of the line
You'd still be here in my arms and not just on my mind
If you'd reach for your baby like I reached for the wine
If I could reach you just one more time
I'd show you I love you much more than the wine
Many nights my pillow feels these arms of mine
For they couldn't reach you cause I reached for the wine
[ steel ]
I'm sure you'll find someone who will be kind and true
That's the things I wanted but I wanted them from you
Our love could have lasted until the end of time
If I'd reach for you baby like I reached for the wine
If I could reach you...
My arms couldn't reach you cause I reached for the wineOnly you and you alone can take this lonely from my heart
And put a happy feeling there and make it grow
Only you and you alone can kiss my lips and hold me close
And whisper in my ear you'll always love me so
For it's you and you alone that lets me live and breathe and smile
And walk the highway to the stars that's in your eyes
If you'll let me I will love you more than life itself and keep you
If you'll only say forever you'll be mine
Only you and you alone only you and you alone
Only you can make the stars come out to sunshine golden yellow
And keep birds a singing songs of love's delight
Only you can take my heart and make it burst with love and tenderness
And filled with love and laughter every night
Only you and you alone can let me tell the world that you're my girl
And keep all other lovers from your life
Only you and you alone can let me feel that life's worth living
If you'll only say forever you'll be mine
Only you and you alone only you and you aloneI didn't know you were gonna be at that bar when I walked in
Til I walked in
I looked up, saw your face, turned around
And I walked back out again
Then I thought there's too much that we shared
So I made myself get ahold of myself
And walked back in
And went right up to you
I could feel you were caught off guard
Neither one of us knew just what to do
So I said
How ya been, been a while
Tell me how's your Mama
You said Good, you can sit down if you wanna
I said I was just thinkin' bout Oklahoma
The wild roller coaster ride we had that summer
Before we knew it we were on our 2nd glass of wine
Sittin' there talkin' just like
We had never said goodbye
Well even after all that time well it clicked just like before
Maybe a little more
Before we knew it they were closing up the joint
Yea, stackin' them chairs
Lockin' them doors
I asked the waitress would she mind if we slept there
And stayed for breakfast
We both laughed
You grabbed your purse
I paid our tab
Standing underneath the moon
I couldn't help but ask
What you say we take a stroll down by the river
What a night, girl can you believe this weather
I been thinking we were pretty damn good together
You said yea wonder why did we ever let it go
I said I don't know but after seeing you tonight
Well It feels just like
We had never said goodbye
Never said goodbye
I been thinking maybe we should give it one more try
Like we never said good byeOh you told me you had found another that I no longer fit into your plans
Don't apologize I said for it don't matter but you know what a liar I am
With a smile on my face I wished you well dear
With the happiness at last you say you've found
But if you knew how I've tossed and I've tumbled then you'd know what a liar I am
[ steel ]
I watched you walk away with your new love
Watched my dream world tumble to the ground
I told all of our friends I'm glad it's over but they know what a liar I am
With a smile on my face...
Now you know what a liar I amHere comes more tears to cry
Here comes more heartaches by
Here comes my baby, back again
Here comes more misery
Here comes old memories
Here comes my baby, back again
My arms are open wide to let more hurt inside
Here comes my baby back again
He's sorry once again, once more I'll understand
Here comes my baby, back again
My arms are open wide to let more hurt inside
Here comes my baby, back again
He's sorry once again, once more I'll understand
Here comes my baby, back again
Here comes my baby, back again
(Here comes my baby)You always hurt the one you love the one you shouldn't turn at all
You always take the sweetest rose and crash it till the petals fall
You always break the kindest heart with hasty words you can't recall
So if I broke your heart last night it's because I love you most of all
You always break the kindest heartMaking believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
I'll always dream, still I'll never own you
Making believe, its all I can do
Can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe that I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believe
Making believe that I never lost you
But my happy hours are fun and so few
My plans for the future will never come true
Making believe what else can I do
Can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe that I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believeI'm standing by the street lights of the city wondering which way I should go
You're to my right she's to my left and I'm like a smoke ring that blows
Which a way which a way which a way do I go
I know if I should turn to my right hand I'll break a heart and a home
But if I should turn to my left hand I'll break nobody's heart but my own
Which a way which a way which a way do I go
[ guitar ]
My life is like the streets of the city dark deserted and alone
My heart can't reach that decision and I'm caught between right and wrong
Which a way which a way which a way do I goA showman's life is a smokey bar
And the fevered chase of a tiny star
It's a hotel room and a lonely wife
From what I've seen of a showman's life
Nobody told me about this part
They told me all about the pretty girls
And the wine and the money and the good times
There's no mention of all the wear and tear
On an old honky tonker's heart
Well I might have known it
But nobody told me about this part
A boy will dream, as children do
Of a Great White Way, until the dream comes true
And a phony smile in a colored light
Is all there is to a showman's life
Nobody told me about this part
They told me all about the pretty girls
And the wine and the money and the good times
There's no mention of all the wear and tear
On an old honky tonker's heart
Well I might have known it
But nobody told me about this part
And nobody told me about this part
They told me all about the pretty girls
And the wine and the money and the good times
There's no mention of, all the wear and tear
On an old honky tonker's heart
Well I might have known it
But nobody told me about this part
Well I might have known it
Nobody told me about this part-Girl
Waking up with you makes me feel alive.(oh)
And every kiss you give still takes me by surprise
So I thought that I would tell the world today
My life has changed so ill say
-Chorus
You are not a stranger. Youre not just friend
You are not just lover who is sleeping in my bed
You are what I came for, always thinking of
you are everything I wanted and love
-Boy
You wash me with you eyes
You give me all your time
Someone I cant forget and I always dreamed Id find
So I thought id tell the world today
All because of you ill never be the same
Chorus Repeats
-Girls
So many times I told you so
I guess I wanted you to know.
Chorus Repeats
Wanted and loveThe way your mind works
Drivin' so fast, carving your way
Through the city
Well, you can't tell me
You get what you want
You've figured it out
And you're just fine
'cause you're talking to yourself
You don't hear a thing
And all history unfolds before you
But you shut your eyes
But you shut your eyes
It's not happening
We all grew up and
We fend for ourselves
And we fend for each other
We fend for each other sometimes
But you keep on racin' and runnin'
Like something is chasing you
Like something's gonna get you
Well, something's gonna get you one day
You're talking to yourself
You don't hear a thing
And all history unfolds before you
But you shut your eyes
But you shut your eyes
It's not happening
And you're talking to yourself
Don't hear a thing
And all history unfolds before you
But you shut your eyes
But you shut your eyes
It's not happening
But you shut your eyes
But you shut your eyes
It's not happening, oh, no, noEverybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set set me free oh lonesome me
A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool is blind and just can't see oh lonesome me
I'll bet she's not like me she's out and fancy free
She's flirtin' with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms
Well there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I've thought of everything from A to Z oh lonesome me
Well I'll bet she's not like me...
Oh lonesome me oh lonesome meHollis Dixon and the Keynotes
Playing the Fraternities
I was on drums I didn't play so hot
But I kept a damn good beat
We played a lot of rock n' roll
and some breezy rhythm and blues
That was down in Tuscaloosa 1962
But the Bear and his boys were tearing it up
Every Saturday Afternoon
Saturday night we get all torn down
In the fraternity living rooms
The kids got right, the band got tight
When we laid down that funky groove
That was down in Tuscaloosa 1962
And it was Rollllll Tide all night long
The kids would scream and shout
That was their favorite song
And it was Rolllll Tide all night long
The Kids would scream and shout
That was their favorite song
Some time Dan Penn and the Pallbearers
Were next door doing a show
The gig was over we would all pack up
head on back to Muscle Shoals
but before we left town we would hang around
that local Chat n' Chew
That was down in Tuscaloosa 1962
That was down in Tuscaloosa 1962It's been one of those days I can do no right
I can't win for losing try as I might
Yeah I feel walked on like an old doormat
And Lord I hate feeling like that
And though my best laid plans took a slight detour
It ain't just nothing a little love won't cure
Ain't nothing around me tight can't turn around and make all right
So shut that crazy world outside love me back to life tonight
The big dogs are winning that old rat race
I'm licking my wounds here in second place
That boss I got don't cut no slack
He's got a permanent place here on my back
They've been dishing it out but I will endure
It ain't nothing just a little love won't cure
Ain't nothing around me tight
It's been one of these days I should've stayed in bed
I've been gettin' my brains worn out instead
I took it on the chin I took their best shot
But I'll be alright when I'm punching that clock
Cause when I'm back in your arms one thing's for sure
There ain't nothing a little love won't cure
Ain't nothing around me tight,
Nothing just a little love won't cure
Nothing just a little love won't cureIf it hadn't been for Cotton Eyed Joe I'd been married a long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
Where did you come from Cotton Eyed Joe
If it hadn't been for Cotton Eyed Joe I'd been married a long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
Where did you come from Cotton Eyed Joe
Rode into town and made me believe he's spent half his life just a lookin' for me
I thought he loved me but boy I was wrong cause he had his fun and we were over and done
If it hadn't been for Cotton Eyed Joe I'd been married a long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
Where did you come from Cotton Eyed Joe
If it hadn't been for Cotton Eyed Joe I'd been married a long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
Where did you come from Cotton Eyed Joe
I know you think he's heaven sent but he'll leave your heart all broken and bent
Trust me when I tell you to leave him alone cause nothing good ever came from Cotton Eyed Joe
If it hadn't been for Cotton Eyed Joe I'd been married a long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
Where did you come from Cotton Eyed Joe
Keep on dancin' I'll tell you the tale about a tall, dark thing with eyes so blue
With a lookty look to every girl in town giving the other man just another rebound
I heard the story but it couldn't be true till he rode through here back in '02
He broke my heart and stole my soul makin' me another victim of Cotton Eyed Joe
If it hadn't been for Cotton Eyed Joe I'd been married a long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
Where did you come from Cotton Eyed Joe
If it hadn't been for Cotton Eyed Joe I'd been married a long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
Where did you come from Cotton Eyed Joe
Cotton Eyed Joe where did you go
Cotton Eyed Joe
Cotton Eyed JoeSome may say, that an empty-handed man
Will do all he can to hold someone again
But I say to hell with it all
Till there ain't nothin' left to condemn
And like the wind guides the sailor
I raise up the anchor, and drift
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
Break down the wall that I lean upon
I'm movin' on
By the wayside, far away from you
Where I thought time would heal
Faster than I could feel blue
And I find myself at a bitter, wounded road
Where in all of its glory is a story
That's best left untold
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
Break down the wall that I leaned upon
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
Break down the wall that I leaned upon
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
Face a new dawn, sing a new song
I'm movin' onEvery time I look into your eyes
I want to say that, I apologize
I can't change, I thought you knew
I'm not the one to stay with you
You don't need a crazy love like mine
That comes and goes from time to time
So, save your heart and save your dreams
Forget about me
A girl like you deserves the best
Believe me babe, it's in your interest
Forget about me, forget about me
Forget about the way we used to touch
Forget about the times we cared so much
Forget about the way our days would end
And all the nights that we would share again
You're old enough to realize
You got to keep your love alive
When you hear the music let it play
Don't let your feelings hide away
Let your love run wild and free
Throw away my memory
You can erase it, you can replace it
Forget about me
A girl like you deserves the best
Believe me babe, it's in your interest
Forget about me, forget about me
Forget about the way we used to touch
Forget about the times we cared so much
Forget about the way our days would end
And all the nights that we would share again
Forget about me
Ooh, forget about meMy last breath, I wanna take with a smile
And no regrets, no hope of turning back that dial
Let the story I've written be something worth leaving, we're leaving behind
When I'm gone, tell them I laughed more than I shed tears
When I'm gone, tell them I stared down all my fears
That I danced on a wire, and I walked through a fire
That I lived every moment 'til that moment retired
So my life goes on, goes on when I'm gone
Oh, oh
When I'm Gone
Tell him I left that town, but it never left my soul
That I settled down, but I never got old
If the house was packed and we all raised a glass as the credits rolled
When I'm gone, tell them I laughed more than I shed tears
When I'm gone, tell them I stared down all my fears
That I danced on a wire, and I walked through a fire
That I lived every moment 'til that moment retired
So my life goes on, goes on when I'm gone
Time don't last forever
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Time don't last forever
Oh oh oh
When I'm gone (when I'm gone)
Did my life go on, go on, go on?
When I'm gone, tell them I laughed more than I shed tears
When I'm gone, tell them I stared down all my fears
That I danced on a wire, and I walked through a fire
That I lived every moment 'til that moment retired
So my life goes on, goes on
When I'm gone
When I'm gone
Oh, my last breath I wanna take with a smile
Oh oh oh when I'm gone
Oh oh oh when I'm gone
Oh oh oh when I'm gone
Oh oh oh when I'm goneI'd wish you'd scream
Just say anything
Curse my name, slam the door
There's a stranger where you stood before
And he looks at me
Like I'm not there
I'm floating here in the atmosphere
And you don't care
Knock knock
Lights come on but nobody's home
I talk
But you've turned off some time ago
So we spin like a broken record and your unavailability
Is killing me
No vacancy
Everytime I knock knock
So roll away
That heart of stone
It's turned you cold
You're hard to hold
When you're up in your head
It's about to get
Like we never met
We walk around this ghost town
Just like the living dead
Can you hear me
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me
Beating on the door of your heart
The door of your heartShe comes on like a beautiful lie
Is it a star or a satellite
Is she real or just in my mind
I can't take it
Oh I head her voice
I'm seeing things
I swear I've gone crazy
I feel her like an echo, echo, echo
Rollin' like a rip tide
When I think I'm alright
She won't let go, let go, let go
She keeps holding on, holding on
She comes around back again
Disappears like the wind blows
Like an echo, echo, echo
Thought I would be find
I wouldn't be found
Thought I could get lost in this little town
But there's no place to hide from the sound
Of her saying "baby"
Oh I hear her voice
I'm seeing things
Everybody says I've gone crazy
I feel her like an echo, echo, echo
Rollin' like a rip tide
When I think I'm alright
She won't let go, let go, let go
She keeps holding on, holding on
She comes around back again
Disappears like the wind blows
Like an echo, echo, echo
Yeah I should've run her down when I had a chance
Tell her baby sorry for the things I did
I'd be drowning in her moonlight silhouette
Not this
Echo (echo)
Echo (echo)
Echo, echo, echo
Rollin' like a rip tide
When I think I'm alright
She won't let go, let go, let go
She keeps holding on, holding on
She comes around back again
Disappears like the wind blows
Like an echo, echo, echoIF IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU
(Kenny O'Dell - Larry Henley)
'71 House Of Gold Music
If it's all right with you I'd like to stay here and love you
And hold you at least until the daylight comes
And if it's all right with you I'd like to think that when tomorrow comes
It'll be way too soon if it's all right with you
If it's all right with you I think I'll love you
If it's all right with you I think I'll love you
When the morning sun arrives then we'll decide if I should stay or go
If it's all right with you we won't think about tomorrow
Or yesterday tonight could be a lifetime
And if it's all right with you I'll dim the light and close the world away
Oh I really wanna stay if it's all right with you
If it's all right with you...I picked last night in Tucson I sang 'em a country song
Missed my plane this morning Lord cause we parted all night long
I'm out here now usin' my thumb tryin' to make it to El Paso
Cause tonight I play at the cabarete they done told it on the radio
To a country singer it's a lonesome road with time hangin' heavy on my hands
If I take a little pleasure and a little bit of love baby that don't makes me all bad
I've been high and I've been low and I've been to San Antone
But the worst by far than I've ever been was when I've been alone
Tomorrow night I'm in Austin I've got some old friends there
Cause there's old Jeff and Willie and Sam and a girl with the long dark hair
To a country singer...
There's one last stop down in Shreveport on this tour of one night stands
And I've got some time but no peace of mind till I'm back on the road again
If my old guitar had learned to talk it'll tell about the things I done
There's a mighty good woman back in big D but never ever let me come home
To a country singer...
If I take a little pleasure and a little bit of love baby that don't makes me all badThe volume knob
It's a little tricky
Sometimes, it gets a little sticky
From your lip gloss
I'd like to rub off
You're pretty pink painted finger tips
1 and 2 are preset to country
3 and 4, well, that gets it bumpin'
We got some Willie
We got some Nelly
Find you one you like, girl
And give it a spin
And play it again
With your ray ban sunglasses
And my braves hat
Turned backwards
Got you winkin' at me
Baby, it's your show
I'm drivers side
VIP, a front row
Keep turnin' it up
And turnin' me on
You're a rock star girl
I'm singin' along
It's like you know what you're doing to me
Every time you press play
Yeah, you've got me fallin' in love
My little Chevrolet DJ
Nights like these
Are made off the highway
Stealin' kisses as another song fades
Wakin' up
Callin' you up tomorrow
Sayin', baby, hit replay
I'm already missin' your face
With your ray ban sunglasses
And my braves hat
Turned backwards
Got you winkin' at me
Baby, it's your show
I'm drivers side
VIP, a front row
Keep turnin' it up
And turnin' me on
You're a rock star girl
I'm singin' along
It's like you know what you're doing to me
Every time you press play
Yeah, you've got me fallin' in love
My little Chevrolet DJI bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you let it be me
Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Oh without your sweet love
What would life be?
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you always let it be me
If for each bit of gladness
Someone must taste of sadness
I'll bear the sorrow let it be me
No matter how the price is
I'll make the sacrifices
Through each tomorrow let it be me
To you I'm praying
Hear what I'm saying
Please let your heart beat for me, just me
And never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you always let it be me
Now and for always let it be meToday I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again
What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I've cried
I guess I should have known the worst was yet to come
And the crying time for me had just begun
Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again
Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you againTime has passed and things have changed
You've gone your way I've gone mine
On the surface it's all over but beneath the surface
You're still on my mind
'Cause you're still the only one I'll ever love
Forget the hours forget the miles
Your lips are still the lips I'm dreaming of
And you're still the only one I'll ever love
All my thoughts of you are good ones
Happy hours that just flew by
You were always someone special
And you'll be my someone special till I die
And you're still the only one I'll ever love
Treasured memories of treasured times
Your lips are still the lips I'm dreaming of
And you're still the only one I'll ever loveOh the sisters of mercy
They are not departed or gone
They were waiting for me
When I thought that I just can't go on
And they brought me their comfort
And later they brought me this song
Oh I hope you run into them
You who've been traveling so long
Yes, you who must leave everything
That you cannot control
It begins with your family
But soon it comes 'round to your soul
Well I've been where you're hanging
And I think I can see how you're pinned
When you're not feeling holy
Your loneliness says that you've sinned
Well they lay down beside me
I make my confessions to them
They touched both my eyes
And I touched the dew on their hem
If your life is a leaf
That the seasons tear off and condemn
They will bind you with love
That is graceful and green as a stem
When I left they were sleeping
And I hope you run into them soon
Don't turn on the lights
You can read their address by the moon
And you won't make me jealous
If I find they have sweetened your night
We weren't lovers like that
And besides it would still be all right
We weren't lovers like that
And besides it would still be all rightDear heart I wish you were here to warm this night
And dear heart it seems like a year since you've been out of my sight
A single room a table for one it's a lonesome town alright
But soon I'll kiss you hello at our front door
And dear heart I want you to know I'll leave your arms never more
A single room a table for oneEverybody's gone away,
Said they're movin' to L.A.
There's not a soul I know around,
Everybody's leavin' town
Some caught a freight, some caught a plane
Find the sunshine leave the rain
They said this town will waste your time
Guess they're right ---- it's wasting mine
[Chorus:]
Some gotta win, some gotta lose
Good Time Charlie's got the blues
Good Time Charlie's got the blues
why'know my heart keeps tellin' me
You're not a kid at 33
why'play around why'lose your wife,
why'play too long, you lose your life
Got my pills t'ease the pain,
Can't find a thing to stop the rain
I'd love t'try and settle down,
But everybody's leavin' town
ChorusHere's my keys, I want you to take 'em
I think I'm gonna need you to get back home
Hold on to my hat, I don't wanna lose it
I couldn't stand for something else to be gone
I'm sure you know the reason I'm here cryin'
I think you'll understand why
[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm the designated drinker
I just lost the one that wrapped me around her finger
I need to get to where I can't think of her
So tonight, I'm the designated drinker
I came here to get you to help me
I need a friend to see me through
I hated to call, I knew you wouldn't mind at all
I know you know I'd do the same for you
I'm not the kind that likes to drown my sorrow
I may hate myself tomorrow
Oh but
[Chorus]When I received your letter, you were down and out, you say
At first I thought I would tell you, just to travel on the other way
But in my memory lingers, all you once were to me
And I'm going to give you another chance to prove what you can be
Any old time, you want to come back home
Just write me a line and say no more you'll roam
You'll have your chance to play the game fair
When you left me, sweetheart, you only left a load of care
Now that you're down, I'm going to stick by you
If you'll only say that your roaming days are through
You'll find me here like the day you left me alone
Any old time, you want to come back home
Now that you're down, I'm going to stick by you
If you'll only say that your roaming days are through
And you'll find me here like the day you left me alone
Any old time, you want to come back homeThe phone broke the silence
Like the screaming of the siren
and I just sat beside it
took another drag on my cigarette
swore I'd never smoke again
and I watched the rain.
Well I knew that it was you
calling just to prove that
you were as strong as you could be
and you could get along without me anytime
and anyway
CHORUS:
So I just stared though the door screen and I
watched the cars come down the pike
their lights against the sky
like a drive in movie on a country road
that I've seen before
Never like the first time
Blue lights on the dashboard
songs on the radio
oh and how are you to ever know
how much I loved you so you thought that I
was only dreaming
What a suprise it must have been
to realise I was one of them
not a game with just the men
not an angel only a friend
and not someone that you could believe in
*CHORUS*
and out across the rugged hills
the dust blows the wind wails
sunbleached skulls and empty shells
broken men with tales to tell
and I would be one of them.
And how are you to ever know
how far it was gonna go
you fall in love and that's the road
you travel till you can't no more
and then we just we turn around again
*CHORUS*Jingle bell, jingle bell
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bell swing
And jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin'
Up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in
Jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin'
In jingle bell square
In the frosty air
What a bright time
It's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell, time
Is a swell time
To go glidin' in a
one horse sleigh
Giddy-up, jingle horse
Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle
In a jinglin' beat
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock(bat mcgrath/michael jones/anthony little)
Don't tell me that it's over because I know my heart won't hear
It thinks we'll be together like we've been for all these years
I know this may sound foolish, but you've got to realize
I'd rather be a fool than to say good-bye
I'd rather take my chances that I'll get one more try
I'd rather live a lie than to face the truth
Before I'd love somebody new, I'd rather miss you
I can't imagine life without you
I close my eyes and see your face
You say I'll find another, but who could ever take your place
So I'll keep on believing my love will change your mind
I'd rather be a fool than to say good-bye
I'd rather take my chances that I'll get one more try
I'd rather live a lie than to face the truth
Before I love somebody new, I'd rather miss you
I'd rather be a fool than to say good-bye
I'd rather take my chances that I'll get one more try
I'd rather live a lie than to face the truth
Before I love somebody new, I'd rather miss youI'll make believe
That the sight of her in my head's seldom seen
And then insist
That I can't still taste the inside of her kiss
With luck in time
I might even fool myself with both those lies
Till there's no need
I'll make believe
I'll just pretend
That she really never left me in the end
And all night long
Swear right up and down round here, there's nothin' wrong
With work my mind
Could cause the truth to get lost or hard to find
But until then
I'll just pretend
Oh, how I wish you could've seen her
Come crawlin' back a beggin' me
'Cause if you had, I wouldn't need her
Like I do so desperately
I'll just pretend
That she really never left me in the end
And all night long
Swear right up and down 'round here, there's nothing wrong
With work my mind
Could cause the truth to get lost or hard to find
But until then
I'll just pretendHello little bluebird I know how you feel
One time I thought I'd never learn too
But someone came along and helped me like I'm helping you
And if I can fly I'll bet you can too
I don't know what misfortune kept you down this time
But there's usually a reason for it all
You'll run into things that hurt you all the time
And the higher up the harder that you fall
First thing you have to do is be sure you wanna fly
Cause no one in the world can do it for you
Then practice what you learn by doin' all that you can do
Cause if I can fly I'll bet you can too
I don't know what misfortune...
So go spread your little bluebird wings and fly away
May the melodies of love always be with you
And someday you'll help someone remember what I'm telling you
If I can fly I'll bet you can too
La la da da la la la la if I can fly I'll bet you can too
(La la da da la la la la) if I can fly I'll bet you can too
(La la da da la la la la) if I can fly I'll bet you can too
(La la da da la la la la) if I can fly I'll bet you can tooYesterday the odds were stacked
In favor of my expectations
Flyin' above the rest,
Never fallin' from the nest
Tuesday came and went
And now I'm in a little situation
Maybe it's for the best
I can live alone, I guess
[Chorus]
Maybe I can stand alone
Maybe I'm strong as stone
Even though the bird has flown
Maybe he'll fly on home
Forgive me if I'm keeping you apart
From better conversation
I'm hung up on all my doubt
Trying to sort the whole thing out
Tell me that I'm smart enough
To deal with all the information
Spinning inside my head
Every word he ever said
[Chorus: x2]Don't rock the jukebox
I want to hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Before you drop that quarter
Keep one thing in mind
You got a heart-broke hillbilly
Standing here in line
I've been down and lonely
Ever since she left
Before you punch that number
Could I make one request
Don't rock the jukebox
I want to hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
I ain't got nothin'
Against rock and roll
But when your heart's been broken
You need a song that's slow
There ain't nothin' like a steel guitar
To drown a memory
Before you spend your money baby
Play a song for me
Don't rock the jukebox
I want to hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Yeah, don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song.Don't look at me with love in your eyes
Go look at somebody that can make it worthwhile
I'm hurt from a love affair I didn't want in
I'm in no condition to try to love again
Don't smile at me because it's no use
'Cause I don't have a smile that I can give to you
Someday, you might look me up, but let me be till then
For I'm in no condition to try to love again
I'm in no condition to try to love again
Man I love just broke my heart
And it must have time to mend
He have me the breeze
Now he's gone with the wind
I'm in no condition to try to love again
I'm in no condition to try to love again
Man I love just broke my heart
And it must have time to mend
He have me the breeze
Now he's gone with the wind
I'm in no condition to try to love againGonna find a perfect mountain gonna stay until I die
Drink of mother nature's fountain let my worries roll on by
Well the good times go easy and the bad times go slow
Even in the in-between times I can't let my worries go
Always wanting to go somewhere but I never fail to find
I grow tired of what I find there long for things I left behind
Gonna find a perfect mountain
Well I can think of nothing better than a sweetheart for a friend
Before I find the two together I'm afraid my days shall end
Always wanting to go somewhere but I never fail to find
I grow tired of what I find there long for things I left behind
Gonna find a perfect mountain
Let my worries roll on byIt's better than sipping something strong
The way my name rolls off your tongue
The way the light it hits your eyes
And makes me come alive
It moves me more than any song
When you've got that shade of lipstick on
Across the room or by my side
Baby I can feel my heartbeat, heartbeat
Pounding my chest, you in that dress
Making it jump like a kick drum on repeat
I love the way you make my heart beat, heartbeat
There's no mistaking right now it's racing
Every time that you get close to me
Baby I can feel my heartbeat
You make me feel like I could fly
Like some old roller coaster ride
The way you flip your hair
Well girl it gets me every time
You drive me that perfect kind of crazy
Baby I can feel my heartbeat, heartbeat
Pounding my chest, you in that dress
Making it jump like a kick drum on repeat
I love the way you make my heart beat, heartbeat
There's no mistaking right now it's racing
Every time that you get close to me
Baby I can feel my heartbeatI had it tough when I was just a little kid
It didn't matter what I thought it didn't matter what I did
I felt the doubt for what I lacked right from the start
It did a number on my head but it could never touch my heart
'Cause I had just enough imagination
Just enough to keep the faith
That somehow I would think of what to do
When I'd get lost in a momentary weakness of emotion
All the angels came along to help me through
Life pulls fast changes
Wind blows past pages
All I see is, I don't need this
Highstrung tight rope walks
Ticking time bomb clocks
Scratch my name off, cut these chains
[Chorus]
I'm free...Kicking out of that prison
I'm free...Singing those words of wisdom
Let it be...Nobody's gonna put the blues inside of me..
And in the stress to be the best I've done it all
I've slammed the doors I've jammed the locks
Laid the bricks, I've built the walls
No one could tell me back then why joy eluded me
Kept bumping into that misery locked up deep down inside of me
Took that rage and I
Turned that page and I
Packed my tools, went back to school
And I've passed my graduation
I hold my Ph. D. in crash test blues
I've paid those dues
I'm free...
[Chorus]
Time flied by in photographs
And paper scraps and songs
Here I stand in ruby slippers
Three taps takes me home... I'm free...I heard the bells on Christmas Day their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat of peace on earth goodwill to men
I thought as now this day had come the belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song of peace on earth goodwill to men
And in despair I bowed my head there is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong and mocks the song of peace on earth goodwill to men
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep God is not dead nor doth he sleeps
The wrong shall fail the right prevail with peace on earth goodwill to menHere making each day of the year
Changing my life with one wave of his hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
Running my hands through his hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking
But he doesn't know she's there
I want him everywhere
And if he's beside me I know I need never care
But to love him is to meet him
Everywhere knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching his eyes and hoping I'm always there
To be there and everywhere here there and everywhere
I want him everywhere
And if he's beside me I know I need never care
Oh but to love him is to meet him everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching his eyes and hoping I'm always there
To be there and everywhere here there and everywhereShortcut to part of Bill Monroe Lyrics

Full Bill Monroe Lyrics...Oh, it's crying time again you're gonna leave me
I can see that faraway look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you held me darling
That it won't be long before it's crying time
Oh, they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
Well, my love for you could never grow no stronger
If I live to be a hundred years old
Oh, it's crying time again you're gonna leave me
Oh, they say that you found someone that you love better
That's the way it's happened every time before
And as sure as sun comes up tomorrow
Crying time will start when you walk out the doorThere's some things that I regret
Some words I wish had gone unsaid
Some starts
That had some better endings
Been some bad times I've been through
Damage I cannot undo
Some things
I wish I could do all all over again
But it don't really matter
Life gets that much harder
It makes you that much stronger
Oh, some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned
And every tear that had to fall from my eyes
Everyday I wonder how I get through the night
Every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every time
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned
There's mistakes that I have made
Some chances I just threw away
Some roads
I never should've taken
Been some signs I didn't see
Hearts that I hurt needlessly
Some wounds
That I wish I had one more chance to mend
But it don't make no difference
The past can't be rewritten
You get the life you're given
Oh, some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned
And every tear that had to fall from my eyes
Everyday I wonder how I get through the night
Every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every time
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned
And all the things that break you
All the things that make you strong
You can't change the past
'Cause it's gone
And nothing's gotta go
Because they are gone
Lessons learned
And every tear that had to fall from my eyes
Everyday I wonder how I get through the night
Every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every time
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned
Oh, some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned
Lessons learnedI'll step aside for you if you don't want me I'll step aside for you if you don't care
I'm not the one to cling to a broken promise
I'll step aside for for someone else somewhere
I'll step aside for you if you don't want me I'll step aside for you and you alone
And when I'm gone just promise you'll remember
That I was once your darling all you own
Before you go please answer this last question
As you gave them too much tear dimmed eyes
Cannot be true you never cared about me
And all those words I treasured were just liesAs I looked at the valleys down below
They were green just as far as I could see.
As my memory returned, oh how my heart did yearn
for you and the day that used to be.
(Chorus)
High on a mountain oh, wind blowin' free
Thinking about the days that used to be.
High on a mountain oh, standin' all alone
Wondering where the years of my life has flown.
Oh I wonder if you ever think of me
or if time has blotted out your memory.
As I listen to the breeze, whisper gently through the trees
I'll always cherish what you meant to me.I'm a low down soul
Out in a lonesome land
Just a low down soul
Out in a lonesome land
I can't find anyone
To lend a helping hand
I tried so hard
But it's all in vain
I tried so hard
But it's all in vain
Every dream I have
Always ends the same
I don't know what to do
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to do
I don't know where to go
You are all I want
You are all I know
Yeah I'm a low down soul
Out in a lonesome land
Just a low down soul
Out in a lonesome land
I can't find anyone
To lend a helping handCasanova broke ya
Just like china
He was smooth as southern Blue Bell Cream
?Cept he never meant to share that diamond ring
So you take up to the roof-top, pining
Aim to touch the moon a' golden white
Lord, the air is damp, the stars are teary eyed
Here?s a little secret, love
Everybody comes undone
Here?s a dirty secret Darlin?
Everyone
From the ballroom you can hear them laughing
Pretty maidens and your own Don Jaun
And ya tell yourself
They?ll miss you when you?re gone
Here?s a little secret, love
Everybody comes undone
Here?s a dirty secret Darlin?
Everyone
Cross yourself, by Jesus
Now your head is all a blur
Questions don?t come easier
Answers, they get longer
Here?s a little secret, love
Everybody comes undone
Here?s a dirty secret Darlin?
Everyone
Here?s a little secret, love
Everybody comes undone
Here?s a dirty secret Darlin?
EveryoneIf I, could be with you forever
My restles heart
Would never want to roam
I've never been loved
The way you love me
[Chorus]
I wish I felt this way at home
When you kiss me
It's words without speaking
And I don't believe that
God would call this wrong
Your arms are the refuge
I was seeking
[Chorus]
But I don't, and I won't
We did all that we could
He and I
We tried hard
But it's just no good
I may never be free
'Cause I've no reason
And I don't expect you to wait that long
But I'll say one more time
As I'm leavin'
[Chorus]
Yes, I wish I felt this way at homeGot a guitar
Got a guitar on my back
And I'm standin' on this lonesome railroad track
Train's a-comin'
It'll be here 'fore too long
But I don't think I can stop it with a song
Girl, that's the kind of way I'm feelin'
Tryin' to stop your leavin'
Got a pebble
Got a pebble in my hand
And I toss it out into the middle of the Rio Grande
But the river keeps runnin'
Don't even know that I'm around
I could throw a million more and not slow it down
Girl, that's kind of the way I'm feelin'
Tryin' to stop your leavin'
There's nothin' that I wouldn't try
If I thought it would change your mind
But you don't love me
No, you don't love me anymore
And I know as soon as you walk out that door
Train's a comin', river's runnin'
Train's a comin', river's runnin'
Pain's a comin', tears are runnin'
Yeah, that's kind of the way I'm feelin'
Knowin' I couldn't stop your leavin'Hold on honey, there's a new dawn coming
and a big bird to sweep you away
Are you born yet? Are you listening?
Are you sick of staring at the walls?
Are you hungry? Are you angry?
Are you wondering if there's anyone at all?
Hold on honey there's a new dawn coming
and a big bird to sweep you away
Keep on dreaming soon there'll be a reason
to see it through one more day
Are you weary? Are you sinking?
Are you tired of holding up the walls?
Are you done with all your thinking?
Have you found that there's no one at all?
Hold on honey there's a new dawn coming
and a big bird to sweep you away
Keep on dreaming soon there'll be a reason
to see it through one more day
Ain't got no answers here
What I see is not clear
Time to shake it around
Turn my world upside down
and watch as the stars come unhinged
Hold on honey there's a new dawn coming
and a big bird to sweep you away
Keep on dreaming soon there'll be a reason
to see it through one more day
Hold on honey there's a new dawn coming
and a big bird to sweep us away
Keep on dreaming soon there'll be a reason
to see it through one more day
Are you born yet?
Are you born yet?Baby drop what you're doin'
Let's jump off this merry-go-round
And I don't know if we're comin' or goin'
Same old, same old, bringin' me down
I've had it up to here with this rat race
We're just wastin' time, not tastin' life
I'd rather be
Sittin' on the beach watchin' the sun come up
Runnin' my fingers through your hair as you lay there all curled up
Lookin' at me with that give me one more kiss
Love doesn't get any better than this look on your face
I'd reach down and pull you up and we head that sailboat out to sea
Chart our course for anywhere the wind blows, any place we see
Our sails anchorin' down lovin' the night away
Waitin' on the light of another perfect day
Want a little sand between my toes
The sunshine on your face
And today's the perfect day
We should be
Sittin' on the beach watchin' the sun come up
Runnin' my fingers through your hair as you lay there all curled up
Lookin' at me with that give me one more kiss
Love doesn't get any better than this look on your face
I'd reach down and pull you up and we head that sailboat out to sea
Chart our course for anywhere the wind blows, any place we see
Our sails anchorin' down lovin' the night away
Waitin' on the light of another perfect day
Lovin' the night away
Waitin' on the light of another perfect dayMy mother sang the sweetest melody
Although she never sang in a musical key
I'd hear her through the house
My name called out loud
My mother sang the sweetest melody
My mother's hands were always cool and soft
And like her eyes they would caress with every touch
She would listen to my chatter
As if every word I spoke mattered
She'd hold me close and whisper in my ear
She'd say, "girl you are a part of me
I have made you strong
When you grow up and are on your own
Remember to win them with your song"
My father sang in perfect harmony
And though he never sang in a musical key
You could hear him when he'd enter the house
The kiss he'd give my Ma
My father sang in perfect harmony
My father's words were always sure and clear
And like his presence they would rid me of my fears
When I crawled up on his knees
I was safe as I could be
He'd hold me tight and whisper in my ear
He'd say, "girl you are a part of me
I have made you strong
When you grow up and are on your own
Remember to win them with your song"
My mother sang in perfect harmony
Although she never sang in a musical keyI Believe And I Receive

I Am Free I Am Free Yeah
Yeah I'm Free So FreeYou left me and you went away
You said that you'd be back in just a day
You've broken your promise and you've left me here alone
I don't know why you did dear but I do know that you're gone
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
Now darling, you know I love you well
Love you more than I can ever tell
I thought that you wanted me and always would be mine
But you went and left me here with troubles on my mind
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
Now someday you may be lonesome to
Walking the floor is good for you
Just keep right on walking and it won't hurt you to cry
Remember that I love you and I will the day I die
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over youThere's an old tear stained, worn King James
Bible on my lap
I can hear mama now say it won't let you down
And it never has
So I turn to the Psalms straight to the one
That I can quote by heart
But the words that used to comfort me are tearing me apart
[Chorus]
He leaded me through death's dark valley
And by still waters too
Surely goodness and his mercy
Are gonna pull me through
But tonight I've wrestled wit the devil
Wrestled with the truth
If the lord is my shepherd
And I shall not want
Why do I still want you
All my friends say this will end
You're not the one for me
Cause I'm the kind that loves for life
And your the kind that leaves
So I've been praying and I've been waiting
For some kind of peace
But you haven't phoned and I'm leaning on Old Psalms twenty-three
[Chorus]Baby, we're sitting on top of the world
We can fly on the wings of an eagle
Take a ride on a rocket ship
Drink to the bottom of a bottle
But we can't get any higher than this
We could tiptoe up to the mountaintop
Snuggle and cuddle and a kiss
But sooner or later we gotta come down
We can't, no, we can't
Yeah, we can't get any higher than this
Baby, we're sittin' on top of the world
And we can't get any higher than this
If the sky is the limit
There's no telling how far we'll go
Even the angels are grinning
If there's a heaven we're right in the middle of it
If this ain't stoned on loving
Oh, then I don't know what is
Cloud nine is right below us
And we can't get any higher than this
We can't, no, we can't
Yeah, we can't get any higher than this
Baby, we're sittin' on top of the world
And we can't get any higher than this
If the sky is the limit
There's no telling how far we'll go
Even the angels are grinning
If there's a heaven we're right in the middle of it
If this ain't stoned on loving
Oh, then I don't know what is
Cloud nine is right below us
And we can't get any higher than this
We can't, no, we can't
We can't get any higher than this
Baby, we're sittin' on top of the world
And we can't get any higher
No, we can't get any high
We can't, no, we can't
We can't get any higher than this
Baby, we're sittin' on top of the world
And we can't get any higher than this
I said, baby, we are sittin' on top of the world
We can't get any higher than thisI rolled off the Frisco mint in 1909
The last one they ever made, you should've seen me shine
When I landed on the counter they gave me to a kid
Making change for a jaw breaker was the first thing that I did
I got traded for a pocket knife, two marbles and some string
Wound up on a railroad track waiting for a train
Snatched up by a hobo and turned right into wine
Pitched up against the wall at least a thousand times
Round and round a penny goes
Round and back again
Listen and I'll tell you
The places that I've been
I was stolen from a banker by Pretty Boy Floyd and then
He gave me to a farmer who was trying to save his land
I was good luck to a soldier back in world war two
He lost me in a poker game the day the war was through
I got stuck behind the back seat of a '51 Chevrolet
Spare change in the sixties, getting worthless every day
Not it's piggy banks and gum machines and occasional wishing wells
Or laying on a bar room floor
As far and wide
So both of us can dare
A promise I will love and bide
That's all I have to share
A chance to sail among the stars
That few will ever see
To feel the deepest missing you
That most think cannot be
A heart that beats for only one
And loves you fast and true
A promise I will love and bide
That's all I have for you
These things I have to give to you
Their value isn't much
Just things that you can barely see
And rarely ever touch
A hand to hold when we're alone
And no one seems to care
A gentle touch to reassure
And tell you I'm still there
To try my best to reminisce
Our dreams that all come true
A promise I will love and bide
That's all I have for you
My promise I will love and bide
This I give to youI grew up a-dreamin' of bein' a cowboy
Lovin' the cowboy ways
Pursuin' the life of my high-ridin' heroes
I burned up my childhood days
I learned all the rules of the modern-day drifter
Don't you hold on to nothin' too long
Just take what you need from the ladies, then leave them
With the words of a sad country song
My heroes have always been cowboys
And they still are, it seems
Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of
Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams
Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery
From being alone too long
You could die from the cold in the arms of a nightmare
Knowin' well your best days are gone
Pickin' up hookers instead of my pen
I let the words of my years fade away
Old worn-out saddles, an' old worn-out memories
With no one and no place to stay
My heroes have always been cowboys
And they still are, it seems
Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of
Themselves and their slow-movin' dreamsSleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.
Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kiddies knock him down.
When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Walking in a winter wonderland,
Walking in a winter wonderland.I gotta turn you away so I can keep this hope alive
You're tapping on the window but I won't let you inside
Maybe you'll give up and find somebody else tonight
I draw the curtains say a prayer and turn out the light
Sorrow get away from my door
Don't come around
Don't come around
Don't come around here
No more
I won't welcome you in
From now on you're a stranger
Not a friend
I used to let you crawl right in make yourself at home
You'd burrow underneath my skin and wrap around my bones
But you've worn out your welcome so just walk on past this house
You ain't getting in here and I ain't coming out
Sorrow get away from my door
Don't come around
Don't come around
Don't come around here
No more
I won't welcome you in
From now on you're a stranger
Not a friend
(I ain't going down again)
I'm finally feeling strong
(I ain't going down again)
But I ain't made of stone
(I ain't going down again)
Leave me alone
I ain't going down again
Sorrow get away from my door
Don't come around
Don't come around
Don't come around here
No more
I won't welcome you in
From now on you're a stranger
Not a friendI won't go lookin' for you tonight I'd rather stay here at home
Than to see you holdin' her so tight in your arms where I belong
I followed you so many times to the places where you go
I watch you kiss her secretly while the lights're turned down low
I thought that if I see you holdin' another I can find someone too
I get lots of chances but I don't even bother cause I'm too busy missin' you
So I won't go looking for you tonight I'll wait till you come in
And when it's me that's holdin' you I know you're mine again
[ steel - dobro ]
I thought that if I see you holdin' another...Written by George Jones and Darrell Edwards
In the papers I saw you this morning
You were lovely, dressed in your wedding gown
And it said you would marry a stranger to me
That had drifted into our old home town
Accident'ly, you met him one ev'ning
And you say it was love at first sight
Accident'ly on purpose you're marryin'
Accident'ly on purpose, for spite
For you say that you saw me out painting the town
That I was just a fool with the heart of a clown
Accident'ly, you were mistaken that night
Accident'ly on purpose, for spite
Yes, you say that you saw me out painting the town
That I was just a fool with the heart of a clownThe days are long, the nights are lonely
Since you left me all alone
I loved you so, my little darlin'
I've worried so since you've been gone
Sweetheart of mine, can't you hear me callin'?
A million times, I've loved you best
I mistreated you, darlin', I'm sorry
Come back to me is my request
I remember now, the night we parted
A big mistake had caused it all
If you'll return, sunshine will follow
To stay away would be my fall
Sweetheart of mine, can't you hear me callin'?
A million times, I've loved you best
I mistreated you, darlin', I'm sorry
Come back to me is my request
The days are dark, my little darlin'
Oh, how I need your sweet embrace
When I awoke the sun was shinin'
When I looked up, I saw your face
Sweetheart of mine, can't you hear me callin'?
A million times, I've loved you best
I mistreated you, darlin', I'm sorry
Come back to me is my requestWhere were you when you left me alone?
Spent all my time sitting by the phone
Waiting for you to come around, but once again you let me down
Oh at the time I was too naive of a dreamer to ever believe in you
and all the promises you made just fell through
I wish I could go back in time
I wish I could of change your mind
From all the mistakes you made, but all this wishful thinking isn't gonna change a thing
So I have to be strong as I find my place in this world without you
I'll keep moving on cause' I'll never go back in time
Where are you now that I'm half grown
So many years flew by I bet you're feeling alone,
But you chose to walk away
Betray your baby girl,
And push me right out of your world
I wish I could go back in time
I wish I could of change your mind
From all the mistakes you made, but all this wishful thinking isn't gonna change a thing
So I have to be strong as I find my place in this world without you
I'll keep moving on cause' I'll never go back in time
I might not have you know but I'm doing just fine
I'm chasing my dreams
It's my time to shine
I'll never go back in time
I'll never change your mind
From all the mistakes you made
I'll never change a thing,
But that's just fine
Because I am strong
I found my place in this world without you
I'll keep moving on
Cause' I'll never go back in timeFor my girls
The fighters, the warriors
Broken glass inside
Won't cut
Through me
Pain behind my eyes
I turn
Into strength
Oh I will fight
I will survive
I am invincible
I am unbreakable
I am a diamond cut to last
I am unstoppable
I am a hero
Like a phoenix from the ash
Woah
Invincible
Cracks run through these walls
But they still stand strong
Oh, heart covered in scars
But my fear
Is gone
Oh I will fight
I will survive
I am invincible
I am unbreakable
I am a diamond cut to last
I am unstoppable
I am a hero
Like a phoenix from the ash
Woah
Nothin' gonna make me break or shatter
No one's gonna tell me I don't matter, no
I won't let you
Time is runnin' out, keeps gettin' faster
Gotta find a way, rewrite the answers
'Till I can say
I am invincible
I am unbreakable
I am a diamond cut to last
I am unstoppable
I am a hero
Like a phoenix from the ash
I am invincible
I am unbreakable
I am a diamond that will last
Woah
Woah
InvincibleI've been loving you too long it's time I sang a different song
You've been stringing me along I've been loving you too long
I've been clinging like a vine but I'm gonna take the time
To find where I belong I've been loving you too long
Babe I'm not saying that I've stopped loving you
That it won't be hard to say goodbye
I may never get your lovin' out of my head but I'm just saying that I've gotta try
I've been loving you too long...
[ dobro ]
No one owns another one and that's what you try
You tried to own me body mind and soul
Love to you's a oneway street all coming your way
But always givin's gettin' kind of gold
I've been loving you too long...Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, when will I learn
I push it down, push it down
I'm the one "for a good time call"
Phone's blowin' up, they're ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, feel the love

1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3 drink
1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3 drink
Throw 'em back, till I lose count
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
But I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight
Sun is up, I'm a mess
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame

Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight
On for tonightYou used to say you wanted someone to know you inside out
And as I look back on things well congratulations baby
Somebody knows you now
All of this time you told me you wished that you could figure yourself out
You say you're still a mystery but no not really not to me
Yeah somebody knows you now
I got a hundred bucks that says right now your hair's up in a clip
Your socks don't quite match and you're bitin' your lip
I can finish your thoughts or pick the right restaurants
Even order for you 'fore you sit down
Yeah somebody knows you now
So no matter where you life's path leads
Remember me somehow
And feel a little warm inside knowin' that somewhere tonight
Somebody knows you nowSilver coins that jingle jangle
dancing shoes and dancing ties
all the secrets of her dark eyes
they did sing the gypsy rise
yellow clover's entangles blossoms
in a meadow silver green
where she held me to her bosom
just a boy
of seventeen
CHORUS	I recall a gypsy woman
silver spangles in her eyes
ivory skin meets the moonlight and a taste of life's sweet wine
South breeze is low
from fragrant meadows
stir the darkness in my mind
oh gentle warm you sleep beside me
they don't know who haunts my mind
gypsy lady I hear your laughter and it dances in my head
while my tender wife and babies slumber softly in their bed
CHORUSBlue and gold behind me in the bleachers
Go Comanches on makeshift cardboard signs
We Will Rock You blaring through the hometown speakers
As I flew from the pyramid
In the last game of my life
A string of taillights on a dark and dusty dirt road
Bon fire burning back a Tommy Collars farm
Jakes leather jacket kept me from getting too cold
I was wrapped up in the moment
Wrapped up in his arms
::Chorus::
I wont forget
Seeing our breath
How warm it felt
Out in that freezing weather
The fire on his lips
Chills on my skin
Loving him turned to embers
Ill forever remember
That November
Heater cranked in his daddys Silverado
Little detour up on Cedar Hollow Ridge
I drew our names inside a heart on a foggy window
My daddy would have killed us both
If he knew what we did
:chorus:
The fire on his lips
Chills on my skin
Ill forever remember
That NovemberI bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you, let it be me
Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love what would life be
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love what would life be
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always---let--it be--meRight now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blond tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying
Her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her
With a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying "I'm drunk"
And he's a-thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably
Dabbing on three dollars
Worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know
That I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
I might have saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me!
No, not on me
'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Oh, maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Oh, before he cheats
OhAll the dogs are haunted
And the snow melts on the grass
You were what I wanted
But the fever could not last
In the day, I am dreaming
In the night, I am cold
While the stars are up there singing
All the dogs are growing old
No regrets, they're out the window
Frozen on the silver pane
Gone like winter, let the wind blow
Let the dogs howl at the rain
In the day, I am dreaming
In the night, I am cold
While the stars are up there singing
All the dogs are growing old
Oh, the cats are in the alley
And the rats are on the wire
Time is breathless as a blossom
And it's bursting with desire
And the dogs wander freely
Through the streets of long gone dreams
Drift like ghosts down the back roads
All the way to New Orleans
In the day, I am dreaming
In the night, I am cold
While the stars are up there singing
All the dogs are growing oldCold iron shackles, ball and chain
You listen to the whistle of the evening train
You know you bound to wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee Jed
Rich man step on my poor head
When you get back you better butter my bread
Well, you know it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee Jed
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee
Drink all day, rock all night
The law come to get you if you don't walk right
Got a letter this morning, baby, all it read
Get on back to Tennessee Jed
I dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Buddy, come quick with the Iodine
Catch a few winks, baby, under the bed
Head on back to Tennessee Jed
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee
Well, I run into Charlie Fog
He blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My doggie turned to me as he said
Let's head back to Tennessee Jed
And I woke up a feeling mean
Went on down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned round, and the letters read
You better head back to Tennessee Jed
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to TennesseeCome on out, come on out in the sunshine, baby
Come on out and trust yourself
Come on out, come on out in the sunshine, baby
Put your blues up on the shelf
I just want to wrap my arms around you
But I will never hold you down
I been waiting on the day I see you kick some dust up off the ground
When you step out of the shadows
Step out of the shadows
Step out of the shadows
Step out of the shadows, you're gonna walk in glory
Come on out, come on out of the darkness
Show the beauty in your soul
Feel your heart pounding
Let the rhythm and the breath of life unfold
I just want to wrap my arms around you
But I will never hold you back
Come on come on come on you've got to cut yourself some slack
Step out of the shadows
Step out of the shadows
Step out of the shadows
Walk in glory
All you really need is what you've got right now
Shine your light and tell your story
All god's children got to walk in glory
I'm just gonna wrap my arms around you
But I will never hold you back
Every little dream has got a string attached
When you step out of the shadows
Step out of the shadows
Step out of the shadows
Walk in gloryThat tin pot town went and spat me out
Onto that Eastern track
My dad he gave me a month or two
Before the city spat me back
A flat bed truck picked me up
And I crossed that great divide
I had 3 good days 'til I spent my pay
Now I'm on a downward slide
Oh I'm on a losing streak
Down a paddle I'm up the creek
Mercy be, I'm on a losing streak
The city don't place any worth
On a small town rouse about
I've never seen so many folks
But so few who'll help you outThere is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's vein; and sinners plunged beneath that flood
lose all their guilty stains.
Lose all their guilty stains,
lose all their guilty stains;
and sinners plunged beneath that flood
lose all their guilty stains.
The dying thief rejoiced to see
that fountain in his day;
and there may I, though vile as he,
wash all my sins away.
Wash all my sins away,
wash all my sins away;
and there may, I though vile as he,
wash all my sins way.Some people say
To go a long way
Forget about others
Think of number 1
Take what you can
From your fellow man
Doesn't matter who you walk upon
What happened to
Love your neighbor
As your self
Where it's needed
Give a little help
What happened to love
Some would sell
Their soul to hell
For all the things money can buy
Power and fame is the name of their game
But you can't take it with you when you die
What happened to
Blessed are the humble
And the weak
Blessed are the poor
We turn the other cheek
What happened to love
I prefer to live life by that old black book
It's guided me along life's way
Of every hour
Of every day
Down every road I've took
This world today
Has gone a stray
So many bound by selfishness and pride
Folk chivy and chase
What's worthless and base
And wonder why they're never satisfied
Tell me what
Happened to blessed are the pure
Isn't it beauty valued any more
What happened to love
What happened to love
What happened to loveIt only hurts for a little while
That's what they tell me that's what they say
It only hurts for a little while
Then all your heartaches will pass away
It's so easy to be smart with somebody else's heart
But I don't know how to start forgetting you what can I do
It only hurts for a little while
That's what they tell me just wait and see
But I will hurt till you come back to me
It's so easy to be smart
(It only hurts for a while)At my door the leaves are fallin'
A cold wild wind will come
Sweet hearts walked by together
And I still miss someone
I go out to a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
Cause I still miss someone
Oh I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
Oh I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was thereGuess you heard I'm doin' well
Struck it rich, to hear some folks tell
But I'm still the same old me
Down on Easy Street
You give your all to find that road
And you lose touch with some people as you go
Promises are hard to keep
Down on Easy Street
But when I lay down, and you're not there
Girl, I wish I was anywhere,
[Chorus]
But in this world where the telephone is all I touch
When I'm alone and no one ever really knows
The man inside of me
Up here in this lonely room just a-sippin' wine
And a-missin' you girl I've got everything
But what I need
That's why I'm down
Down on Easy Street
Someone told me you moved on
Well who could blame you, with me so often gone
But do you ever think of me
Down on Easy Street
If you're out this way, some week, some year
Girl, you'll still find me waitin' here
[Chorus: x2]
Down on Easy Street
Down on Easy Street
Guess you heard I'm doin' well.Won't you please turn up the lights
I can't hardly see
Thank you kindly but that don't help
Maybe it's just me
It seems I've had this problem since
My baby packed up to leave
You see she used to be my sunshine
Now we're far apart
Night is fallin' in my heart
Oh, the light is slowly fading
Skies are growing dark
Night is fallin' in my heart
Could you pull those curtains back
And let the morning in
What's that you say? Oh, is that a fact?
Well it still seems mighty dim
I guess I'll just have to live this way
Unless my baby comes back again
You see she used to be my sunshine
Now we're far apart
Night is fallin' in my heart
Oh, the light is slowly fading
And as the last ray of love
Slowly disappears
Alone in this endless night
I just see one thing clear
You see she used to be my sunshine
Now we're far apart
Night is fallin' in my heart
Oh, the light is slowly fadingWell I never once
Backed down from a punch
Well I'd take it square on the chin
Well I found out fast
A bully's just that
You've got to stand up to him
So I didn't cry when I got a black eye
As bad as it hurt, I just grinned
But when tough little boys grow up to be dads
They turn into big babies again.
Scared me to death
When you took your first steps
And I'd fall every time you fell down
Your first day of school, I cried like a fool
And I followed your school bus to town
Well I didn't cry, when Old Yeller died
At least not in front of my friends
But when tough little boys grow up to be dads
They turn into big babies again
Well I'm a grown man
And as strong as I am
Sometimes its hard to believe
That one little girl, with little blonde curls
Could totally terrify me
If you were to ask
My wife would just laugh
She'd say "I know all about men
How when tough little boys grow up to be dads
They turn into big babies again"
Well I know one day, I'll give you away
And I'm gonna stand there and smile
And when I get home, and I'm all alone
Well, I'll sit in your room for a while
Well I didn't cry when Old Yeller died
At least not in front of my friends
But when tough little boys grow up to be dads
They turn into big babies again
When tough little boys grow up to be dads
They turn into big babies again.This workin' all day ain't gettin' me nowhere
Breakin' my back won't get it done
Wish I had a dime, wish I had a dollar
For every dream that I gave up on, that I gave up on
This hammer I'm swingin' is startin' to feel heavy
I clench my fist when I punch the clock
a little for the back leaves nothin' for my baby
Stretchin' my paycheck around the clock
[Chorus]
I need to go face first into that fresh air
Free up there where the eagle flies
Need to drop the line in that cool clear water
Leave the city behind and get countrified
(Fit to be tied 3rd time only)
A fools gold watch and a lone line of black smoke
Is all I get for all I gave
My only reward for this broken down body was diggin' my way to an early grave
Alway dreamed I'd end up on a river
Fast asleep on a mountain high
But I'm way down here in this concrete valley
In a sea of bumpers and red tail lights, red tail lights
[repeat chorus twice]
This workin' all day ain't gettin' me nowhere
Breakin' my back won't get it done
Wish I had a dime, wish I had a dollar
For every dream that I gave up on, that I gave up onI didn't plan to fall in love with you it just happened that way
And all the time inside my heart I knew that I'd regret it some day
Now I can't stand to be away from you but I'm alone every day
I didn't plan to fall in love with you it just happened that way
I saw you and I loved you why I'll never know
There wasn't one chance in a million that our love would grow
You were too far up above me any fool could plainly see
But like driftwood on the river I floated on helplessly
I didn't plan to fall in loveWhen a man loves a woman the way that I love you
In his eyes there's no one else to make his dreams come true
When a man loves a woman the way that I love you
She alone can give the strength he needs to carry through woman I love you
You are my inspiration you're my way to happiness
Things that you do for me show the love that you possess
When a man loves a woman the way that I love you
In his eyes there's no one else to make his dreams come true woman I love you
You are my inspirationAnother day break wakes me up to a hotel lobby coffee cup
That dirty old white pickup truck with the trailer hooked up by the Denny's, she's mine
Last night's bugs on the windshield, fast food trash on the dash meal
Speedin' ticket and a doctor bill from a gash I got from a short go in Casper
Summer of last year, maybe next year
And a ride, and a fall, one day I might win 'em all
Just some broken hearts and broken bones, and a hell of a whole lot of bein' alone
But a right, and a wrong, where I hang my hat is home
This cowboy life might kill me, but it's the only one I know
Cell phone was breakin' up, the night she called to say she'd had enough
Of my little white lies and little white lines and wantin' somebody who could never be with her
I look back on every fork in the road that I took to chase that buckle of gold
And wonder if what I held for what I hold is worth tradin' away
Hell I don't know, all I know
Is a ride, and a fall, one day I might win 'em all
Just some broken hearts and broken bones, and a hell of a whole lot of bein' alone
But a right, and a wrong, where I hang my hat is home
This cowboy life might kill me, but it's the only one I know
Yeah it'll kill me, before it ever lets me go
It'll kill me, but it's the only life I know
And I'd rather die than be caught cryin'
So I'm just smilin', wear my hat down low
Wear my hat down low
And a ride, and a fall, one day I might win 'em all
Just some broken hearts and broken bones, and a hell of a whole lot of bein' alone
But a right, and a wrong, where I hang my hat is home
This cowboy life might kill me, but it's the only one I know
Yeah this cowboy life might kill me, but it's the only one I knowI don't care if it rains
(Let's all go to the bar)
I don't care if there's a hurricane
(Let's all go to the bar)
And I don't care if I'm the one to blame
(Let's all go to the bar)
Gimme, gimme, gimme, I always want more
(Let's all go to the bar)
I don't wanna go to the liquor store
(Let's all go to the bar)
I got enough at home for after last call
(Let's all go to the bar)
I don't care if you're already drunk
(Let's all go to the bar)
This is one night school that I won't flunk
(Let's all go to the bar)
I'm not gonna stand for being down on my luck
(Let's all go to the bar)
Forget if you'll regret it when the morning comes
We'll have a heart attack, we're having too much fun
If the cops show up we ought run, run, run
But we'll laugh in their faces when they tell us we're done
I don't care if you puke in my ride
(Let's all go to the bar)
Baby, just as long as you take your piss outside
(Let's all go to the bar)
I don't care what daddy says, you're coming out tonight
(Let's all go to the bar)
Pack of cigarettes and a fake ID
(Let's all go to the bar)
We don't like it baby if it don't come cheap
(Let's all go to the bar)
Now listen up, though, cause I don't think you heard me!
Forget if you'll regret it when the morning comes
We'll have a heart attack, we're having too much fun
If the cops show up we ought run, run, run
But we'll laugh in their faces when they tell us we're done
I don't care if it rains
(Let's all go to the bar)
I don't care if there's a hurricane
(Let's all go to the bar)
I don't care if I'm the one to blame
(Let's all go to the bar)
Let's all go to the bar
Let's all go to the bar
Let's all go to the barAnd I want you to want me

And I want you to want me
Yeah, I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
Oh, I want you to want meIf a single drop of honey
Would bring you to me
I'd break that sweet rock open
And hold it out for thee
She asked him for a penny
He gave her a dime
She asked him to stay forever
He said "all will come in time"
If a single drop of honey
Would bring you to me
I'd break that sweet rock open
And hold it out for thee
She prayed for him to come back
He sent a voice true
She barely heard the words
He said "I'm not so far from you"
If a single drop of honey
Would bring you to me
I break that sweet rock open
And hold it out for theeIf you're a man like me who's good at leaving
If you like your space and you love your freedom
Don't see yourself as ever settling down
Or your whole world being tossed around
Be wary of a woman
A woman so fine
Don't wanna change you
Loves you just right
Makes you feel like a man inside
Sometimes she'll make you cry
Till you don't know what your doing
Your out of control
Forget about leaving your heart wont go
If don't like that you better run and hide
And be wary of a woman like mine
Shell make you laugh when you feel like crying
Make you wanna live when you feel like dying
So if you like living in the dark
Just walk away your gonna lose your heart
Be wary of a woman
A woman so fine
Don't wanna change you
Loves you just right
Makes you feel like a man inside
Sometimes she'll make you cry
Till you don't know what your doing
Your out of control
Forget about leaving your heart wont go
If don't like that you better run and hide
And be wary of a woman like mine
Be wary of a woman like mine
Man you don't stand a chance don't even try
Be wary of a woman like mine
Be wary of a woman
A woman so fine
Don't wanna change you
Loves you just right
Makes you feel like a man inside
Sometimes she'll make you cry
Till you don't know what your doing
Your out of control
Forget about leaving your heart wont go
If don't like that you better run and hide
And be wary of a woman like mine
A woman like mine
Be wary of a woman like mine
A woman like mineWhen your mountains all seem to crumble
And you fall down into the valley
He'll pick you up and give you strength
To climb another mountain
So put your faith and your trust in Him
God's gonna take you to the very end
Well there's no need to worry
'Cause God is standing by
If you need a touch from Jesus
This very hour
Knock on the door
Step right on in and cry out loud
He's upstairs on His Throne
He'll give you grace and power
Tell the servant you need the Master
And I'm sure, so very sure
He'll be right down
When your burdens sometimes they get heavy
And you feel just like you can't go on
Why don't you think about all the things
That God has done for you (you better count your blessings)
Pick up the phone, why don't you dial His number
My God is waiting, waiting to hear you call
Jesus, I need you
I need you right now (right now)It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shacked by forgotten words and boons
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks and I'd be planted
On their columns now that binds me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the back roads by the rivers of my memory
For hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junk yards and the highways come between us
And some other woman crying to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And a summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walking on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurgling crackling caltron
In some train yard
My beard a roughen coal pile and a dirty hat
That pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands around a tin
Can I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waving from the back roads by the rivers of my memory
Ever smiling ever gentle on my mindOh, oh
I was dreaming of war
Saw that I wouldn't die
Was dreaming of choice
That my ship would fight
I was dreaming because
It made me feel so alive
Was dreaming it all
From my bed last night
You will be my only one
Hold my hand so we can run
You and I, we're staying young, yeah
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
This time, I want it all
I want it right now, feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
This time, I want it all
I want it right now, wanna feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
I was feeling a storm
But it wasn't outside
Was feeling a force
I'm electrified
I was feeling my heart
There was thunder inside
Was feeling it all
From my bed last night
You will be my only one
Hold my hand so we can run
You and I, we're staying young, yeah
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
This time, I want it all
I want it right now, feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
This time, I want it all
I want it right now, wanna feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
All the things that I don't know
All the dreams that I've been shown
All the ways that it could end
Tonight close your eyes
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
This time, I want it all (I want it all)
I want it right now, feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy (go crazy)
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
This time, I want it all (I want it all)
I want it right now, wanna feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
Oh, oh, oh, hey
Oh, oh, oh, forever
We're gonna live, we're gonna live foreverI never thought it would hurt me so bad
Seein' you look so good
You're moving on and you're not lookin' back
Just like I hoped I would
How do you stop lovin' someone
And turn what we had into nothin'
I wish I could
You make it look so easy
The way that you got over me
You act as if your leavin' was natural as the air you breathe
You're so together while I'm fallin' apart
You make it look so easy
And that's what makes it so hard
I've seen you out at at the places we went
Dancin' with someone new
You didn't take long to start livin' again
After our life was through
How do you let go of the good times
With a wave of your hand and a goodbye
I wish I knew
You make it look so easy
The way that you got over me
You act as if your leavin' was natural as the air you breathe
And you're so together while I'm fallin' apart
You make it look so easy
And that's what makes it so hard
You make it look so easy
And that's what makes it so hardI've got a-achin' in my heart, arson on my mind
I'm gonna burn your playhouse down
I've got a badly broken heart, yes, I've had it from the start
You've given me the run around.
Now if you play with fire it's a-sure to burn
I've heard you told him a lie
So be on your way, I've had my say
Well honey, I'm through with you for now.
You'll find there's one in every yard and I'm a-gettin' mighty tired
I'm gonna burn your playhouse down.
--- Instrumental ---
I've got a-achin' in my heart, arson on my mind
I'm gonna burn your playhouse down
I've got a badly broken heart, I've had it from the start
You've given me the run around.
Now if you play with fire it's a-sure to burn
I've heard you told him a lie
Go on, be on your way, well honey, I've had my say
'Cause I'm through with you for now
I've got an achin' in my heart, arson on my mind
I'm gonna burn your playhouse down.
--- Instrumental ---
Now, don't pretend that this is the end
'Cause this time we're really through
While you're runnin' around burnin' up the town
Well, I set my cap for you.
I'm gonna burn your playhouse down...Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end
The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again
Together again
The gray skies are gone
Your back in my arms
Now where you belong
The love that I knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters
We're together againI can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't
Baby I know that you've been wondering
Mmm, so here goes nothing
In case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy 'bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long, long time ago
In case you didn't know
The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it, mmm
There was something 'bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking
One of the things that I've been feeling
Mmm it's time you here 'em
In case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy 'bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long, long time ago
In case you didn't know
You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah you're my everything
In case you didn't know
I'm crazy 'bout you
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long, long time ago
Yeah you had my heart a long, long time ago
Mmm, in case you didn't know
No, no in case you didn't knowAnother night in separate rooms
We quietly nurse our wounds
I tell myself I'd be better off on my own
I say girl, just walk away
There is nothing left to say
But then I stop and think of spending my life all alone
There's a war in me
The battle lines are drawn
I'm torn between letting go and hanging on
What's right, what's wrong
It's so hard to tell
There's a war in me
And war is hell
When life peeks through the curtain cracks
I look beyond the smoke and ash
I start remembering the laughter more than the tears
I say girl, you can't give up
Deep down you're still in love
But then I stop and think our love has been dying for years
There's a war in me
The battle lines are drawn
I'm torn between letting go and hanging on
What's right, what's wrong
It's so hard to tell
There's a war in me
And war is hell
I finally made up my mind
I pray in time I find peace
But right now in my heart as I leave
There's a war in me
The battle lines are drawn
I'm torn between letting go and hanging on
What's right, what's wrong
It's so hard to tell
There's a war in me
And war is hell
There's a war in me
And war is hellHow in this world
Can we put a man on the moon
And still have a need
For a place like St. Jude's
Why is one man born
In a place where all they know is war
And a guy like me,
Has always been free
How can two people
Who've built a loving home
Try for years
And never have a child of their own
When somewhere out there tonight
There's a baby no one's holding tight
In need of love
To me that don't add up
I wasn't there the day you filled up the oceans
I didn't get to see you hang the stars in the sky
So I don't mean to second guess you
Or criticize what I don't understand
These are just a few questions I have
Why did my cousin
Have to die in that crash
A good kid only seventeen
I still wonder 'bout that
It seems unfair to me
Some get the chance to chase their dreams
And some don't
But what do I know
I wasn't there the day you filled up the oceans
I didn't get to see you hang the stars in the sky
So I don't mean to second guess you
Or criticize what I don't understand
These are just a few questions I have
Why do I feel like
You hear these prayers of mine
When so many ought to be
Ahead of me in line
When you look down on me
Can you see the good through all the bad
These are just a few questions I have[Originally recorded by Don Henley]
I can see that you haven't recovered
From the girl who let you down
But you'd sell what is left of your soul
For another go-round
You keep tellin' yourself she means nothin'
And maybe you should call her bluff
But you don't really believe it
You must not be drinkin' enough
Oh, the perfume she wore
You can buy down at the Five and Dime
But on some other woman
It don't smell the same in your mind
You keep tellin' yourself that you can take it
You keep tellin' yourself that you're tough
But you still wanna hold her
So you must not be drinkin' enough
Oooh
You're not drinkin' enough
To wash away old memories
And there ain't enough whiskey in Texas
To keep you from beggin'
Please, please, please
She passed on your passion
And stepped on your pride
Turns out you ain't quite so tough
'Cause you still wanna hold her
You must not be drinkin' enough
Ay-yi-yi-yi, you ask yourself why
But you still wanna hold her
You must not be drinkin' enough, no
Ay-yi-yi-yi, ay-yi-yi-yi
Whoa, you still wanna hold her
You must no be drinkin' enough
Ay-yi-yi-yi, ay-yi-yi-yi
Oh, I still wanna hold her
I must not be drinkin' enoughYesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Oh, I believe in yesterdayWe have been saved
For these latter days
We have been made
To follow His way
There may be times
We might turn in despair
But He is always there
We will go on
And we will not fall
And we will not run
We will be strong
Through the darkest night
We'll stand and fight
Through the deepest pain
Our love remains
And we will go on
This battle of life
Rages outside
So we face the storm
We're ready to ride
And there may be times
We must stand on our own
But we are never alone
We will go on
And we will not fall
And we will not run
We will be strong
Through the darkest night
We'll stand and fight
Through the deepest pain
Our love remains
And we will go on
The day will come when we will be with Him again
But until then
We must go on
And we cannot fall
And we cannot run
We must be strong
Through the darkest night
We'll stand and fight
Through the deepest pain
Love will remain
And we will go on
We will go on
We will go onSmoking down the track
I'm a fireball mill
Lord, coal's so black
Can't even see the rail
Followin' tongues of steel
Behind, I drive the wheel
Pulls the weight of the world
Coming up the road
Another rubber tire four
They got us hooked on oil
'Til the pipeline blow
Such a shame to see
Adding World War Three
To the weight of the world
Yeah, the weight of the world
Up the top of a mountain
Well I ne'er should
Poisonous as the river
With the devils's own sludge
It's the American dream
But if you live downstream
Here comes the weight of the world
Ton of plastic bottles
Headed out to sea
Bound to build an island
Thanks to you and me
Another man-made pearl
For the junk we hurl
Top the weight of the world
Yeah, the weight of the world
I got to feed the baby
Recompense the rent
For the way I think I?
Where all the money went
Well there's a piper to pay
Can't get away
From the weight of the world
Look up in the sky
Is it a bird or a plane?
Taking love to [delight?]
Drove us all insane
Since it send us reeling
The only thing with feeling
Is the weight of the world
First we get so numb
Then we all succumb
To the weight of the world
Yeah the weight of the world
(Let me get my guitar in there one more time)Sweet hour of prayer
Sweet hour of prayer
That calls me from a world of care
And bids me at my Father's throne
Make all my wants and wishes known
In seasons of distress and grief
My soul has often found relief
And oft escaped the tempter's snare
By Thy return, sweet hour of prayer
Sweet hour of prayer
Sweet hour of prayer
The joys I feel, the bliss I share
Of those whose anxious spirits burn
With strong desires for Thy return
With such I hasten to the place
Where God my Savior shows His face
And gladly take my station there
And wait for Thee, sweet hour of prayer
Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer
And wait for Thee, Sweet hour of prayerFor two long weeks you're goin' to Kansas City
And I'm a sure I'm gonna miss you while you're gone
This ol' town will seem to die without you
But it sure will come to life when you come home
So take care of you for me in Kansas City
And honey, call me every now and then
Take care of you for me in Kansas City
'Cause I'll miss you till you're in my arms again
Now honey, watch those Kansas City Romeos
And don't let them fool you with their charms
Have a lot of fun but remember that I love you
And I'm a waiting here with my two open arms
So take care of you for me in Kansas City
And honey, call me every now and then
Take care of you for me in Kansas City
'Cause I'll miss you till you're in my arms again
Now, I ain't never been to Kansas City
But I've heard stories about the girls that's gone
So if you just gotta go to Kansas City
Take your time a gettin' there but hurry home
And so take care of you for me in Kansas City
And honey, call me every now and then
Take care of you for me in Kansas City
'Cause I'll miss you till you're in my arms again
Yes, I'll miss you till you're in my arms againI left home when I was seventeen
I just grew tired of falling down
And I'm sure I was told
The allure of the road
Would be all I found
And all the answers that I started with
Turned out questions in the end
So years roll on by
And just like the sky
The road never ends
And the people who love me still ask me
When are you coming back to town
And I answer quite frankly
When they stop building roads
And all God needs is gravity to hold me downHere you are back on my mind where you stay quite a lot
Bringing back all the old memories I thought I'd forgot
I just keep finding you with me and I don't know why
Maybe, I should've been listening when you said, goodbye
I can't believe how you keep hanging on to my mind
Now I know leaving means one goes and one stays behind
I can't escape from you no matter how hard I try
Maybe, I should've been listening when you said, goodbye
Maybe, I should've been watching when you walked away
Maybe, you wouldn't keep turning up day after day
If I'd paid attention I'd know you didn't lie
Maybe, I should've been listening when you said, goodbye
Maybe, I should've been listening you said, goodbyeIf you can find it in your heart to just forgive
I'll come back and live the way you wanted me to live
All I want is just to be your girl
Please come and get me and take me to your world
Take me to your world away from barrooms filled with smoke
Where I won't have to serve a drink or hear another dirty joke
All I want is just to be your girl
Please come and get me and take me to your world
Take me to your world away from home the things I've heard
Where people say I love you and love is not a dirty word
All I want is just to be your girl
Please come and get me and take me to your world
Please come and get me and take me to your worldDon't-a forbid me to hold you tight
Darling, Don't Forbid Me to hold you tight
Let-a me hold you in my lovin' arms
'Cause it's cold and I can keep you warm
Don't a forbid me to kiss your lips
Darling, Don't Forbid Me to kiss your lips
Let-a me kiss you please baby, please
'Cause it's cold and your lips might freeze.
There's a strong Westwind a-blowing
and there's a big, blue moon above
And, pretty baby, I'll be knowing
you need some heartwarming love
So don't-a forbid me to talk sweet talk
Darling, Don't Forbid Me to talk sweet talk
Let-a me fill your little heart with fireWe don't need the world outside, we've got all we need tonight
Love is Enough, oh yeah yeah
Let 'em say what they want to say, when you're holdin' me this way,
Love is Enough
Everybody searchin' for a piece of mind, all they gotta do is look at you and I
Baby, just wait and see you can always count on me, When times getting tough
You're the reason that I'm livin' nothing that i wouldn't give
Love is Enough
May never have a lot of money, but it don't really matter honey
Love is Enough
Ain't it funny how 4 little letters, can hold it all together
Love is Enough
Even when we're old and gray, I'll be here and you can still hear me say
Baby, just wait and see you can always count on me, When times getting tough
You're the reason that I'm livin' nothing that i wouldn't give
Love is Enough
Long kisses and a tender touch, 2 hearts make a leap,
What else do we need?
Baby, just wait and see you can always count on me, When times getting tough
You're the reason that I'm livin' nothing that i wouldn't give
Love is Enough(Merle Haggard)
To you I may never be more than a friend
But you'll always be special to me
To you I may never be closer than I am
But you'll always be special to me
Maybe I set my sights too high to be real
I may be wrong, but love is strong
And I can't hide how I feel
To you I may never be closer than I am
But you'll always be special to me
Maybe I set my sights too high to be real
But love is strong, I may be wrong
But I can't hide how I feel
To you I may never be closer than I am
But you'll always be special to meI Can't Believe That You've Stopped Loving Me
Tomorrow I'll say Happy Birthday darling
And surprise you with a gift when I come home
Then my forgetful arms will reach out for you
I can't forget you just because you're gone
[Chorus:]
I can't believe that you stopped loving me
It's too much for me to understand
How can anything so real become a dream
I can't believe that you've stopped loving me
I sifted all the reasons why you left me
And I've gone back and relived all the love we had
For every tear we lost I found a thousand smiles
And the good times always outweighed the bad
[Chorus:]
I can't believe that you stopped loving me
It's too much for me to understand
How can anything so real become a dream
I can't believe that you've stopped loving me
I can't believe that you've stopped loving meI'm going out of my mind these days
Like I'm walking ?round in a haze
Can't think straight, can't concentrate
I need a shave
I go to work and I look tired
The boss says son you're gonna get fired
This ain't your style
And behind my coffee cup
I just smile
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing that I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
I can't get enough
Or stop this hunger for your love
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
This morning I put salt in my coffee
I put my shoes on the wrong feet
Losing my mind I swear
You might be the death of me
But I don't care
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing that I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
I can't get enough
Or stop this hunger for your love
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Is it your eyes, is it your smile
All I know is that you're driving me wild
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing that I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
I can't get enough
Or stop this hunger for your love
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm inGreen green it's green they say on the farside of the hill
Green green I'm going away to where the grass is greener still
Well I told my mama on the day I was born
Don't you cry when you see I'm gone
You know there ain't no woman gonna settle me down
I just gotta be travelin' on
Green green it's green they say...
Oh there ain't nobody in this whole wide world
Gonna tell me how to spend my time
I'm just a good lovin' ramblin' man
Say buddy could you spare me a dime
Green green it's green they say...
Well I don't care when the sun goes down
Where I can lay my weary head
Green green valley or rocky road
It's where I'm gonna make my bed
Green green it's green they say...
To where the grass is greener still
To where the grass is greener stillDeep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San AntoneOh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!
But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!Uh, Ricky Tidwell was a great athlete
He was a big strong boy that was quick on his feet
And every college in the country wanted Ricky blocking on their line
But when the scouts came knocking on Ricky's door
They didn't want to talk to young Rick no more
When they saw his mama she's the one they wanted to sign
She was a real bold woman raised on a farm
Had Bear Bryant tattooed on her forearm
She was meaner than heck ran the 40 in 4.3
Well she could squat 600 bench press 5
The hands down meanest homemaker alive
Got a scholarship playing linebacker in the SEC
Ricky Tidwell's mama is gonna play football
Her real name's Doris but they're gonna call her Too Tall
She's got shoulders and a hind end four foot wide
Going to college on a full ride
Mrs. Tidwell's wouldn't play in the NC-double-A
She would wash all her team mates uniforms
Tucked everybody in in the football dorms
Cooked the game meal, say the Lord's prayer
You're missing a jockstrap? She's got a spare
Crawled in the huddle, and called all the plays
The only one tough enough to go both ways
Yeah, her mouth full of mud, scoured up knees
Cussing out the coaches and the referees
Ricky Tidwell's mama's gonna play football
Her real name's Doris
Everybody calls her Too Tall
They say she's a fine young man but she's really not
She's the master of the cheap shot
And on the triple option play she'd ruin your day
She led the team in tackles and the league in sacks
Responsible for killing nine running backs
But the school's reputation was destroyed
They accused Ricky's mama of steroids
(I thought that woman was awful stout)
Oh Ricky Tidwell's mama's on probation
Well the college has started an investigation
They wouldn't leave poor Ricky Tidwell's mama alone
Said she'd been takin' male hormones
Mrs. Tidwell's gonna do well
In the NFL
Ricky Tidwell's mama
(15 yard penalty, illegal use of a clothesline)
Ricky Tidwell's mama
(Can I have your autograph ma'am)
Ricky Tidwell's mama
(Or is that sir)
Ricky Tidwell's mamaI should have took you dancing
A little candlelight romancing, with roses
But I was high up on a bar stool
Yeah, I was such a blind fool
Now I know it
You won't believe how much I've changed since you left
It took losing you for me to find myself
Oh I wish that you could see me
Steady hands without the whiskey
You'd be so proud
I got a job down at the factory
A brand new suit for Sunday
And I'm in church now
It's been one year since I sat behind a bar
I went by the junkyard,
And they've still got our car
I still see you on your knees
Begging me not to drive
But I took away the keys
And made you climb inside
And I'd take your place in this field of stone
If I only had to power
Look what it took
For me to finally bring you flowers
Lord, I'd take your place in this field of stone
If I only had the power
Look what it took
For me to finally bring you flowers
Yeah look what it took
For me to finally bring you flowersSee the engine puffing, boy she's making time
That old trains wearing out the rail, rail, rail
Heading for the mountain that she's got to climb
Bringing in the Georgia mail
Ninety miles an hour and she's gaining speed
Listen to the whistle moan and wail, wail, wail
Has she got the power I'll say yes indeed
Bringing in the Georgia mail
See the driver's travel watch her spin the track
Ought to put that engineer in jail, jail, jail
Has he got her rolling watch her ball the jack
Bringing in the Georgia mail
Rocking and a reeling spouting off the steam
Stoke the fire and hope the brakes don't fail, fail, fail
Serving all the people listen to her scream
Bringing in the Georgia mailI want to go home I want to go home oh Lord I want to go home
Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City
And I dreamed about those cotton fields and home
I dreamed about my mother dear old papa sister and brother
I dreamed about that girl who's been waiting for so long
I want to go home I want to go home oh Lord I want to go home
Home folks think I'm big in Detroit City
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars by night I make the bars
If only they could read between the lines
'Cause you know I rode a freight train north to Detroit City
And after all these years I find I've just been wasting my time
So I just think I'll take ol' Charley Pride put him on a Southbound freight and ride
And go on back to the loved ones the ones that I left waiting so far behind
I want to go home I want to go home oh Lord I want to go home
I want to go home I want to go home I want to go gome(Bill Fries, Chip Davis)
Well, Interstate 80, we was cuttin' the fog
Just me an' old Sloan (Old Sloan's my dog)
We had an eighteen-wheeler with ten on the floor and stereo layin' a strip
Now we spied a sign, says "Eat Gas Now"
We decided to whip in and pick up some chow
At the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe
[Chorus]
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin'
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' (a-lookin' for Mavis)
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe
Now we've been every place between here and South Sioux
And we've seen us a truck-stop waitress or two
But this gal's built like a burlap bag full of bobcats:
She's got it to-gether
Well, she filled my tank; I said "Thank you, honey."
Her name was Mavis, I gave her the money
Old Sloan just set there, watchin' and waggin' and wishin'.
I says, "You wait in the truck, boy."
Then I went inside. She says, "What'll it be?"
I says "A cup of your best and a number three."
She come back with an order to go and a quart of hot C and a bone for Sloan.
I said, "Much obliged"; old Sloan gave a bark
I left her a buck and he left his heart
At the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe
[Chorus]
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin'
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin'
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe
Well, Saturday night we was truckin' along
Yeah, me and old Sloan was a-gettin' it on
I said, "Sloan, I've been thinkin' on a-gettin' up my courage, and tonight's the night"
Well, I popped the clutch, gave the tranny a spin
Took the Beebeetown ramp and slid on in
To the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe
[Chorus]
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin'
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' (it never closes)
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe
Well, I got me a stool, took a load off my shoes,
Made Mavis an offer that she couldn't refuse
I says, "How'd ya like to go for a ride with me and old Sloan? I just had my truck warshed."
She allowed as how it sounded like a whole lot of fun
But we was gonna have ta wait until the dishes was done
And was it all right with me if she brought along her mother as a chaperone?
I said, "Why not?"
Well, we geared that tranny into super-low
And the four of us went to see a picture show
Yeah, I took 'em to the drive-in the-a-ter over by Pisgah, to see True Grit
Saw the late, late show; old Sloan hit the sack
And then along about two o'clock I hauled 'em all back
To the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe
[Chorus]
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin'
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin'
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe (eight stools and a promise)
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin'
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin'
Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe (they got a real nice place there)Heartbroken me, lonesome as can be
Heartbroken, sad and so blue
Lonesome for your charms and your lovin' arms
Heartbroken 'cause I'm losin' you.
Most every night I lie awake
Just cryin' 'cause we're through
I'd give the world if I could hear
That she's been cryin' too.
Heartbroken me, lonesome as can be
Heartbroken 'cause I'm losin' you.
Heartbroken me, lonesome as can be
Heartbroken, sad and so blue
Lonesome for your charms and your lovin' arms
Heartbroken 'cause I'm losin' you.
Most every night I lie awake
Just cryin' 'cause we're through
I'd give the world if I could hear
That she's been cryin' too.
Heartbroken me, lonesome as can be
Heartbroken 'cause I'm losin' youI'm dreamin' tonight of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know it's a long road back
I promise you
I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light beams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreamsWhat a time to turn your back on someone
What a day to be without a friend
What a shame when no-one seems to bother
Who will offer shelter to candles in the wind
And it follows we are only helpless children
Ever changing like sunlight through the trees
It's a long road we must cling to one another
Help yourselves to each other, that's the way it's meant to be
And it's said that life is like a ladder
Just a dream we're reaching for the stars
Can't you see how little really matters
We are only searching for what we really are
And it follows we are only helpless children
Ever changing like sunlight through the trees
It's a long road we must cling to one another
Help yourselves to each other, that's the way it's meant to beLets play this one out, until it explodes
Into a thousand tiny pieces
Whats the story universe
You are melody in numbers
You were shapes you were rhythms
There are signs that we can learn
Place over the heavens
To predict how long well burn
How long will I last?
Can you turn up the heat?
What star am I circling?
Whats circling me?
Am I ebb, am I flow?
My lack of control
Turn it on, turn it up
Say yes, play no
Things keep changing
Things keep changing
Things keep changingPeople always comin' up to me and askin'
"Dolly, what's your secret?
With all you do, your attitude
Just seems to be so good
How do you keep it?"
Well, I'm not the Dalai Lama, but I'll try
To offer up a few words of advice.
Chorus:
You better get to livin', givin'
Don't forget to throw in a little forgivin'
And lovin' on the way
You better get to knowin', showin'
A little bit more concerned about where you're goin'
Just a word unto the wise
You better get to livin'.
A girlfriend came to my house
Started cryin' on my shoulder Sunday evening
She was spinnin' such a sad tale
I could not believe the yarn that she was weavin'
So negative the words she had to say
I said if I had a violin I'd play.
I said you'd better get to livin', givin'
Be willing and forgivin'
Cause all healing has to start with you
You better stop whining, pining
Get your dreams in line
And then just shine, design, refine
Until they come true
And you better get to livin'.
Your life's a wreck, your house is mess
And your wardrobe way outdated
All your plans just keep on falling through
Overweight and under paid, under appreciated
I'm no guru, but I'll tell you
This I know is true.
You better get to livin', givin'
A little more thought about bein'
A little more willin' to make a better way
Don't sweat the small stuff
Keep your chin up
Just hang tough
And if it gets too rough
Fall on your knees and pray
And do that everyday
Then you'll get to livin'.
The day we're born we start to die
Don't waste one minute of this life
Get to livin'
Share your dreams and share your laughter
Make some points for the great hereafter.
Better start carin'
Better start sharin'
Better start tryin'
Better start smiling
And you better get to livin'...Just about the time I pull myself together
When the hurt in me gets better than it's been
Just about the time I feel life's still worth living it's funny here comes honey again
Honey comes and honey stays just long enough to tear my mind up
Then she leaves me just the way I knew she would
And I have to start all over start to picking up the pieces
Times like this I almost wish she'd go for good
Just about the time I'd find myself a new love
When this broken heart she left me starts to mend
Then that's just about the time that I'll be saying it's funny here comes honey again
[ steel ]
Just about the time I feel life's till worth living
It's funny here comes honey again it's funny here comes honey againSeasons come and seasons go
One day sun, the next day snow
Flowers die and flowers grow
But love is never-ending
[Bridge]
You can't kill it with goodbye
It always finds a place to hide
Inside your heart for your whole life
Love is never-ending
[Chorus]
When the lights have all gone down
It'll still be hangin' 'round
Even when you think it's lost, it can still be found
When every memory has been made
And the pages start to fade
And every prayer you ever prayed is heaven bound
When you think the ride is over
You're back at the beginning
Oh,love is never-ending
When a man and a woman start growin' old
The fire of passion may grow cold
But what they got still warms their soul
Love is never-ending
[Chorus]
It keeps goin' on and on
Long after we're all gone away
[Bridge]
Time may change what you believe
But one day the truth will set you free
Just have faith and you will see
Love is never-ending
[Bridge]
Love is never-endingWell, I'm just a Workin' Man's Dollar
In the pocket of his old blue jeans
I ain't like my Wall Street brother
He's in a bank so shiny and clean
Well, I'm faded and I'm wrinkled
Tattered and stained with sweat
But I'm the 1st one called when Uncle Sam Needs a hand with the
National Debt
I've been wages for the farm hand
For drivin' an old John Deere
I've been laid on a bar in a tavern
To buy a workin' man an ice-cold beer
I've been tipped to a truck-stop waitress
Taped where I was torn
And in the hand of a child I was laid on a plate
In a church on Sunday morn
[Chorus]
They say I'm the root of all evil
I bring lust, power and greed
But this Workin' Man's Dollar only buys the things
A workin' man really needs
Well, they say I'm worth about fifty-cents
In this modern inflated age
But don't tell that to the young man slavin'
To make it on a minimum wage
Or that single workin' mother
She's been scapin' to make ends meet
To make a house a home
Keep food on the table
And shoes on her baby's feet
Well, I know my days are numbered
I'm gettin' threadbare and wearin' thin
And they'll replace me with another
But I'd do it all again
'Cause I've seen this great big country
Passed from hand to callused hand
And I've got to say that I'm mighty proud
That I belong to a workin' manOnce upon a time you dressed so fine threw the bums a dime in your prime didn't you
People'd call say you're bound to fall you thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about everybody that was hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal
How does it feel how does it feel with no directions home
Like a complete unknown like a rolling stone
Princess on the steeple all the pretty people drinkin' thinkin' they got it made
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts
You'd better lift your diamond ring you'd better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused at Napoleon in rags and the language he used
Pull to him now he calls you you can't refuse
When you got nothin' you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now you got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel how does it feel to be without a home
To be on your own like a complete unknown like a rolling stone just like a rolling stone(Emily Kaitz)
My Daddy was a man of letters
My Mama was a head of state
And when they got their chromosomes together
They gave me all of their recessive traits
I'm an embarrassment to evolution
My disposition is unstable and cruel
My blood's a catastrophic blend
'Cause I'm from the shallow end of the gene pool
My IQ is a negative number
I've got a sense of humor no one can stand
And my development was seriously encumbered
By playing music with the Lounge Lizards band
I'm a social director's nightmare
At dinner parties I just babble and drool
It's not easy making friends
When you're from the shallow end of the gene pool
Chorus:
I'm from the shallow end of the gene pool
My x-rays make the doctors laugh
When they tried to chart my EEG waves
Well I wasn't even on the graph
Biological research is booming
They're making breakthroughs like you wouldn't believe
They say genetic engineering in humans
Will someday soon be a reality
I'm gonna get me a DNA transplant
They're gonna rearrange my molecules
Some natural laws will have to bend
To get me from the shallow end of the gene poolYou promised love that never would end but now you are gone and the hurtin' begins
Just what do you mean that I'm no more than a friend
Oh darling have you forgotten so soon
Love that we knew just fell by the way the tears from my eyes fall day after day
There was a time we were carefree and gay oh darling have you forgotten so soon
Lost is our love that we found long ago warm memories so soon have grown cold
Now where are the dreams that we dreamed long ago
Oh darling have you forgotten so soon my darling have you forgotten so soonI'd be the last one to tell you that you shouldn't go
And the first to say be happy if you can
But when you lie and hurt someone who needs and loves you so
Do you mind too much if I don't understand
I suppose that you're convinced this is the thing to do
Life is short and sweet break all the hearts you can
I guess I shouldn't be surprised it's all a game to you
But do you mind too much if I don't understand
Forgive me but it all seems so unreal to me
And my heart and me we'd made so many plans
But that's all over now there's nothing left to do
But do you mind too much if I don't understand
Forgive me but it all seems
But do you mind too much if I just don't understandLet me tell you no matter darling what be fell you
I would love you constantly
Tranquil stormy what ever future lies be for me
I will love you constantly
This world is changing fast
Nothings made that's meant to last
But I will only change I am sure
In a way that means I love you more
Laughter sorrow all on the road we call tomorrow
I will love you constantly
What ever life may bring you here's a truth your heart can cling to
I will love you constantly
Forever is a thing with a strange uncertain ring
And nothings ever set in stone
But my hearts forever yours and yours aloneOver The Hill To The Poor House
1. Oh how can it be they have driven
Their father so helpless and old
Oh God may their crimes be forgiven
To perish out here in the cold
Oh heaven I'm sad and I'm weary
See the tears how they course down my cheek
This world is so lonely and weary
My heart for relief plainly seeks
Chorus:
I'm old I'm helpless and feeble
And the days of my youth have gone by
And it's over the hill to the poor house
I must wander alone there to die
2. Long years since Mary was taken
My faithful affectionate wife
Since then I've been alone and forsaken
The light has died out of my life
Oh me on the doorstep up yonder
I've set with my babe's on my knee
No father was happy or fonder
Than I of my little ones three
Chorus:
3.The boys were so rosy and cheerful
and Lily with chatter so sweet
God knows how their father has loved them
But they've driven him out on the street
I gave them the place where I lived on
A deed to the farm and more
I gave them the house they were borned in
And now I am turned from its door
Chorus:(Christine)-Bruma creo recordar,
En un lago igual que oscuro cristal
Velas todo alrededor, y en una barca que cruzo,
En lago un hombre fantasmal.
TÃº eras sombra en las sombras
Tu oculto una vez mÃ¡s
(Le quita la mÃ¡scara para ver su rostro y el se da cuenta y se enfurece)
(Erick)-Diabla,
Cotilla mala pandora
Cruel demonio, solo esto querÃ­as tu ver.
Bruja, Dalila falsa y traidora,
Di boa innoble, libre ya jamÃ¡s podrÃ¡s ser.
Diabla, bruja.
Amiga mi rostro no te atreverÃ­as tu ni a pensar en mi
Que con el cielo soÃ±ando estoy y preso soy
Del infierno solo aquÃ­, solo aquÃ­.
Oh Christine
Pierde ya el temor, podrÃ¡s asÃ­ al hombre amar, venciendo al monstruo al fin,
Al adefesio tu bestia ruin que sueÃ±a con la belleza, solo aquÃ­, solo aquÃ­.
Oh Christine
(Ella le da la mÃ¡scara y Ã©l se da vuelta para ponÃ©rsela)
Ven debemos regresar, esos dos necios que dirigen mi teatro te echaran en falta.Though the miles are between us I thought our love would strengthen
As it has so many times before
But something has happened I can see it in your eyes
I can feel my world is crumblin' and the blues are at my door
The last letter that you wrote was on a blue piece of paper
That old feelin's back the clouds are moving in
The beginning of the end is near I feel your love has faded
Into darkness it seems I have no friend I feel the blues movin' in
[ guitar ]
Oh it's not the words you wrote that made me sad and broken hearted
That's put me in this sad shape I'm in
Tween the lines are mixed emotions and there's teardrops on the paper
You said that's all I'll write today I'll cose for now old friend
The last letter that you wrote...
[ fiddle ]
My state of mind is desperate and this hole that I'm sinking in
Gets deeper while I'm digging to get out
Oh please give the right answer to the questions I'm asking
Tell me you still love me that would turn my world about
The last letter that you wrote...
I feel the blues movin' in I feel the blues movin' in
[ mandolin - fiddle ]I broke most of Mama's dishes
She banned me from the kitchen when I was a kid
And I tore Daddy's truck to pieces
Left it in a heap that no mechanic could fix
You don't believe me - I can see you laughin'
But trust me, I'm an accident
A'waitin' here to happen
'Cause I break things - anything I touch
I just get around 'em and I'm bound to tear 'em up
Yeah, I make things snap and fall apart
So if you want to hold me boy, you better watch your
heart
'Cause I break things
You say I'm nothin' you can't handle
You're tougher than an anvil
Oh baby we'll see
I'm like a wreckin' ball comin'
You're better off runnin' far away from me
Don't get me wrong,
Now baby I adore you
It's only right that I give you fair warning
"Cause I break things, anything I touch
I just get around 'em and I'm bound to tear 'em up
Yeah, I make things snap and fall apart
So if you want to hold me boy, you better watch your
heart
'Cause I break things
Rain is wet, the desert is dry
That's the way it'll always be
And fire is hot, it's dark at night'The sun comes up in the east
And I break things, anything I touch
I just get around 'em and I'm bound to tear 'em up
Yeah, I make things snap and fall apart
So if you want to hold me boy, you better watch your
Heart
Because I break things
Mmmm, I break thingsWell I changed my ways to please that woman
But I could never be good enough
Yeah, I gave up drinkin' and took up churchin'
And for awhile it wasn't tough
But barkeep I've made a decision after doing the best I could
That for better or worse, I'm gonna be bad for good
So bring on the whiskey
Turn up the jukebox loud
These boots were made for tonkin'
Warn every woman around
I'm gonna wind it up tonight
A little tighter than I should
Yeah for better or worse, I'm gonna be bad for good
I really like my reputation
And how I'm known all over town
Of being the first in my generation
To close every single honky tonk down
I'm gonna be a tough act to follow
Doin' what I said I would
Yeah for better or worse, I'm gonna be bad for good
So bring on the whiskey
Turn up the jukebox loud
These boots were made for tonkin'
Warn every woman around
I'm gonna wind it up tonight
A little tighter than I should
Yeah for better or worse, I'm gonna be bad for good
Oh somebody be badBeen runnin' around, seen many a town
So maybe you'll find I'm the kind of guy to brag
But listen to me and see, if you don't agree
No melody rolls like that old steel guitar rag.
And when they slide that thing along the strings
It sounds so doggone heavenly, you hear an angel sing
An' when you start your feet, your heart will beat
The rhythm to that old steel guitar rag.
You may be kind choosy 'bout the kind of songs you hear
You may like songs that's bluesy, so you cry right in your beer
But if you like a tune that's bound to drive away your care
Make happy your soul with that old steel guitar rag.I know your leaving's too long overdue
For far too long I've had nothing new to show you
Goodbye dry eyes I've watched your plain feet off west to the moon
It felt so strange to walk away alone
No regrets no tears goodbye don't want you back we'd only cry again
Say goodbye again
The hours that were yours echo like empty rooms
The thoughts we used to share I now keep alone
I woke last night and spoke to you not thinking you were gone
It felt so strange to lie awake alone
No regrets no tears goodbye
Our friends have tried to turn my nights to day
Strange faces in your place can't keep the ghost away
Just beyond the darkest hour just behind the dawn
Still feels so strange to leave my life alone
No regrets no tears goodbyeCause your love takes good care of me yes your love takes good care of me
And when the rain falls and the wind blows and the storm is on the sea
I'll be safe your love takes care of me
When life for me gets weary and the sun refuses to shine
I run to the arms of the one I love and there I'll hide
You know just what to do and say you make my life worthwhile
And when I look into your face I see heaven in your smile
And your love...
Oh I'll be safe your love takes care of meLike the sweet morning dew,
I took one look at you,
And it was plain to see you were my destiny.
With my arms open wide, I threw away my pride.
I'll sacrifice for you dedicate my life for you.
I will go where you lead always there in time of need.
And when I lose my will you'll be there to push me up the hill.
There's no, no looking back for us, we got love sure 'nough, that's enough.
You're all, you're all I need to get by.
Like an eagle protects his nest for you I'll do my best,
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me.
Darlin' in you I found strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door.
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher.
I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal.
'Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination.
You're all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more.
All, all the joys under the sun wrapp'd up into one.Oh all I needed was one look
One magic moment was all it took
From that moment I loved you so
Now that I found you
I'm never gonna let you go
Come on say it say it again
It sounds so good say it
One more time and then
Well if you mean it say it again
The hard part's over
And the loving part begins
Oh hold me closer make me warm
I feel wanted here in your arms
I've been lonely for too long
I've waited a lifetime
For you to come along
So on say it say it again
It sounds so good say it
One more time and then
Well if you mean it say it again
The hard part's over
And the loving part begins
Come on say it say it again
It sounds so good say it
One more time and then
Well if you mean it say it again
The hard part's over
And the loving part beginsThis land is your land and it's my land from California to New York Island
From redwood forrest to the gulf stream water I said this land belongs to you and me
As I went roaming that river of highway I saw above me there in the skyway
I saw below me that golden valley I said this land belongs to you and me
This land is your land...
[ banjo ]
I roamed and rambled I follow my footsteps
I crossed golden sands of your diamond desert
And all around me a voice kept saying it said this land was made for you and me
This land is your land...
[ ac.guitar ]
As the sun was shining and I was strolling
And the whitfields waving and the dust clouds rolling
As I thought of lifting a voice was saying it said this land was made for you and me
This land is your land...You placed gold on my finger
You brought love like I've never known
You gave life to our children
And to me a reason to go on
You're my bread when I'm hungry
You're my shelter from troubled winds
You're my anchor in life's ocean
But most of all you're my best friend
When I need hope and inspiration
You're always strong when I'm tired and weak
I could search this whole world over
You'd still be everything that I need
You're my bread when I'm hungry
You're my shelter from troubled winds
You're my anchor in life's ocean
But most of all you're my best friend
You're my bread when I'm hungry
You're my shelter from troubled winds
You're my anchor in life's ocean
But most of all you're my best friendMoonlight's kinda like a spotlight shining down on you tonight
Ready or down low playing one good 'n slow
Setting it up just right
I can hear loud and clear what your eyes are saying to mine
It's about to get real good
Come on baby get real close
Girl you know I want you real bad
Got me falling fast
Let's take it where it wants to go
It's about to get real hot
It's a real deal
Yeah you're kissing me, sliding up next to me
The way your heartbeat feels
It's about to get real
Where this is going is where I'd been hoping
We'd end up at
And if you keep on touching me and telling me you love me
There's no turning back
It feels like it should, I knew it would
We can't miss, are you ready for this?
It's about to get real good
Come on baby get real close
Girl you know I want you real bad
Got me falling fast
Let's take it where it wants to go
It's about to get real hot

It's about to get real
It's about to get real good
Come on baby get real close
Girl you know I want you real bad

Yeah you're kissing me, sliding up next to me
The way your heartbeat feels
Girl the way your heartbeat feels
It's about to get real
Yeah baby it's about to get realYou gotta walk that lonesome valley,
You gotta walk it by yourself,
Nobody here can walk it for you,
You gotta walk it by yourself.
Some people say that John was a Baptist,
Some folks say he was a Jew,
But your holy scripture tells you
That he was a preacher too.
Daniel was a Bible hero,
Was a prophet brave and true,
In a den of hungry lions
Proved what faith can do for you.
There's a road that leads to glory
Through a valley far away,
Nobody else can walk it for you,
They can only point the way.
Mamma and daddy loves you dearly,
Sister does and brother, too,
They may beg you to go with them,
But they cannot go for you.
I'm gonna walk that lonesome valley,
I'm gonna walk it by myself,
Don't want to nobody to walk it for me,
I'm gonna walk it by myself.You ask how much I need you
Must I explain
I need you oh my darling
Like roses need rain
You ask how long I'll love you
I'll tell you true
Until the twelfth of never I'll still be loving you
Hold me close
Never let me go
Hold me close
Melt my heart like April snow
I'll love you 'till the blue bells forget to bloom
I'll love you 'till the clover has lost its perfume
I'll love you 'till the poets run out of rhymeThe sad sun
Shining down on the day I drove to the cape
And a thing that was slowly dying
The sad sun was taken away
Never had your chance to live
And it's hard to forgive
Never had your chance to love
And it does not happen like this
In heaven, if heaven exists
And we'll never know until the moment we're finished
And the few that care
What have they accomplished right here?
The sad sun
Shining down on the day I drove to the cape
And a still thing was slowly dying
The sad sun was taken away
The sad sun was telling me that
You'll never see his light again
All rolling around with no skin
And your wrists cut from start to end
And they're laughing
Clouding your head with bad thoughts
But I'm your friend
And the close encounter
Never happens like this
Never had your chance to live
And it's hard to forgive
Never had your chance to love
And it does not happen like this
In heaven, if heaven exists
And we'll never know until the moment we're finished
And the few that care
What have they accomplished right here?
What have they accomplished right here?Johnny Guitar you wanna feel good
Johnny Guitar you wanna flail
Hop in the car and buddy we?ll ride
A hundred miles to Hell
Johnny Guitar you gotta witness
Son of a gun you wanna scream
In your velvety case you got a mistress
Say, ?She won't ever squeal on me?
Out on the highway of love
We gotta wreck on the road
Out on the highway of love
We gotta roll
Johnny Guitar you wanna feel them
Tires are touching the street
Long as it take you further
Long as it take you deep
Johnny Guitar you wanna feel good
Give her the gas she got power
Hop in the car and buddy we?ll ride
A hundred miles an hour
Out on the highway of love
We gotta wreck on the road
Out on the highway of love
We gotta roll
Johnny Guitar you wanna feel good
Johnny Guitar you wanna play
Swallow your heart, you gotta sickness
No medicine a take away
Out on the highway of love
We gotta wreck on the road
Out on the highway of love
We gotta roll, roll, gotta roll, roll, roll
We gotta roll, roll, roll, rollI've had nothing but sorrow
Since you said we were through
There's no hope for tomorrow
How's the world treating you?
Every sweet thing that matters
Has been broken in two
All my dreams have been shattered
How's the world treating you?
Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day you're away
Though our pathways have parted
To your memory I'm true
Guess I'll stay broken-hearted
How's the world treating you?
Do you wonder about me
Like I'm hoping you do?
Are you lonesome without me?
Have you found someone new?
Are you burning and yearning?
Do you ever get blue?
Do you think of returning?
How's the world treating you?[Chorus:]
Don't you believe I've tried long enough
Don't you just believe it's time
Don't you believe I've gone far enough
Don't you just believe it's time
Lord knows I've tried just to keep you off my mind
But it's no use, nothing works
You just stay with me all the time
All I do is follow you, reaching for you with my mind
Your sweet love is all I need,
And I think you've known it all the timeI should take my time, I know, take it easy, take it slow
Every heartache needs to mend, before you love again
So I hold on for awhile and try to keep this old heart free
And then I look across a room and someone smiles at me
[Chorus]
Oh and heaven help me here I go again
Before I've even had the time for this old heart to mend
Oh I just get over one heartache and then
Here I go, like a fool, falling again
People tell me take your time, wait awhile and clear your mind
Give yourself some time to heal, If you fall be sure it's real
But it seems that every time, I'm almost on my feet
Someone makes me say hello, someone on the street
[Chorus]Just down the street eight city blocks
Right behind the dairy queen and the one hundred and eight bus stop
There's a little house I can see it in my mind
Oh I should turn around but I keep on driving by
'Cause you're there with her
And I don't know who's got it worse
Me, you or her
I've got her number in my book
I've got it memorized don't even have to look
Oh just the thought of dialing makes my heart race
Oh I could call her up but what would I say
'Cause you're there with her
And I don't know who's got it worse
In this game we all play
Who'll be smart enough to walk away
Me, you or her
There are no rings or vows
Being broken or tossed around
Just three hearts all waiting to see
If you wind up over here with me
Or there with her
'Cause you're there with her
And I don't know who's got it worse
In this game we all play
Who'll be smart enough to walk away
Me, will it be you, or will it be her
Just down the street eight city blocks
Right behind the dairy queen and the one hundred and eight bus stop
There's a little house I can see it in my mind
Oh I should turn around but I keep on driving byThe courtroom was crowded the judge waited there
My mother was crying when I left my chair
The sentence were sharpful they cut like a knife
For ninety ninety years folks is almost for life
I dreamed of the whistle I heard the bells ring
My sweetheart was coming some good news to bring
I knew that she loved me and that she'd be true
She said she would save me I'm guilty as you
She went for a pardon or else for parole
I know she'll come back for she's part of my soul
If she ever fails me I'd be mighty blue I'll stay in this jailhouse I'll die in here too
[ dobro ]
They said I was a criminal and to my despair
They sent me to Nashville and shaved off my hair
So come hear my story I'll tell you my fate
I'm serving in Nashville for another man's hate
I just got a letter from Nashville town and after I read it my spirit broke down
It's sad that my sweetheart and the judge would be wed
And here in this jailhouse I wish I was dead
No matter how right folks a man he may be
Bad company will sent him to prison like me
So take a good woman and make her your wife
For ninety ninety years folks is almost for lifeI got something to say
I'm scared and so afraid
Can you take me as I am?
Come what may our blood is all the same
I'm still your little man
He said, "You ain't no son to me
You ain't no son to me
Eight pound baby boy
I bounced on my knee"
No, you ain't no son of mine
You ain't no son of mine
Aw, forget it girls
There ain't no use in trying
Don't expect to get my love for free
And don't blame me
Well, this ain't no fun for me
This ain't fun for me
Oh, boys should be boys
That's how it should be, yeah
You ain't coming home
No, you ain't coming home
'Til you walk the straight line
You'll be out on your own
Don't expect to save your soul for free
When you're the one who turned your back on me
Aren't you a sight to see
Yeah, you're a sight to see
What you call freedom
Makes you look like a freak, yeah
You must get around
'Cause it sure got around
Don't you know that
I can't show my face in this town
Don't think I'm gonna get you up off of me
When you're the one who turned your back on me
Stranger, stranger on the wall
When the neighbors come to call
I just don't know what to say
So I'll put you away
This time I won't leave a trace
I'll fill up the empty space
When I put you, I put you away
I put you away
He said, "You ain't no son to me
You ain't no son to me
Eight pound baby boy
I bounced on my knee"
No, you ain't no son of mine
You ain't no son of mine
Aw, forget it girls
There ain't no use in trying
Don't expect to get my love for free
When you're the one who turned your back on me
Don't blame me
Yeah, don't blame me
Don't blame me
Shame on you
Shame on you
Shame on you[Chorus]
I'm gonna live, laugh, love, just for today
Gonna take all the trouble that
Tomorrow might bring and put it away
Gonna drink every drop of happiness
'Til they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love
I got a buddy that wakes up
Worryin' about stocks and bonds
He's up and he's down and he only smiles
When the market's strong
I spend my whole week's wages
At the dance on Saturday night
I won't never grow a portfolio
But hey that's alright
[Chorus]
I got a cabin in the country
And the tin roof rattles
When the rain comes down
Where the wind through the pine
Helps me unwind
While the world goes 'round
I got a woman that fills my heart so full
That it overflows
And how it gets any better than this
Brother I don't know
[Chorus]
I'm gonna live, laugh, love, just for today
Gonna take all the trouble and put it away
Gonna drink every drop of happiness
'Til they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love
[Chorus]
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna loveShe's a little complicated
She'll make her mind up just to change it
The kind of girl that keeps you waiting, waiting around
She likes to get her toes done bright red
She's always reapplyin' her lipstick
The muddy riverbank she's the first in, and the last out
She's got something I can't figure out
That everybody's talkin' 'bout
She got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
She's sun one minute then she's pouring down rain
And she'll do whatever she wants
And when she moves every jaw's gonna drop
And I do but I don't want her to stop
I want, I want, I want
Whatever she's got
I want whatever she's got
Tell your mind before you thought it
What you thought your plan was park it
To figure out where your heart is so twisted up
Have you spendin' every weekend
And every penny you've been keepin'
Just to figure out what she's thinkin' when you're thinkin' it's love
Cause she got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
She's sun one minute then she's pouring down rain
And she'll do whatever she wants
And when she moves every jaw's gonna drop
And I do but I don't want her to stop
I want, I want, I want
Whatever she's got
Yeah, I want whatever she's got
She's got me hangin' on the ledge
On the edge of a kiss
All I ever wanna do is this
She got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
I want, I want, I want, I want, I want
She got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
She's sun one minute then she's pouring down rain
And she'll do whatever she wants
And when she moves every jaw's gonna drop
And I do but I don't want her to stop
I want, I want, I want
Whatever she's got
I want whatever she's got
She's a little bit complicated
That's alright
Doesn't matter I'll keep on waiting
For whatever she's got
For whatever she's gotShe didn't look so pretty as some other I have known
And she wasn't good at conversation when we were alone
But she had a way of making me believe that I belong
And it felt like coming home when I found her
She seemed to be so proud of me, just walking, holding hands
And she didn't think that money was the measure of a man
And we seemed to fit together when I held her in my arms
And it left me feeling warm when I loved her
She brightened up the day like the early morning sun
And she made what I was doing seem worthwhile
It's the closest thing to living that I guess I've ever done
And it made me want to smile when I loved her
Some of us were born to cast our fortunes to the wind
And I guess I'm bound to travel down a road that never ends
But I know I'll never look upon the likes of her again
And I'll never understand why I lost her, she brightened up the day
Hmm, when I loved her, hmm, when I loved herThe east bound train was crowded one cold December day
The conductor shouted, "Tickets" in his old- time fashioned way
A little girl, in sadness , her hair as bright as gold
She said< " I have no ticket" and then her story told
"My father he's in prison he's lost his sight they say
I'm going to beg his pardon this cold December day
[ ac.guitar ]
My mother's daily sewing to try to earn our bread
My poor dear old blind father in prison almost dead
My brother and my sister would both be mighty glad,
If I could only bring back my poor, dear , old blind Dad"
The conductor could not answer he could not make a reply
While looking at this little one he brushed a teardrop from his eye
"Do not fear my little one just stay right where you are
You'll never need a ticket while I am on this car"Talk me some sense talk me some sense
Put a song of love and laughter on your face
Talk me some sense talk me some sense
Cause the way you're talkin' now is a digrace
I've heard enough o' your talk about the world that is to be
You say it's sick and sinful and then any fool should see
You sing songs of agitation and usin' funny rhymes
The whole new trend and your preachin' friend is a great big waste of time
Talk me some sense talk me some sense
Just call me a illiterate or any other name
But no matter how you bug me up I'll tell you without shame
Don't know where your world is but it sounds quite a mess
But here on earth we waste our time on things like happiness
Talk me some sense talk me some senseThey say the love 'bove will get you at the age of twenty-three
Well I'm not tellin' my age but something got a hold on me
I'm just cravin' some lovin' in the old fashion way
Honey linger near and listen to all I had to say
Why don't you haul off and love me one more time
Why don't you squeeze me until I'm turning blind
If you don't cuddle off and love me like I want you to do
I'm gonna haul off and die over you
[ steel ]
I can feel your warm lips near me hear you breathe so soft and fine
I can feel the matrimony crawling up and down my spine
I don't believe this love will hurt you cause it feels so nice and kind
It seems mighty close to heaven when your love is on the line
Why don't you haul off and love me...
I'm a gonna haul off and die over youOh bird of paradise
Oh bird of paradise
With your plumes of white
With your plumes of white
Did I see you turn from black to white
Did I see you turn from black to white
Take your wings in flight
Take your wings in flight
Over this earth delight
In a San Diego alley
I saw you smile
I was scared of the hunger
Til I realized it was mine(Good time)
Work, work all week long
Punchin' that clock from dusk 'till dawn
Countin' the days 'till Friday night
That's when all the conditions are right
For a good time
I need a good time
Yeah, I've been workin' all week
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
I wanna have fun
It's time for a good time

Pick up my baby and turn it around
Good time,

And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
I wanna have fun

And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep

Oh, yeah, a good time

Yeah, a good timeShe got an unsigned letter from her secret someone
And she fell into the mystery
Words were few and specifically vague
Intrinsic intrigue
But it said everything
When it just read come to me
She`s always been that responsible someone
Safe within her simplicity
But all this cloak and dagger is stoking her heart
Stroking her curiosity
Is plain little Jane
Gonna risk everything
Is she gonna strike the match
That`ll surely light the flame
Is she carrying a torch for love in vain
Is she gonna break the locks
Take a look inside the box
Knowing that she could release Pandora`s shame
Welcome to the game
What`s in a name
She must be dreamin as she boards a plane
And flies into her fantasy
A first class ticket to the city of Boston
Is all she knows of her destiny
When she touches down
Will her feet hit the ground
Is she gonna strike the match
That`ll surely light the flame
Is she carrying a torch for love in vain
Is the gonna bread the locks
Take a look inside the box
Knowing that she could release Pandora`s shame
Welcome to the game
What`s in a name
Is our little plain Jane
Gonna risk everything
Yeah.
Is she gonna strike the match
That`ll surely light the flame
Is she carrying the torch for love in vain
Is the gonna break the locks
Take a look inside the box
Knowin that she could release Pandora`s shame
Oh, welcome to the game
What`s in a nameIt's like I've always figured
You'd be gone from me so soon
A heartache would be the outcome
And I'd be singing this lonely tune
Your friends all tell me you're happy now
And how good she's treating you
It looks to be the perfect love
Well tonight I'll be lonely too
You're only trying to show me
It's no use, the pain's in your eyes
I know you've been so unhappy
Talk of new love, the words are all lies
So you'll go on pretending like always
Well tonight, I'll be lonely too
You're only trying to show me
It's no use, the pain's in your eyes
I know you've been so unhappy
Talk of new love, the words are all lies
So you'll go on pretending like always
Well tonight, I'll be lonely tooOh my Lord, Please don't forsake me
This is your child, I'm tired and sore
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?
I need your love, my soul is poor
I can hear, the angels singing
I can see those pearly gates
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?
I need a place where I can rest
Oh my Lord, I can't remember
When I first said, "Come in my life,"
For I have lived my life in darkness,
My whole world is filled with strife
I can hear, the angels singing
I can see those pearly gates
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?
I need a place where I can rest
I can hear, the angels singing
I can see those pearly gates
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?
I need a place where I can rest
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?
I need a place where I can rest.(Beth Slater Whitson/Leo Friedman)

[From the soundtrack to the movie "The Sadness of love"]
Let me call you sweetheart
I'm in love with you
Let me hear you whisper
That you love me, too
Keep the love-light glowing*
In your eyes please do*
Let me call you sweetheart
I'm in love with youEverytime you add it up are you left wanting
Simple things you just can't seem to keep a hold on
'Cause everyone who said they'd come just left you waiting
All alone facing a door that never opened
Does the pain just get so bad it feels like curtains
Well hold on 'cause it's gonna feel good when it stops hurting
Does the blues have you convinced the end is certain
Well be strong 'cause it's gonna feel good when it stops hurting
Gonna feel so good
It's gonna feel good
It's gonna feel good
When it stops hurting
Has your life gone wrong so long that not much matters
Windows shuttered options closed high hopes scattered
Do the nights get darker longer are they cold
Summer chills then early frost as you get older
Does the pain just get so bad it feels like curtains
Well hold on 'cause it's gonna feel good when it stops hurting
If the blues has you convinced the end is certain
Be strong 'cause it's gonna feel good when it stops hurting
Gonna feel so good
It's gonna feel good
It's gonna feel good
When it stops hurting
Every prayer you've prayed or wish you've made
Is bound to come around one day but that's gonna be one dayYes, you're known by the company you keep
You say you're doin' nothing wrong
I don't believe you are
I'm only trying to help you sis
Before you go too far
Cause I think you're an angel
But folks think that you're cheap
Cause you're known by the company you keep
Please listen to your big sister
I feel I know what's best for you
I feel that I must warn you sis
That's the least that I could do
I'm not accusing you of anything
I know it's fun you see
But you're known by the company you keep
The company you keep keeps you out too long
Mom and dad don't go to sleep until you get home
Sis, you're gettin' in too deep
You'd better look before you leave
Cause you're known by the company you keep
Sis, you're gettin' in too deep
The road of life is steep
And you're known by the company you keepEverybody calls me Bo
I got no money but I hold my row
Some folks say I'm just a no good kind
But I can ride for miles in old boxcar
Smoke cigarettes butts and used cigars
Ridin' the Atlantic coastal line
Hear that lonesome whistle whine
Smell that tar from the Georgia pines
See that big moon roll
Above this hobo's life, is the life I love
Ridin' the Atlantic coastal line
Ridin' the Atlantic coastal line
Well, I had me a woman in Albany
But her rowdy way's made a wreck of me
I had to get away before I lost my mind
As long as this rattler takes me around
There ain't one woman gonna tie me down
Ridin' the Atlantic coastal line
Hear that lonesome whistle whine
Alabama, Caroline Florida, Georgia, Tennessee
This hobo's life is the life for me
Ridin' the Atlantic coastal line
Ridin' the Atlantic coastal line
I make my coffee in a can
This hobo ain't a worried man
Morning sun greets me with a shine
I go south when the trade winds blow
And I go north where there ain't no snow
Ridin' the Atlantic coastal line
Hear that lonesome whistle whine
Smell that tar from the Georgia pines
See that great big moon
Above this hobo's life is the life I love
Ridin' the Atlantic coastal line
Ridin' the Atlantic coastal line
Ridin' the Atlantic coastal line
Ridin' the Atlantic coastal lineThey say that too much water has run under the bridge
That we never can live down the past
That once your love has ended it never can return
But that's not so for we both know that our love will last
High as the mountain deep as the sea tall as the talest talest tree
That's how much I love you that's how much you love me
High as the mountains deep as the sea
[ steel ]
It might be they're just jealous and don't want to understand
That our love will pass the test with room to spare
But it's just their conscience talkin' of their broken dreams and plans
For it shows and we both know that our love is fair
High as the mountain...(Wanderin' wanderin' mhm)
My father is an engineer my brother drives a hack
My sister takes in washin' and the baby bolls a jack
And it looks like I'm never gonna cease my wanderin'
(Wanderin' wanderin' mhm)
I've done a lotta wanderin' early and late
From New York City to the Golden Gate
And it looks like I'm never gonna cease my wanderin'
(Wanderin' wanderin' mhm)
Been a working on a railroad been a working on a farm
But all I got to show for it is a muscle on my arm
And it looks like I'm never gonna cease my wanderin'
(Wanderin' wanderin' mhm)Well, I heard that since you said we're through
You bought some brand new dancin' shoes
That's all I've been hearin' about
All day long day in day out
That's too much, too much information
I heard you fell in love but now he's gone
You love 'em then you just move on
Breakin' hearts everywhere
Acting like you just don't care
It's too much, too much information
That's too much?
I heard that just the other night
You caused a knock down jealous fight
Over just you being a tease
Like you used to do to me
That's too much, too much information
That's too much?
I hear you been telling all my friends
'Bout how you're never coming back again
I know the news is second hand
But it's more than I can stand
It's too much, too much information
That's too much?Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near
Just like me they long to be close to you
Why do stars fall down from the sky every time you walk by
Just like me they long to be close to you
On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moondust in your hair
And golden starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the boys in town follow you all around
Just like me they long to be close to you
On the day that you were born...
Just like me they long to be close to you
Just like me they long to be close to youBarbed wire fence carving out a hillside, cutting holes in the midday sun
Like a postcard framed in a windshield covered in dust
I love the rhythm of an old grey blacktop, 33's just whistlin' by
Steer the wheel, one handed on a two lane, hugging that line
I got the windows down, no one else around singin'
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Freedom is the miles I'm rollin' on
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I hit the brakes for an old New Holland, hammer down and pass him on up
The breeze smells like a summertime hay field's just been cut
I got the windows down, way out of town singing
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Freedom is the miles I'm rollin' on
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
The only way today could get better, girl what I'm thinkin'
Is I can pick you up, you slide in this truck
I can hear you singing
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Let me hear you sing it
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Freedom is the miles we're rollin' on
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song
This is my backroad song
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
This is my backroad song
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
Come on, come on, sing along
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
To my backroad song
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)There never was anyone quite like me
I'm the only me that you'll ever see
From the top of my head to the tip of my toe
Oh, oh, oh I'm special you know
-------
There never was anyone like me or you
Being ourselves is the best we can do
We're priceless and precious for God tells me so
Oh, oh, oh we're special you know
-------
CHORUS:
We're quite unique, a walking work of art
And strong or weak we all have our own special place in God's heart
-------
We're different each one from the other it's true
God never repeats himself, never makes two
Be happy with who you are, God made you so
Oh, oh, oh you're special you know
-------
REPEAT CHORUS:
We're different each one from the other it's true
God never repeats himself, never makes two
Be happy with who you are, God made you so
Oh, oh, oh you're special you knowWell I'm a honky tonk man
And I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl
To the music of an old jukebox
But when my money's all gone,
I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home
Well now I'm living wild and dangerously
But I've got plenty of company
The moon comes up and the sun goes down
I can't wait to see the lights of town
'Cause I'm a honky tonk man
And I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl
To the music of an old jukebox
And when my money's all gone,
I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home
Well I'm a honky tonk man
And I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl
To the music of an old jukebox
And when my money's all gone,
I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home
Hey now, a pretty little girl and a jug of wine
Well that's what it takes to make a honky tonk time
With the jukebox moaning those honky tonk sounds
I can't wait to lay my money down
'Cause I'm a honky tonk man
And I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl
To the music of an old jukebox
But when my money's all gone,
I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home
I'm a honky tonk man
And I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl
To the music of an old jukebox
But when my money's all gone,
I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come homeWish that I was on old Rocky Top down in the Tennessee hills
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top ain't no telephone bills
Once I had a girl on Rocky Top part bear the other part cat
Wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop I still dream about that
Rocky Top you'll always be home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top Rocky Top Tennessee Rocky Top Tennessee
Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top lookin' for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top reckon they never will
Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top ground's too rocky by far
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top get their corn from a jar
Rocky Top you'll always be...
I've had years of cramped up city life trapped like a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a pity life can't be simple again
Rocky Top you'll always be...It sits above the mantle on a couple rusty nails
And it's worth a bunch of money but it damn sure ain't for sale
The good Lord only knows all the stories it could tell
Granddaddy's gun
He bought it new out of a Sears & Roebuck catalogue
And it shot a many shell over the top of an old bird dog
And it backed a burglar down when grandma took the safety off
Granddaddy's gun
It's just a double barrel 12
The stock is cracked and it kicks like hell
It wouldn't mean what it means to me to no one
I can hear his voice when I put it to my shoulder
"A gun's like a woman, son it's all how you hold her"
He taught me a whole lot more than how to hunt
And one of these days I'll pass it on to my son
Granddaddy's gun
He handed it to me on the day I turned 13
With a half-shot box of shells and a kit to keep it clean
I keep a picture in the case of that sweet old man and me
With granddaddy's gun
It's just a double barrel 12
The stock is cracked and it kicks like hell
It wouldn't mean what it means to me to no one
I can hear his voice when I put it to my shoulder
"A gun's like a woman, son it's all how you hold her"
He taught me a whole lot more than how to hunt
And one of these days I'll pass it on to my son
Granddaddy's gun
There's a long beard living on the living room wall
That I got with a box call
And granddaddy's gun
There's a shot up stop sign on 49
That me and Billy Joe took out one night
With granddaddy's gun
Granddaddy's gun
It sits above the mantle on a couple rusty nails
And it's worth a bunch of money but it damn sure ain't for saleNow I don't care if I'm not the first love you've known
Just so I'll be the last
Now I don't care if I'm not the first one you've kissed
Darling I'll never ask
Yesterday's gone just love me from now on
Be true to me forget about the past
Now I don't care if I'm not the first love you've known
Just so I'll be the last
Yesterday's goneTime slips away
And the light begins to fade
And everything is quiet now
Feeling is gone
And the picture disappears
And everything is cold now
The dream had to end
The wish never came true
And the girl, starts to sing
Seventeen seconds
A measure of life
Seventeen secondsHoney you sure do it well
But I don't need it done
I know if I did it with you
It'd be a whole lot of fun
I'll send my regrets
But I won't hedge my bets
I found a real true love
Now I don't need it done
Baby you sure look fine
But I don't need it done
So I won't waste your time
And I'll just move along
I don't mind waking up all alone
I found me one real true love
Now I don't need it done
I don't need it done
I don't need it done
I found a real true love
Now I don't need it done
It's been one long day all right
Still I don't need it done
You say I could stay all night
Until the morning comes
Well it's not easy but
I've got to give up all you got
I found a real true love
Now I don't need it done
I don't need it done
I don't need it done
I found a real true love
Now I don't need it done
Said I better let you runSome glad morning when this life is over,
I'll fly away to a home in God's celestial shore,
CHORUS
I'll(fly away) fly away, Oh glory
I'll (fly away) fly away (in the morning)
When I die Hallelujah, by and by
I'll (fly away) fly away (I'll fly away)
When the shadows of this life have grown
I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison bars have flown
Ill fly away
CHORUS
Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joys shall never end,
I'll fly away
CHORUSBlackbird was in the field and the sun was getting dim
The breeze running through the trees like an organ in a hymn
Thoughts were suspended like a leaf out on a limb
Fire was burning low and the winter coming in
Now some music was playing in the background of the night
Some friends from around came in and they all said things were high
And we spoke of a stranger that we all met on the way
Who said there was danger in those who watch out for their greed
Now the summer is past the grain and the river getting high
It's amazing a month can bring so many things that can get by
The old ways were drowning to the new ones with a sigh
It seems so incredible that sometimes I could cry.Some say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razer
That leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you, it's only seed
It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live
When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
That you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the roseYou've been there all the time
right in front of my eyes
but I didn't see you
And now, I shake like a leaf
now, I can't seem to speak
whenever you're near me
I'm ready for a season of love
I'm ready for a change to come
and I do believe I've been waiting my whole life alone
All just for you to come along
Now I'm here with you
and out of the blue
something new is beginning
but I, I can't explain
why just like the rain
I can't keep from falling
Oh, I'm ready for a season of love
I'm ready for a change to come
Oh, and I do believe I've been waiting my whole life alone
All just for you to come along
You've been there all the time
right in front of my eyes
but I didn't see youTimes were good while they lasted the good times didn't last long enough
Now my times are wasted thinkin' bout what I didn't do enough
Well now I loved you then I loved you true true true
Never was a minute without loving you
Oh times were good while they lasted
But the good times didn't last long enough
Times were good while they lasted
No the good times didn't last long enoughYou cast the spell on me the first time we met
Be wished and enchanted at first glance
Hypnotized by your command let you get the upper hand now I'm living in a trance
Living in a trance in a world of lost romance I never had a chance living in a trance
Captured by your charms living just for you
I was happy in our make believe romance
I never knew then the spell you had me in now I'm living in a trance
Living in a trance in a world of lost romance I never had a chance living in a tranceTeardrops fall, hearts will break
When there ain't no givin', give and take
Every night's a lonely night
When a love ain't right, when a love ain't right
A hurtin' words and little lies
A love will end up, gone, if no one tries
Rainbows fade to black and white
When a love ain't right, when a love ain't right
So, let's keep doin', just what we're doin'
Hold me tight every night
'Cause it's so easy for you to please me
Love comes so easy, when it's right, right, right
So, let's go try every day
Not to let our sweet love slip away
And we won't have to face the night
When a love ain't right, when a love ain't right(Daniel Lanois)
Well I work the double shift
In a bookstore on St. Clair
While he pushed the burning ingots
In Dofasco stinking air
Where the truth bites and stings
I remember just what we were
As the noon bell rings for
Blackhawk and the white winged dove
Hold on to your aching heart
I'll wipe the liquor from your lips
A small town hero never dies
He fades a bit and then he slips
Down into the blast furnace
In the heat of the open hearth
And at the punch clock he remembers
Blackhawk and the white winged dove
I remember your leather boots
Pointing up into the sky
We fell down to our knees
Over there where the grass grew high
Love hunters in the night
Our faces turned into the wind
Blackhawk where are you know
Blackhawk and the white winged dove
We were Blackhawk where are you know
We were Blackhawk where are you knowLast night I dreamt
That somebody loved me
No hope, no harm
Just another false alarm
Last night I felt
Real arms around me
No hope, no harm
Just another false alarm
So, tell me how long
Before the last one ?
And tell me how long
Before the right one ?
The story is old, I know
But it goes on
The story is old, I know
But it goes onTonight in a bar alone I'm sitting
Apart from the laughter and the cheers
While scenes from the past rise before me
Just watchin' the bubbles in my beer
A vision of someone who loved me
Brings a lone silent tear to my eye
Oh, I know that my life's been a failure
Just watchin' the bubbles in my beer
I'm seeing the road that I've traveled
A road paved with heartaches and tears
And I'm seeing the past that I've wasted
While watchin' the bubbles in my beer
As I think of the heart that I've broken
And all the golden chances that have passed me by
And the dreams that I've made, now are empty
As empty as the bubbles in my beerYou used to think that i'll never win
You said I used before I could be get
You tried to make me feel the same way
To you I was just a song that no one plays
Gotta think this so different way and I
know that you don't like that way you
feel You found the all guilt
Gotta shake it so and down you saw
that this time is for real
[Chorus]
Just can't believe that I could've been so lucky
Just can't believe my dream is coming true now you tell that we wanna die
how you know me Problem all is that
you back to Used to ...
You never thought I've entered this way
For me things just keep going up everyday
It's too bad you'll never reband hear like I said
I won't forget how you spread around
this lies so here they're back in your way I'll never forget How you take me down
Cause I knew someday I'll go far
I know that you'll regret all the things you said
Cause you get me now.
[Chorus]
Just can't believe that I could've been
so lucky
Just can't believe my dream is coming
true now you tell that we wanna die
how you know me Problem all is that
you back to Used to ...I know I've disappeared a time or two
Along the way I lost me and you
I needed a new town for my new start
I'm sellin' VCRs in Arkansas at a Walmart
I haven't had a drink in 19 days
My eyes are clear and bright with-out that haze
I like the preacher from the Church of Christ
I'm sorry that I cried when I talked to you last night
I think I'm on a roll
Here in Little Rock
I'm solid as a stone
Wait and see
I got just one small problem
Here in Little Rock
Without you
Baby I'm not me
Without you
Baby I'm not me
I don't know why I held it all inside
You must've thought I never even tried
You know your daddy told me when I left
Jesus would forgive, but a daddy don't forgetI walked one day along a country road and there a stranger journeyed too
Bent low beneath the burden of his load it was the cross the cross I knew
Take up Thy cross and follow me I hear the blessed Saviour call
How can I make a lesser sacrifice when Jesus gave his all
[ piano ]
I cried Lord Jesus and He spoke my name I saw His hands all bruised and torn
I stooped to kiss away the marks of shame the shame for me that He had born
Take up Thy cross...(Eight by ten eight by ten)
All that's left of all our love now is just your picture eight by ten
(A souvenir of things that might have been)
My lonely world is only eight by ten eight by ten eight by ten
I remember the night that you gave me that picture I ought to
I've relived it so many times I remember how I couldn't wait to get home
Put it in a frame and tell everybody that you were mine
Because you were mine at least until someone else came along
And took you off out of my sight
It's a good thing that you did leave me your picture to hold
Because now I can cry on your shoulder every night
(Eight by ten eight by ten) my lonely world is only eight by ten
It's awful to be jealous of an old picture frame
But I'm jealous of anything that's close to you
And that picture frame seems to be holding you pretty tight
That looks like more than I'll ever do
I wish that I could just be the glass in that frame
And be so close to the lips that I love
I am glad that I've at least got your picture to hold
But sometimes it's just not enough
(Eight by ten eight by ten) my lonely world is only eight by tenGrandpa Campbell would sit upon his front porch
And I'd be right there just sittin' on his knee
He'd tell stories about love and feast and famine
And I'd hang onto every word that he would breathe
He'd say boy as you walk through this life
Here's a little wisdom that'll help you get by
[Chorus]
You gotta live to learn
You gotta crash and burn
You gotta make some stances
And take some chances
You gotta live and love
And take all life has to give
You gotta live and learn
So you can learn to live
Well I left home and I went to carolina
I didn't sail off just to see what I could see
I did some things that I wasn't really proud of
Sometimes life just got the best of me
But I'd always think back to those days
And I know what grandmpa campbell would say
He'd say
[Chorus]
After years of running round and searching
I found me a woman who loves me just for me
All those mistakes I thought that I was making
Led me right here to you sittin' on my knee
Son as you walk through this life
Here's a little wisdom that will help you get by
You gotta live to learn
You gotta crash and burn
You gotta make some stances
And take some chances
You gotta live and love
And take all life has to give
You gotta live and learn
You gotta live and learn
So you can learn to live
Learn to liveLast night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand.
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine.
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, "I need you!"
"Take me away from here and be my man."
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.
Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a guy with a drink in his hand.
He had bay blue eyes, coal black hair
And a smile that a girl understands.
Then he came and sat down at my table,
And as he placed his hands over mine,
I found my self wanting to kiss him
For temptation was flowing like wine.
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and he whispered, "I need you!"
"Let me take you away and be your man."
Then I looked into his eyes and I saw it:
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.I've been all wound up, twisted and tied
Tangled in a mess since I met your eyes
But the more we pull apart the harder we collide
When we come back around
It's a good burn, a sweet sting
Strung up tight like a guitar string
I don't know quite what to call this thing
But it's kinda like the sound of a
Rubberband, rubberband
Stretch it out as far as we can
Rubberband, rubberband
Snap back together again hey
When you knock on my door looking like that
With your cinnamon skin and your hair pulled back
Can't fight the urge, fight the fact
Baby won't you come on in
And we'll spend the night, get all wild
Let loose for a little while
When you leave in the morning with a wink and a smile
It tightens up again
Oh here we go again yeah, yeah
Rubberband, rubberband
Stretch it out as far as we can
Rubberband, rubberband
Snap back together again
Rubberband, rubberband
Bound to get a little outta hand
Rubberband, rubberband
Snap back, snap back, snap back now
Yeah rubberband, rubberband
Stretch it out as far as we can
Rubberband, rubberband
Snap back together again

Bound to get a little outta hand
Rubberband, rubberband
Snap back, snap back, snap back nowWell, I figure myself a mighty luck man with the simple few things I've got
There's money in the pockets of these old wore out jeans
I've got a trailer house and a lot
My wife's good lookin' and a heck of a cook and she does her best to satisfy
I've got a little bitty boy he's my pride and joy
And a happiness that money can't buy
Well I owe everything that I've got the the Lord he's delt me a mighty good hand
And I owe a lotta people in a lot of different ways for making me what I am
But the one thing that I'm most thankful for I guess it was a stroke of good luck
Is when the Lord looked down on this great big world and made those horses that buck
Well, I wonder what my life would be like today if not for them buckin' old broncs
I guess I'd be tied to desk and a phone or workin' at some old gas pumps
Well I know that I can't ride forever but I'll do it just as long as I can
Cause it's live for today forget about tomorrow life of a rodeo man
Well I owe everything...
When the Lord looked down on this great big world
And made those horses that buckOh maria hands it out
She comes from Guatemala
She helps me get around
She helps when I'm in trouble
When the ice cream hit the ground
The federales they were a'coming
She had made arrangements with a vendor
The stupid gringo - he got away
Now if I had a $100's
And maracas in my hand
I'd shake them for maria
I'd pressure her old man
To let me take her back to texas
In the white pickup truck
Where she had done a dozen favors
To get me out of dutch
La...
Now we never spank the children
And the house is pretty small
And I never learned the language
Of old guatamal
But there are frijoles when I'm hungry
And I drink tequila when I'm dry
And the coffee is oh so good
And maria hands it out
La...If we had a date, let's say about eight
Honey do you think it's wrong
If I held you tight in the pale moonlight
Honey do you think it's wrong
If a car would stall, wouldn't go at all
Honey do you think it's wrong
Would your mother scold, if her baby got cold
Honey do you think it's wrong
Oh gee, oh me
Are we having fun
Oh gee, oh me
Here comes your daddy with a gun
If I marry you like you want me to
Honey do you think it's wrong
If you don't mind, I'm not that kind
Crank it up and let's go home
If we had a date, let's say about eight
Honey do you think it's wrong
If I held you tight in the pale moonlight
Honey do you think it's wrong
If a car would stall, wouldn't go at all
Honey do you think it's wrong
Would your mother scold, if her baby got cold
Honey do you think it's wrong
Oh gee, oh me
Are we having fun
Oh gee, oh me
Here comes your daddy with a gun
If I marry you like you want me to

I wear him like a scar
I wear him like a hangover
that ain't worn off so far
I pour him cups of coffee
I take him in my dreams
I talk to him like he's still here
but you won't ever see him
'Cause he ain't comin' back
happy where he's at
I'm livin' in the past
and he ain't comin' back
The mirror tells a story
that I don't want to hear
The reflection of a broken girl
has never been more clear
I found his favorite t-shirt
that's a good excuse to call
but there's nothin' here that he wants
when he left he took it all
He ain't comin' back
happy where he's at
oh, I'm livin' in the past
he ain't comin' back
I know what I did wrong
and I wish he'd come back home
but he ain't comin' back
happy where he's at
I'm livin' in the past
and he ain't comin' backEvery time I hear a fiddle and it's cookin' just a little
Well it makes me want to jump up and run
And if he's sawing with some soul boogie woogie rock n' roll
Well I know I'm gonna have some fun
And when the rosin starts to fly and I'm looking in the eye
Like I'm just about to blow a fuse
Mama call the doctor 'cause your boy has got
The rocking Boogie Woogie Fiddle Country Blues
I met a man from Tenessee this is what he said to me
He said music is a rhapsody
He picked up his violin stuck it underneath his chin
And started playing me a symphony
I said that ain't the way it's done let me see that fiddle son
And I sawed him off a chorus or two
He said you'd better call the doctor 'cause I think I've got
The rocking Boogie Woogie Fiddle Country Blues
Now if you want to play me some fiddle
I'll tell you right from the start
You'd better play me something lowdown hoedown honking
I don't want to hear no funeral march
It's got to pick me up and roll me over
It's got to make me want to jump up and sing
If it ain't buzzing like a beehive, kick it into overdrive
Or it don't mean a doggone thing
So let me rosin up my bow and I think I can show you
The way I like to play this thing
Let's put some boogie rhythm in it kick it on up to the limit
I'm gonna' put some fire on these strings
And if you feel your feet start moving to the beat
And you feel like you've got ants in your shoes
Well you'd better call the doctor 'cause you've probably got
The rocking Boogie Woogie Fiddle Country BluesHow many arms have held you
And hated to let you go
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know
How many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know
So always make me wonder
Always make me guess
And even if I ask you darling
Don't confess
Just let it remain me and your secret
But darling I love you so
No wonder, no wonder I wonder
No, I really don't want to knowYou are my lucky star
I saw you from afar
Two lovely eyes at me they were gleaming
Beaming I was star struck
You're all my lucky charms I'm lucky in your arms
You've opened heaven's portal here on earth for this poor mortal
You are my lucky star
You are my lucky star
I saw you from afar
If Garbo is a glamorous creature
You're a four star feature
Though you are never seen
Up on a movie screen
You are my Shearer, Crawford, Hepburn, Harlow and my Garbo
You are my lucky starRight now gonna take you in my arms
Hold you closer and tighter than I ever have
I'm gonna say all the things that I thought could wait
Now I realize that later could be a little too late
Baby let's love like there's no tomorrow
Live for every moment
Laugh at least a little everyday
If we see the sun rise in the morning
Is impossible to say
So let's love like there's no tomorrow
Today
From now on on every time we kiss
It's gonna mean
So much more when I touch your lips
When I give myself to you
Baby I won't hold nothin' back
Cause there's nothin' I wouldn't give
To make every minute last
Baby let's love like there's no tomorrow
Live for every moment
Laugh at least a little everyday
If we see the sun rise in the morning
Is impossible to say
So let's love like there's no tomorrow
Today
Baby let's love like there's no tomorrow
Live for every moment
Laugh alittle everyday
If we see the sun rise in the morning
Is impossible to say
So let's love like there's no tomorrow
TodayLooking in the mirror
Must be harder than you thought
Truth is not a pretty sight to see
Cheatin' ain't worth cheatin' honey
When you're gettin' caught
Lovin' him while losin' you and me
Maybe I was foolish
Sometimes dreamers often are
I believed that you believed in me
Standing in love's quick sand honey
Reaching for a star
Looking for your love to set me free
I've seen all the dreams
I ever thought was coming true
Shattered like a mirror in your hall
Leaving your reflection like a four letter word
Fading quickly from some bathroom wall
Trying to understand love
Is the hardest part of all
Does it really matter whose to blame
Once I called you honey
Now I never call at all
Knowing you could only call me namesNo, nobody, nobody ever died of a broken heart
It must've hit you like a hurricane
Now you're swimmin' with a ball and chain
Sweet love's gone down the drain
Down, down
Girl you're lookin' like a walkin' dead
You need to drag a brush across that head
The crack of noon and you're still in bed
Wake up, straighten up, put on your makeup
No, nobody, nobody ever died of a broken heart
No, nobody, nobody ever died of a broken heart
You cut his head out of every picture
From the letters where he said that he missed you
All his memories, well you can kiss 'em
Bye, bye
When enough is for sure enough
It's time to shake it out and shake it up
Get in the middle of a great big love
Wham-bam thank you ma'am, baby here we go again
No, nobody, nobody ever died of a broken heart
No, nobody, nobody ever died of a broken heart
Nobody ever died of a broken heart
Nobody ever died of a broken heartI've got this habit I've got to kick
Medicine I need just starts to make me sick
Shoulders I lean on start to be a crutch
Babe I think I needed you a little much
But I'm getting stronger, stronger, stronger
I get just a little bit stronger every day
I'm getting stronger, stronger, stronger
I get just a little bit stronger every day
You showed me the ropes but there were these strings
Tied around my hopes unraveling
So I took the loose ends and I made a vest
To cover up this precious thing inside my chest
And I'm getting stronger, stronger, stronger
I'm getting just a little bit stronger every day
I'm getting stronger, stronger, stronger
I'm getting just a little bit stronger every day
And the hole I never thought would fill
Started to spill
I'm getting stronger, stronger, stronger
I get just a little bit stronger every day
I'm getting stronger, stronger, stronger
I get stronger the further you are away
I had this problem but I've got it licked
I learned to tell the difference between a miracle and a magic trickThrough that green field, through yellow flowers
Over that hill, lies a heavenly lake
Her beauty inspires me, it makes me feel calm
Much like being wrapped up, baby in your arms
But everybody knows, that happy ever after
Has valleys of darkness, has snow capped mountains
Everybody knows, there are beaches on shores
That somehow disappear in the eye of the storm
You asked me a question, I gave you an answer
You're all I want and more
And if happy ever after, means fighting some battles
Baby you're worth fighting for
I believe in love songs, and I believe in pain
I believe in sunsets, I believe on rainy days
I believe in your presence, that I am a better man
Then I'd ever be, without you here
But everybody knows, that happy ever after
Has valleys of darkness, has snow capped mountains
Everybody knows, there are beaches on shores
That somehow disappear in the eye of the storm
You asked me a question, I gave you an answer
You're all I want and more
And if happy ever after, means fighting some battles
Baby you're worth fighting forCC Waterback one tequila sunrise
One's for my aching head the other's for my bloodshot eyes
Last night I let it all hang out I guess that's how my head got sore
CC Waterback I can't stand the pain no more
Last night we got invited to a party at the Jones' place
For fun and games and booze and things I guess I must drunk a case
But that lady of mine drank warm red wine til she couldn't even find the door
She wound up on the Jones' bed and I wound up on the floor

Summer's almost gone yes winter's comin' on
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
Papa writes to Johnny but Johnny can't come home
Johnny can't come home no Johnny can't come home
Papa writes to Johnny but Johnny can't come home
Cause he's been on this chain gang too long
I've laid around and played around...
High sheriff and police ridin' after me
Ridin' after me yes they're comin' after me
High sheriff and police ridin' after me
And I feel like I've gotta travel on

Want to see her bad oh want to see her bad
Want to see my honey want to see her bad
She's the best gal this poor boy ever had

And I feel like I've gotta travel onA little white house, in the heart of town
On a little sad street, just a little run down
Became a home, for Bill and Sue
Two newlyweds, who did the best that they could do
And when they brush each other, passin' in the hall
Sue would smile and say, "This place is pretty small"
"But you know, love grows best in little houses
With fewer walls to separate
Where you eat and sleep so close together
You can't help but communicate
Oh, and if we had more room between us, think of all we'd miss
Love grows best, in houses just like this"
Before too long, Sue and Bill
Were makin' plans, for Jack and Jill
Oh, happy day, when the news came in
But what to do, when they found out Sue was having twins
When they could not pass each other in the hall
Well, Sue would smile and say, "This place is really, really small"
"But you know, love grows best in little houses
With fewer walls to separate
Where you eat and sleep so close together
You can't help but communicate
Oh, and if we had more room between us, think of all we'd miss
Love grows best, in houses just like this"
That little white frame house still keeps them warm
Though it's been thirty-two years, since the kids were born
And when they look back now, they hold each other tight
And whisper in each other's ears, "You know you were right"
"Because love grows best in little houses
With fewer walls to separate
Where you eat and sleep so close together
You can't help but communicate
Oh, and if we had more room between us, think of all we'd miss
Love grows best, in houses just like this
Yeah, love grows best, in houses just like this"This train is bound for glory this train this train is bound for glory this train

Even now some times you feel so near
And I still see your face like it was yeasterday
It`s strange how the days turned into years
Years of hanging on the dreams are already gone
Dreams of wishing you were here
After all this time you`d think I wouldn't cry
It`s just that I still love you after all theses years
Night time gentaly falls another day is gone
I turn around to find your still not here
I leave the hall light on
in case you come back home
But I've been saying that for years
Years of hanging on to dreams are already gone
It`s a wishing you were here
After all this time you`d think I wouldn't cry
It`s just that I still love you after all theses years
After all theses yearsBack through the years I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of
As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
"Perhaps this coat will brang you good luck and happiness"
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss
My coat of many colors that my momma made for me
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money oh I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my momma made for me
So with patches on my britches, holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
and my coat of many colors my momma made for me
And oh I couldn't understand that for I thought I was rich
And then I told them of the love my momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story momma told me while she sewed
And why my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes
They didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
One is only poor only if you choose to be
It is true we had no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors momma made for me
Made just for meI'm not in your town to stay said a lady old and gray
To the warden of the penitentiary
I'm not in your town to stay and I'll soon be on my way
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail
(Yes warden I'm just here to get my baby out of jail)
I tried to raise him right and I prayed both day and night
That he'd never follow the footsteps of his dad
I have searched both far and wide and I feared that he had died
Now at last I found my baby here in jail
(Yes warden at last I found my baby here in jail)
It was just five years today since my husband passed away
He was found beneath the snow so cold and white
Made a vow to keep his ring his golden watch and his chain
But the county laid my husband in the ground
(Yes warden the county laid my husband in the ground)
I will pawn you my watch I will pawn you my chain
I will pawn you my golden diamond ring
I will wash all your clothes I will scrub all your floors
If that will get my baby out of jail
(Yes warden if that will get my baby out of jail)
Then we heard the warden say to that lady old and gray
I will bring your baby boy to your side
Two big iron gates swung wide apart she held her darlin' to her heart
She kissed her baby boy and then she died
(Yes smiling in the arms of her darling boy she died)I know it's late I know you're weary I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are both of us lonely longing for shelter from all that we see
Why should we worry no one will care girl look at the stars so far away
We've got tonight who needs tomorrow we've got tonight babe why don't you stay
Deep in my soul I've been so lonely all of my hopes fading away
I've longed for love like everyone else does I know I'll keep searching even after today
So there it is girl I've said it all now and here we are babe what can you say
We've got tonight who needs tomorrow we've got tonight babe why don't you stay
I know it's late I know you're weary I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are both of us lonely so lonely
We've got tonight who needs tomorrow let's make it last let's find the way
Turn out the lights come to my hand now we've got tonight babe why don't you stayHere you're standing at my door again
I wish this night would never end
But now you say that you've got different plans
I still don't understand
Girl, you don't have to be afraid
I'm not here to take your heart away
I got a million reasons why you should stay
I could go on and on and on all night
I don't know why you'd want to leave
'Cause I believe
Right here beside me is the best place for you
The best place for you would be
Right here beside me is the best place for you
The best place for you to be
You find it hard to look me in the eye
Must make it easier to say goodbye
What would it hurt if you stayed the night
I'd love to see you in the morning light
When it comes to you, I cant get enough
You're all that I'm thinkin' of
If you want it, girl, you've got my love
It goes on and on and on for life
Right here beside me is the best place for you
The best place for you would be
Right here beside me is the best place for you
The best place for you to be
I don't know why you'd want to leave
'Cause I believe
Right here beside me is the best place for you
The best place for you would be
Right here beside me is the best place for you
The best place for you to be
Right here beside me is the best place for you
The best place for you would be
Right here beside me is the best place for you
The best place for you to beWell here we again me and my friends on a Friday night
Waitin' on Jimmy he's always gotta get his hair just right
Bobby yells where we gonna go

Where the girls are where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and the games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a heart where the girls are
Pile three in my truck the rest will follow us and we'll head downtown
Ah we all know the drill hit Jack and Jill's then the Cavalier Lounge

Kiss and a heart where the girls are
If we gotta cross the county line
Oh you can bet we're gonna find
Where the girls are where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and the games begin

Star of wonder star so bright
This one wish I wish tonight
If I'm to live till morning's light
Please don't serve beans on Christmas night
Cook up a steak or toss some greens
But don't bake those powerful beans
Cause if I take one single bite
We won't have a silent night
And my poor dog will howl and bay
And pray that foul bouquet
Will go away
Though he will know from whence it came
I hope it's him my guests will blame
So don't serve beans
Please don't serve beans
Cook up a steak or toss some greens
If I'm to live till morning's light
Please don't serve beans on Christmas night
CTJ
Uh thank you.
Thank you so much
I appreciate it
Thank you
Mmm huh thank you.I hoped I wouldn't miss you long
But I still can't believe you're gone
And I still miss you just as much as always
I hoped I'd get you off my mind
It's been a long time but I find
That I still think of you as much as always
As much as always, as much as always
Just as much as always
As much as always just as much as always
I still miss you, still think of you
Just as much as always, as much as always
Just as much as always
I still want you, still need you
Just as much as always
I hoped that I'd find someone else
But there's too much of you still left
And I still love you , just as much as always
I hoped that I'd forget your touch
But I still want it just as much
And I still need it just as much as always
As much as always, as much as always
Just as much as always
As much as always, just as much as always
I still miss you, still think of you
Just as much as always
As much as always, just as much as always
I still love you, oh I do love you

I still love you, still want you, just as much as always
As much as always, just as much as always
I still need you still love you
Just as much as alwaysOn Saturday night when our work is done
We load our music up on the run
Heavy traffic ahead, heavy traffic ahead
We got to ramble, ramble, there's heavy traffic ahead
We pull out of Nashville right on time
The Bluegrass special heads down the line
Heavy traffic ahead, heavy traffic ahead
We got to ramble, ramble, there's heavy traffic ahead
We traveled around from state to state
The Bluegrass boys are never late
Heavy traffic ahead, heavy traffic ahead
We got to ramble, ramble, there's heavy traffic ahead
Late in the evening about sundown
You know we've come from some other town
Heavy traffic ahead, heavy traffic ahead
We got to ramble, ramble, there's heavy traffic aheadStanding on the corner
With a nickel or a dime
There use to be a rail car
To take you down the line
Too much beer and whiskey
To ever be employed
And when I got to Nashville
It was too much soldiers joy
Wasted on the wayside
Wasted on the way
If I don't go tomorrow
You know I'm gone today
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Black highway all night ride
Watching the times fall away to the side
Clear channel way down low
Is comin' in loud and my mind let go
Peaches in the summertime
Apples in the fall
If I can't have you all the time
I won't have none at all
Oh, I wish I was in Frisco
In a brand new pair of shoes
'Cause I'm sittin' here in Nashville
With Norman's Nashville blues
So come all you good time rounders
Listenin' to my sound
And drink a round to Nashville
Before they tear it down
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Hard weather, drivin' slow
Buggies and the hats in town for the show
Oh darlin', the songs they played
All I got left is the love we made
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were minePrefer the fiddle to the violin
And I tend to think that supermodels are too thin
And I think who you are is who you oughtta be
But that's just me
The best of Andy Griffith was in black and white
Fishin' still beats workin' if you never get a bite
And coffee's kinda pointless without caffeine
But that's just me
[Chorus]
And I believe in little that I hear and only half of what I see
And I believe that living by the book is harder than it used to be
And I'm convinced that lovin' you
Is gonna be the secret to my longevity
But that's just me
I've never seen a place that I like more than home
When I go to the movies, I don't take a telephone
And I'll buy the gas, but you oughta get the air for free
But that's just me
I've never been to Mars, but I'm a man
And I accept the fact that women are just hard to understand
I think people take themselves too seriously
But that's just me
[Chorus]
Hey, that's just me
That's just meI reached out my arms and I touched you with soft words I whispered your name
I held you right on the tip of my fingers but that was as close as I came
My eyes had a vision of sweet lips yeelding beneath my command
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands but I let it slip right through my hands
Somebody took you when I wasn't looking and I should have known from the start
It's a long long way from the tip of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart to the love hidden deep in your heart
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands but I let it slip right through my handsIt's the same ol story all over the world
From bangkok to Birmingham, boy meets girl
He's a wild seed, got hell to raise
She's about to put him in his place
Boys will be boys, when girls will let them
It's a fact of life, don't you forget 'em
'cause the hand that rocks the cradle
Rules the world when you upset them
Boys will be boys, when girls will let them
Now you can hear him bragging, but he's just blowing smoke
Says he's the king of his castle but she knows it's a joke
He's a jester when his friends are around
She's the one who really wears the crown
Boys will be boys, when girls will let them
It's a fact of life, don't you forget 'em
'cause the hand that rocks the cradle
Rules the world when you upset them
Boys will be boys, when girls will let them
Well it's the same old story since time began
Love is a riddle men just can't understand
She says "oh baby, you can do what you please"
One little look will bring him to his knees
Boys will be boys, when girls will let them
It's a fact of life, don't you forget 'em
'cause the hand that rocks the cradle
Rules the world when you upset them
Boys will be boys, when girls will let them
Boys will be boys
Boys will be boys
Makin some noise
Boys will be boys
Oh.... play it boys
Makin some noise
They got their toys...A long time forgotten
Are dreams that just fell by the way.
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's living today.
But she never complains
Of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord.
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come.
She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.
He likes the night life,
The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.
When the party's all over,
She'll welcome him back home again.
Lord knows she don't understand him,
But she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a good-hearted woman;
She loves her good-timin' man.
She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.I'll be home for Christmas
Just you wait and see
There'll be snow and mistletoe
And presents 'neath the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
There'll be snow and mistletoe
And presents 'neath the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreamsI wanna go with you
To that other world
The one your love takes me to
I wanna go with you.
I wish I were glass
So you could see through
Then you'd know before you ask
That I wanna go with you.
I wanna go with you
To that other world
The one your love takes me to
I wanna go with you
You take me away
To a world I never knew
But what else can say
I wanna go with you.
I wanna go with you
To that other world
The one your love takes me to
I wanna go with you.
The one your love takes me to
I wanna go with youWell I just got over one case of the blues now I've got another one that I can't lose
The pain of bein' lonely cuts like a knife looks like I'm gonna have the blues for life
Yeah the sun comes up and the sun goes down
The mean old blues will keep on comin' around
Looks like they're movin' right in to stay I'm gonna be with 'em till my dyin' day
Well I'm up in the creek and I got no orr blues keep comin' round more and more
Don't know how it feels but it's been nice not to have to worry bout the blues for life
Well the guy next door really got it made stays every day layin' in the shade
Got no troubles nor brief nor strife never has to worry bout the blues for life
Yeah the sun comes up.An empty glass
That last cigarette
It's closing time
And I'm drunk again
But somehow I'll make it home
And cry myself to sleep
That's how my day ends
Every night for me
Every night I'm in some bar
Pouring whiskey on a heart that's on fire
Forgetting you is no easy thing
Each night for me always ends the same
With an empty glass
That last cigarette
It's closing time
And I'm drunk again
But somehow I'll make it home
And cry myself to sleep
That's how my day ends
Every night for me
Every night I'm in some bar
Pouring whiskey on a heart that's on fire
Forgetting you is no easy thing
Each night for me always ends the same
With an empty glass
That last cigarette
It's closing time
And I'm drunk again
But somehow I'll make it home
And cry myself to sleep
That's how my day ends
Every night for me.
Yeah, that's how my day ends
Every night for meTimes're gettin' hard boy money's almost gone
Times're gettin' hard boy time to move along
Gonna take my true love by the hand lead her from this town
Times're gettin' hard boy we're California bound
Pack up everything we own that won't take us long
Say goodbye today because tomorrow we'll be gone
It's hard to leave this place it's been hometown for so long
Oh but the men can't live with nothing's right and everything goes wrong
Sometimes I drink cause sometimes I think maybe I was born with a curse
Things don't get no better for me they just go from bad to worse
You know I spent my entire life learned my trade and working hard
Then one day the bossman brought some big machines
And next day he told me I was fired
Times're gettin' hard boyIf only love
Can mend my heart
Why do I ache when we're apart?
And if only love
Can make me strong
Tell me how I'm to get along?
So long without you
So long without you
Walking down the street
In a seconds' beat
I can shift from emptiness
To bursting at the seams
Someone passes by
Sad, familiar eyes
And I'm spilling on your answering machine
Wish we were closer
Need to be closer
If only love
Can mend my heart
Why do I ache when we're apart?
And if only love
Can make me strong
Tell me how I'm to get along?
So long without you
So long without you
What if you were here?
Would it change a thing?
We might drift for hours through familiar wanderings
Then needing time along
Time to know our own
Caught up in this puzzlebox
The paradox of need
Need to be closer
Need to be closer
If only love
Can mend my heart
Why do I ache when we're apart?
And if only love
Can make me strong
Tell me how I'm to get along?
So long without youLight in the parlor, fire in the grate
Clock on the mantle says it gettin' too late
Curtains in the window, snowy white
[Incomprehensible] on Sunday night
Ida Red, Ida Red, I'm plum fool about Ida Red
Ida Red, Ida Red, I'm plum fool about Ida Red
Lamp on the table, picture on the wall
There's a pretty sofa and that ain't all
If I'm not mistaken I sure am right
Somebody else in the parlor tonight
Ida Red, Ida Red, I'm plum fool about Ida Red
Ida Red, Ida Red, I'm plum fool about Ida Red
Chicken in a bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child no
Hurry up boys now, don't you be slow
Y'all in a girdle like you was awhile ago
Ida Red, Ida Red, I'm plum fool about Ida Red
Ida Red, Ida Red, I'm plum fool about Ida Red
My old mistress promised me
That when she died she'd set me free
But she lived so long that her head got bald
Took the the notion not to die at all
Ida Red, Ida Red, I'm plum fool about Ida Red
Ida Red, Ida Red, I'm plum fool about Ida Red
Lights grow dim, fire's gettin' low
Somebody said it's time to go
I hear a whisper, gentle and light
Don't forget to come back Saturday night
Ida Red, Ida Red, I'm plum fool about Ida Red
Ida Red, Ida Red, I'm plum fool about Ida RedTiny pieces of my heart
Like confetti everywhere
Hidden sorrows in the dark
You can feel it in the air
The spotlight finds me
I can no longer hide my frown
Say hello to a lover's clown
Distorted mirror images
Turn the good to bad
If that's not the way it is
Why am I so sad?
Strangers laughter is the only sound
Silence from a lover's clown
Girl that's me everybody's laughing at
With a big red nose and the tears and the silly act
Comedy, tragedy, reality
It all plays the same
If you don't want me
Tumbling from the high wire
Without a net
You're saying I'll stop falling for you
But I haven't yet
The spotlight dims and the bigtop's coming down
Curtains o'er the lover's clown
Girl, that's me everybodies laughing at
With a big red nose and the tears and the silly act
Comedy, tragedy, reality
It all plays the same
If you don't want me
Tiny peices of my heart
Scattered everywhere
Like a fool I played my part
But you were never really there
A new day dawns and the bigtop's leaving town
You can say goodbye to a lover's clown
Say goodbyeWe are miners,
Hard rock miners,
To the shaft house we must go,
Our bottles on our shoulders,
We are marching to the slope.
On the line boys,
On the line boys,
Drill your holes and stand in line,
Ã¢??Till the shift boss comes to tell you,
You must drill her out on top
Can't you feel the rock dust in your lungs,
It will cut down a miner when he is still young,
Two years and the silicosis takes hold,
And I feel like I'm dying,
From mining for gold
Yes, I feel like I'm dying,
From mining for gold.There goes the boy from Santa Fe
Who lost his momma in the second grade
Played Romeo in his high school play
He's never been in an airplane
There goes the boy who goes to town
To people watch and just hang out
He likes to sing in the car out loud
With the windows rolled down
And I'd give anything to hold him again
'Cause it still breaks my heart each time when
He walks by my window, oh no
There goes the boy who made me smile
Danced with me down a grocery isle
I taught him how to dress in style
His kisses always drove me wild
There goes the boy
And I'd give anything to hold him again
'Cause it still breaks my heart each time when
He walks by my window, oh no
There goes the boy walking by my side
He's holding her hand just like he used to hold mine
There goes the boy
There goes the boy
There goes the boyBlues go ahead and knock upon my door you can't hurt me anymore
Um-um ain't love a good thing
Rain go ahead and let it rain all night in the morning I'll be dry
Um-um ain't love a good thing
Ain't it good to know love can take away the rain
And make the sunshine again
And ain't it good to know love can take a lonely dream
And turn it into a real thing
Um-um ain't love a good thing um-um ain't love a good thing
Pain find yourself another heart to ache and another mind to break
Um-um ain't love a good thing
Time find yourself another fool to waste and another place to stay
Um-um ain't love a good thing
Ain't it good to know
Um-um ain't love a good thing
Ain't love a good thing good thing
Ain't love a good thingMy lonely heart was waitin'
You came right on time
You soon had me believin'
True love was on your mind
You took me straight to heaven
I thought we had it made
But, baby, heaven was just a stop along the way
[Chorus]
There's a long train rollin'
And a blue moon above
You switched me back, I jumped the track
On that railroad of love
You engineered my sadness
You treated me so cruel
Now I'm just another rider
On your long train of fools
Things kept movin' faster
We had love to burn
Thought we were on the same track
But you took a different turn
And now that it's all over
I ask myself sometimes
How many others have you taken down that line?Come all you rounders, if you wanna hear
The story 'bout a brave engineer
Casey Jones was the rounder's name
On a 68 wheeler, boys, he won his fame
The caller called Casey at a half past four
He kissed his wife at the station door
Mounted to the cabin with his orders in his hand
And it took his final trip to the Promised Land
Casey Jones mounted to the cabin
Casey Jones with the orders in his hand
Casey Jones mounted to the cabin
And it took his final trip to the Promised Land
Put in your water and shovel your coal
Put your head out the window watch the drivers roll
I'll run her till she leaves the rails
'Cause I made hours late with the western mail
He looked at his watch but the watch was slow
He looked at the water and the water was low
He looked at the fireman and then he said
"We're gonna reach Frisco Buffalo'd be dead"
Casey Jones gonna reach Frisco
Casey Jones Buffalo'd be dead
Casey Jones we're gonna reach Frisco
We're gonna reach Frisco Buffalo'd be dead
Casey pulled up that Reno hill
He whistled for the crossing with an awful shrill
The switchman knew by the engine's moan
That the man at the throttle was Casey Jones
He pulled up within two miles of the place
There number four stared him straight in the face
He turned to his fireman, said, "Boy, you'd better jump
'Cause there's two locomotives that are going to bump"
Casey Jones two locomotives
Casey Jones that's going to bump
Casey Jones two locomotives
There's two locomotives that's going to bump
Casey said just before he died
"There're two more roads that I'd like to ride"
The fireman said, "Would that be
The Northern Pacific and the Santa Fe"
Mrs. Jones sat at on her bed a sighin'
Just to see the message that Casey was dyin'
Go to bed children and stop your cryin'
'Cause daddy's still a ridin' that heavenly line
Casey Jones mounted to the cabin
Casey Jones with the orders in his hand
Casey Jones mounted to the cabin
And it took his final trip to the Promised LandDon't ring that bell
Don't sound that alarm
It's way too late
She already gone
She broke my heart
And there ain't no doubt
There ain't nobody
Puttin this fire out
Don't break that glass
Don't run that line
I'm rainin rain
On timeless time
She's gone forever
It's what it's all about
There ain't nobody
Puttin this fire out
You run around
You yell and scream
But it's lipstick, lies
And gasoline
Don't ring that bell
Don't sound that alarm
My world's crashed
Right through the floor
Everything i had
Well it just went south
And there ain't nobody
Puttin this fire out
There ain't nobody
There ain't nobody
There ain't nobody
There ain't nobody
Don't ring that bellWe sure can love each other when we try
Just like in all those love songs when we try
And some nights I love you so much contend to be beside you
And when I finally close my eyes the sun is high
But we sure can hurt each other when we try
We know all the ways to make each other cry
But when we forget compassion and to forgive is too old fashioned
We've let everything worth having pass us by
But we sure can love each other when we try
And I know we'll need each other till we die
And we'll grow old together you and I
Cause we sure can love each other when we try
Yes we sure can love each other when we tryIn the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty I wanna be
In the warm hold of your loving mind
To feel you all around me and to take your hand along the sand
Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind
When sundown pales the sky I wanna ride a while behind your smile
And everywhere I look your eyes I'd find
For me to love you more would be the sweetest thing would make me sing
Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind
[ harmonica ]
When rain has hung the leaves with tears I want you near to kill my fears
And help me leave all my blues behind me
Standing in your heart is where I wanna be and long to be
Ah but I may as well try and catch the windYesterday was judgment day how'd you do
How did you do ?
Were you running from tomorrow when the past caught up with you?
Did you lay down in heaven ,
Did you Wake up in hell?
I bet you never guessed that it would be so hard to tell
Yesterday was judgment day who'd you see,
Who did you see?
Were the multitudes surrounding you singing in harmony?
Did you see familiar faces or were they
All unknown?
Did you get the feeling you were all all all all alone?
Dust clouds (Rollin, rolling on a lost horizon)
White doves searching for each other (searching in the circles of the wind)
Did you hear the riddle of a road without a middle or an end?
Yesterday was judgment day how'd you fare
How did you fare?
Were you welcomed in with open arms? Did anybody even care?
Did you cling to the crossroads, tho skies were blue and clear?
Yesterday was judgment day, where will we go from here?
Did you hear the riddle of a road without a middle or an end?The stars at night are big and bright
Deep in the heart of Texas
The prairie sky is wide and high
Deep in the heart of Texas
The sage in bloom is like perfume
Deep in the heart of Texas
Reminds me of the one that I love
Deep in the heart of Texas
The coyotes wail along the trail
Deep in the heart of Texas
The rabbits rush around the brush
Deep in the heart of Texas
The cowboys cry, "Ki yippee yi!"
Deep in the heart of Texas
The dogies bawl and bawl and bawl
Deep in the heart of Texas
The cactus flats are tough on hats
Deep in the heart of Texas
That's why perhaps we all wear chaps
Deep in the heart of Texas
Deep in the heart of Texas
Deep in the heart of Texas
Deep in the heart of Texas
Deep in the heart of TexasOh I'm so homesick all I do is roam the street
Can't sleep at night can't eat a bite homesick too homesick to eat
I'm so homesick I'm going crazy and I don't know what to do
Too ashamed to cry too sick to die homesick to be with you
Little by little I'm losin' my mind cause I haven't been home in too long a time
But I'll be home soon I'll be home if I have to come in a box
Cause I'm homesick homesick for you
I'm so homesick I'm going crazy and I don't know what to do
Can't sleep can't eat just roam the street homesick to be with youLook at the couple in the corner booth
Looks a lot like me and you
She's looking out at the window
He's staring down at his shoes
She gets another glass of Cabernet
She's searching hard for something to say
He's got that little too late look on his already gone face
Look through each other like a piece of glass
Is that what happens when the years fly past?
Lately I've been feeling like that
Is it time for a coming to Jesus
Baby tell me that won't be us, us
Is that all we are to each other?
Could it be our last supper?
Tell me you're uncomfortably numb
I can't imagine I'm the only one
Is goodbye on the tip of your tongue
Any love left, gotta be some
Why'd you bring me to my favorite place?
A little wine and everything's OK
Are we really gonna end this way?
Is it time for a coming to Jesus
Baby tell me that won't be us, us
Is that all we are to each other?
Could it be our last supper?
You break the bread and you break my heart
You raise the glass as we fall apart
Guess it's time for a coming to Jesus
Looks like that just might be us, us
Is that all we are to each other?
Looks like it's out last supper
Look at the couple in the corner booth
Looks a lot like me and youI'm country
Well there's a little word and it fits me to a t
I don't know how you spell it but its country and that's me.
I laugh when I'm happy and cry when I'm blue
'cus when I'm mad like I'm suppose to do
On a Saturday night I'll have a drink or two
And hollow at the moon I'm country.
I chew tobaccer and spit it on the ground
Talk to the cows when no one ain't around
I'm trapped on the mountain when the snows falling down
Yes sir boys I'm country
[Chorus]
I'm as country as bronc on the western plains
Just as wild and twice as hard to tame
As high on living as a noon day sun, yea
I'll be country 'til the day I'm done.
City folks think I'm crude I guess
You can tell I'm a hick by the way I dress
But that don't matter I'm as happy as can be
And proud as heck that I'm country.
Well there's nothing wrong with city if you like it that's fine
Drivin' them freeways wasting its time,
But I bet you folks in the back of your mind, kinda wish you was country don't
[Chorus]
Come on boys keep singing them country songs who knows maybe we will just
Convert some of these city folks into country folks and they'll all move out to
The country and then the country won't be country anymore. hold on
I just gave you one side to the whole picture because
Country is heart and dust and snow where the winters get down to forty below
And the works is hard
And the pay sure low and it ain't all roses being country.
Hang in there folks don't do nothin' foolish now
You got yourself a nice high paying job air conditioned offices
Yea you got movie theaters right on down the street there
You got yourself a city park too, now that's country
And there you don't have to worry about no rattle snakes biting on your leg
Or no abdominal snowman coming down and tearing off your head or nothing like
That thereI've got a message for you baby
'Cause you ain't done nothing for me lately
If you wanna be my man
Come on baby catch me if you can
I'm gonna go crazy if I don't get crazy tonight
I'm talkin whiskey slamin', dirty dancing, romance and come day light
No matter what you were thinking that I wouldn't honey I just might
I'm gonna go crazy if I don't get crazy tonight
Well I paid way too much for these jeans
And they look too dam good not to be seen
So if you don't want to play baby
I'll go meet up with the ladies
And you know exactly what that means
I'm gonna go crazy if I don't get crazy tonight
I'm talkn' startin' trouble, seeing double, hey handsome you got a light
No matter what you were thinking that I wouldn't honey I just might
I'm gonna go crazy if I don't get crazy tonight
Body shots, French kiss
Hold my beer and watch this
That's what I had in mind
Do you wanna, 'cause I'm gonna
Yeah I'm gonna go crazy if I don't get crazy tonight
I'm talkin' whiskey slamin', dirty dancing, romance and come day light
No matter what you were thinking that I wouldn't honey I just might
I'm gonna go crazy if I don't get crazy tonight
No matter what you were thinking that I wouldn't honey I just might
Oh I'm gonna go crazy if I don't get crazy tonightMy life was empty so blue and alone
Then you've put your hand in mine and I knew why I was born
Born to love you born to love you born to share your smiles and tears
Born to be near if you need me dear born to love you till I die
I used to wonder what life held in store
Then you held me in your arms now I wonder no more
Born to love you...
Born to love you till I dieWhy are you striving these days?
Why are you trying to earn grace?
Why are you crying?
Let me lift up your face, just don't turn away
Why are you looking for love?
Why are you still searching as if I'm not enough?
To where will you go child?
Tell me where will you run, to where will you run?
'cause I'll be by your side wherever you fall
In the dead of night whenever you call
And please don't fight these hands that are holding you
My hands are holding you
Look at these hands at my side
They swallowed the grave on that night
When I drank the world's sin
So I could carry you in and give you life
I wanna give you life
And I'll be by your side wherever you fall
In the dead of night whenever you call
And please don't fight these hands that are holding you
My hands are holding you
Here at my side wherever you fall
In the dead of night whenever you call
And please don't fight these hands that are holding you
My hands are holding you
'Cause I, I love you, I want you to know
That I, yeah I love you, I'll never let you go
No, no
And I'll be by your side wherever you fall
In the dead of night whenever you call
And please don't fight these hands that are holding you
My hands are holding you
Here at my side wherever you fall
In the dead of night whenever you call
And please don't fight these hands that are holding you
My hands are holding you
Here at my side
My hands are holding youFunny face, I love you
Funny face, I need you
My whole worlds wrapped up in you
When the road I walk seems all up hill
And the colors in my rainbow turn blue
You kiss the tears away
You smile at me and say
Funny face, funny face I love you
Funny face, I love you
Funny face, I need you
These are the sweetest words I've ever heard
Funny face, don't leave me
Funny face, believe me
My whole world's wrapped up in you.
And when I hurt your feelings as I sometimes do
And I saw those mean things that we know are not true
You forgive my childish ways
You hold me close and say
Funny face, funny face I love you
Funny face, I love you
Funny face, I need you
These are the sweetest words I've ever heard
Funny face, don't leave me
Funny face, believe me
My whole worlds wrapped up in you
Funny face, I love you
Funny face, I need you
These are the sweetest words I've ever heard
Funny face, don't leave me
Funny face, believe me
My whole worlds wrapped up in youMama, take this badge away from me
I don't need it anymore.
It's gettin' dark, too dark for me to see
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Mama, take these guns and bury them in the ground
For I can't shoot them anymore.
That long black cloud is comin' down
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's doorLove is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire
The ring of fire
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire
The ring of fire
And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fireI hear footsteps in the street below me just an echo in the cold and lonely rain
And my heart breaks with every step that's taken me
As he walk on out to me at midnight train
Midnight train midnight train I know you've always been on time
But just as once I wish you'd pass this town on by
Cause if I had just one more day he might change his mind and stay
And those footsteps would be walking back to me
Oh how I love him with all the love that's in me
Oh I need him more than flowers need the rain
Gentle hands that just held me so tightly
Are reaching out to take that midnight train
Midnight train midnight train
And those footsteps would be walking back to meI just might take to leavin' in the middle of a night
And I might not be here in the morning light
But I'll never stop loving you, loving you
I might move into Memphis on a fast moving train
Thumbin' down some trucker heading west in the fast lane
But I'll never stop loving you, loving you
Just as sure as that Mississippi flows to the sea
I'll run just as wild, love just as deep
I'll never stop loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
I might call from Atlanta for bus fare home
Call you from Dallas to tell you what flight I'm on
But I'll never stop loving you, loving you
Just as sure as the suns sets on that beach in Malibu
I might go round the world but I'll come back to you
I'll never stop loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
I told you when I met you
I would never let you put chains on me
And you never tried in my life
You know that means everything
Just as sure as Manhattan is sittin' on a bed of stone
You know that I won't leave you in your bed alone too long
I'll never stop loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
I'll never stop loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you, loving youTen miles north of Jackson stood a tower, with 100,000 watts of power. In the parking lot after school, the skynard nation rolled the knob to 102.
Chorus: Oooh ridin around the back roads like a fool. Oooh oooh rock me all night long ZZQ.
Going to California, Band on the Run, Southern Man, Fortunate Son, Ride the Magic Bus all the way to blue. Midnight Rider so tired of waiting for you.
Chorus: Oooh. I can grant your requests this one's for you. Yea, ooh ooh ooh, rock me all night long ZZQ.My darlin come to me
Sit you down easily
And rest awhile
Near the soft fire light
Cold as the night
But warm is my heart with pride
Having you by my side
You're still my guiding light
After all these years
Your soft assuring ways,
The rock I lean on,
Saw me through my darkest days
When all hope had gone
You're still the only one
I'll ever hold near
And I still love you
After all these years
Time from me passes on
And I'm growing old
A lifetime nearly gone
I cannot unfold
Night dark and cold
But warm is your hand in mine
Feeble with ageless time
The light of love still shines
After all these years
Your soft assuring ways,
The rock I lean on,
Saw me through my darkest days
When all hope had gone
You're still the only one
I'll ever hold near
And I still love you
After all these years
I still love you
After all these yearsHe saw her after school, sippin' on a coke
Acted like a fool, crackin' crazy jokes
She turned his motor on, man his heart was gone
Fire down below, easy as you go
Easy as you go, steady as you fly
Keep it in the road, keep an eagle eye
Turn it on a dime, man you never know
Take a little time, whoa, easy as you go
Graduation night, out behind the stands
In the fading light he became a man
She discovered love better be enough
Cause baby's gonna grow, easy as you go
Easy as you go, steady as you fly
Keep it in the road, keep an eagle eye
Turn it on a dime, man you never know
Take a little time, whoa, easy as you go
Judgmental frowns, teacher's lookin' down
Parents all ashamed, passin' out the blame
They got a little room, service station view
The rents too high, pay's too low, whoa, easy as you go
Ain't nothing like a daughter or a son
To make a mama old and keep a daddy young
Make a body dream and give a life a theme
Take the highs and the lows, whoa, easy as you go
Easy as you goOh the stars they did shine
The night you swore that you'd be mine
And you promised always to be true and to be kind
On that Shenandoah Hill
Where our love bloomed until
I went away and left those promises behind
But when I rise from the timberline
And call your name, will you remember mine?
And the sweetest kiss will be the tie that binds
Like the wild, wild rose and the columbine
To that place I will go
Where the wildwood flowers grow
With a ribbon in my hair and a grown of calico
To those Shenandoah Hills
I'll go back I swear I will
To the sweetest kiss my lips will ever know
And when I rise from the timberline
And call your name, will you remember mine?
And the sweetest kiss will be the tie that binds
Like the wild, wild rose and the columbine
And when I rise (when I rise) from the timberline (timberline)
And call your name (call your name), will you remember mine? (remember mine?)
And the sweetest kiss (sweetest kiss) will be the tie that binds (tie that binds)
Like the wild, wild rose (like the rose) and the columbine (columbine)
And when I rise (when I rise) from the timberline (timberline)
And call your name, will you remember mine? (remember mine)
And the sweetest kiss will be the tie that binds (tie that binds)
Like the wild, wild rose (wild, wild rose) and the columbineHey I'm just staring out the window, baby don't mind me
But it's been a couple weeks since I walked on something but concrete
This big city's getting to me, I'm having hillbilly dreams
I'm hearing Haggard songs, it's been too long
I'm thinking country, I'm talking hammer down
I mean one arm out the window like Smokey and the Bandit
Kind of good times, it's what I got on my mind
Let's go to Luckenbach, it's what I need
I can't help it, I'm just thinking country
Cane pole stuck in the sand
That's the kind of mood that I'm in
I can't focus on anything else but getting us gone
I got this crazy desire to go out and sit by a fire
Maybe light up cheap cigars, Willy on guitar
I'm thinking country, I'm talking hammer down
I mean one arm out the window like Smokey and the Bandit
Kind of good times, it's what I got on my mind
Let's go to Luckenbach, it's what I need
I can't help it, I'm just thinking country
Yeah, I'm thinking country
So just go with me baby, come on, help me concentrate
I know we're sitting downtown but I'm in some other
You know I'm in some other place
I'm thinking country, I'm talking hammer down
I mean one arm out the window like Smokey and the Bandit
Kind of good times, it's what I got on my mind
Let's go to Luckenbach, it's what I need
I can't help it, I'm just thinking country
Yes, I'm thinking country
It's been a long time, been a long time gone
Been a long time since I've been home
Been a long time, been a long time gone
Been a long time since I've been home
Yeah I'm thinking country, I'm thinking country
Been a long time, been a long time gone
Been a long time since I've been home
Been a long time, been a long time gone
Been a long time since I've been home
Yeah I'm thinking country, I'm thinking country
Oh, I'm thinking countryLooking back over my life I can see where I caused you strife
But I know oh yes I know I'd never make that same mistake again
Looking back over my deeds I can see signs of wise girl heeds
But if I just have a chance I'd never make that same mistake again
Once my cup was overflowing but I gave nothing in return
Now I can begin to tell you what a lesson I have learned
Looking back over the slate I can see love turn to hate
But I know oh yes I know I'll never make that same mistake again
Once my cup was overflowingAnd the oil fields fed our family
'Neath the amber waves of grain
God, He was our savior
Though his name was spoke in vain
My dad would leave for work each morning
In the twilight's last gleaming
'Cause every day I'd awaken
To the American dreamRailroad steamboat river and cannal yonder comes a sucker and he's got my girl
And she's gone gone gone gone and she's gone gone gone
And I'll bid her my last farewell
I fell in love with a pretty little thing I thought that wedding bells would ring
She was as sweet as sweet could be till I found out what she did to me
Railroad steamboat...
I asked her mother to let her go she whispered mother please tell him no
Though he may think that I am true there's plenty more who think so too
Railroad steamboat...
I won't cry my life away some other sucker will have to pay
And when he finds that she is gone I guess I'll hear him sing this song
Railroad steamboat...
And I'll bid her my last farewellI walked half way across this town
Singing in the pouring rain
I knew someway somehow
I had to see your smiling face
Some people need some time
Some people need their space
But when you're not in my arms
You're too far away (for)
The love of a woman
The love of a woman like you
The love of a woman
There's nothing so strong and so true
I prayed to God above
And I've searched my whole life through
For the love of a woman
The love of a woman like you
My friends all ask me why
I lay my heart on the line
But somewhere deep down inside
They know exactly why
When it don't go like you plan
There's nothing that hurts so bad
But when it works like it should
There's nothing on earth known to man (like)
The love of a woman
The love of a woman like you
The love of a woman
There's nothing so strong and so true
I prayed to God above
And I've searched my whole life through
For the love of a woman
The love of a woman like youSomeday I think I'll take up thinking and try my best to understand
How she could be loving me forever and leaving on the other hand
Last night I thought I'd see a movie to help me get my thoughts in hand
I think what I saw was the western preacher or James Bond on the other hand
I placed the ring upon one finger of her left hand
The one who said she'd stay forever is gone on the other hand
(And here's big Jim Talbott and his electric Hawaiian steel guitar)
But today the world looks brighter I feel just like a brand new man
I love her no longer I don't miss her I'm lying on the other hand
She's gone I know I'm being foolish I should act like a grown up man
But things could get worse I could start crying I do on the other hand
I placed the ring
The one who said she'd stay forever is gone on the other hand(Dolly Parton)
When my strength is not enough to face the disapointments
When nothing seems to work out like I planned
When I think I've reached the end, just stop and reassure me
Cause I can make it, if you say I can
If you say I can, then I can find the strength to do it
In knowing you believe that much in me
Tell me that I can and give me faith in what I'm doing
I'm only just as strong as you make me
But I can do it, if you say I can
When I've reached the point of thinking life's not worth the bother
When I can't seem to give what life demands
When it seems impossible to make it any farther
I can go on, if you say I can
If you say I can, then I can find the strength to do it
In knowing you believe that much in me
Tell me that I can and give me faith in what I'm doing
I'm only just as strong as you make me
But I can do it, if you say I canThe one I love is knocking at my door,
With the kind of look I never saw before.
He said: "Hey, baby, you and me.
"Nothin' like knowin' when it's time to leave."
Took a listen to his advice,
Thought about it once but I didn't think twice.
I packed my life in a paper sack,
Don't miss nothing that I never had.
This old car's our limousine,
Ridin' on hope, livin' on dreams.
Don't wanna know nothin' about readin' the map.
We're makin' it up as we go.
Final destination, "Dont look back",
'Cos when you're shootin' the dice, you just tumble and roll.
If we ever get lost, we can use the stars.
Right now, we don't care where we are.
Spin them wheels, gonna get there yet.
Runnin' down the road of no regrets.
We got each other and that's enough.
Ain't we lucky, we got love?
Don't wanna know nothin' about readin' the map.
We're makin' it up as we go.
Final destination, "Dont look back",'
'Cos when you're shootin' the dice, you just tumble and roll.
Got each other and that's enough.
Ain't we lucky, we got love?
Don't wanna know nothin' about readin' the map.
We're makin' it up as we go.
Final destination, "Dont look back",
'Cos when you're shootin' the dice.
Don't wanna know nothin' about readin' the map.
We're makin' it up as we go.
Final destination, "Dont look back",
'Cos when you're shootin' the dice, you just tumble and roll.In the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty
I want to be in the warm hold of your lovin' mind
Feel you all around me and to take your hand along the sand
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind
When sundown pales the sky I want to hide a while behind your smile
And everywhere I'd look your eyes I'd find
For me to love you now would be the sweetest thing that'd make me sing
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind
When rain has hung the leaves with tears I want you near to kill my fears
To help me to leave all my blues behind
Standing in your heart is where I want to be and long to be
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the windRemember when it was fun, to stay up all night long
We stayed out in the sun, until those summer days were gone
Remember dressing fine, for a crazy hometown Friday night
We'd get a little wild, come Sundays we were back in line
Chorus: Remember me I'm laughing..... crazy, young and wild and free
Remember me I'm dancing .......and times are changing but I'm still the same old me
Remember when it was fun, to write a little note to your best friend
About the one who stole your heart , and what was going down on the weekend
Remember when it was fun, to sit around in the pouring rain
To see the one that stole your heart, stand around the field at the football game
Chorus
Remember when it was fun, to ride up and down on the same old street
Getting lost and holding hands 'til you found a little movie on the drive-in screen
Remember when we were young, watching that clock 'til the weekend
Played the radio way too loud and dance like a fool with your best friends
Chorus: Remember me, I drove you crazy and we were wild and free
Remember me I'm laughing and I can still dance and I'm still the same old meAnother sleepless night alone, crazy from this jealousy.
I heard you call her on the phone,
Watched you shave and dress and leave.
Walk the floor and watch the clock,
Knowing that you ain't missing me.
Imagination runnin' hot, and you're right where you wanna be.
Do you think I'm made of stone?
Do you think it doesn't hurt when you leave me here alone,
Leaving me to think the worst?
And when you're out there in her arms 'til the wee hours of the dawn,
Do you think it's all a joke?
Can't you see my heart is broke?
Do you think I'm made of stone?
I'm just barely gettin' 'round,
Don't know how I'm getting by.
All our friends I meet in town,
They just can't look me in the eye.
They all know you're runnin' 'round.
Like me, they don't know what to do.
God, I hate their sympathy,
But I just can't turn loose of you.
But do you think I'm made of stone?
Don't you know my pain is real?
It's the worst I've ever known just stayin' at an even keel.
Oh, what am I supposed to do while you cheat and carry on?
I should leave, I know I should;
I just only wish I could.
Do you think I'm made of stone?
Oh, it cuts me like a knife,
You have stripped me of my pride.
What am I supposed to do while you cheat and carry on?
Do you think it's all a joke?
Can't you see my heart is broke?
Do you think I'm made of stone?(Donagh Long)
You'll never be the sun turning in the sky
And you won't be the moon above us on a moonlit night
And you won't be the stars in heaven
Although they burn so bright
But even on the deepest ocean
You will be the light
You may not always shine
As you go barefoot over stone
You might be so long together
Or you might walk alone
And you won't find that love comes easy
But that love is always right
So even when the dark clouds gather
You will be the light
And if you lose the part inside
When loves turns round on you
Leaving the past behind
Is knowing you'll do like you always do
Holding you blind, keeping you trueOf all the people in this world, why you and I
With lovers here and everywhere we don't care enough to try
Why couldn't all the hurt we're feeling now have passed us by
Couldn't love have picked a better place to die?
And of all the hearts in all the world, why yours and mine
There's so many places love could die, we must leave the earth for a time
Oh, but it's in our hearts and it's in our bed and it's even in your eyes
Couldn't love have picked a better place to die?
Somewhere out there there's lovers who want to be free
Why couldn't love have died with them instead of here with you and me
Oh, but it's pitiful how all these tears won't bring it back to life
Couldn't love have picked a better place to die?
Oh, but it's pitiful how all these tears won't bring it back to lifePlease release me let me go I don't love you anymore
To live together is a sin release and let me love again
I have found a new love dear and I'll always want her near
Her lips are warm while yours are cold release me my darling let me go
[ guitar ]
Oh please release me let me...I didn't even bother to set the alarm
If I'm a few hours late what's the harm
I've been in Mexico, I've been in Mexico
I've discovered how to take it slow
I've been in Mexico
The boss stressed out, so many deadlines to meet
I'm leanin back in my chair with my two bare feet
I've been in Mexico, I've been in Mexico
Still got the sun on my back and then sand in my toes
(chorus)
When I landed in the land of the Aztec sun
I was too uptight and too high stung
But the moment that salt air hit my tongue I felt a change
Nobody ever goes and comes back the same
When she left me for another I was down and out
But there's a little cactus cure I've learned about
I've been to Mexico, I've been to Mexico
(repeat chorus)Mary, sweet wife
How did you end up in my life
Beautiful girl, out of all of this world
You chose me to lay down with at night
Colors of spring are vivid and green
Since I looked so deep in your eyes
All of a sudden, I'm filled with emotion
With feelings I used to deny
Mary, sweet wife
How did you end up in my life
Beautiful girl, out of all of this world
You chose me to lay down with at night
You've given me purpose and reason to worship
Someone much stronger than me
Gentle and tender, and always remember
The little things a man really needs
Mary, sweet wife
How did you end up in my life
Beautiful girl, out of all of this world
You chose me to lay down with at night
As time moves along, I know we'll be loyal
To each other till they lay me down
And when even then, I'll take your memory with me
To hold me when you're not around
Mary, sweet wife
How did you end up in my life
Beautiful girl, out of all of this world
You chose me to lay down with at nightWell I ain't got no honey baby now, I guess she didn't love me anyhow
Well it's Oh me and Oh lordy my, Ain't got no honey baby now
She left me on that early morning train, I'll never see my good gal again
Well it's Oh me and Oh lordy my, Ain't got no honey baby now
Now good girl you ain't no gal of mine, My honey babe done traveled down the line
Well it's Oh me and Oh lordy my, Ain't got no honey baby now
I'll see you when your troubles are like mine, when you ain't got a nickel or a dime
Well it's Oh me and Oh lordy my, Ain't got no honey baby nowOh, the night is growing colder,
And the stars have lost their shine
And I have been forsaken,
By everything I thought was mine
For in the darkest hour,
When the final story's told
[Chorus]
No matter how bright I glittered, baby,
I could never be gold.
You gave up your finest treasure,
For the one you saw in me
But how could I know the measure,
Of all you needed me to be
Though I came with sweet intentions,
More my pockets could not hold
[Chorus]
I finally gave up counting,
The ways you said I let you down
When I fell into that river of no return,
And you watched me drown
Oh I could sparkle like a diamond,
Have silver line my soul
[Chorus]
You looked so high and low for heaven,
I tried so hard to show the way
But though I flew on wings of angels,
My feet were always made of clay
I could come trailing clouds of glory,
But you saw nothing to behold
[Chorus: x2]Why don't you gather round me people, got a song to sing
About that sweet magnolia thyme
Black-eyed Susan made some catfish stew
And papa brought some homemade wine.
All you southern children like to rock'n roll
The TV mamas tell you why
They got it on the boat from Africa
It's that Dixie Lullaby.
Well, Blind Willie Time he had a dime shoe shine
Stand down on Beale Street
And Willie would stop and just to say hello
All the shoes he'd meet.
Why are you so happy said the clean white buck
You got no reason to be happy Mr Time
And Willie would stop and just pop his rag
With a Dixie Lullaby.
So now you know the story of my southern home
With a honeysuckle wine
And if you ever think that you might come yourself
You ought to keep this thought in mind.
All you easy riders better watch you step
And if you're walkin' down below the line
That Louisiana man is gonna get you yet
With his Dixie Lullaby.
He's got a Dixie Lullaby.
He's got a Dixie Lullaby..There's a scar on my right elbow
From a barbed wire fence when I was eight years old
I must have ran a mile just crying in my torn shirt
'Till I heard the words tell me where it hurts.
If there was a scratch or a bruise on my skin
Mama would put me back together again
All it took was her prayers and her kisses
It would heel me just like stitches.
I took Sherry Johnson to the high school dance
But she left early with my best friend
I must of drove ten miles to get my mind off her
But it didn't work 'till I heard the words tell me where it hurts
She could mend a broken heart, fix a bicycle wreck,
Funny now but back then it seemed life or death
I've seen her sew rags into riches
It would heel me just like stitches.Somewhere along the way we drifted apart
As we walked the road of love we lost our way
Now it's too late to start all over for there's no turning back
We lost each other somewhere along the way
Somewhere along the way we neglected one another
Our careless steps have led us to the end
Oh and all we can do now is just feel sorry for each other
Cause once love has died it won't ever live again
Somewhere along the way hey hey we stumbled oh and we fail
Love is not a game for fools to play
We both played and we both lost now we're both sorry and both to fault
We lost that love somewhere along the wayWhen you're feeling lonely, lost and let down
Seems like those dark skies are following you around
And life's just one big shade of gray
You wonder if you'll see the light of day
Behind the clouds, the sun is shining
Believe me even though you can't quite make it out
You may not see the silver lining
But there's a big blue sky waiting right behind the clouds
I've heard it said that this too shall pass
Good times or bad times, neither one lasts
But thinking that your luck won't ever change
Is like thinking it won't ever stop once it starts to rain
Behind the clouds, the sun is shining
Believe me even though you can't quite make it out
You may not see the silver lining
But there's a big blue sky waiting right behind the clouds
Yeah, there's a big blue sky waiting right behind the clouds(Richard Holler)
I am a backseat driver from America
They drive to the left on Falls Road
And the man at the wheels name is Shamus
We pass a the child on a corner he knows
And Shamus says "now what chance has that kid got"
And I say from the back "I don't know"
He says "there's barbed wire at all of these exits"
There ain't no place in Belfast for that kid to go
And it's a hard life, it's a hard life
It's a very hard life
It's a hard life wherever you go
And we poison our children with hatred
And the hard life is all that they know
At the dairyline in Chicago
A fat man in front of me
He's calling black people trash to his children
And he's the only trash here I see
And I'm thinking this man wears a white hood
In the night when his children should sleep
But they'll slip to their windows and see him
They'll think that white hood's all they need
And it's a hard life, it's a hard life
It's a very hard life
It's a hard life wherever you go
And if we poison our children with hatred
Then the hard life is all that they know
I was a child of the sixties
When dreams could be held through tears
With Disney and Cronkite and Martin Luther
And I belived, I believed, I believed
Now I'm a backseat driver from America
And I'm not at the wheel of control
And I am guilty, I am worn, I am the root of all evil
And I can't drive on the left side of the road
And it's a hard life, it's a hard life
It's a very hard life
It's a hard life wherever you go
And if we poison our children with hatred
Then the hard life is all that they'll know
And there ain't no place in this world for these kids to go
Cause it's a hard life wherever you go
Has anybody here seen my old friend Abraham,
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lotta people, but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and he's gone.
Has anybody here seen my old friend Martin,
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lotta people, but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and he's gone.
Has anybody here seen my old friend John,
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lotta people, but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and he's gone.
Didn't you love the things they stood for?
Didn't they try to find some good in you and me?
And we'll be free
Someday soon it's gonna be one day
Has anybody here seen my old friend Bobby,
Can you tell me where he's gone?
I thought I saw him walkin' up over the hill
With Abraham and Martin and John.Hoje cedo eu chorei
Acordei com vocÃª na cabeÃ§a
NÃ£o peÃ§a pra que eu te esqueÃ§a
Pois tudo no mundo me lembra vocÃª
Hoje cedo tocou
A canÃ§Ã£o que vocÃª mais gostava
Parece que vocÃª estava comigo
E por isso eu liguei pra vocÃª
Eu tentei, eu lutei, fiz o possÃ­vel
Mas viver sem vocÃª Ã© impossÃ­vel
Eu tentei, eu busquei outra saÃ­da
Mas o que fazer se sÃ³ dÃ¡ vocÃª na minha vida
Ainda nÃ£o consegui
Te arrancar daqui do meu peito
Volta e vem dar um jeito
Nesse desacerto do meu coraÃ§Ã£o
Eu nÃ£o posso fingir
Nem tÃ£o pouco mentir pra mim mesmo
Ã caminhar sem rumo a esmo
Pois vocÃª ainda Ã© minha direÃ§Ã£o
Eu tentei, eu lutei, fiz o possÃ­vel
Mas viver sem vocÃª Ã© impossÃ­vel
Eu tentei, eu busquei outra saÃ­da
Mas o que fazer se sÃ³ dÃ¡ vocÃª na minha vida
Mas o que fazer se sÃ³ dÃ¡ vocÃª na minha vidaI'm out walking in dark alleys
Searching for shadows in the valleys
You were my Heaven, you were my home
So what am I supposed to do when Heaven is gone?
If the devil don't want me
Where the hell do I go?
If I can't see the light
In the neon glow
If there ain't enough whiskey
To kill the fire in my soul
If the devil don't want me
Where the hell do I go?
I've heard stories 'bout honky tonk angels
Picking up pieces of broken strangers
I'm at rock bottom with a smoke and a sin
When the party is over, then I'm lonely again
If the devil don't want me
Where the hell do I go?
If I can't see the light
In the neon glow
If there ain't enough whiskey
To kill the fire in my soul
If the devil don't want me
Where the hell do I go?
No, there ain't enough whiskey
To kill the fire in my soul
If the devil don't want me
Where the hell do I go?Well, you ain't that old but you ain't that young
You've lived a life but you ain't quite done
All eyes on you everywhere you go
It's all good till you get too close
Girl, you're gonna hurt somebody
Make somebody bleed
Girl, you're gonna hurt somebody
God, I hope it's me
There's an innocence there this time of night
Is it in your words, is it in your eyes?
And your red lipstick like a smoking gun
It could be aimed at anyone
Girl, you're gonna hurt somebody
Make somebody bleed
Girl, you're gonna hurt somebody
And God, I hope it's me
There's a simple truth to the morning sun
Things don't change, they just light up
With a frontier mind and a restless heart
Girl, you can't change the way you are
Yeah, you're gonna hurt somebody
Make somebody bleed
Girl, you're gonna hurt somebody
God, I hope it's me
Yeah, you're gonna hurt somebody
Make somebody bleed
Yeah, you're gonna hurt somebody
And God, I hope it's meWhy will a man go out and cheat what makes temptation so sweet
And it's a shame that neon lights will make a man stay all night
With a girl in a bar down the street
I never meant to be that man but last night I held another's hand
Though her kisses tasted so sweet that's not what made me cheat
So I'll try and explain it if I can
Where where where could I go oh when I needed love you weren't there
And her two open arms offered love sweet and warm where could I go but to her
Please forgive my one mistake and I'd swear it's the last I'll ever make
Let those arms I need the most take me back hold me close
For loving you is a habit I can't break
Where where where could I go oh when you feel the urge to go wrong
The next time I'm tempted when my glass is emptied
Where will I go I'll go homeHe stopped at the bar on his way to the bandstand
To strengthen his courage and weaken his pride
On an old paper napkin he wrote me this message
"When the snow's over, Mister, could I see you outside?"
To look on his face said it's no laughing matter
I nodded and cautiously walked to the door
Clutching my sleeve he said, "Mister, it's Jackie
She left me and said she won't be back no more"
Please sing a love song for Jackie
Sing it on record and on the TV
She's always said you were her favorite singer
And she listened to you 'fore she listened to me
Please tell Jackie I love her, tell her I'm dying without her it's true
Please sing a love song for Jackie
So Jackie wherever you are and whatever you're doing right now
I want you to know this song's for youI bless the day I found you
I want my arms around you
And so I beg you, let it be me
Don't take this Heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me
Each time we meet, love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love, what would life be?
So, never leave me lonely
Tell me that you love me only
And say you'll always, let it be meHe slips on his warn out jeans
She buttons up his shirt
A sleepy smile and a goodbye kiss
And he's up and off to work
He puts in a forty hour week
But she's on his mind full-time
And he'll give it everything he's got
And he's all her's at five
'Cause he's a workin' man
He don't mind workin' overtime
For the trust and the touch of a woman
Come rain or shine
He's got workin' hands
Puts his heart in everything he does
'Cause he's a workin' man
Workin' on a thing called love
Things get fun when he gets home
She kinda likes it when he's around
She's got a honey-do list with a lipstick kiss
Says, "Meet me when the sun goes down"
Yeah, he's a workin' man
He don't mind workin' overtime
For the trust and the touch of a woman
Come rain or shine
He's got workin' hands
Puts his heart in everything he does
'Cause he's a workin' man
Workin' on a thing called love
She could've had anyone she wanted
But she's never wanted more
Than a man who's willin' to die
For the woman he's living for
Yeah, he's a workin' man
He don't mind workin' overtime
For the trust and the touch of a woman
Come rain or shine
He's got workin' hands
Puts his heart in everything he does
'Cause he's a workin' man
Workin' on a thing called love
Workin' on a thing called love
Workin' on a thing called loveI've been known to tie one on and honky tonk til half past three
But the party don't get started til my baby pours her love on me
She's a hundred proof, lord she's smooth
She makes me moan all night long
So I don't need the booze to get a buzz on
[Chorus]
I've tried it all from Tennessee whiskey
To Ozark mountain moonshine
But it's her sweet love that packs the punch
And keeps me higher than a Georgia pine
Mr southern comfort don't come in a bottle
I get a double shot of love home grown
So I don't need booze to get a buzz on
My little country girl makes my head whirl and my knees begin to shake
No I can't walk no chalk line I ain't a talking or a thinking straight
I'm hooked on my baby's love there ain't nothing in a jug this strong
And I don't need the booze to get a buzz on
[Chorus]
I wear a blue ribbon grin every now and then
But I don't need that to get stoned
I don't need the booze to get a buzz on
No I don't need the booze to get a buzz onMama kiss the hurt away yes mama kiss the hurt away
When I was just a little girl I'd fall down and skinned up my knees
But mama would say let me kiss the hurt away then it'll be all better
Well it wasn't very long till I started first grade
And I cried cause Billy pulled my pigtail
But mama just say let me kiss the hurt away and then it'll be all better
Mama kiss the hurt away yes mama kiss the hurt away
This my mama would always say let mama kiss the hurt away
As I grew older and went to high school I'd fell so in love with Billy
But oh then one day Jenny stole his love away now nothing can be all better
Mama kiss the hurt away please mama kiss the hurt away
But I guess I'm too big for mama to say let mama kiss the hurt awayI'm the center of attention in this barroom
Cause I've got the biggest heartache of the year
And each night those swinging doors reach out for me and draw me in
Cause they know each night that I'll come back to wine me up again
Wine me up turn me on and watch me cry for you
Lately drinking warm red wine is all I want to do
And I never know how title I'll wine me up when I walk in
But I don't care cause I'll be back to wine me up again
[Steel]
I'd like to thank to men that raised the grapes way out in California
And I'm hoping this will be their biggest year
Cause scarlet water's all that's left to keep me hanging on
And that's why I'll try to wine me up each day and night next year
Wine me up turn me on...
But I don't care cause I'll be back to wine me up againThere's a valley of sorrow in my soul
Where every night I hear the thunder roll
Like the sound of a distant gun
Over all the damage I have done
And the shadows filling up this land
Are the ones I built with my own hand
There is no comfort from the cold
Of this valley of sorrow in my soul
There's a river of darkness in my blood
And through every vein I feel the flood
I can find no bridge for me to cross
No way to bring back what is lost
Into the night it soon will sweep
Down where all my grievances I keep
But it won't wash away the years
Or one single hard and bitter tear
And the rock of ages I have known
Is a weariness down in the bone
I use to ride it like a rolling stone
Now just carry it alone
There's a highway risin' from my dreams
Deep in the heart I know it gleams
For I have seen it stretching wide
Clear across to the other side
Beyond the river and the flood
And the valley where for so long I've stood
With the rock of ages in my bones
Someday I know it will lead me homeThere's a rumour goin' round that it's lookin' like splitsville between us
But all that talk's just talk
So don't you believe it
'Cause I just got a call from my baby
And she was all, guess what?
We're makin up
Our on again off again is on again
Were makin up
She really wants to make it work
I'm still so in love with her
Forget about everything you've heard
Were makin up
Well I'm the first to admit that the road's been a little bit bumpy
But don't you think for a moment that she don't love me
Take your nosy little nose and get a whiff of these roses on the seat of my truck
Maybe we argue a little too much
Maybe we broke up more than once
Ah but this is the part I loveHand me down guitar, handful of friends
Park in the dark, where the road dead ends
With the trunk popped open and the music blowing out the JBLs
Just popping them tops, yeah we were shooting off like a shotgun shell saying
Beer before liquor, yeah you've never been sicker
Cops were pretty quick, yeah, but we were always quicker
Burning up the road 'til the tank ran dry
Just down home boys staying up all night
Fake ID, worn out boots
And they can't tell me nothing kind of attitude
Got a styrofoam cup, gonna fill it on up with a little bit of whiskey
Just talking that smack, gonna take it out back, who's coming with me?
Beer before liquor, yeah you've never been sicker
Find yourself a girl, get her number, maybe kiss her
Got a pack of Swishers, anybody got a light?
Just down home boys staying up all night
Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah
That four on the floor
Try to leave a little more than a mark on the blacktop
Got the world on the string
We were living like kings of a run down map dot
Beer before liquor, yeah you've never been sicker
Cops were pretty quick, yeah, but we were always quicker
Burning up the road 'til the tank ran dry
Just down home boys staying up all night
Down home boys staying up all night
Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah
Staying up all night
Whoa, yeah, whoaShame shame on you shame shame on you
Took my heart as a token when return it was broken
Hide your face shame on you
Shame shame on you shame shame on you
Took my car and my money tell you girl that ain't funny
Darn your hide shame on you
[ steel ]
Shame shame on you shame shame on you
Ran around with other guys and and try to lie when I got wise
Foolish girl shame on you
Shame shame on you shame shame on you
Took and play your little game you'll find out who was to blame
Hide your face shame on you
[ guitar ]
Shame shame on you shame shame on you
Can you hold your head up high look your friends right in the eyes
No you can't shame on you no no no shame on youThe other night when I come in, so drunk I couldn't see
I hooked my toe in the old doormat and fell as flat as I could be
I had me a little old bottle o' booze (and I didn't have no more)
When I fell down - the cork flew outta the bottle (Plop!-glug glug glug....hic) - 'n spilled it
There's a little old rat in his hidin' place, he got that whiskey scent
He slipped right up 'n he got him a sssshrlp, 'n back to his hole he went
Says back to his hole he went, back to his hole he went
He slipped right up 'n he got him a sssshrlp (he's drinkin' it all) 'n back to his hole he went
He slipped right up to my puddle o' gin and he lapped up more and more
He says "Doggone, my red-eyed soul, I'm a-gonna get drunk once more"
"I gonna get drunk once more, I'm a-gonna get drunk once more
He says "Doggone, my red-eyed soul, I'm a-gonna get drunk once more"
He washed his face with his front paws and on his hind leg he sat
And he's a-gettin' pretty high when he winked one eye and he says ;(hic)
Hey, where's that old tom-cat?
"Now where's that old tom-cat? I said where's that old tom-cat?
He's a-gettin' high when he winked one eye and he says "(hic) Hey, buddy, where's
that old tom-cat? (I can lick him and his brother)"
The old tom-cat come a-slippin' in, dashed over to the middle o' the floor
The cat jumped over and the rat got sober and he never got drunk no more
He didn' get drunk no more, no he never got drunk no more
The cat jumped over and the rat got sober (poor little feller) and he never got dunk no moreYou decide
What you need
And then you let me know
I'll be waiting here until you call
Take your time
Till you find
Which way your heart must go
And when you decide, let me know
Don't you worry if you see me cry
I would rather have you say goodbye
Than to be the one that you say you love
If I can't be the one that you're dreaming of
You decide
What you want
And I'll be waiting here
You already know how much I care
You decide
And we'll just go from there
Don't you worry if you see me cry
I would rather have you say goodbye
Than to be the one that you say you love
If I can't be the one that you're dreaming of
You decide
What you want
I'll be waiting here
You already know how much I care
You decide
We'll just go from there
You decide
And we'll just go from thereI bet you're sick of them pick up lines, the same thing every Friday night
You're so hot girl, you're looking so fine, like you don't already know
They say they'll treat you right, show you the city lights
Get you sipping on something you don't even like
I guess they don't know, they're on the wrong road
I know what you wanna hear
Truck tires on a two lane rolling
River rushing and a warm breeze blowing in
Hair all around to the sound
Of the radio singing in the background
Gravel grinding, while we're finding
A little spot I can make a fire in
Top popping on an ice cold beer
I know what you wanna hear
Ain't that music to your ears?
Tell me, have I got you figured out?
Baby, ain't that what you're all about?
Do I make you wanna leave this crowd and head on outta here
'Cause I can tell by that little shy smile
What I'm talking bout's a little more of your style
It'll only take a couple of miles to the
Truck tires on a two lane rolling
River rushing and a warm breeze blowing in
Hair all around to the sound
Of the radio singing in the background
Gravel grinding, while we're finding
A little spot I can make a fire in
Top popping on an ice cold beer
I know what you wanna hear
They say they'll treat you right, show you the city lights
Get you sipping on something you don't even like, girl
They don't know, but I know, I know you like
Truck tires on a two lane rolling
River rushing and a warm breeze blowing in
Hair all around to the sound
Of the radio singing in the background
Gravel grinding, while we're finding
A little spot I can make a fire in
Top popping on an ice cold beer
I know what you wanna hear
I know what you wanna hear, girl
Oh yeah, ain't that music to your ears?Jump the Broom
Adrienne Young / Will Kimbrough
"Join two hands, this broom step over
take a sweet kiss from your own true lover
Diamond birthright Painted Flower
Seventeen years and sixteen hours
Out the window stares a girl
Kentucky wonder head full of curls
She aint my mama this aint my world
Too much swine for just one Pearl
Jump the broom, jump the broom
Fly me away from this dark room
Cant go too far cant leave too soon
Love take my hand lets jump the broom
Broken bottle on the floor
Whiskey drippin down through the boards
Old man shoutin come back and fight
Young man run into the night
Was late ast summer down by the creek
Two young lovers fell warm and sweet
Kindred spirits kindred scars
Jordans Banks didnt seem so far
Jump the broom, jump the broom
Fly me away from this dark room
Cant go too far cant leave too soon
Love take my hand lets jump the broom
New moon risin dark and still
Pearls a droppin from her windowsill
Tears burn and gather in brown eyes
Little sister waves goodbye
Now young Coreys waitin down by the gate
Cant call the preacher
Its much too late
But that dont stop his bended knee no no
Pretty Pearl girl marry me!
Jump the broom, jump the broom
Fly me away from this dark room
Cant go too far cant leave too soon
Love take my hand lets jump the broomPour me a drink
Light me a cigarette
Help me forget
The things that i've done
Pour me a drink
And pour me another one
To keep out this cold wind
That blows through my soul
Look at my life
Here in these photographs
Look at these faces
What a story they tell
There was a time
When i knew how to laugh
I drink to forget
But i remember it well
Pour me a drink
Light me a ciggarette
Help me forget
The things that i've done
Pour me a drink
And pour me another one
To keep out this cold wind
That blows through my soul
So many promises
So many daydreams and plans
So many chances
That i let slip through my hands
Ohhhhhhhhhhh
Pour me a drink
Light me a cigarette
Help me forget
The things that i've done
Pour me a drink
And pour me another one
To keep out the cold wind
That blows through my soul
Keep out this cold wind
That blows through my soul
Hmmmmmmmmmm(Gordon Kennedy/Wayne Kirkpatrick)
They married on a fancy yacht out on the water
He knew she was young enough to be his daughter
There always questions in the heart of millionaires
Would she make heartfelt promises if the money was not there
And he said, do you love me, baby, do you want me to hold
Or are you just digging for gold
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul
Or are you just digging for gold
She ran his weary heart through the ringer
And she wore him like the diamond ring around her finger
Well, his advances and affections, she managed to avoid
But, she got the lap of luxury and he got paranoid
And he said, do you love me, baby, do you want me to hold
Or are you just digging for gold
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul
Or are you just digging for gold, digging for gold
Big house, limousines,
Fine wines, fine cuisines,
Vale and Vegas twice a year,
Trips to Paris on the leer
Black Tuesday when that wall of wealth came crashing down
Bad news day when that little queen had to give back her crown
And he said, hey babe, we can live on love 'cause love is worth much more
But he barely got his feelings out, she was half way to the door
And she never even heard him cry
Do you love me, baby, do you want me to hold
Or are you just digging for gold
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul
Or are you just digging for gold(Dolly Parton)
We might have slept in a rail yard or camped by the river bank
We fed ourselves from the fruit of the land
And quenched our thirst with rain
We never did allow no roots to grow beneath our feet
Life just had no pattern for Gypsy Joe and me
All we had was each other and the rags upon our back
The closest thing to a home we new was some abandoned shack
But we had all we needed and the rest we didn't need
Life was free and simple for Gypsy Joe and me
Now Gypsy was my little dog, I found by the road in a ditch
And so I named him Gypsy, cause that name just seemed to fit
Oh and Joe he was my man, the flower of my soul
Thou he never said he loved me, I just always seemed to know
While standing by the highway, thumbin' for a ride
The speeding wheels of a passing car, took Gypsy's life
I lost him where I found him and his loss was misery
Now there's no more Gypsy, there's just Joe and me
Well the winter came and the snow did fall
And the night was cold and still
And the rags we wore were not enough
And Joe he caught the chill
And he told me how he loved me
And in my arms he went to sleep
Now there's no more Gypsy, no more Joe, there's just me
While standin' here on the edge of this bridge
Lookin' down I see
The face of Joe and Gypsy, lookin' back at me
And somewhere in the distance I can hear them callin' me
Tonight we'll be together again
Gypsy, Joe and meLast night I dreamed an angel came he took my hand he called my name
He bade me look the other way I saw a man I heard him say
He said if I be lifted up I'll draw all men to me
He turned and then I saw the nail scared hands that bled for me
I touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there
My life my heart I gave my soul was in his care
(When I awoke) my heart beat so (and in the dark) I saw a glow
It was no dream he turned my way and then I heard my Saviour say
He said if I be lifted up...In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need
When the pool of tears beneath my feet, flood every newborn seed
There's a dyin' voice within me, reaching out somewhere
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake
Like cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
And every time I pass that way, I always hear my name
Then onward in my journey, I come to understand
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect finished plan
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sandHe's got a split finger wrap
And his rope's pulled way too tight
He's got a lunatic smile
'Cause he's really drawn deep tonight
He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever
Grab a hold-a anythin' and hold on tight
It hits you like a venom from a rattlesnake bite
We're all here 'cause he's not all there tonight
He takes one last breath
And time turns inside out
Then the gate busts open
To the world he dreams about
He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever
Stick a rope on anything 'cause he don't care
He'd even take a ride in an electric chair
We're all here 'cause he's not all there tonight
He says it's really kind of simple
Keep your mind in the middle
While your butt spins 'round and 'round
Take heed to Sankey's preachin'
Keep liftin' and reachin'
And ridin' like there ain't no clowns
Well what he loves might kill him
But he's got no choice
He's a different breed
With a voice down deep inside
That's screamin' he was born to ride
He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever
Fever makes you crazy 'cause it makes no sense
Like runnin' from your shadow out of self-defense
But he won't run and baby he can't hide
He thinks the odds are even leavin' one hand tied
He gets so tired of hangin' on so tight
I know you think he's crazy, well I think you're right
We're all here 'cause he's not all there
That's right!I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
Don't know why I have to drive so fast
My car has nothing to prove
It's not new
But it'll do zero to sixty in five point two
I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
Can't be late, I leave in plenty of time
Shakin' hands with the clock
I can't stop
I'm on a roll and I'm ready to rock
I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
I hear a voice
It says I'm running behind
I better pick up my pace
It's a race and there ain't no room for someone in second place
I'm in a hurry to get things done
I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
I'm in a hurry to get things done
I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
I'm in a hurry to get things done
I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
I'm in a hurry to get things done
I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know whyThere's a little dive on a dead-end road
Called the Cross-Eyed Cricket Waterin' Hole
Where you can hear the sound of a steel guitar
An' get loud an' rowdy with P-B-R
But at the top of every hour, man, you can hear a pin drop
As ol' Jack drops a quarter an' plays Merle on that jukebox, an' we stop
[Chorus]
An' tip our hats
An' raise our glasses of cold, cold beer
They say country's fadin'
But we still wavin' that flag around here
An' when it's time to go, you know you're welcome back
Where the people pledge allegiance to the Hag
When the weekend comes an' the weather's clear
There's a high spot fifteen miles from here
Where you can always find a few dusty trucks
With the windows down an' the radio up
We sit there poppin' tops, shootin' bull an' singin' songs
But you can bet your boots that when Haggard comes on
[Chorus]
One of these days when my time has come
You can take me back to where I'm from
Put me on a westbound train
An' ship me off in the pourin' rain
Don't cry for me when I'm gone
Just put a quarter in the jukebox an' sing me back home
An' tip our hats
An' raise our glasses of cold, cold beer
They say country's fadin'
But just keep wavin' that flag around here
An' I know, it'll keep on comin' back
Long as people pledge allegiance
Where folks still pledge allegiance
I pledge allegiance to the HagCall me and I will come,
See how I will run,
It's been so many years, but,
You're still the one,
Just call my name and I will come
Ready as I can be,
And oh you'll send for me,
And I'll be waiting here so patiently,
I'm ready now as I can be,
Maybe I'm a fool,
Loving you, like I do,
But I miss you every day,
And I see you in everything,
You're every song I hear and every word I say,
I miss you more every day,
"Instrumental"
Maybe I'm a fool,
But hope is all I have to hold on to,
So, call me and I will come,
See how I will run,
It's been so many years, but,
You're still the one,
Just call my name and I will come,
Just call my name and I will come.Are you weary and tired of living
Does it all seem to be thankless giving
Don't worry my friend it isn't the end
It's just a bend in the road
Have you reached for someone's hand
And found that's she just doesn't understand
Keep reaching my friend it isn't the end
It's just a bend in the road
It's never the end there's always one more bend
Another day another way a year or two
So walk one more mile remember with the smile
Happiness can afford to lose you
Although at times you feel so lonely
And you try to find someone to love you only
Keep looking my friend it isn't the end
There'll may be someone around the bend in the road
There'll may be someone around the bend in the roadNow and then, a loser wins
Gets a winning hand, now and then
Once in a while the angels smile
And someone's life turns out just right
Now and then dreams come true
When someone like me
Is loved by someone like you.
So many times I just couldn't believing
I'd never find the one to make my life worth living
Bur now and then miracles still happen
Oh I know they do cause I found you.
It'll always be a mystery
That in all this world you chose me
It's good to know that now and then
It all turns around and there's really a rainbows end
Now and then dreams come true
When someone like me
Is loved by someone like youIt was on a Wednesday night the moon was shining bright
They robbed the Glendale train
And the people they did say for many miles away
Twas the outlaws Frank and Jesse James
Jesse had a wife to mourn all her life
Their children they are brave
Twas a dirty little coward that shot Mr Howard
They laid Jesse James in his grave
It was Robert Ford the dirty little coward
I wonder how he does feel
For he ate of Jesse's bread and he slept in Jesse's bed
Then he laid Jesse James in his grave
Jesse had a wife to mourn all her life
It was his brother Frank that robbed the Gallatin bank
And carried the money from the town
It was in this very place that they had a little race
For they shot Captain Sheets to the ground
Jesse was a man a friend to the poor
He never would see a man suffer pain
And with his brother Frank he robbed the Chicago bank
And stopped the Glendale train
It was his brother Frank that robbed the Gallatin bank
And carried the money from the town
It was in this very place that they had a little race
For they shot Captain Sheets to the ground
Jesse had a wife to mourn all her life
They went to the crossing not very far from there
And there they did the same
And the agent on his knees he delivered up the keys
To the outlaws Frank and Jesse James
Jesse had a wife to mourn all her life
It was on a Saturday night Jesse was at home
Talking to his family brave
When the thief and the coward a little Robert Ford
Laid Jesse James in his grave
How people held their breath when they heard of Jesse's death
And wondered how he ever came to die
Twas one of the gang dirty Robert Ford
That shot poor Jesse on the sly
Jesse had a wife to mourn all her
Jesse went to rest with his hand on his breast
The devil will be upon his knee
He was born one day in the county of Clay
And came from the solitary race
Jesse had a wife to mourn all her life
They laid Jesse James in his graveI remember how the wood would smell
Just as the last great tree was felled
Like many that came before
It was used for table and a door
A palette and a long hall rack
Hung my great grandfather's hat
A stable and a barn, a bed and a seat
A roof and fence and a floor that creaked
And a coffin leanin against the wall
When there was a death in Arkansas
I liked the wagons and the wheels
The wind that knocked us down in the fields
And the girls with the southern drawl
And those that came before were the pictures on the wall
And the lone dogs howled and the crows would caw
When there was a death in Arkansas
We were laid to rest out under the sun
And we breathed our last
And it was done
And the air redeemed us and we would learn
That a life was hallowed and we wouldn't burn
Hands folded gently to say goodbye
It was just this place underneath the sky
Do you see our bones hidin like a toad
In the old red dirt that is now a road
Beneath the sign that blinks off on
And a shopping mall where the house is gone
Forgetting that a soul may call
When there is a death in Arkansas
And a quilten patch of new concrete
Helps the trucks roll down the street
There's a Dollar Store by the setting sun
And a sign on the church says His Will is Done
I can't see the birds or find the fields
That hold my bones beneath the wheels
And a mother worries that her son won't call
And a tv stares at a blinking wall
But the lone dogs howl and the crows still call
When there is a death in ArkansasShe had good intentions and I had the same
She kept the baby and left me the blame
We both had our reasons but they weren't the same
Ain't it funny, the way love can do ya?
We made a promise, we'd never break up our home
Or ever find reasons for leaving each other alone but we did
Once we were strangers, then we were friends
Next we were lovers, now we're strangers again
Ain't it funny, the way love can do ya? But it did
I had good intentions and she had the same
She kept the heartaches and left me the shame
We both have our memories but they're not the same
Ain't it funny, the way love can do ya?
We made a promise, we'd never break up our home
Or ever find reasons for leaving each other alone but we did
Once we were strangers, then we were friends
Next we were lovers, now we're strangers again
Ain't it funny the way love can do ya? But it didI think I'll go back down to New Orleans
Try to bury my travelin' bone
Unpredictable me, like I swore I would be
Nothing's ever written in stone
There's a knock on her door, is she here anymore
I guess me and the neighbors will see
If the one thing that I couldn't do without her
She couldn't do without me
Could I leave her behind, go on losin' my mind
While the good times continue to roll
With this time on my hands, I can change all my plans
And it really wouldn't bother a soul
I can make all the rounds, paint all the towns
Do all that and more on my own
But a man can't survive on happiness alone
Take a good look around, this is New Orleans
A free wheeler's got to feel right at home
But it's a hell of a leap, whether shallow or deep
That old river's gonna keep movin' on
Like that muddy Mississippi, she keeps pullin' me under
When you're in it, nothin' ever seems clear
I could stand on the bank just toss in my line
But there's way too many fish around here
Could I leave 'em behind for the one on the line
Are the good times still gonna roll
And with this time on my hands, I can change all my plans
And it really wouldn't bother a soul
I can make all the rounds, paint all the towns
Do all that and more on my own
But a man can't survive on happiness aloneHere's to the corners yet to turn
Here's to the bridges yet to burn
Here's to the whole thing blown apart
It's open season on my heart
Days go by like flying bricks
Leave gaping holes too deep to fix
I'd just stay home if I were smart
It's open season on my heart
I can't blame anyone but me
For this restless fool I've come to be
My tired excuses just don't fit
It don't look good from where I sit
I tried to change without much luck
I reach a point where I get stuck
I hit the streets and the fireworks start
It's open season on my heart
I can't be something that I'm not
I can't give you what I haven't got
I don't know where I'll while away
I only know the shape of you
Here's to the clown down in the mouth
Here's to the whole thing going south
Just stay home if I were smart
It's open season on my heart
I hit the streets and the fireworks start
It's open season on my heartYou say you're doin' better
For your sake I hope it's true
I wish you well
But that's all that I can do
Save your "I'm sorry's"
Just leave 'em out the door
You can't make me feel guilty anymore
You say I should stay with you
That Jesus forgives you
You pray I will, but I won't
The difference is
Jesus loves you, I don't
I know it sounds cruel
And it's really not like me, but
You've put me in a place
I never thought I'd be
These tears I'm crying
Are just tears of goodbye
I hope you find someone else
Somewhere in your life
Somewhere in your life
You say I should stay with you
That Jesus forgives you
You pray I will, but I won't
The difference is
Jesus loves you, I don't
I don't wanna know you still want me
Don't need to hear you can't sleep
No I don't, no I don't
You say I should stay with you
That Jesus forgives you
You pray I will, but I won't
The difference is
Jesus loves you, Oh I know
Jesus loves you, I don'tEvery step of the way every minute of the day devotedly I'll always be beside you
The seasons change but not my heart time will never see us part
I'll always care and I'll always be there every step of the way
Though winds of sorrow make you cry I'll be around
To kiss away the tears before they reach the ground
Every step of the way every minute of the day
I will love you every step of the way (every step of the way)
[ strings ]
The seasons change but not my heart...
Yes I will love you every step of the wayOnce in my youth, I stood on this mountain
And planted some pines in the sand
Every day I looked their way
But just couldn't understand
Why they never grew like I thought they should do
I just couldn't understand why
Now, I've rambled around this wide world through
And today I just happened by
Tall pines, tall pines
Reaching up for the clouds
Tall pines, tall pines
I bet you wouldn't know me now
I'll never forget the morning I left
The hum of the bees in the hay
The farther I walk, the harder they talk
How silent it seems here today
There's an old rail fence that we built, inch by inch
Surrounding the old family graves
And there's one gravestone standing all alone
There waiting to join me in the shade
Tall pines, tall pines
Reaching up for the clouds
Tall pines, tall pines
I've come home to sleep beneath your boughsYou call me a cheater well maybe that's true
But if you could hold heaven what would you do
He offered me true love that I never knew
I saw the door to heaven and just walked through
You'll never believe me I tried to be true
But with heaven at my fingertips what else could I do
You say you'd be different if this happened to you
But with your feet in my shoes I wonder what you'd do
If it's wrong to long for lost love then I'm wrong as I can be
You say it's wrong and that may be true but it sure seems right to me
You say you'd be different if this happened to you
But with heaven at your fingertips what would you doLet the music
breathe upon my face
every step of the way
through the anguish I make
Like the rest I made
I'm seeing you as clear and blue
like lovers do
and you should too
I'm not playing a game with you
to show that I can get ahead
Just like any weak man would do
when he's losing
When life's confusing way to bring you down
has got you pissing yourself
while you're thinking out loud
Try and figure out
the best approach to being true
like lovers do
and you should, you should too
I'm not playing a game with you
to show that I can get ahead
Just like any weak man would do
when he's losing
You can't just give it all away
This is all we have saved
There is nothing here between us
This is not what we had planned
There is so much more
Got nothing without each other
We've got nothing
I'm not playing a game with you
to show that I can get ahead
Just like any weak man would do
when he's losing...Dreaming Without You
The hopeful possibilities
Have come and gone away
We've both run out of reasons to stay
Who we are and who we thought we were has somehow changed
We kept trying anyway
It's just not gonna work
It's just not gonna fly
We've been frozen on the edge
Staring at good-bye
We've both reached for the stars
Shared the victories, shared the scars
Made each other's dreams come true
I never thought I'd do
My dreaming without you
You'll go one way, I'll go mine
And take some awkward steps
Almost free except for these regrets
Moving one's the only thing that we have left to do
No one can say we didn't see this through
But...
Repeat Chorus
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
We've both reached for the stars
Shared the victories, shared the scars
Made each other's dreams come true
I never thought I'd do
My dreaming without youShe was born in Kansas City
Raised in Arkansas
Fell in love with an ex-Marine
She already had three babies
He had one of his own
They came together
For another and me
Our family never shared
The same last name
But our family
Was a family, the same
(And they say)
Blood is thicker than water
Oh, but love is
Thicker than blood
Wreck out on the highway
Rain falling down
Lord, he must have
Fell asleep at the wheel
There's a number of people
Just standing around
Lord, I can't condemn
The fear that they feel
For that river of red
Could be the death of me
God, give me strength
And keep reminding me
That blood is thicker than water
Oh, but love is
Thicker than blood
And if blood is
Thicker than water
Then what are we fighting for?
We're all sons and daughters
Of something that
Means so much more
I see it on my TV
But I can't understand
Lord, it's one
Big contradiction to me
How in god's name
We love thy neighbor with fists
In our hands
And kill each other
When we just don't agree
Why can't we see the walls
We can't see through?
And see what God's
Been telling me and you
(And that is)
Blood is thicker than water
Oh, but love
Love is thicker than bloodThere's a thief in my bedroom but I'm not afraid
Thieves all get caught by mistakes that they've made
This one has torn my emotions apart somebody's stealing my heart
Well somebody's kisses are wet on my lip somebody's face is at my fingertips
Somebody's holding me tight in their grips somebody's stealing my heart
There's a thief in my bedroom
Well somebody's kisses(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
Baby don't say no so quick
This ain't about me trying to see how far that I can get
But ain't gonna lie, wouldn't mind just a little bit of you and I
Eye to eye, lips on lips
Swaying to the music real close
We can both use a little let go kind of night
Baby, if you want a good time
We can get on it
Just take a shot or you can sip on it
We'll find a floor, we can dance on it, slow song it
As far as I can tell that finger ain't got no ring on it
So come on, baby bring on it
It's one of those stars forming, love calling
But get you feeling alright night
That sounds good, don't it, don't it?
Every little thing you got you know
That I want it, want it
Sounds pretty good, don't it?
Well I just now seen that smile
And I bet it's been a minute
Since you tapped on into that wild and crazy side
So baby, let's do this tonight
Baby, that moon looks just right
But don't fight it
If you want a good time we can get on it
Take a shot or you can sip on it
We'll find a floor, we can dance on it, slow song it
As far as I can tell that finger ain't got no ring on it
So come on, baby bring on it
It's one of those stars forming, love calling
But get you feeling alright night
That sounds good, don't it, don't it?
Every little thing you got you know
That I want it, want it
It sounds pretty good, don't it?
So baby, let's get on it
You're gonna love it, you can bet on it
Karaoke, we can microphone it, whatever you want
As far as I can see that finger ain't got no ring on it
So come on, baby bring on it
It's one of those stars forming, love calling
But get you feeling alright tonight
Sounds good, don't it, don't it?
Every little thing you got you know
That I want it, want it
And it sounds pretty good now, don't it?
Yeah, don't it (Hey hey, hey)
Get you feelin' alright girl
Yeah, sounds pretty good, yeah don't it
Yeah, don't it baby (hey hey, hey)
Oh
Yeah sounds pretty good now don't itIt's been many years now since you left me
But your love and your mem'ries they're still like you
I've tried everything I could to forget you now there's only one thing left to do
I know it's not right this way I'm thinking
But then nothing's been right since you said we were through
I just can't stand another minute of this hurtin' so there's only one thing left to do
Now I hope God will understand and forgive me
And let me find the peace that I once knew
And meets me at the gates of heaven and says it's all right it's all right
It was the only thing left to do
I only hope that God meets me at the gates of heaven and says it's all right
It was the only thing left to do
